Having said that, I am a health freak who loves curry and Indian food and cannot eat full fat/calorie versions, so I often tweak mine. This recipe is amazing as is and is better than what most Indian restaurants serve.  To make it healthier, I used an 8 oz.can of tomato sauce, a 6 oz.can of tomato paste, and 1 cup of fat-free half and half.  The tomato paste will compensate for the liquidity of the fat-free half and half.  I also used about 1 tbs of olive oil in place of ghee, and used a little olive oil spray when I added the spices to the onions.  For the chicken, I marinated it in a yogurt/spice mixture and broiled it in the oven before mixing it with the tikka curry.  Like I said, original version is 10 stars, and IMHO so is the reduced fat version. I served it with whole wheat homemade roti and roasted peppers/green beans.  My Pakistani husband was more than impressed with the flavors and refused to believe it was healthy!  Thank you for this amazing recipe that will become a staple in our household!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. While it may seem like a lot of work, to the uninitiated, it is completely worth every second. I didn't change a thing, it's perfect the way it is. This has become a staple in my house. It freezes well, and even storing in the fridge as leftovers- reheats superbly.

Sweet Baby Jesus! This is THE Tikka Masala recipe for the masses as well as the elites! Simple to prepare and wonderful to consume! I recommend preparing this dish just as it is written...then modify if you want. The recipe here provides a wonderful dish with a little heat but not a burn. PERFECT IN MY OPINION!  I like heat and will probably add more next time but it is not necessary as this dish is absolutely perfect the way it is. Golf clap!

Being Indian and having my mom make amazing masala sauce, I would say this recipe was very good!  I would personally add more chili pepper, add a tsp of garam masala, and 1 tsp of ground coriander as well.  Really comes out fantastic!

This is amazing and has saved us money since we no longer have to go to an Indian resturant.  Couple of notes if you are going to alter this in any way, the portion of cream to tomato is very important or the flavor will be off, I had two 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce and used both, simply added two additional tablespoons of cream and it was perfect.  Also the curry is a must in this!  When tasting the recipe before adding the chicken thought it didn't have the right balance, after the chicken was added and the curry blended into the sauce...Wow!  So if you are going to try making a veg variation with chickpeas or paneer, suggest adding the curry for the chicken directly into the sauce.  Such a fantastic and easy recipe!!

I used to use a different Tikka Masala recipe that was on this site. I have deleted that one from my recipe box!!! This has a great flavour and I make it with out too much spice as my stomach doesn't like too much cayenne but my hubby can add more when I serve. I like to marinate my chicken in plain yogurt with some curry, tiny bit of cayenne, cinnamon and bit of turmeric for a couple hours and then skewer and bbq, then I pull it off the skewer and add to the sauce, also add some peas or green beans for a little veggie! Thank you thank you thank you for submitting this recipe!!!!

I haven't reviewed a recipe here in a long time but I had to add my voice to the resounding raves for this dish. Indian food is the cuisine I have the least experience with and I honestly didn't know what to expect from the mixture of spices as I was making this. However, I was looking for something different and hoped for the best. This dish is absolutely delicious. It has a very complex flavor- sweet, hot, tangy, spicy- every component adds to it and I can't imagine omitting a thing. The only thing I did differently was that I used boneless chicken thighs, as it was what I had, and they became tender and moist in the sauce. This recipe makes a lot of sauce and in the future I will double that and freeze some (as some reviewers say it freezes well). It was so delicious, my fiance and I are already talking about when we will make it next! Next time I may try adding in some chickpeas or cubed potatoes or squash when I'm sauteeing the chicken, to soak up every bit of the delicious sauce. But I wouldn't omit or change the ratio of spices, as it's perfect as-is. Fantastic!

Absolutely loved this!!! It tastes just like the Tikka Masala from our favorite Indian restaurant, we are in love! And it really is surprisingly simple!
Because there are so many; the ingredient list may look daunting to the novice, but the directions are so simple and direct that it should be no problem for even said novice! 
One good cooking trick I like, when so many ingredients - especially spices - need to be added at once, is to measure them all out ahead of time in a separate bowl. I like to dumb each measurement into a nice neat pile in the bowl so I can keep track of what I've already measured out. Then when the time comes to add the spices I can just dump them all in at once and don't run the risk of burning any of the spices while I'm still measuring and dumping others.
I also started the chicken (and upped the curry to 3/4tsp) while the sauce was simmering for 10-15 min after adding the cream (side note: YES you MUST use heavy cream if you want this to be the real deal!). You could also start the chicken while sauce is simmering for the first 10 min before adding cream and set it aside to wait for later. Either way, start the chicken while your sauce is simmering to help cut down on time.
One last thing, I used a sauce pan for the sauce part instead of a skillet. The higher sides make it so much easier to stir quickly and continuously. ;)

Made this recipe twice. Tonight I substituted the heavy cream with coconut milk and just a wee bit more curry. It was amazing. This sauce will lend itself to more than chicken. It reacts well to personal tweaks too. Fantastic!

This is by far the best recipe I’ve made on allrecipes.com (and I’ve made a ton.) The result is the most flavorful, savory, and rich sauce. If you love that orange saucy tikka masala, this recipe is definitely for you. This is even better than the one they serve in town and is a big hit in my home. We have already prepared this 4 times and will continue to do so.
I made some slight tweaks though to suite personal preferences. Since I didn’t have any ground ginger on hand, I substituted 1 Tbs freshly grated ginger.  This I cooked along with the garlic and onion. I coated my diced chicken ahead of time with the seasonings. Along with the curry powder, I also added 2 tsp garam masala, and salt to taste. Doing this will result in the most delightfully tasting chicken. Because of this, I reduced the initial cinnamon used in the sauce down to ¼ tsp.
Spooning this on top of rice and garnishing with cilantro really adds the finishing touch! We can’t get enough of this recipe. One of my favorites! Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe and outstanding comments!! Motivated me to give it a try, marinated the chicken beforehand overnight, was luxurious! The masala needed a little something, was good to start with, comments really work for this recipe. :)

This was easy to make and tastes great! My husband has been to India many times and he says this is the closest he's had to a good curry since being over there and we've been to lots of Indian Restaurants. Next time we are going to add some potato to it and see how we like it.

So glad I found this recipe!  It's exactly what I was looking for: Cheap, easy, and delicious.  Make sure you don't forget to garnish with a little chopped cilantro at the end - it finishes the dish perfectly.

This is exquisite!  I have no words for the sheer amount of amazing that this recipe creates - it's been a hit every time I make it and is one of the rare recipes where I don't fiddle with the spices.  It is, in a (woefully inadequate) word: PERFECT.

This recipe is fantastic. We had some leftover heavy cream from an appetizer I made for a Super Bowl party. I saw this recipe and decided to try it. My husband was home from work and he is actually the one who made it, so I don't know if he made any changes. If I had to guess, I would say he added more curry. I really want to make this again, but I don't usually cook with cream. It may be reserved for special occasions or  I may try it with light coconut milk instead of the cream. Thanks for the recipe. It was a real treat.

This was delicious! It tastes 10 times better than any chicken tikka masala I've had at a restaurant or from carryout. Don't change anything and don't make any substitutions. For the love of God, don't try to make it "healthier". Just make it, eat it, and enjoy the one life you have.

This is sooooooo delicious!  A bit too much cayenne for me, maybe 1/2 tsp. next time.  But other than that, so good!

This recipe is fantastic! Hands down the best homemade chicken tikka masala that I have tried. It does taste very close to the beloved restaurant version. I used garam masala instead of curry powder and half and half instead of cream otherwise followed the recipe. Definitely make this!

I chose this recipe over others because I didn't have yogurt on hand.  A few weeks later, I got my yogurt and made one of the other Chicken Tikka Masala recipes that call for it.  This recipe is much better than the version with yogurt.  Excellent flavor!!

My husband and I have always loved cooking and trying new foods. After watching a show about Indian cuisine, it seemed like a perfect new project. I spent quite a while looking for an easy, relatively mellow introduction. I can't comment on the actual authenticity, but it was every bit as good as the Indian restaurants that I've been too, and he enjoyed his first Indian meal. The only variation that we made to the recipe was to start by par-cooking the chicken and removing it from the pan to make the sauce rather than using a second pan. Sooo good, and the house smelled great!

Almost perfect. I had to add a cup of milk to get it to the right consistency, and I added 1/2 cup of finely ground cashews to give it that luxurious richness. This is my new go-to recipe!

It was great, but I think I will take out the tablespoon of sugar.  Do not overheat the onions or garlic or they will turn bitter!

Delicious recipe!  I don't like much heat and this was perfect - just a tiny little kick.  And so quick and easy.  I actually made it with seitan, tofu, and tempeh, as we are vegetarians.  I think I liked the tempeh the best.  My husband loved it, but would prefer some veggies in there, so I may try it with some red pepper and cauliflower next time.  I also used coconut milk instead of cream and it was perfect (still used the ghee, 'cause ghee is awesome, so it wasn't vegan, though you could easily make it vegan by using Earth Balance margarine).

I tried the other chicken tikka recipe on this site and liked it a little bit more. This one was very good, however, but a bit too sweet for my tastebuds. I did omit the salt entirely (not needed) and would omit the sugar next time. Also I used non-fat cream and the consistency and flavor was good. The only other thing that I might change is to add a bit more butter (didn't use ghee) as an emulsifier to blend in all of the spices more. Good recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

This was really good!!  I didn't have ghee so I used regular butter and put in half the cayenne since Indian food can be really spicy which I'm glad I did because it was perfect.  I also did not add the optional salt and sugar at the end.  I made it with almond milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 because that is what I had.  It was so good like that but I can imagine it would be even better with the cream.

It was a little spicy for the kids but we loved it - flavors had blended even better next day. I sub'd non-fat plain yogurt for the heavy cream (fat content was rather high) and thought it tasted fab

I have been really getting into cooking lately and wanted to make Indian food.  I found the recipe and took other peoples instructions to half the cayenne pepper.  Everything else was done exactly as this recipe describes.  This really is a 5 star recipe.  Its fairly easy to do and the flavor was like my favorite Indian restaurant.  TOP NOTCH AND THANK YOU!!!!!!

OMGoodness!! This was de’freakin’licous! If you were here I’d hug you!! I substituted a few items only because I did not have them in my pantry.  Substitutions are tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, yogurt instead of cream, agave/honey instead of sugar, chicken thighs and drumsticks instead of breasts. To thin the paste I stirred in no salt chicken broth in the onion and spice sauce. I baked the thighs and drumsticks on 335 until almost tender. I also seasoned the meat with black pepper, curry, and Island Spice chicken blend. I was familiar with the dish as I normally order it with lamb at restaurants. I am going to make it again with lamb.

This recipe is my personal favorite. I serve it at all of my parties, and it's always a big hit. I transfer the sauce and chicken into the slow cooker as I finish them and let them cook on high for 4 hours instead of simmering them in the pan. That way I can make a double batch using my largest pan for both the sauce and the chicken, and have time to get ready for the party while it cooks away.

This was good chicken tikka masala. I did not have any cream, so I subbed 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup greek yogurt and it turned out fine. I will have to make this again when I have cream! Thanks.

This is the only chicken tikka masala recipe I make.  I think it tastes BETTER than the same dish at my favorite Indian restaurant (Mirch Masala in Colorado Springs), and that's saying a LOT.  The heavy cream is so decadent and so delicious with the  rich spice blend and tomato flavor.  I admit that I use the really expensive San Marzano crushed tomatoes (instead of sauce) in this recipe, as well as meat from a whole rotisserie chicken (because I love the juiciness of dark-meat chicken), and sometimes I put cilantro on top.  Other than that I don't alter it!  Try this ASAP, you'll LOVE it!

Rather spicy, if you like a noticeable heat to your food then stick with the amount of cayenne given, if you aren't a spicy food person cut it in half. I like spicy so I thought this was great.  Made over rice with roasted asparagus with garlic as a side. Delicious!

This recipe was very good, and better than most that I have tried ... BUT ... It has too much cumin, which turns into the predominant flavor that overshadows all the rest. Next time, I will try using 2 tsp of cumin and see how it turns out.

YUMMMMM.  Just the right amount of spice, perfectly balanced.  My husband made his "yum" face for about 15 minutes after he first tasted it.  This is definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I might change a couple of things so I gave it four stars.  One thing I would do is use yogurt instead of heavy cream, and use slightly less than what's called for.  It waters down the flavor a tad too much.  Perhaps just a scant bit less.  
I would also use red chili powder instead of cayenne next time, and by that I don't mean chili powder that you buy at most grocery stores.  It's a specific Indian spice that I only have found at a little mom and pop Indian shop near Pike Place market (for you Seattle-ites).  I think this would give the dish a slightly more authentic flavor, but otherwise the ratio and types of spices were perfect and delish!  I love the way the onions and garlic are cooked in this recipe, it's just perfect.  
Also, instead of ghee (don't have any!) I used coconut oil which was awesome because it is also very pure, but  I didn't taste the coconut flavor over the other flavors in the dish.  It may have added a slight layer of flavor but not enough to be an issue.  If I could just master homemade naan, I wouldn't need to go to an Indian restaurant again!

We tried this recipe tonight and I was true to the instructions except for the ghee. I just used regular butter but all other ingredients were per the recipe. This was awesome! Just what we look for in a good saucy curry. We added cauliflower when sautéing the chicken.

I was a little doubtful that this would turn out like the restaurant tikka masala, but it all came together in the pan.  I was so pleasantly surprised and this was so easy (and a forgiving recipe as well).  My husband doesn't like Indian food (while I love it). Now that I have a great and simple recipe to cook my favorite dish at home, we'll never have to go to the restaurant again.  I didn't have any heavy cream at home, so I used a can of full fat coconut milk and it worked out great.  I didn't have any tomato sauce from the can or onion, but I used diced tomatoes in a can with onion (still same volume) and it still worked.  Wonderful recipe, Chris!

My friend just made this a few days ago and shared a generous amount of it with me today. I'm glad she didn't give me any more or I'd be in a food coma right now. I don't even like curry! I. Don't. Like. Curry..... Man, I wish I had some more of this curry right now. Stellar recipe. :o)

This was absolutely FANTASTIC   We could not help smacking our lips at the flavours.  My daughter  even ate some leftovers for brunch. We love Indian food but I don't have much knowledge of the spice mixes or ratios to use so to have this recipe turn out so beautifully without a lot of effort has put this recipe at the very top of my favourite  main dishes. Believe me - it is very easy to make and not at all time consuming - you probably have all of the ingredients on hand already and the aroma was absolutely gorgeous. My sincere compliments and a huge Thank You to the provider of this recipe. I will definitely try any others that you submit.

This is absolutely delicious! I’ve made this so many times I’ve lost count. Very layered flavors and you can adjust the heat and sweetness easily to your liking. I’ve also used half & half with no problem. If you’re looking for a different recipe for chicken, try this! It’s amazing!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was so unbelievably delicious. I have never had this in a restaurant, so I can't compare it, but this is the best thing I have ever done with chicken in my cooking life. I don't even usually like chicken breast, usually I find it too dry, but this was moist and bursting with an incredibly delicious complex flavor. If not for the cream, I would make this every week, but still I think it will end up in a twice-a-month rotation in our house. So good!!!

We love any kind of curry....   and this was not disapointing!!  I was raised with an East Indian relative(through marriage) and have become accustomed to cooking different curries, usually tomato based, not creamy, and this one will be added to our book and made again many times.  Served with steamed rice and homemade roti bread.

I usually double the recipe and freeze portions for later, HUGE favorite in my house.
I will add jalepenos/habaneros if we are feeling spicy, and you can substitue chickpeas if you're interested in going meatless.

Delicious and restaurant quality. Followed the recipe with small changes. I used fresh ginger instead of ground, doubled the cayenne (I am a huge spicy fan) , and used 3 chicken breasts instead of four (I like my curry to be on the saucier side). Turned out great and very easy to make! Served it with basmati rice.

My son found this recipe and made it this weekend when he was home. Delicious! As others have said, very close to the version from our favorite Indian restaurant. We cut the cayenne pepper in half, and used canola oil since we didn't have ghee handy. Reheats beautifully the next day. May try it with plain low fat yogurt rather than cream sometime to lower the cholesterol content.

I made this recipe for my husband and I, when the kids were at a sleepover, since we don't always get to eat the spicy foods we love when I am cooking for all of us.  We LOVED this recipe, and it was easily adjusted for what we had on hand.  Instead of ghee, I used unsalted butter - didn't have tomato sauce, so I substituted crushed tomatoes - no turmeric, so used curry instead - and lastly, didn't have whipping cream, so substituted evaporated milk.  It was heavenly!!  I'm reheating leftovers tomorrow, and will add some unsweetened coconut milk to cut down the spice for the kids, but I know they will love this, too.  Thanks, Chris, for a wonderful recipe!

We liked this a lot. I didn't use all the cayenne, personal preference. For some reason some of my chicken came out tough, when the other 3 breasts in the package cooked last night (none of it marinated) were not tough. I have no explanation for this so I'm going to assume it's my error. Thanks for sharing!

My BF loved this recipe.  I personally thought it was too spicy.  The chicken was very tender, melted in your mouth without any extra marinating or brining.  We served this over rice and had with Naan bread.  I don't know if this is something I would do again.

Best curry recipe on the entire Allrecipes website! I did make some modifications, however, namely converting this entire recipe to the Instant Pot! I doubled the entire recipe for my 8 qt Instant Pot. Started the IP on Sautee and the More setting and sauteed the onions and the garlic until the onions were soft and translucent(I swapped the fresh garlic out for Garlic paste) then tossed in the chicken and continued to sautee until all of the chicken was white on the outside. Next up I tossed in ALL of the seasonings and stirred to combine then added the Tomato sauce. Close the lid then hit the manual button for 10 minutes on High pressure. Once its done quick release and stir in the heavy whipping cream and heat until warmed through. I served it on some Basmati rice in a bowl and it came out really good! I highly recommend!

I only gave it five stars because I couldn't rate it higher. This is an excellent recipe. We cut the cayenne in half but kept everything else. Definitely oo la la!

Here's how you make this recipe awsome.
First skip onion and sweet pepper.
Then use 1.5 TBSP cumin, 1/2-3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 cayenne, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 TBSP butter, 1 TBSP olive oil, 1 TBSP Pinot Grio White wine, 1/4 onion powder, 1/4 nutmeg, 3 green cardamom, 1 black cardamom, Patak's Tandoori Masala.  Scar chicken aggressively, premarinate with Patak & yogurt, toast spices until aroma, strain heated tomato sauce.  Combine, add cut chicken direct & cover.  Cook on medium 10 min, uncover, cont cooking, slowly add cream & sugar, add cardamom near end, when it taste balanced (slightly lacking intense) just let thicken on low - medium heat.  Never add cream before 25 minute mark; don't make it too creamy nor too tomato-y, nor too salty, careful with salt, sugar is the last balancer, never use clove (taste like flower).  The key to rice is to let stand for 10-15 covered no heat.  The most velvety, best tikka you will make.

This tikki masala was a huge hit! But it came with many changes.  My changes make it a low-carb/keto's dream, and my non-keto boyfriend loved it!

Many people are saying it's missing something. The answer: more butter! Get European butter if you can. (eg KerryGold, it's much creamier. It's usually in the butter aisle or where the specialty cheeses and meats are. Trust me, you will never go back to American-style butter after you get this stuff.) I usually put in another 2-4 TBS of butter while the sauce thickens and when I add the chicken. This gives it that "something"-a nice, savory taste, which is what you want in a tikki masala.

Nix the sugar, you won't need it, especially with sweet butter.

WAY MORE CREAM! And yes, you need heavy cream, no low fat nonsense here! I added at least 2 cups to make it savory.

If your spicy sensitive as I am, cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp and add the extra cream mentioned above to tone it down.

Chicken-mix the raw chicken with a spice mixture of half of the cumin called for, (put the rest in to the sauce when it says to), garam masala, (seriously, a masala recipe that DOESN'T call for garam masala? It is a hard to find spice, but if you have it, use it! If not, either look up how to make a substitute mixture of that spice or just keep it out) and the curry.  Sear as per instructions with the spice mixture on the chicken-delish!

Enjoy and happy cooking!

After reading all the rave reviews today, I decided it would be the perfect dinner for us tonight! I followed quite closely, but did take other reviews into account somewhat.  Decided to use full fat half and half that I already had on hand and it was still thick and rich with flavor. Since we enjoy spicy dishes, I did double the cayenne and also added a little ground coriander and garam masala as was suggested in addition to all the other spices. My husband and I absolutely loved this and practically licked our plates :) I will definitely be making this again soon and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants true Indian flavors and loves ethnic food. Thanks All Recipes for a home run!

Oh wow, this is soooo good! Made it twice. The first time I used 1 tsp of cayenne like the recipe stated. I thought it was perfect, but not everyone agreed. I used 2 tsp the next time, everyone loved it, but I thought it was too hot. So I added a little sour cream to mine, and it was perfect. The combination of spices is fantastic. Very easy recipe, foolproof. Served with white rice, but want to try naan bread next time!

this recipe is awesome. people that don't like it either did it wrong or don't understand what tikka masala is. this is probably the only time in allrecipes.com history that I didn't make 302 changes to a recipe and made it as is and it was PERFECT. As far as indian food goes and the multitude of spices they use, this really isn't that complicated. I served over jasmine rice with a cilantro garnish, the green really pops against the neon orange and this dish is totally good enough for company. Thanks Chris.

Loved everything about it. The only part of the recipe I didn't follow to the letter was using butter instead of ghee. Added the optional sugar but not salt. DS and I (the spice wimps) agreed that next time I could use the tiniest hair less cayenne, and DBF could sprinkle a bit extra on his portion. Made half a recipe to try it out (and because I only had a small can of tomato sauce)...from now on, making the full recipe :)

This is an excellent recipe for adventurous adults or those used to Indian cuisine. My family doesn't enjoy traditional Indian food much but I was feeling froggy. My 3 yo hated it with a passion lol but my burger and fries husband really liked it, especially after a generous topping of chopped cilantro (TRY IT!!). I doubled the recipe and used reg butter, half and half, & halved the heat subbing 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for the double batch. I only had about 1 lb ckn so I lightly fried 3 lg cubed potatoes in a sprinkling of salt, pepper, sugar, onion powder and curry. Did the same for the cubed ckn. I think the potato and cilantro are a must for this recipe. Also, even after cutting the heat, it still had a pleasant tingle to it (btw I am a fan of spicy). Had I followed the recipe this would have been nearly too spicy to eat!

I'm a big fan of Indian food and this is the BEST homemade tikka masala I've tried.  The only change I made was using regular butter instead of ghee.  I love that I could easily find the ingredients in my cupboard or fridge and didn't need to go to a specialty shop.  Thanks so much for posting this!!

Great recipe!  Now I don't have to bribe my friends and family to go to an Indian restaurant!  I made it exactly as written (something I rarely do).  Next time I'll a lot of sauce and freeze it for later.

I LOVED this recipe! As most people say, it is perfect and I agree. It’s really hard to believe it’s that good until you make it but it is delicious. In my opinion, it tastes better than most Indian restaurants and not nearly so oily. I feel very guilt eating this in a restaurant but this is much healthier. My husband is Indian and he even said it was very good so I will definitely be cooking this again. My eight year old daughter who is a picky eater, even liked this and she won’t eat most Indian food. My four old gobbled it up. I am very excited to find a dish my whole family loves.

I'm on love!  Made a double batch so I'd have left overs. With 4 people eating not much left. But as good as it was tonight I know it will be even better tomorrow. 
I added an extra tsp of cayenne because of some reviews saying it didn't have heat. Mines did lol.  Maybe a little much for one guest but he'll be ok.

Amazing! Other than upping the cayenne to 1 1/2tsp I made this as is. Last time I made it and there wasn’t  enough heat for us, it was still really good but we like spicy. Adding that extra half teaspoon really helped in that area. Served it with the garlic naan recipe from all recipes. Thanks for sharing!

My family loves Indian food, so I decided to try to make this myself, rather that always eating out!  I did add a little more of the spices as we like our food a little on the spicy side, and it turned out amazing!  I will definitely be making this again!

I love Indian food never ever thought I could learn to make it from scratch..... this was amazing.  I did substitute coconut milk for whipping cream and added a little whole milk ... it was delish.  Now I’m going to try more Indian food recipes.  Got recipe from a all recipe magazine sent to my home... but this is the same ...yummy

I love Allrecipes and I have a lot of great go-tos from this website. This is by far THE BEST recipe that I’ve made off of this website. I followed the recipe but instead of the ghee butter, I used vegetable oil and I cooked the chicken fully in a different skillet then transferred it to the amazing God sauce with all the spices. We love Indian food and we have eaten at 5 star Indian restaurants and I can tell you, this tastes EXACTLY THE SAME.

Ok y'all I am not a great cook.  Nonetheless, this came out AMAZING.  The sauce I made pretty much as written (maybe had a heavy hand with the spices but otherwise no changes and skipped the cayenne).  But I did not cook the chicken before adding it to the sauce- I  just cut up the raw chicken and threw it in with cut up potatoes (frozen) peas and (frozen) chopped spinach for the last 30 minutes of cooking.  The potatoes were tender, the chicken was cooked through and even my husband and 2 year old ate it (!!).  Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

I use this app to cook at least 3 meals a week but I almost never review anything (I know I should but dang it I’m busy). I just had to review this recipe. It was amazing just as it was...no tweeking necessary! I put all my ingredients out on my counter to start and combined my spices according to the recipe. I made some white rice and a salad to go with this. The leftovers were amazing! That made it super fast and easy to assemble. Just give it a try.

I made it as stated and it was very good. A little hot for my wimpy palate, but my husband loved it. Cut down on the cayenne if you don't like the heat!

OMG, this is a bomb! If you want to show your Indian food lover friend/family that you can cook authentic Indian food, make this. I found this recipe about 3 months ago and I made it about 4 times already, making 4 times the recipe every time, and freezing the leftover to deal with the emergency cravings in the family later. All my family loves this! I usually serve this curry with Trader Joe's naan bread, or coconut rice made with a recipe from this site. It is a staple now. Thank you!

Served it over Jasmine rice. I added more curry to the chicken. I only had smoked paprika but it worked great. I also added a bit of garam masala once the sauce was almost done. I will definitely be making this for my family again. They couldn't stay out of the kitchen while I was cooking and loved the flavor once it was done.

I have been on this app for over a year and never wrote anything about a dish. THIS IS AMAZING. Made it as is and it’s delicious. Highly highly recommend if you enjoy saucy dishes. My 2 year absolutely loves it so I cut back on the heat for her.

Very impressed.  As a vegetarian, I omitted the chicken for a can of drained chick pea, but kept the spices for the chicken marinade.  I did add a little more cayenne pepper as well as a TSP of red pepper flake for a heat that's a little different than the cayenne.  This recipe is now a regular in my house.

This was yummy, but super spicy!! I'll probably make it again sometime, just without so much spice. I used chickpeas in mine since I didn't have all of the chicken needed.

As if this recipe needs another five star review but I had to comment on how delicious his turned out! It was so authentic, just like the Indian restaurant that we frequent. I’ve tried to make other recipes before but this was so easy and tasty! I omitted the cayenne pepper due to kiddos eating, but otherwise followed the instructions. Perfect! Thanks so much for this keeper Chris!

I've made this twice, once following the recipe exactly and once making some tweaks. I liked it following it exactly as is, it's by far the closest recipe I've found to my favorite Indian restaurant's tikka masala. I LOVED it with my tweaks - it tasted almost identical to my favorite Indian restaurant's! 

My tweaks: 1. Cut back the tomato sauce - I actually did this because I only had an 8oz can on hand when I was making it. It was so creamy and flavorful. 
2. I added about a teaspoon of garam masala because I had it on hand. Probably not necessary but was good. 
3. I used chickpeas & russet potatoes because I just prefer vegetarian dishes.

I really liked this! I chopped the chicken and let the curry marinade on it in the fridge for a few hours. I also put all the spices in a little bowl so they were ready to go when the onion and garlic was ready. VERY good. Will become a staple in our house.

I really enjoy this recipe. I am working on tweaking it a little bit just to find my optimum spice but it is really good. So good in fact that when I went to a restaurant and ordered chicken curry, I was unimpressed because this recipe tasted better!

My 2nd review here and again, am letting you all know i do not cook. I am 63 and was tired of wasting money when eating out, it became hit or miss. The first time i made this, i was AMAZED how great it came out. The 2nd time i used coconut milk and it was really not so great. So i'm sticking with heavy cream. Wow, i'm so happy i now can make at home the favorites i could only get in pricey restaurants.  The videos of these recipes help me tremendously, because i am NOT A COOK, but am becoming one, slowly...:)

This has become a go-to for me in the last year. It's not too tough to make, doesn't require any exotic ingredients I can't find in my area, and tastes great. Just cook up some rice, slather some chicken over it, and voila. Enjoy the heat.

I've made this multiple times and the mix of spices is amazing.  To me, it's like the next step up from Butter Chicken. I use coffee cream (aka half-and-half in the US) instead of whipping cream. The second time I made it was just for the sauce, because I had a half of a roast chicken to use up. I just de-boned the chicken, then added the chicken pieces to the pan after stirring in the cream and letting it heat through on low heat for about 20 min.  As a side dish, try the Indian Curried Barley Pilaf recipe, also in AR, and naan bread. If you want, marinate the uncooked chicken pieces ahead of time in a mixture of yogurt and about 1 tbsp of garam masala, then keep in the fridge until it's time to cook the chicken (no need to remove the marinade).

Each year for New Year’s Eve I pick 5 new recipes and carry over 3 from previous years that were liked. It’s hours of cooking and talking with family and friends who come by because they know the long-standing tradition and are looking to be part of the feast. This particular dish was a new addition this year. It was fantastic!  It easily accommodates individual spiciness levels and has an outstanding flavor. I have no doubt that it will become part of the foundation of our annual feast - and many times throughout the year.

This tikka masala is perfect!  I didn’t change a thing and it was delicious.  The whole house smelled with the wonderful aroma.

I never thought we could make restaurant quality Indian at home. Amazing! We followed the recipe except for the ghee - we just used butter. We will definitely be making this again. That you for a wonderful recipe!

After a few different ways off making this dish. I have added green beans,  potatoes, and peas and red/cayenne peppe, while removing the sugar. Highly recommend adding the vegertable; it makes the dish more full.

One of the best curry recipes I've ever made. My family loved it! I served it with buttered Turmeric Jasmine rice (w/cloves) and Garlic Naan. I used Garam Marsala in place of regular curry power and used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4. I will definitely make this again.

Very balanced and once you have all the spices necessary, easy to make dish. Watch out for the strength of your cayenne pepper, it may burn a hole in your stomach!

I love this!! I used my Instant Pot.  Saute mode for the sauce and spices - I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1 teaspoon each of coriander and garam  masala, and omitted the sugar.  Pressure cooked the chicken for 8 minutes.  Saute mode again and added the heavy cream and sauteed another 5 minutes.  So good!  Going to make this again and again.  Thank you!!

Tastes just like it came from the restaurant, if not better! Followed the recipe and it was delicious! I usually season the meat myself when a recipe doesn't mention it because otherwise I expect it to be bland. But for this recipe, I didn't add any extra salt or seasoning to the chicken. The recipe was perfect and super easy! Will definitely make this again!

This was FABULOUS! We've had it twice already, and it's going to be a part of our regular meal rotation for sure. 
Didn't make any changes, except for altering the heat  via the cayenne pepper. (we love heat)
Perfect served with naan or rice.

This is SO delicious! I did use evaporated milk in place of the cream and I didn't cook it as long as was stated because even though I simmered it, it was plenty thick and if I cooked the chicken in the sauce for 30 minutes it would have been way overcooked. The flavors are wonderful and it smells great. I served it over rice with peas on the side. I am adding it to the rotation. One of these days I will use cream.

So good I’m making my first review.  I’ve lived in London and have tried a lot of this dish in restaurants.  This recipe is world class.  

I’m far from an expert cook, and tried to make as close as possible as written. But I used butter (didn’t have ghee) and coconut milk vs cream (because I love it).  I cut the cayenne pepper in half for family members used to bland (but add it back on my dish), and cut the sugar a little to 1 tsp with 1 tsp stevia.  Simmered for an hour to reduce the runnier coconut milk and infuse flavor in the chicken a little more.  Superb over basmati rice.

So I bought the ingredients for a different Masala recipe, then accidentally pulled up this recipe and started making it. Half way through making it I realized what I did. So I combined a few of the ingredients from the original recipe I shopped for. 

I added 2 TBS of Garam Masala....this was so needed! I’m glad I added it!
Half a cup chicken stock
Small can of tomato paste 

Otherwise a delicious recipe either way!

AMAZING!!!! Perfect as is. Didn't add anything extra . Super picky teen and husband both loved!!! Cooked in a cast iron pot for extra flavor and tender chicken. Served over mixture of uncle bens jasmine and basmati rice (microwaveable, bc hey I work) with garlic naan bread and sautéed spinach. This one is worthy of taking the time to write a review! Taste straight out of an Indian restaurant!!! One of the best on this website!!

Loved this! We eat at a local Indian restaurant on a regular basis, and this is my favorite dish. I've always been skeptical of trying this at home, but took a chance on this recipe, and boy did it pay off! The only thing that I did differently, was reduce the amount of cayenne pepper to half. For me it was perfect, but my husband would have liked it a little spicier. Great dish. Will make again!

I followed the review almost exactly, but I didn't want to spend $8 on ghee so I used vegetable oil. I'm going to buy the ghee next time because I'm sure it offers a flavor that cannot be had with the oil. However, this recipe is DELICIOUS! I was worried about the sauce lacking something, but by default it had to rest a few hours and I think that rest really helped it blend. I added salt, sugar, and curry powder to the chicken before I browned it and it was delicious even before it met the sauce. I love spicy so next time I'm doing 1.5 tbsp of cayenne, but this was pleasantly spicy (it made my nose run). It's love. I feel like making it again every day next week! Thank you for this amazing and easy recipe!!

I've made this so many times, I usually serve it with the "Indian basmati rice" recipe from this site. I add more cayenne like Mr. Chris does because I too like it spicy, other than that I don't change a thing. Spice list is long which made it seem intimating at first but it's a piece of cake to make and now my friends think I'm a chef!

I never, ever leave reviews... even though I cook off of Allrecipes several times a week.  However, I loved this recipe so much that I thought it warranted creating an account and leaving 5 stars.  While the list of ingredients looks intimidating, it really doesn't take all that long to prepare.  A lot of the time is 'idle' while letting it simmer.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Very, very good. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was just perfect for me. My daughter is not into spicy things and thought it was a little too spicy. I made cucumber raita, jasmine rice and served it with Naan. Great recipe.

Loved the recipe! By far my favorite I've made thus far! Only change I made was to marinate the chicken overnight in 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

I thought that this was one of the best tikka masala recipes I've made.  I've been cooking Indian food for a number of years and really liked this one.  I followed it just about exactly, but I had no heavy cream so I added some half and half with a small piece of cream cheese.  I did't want to add sour cream because I thought it might change the flavor too much.  I did like this very much and so did my husband.

My family enjoyed this dish but I was a little disappointed. With all the good reviews I expected a better flavour, but found it lacking and a bit dull.  Will make again but add more spices.

Delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of using only 1/2 cup heavy cream. Served with cumin rice for an authentic meal.

I followed the recipe completely, minus the turmeric since we didn't have any, and I added a bit more cayenne pepper since we like spice. It turned out amazing! My husband loves it and he's a pretty picky eater :)

Very good!  This was my first attempt at an Indian dish and it turned out very well.  The smell of the spices heating in the pan with the onion was AMAZING!  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of cayenne and next time I'll decrease it even more - too spicy for my palate, but I'm more of a wimp than many when it comes to heat. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last week exactly as written and we loved it. I made it again this week, and the only thing I changed was to DOUBLE everything so that I could freeze a batch for next week! This is PERFECT!!! 

It makes step #1 easier to have all of your spices measured out before you ever start cooking the onion.

This is an amazing recipe!! I love it and would make it every week if I didn't think I would probably get tired of it eventually, which would be awful. I do make it AT LEAST once a month. It is an apartment favorite with my roommates. I cut back a little on the cayenne, 3/4 tsp seems to be the happy medium. (Although when making for family I cut it to 1/2 tsp) It is a little time consuming, but it's so worth it. Even my vegetarian friend loves this recipe, although she substituted tempeh for the chicken.
***EDIT*** I have started to be a little more conscious about my food choices and eating healthier. I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy this recipe as often (ever again) but I can!!! Substituted Greek yogurt for the heavy cream and it was still amazingly delicious and a little easier on my nutrition plan.

I made this today and, man oh man, it knocked my socks off!! Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe EXACTLY...did not change one ingredient at all. This is the best curry chicken recipe I have ever tried. Thank you, Chris, for this scrumptious recipe.

Finally! I have tried dozens of chicken tikka masala recipes, all of them promising to taste "just like what you'd get at a restaurant", and none of them coming close. This is the closest one I have ever found, and it's very close indeed! Didn't change a thing; it was perfect first time out. I'll be making this many, many times in the future.

We aren't Indian food eaters at home (I've only eaten Indian food once before) but my bff sent us a spice jar of curry that I felt obligated to use. This was our second dish and boy, it was superb! The only deviation I made from the recipe was using butter instead of ghee. 

A couple things...it was almost too creamy. Next time I'll cut back on the whipping cream, reduce to 2/3 c. I served it over fried rice with 1 t curry added in and a drizzle of fresh lime juice. That added a zing to cut the creaminess. It could have used some fresh greens. A previous reviewer mentioned serving with cilantro - that's on my radar for next time! Maybe some red pepper as well.

Thank you!

One of my families favourite recipes. We serve it with couscous and there is never any complaints about it. 

This is definitely one the few 6-star recipes on this site.

Can't go wrong with this recipe, many thanks for sharing it!

Rich, interesting flavours blend together beautifully in this dish. Even replacing cream with almond milk yielded a thick, smooth sauce.

This recipe is delicious and great for doubling and feeding large parties (or saving / freezing leftovers). The flavor is rich and savory -- everyone seems to like it, even my 4 year old. And it's naturally gluten-free! 

I make it exactly as the recipe describes, only I use regular butter instead of ghee and sometimes substitute the heavy whipping cream with half and half if I'm out of the former (still turns out great).

This dish(as a whole, including chicken, or just the sauce) freezes very well.

Loved it.  Didn't clarify the butter (lazy) and had to cut the cayenne in half so it wasn't too spicey for our taste.  I plan to make plenty of this sauce to keep in the freezer. My husband had it with tofu and I had it chicken.  Basmati rice made this a lovely meal.

Great recipe for the sauce, but for a more traditional (i.e., less easy) tikka masala you should really marinate the chicken in yogurt, curry powder and lemon for 1 hour to 1 day.  You can then brown the chicken under a broiler before adding to the curry sauce.  Came out astoundingly tasty, but don't forget to adjust to taste!  None of these recipes is the "correct" way of making this dish so do whatever pleases your tongue.

I agree with another review, spices need adjusting for my family's taste, it is way too salty ! also too much cayenne pepper for me. I cut back on all the other spices, I cant imagine using the full amounts it calls for. The flavor was good otherwise. Served with brown rice.

This is beyond good! I made a second batch of sauce to freeze. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. I finished it off in the slow cooker with the diced chicken and a drained can of chick peas. It melted in your mouth. It was so good I still can't believe it wasn't take away. Served it over rice like everyone else. No leftovers! It would also be good with some drained canned spinach stirred in. Delish!

Lovely. But I was wishing for MORE spices, if you can believe it.
I didn't want the heavy fat of the half and half, so I substituted for lowfat coconut milk and it was tangy and lovely. I would definitely do this one again!

I don't typically write reviews for things but have decided to after about the hundredth time making this recipe. This is THE best chicken tikka masala I have ever tried. I make this recipe exactly as written and serve it with Basmati rice and some Naan (recipe on this site http://allrecipes.com/recipe/naan/ ). I make this recipe at least once a month, and sometimes more. It's become a favorite in our house and really satisfies our craving for indian food. It's got a good amount of heat and an absolutely fantastic flavor. I recommend this recipe for anyone who has a weakness for indian food or wants to try something new.

Fantastic! I freeze large batches ahead for a quick meal and we eat it often. So much so that I started to worry about the fat content and now substitute a good thick coconut milk for the table cream. Thanks Chris for a killer recipe that is a real winner with guests and hubby!

Similar to our Indian restaurant.  I have discarded other recipes and for now will use this one.  I am pretty sure the heavy cream is a must.  I have inquired at several restaurants for this recipe... they all mention ground almonds and chicken marinated in yogurt. I might tweek this next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this as stated and it competes with some I've had from local restaurants. I found that I enjoyed leftovers more as the sauce thickened quite a bit after refrigerating. The initial consistency was a little on the watery side for me ... Probably just needed some more simmering time.

This is a great recipe. Add or delete to your taste, but I love it as is. I also use it with chickpeas instead of chicken for a great vegetarian meal.

delicious! i made this recipe almost exactly as described, except i used margarine instead of ghee,  a tsp of garlic powder instead of minced fresh garlic, and because i don't care for onion i used only half of one and liquified it in a blender first. instead of pan grilling the chicken, i just chopped up the raw chicken and cooked it directly in the pot with the sauce, adding the curry powder into the sauce instead of the chicken, which made the chicken very tender and flavourful. served over fresh basmati rice with oven baked naan bread for dipping! great flavour to this recipe, and it refrigerates and freezes perfectly so its easy to stock up.

The year's worth of cream is horrifying, but the product is D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.  This stuff is like savory candy.  I made some naan alongside it (and some Ethiopian cabbage), and loved mopping it all up.  This is a treat.  

And in case it helps to know, I just picked up the cheapest tomato sauce I could find--Prego traditional style.  I also didn't bother with the ghee, and subbed in olive oil.

Fantastic.  My husband said  that it was the best (!) chicken tikka masala he's ever had...restaurant quality. Now I don't know about all that, but it was really really good. And so simple to make. I added a little less sugar than called for and only did 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper, as per other reviews. Glad I did, because it still had a pretty good kick! Awesome!

This was pretty good but I had JUST had chicken Tikka Masal from an authentic Indian restaurant and it wasn't AS good.  I wanted to compare the two.  I didn't use heavy cream (I used milk), which I am positive made a difference.  Even with the HC, I would say it would get 4 stars.  Good but not as good as other Indian recipes on here for sure.

OMG!  I love, love, love Tikka Masala and when I read the reviews, I figured that this was worth a try.  I am SO glad I did!  This recipe is so good and so similar to what I've gotten from several local Indian restaurants.  I have made this exactly as it is written and it was really good "as is".  Per the suggestions of others, I have used olive oil (instead of ghee), cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, and added another 1/2 cup of cream (actually, I added an additional 1/2 cup of half half because that's what I had in the frig!).  The result was slightly milder and creamier... but still really good!  This has become a weekly staple in our house!  Thank you SO much for sharing!!!

UPDATE 6/16/17
We continue to make this recipe at my house and continue to love it!  I have come across a life changing alteration!  With the addition of small children to our home, it was difficult to make this and watch it from step to step.  Sooo...  follow step 1 ("fry" the various spices), then dump everything else in a dutch oven or slow cooker, put it on low for about 2-2.5 hrs, and WALK AWAY.  Stir it every 40" or so...  Chicken comes out super tender and I really can't tell a difference in the taste.  I can safely walk away from it and go do other things.  No more watching, stirring, adding, etc...  FABULOUS!!

Fantastic recipe.  I used about half the cayenne because my kids don't like the heat.  It still had just enough kick to make me happy.  I also used half-and-half in place of the heavy cream to cut the fat down a bit.  Even with these changes, I thought this was one of the best Indian dishes I've ever made; and I make a lot!

First recipe I have ever reviewed.  This recipe was amazing exactly as is.  My husband said it was the best meal I have made yet and definitely competes with Indian restaurant cuisine.  Thank you, Chris, for making me look like the most brilliant chef ever.  This will definitely served when we have company that I want to impress!

This recipe was delicious! I am glad that I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut the cayenne pepper in half or I wouldn't have enjoyed eating this at all (it would have been way too spicy for my family and I). I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream and it was perfect. Those are the only changes I made. Will definitely make this again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

OMG - this is amazing.  I tried it once and the whole family INHALED it and asked for more.  I made up some of the spice mixture in its own jar so I don't have to measure out all the individual spices.  I serve it over turmeric rice.  I added some slivered almonds to the rice a couple times - I liked that - gave it a little more texture.  I keep thinking I'm going to be able to take leftovers to work for lunch, but there is never anything left over!!

My housemates and I were looking for something new and interesting to add to our dinner plans for the week, and I stumbled upon this recipe. I'm really glad we tried it! We put potatoes in with the chicken, and it was delicious. Plus, it wasn't half as difficult to make as I was worried it'd be!

This recipe is fantastic. The only reason I gave it 4 intead of 5 stars is because I made a few substitutions. Namely - coconut milk for cream, fresh minced ginger instead of ground (added with garlic).  With tomato sauce added a one chopped plum tomato for texture.  Big hit with family.  Will definitely make again -- thanks for this excellent submission!

It is pretty good but the spices need some adjustments. First of all, I think the tbsp of sugar is too much. Next time, I will omit first and then add to taste. Not enough curry powder. We added much more than the 1/2 tsp called for to taste. Overall still tasty but adjust the seasonings to your own taste.

I'm not the best cook, so when I tried this recipe, my husband was a bit hesitant.  His favorite dish from the local Indian restaurant is chicken masala, so he thought I would destroy it.  With his first bite, he lit up and shocked me, "this is the best meal you have ever made."  what!?!  My only changes were using unsalted butter rather than ghee, a 15oz can of tomato sauce (instead of 14), olive oil instead of veggie oil, and more garlic (unsure of exact amount). Excellent recipe - and I think the kicker is the curry powder on the chicken before adding it to the sauce.  delicious!

Did you ever make food so good that you couldn't wait until the next day when you could eat it again? 

That's what this recipe is.

That said, I typically use fresh ginger and it still turns out wonderfully. I also end up adding a bit of sugar at the end, followed with a bit of salt to balance it out. (Taste taste taste... sugar to bring out the flavor, salt to balance the sugar.)

It's... amazing. Just the right amount of heat to make your mouth feel it, but not too much that you can't wash it out with a nice sip of water.

This was awesome.  My 1st try at an Indian dish and this is definitely a keeper.  It was as good as any restaurant.

Variances from this recipe:  
My chicken was already cooked so I put the curry in with the other spices and stirred the chicken in long enough to get it hot.  
Also, my wife is on a diet so I substituted Coconut Oil for Ghee and 1/2 teaspoon Agave for the sugar.  
I like spicy so I doubled the cayenne pepper.

I may try it with 1/2 and 1/2 next time to lower the fat content.  

Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe. It’s so delicious.  The only thing I changed was I put half the amount of paprika the recipe called for.

As an Indian, this is so good that it makes me mad haha! I was a bit skeptical because it was different from the tikka masala I typically make in terms of ingredients (I did add a few extra things but it’s not necessary). However, the flavor is delicious, I added around 1/2-1 tsp of sugar and added garam masala in place of the curry powder as I didn’t have any. I now make this around once a month, typically with paneer or chicken.

Since I am from Pakistan, I cook more authentic food (spicier, no cream, etc). CTMasala is a British dish borrowed from India and tweaked to suit local taste. Now, my kids love this dish at the Indian restaurants here and asked me to make it. It was a total hit!!! This recipe is very good. I added ground coriander, nutmeg and mace. Also to make more gravy (my kids can drink this stuff!) I added 1 cup milk. Very tasty and a real keeper! The aftertaste just lingers on and leaves a satisfied feeling!

I’ve made this, years ago, but now prefer chicken thighs in dishes, so just curious as to what you think 4 boneless skinless chicken boobs equate to in boneless skinless chicken thighs. I find the thighs moister and more flavorful. Want to try this again,  so a good ratio?

My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  It's not exactly like our favorite restaurant mild tikka masala.  But, it is very tasty and easy to make.  I like one pan cooking.  So, I cooked the chicken first and scooped it out to cook the sauce.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and still thought I would have liked a lot more to smother the riced cauliflower.  Next time.  I halved the amount of cayenne and it was still plenty spicy.  I realized I ran out of paprika.  But we didn't miss it.  We are saving this recipe to make again!

4.5 stars.  Made it dairy free by substituting coconut oil for ghee and coconut milk for cream.  Spiciness was just right.

Loved this recipe.  Touch of heat, favorful and nice feel in the mouth.  Plated just like the photo and everything went well together.  Definitely add this to repeat recipes.  Didn't vary from the ingredients and it worked for us.

Excellent. I doubled the cayanne (so, I used 2 tsp instead of 1). I did not use ghee, just butter. This recipe goes directly into my favorites.

Third time making it, still a huge hit. Only changes are to reduce cumin to 2 tsp, cayenne to 1/2 tsp, to get the right amount of heat for my crew. Make it and enjoy!

Made it exactly except for sugar. I added red peppers for the final 7 minutes. Served with jasmine rice and naan bread. Delicious! Even my boys loved it. A bit spicy 3 out of 5 for spicy-ness.

Fantastic taste and lucky for me I had all the spices in my spice rack!  Very easy and I’ve made this with even canned chicken Breast for a faster meal. Also I don’t bother clarifying the butter and it’s just as good.

I've tried a lot of curry recipes on this site and this one is by far the best one I've made. I cut down the sugar a little and the cinnamon to a pinch for personal reasons otherwise I the recipe. I think I'll be tossing the other recipes and using this one from now on. Thanks for this one !

I think it was a good simple recipe. I had most of the ingredients minus the paprika or milk. I didn't have milk or cream so I had used some ranch dressing and it tasted good. I will try this again and hopefully have all the right ingredients and make it cotrectly.

I made this exactly how the recipe is written, leaving out only the cayenne because I don’t like spice.  Really is soooo good.  Better than anything I have bought at restaurants.

I'm new to the kitchen. At 37 I've decided to step up and cook for my family of 8, 3 days/wk. This is one of the meals I chose this week. IT WAS AMAZING! My wife only loves one Indian dish and it's from a restaurant 1hr and a half away from home. She was thrilled about this one though. Our kids liked it too. Thanks!

I made this and found it to be an easy, authentic "UK " Tikka Masala.

Closest to Indian restaurant I’ve ever gotten! I read a review that said to add 1tsp garam masala and 1tsp ground coriander, highly recommend!

I make this A LOT. Addictive! Just reduce the cayenne pepper by half (or more) if you’re making it for kids. Goes great with riced cauliflower if you’re keto or low carb!

Yummy! Only changes are I added a couple of tablespoons more of unsalted butter (didn’t have cheese) and used half and half that I had on hand instead of heavy cream.

This was the first Indian dish I’ve ever made, and I sit here writing this with a full belly after having made (and eaten) it again at my family’s insistence. They LOVE this recipe! I love it too. I leave out the hot stuff so the kids will eat it. I serve it with rice and roasted Brussels sprouts and it is amazing. Do yourself a favor and pre-mix the ingredients where you can, and have the chicken cut and ready to go. Much less stress.

Excellent recipe.  Definitely double the cayenne and in the first spice combination.  Also, to make this 6 star, use a stainless steel pan to seer the chicken, de-glaze with chicken broth,  THEN pour into the rest of your stew.

Holy  this was good. Granted the only Tika masala I had before was frozen entree from Speouts, but this came out so good. I was concerned about using a bunch of spices I'd never cooked with before like tumeric and curry but this came out so fricken delicious. I used the pre cooked shredded rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and added see brown sugar in addition to the white sugar. I never review recipies but felt compelled to let people know how good this tastes. There's a reason it's at 4.5 stars with 2k reviews. MAKE IT !

This was better than I've ever had it out.  I really liked that, because I made it, I could adjust the level of heat to my liking.  I have to admit that while I was making it, I had my reservations but as it cooked and I went through the steps, I had a feeling it was going to be good.  And boy was it!!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe is seriously amazing. I have been making this recipe for well over 7 years, so that alone says a lot about the staying power of the recipe. Like most people who love Indian foods, I have my favorite restaurant, but there is something special about the smell of the blend of spices, wafting throughout your home, that adds to the enjoyment of making it yourself. 

I urge you to please make it without any substitutions or changes the first time you make it, with the exception of adjusting cayenne for heat possibly. The recipe on its own is wonderful. This is the recipe that made my husband, who had never had it before, love Indian food, so for that fact I am incredibly grateful. 

After the first time, go nuts and tweak it to suit you and your flavors. I make several adjustments, after so many years of making this recipe. I use about 2-3 more cloves of garlic and use fresh ginger, which I add in with the garlic. Half the cayenne, because that's about all my husband can do. I don't use tomato sauce, and instead use 2 cans of crushed/diced tomatoes, which I blend thoroughly. And depending on how much time I have, I will marinate the chicken, adding a heaping spoonful or two of yogurt to the curry, which I double, and always adding a teaspoon of garam masala to my chicken. The end result is divine.

I also always urge doubling the recipe, as leftovers, like most Indian food, taste even better on day two. And as others have said, the sauce freezes wonderfully and is easil

I made as written, much better flavor than recipe I have been using. not much experience eating Indian food so I'm not critiquing authenticity. I am only saying that it was easy to make, didn't take a lot of time, ingredients, or make a big mess in the kitchen... and we enjoyed the results.

Loved this recipe. It is almost identical to the Tikka I get at my favorite Indian restaurant. I can't help but tweak all the recipes I use. In this recipe I marinated chicken thighs with the curry and ginger and added some greek yogurt. I also added garam masala to the sauce, about 1 tsp. Some extra bay leaves and a cinnamon stick. I also used tomato paste and chicken broth instead of tomato sauce. I added the cooked chicken and simmered the sauce for 30 minutes to reduce it a bit and thicken the sauce. Even though I tweaked it for my tastes this is a wonderful recipe! We served it over quinoa with homemade naan bread. Delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I made it pretty much as directed.  I served it with basmati rice pilaf.  It lasted a couple of meals and we weren't tired of it!  I'd like to kick up the heat a bit next time, will experiment with that.

I have made this recipe numerous times now and it was very delicious as usual. The only adjustment I made was I added some white wine vinegar as I found the sauce a bit sweet, and this definitely helped even out some of the sweetness.

It turned out well. I made a few  substitutions with the spices. I used smoked paprika, and it would have been better with regular paprika. I also skipped the sugar and cinnamon and was happy with how it turned out without those.

This is one of the best recipes for chicken curry.  Relatively low carb and delicious.
After many attempts at other recipes and  also using prepared jars of curry sauce, I have finally found a recipe that is a keeper!
I made it with no alterations and served it over cauliflower rice with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and plain yogurt. 
Naan bread is a nice addition if you are not watching your carbs.
Thank you for the great recipe.

My family loved this recipe!!! This is the second time I’m making it...it’s on the stove now just waiting for the chicken to finish in the sauce. I used frozen breasts the first time, because it’s what I had on hand. I rubbed them with some oil then the curry and popped them in the oven and cooked according to the package instructions...about 45 minutes, let them rest for 10, chunked them up then added to the sauce for maybe 10 minutes. Today, I used fresh and made per the recipe. Care to guess which method of chicken prep I preferred?...spoiler...oven, hands down. Putting it in the oven gave me plenty of time to prep the sauce...yeah, I’m not super fast at prepping veggies, and I spent about 10 minutes searching for the curry powder that was literally right in front of me.  I also used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes today. I will say, that I do like the consistency. I’m also planning on throwing in some peas at the end. It smells absolutely amazing. I also used 1/2 of cream, and some bone broth, because no one, namely me, eating it today needs the calories.  I’m having fun with this recipe! You should too:)

Finally, a perfect Tikka Masala recipe! I substituted olive oil for ghee (which I can’t ever find) and it was perfect. A little on the spicy side for the kids, but tolerable enough that they finished their helpings without too much complaining. Perfect on the spicyness for my wife and I.

Love this recipe. Make it quite frequently for my friends and family and they think its dope. Tilapia or shrimp goes well instead of chicken. Add some peas for a bit of color if you don't like cilantro.

Indian is one of my favorite cuisines and the mystery of it makes it even better. The bf loved this, and I will be making enormous pots of this with a few more veggies thrown in (carrots, cauliflower, etc) bec/ it makes a complete meal. Thankfully we will soon be in winter and recipes like this will be a treat. Thank you!

LOVED THIS! I'm vegan and have tried making vegan tikka masala recipes by other food bloggers, but they are always disappointing. I decided to modify this recipe instead and it came out perfect. I subbed full fat coconut milk for cream, olive oil for ghee, and cauliflower for chicken. I also added about 1/2 tablespoon of jalapeno with the garlic. Another reviewer recommended 1 teaspoon of garam masala and 1 teaspoon of coriander and I agree these are a great addition. I did about 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce as well. This will be a staple in my hone!!

I have made this recipe countless times. I make a chicken version for my kids and my husband and I use chickpeas and cauliflower in place of chicken. It is one of our favorite recipes. I use butter instead of ghee and half coconut milk/ half heavy cream and it’s so luscious. Give it a try!!!

Wow!  This was so easy and delicious!!  I actually used all the meat that I pulled from a Rotisserie Chicken (tossing that in the curry powder prior to putting it into the sauce).  With busy after school schedules, I love a delicious meal that you can use a shortcut like this. Husband and 2 teens inhaled it!!!  Will definately make again!!!

This has become a regular meal in our house, especially after moving to a place with not so many Indian options. The directions sounded complicated at first but are really quite simple. I cannot say enough good things about this and I get compliments all the time!

Delicious! I actually followed the recipe exactly on this one (usually I read a few similar recipes and make my own choices based on that and reviews) and this turned out fantastic! I measured out all the spices ahead of time in a smaller bowl so I could add them all in at the same time. I also cooked the chicken breasts while I was letting the sauce simmer.

To tasty! I really impressed both myself and my boyfriend and I will definitely be making it again!

Great recipe!  Easy to follow for a newbie like me. 
I made it twice, one with heavy cream and add more coconut milk at the end to get more sauce,  second time I substitute heavy milk for coconut milk.  I prefer heavy cream for this recipe.

Made it twice in three days. Loved it both times (I used less sugar/Cayenne pepper and added peas the second time). Also, I'm a college student and it tastes just as good reheated the next day.

I love this sauce, have made it over and over again.  Make it just as the recipe says for the sauce.  I do marinate the chicken in yoghurt overnight as I sometimes find the breasts get tough.

I'm now making batches of the sauce for the freezer as it freezes so well and then I can just add the chicken and curry when I need a batch.

I made an account just to comment on this. It's almost perfect. I made it as directed with the sugar. It's quite rich and was good immediately and as leftovers. I normally don't like tomato based recipes on the first day but this one was so well spiced that it was nicely balanced. I served it over coconut rice with a side of asparagus and it's the best meal I've had in a week. Next time I would cut the cinnamon a little because I think it can over power that delicious curry aroma, and maybe I would bump the heat. I like my curries spicy. But this recipe was perfect for even my friends who are sensitive to heat. Be sure to properly thicken the sauce so it clings to the chicken and doesn't get wasted on your plate.

This was SO DELICIOUS!  To cut down on calories, I used Half & Half instead of Heavy Whipping Cream and served it over "riced" cauliflower and some green peas.
NOTE: The recipe tells you to add chicken to pan over medium heat and sear (about 3 minutes)  There is no way the chicken is going to sear over medium heat in 3 min.  I put my pan over high heat to sear the chicken pieces.

I've been cooking this for years and it has become my go to recipe if I want to impress someone. Couple personal tips: you can radically improve the flavor by mincing up whole ginger and tumeric root (instead of using pre-ground). I'll also sometimes grind up cumin seed, and using coconut milk can be a nice dairy free variation.

Love this recipe!  To be honest, I’ve never had this dish before I made it so this review is based purely on my own selfish and egotistical views.  I usually make with chicken and use full fat cream but tonight I spiced things up and used super for tofu and coconut milk.  I seasoned my tofu with curry powder like in the recipe and used ghee likes it recommends.  It smells amazing and I’m excited to try it

This was a hit with the entire family. I would say my chicken was a bit over cooked.  I think browning it less and cooking it in the sauce would make it less dry.
But OMG- the sauce is so wonderful I am going to make several batches, freeze it and use with other meals, including pork chops.

WOW!  that's what everyone at the table said when I served this!   Definitely a hit at my house!  I served it with Chef John's home made naan that I made just before I started the Tikka Masala and kept warm in the oven.   This recipe is a keeper!

I find this a fantastic curry recipe that friends all ask for when we are travelling. I add some peas and tweak the heat a bit depending on the audience. Definitely add more curry (2T Madras) to the chicken when I fried it up. No leftovers!!

I've tried like 10 recipes for tikka masala sauce to put chicken or paneer in and this isn't just the best, it's the only one that's been any good at all. I have yet to try all the other top ones on this site but I can endorse this one without reservation.

I've made this several times now.  Love it, the family loves it, and the kids are always saying YAY when they know I'm making it!  I do have to tone down the cayenne for the kids, but that's all I change so the kids will chow down!  I did some very minor research and found that a lot of people added frozen peas as a veggie part.  It works GREAT with this incredible recipe!  Thanks for posting it for everyone to enjoy!

Pretty good. Not as tangy as I like it when I eat at authentic Indian restaurants though. I believe vinegar is typically used and the chicken is usually marinated in yogurt before being seared. Decent base recipe

Amazing we had it for dinner and for lunch for days, just wish there was more and more. Its got a little bit of warmth to it but not so mich that you need a gallon of milk.  May add peas and potatoes next time just for fun! This is for sure going on my list of foods to make again and again.

Wow! So delicious! And my kids love it, too. I cubed the chicken, seasoned with curry, and marinated in buttermilk overnight. Then just followed the recipe. Comes out perfect every time.

Very good, I've made this a handful of times.  I'm never one for measuring stuff but otherwise, have followed the directions exactly.  A few recommendations.  No need to brown the chicken and then add mostly raw chicken to the sauce to cook for 30 minutes.  I'll usually cook the chicken all the way through and then dump it in.  I also like adding a can of diced tomatoes to give the sauce a bit more substance.  I have also tried replacing the cream with a can of coconut milk which worked out well.

This recipe is amazing! I am vegan and since I have to alter most recipes, I rarely review them. However, I followed this recipe very closely, only substituting coconut milk (for heavy cream) and Tofu/Chickpeas (for the chicken) to make it vegan friendly. I absolutely agree with all the other reviewers. This is a fantastic recipe. I can only imagine how much better it would be as written. I will have to follow complete recipe one day for my non-vegan family. I'm truly excited to make this part of my dinner rotation!!!! I did not find it time consuming, but I usually have all ingredients measured and chopped before I begin the assembly. I do agree that you should make this the 1 day before you plan to serve as the flavors do "pop" after blending for a day!

Yep this is lick the bowl Delish.  I mistakenly added ALL spices to a premade mix I did a day ahead and also marinated the chicken in cumin for the  night ...and didn't measure exact...and didn't seem to matter?  I will make again and see how much of a difference it would make.  I love spicy so more is okay by me.  Had this  with a Cucumber Raita (whipped up from recipe here...and didn't marinate for 3 hours either) and Trader Joes' chutney. .  Now..Bring on the comfort sweat pants and the couch.  I am fat and happy.   I'd also like to try the "skinny" version of this that someone posted.  This recipe, as is...could be Dangerous!

I would recommend less sugar and a good shake of garam masala (and a smidge less cream based of preference). Besides that, this tastes exactly like my neighborhood Indian restaurant’s tikka masala sauce.

I have made this so many times--it is delicious. The sauce is GREAT to freeze. Just double up the sauce recipe, set aside half to cool, bag, and freeze. Add the chicken to the rest of the sauce that's still on the stove as the recipe calls for. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a go-to meal when I want to make the whole family happy.

Absolutely fantastic! I add 1 tsp. of curry powder to the masala sauce, as well as adding it to the chicken while it sears. I also will add 1-2 tsp. of garam masala spice to the masala sauce to give it just an extra bit of flavour. If you don't like spicy food, leave out the cayenne - you won't be disappointed.

Top notch! My hubby and girls all raved about how tasty this was. I did a couple of short cuts since it’s a week/work night. I sautéd the onion, garlic in olive oil and added curry Powder that I pre-made a few months ago with my mum who makes it in bulk to keep in the freezer. Anyway, I’m sure any curry powder would work? My curry powder has identical ingredients so thought I would try it. I sautéd onion and garlic, added the curry powder sautéd a bit and then continued with the recipe adding a can of premium chicken breast. Heated through and proceeded with cream. I served over rice along with poppadoms. I’ve already been requested to save this dish as a favorite to fix again and I agree.

Made this last night for a dinner with friends and it was great! I followed the recipe as is with the exception of using chicken thighs vs. breasts. In the future I would marinate the chicken beforehand and perhaps add more cream/tomato sauce as there wasn't much extra sauce left over, but the taste was excellent.

This recipe is out of the world amazing! We've eaten it three times in the last week and a half. My new favorite comfort food.  I did half the amount of cayenne since I have whimpy taste buds.

I used chickpeas and lentils instead of chicken and thickened it with cornflour (otherwise was way too thin and i didnt have time to stand over the stove reducing it) amazing flavours, 5 stars, will make again with chicken.

I made this Vegan by substituting the Chicken with Tofu, and the Salt with 1 Tbsp Veggie Boullion. At first I felt like it was missing something (a spice, not sure which one). But after it sat in the freezer over night it tasted really good. Its not my absolute favorite but I'm sure I will make it again. Oh, and before I made it I thought the cayenne might be too much, but it turns out it was the perfect amount for me.

I loved the smell and taste of this dish. My family loved it too. I used some half and half because I had it and needed to use it before it spoiled. I was concerned about the cayenne pepper so I sprinkled heavily but I feel like it was less than  a teaspoon. It was perfect amount of heat.  I served it aromatic jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Totally forgot I had pita bread which would have been great to sop up the yummy, flavorful cream. Will make again!

Added some garam masala like another reviewer recommended, and some extra cream (since we don't like a lot of heat, we didn't add any extra cayenne).  Served with rice and naan - will be making again! 
The 4 stars is because we did make changes and I feel like they enhanced the original recipe.

Love this dish. I add some red pepper flakes to add some spice, not much though, about an 1/8 tsp. Use butter instead of ghee for convenience as well, still amazing. Highly recommend. One of my favorite dishes I've found on AllRecipies

Made this on a whim the first time, and adjusted some things because I was missing a couple of ingredients. Left out the turmeric, increased the curry powder, cumin, and cayenne, didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I added a cup of plain yogurt instead. My man found it too hot but I thought it was perfect and thus had the whole batch for myself *insert evil laugh* Making it for the second time today and since my tinkering came out so yummy the first time I plan to do it the same way but double the batch and freeze it

4 stars overall for the ease of this recipe - so little prep, all I had to do was chop an onion!! Haven't had real tikka masala in forever; however I thought the paprika was just too much in this recipe- next time I'd add in half and do it at the beginning when the rest of the spices go in. Otherwise this was a great recipe!

FINALLY! This is what I crave when I crave chicken tikka masala. To date I have only tried "cooking" it with jarred simmer sauces at the store. But I don't bother with those anymore because the end result is never what I'm looking for. After trying this recipe I finally feel like I can add chicken tikka masala into my regular rotation at home! I followed the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing — not too difficult and the flavor was amazing.

There are just not enough over top words to express how much I love this recipe. I read and re-read the review comments and other than adding more curry powder I stick to the recipe. This must be the 10 th time I have made this and I am tweaking a little out of curiosity, not necessary. THANKS FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE!!

I modified the recipe a little bit and made it in the crock pot.  I'm making it again this week.  My son LOVED it!  he is begging for more.  I preferred it before I added the cream (I added it after I got home and turned the crock pot on high for twenty minutes after I added the cream and then served it with rice) but my son loved the cream.  It's very flavorful and was great with jasmine rice.

I made the recipe “as is” and LOVED IT!! My wife thought it was a little too spicy, but my son cannot get enough of it! Try it for yourself. We served it over 10 min. Rice and store bought Naan!

This was amazing.  I stuck to the recipe since I always like to see what was intended before I tweak if need be.  Won't be tweaking. The spices packed a punch (probably because I'm not much for measuring) and the taste was outstanding.  A truly authentic tasting meal.  I will make this again.  I will say I did use thighs instead of breasts because I find them to be more tender and juicer, but other then that no change. We loved it!

This is amazing!!  A bit on hot side (probably what I’d consider Indian mild) so I’ll reduce the amount of Cayenne Pepper next time.  My husband ate it over rice and didn’t think it was hot, I can’t eat rice so I wonder if the starch in the rice helps neutralize some of the heat.  I also added 1 tsp of Garam Masala w/ the curry sprinkled on the chicken as suggested by another user.  This is going to be a regular in our house!!

I could not eat it as it was too spicy for me,  however my son loved it! I actual made it for him knowing I am wimpy when it comes to spice. I use coconut oil because I didn't have the ghee. Would make it again!

Amazingly Delicious. Didn't add sugar, used about 1/2 tsp more curry powder for 4 sliced chicken breasts. Used Olive Oil instead of clarified butter and a whole large onion and extra garlic too at the start, can't go wrong.

This is SO good! Tastes just as good as my favorite Indian restaurant and it's so easy to make! I usually double the recipe (everything but the cayenne pepper) so we can have leftovers. It's one of my kids favorite meals.

This is a keeper! I didn't have an onion on hand so I used 1/2 container of French's fried onions leftover from Thanksgiving and tossed in some dried onions from the pantry for good measure. Didn't have a 14 ounce can of tomato sauce so used two smaller 8oz ones. Also, used half the cayenne just because I'm not a fan of heat and it had the perfect zing to it. Family loved it (even picky 6 year old!) Served it with sides of fresh pineapple and couscous. Will make again and again and again.

My family loves this recipe! It’s totally authentic and full of flavor. I made a few changes to increase the sauce volume (my kids love lots of sauce over their basmati rice). Instead of 1 cup cream, I do 1 part cream and 2 parts full fat coconut milk (1 1/2 cups total). I also add a teaspoon of homemade Garam Masala spice as recommended by one of the other reviewers. Delicious!

My family enjoyed this. I used boneless, skinless thigh meat which stays tender and juicy. I look forward to making it again. I served it with steamed rice and Trader Joe's Garlic Naan (freezer case) slathered with melted butter.

Wow I loved it, it wasn’t too spicy hot but had great flavor.  My spouse got up and took seconds which is very rare.  That alone is a big deal, then I was told save the recipe.

didn't have yoghurt or cream so used coconut milk. Not the flavour I was looking for and there is not enough sauce. Won't make it again.

This is great, and a new family staple.  You can customize as other reviews note:   I’ve substitute the cream for everyday use (I still use it for “fancy”company).  I use milk, skim or whole... I’ve tried yogurt but it changed the taste too much. I add some steamed cauliflower or carrots or parsnips or garbanzo beans.  Basmati rice and naan ( Allrecipes recipe).    It’s better than restaurant food!

Decided to make this on the spur of the moment. Had most of the ingredients. Substituted coconut cream for whipping cream, red onion for white, minced garlic for fresh and stevia for sugar. Also used leftover chicken, shredded. Upped the cayenne by 50%, cause I like the heat. 

Turned out quite yummy. I will very likely try it again with the specified ingredients.

Served over steamed, riced cauliflower with green peas on the side. Too bad I didn't have some garlic naan bread to go with it.

So good but so spicy!!!! I thought 1 tbls of cumin seemed like a lot and it was. I added yogurt to cut down the heat and it helped. I will certainly make it again but next time I’ll cut the cumin in half.

This turned out amazing. I always try to make the recipes exactly as described. Otherwise, there's no point leaving a review. I made it almost exactly as described. I didn't want to buy ghee, since I don't often make these kinds of dishes. Instead, I used Sesame oil, which worked well for sauteing the onion/garlic. I heated up some garlic Naan bread and Basmati rice to go with it, and it was excellent. Will definitely make it again!

Amazing!  I have found something all the people in my family adore!   I even found this recipe easy to adapt to a pressure cooker.  I chopped and cooked the chicken in pressure cooker for 10 min first, poured off the juices, stir-fried the seasonings and onion separately, then added those with the tomato sauce and cream to chicken in cooker, pressure cooked for another 10 min.  Served with rice.

Thanks to this meal, I transformed into someone who likes to cook and everyone thinks I'm this amazing chef now.  And I'm not kidding! My family went NUTS over this dinner like never before.  I'm making it tomorrow night and everyone is thrilled, including me because I get nonstop accolades.  Don't need to change anything to recipe, but do suggest that you not rush the simmering time.  Was just as delicious the next day, too!  Best.recipe.ever.

This recipient was delicious. It was a little sweet for me at first, but the spices married nicely with the leftovers and it was fantastic! My whole family loved it. I served it over white rice with naan . I didn't make any changes to it and thought it was great.

I used cheese curds instead of chicken, and 2% milk instead of cream.  I had some garam so added some just a few minutes before serving.  I've never made masala or used curds.  It turned out to be masala cheese sauce.  Haha.  Tasted awesome, tho!

With the exception of using fresh (well, frozen, really) ginger instead of the powdered variety, and maybe using rounded measurements, I followed this recipe as written.

There's a reason for its high rating; this is fantastic out of the pan. I suspect with a few days' refrigeration, it'll be spectacular

I will definitely make this again. My husband and I both give it 5 Stars. 
I pretty much made the recipe as written, but I used boneless chicken thighs because that is what I had. I also substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream and coconut sugar for the white sugar.
Everything else was the same. I served it over riced cauliflower. It was a great, grain free meal!

Do this in one pan by starting with searing chicken.  Then set aside chicken and otherwise follow recipe.   Cut out cinnamon and use only 1/4 tsp cayenne due to family preferences.

I took chicken thighs and sprinkled half of the seasoning on them and browned them in a sauté pan. I cooked them bone and all and deboned them after cooking . It was delicious. My boss is Indian and I brought it in for her and her family. They were quite impressed. I will be making this again .

Not as good as restaurant, but decent.  Why is there so much cream?  If that is the traditional way, I am definitely going to lessen my trips to eat Indian food, eek!

I made as instructed with only exception using butter instead of ghee, as that is what I had.  Spices as listed made it plenty warm for me without adding extra pepper.  I thought this was easy to make & really enjoyed the flavor!

SO good and easy to make! I originally found this in the AllRecipes magazine and another user said they used regular butter. I did the same and it turned out fantastic. My whole family loved it and all the ingredients were easy to find. I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely amazing. I prepped some of the ingredients ahead of time and it was so easy. It ended up being a little too sweet for me so I added some apple cider vinegar to increase the spice and decrease the sweetness.

I made this exactly to recipe, except I mistakenly got diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I was a little worried but it turned out great. Not sure I’d want to chance making it with sauce next time because it was so darn good this way.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was easy and not especially time consuming. The most time consuming part was measuring out all the spices, but that can be done in advance if needed. 

This was my first try at making Indian food from scratch (I've used store-bought simmer sauces before). It was super fun. I made this, a curry shrimp dish, basmati rice and served naan on the side. 

My entire family loved it!  We are not  of Indian heritage, so can't say how authentic it tastes, but compared to Indian restaurants I've eaten at in the US, it is comparable. My family all agreed that this is a must-repeat! 

Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.

This is the first Indian dish I have attempted to make. It was very easy to cook and turned out delicious.

I left out the ghee and cream per recommendations my Indian coworkers gave me.

amazing recipe, my husband and I love this dish and always order this when eating out at Indian restaurants. loved recreating it, although we did do some changes. 

-instead of chicken we used paneer. I lightly fried cube shaped paneer pieces with MDH curry butter chicken masala, red chilli powder, salt, and garam masala. then added it to the sauce and simmered for about 10 mins

-i used a ginger and garlic minced paste half tablespoon 
-added 1 teaspoon curry powder to sauce

-only added 1 teaspoon sugar instead of 1 tablespoon 
-added green bell peppers to sauce 

Served with rice, garlic naan, and mango lassi ??

I cooked the chicken in the instapot in 1.5 cups of sauce for 25m...turned out delicious. 

1.5 tsp of cayenne - good medium  heat . Maybe try 1tsp next time. 

I also seasoned the chicken in my vindaloo spice before I sauteed the chicken in the instapot.

A great recipe! It reminded me quite a bit of the Chicken Tikka Masala they serve at India Palace.  It does take a little while to make, but it's totally worth it.  I like to double the recipe so that there are leftovers, and it does freeze well too.

Amazing!!! So delicious and straightforward AND using standard kitchen ingredients. I can't wait to make it again! I doubled the recipe and it fed 7 adults and two children. I was hoping for leftovers. Triple batch next time. I added 2 tsp of garam masala and subbed red pepper flakes for cayenne. Didn't have tomato sauce so I blended up a can of diced tomatoes, worked perfectly. YUM!

I used butter instead of ghee and accidentally used a full teaspoon of all the spices in the first part of the recipe because I was in a hurry and it still tasted great! I was impressed. I usually don't cook Indian food but, was glad I tried this recipe and will make it again. It is kind of spicy but, in a good way.

We were looking for something different and this recipe definitely did the trick.  Neither one of us had ever had Indian food, so this was the first time.  It has some heat, which we liked.  I would make it again.  Ill bet its even better the 2nd day.

This dish is delicious. I added considerable more curry powder to the chicken and lots more cayenne and seasoning and it was delicious. I served it with basmati rice, naan bread, and a garden salad. My husband loved it.

I absolutely love this recipe!! The flavor is outstanding. I followed the sauce to a T. I did however use a different recipe when it came to marinading the chicken (more spices, yogurt and 2 hours).

Wow! Perfect as written. This was amazing. We paired it with some naan & my boyfriend literally wiped the bowl clean with the bread! Definitely will make this again!

This is the one!....if You haven't made this yet , this is the tikka your looking for....the only note I have after making this many, many times is the balance of the ingredients is important especially the tomato to cream ratio....( that being said...I admit I have taken to adding a bit of extra curry powder, with the spices...)

So good!!!  To not dirty an additional pan I make the chicken first in the pan set aside and then start the recipe.  The spice mixture and toasting it adds to the flavor.  I up the cayenne for spice.  I have been making this for years and everyone loves it.  Also great left overs!  I serve with naan, basmati rice, and a light green salad!

My household doesn't like too much hot spice so I dropped the cayenne to a 1/4 tsp instead of the full teaspoon. I was still amazing. Will definitely make this again.

I made this and my family absolutely loved it! I love this from Indian Restaurants. I must brag and say, it tasted like or better than the restaurant. Only modification I made was I marinated the chicken overnight in curry, black pepper, salt, and lemon juice. I will be using this recipe frequently..

I ended up adding about a 1/2 c of cream so that my husband would enjoy it, too.   It was perfect as is (before the cream), but I knew it might be too hot for him.  It was still delicious and still had a bite to it.  I will definitely make this again!   I am planning making it for company as well.

I've made this a few times and my family absolutely loves this recipe.  I always need to double the recipe so we have leftovers.  It's also a little bit time consuming, given our busy schedules, so it's the perfect Sunday night meal.  I made as written the first time and love it so much, I've not revised the recipe at all.  Thank you for such a great combination of flavors!

This  recipe was awesome.  I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious.  It was a bit on the spicy side for  some of the family (not me!). If there are tender mouths, you may want to adjust the cayenne.  I would try it as is though.  Perfect!

I made this and everyone in the family loved it! Easy recipe to follow and no crazy ingredients. I didn’t have ghee so I cooked the butter a bit and it was yummy. I would add more cayenne if you like it spicy. My only issue is that I didn’t double the recipe. ??

Delicious! Made as stated except I used half n half since I did not have heavy cream. I followed the directions cooking the chicken exactly as stated and it came out moist and tender unlike some recipes that can turn out over cooked. Great combination/amount of spices. I had leftovers for two days!

Perfect as is without sugar! But I love it with 2 chicken breasts and large can of smashed chick peas. Unfortunately too spicy for my 15 year old son. My new favorite!!!! (Note to self: cook chicken first then set aside in bowl THEN make the sauce in same pan. Do not cook chicken with sauce or it gets chewy.)

Tweaked it to my preferred taste but an awesome recipe as is. A little less cream, a dash of coconut milk, some extra curry, and I also only had about 2 tsp of cumin  but it turned out so great. Will def make again and again. Maybe add some Garam Masala. Don’t forget the fresh cilantro :)

I was in the mood to try an Indian recipe and this one turned out to be terrific.  I like to try recipes for the first time by following the directions exactly.  The only thing I altered was the amount of cayenne pepper since I have a low tolerance for heat.   I'll add more curry powder on the next round just to see how different the taste is.  Otherwise the rice and naan is ready!

This is wonderful!  Knowing that all of the spices are "good for you"  I really wanted to try it.  Fantastic!  the amount of cayenne was just right:  at first I thought a bit hot, but once served over rice, it was great.  Two tips:  I actually cooked the chicken in the pan first and then put it off to the side and did steps 1 and 2, so that way I only had one pan to wash.  And I put the 3 separate spice steps in bowls before I started cooking so I didn't have to stop and measure during the process.  I didn't need to add any additional optional salt or sugar.  Really... try this recipe!  It would probably be great with prawns, too.

I really liked this a lot. I used fat free creamer. But I think it would be better with some coconut milk too. Yum. I didn't have gee or even know what it was so I used some olive oil and butter.  I should have used some tomato paste too to make it thicker but no problem like this. My boyfriend doesn't like curry so next time when I make it I will cut way down on the curry. The boys thought it was pretty spicy. I did too but I liked it.  Also, 4 large chicken breasts is about 3 pounds and I used just under that. I will have to use more if everyone in my family of 5 will be eating it and we want leftovers.

I changed the ghee to 3 tbs of salted butter, as the store I was shopping at didn't stock ghee.  I also used a different pepper spice. Amazing dish! Would recommend this dish to anyone!

This was the perfect spice combination. Super authentic. I didn’t have heavy cream so I substituted it for 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. It was perfect...and added some natural sweetness where I didn’t add regular sugar. I just put a small squeeze of Agave nectar for balance.

This was very good but I would have liked it a little hotter so will add more spice next time. I used olive oil instead of ghee as I had none, and half and half instead of full cream,  therefore adding tomato paste for half of the tomato sauce to keep it thicker. Really enjoyed it

This is a delicious recipe, but I have to say it was WAY too hot for me with the 1 teas of cayenne. I had doubled the recipe and when I realized how hot it was, I ended up adding another 2 cans of tomato sauce and 2 cups of cream....In other words, I ended up with a QUADRUPLE recipe just to cool it off...and it's STILL really hot. Next time, I'm going to double the recipe and only put in a half teaspoon of cayenne! Otherwise, it is absolutely delicious.

Delicious! I've made many different Chicken Tikka Masala recipes and this comes the closest to tasting like a restaurant version.  The only thing I would change is using half the amount of cayenne.

This is the tikka masala base recipe I have been looking for!! The only thing it was missing, is coriander. I add a lot of coriander to it (at least 2 tsp, during onion saute), and it's great!

I took a chance, based on the reviews, and tripled the recipe so as to have some to freeze. I am so glad I did. I put all the spices in at once after sautéing the onions, garlic and fresh ginger. I simmered it for quite a while. I then added the cream and simmered some more. Oh, I doubled the cayenne because we like it warm. Cooked the chicken with curry, split the sauce into thirds, and added the chicken to one of the portions. All I have to do is cook some chicken and I will have 2 wonderful meals at a later date.  Serve it with warm Naan and yummy yummy yummy.

The first time I made this, I added a little extra curry because I love curry, but the curry flavor turned out too strong. This time around, i didn't change a thing, and even used measuring spoons for the spices. It came out perfect! Follow this recipe exactly as is, and if anything, cut out some of the cayenne if you dont have any heat tolerance

This is the best tikka masala recipe I've had yet, short of a pro making it overseas. Dare I say it: I might actually toss out my other versions and make this my go-to. We cut it in half for 2 people, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Cutting in half made it cook about 10 mins. faster than the recipe said it would (bonus!)  Even cutting in half, we had plenty of sauce to also coat some veg like cauliflower, potatoes or peas/snap peas (or leave out the meat and just do lots of veg).  Has a low-key "clear-the-sinuses" spice (as opposed to "makes-you-cry" spice), but if you're really sensitive to spice, you could cut the cayenne by 1/4 or 1/2 (don't get rid of it entirely, though, or you'll really lose something from the dish). I'm usually a "medium" spice person and I thought the amount as-written was just right -- enough to have a slight kick, but not so much that it drowns out the flavor of the dish.

I made this with leftover frozen turkey, and coconut cream instead of heavy dairy cream. Oh, and only a 1/4 tsp of cayenne, because I have a young one with sensitive tastebuds in the house. It's easy to add a little more for those of us who might want it spicier. Yummy stuff!

This was a great recipe, I started with the one in the magazine and then came here to save it so I could make it again.  Even the kids gobbled this up!  Added some peas at the end but the spice was just right for our small children!

I've made this three times now and it's definitely a new favorite in our household. The first time I accidentally omitted the cayenne and it was tasty but had no kick. The second time I did not and it was great but a little hot for my spice-sensitive partner. The third time I used half, and it was perfect.

Whatever your Goldilocks spice level, this is a deceptively easy recipe that delivers a delicious meal. Serve it with some rice, or naan, or both!

This is a good base recipe. 
I substituted the Heavy Cream with Yogurt, and adjusted the amount of spice used cause I thought it was too mild and it really elevated the curry.  I also added Cauliflower along with the chicken.

The only revision to this recipe that I made was to add half a head of cauliflower to simmer for those last 30 minutes; figured I could sneak in some veggies into the kids' diet that way. Success! Everyone loved it. Just the right level of spice for us.

This dish was absolutely amazing. It had the right amount of everything. My husband left the house shortly after dinner and called me as soon as he left to rave on the dish again. I will definitely be making this dish again real soon. Delicious!!

Excellent recipe! But takes too long so I worked to cut the time in half. First difference, I add red bell pepper after caramelizing the onions for a nice texture addition. Then I add ALL the spices at one time and simmer for a couple minutes. I use an additional 1/2 teaspoon Basil and 1/2 teaspoon pepper as my beau is a basil lover. I add tomato sauce and the cream at the same time. Normally use milk and 1/4 block cream cheese instead of cream to make it a little healthier. After that mixture combines, I leave it to simmer while I brown the chicken. I cook the chicken in a saucepan with vegetable oil with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper seasoning until it is fully cooked and starting to crisp. Then combine everything and only simmer for another 2 minutes. Serve over rice and top with parsley to make it pretty. Comes out as excellent as the original but 40 minutes to make instead of 1.3 hours! My Pakistani boyfriend eats at least two helpings every time!

Cut down on Cayenne for those in the fam that hate heat and omitted the ginger because we were out. Substituted milk for the heavy cream. Also added potatoes. First time I've made a dish with no leftovers!

Perfect!  Added peas for color and will probably add cauliflower next time.

Planning on making it in a huge batch to freeze as suggested. Our new go-to meal.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was amazing! This was the second time I made Tikka Masala but the first time I have used this recipe. I have to admit that this has ranked up in my top 5 all time favorite meals. I have never had this meal so, I have nothing to compare the authenticity of this recipe. Only thing I had to change was the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp, since my grandmother was here for dinner. I myself had to go for seconds with this one! So delicious and the depth of flavor is exquisite. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and bringing a little bit of culture to a small town in Kansas! Loved it and it deserves 100+ stars!

WOW. So good. Even my kids loved it and now they might even join me for an Indian buffet one day. I didn’t have any heavy cream so I used half a cup of whole milk and half a cup of plain Greek yogurt. I also used leftover rotisserie chicken for a quick weekday dinner. LOVED it!

This was very good!  My family really enjoyed it.  My daughter wanted curry for her birthday dinner.  So even though this isn't heavy on the curry, it seemed to fit the occasion.  

Was pretty easy to make.  The only change I made was to add about another teaspoon of curry to the sauce ahead of adding in the chicken.  Some of us can handle SUPER spicy hot food and some not so much.  So I added about half the cayenne, divided the sauce, and then added the full amount plus of cayenne to one part of the sauce. That way all of us were able to enjoy it.  I am pretty sensitive to spicy and I was able to enjoy it with the halved amount of cayenne.

To accommodate the folks that struggle with dairy in my family, next time I make it I am going to substitute coconut cream and almond milk instead of the whipping cream.  I'll keep you posted as to how that worked out.  :)

I made this for two other people and it was a big hit with everyone! Very flavorful and filling, and very easy to make. You could definitely up the spice to any level you like- I kept it mild the first time, but when I make it again (and I definitely will) I'll increase the heat!

Took the advice of another reviewer  to make it more friendly to my diet,  I used fat free half n half instead of the heavy whipping cream and Olive Oil in place of the Ghee.. It was delicious! We really enjoyed it and I plan on making it again!

I've made this 20+ times now, never felt the need to change a single thing with this sauce...I would recommend about a tb of garam masala over your chicken along with the curry powder. Absolutely delicious over rice. Bake naan bread in the oven w/basil and garlic to scrape up every last drop of that incredible sauce. This is always in our weekly rotation.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! 10 stars! It's so amazing that I have been using this website for a while and this is my first review which I definitely had to do after making this...My husband and I love it so much, we will definitely keep this recipe on hands for future use. The taste was up to par of great Indian restaurants and all the work it takes is definitely worth it!

I made it exactly as the recipes states (butter instead of ghee) and this is the best tikka masala I have eaten.  Perfect balance of heat and flavor and creaminess.  Highest marks!!

Used olive oil, slightly less cayenne, small tomato sauce , small tomato paste, and 1% milk.   Made it early afternoon and let it sit until dinner for flavors to really meld together.  Tastes amazing!  3 teenagers, hubby and I all loved it.

My wife loves Indian food, so I gave this a try. When I made this for her and my picky daughters, they loved it. I have made it several times and it always turns out great! It takes me some time to make, but it is well worth the effort.

Truly one of my favorite recipes I've ever made on Allrecipes! I love eating at California Chutney, and this was soooo close to the Chicken Tika Masala I order there. It was somehow slightly off (& I've made this recipe about 3xs since I discovered it) and because I don't normal work with the spices I'm having a hard time to figure out that slight alteration to make it 100% perfect and authentic like.

Great recipe, thanks! I made a few changes as I'm keto. 1. subbed truvia for the sugar and 2. used Rao's brand Tomato sauce (no added sugars so less carbs) and for that I think it needs a little more Truvia next time I make it for extra sweetness. I also added broccoli and bell pepper when sauteing the chicken. I made a whole batch of this spice mix for next time and used probably 2x what the recipe actually calls for as I let the chicken marinate in some of it beforehand. Next time I'll take OP's advice and add more cayenne as well, this is definitely the mild version.

Amazing!   Completely satisfied my craving for Indian food tonight and it was super simple to make once the ingredients were cut and prepped.

I added diced red bell pepper and mushrooms to the onions along with a tablespoon of butter flavored olive oil.  Than right before adding the tomato sauce threw in some frozen chopped broccoli  (cooked until thawed before adding the garlic and tomato sauce).  Otherwise,  I followed the recipe to a tee.

Perfection as written!  But.... I add sliced carrots and frozen peas  to get some veggie's into us and serve over Basmati rice.  We actually crave this dish so I make it 2-3 times a month!  Even better as leftovers.

Very good. Needs a veggie side. Tried over quinoa but didn't love it - would be much better with rice.

Ours turned out more like a chicken curry rather than Tikka masala, but was still very good. I would add some chopped bell pepper next time for more veggies.

I made this recipe the other day and I can honestly say it is one of the best dishes I have ever made (and eaten).  I made it exactly as shown, except I used regular unsalted butter and added minced cilantro on top when it was in the bowl.  

The flavors are addicting and the dish is pretty simple to make.  I have been eating it as leftovers the past few days and the flavors just continue to meld.

This dish is so good that I can't wait to make it again.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Just amazing. I ask my boyfriend to make this all the time, it’s a hit at events, and honestly better than the Indian restaurants I’ve eaten at. I went to an Indian lunch buffet and it just wasn’t as flavorful and was kinda watery. We always use jasmine rice, I’ve never been the kind of person to care about the kind of rice I’ve used until this recipe, jasmine rice is much better than plain ole white rice!

I used what I had on hand: thighs instead of breasts, whole milk instead of cream, butter instead of ghee. I also added things a little out of order and about 1 TBSP of cayenne, but it was still magnificent (and awesomely spicy). I would have added a bit more sugar and salt at the end, but I recently came into a fantastic mango hot sauce that perfected this, and kicked it up another notch.

Great for my diet (mostly keto) and my husband's (with rice added), and incredibly tasty!

This was very delicious and like the curry that I get in Indian restaurants. At first it tasted a little off, but I upped the garam masala and it tasted just right. I'm definitely planning to make it again.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!

Other than adding an additional 1/4 teaspoon of tikka Masala, I followed the recipe exactly as written and loved it. I will definitely make this again but next time will only use 1/4 cayenne so the kids can eat it too.

I also think I’ll substitute the chicken for shrimp.

Excellent recipe!!

“Consider Half the Tomato Sauce.” Excellent recipe. I’ve made this several times. I once accidentally made it with half the amount of tomato sauce. I had to add a bit of water to compensate for lacking liquid, but overall quite preferred the finished product over the original recipe. If you find the original recipe more tomato-y than you like, I’d recommend my alteration.

This was so good! I used half and half instead of heavy cream and added that at the very end so it wouldn't separate but it ended up perfectly creamy and flavorful. Will definitely be making again-thank you for sharing!

This was delicious and the closest to our favorite restaurant I have found!  I had home-canned tomatoes and wanted it a little saucy, so I used two jars.  Turned out awesome.  The heat in this isn't too much and builds.  I also love that it is something that can simmers for awhile.  Perfect when having friends over.  This will become a regular in our house.

I have made this dish several times and it is my favorite recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala. It is a bit of work to make the sauce, but the result is spectacular. It also freezes very well so if you are cooking for 2 as I am, I am always excited to have leftovers of the sauce to freeze and enjoy later. I highly recommend this recipe, just as it is.

After trying every premade store bought sauce that I could find and not getting any satisfaction I decided to give Allrecipes a try since it’s never let me down in the past. This is hands down better than any sauce I have tried, even those at the local Indian restaurants here in Los Angeles. Thank you for posting this. I plan on making this in bulk and freezing/meal prepping.

I’ve made this so many times and I’ve given out the recipe as well. It really is as good (or better) than some restaurant curry! The heavy cream makes this really fattening but I can’t imagine the dish without it. Just don’t make it every single week like I did for a few months or you’ll have to buy bigger pants. ;)

My eyes rolled in the back of my head this was so delicious. This is the single best thing I’ve cooked in my life. I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular butter because I’m cheap. The kids loved it too. It will be going in the regular rotation.

Love this recipe!  I followed suggestions from couple of other reviewers, marinated chicken thigh chunks in the curry and fat free greek yogurt.  I also used 8 oz half and half, 15 oz crushed tomatoes, and a 6oz can of tomato paste to lower the fat content.  This one is a favorite in our house!!!

It was very good but there was a depth of flavor that was missing, even though I amped up the amount of garlic and spices and even added dollops of garlic/ginger paste. 
I'll make it again add even more spices, I think. And maybe a bit more salt.

HEAVENLY. Made it what I had--butter instead of Ghee, half & half instead of cream, and tofu instead of chicken... served it with jasmine rice, garlic naan, and roasted cauliflower steaks... Such amazing taste! This is a keeper!

I didn't use the cayenne pepper at all because my husband cannot do high spices. This was delicious! still too spicy for him (I guess it's the amount of curry) but this recipe is a keeper. Next time I'll try coconut milk instead of heavy cream for a healthier recipe.

Made this as near to the recipe as possible as I live in Bulgaria and cannot get everything. Fabulous! Much better than the jar stuff and very easy. Have saved to favourites and will make many times more. I will batch make it and freeze as I like having good homemade food as an easy meal on the odd days :)

Wow! Don't change a thing. Make sure you have Naan to soak up delicious sauce. And we had mangos on the side. Bought a bag in frozen section. Better than Indian restaurant near us. And super easy! Just slow down when reading the recipe because there are many steps.

Yes!  Thank you for the recipes and reviews.  Got home from picking up groceries and immediately added half brown/half rice with chicken bone broth to my rice cooker while sauteing the onion. Took a shortcut and used precooked, chopped chicken from our local supermarket. I used low fat half and half, added spinach and eyeballed the spices. Seemed pretty easy with a great taste and DH gave a thumbs up. Next I'll pick up some Naan  to go with.

This recipe was outstanding! I'm glad I served it with Naan bread to sop up the sauce, otherwise I would've had to lick my plate clean.

The reviews are spot on - this is restaurant quality!  I'm very picky about my Indian food and this was 5 stars!  Made it as written and it was perfect.  Definitely will be doubling it next time so we can have left overs!  Served it with naan, jasmine rice and finished with chopped cilantro on top - will be making this again very soon!

Made it exactly as written except I  added very thin carrots to sauce and chicken and simmered for 35 minutes.  My 10 year old TOTALLY asked for more!  ;)

This was amazing! I’ve never really ventured into Indian cuisine, but considering the rave reviews I wanted to give it a shot. I made it exactly as is, served over jasmine rice.  It was a bit spicy for my daughter, but my husband and I went back for seconds. Will definitely be making again.

I reduced salt to 3/4 tsp and used no added salt tomato sauce, otherwise followed recipe. This is excellent! It really doesn't take too much time to make. I could drink the sauce! It seems to get even better the next day! Will definitely make this again. It satisfies a spicy food craving nicely.

I have made this numerous times as the original recipe and then with some substitutions. Absolutely wonderful!! Adding coconut milk from the can makes a tasty sub for the cream.

This was delicious! Better than my favorite local restaurant. As far as spice level- my husband and oldest son wanted more heat. For me and my youngest son, I’d halve the cayenne. I’ll make this over ordering out anytime!

Loved it, seriously good. Other than my house stinking like curry for like 3 days, it was well worth it! I made a few substitutions per the review of a healthier alternative and it turned out great! Re-heats very well too.

Fantastic. If you're afraid to dip your toe into the pool of Indian food, this is a great way to start. I've always liked it, but couldn't convince the rest of the family because "Everything just tastes like curry powder!". Once I started cooking this, they didn't want to give me the satisfaction of it smelling amazing. Now it's a regular family dinner. Great dish to make in my Instapot, too.

I've made this more times than I can count. Its a staple in our meal rotation for SURE. The only change/addition I make is golden raisins. I put about a cup of golden raisins in a microwavable dish with water, boil it until they are nice and plump, drain the water, and add to the sauce. YUM! If you are looking for a yummy comfort food THIS recipe is a great one!

I had never made anything like this before and was a little nervous, I'm not big on spicy foods. All I changed from the recipe was cut down the cayenne pepper a tad and used half-and-half instead of heavy whipping cream (all I had on hand). Turned out fantastic, just enough heat with that deliciously creamy sauce. This will be making its way into regular dinner rotation.!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the chicken.  Other reviewers had recommended marinating the chicken pieces in plain yogurt which I did, and then prepared it as written.   My family of teenagers and husband really liked this even with the slight kick.  It is definitely a "make again".

Excellent!  I didn't have ghee, so just used vegetable oil.  I didn't have cream, but did have coconut milk and used it.  I'm sure it will be even better if I had those ingredients.  I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic recipe!  Doesn’t need the full sugar amount and you can adjust the cayenne to your heat preference.  I found my sauce didn’t need as long to thicken so I just cooked it less.

I made it exactly as the recipe says and put it over white rice. It was amazing! It was spicy but not too spicy and I had enough for leftovers. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I'm usually not satisfied with the Indian recipes I make at home but this is awesome. My 8 year old freaked out over this and asked for thirds. Will make a hundred times more maybe add a little more heat .
Made a few more times and now I add frozen peas and fresh broccoli the last five minutes of cooking. 
 I love this recipe.

Very satisfied.  I used coconut cream instead of heavy whipping cream and left out the sugar.  I was out of tomato sauce so I used tomato soup instead.

Only used half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it packed enough punch for my family's liking! Very flavorful, the best recipe I've found and will definitely be making again.

So...I LOVEEEE Indian food and live in Los Angeles where I have access to delicious cuisines.  That being said, this is such an incredibly delicious authentic recipe! I have made it probably about a dozen times or so now. I pretty much follow it exactly but the only things I do sometimes depending on the consistency (have no idea why but sometimes the sauce is thinner than other times), is add a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it (that makes it easier to sop up with yummy naan).

Super-easy to make and totally legitimate! As described it is not haute-cusine-slave-over-at-hot-stove-all-day-long Indian food, but it is a delicious and fast Tikka Masala if you have a craving for it. It is a two pan dish. I simmered the sauce in a large saute pan while I cooked the chicken in a cast iron skillet. Combine them and, voila! Street food perfection.

Very good version! Suggestions: don't add the sugar at the end, and make extra sauce for naan dipping. I added just a tsp of sugar at the end and wish I hadn't because it mellowed out the flavors some. I made basmati rice and the garlic naan recipe from this site and together it was a delicious meal!

We have never eaten anything like this before. It was sooooo good! Thank you for posting the recipe. The only change I made was I cut the cayenne pepper back to 1/4 tsp. I REALLY don’t like heat :)

Really good but a tad heavy on the cinnamon. Wish I had added cilantro as I had it on hand but since it wasn't in the recipe I didn't use it to stay true; will use it next time.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I substituted coconut milk for the cream because I'm allergic to dairy. It still tasted just like the restaurant version. It's amazing!

Holy , this is delicious! This is the first Indian dish I've made, and it beat the pants off of anything I've had at my favorite Indian restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly, and would not change a thing. It had enough heat for my husband, who likes spicy foods, and plenty of heat for my daughter (8) and me. Served it with jasmine rice.  I think it helped that I cut the chicken pieces pretty small. Definitely a keeper.

We are Dairy Free in our home.  I used "canned" coconut cream rather than heavy cream. Instead of Ghee I used Avocado Oil.   It was outstanding.

ABsolutely amazing recipe!  I don’t cook that much, but this was an easy recipe to make.  Not too time consuming and well worth the effort.  I made it exactly as it reads and it was sooooo good.  I made the sauce ahead of time and then just heated it up and added the cooked chicken.  Served with rice and it was a big hit.

Simply "soul food" yummy, reminds me of a "hole in the wall" Indian diner that was always packed.  The street sign was small, the signature the wonderful spices wafting through the air.

I doubled the cayenne because I like a lot of heat.  I am really surprised I didn't see more comments about this calling for too much cumin.  It's really overpowering with a whole TBSP.  I will try 2 tsp next time.  Overall, quite good.

I made the dish almost exactly as the recipe was written.  I had to halve the recipe since I only had so much chicken. I did cook the chicken through before adding it to the sauce but still let it all simmer for 20 or so minutes afterward. I mistakenly added the curry to the sauce rather than on the chicken but it did not seem to matter. To suit my family's tastes I added additional curry, paprika, and salt. I omitted the onion but sprinkled minced onion into the sauce instead.

Incredible dish. I’m very picky about Tikka masala and find that even Indian restaurants don’t even do

I used whole chicken thighs instead of cutting up small pieces because the thighs are usually juicier. While cooking, everything was smelling amazing until I added the cinnamon. It just isn't my particular taste. So after following the rest of the directions, I tossed in  bunch more curry powder and garlic to try to cover it up, but I can still smell it in there. It looks great though! It's still simmering, and the rice isn't done either, so I haven't tasted it yet. Hopefully I'll be pleasantly surprised. Thank you for sharing your beloved recipe!

This was EXCELLENT! My sister told me to follow the directions without making any changes, at least the first time. I wasn't disappointed! I didn't have the cream but used coconut milk instead.  My mother ate the first serving WITHOUT the milk and loved it. I couldn't do it, it was too hot.  You get a real kick from cayenne pepper. NEXT time I'll add green onions and diced tomatoes. I need at least one vegetable.

My husband and I live this recipe! I don’t use as much sugar but everything else is perfect! We eat it with Basmati rice. It’s an easy recipe as long as you have all the necessary spices.

Fantastic recipe. Came out amazing. I made it a little healthier. Used petite diced tomatoes and blended them. Half the carbs than sauce. Also, used half and half instead of whipping cream and no sugar. Favorite new dish.

This is great. I didn’t have any ghee, so I just used salted butter.  I also didn’t have tumeric so I left that out. I didn’t have heavy whipping cream, so I used half and half. It was still amazing and so delicious! My husband and my son both loved it as well!

I made this for my family and it was a hit. I used heavy whipping cream and I went heavier on the spices. If I were to make it again I would have salted the chicken a little bit more. Great recipe.

This recipe is a favorite at our house. The main modification we've made is to use only 1 tsp of sugar rather than 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp, which was way too sweet for our tastes.  My husband has converted the recipe for cooking in the Instant Pot, which makes the chicken super tender every time.

This is the most amazing chicken tikka recipe I have ever made! I will never pay the high price of chicken tikka a a restaurant when this is even better! I use exactly 3lb of boneless chicken thighs, which seems to better with the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for. Leftovers next day are even better! I also added 1tspn of coriander and 1tsnp of garam masala to give it that authentic taste. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I used to buy a block of curry and can of coconut milk and make a pretty decent chicken curry.  Not anymore - I loved this recipe it has excellent flavor.  Knowing that I am not a huge salt lover or sugar lover - I went easier on those two ingredients and skipped the "optional" parts and it came out great!  I did try one suggestion and use milk - didn't work so well - it curdled,  but not to the point it was inedible.  I'll use coconut milk the next time and avoid that graininess.  Great with some homemade paneer and rice.

this is truly excellent.  no one spice overpowers the others, and creates a very well-balanced flavor.  a snap to prepare.  I added fresh spinach and some cilantro to the dish, and only 1.5 # of chicken.  I did not use the cream but chose to use fat free half & half instead, and added a bit of tomato paste to adjust for the consistency.  Served over basmati rice, and garlic naan.  thanks so much!  this is a keeper and does taste restaurant quality.

Made this exactly as stated, except doubled the recipe. My family absolutely loved it. Just as good or better than most Indian restaurants. Served with homemade Indian basmati rice and naan.

Absolutely loved this dish!!! Instead of 1tsp of Cayenne, I only used 1/2tsp, and it was still a little spicy! Don't forget the Pita Bread!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

absolutely  delicious. I  made this for dinner, I'm in bed now and I want to go back downstairs and get more. I didn't have any cream so I  used can of coconut milk. I added more ginger and cayenne also.

Currently eating and it's amazing. Followed the recipe as is, even measured out spices which I rarely do unless I'm baking. Next time I'm going to double the recipe, keep the same amount of chicken and add veggies.

Edit! I've made this two times now as is in the recipe except with the addition of bell peppers and once with coconut milk and without the sugar, delicious dairy free alternative!  I usually double the recipe and freeze half of it in small tupperware, reheats very well and can go for a long time when you add rice or more veggies.

This is sooooooooooooooooooooooo good!   Uses spices you've probably already have.  Want to sop up all of it with my nan.  Will make again soon.

I don’t normally leave reviews because I’m always changing recipes, but this one didn’t need any changes. This was outstanding! Even my picky toddler loved it! We follow a Primal diet so the only swaps I made were maple sugar for white sugar, and avocado oil for vegetable oil. I served this with roasted asparagus, coconut lime cauliflower “rice,” and homemade grain free naan. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was so delicious.  My family really liked it.  I minimized the cayenne in the recipe for my kids, my added crushed rex pepper to my serving at the end, and it was fantastic.  I will make this again.

This is a keeper! Delish! Made as directed, without any added Salt or sugar to taste at the end. The chicken is so tender, simmered in an amazingly flavorful sauce. If you don’t like a little kick, my recommendation would be to half the cayenne.

I followed the recipe exactly  and it was very good.  And a bit of an adventure for I'd never tried an Indian recipe before.  The family liked it, too so I'll make it again soon.

I followed the recipe.  No changes (as far as I know).  I used 1.5 lbs. boneless/skinless chicken breast.  The taste is amazing.  Served it over stir-fried zucchini, seasoned with a little garlic salt and ground black pepper.  1 tsp. of cayenne pepper in the sauce is perfect for me.  If you are a person that can't handle spicy heat, eliminate the cayenne pepper and let people add to their individual servings.   YUM

This was great. My boyfriend said it was on par with what he used to order from his favorite restaurant. I wouldn’t say it’s the BEST version I’ve ever had, but it is for sure restaurant quality. I was so excited that something this great came out of my kitchen!

Also- I followed the instructions pretty much exactly. It was pretty spicy, which I loved, but just a heads up for everyone else.

Turned out great!! Halfed the recipe & added canned mushrooms. It started to look like there was too much chicken so I added some chicken broth and let that simmer and worked out well. It has a nice spice from the cayenne and is well seasoned :)

Second time I've made this and it is such a favorite - friends walking into the house are asking what smells so good.  I punch up the cayenne because we like spicy but that's the only change I make.  LOVE IT!!!!

So good! My boyfriend loved it. At first it was a bit tomatoie so I added extra curry. I added a dash of chili powder and about 1/4 cup chicken broth to the sauce. Made it with jasmine rice on the side. Using the leftover sauce today!

This was easy to make and very good.  It wasn't quite the "nuclear-orange" tikka masala that I expected based on the description (I was hoping it would be like our local Indian restaurant), but it was still delicious so I will be making it many times again (just not when I'm craving "nuclear-orange" tikka masala - I will still have to visit the restaurant for that it seems).  I will however be probably doubling the amount of ingredients for the sauce.  As it is the sauce was plenty to coat the chicken, but there was not extra sauce to put over the rice I served the chicken over.

My entire family loved this dish! I put in only 1/2 tsp. cayenne, and that was plenty of heat for me and the hubs and not too much for the kiddos.  i didn't measure the cream, but probably only added 1/2-3/4 c.  It was super easy to make, and the first Indian recipe I've made that was a hit with everyone.

So good!! And really not that hard! Served with basmati rice. I straight up omitted the cayenne as I was feeding 2-8 year olds...All liked and ate it! My husband and I loved it. Will definitely save and make again, and I just might need to make in bulk and freeze! We don't live in an area that is rich in ethnic options and this really nailed it. If I was preparing for adults I would definitely not be shy adding at least the 1tsp of cayenne next time. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Prepared as described in the recipe, but I seldom use measuring cups or spoons . I just guesstimate most of the time. This meal was absolutely delicious. Don’t let the spices scare you off, it wasn’t very hot. If you want it spicy, boost the measure of cayenne pepper, but don’t go crazy! The cinnamon taste was key in this recipe IMHO. Served it up with a French Pinot Noir that paired well.

Made it according to the directions the first time, except I used butter instead of ghee.  Second time, I accidentally poured oil in the pan instead of butter and used 1% milk instead of cream and it still tasted great. I make the sauce, then put cubed tofu right in it while it's simmering and serve the whole thing over rice.  Is also good with extra veggies cooked in.  My kids like it too!

Love this recipe!! It’s amazing, even my kids love it. I need to cut the cayenne pepper in half for them and we like to grill the chicken for a bit of smokiness but other than that, it’s perfect. Great receipt thank you.

This is an amazing recipe! I am by no means a master chef and I pulled this off! I doubled the recipe (except the chicken) because I wanted more sauce. The juice from the chicken made it the right consistency AND the right amount of chicken... It was a win. I won’t put as much cayenne pepper in, as I hear my kids sniffling, but this is one the favorite menu for sure!

Made it twice in 1 week! I could have gone with more spice however my father is very sensitive when it comes o spice and he thought the recipe as is was spicy enough. I used margarine instead of Ghee as that is all I had but it still tasted great!

This is outrageously good! And I even accidentally messed it up by using spaghetti sauce rather than plain tomato sauce. (It was basil and tomato flavor; I put in a tablespoon of tomato paste to try to counteract the basil. But, I didn't have to simmer as long to thicken the sauce...!) I haven't even made the chicken yet, but this sauce is great! I'm going to try it with eggplant. Measure all spices and liquids ahead of time, then mix. So easy. Love it!

Absolutely love this recipe. Make it all the time for my boyfriend and I. instead of the skillet though I do a crockpot for 8 hrs on low. Also switched out whipping cream for vanilla yogurt and tomato sauce for tomato puree to help thicken the curry.

This is actually less involved than you'd think. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I took 1 can of paste and added that to 1 cup of hot water. Also, did not have enough heavy cream, so I had 3/4 left and used 1/4 a cup of whole milk. This probably turned out more close to what you'd buy at a store given that most ingredients will state tomato paste. Really good with some homemade naan! Overall this recipe took me about 15 minutes to make the way that I did it.

Just exceptional. I add more cayenne  for heat and sprinkle about a teaspoon of garam masala over the chicken as its cooking, along with the suggested curry powder. Have made this so many times in the last month I finally wrote it into my 'Favorites' recipe book!  The best I've tried.

Super easy, super fantastic!! As good as any I have ever had!! Made for my dad's first try, and he loved it. (Yes, a farm boy born in the 30's!) Next time I will 3-4x the sauce, (so I have left overs)   the chicken is obviously easy to adjust to preference.  LOVE!!!

I made it just about exactly as written except that I didn't have ghee so used the olive oil someone suggested as a calorie saver. I also chopped my chicken up a bit smaller so it cooked a little faster and threw in some baby spinach right before serving. I served with naan bread,  salad and orange slices. The picky little ones took second helpings and my husband and I were quite happy too.

Amazing!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  We do not eat dairy in our house, so I substituted the ghee for oil, and instead of half and half, I used coconut cream.  You could not taste the coconut at all.

So good. I did use a half a teaspoon of cayenne instead of 1 teaspoon because I was afraid it would be too hot and I'm glad I did. I also didn't have any cream so I used coconut milk instead and in place of adding sugar I added a handful of sweetened coconut.

First time making curry and I was pleasantly surprised with what I made! It smelled- and tasted- like the tikki masala I've had in restaurants though I like the consistency of this recipe better. I made a slight change and used 1 tbsp olive oil to fry the onions instead of ghee because olive oil was something I already had in the pantry.  The recipe was also extremely easy to make though it require some time. I will definitely make this recipe again soon!

So good!  I know the recipe was toned down with only 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, but if you're making it for kids, I'd advise maybe half a teaspoon.  Great recipe!

This was very good, but tasted a lot like other chicken tikka masala recipes I've made, which had fewer steps. I marinated it in advance, with yogurt, cumin, turmeric, and paprika. I used half in half instead of cream, because that's what I had. My husband loved it, but it was a bit too spicy for the kids even after I added extra half and half. Will definitely make again for the sauce alone, and maybe make a veggie tikka masala instead.

I make this recipe a couple of time a month. I've quadrupled it for parties and it is always a crowd pleaser. I use oil instead of ghee, milk instead of cream and I sauté the chicken first, then take it out of the Dutch oven then cook the onions and garlic in the chicken fat, only one pot to wash!!

It was fantabulous. I made many curries from scratch before but this is the ONE. My picky daughter who never eats curry had seconds. Only changes I made is I used vegetable oil instead of ghee and I added frozen peas the last 10 min. I served it with white rice.. we all had seconds and my husband went for a third! Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe.

This recipe has become a go to. Sometimes I add carrots or cauliflower.  I know that might make me a heretic.

This time I halved the amount of chicken and added a whole bunch of baby asparagus cut into three inch pieces.  I guess I cut the chicken a little small because it didn't need the last five minutes.  The asparagus went in 10 minutes before serving which left them with a nice bright green color and perfect amount of crunch.

Great spices, I substituted coconut milk for the cream because its what i had. Consistency was good, but may i may have to adjust some spices to make it right for me.  But great for a first time try at this dish.

I have been looking for the best Tikka Masala recipe for some time and think I have found it. Our family love good curry recipes and this one is in our top 5! ...full of flavor and with that mild sweetness that we enjoy. Thanks for hitting the mark with this.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The recipe author noted reduced cayenne pepper and encouraged more.  It was plenty hot with one teaspoon of cayenne.

I rarely eat Indian food, but I am so glad I tried this recipe.  My husband, who doesn't like spicy food, loved it and went back for seconds!  I'm sure the fragrant aromas helped his appetite. I found this recipe simple to put together.  This goes on my top 10 list for chicken recipes.

I have made this recipe multiple times and as anther reviewer wrote and suggested,I make twice the sauce and freeze it in portions either for two or one,for future use for a quick and easy dinner. It is fabulous as is written but sometimes I even add some sour cream that is hanging around in the refrigerator or yogurt for that matter!! Always delicious!!

This is my go to Chicken Tikka Recipe! After having lived in Japan and tasted the wonderful Indian there most places in the US just didn't cut it. Now that I found this recipe my family prefers to dine in when they have a craving for Indian and I really enjoy the process of making this. Smelling the spices develop is my favorite part. I made a couple of changes. I add quite a bit more cinnamon that it requires probably about 2 tablespoons and I cut down on the cayenne pepper and only use 1/8 teaspoon since my 2 and 5 year old eat this. Even they say this is their favorite thing I make!

Hubby and I loved it!  There were so many ratings based on the actual recipe that we had to try it!  I do think switching the order of cooking makes sense so I cooked the chicken first and used the same pan for the sauce.  Make it easy on yourself and have all ingredients ready :-)

Very good and easily modified to be low fat with the substitution of fat free half-and-half. Next time I think I will probably use lite coconut milk instead as I prefer that flavor. I'll probably also halve the cayenne.

I've made other Tikka Masala recipes but there's definitely something special about this one. I didn't have ginger or turmeric, but it still turned out wonderfully. The long simmering action really helps meld the flavours together beautifully. I added some chickpeas after the chicken and some spinach at the end and served with fluffy white rice.  It's a great recipe I'll be making again!

Maybe for the first time ever, I followed the recipe to the letter. Perfect as is, I don't see changing a thing the next time I make it. It is a bit spicier than I prefer, but I thought the hubby would like it. He loves it. It is a lot easier to make than anticipated since most of the ingredients are spices. This one is a keeper!

Good!  Very good!  The recipe exactly suited my heat-taste level!  However, while simmering, I added a dash of lime juice because it seemed too sweet.  My son-in-law sprinkled a fair amount of Garam Masala seasoning and stirred it in to elevate the  heat in his dish and my daughter sprinkled a little bit of Cardamom seasoning and stirred it in to decrease the heat in her dish.

This was really good.   I like spicy food and the heat in this dish was  perfect for me.   The only ingredient change I made was to double the garlic, but then I do that with every recipe that calls for it.  I only made enough chicken to feed one person (me!) and froze the rest of the sauce.  Next time, I will make a double batch of sauce and cook the chicken later as needed.

I am attempting to write a review in the middle of shoveling bites into my mouth. This.Is.Amazing. Once the spices start frying together your mouth starts to water and you still have another 40 minutes of simmering to do. It's so worth the wait, but the waiting is hard. I always double the sauce and I make 4 C basmati rice (rinsed, with 5 C water and some cardamom pods) in the rice cooker while this is cooking and it leaves enough for lunch the next day. That's cooking for 5, by the way. 
If you are trying to decide if you are going to make this or not, just do it. The only change I have ever made to this is using ginger paste instead of ground ginger because that's what I have in the house.

Oh. My. Goodness. 10 out of 5! My boyfriend said it's the best tikka he's had by miles, better than any restaurant, and I agree! Few little tweaks for personal taste; used half the salt to season the chicken, alongside curry powder and a teaspoon of garam masala. I fried the chicken first, put to one side & used the same skillet to make the sauce. I used double the spices but split in half, fried half as directed and added the rest to the sauce halfway through cooking. I added crushed up cashews and fresh chopped coriander (cilantro) at the end. Was truly wonderful, one of the best meals I've ever tasted, never mind made! My 2 year old loved it (I added yogurt to cool it down for her). Thank you so much for a beautiful recipe xx

My husband loved this recipe.  He said several times during dinner, "this is really good!"  I didn't have heavy cream or tomato sauce, I used skim milk and tomato paste adding warm water.  It still turned out great! All in all it is an easy recipe, although not quick it was worth the time.

This was awesome! It actually was not that time consuming I changed a couple things. I took out the cayenne because my family doesn't like hot food and I substituted the can of tomato sauce for plain jar spaghetti sauce. I replaced chicken breasts with boneless skinless thighs because it was way more juicy!

Takes a while to make, but it was so good! I used half the amount of red pepper and it was still spicy-ish (from someone who doesn't eat a lot of spicy food).

This is an awesome recipe, all my friends beg me to make it when they come over. I add 1/2 tablespoon of garam masala to the reciepe, and maybe a bit (1/4 tablespoon) more of cayenne pepper, but i love spicy food. If your feeling like a real kick add some red pepper as well.

Awesome recipe, it is very tasty with good heat but not overwhelming.  I did add chickpeas but only because they were in the refrigerator begging to be thrown into this great Tikka Masala Sauce.  Five Stars all the way.

This was a hit with all of my kids (12, 10, 8).  I made it in the pressure cooker.  Same ingredients for the sauce - and I had them all on hand!  Started with everything but the cream.  Used frozen chicken thighs for 9 mins (and natural release).  Then I removed the chicken & added the cream, used the saute feature on my Instant Pot until it was thickened.

This is one of our favorite recipes. We love doubling it so that we have enough for leftovers. It is great with any kind of the hedge. I like to look in my fridge and see what I have available and throw it in. We up the hot a little bit with some extra Cayanne pepper. Yum!

This is on point. I've lived in India/Nepal at different times and will attest that this tastes authentic and incredible. I made it just as is and wouldn't change a thing. I did combine the dry spices together (cumin, salt, ginger, etc) so it was easy to toss it all in when it was time. My main advise would be don't rush it, do just as it says. I made it a second time for about 20 people and got in a hurry, and I could tell as the flavors were not as rich and deep.

I made this just as the recipe calls for and it was DELICIOUS!!   Next time I'll add more cayenne because I like mine a little on the fiery side. My wife devoured all of the leftovers!!!!! I'll  definitely be making this again soon.

Fantastic!! I just moved and there is no good Indian food around me. This more than satisfies my cravings. The only changes I made: cut back on salt, no sugar, and add a bit more cayenne. Going to try making this in the slow cooker too.

Great dish. My 5 years old grandchildren love it as well, although I skip cayenne pepper, when they come for dinner.
Today, I'll cook again, for adults, and I'll stick to the original recipe.

Very good recipe - the first time I had made anything with so many spices!   I made it according to the recipe and it was not too spicy for us.  We loved it and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks!

I make this every few weeks in different variations of the recipe. I always add chickpeas for myself and chicken on the side for my hubby. Sweet tomato sauce and cayenne make it sweet and spicy :-)

I loved this recipe, and will definitely make it again!  I only reduced the amount of cayenne to 1/4 tsp because I'm not a fan of really spicy food.

I'm giving this dish 4 stars as is, and I'll explain why. Last night was the second time that I made this dish. The first time, I couldn't find my Cayenne, so I replaced it with additional Curry. My boyfriend, who loves any kind of Asian food just raved about it. Last night, I made the recipe exactly as it's shown above. In my opinion, it was better with the extra Curry, but my boyfriend also loved the extra spice last night. Next time I make it, it will get both so that it's perfect. Double batch with extra large breasts so I don't have to cook again until Friday? Score!

Chicken Tikka Masala is the national dish of England, and I've eaten it many times. This is about as good as restaurant quality as you'll find. If you want to make it even better, you should make Chicken Tikka the authentic way and then add it to the sauce. Its more work, but totally worth it.

Holy COW. Or chicken. Where is the 6th star on this rating system?

I followed this TO THE LETTER, and it was AMAZING. Normally, I'm the type to add fresh ginger, herbs, and what not, but this time, I just let go and went with it. And the flavor in this recipe is full bodied and crazy good. The thing I was most impressed with that normally, Tikka Masala calls for chicken thighs, but I'm trying to lighten things up for my tubby-hubby and this was , hand down, HIS favorite tikka masala recipe I've made yet as well. (We won't go on about how picky of an eater he is, but.....) This is officially my new fav, and I will come back and do this the next time we've got a craving for some G.A.S. (Good @ss sh*t.) Thank you!

Absolutely the best! I cook this every four to six weeks and the only change I make is to double the garlic. If I ever want to make this a vegan entree, it would be easy to do with a couple of  substitutions.

We didn't have heavy cream, so we used coconut milk instead.  It was exactly the flavor we have been looking for in a homemade dish.  This will be in our permanent line-up.  Can't wait to try it again, next time with the heavy cream it calls for because I think it will be even better!  The sauce was flavorful and had a good kick of spice.  You could scale back the cayenne if you wanted it a little more mild.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I don't keep ghee on hand so I used coconut oil instead. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. It was SOOOO good. It makes a lot of sauce, and the flavor is spot on. Now that I know the flavor and texture e right, I plan to experiment with substitutes for the heavy cream to try to make it a bit healthier. I'm thinking coconut cream could work very nicely. I plan to make a huge batch of the sauce without the cream and can it in mason jars. It would make for a super easy weeknight meal. Just fry up some chicken, pour in a jar of sauce, simmer for a while, add a cup of cream, and done. So glad I finally tried this. It's a keeper!

AMAZING!!!!  As another reviewer suggested, I added some garam masala and coriander... and I cut back on the cayenne (half the amount given was the perfect spice for us). I didn't have ghee or the time to make it, so I just used butter...and skipped the onion (used onion powder) because of a picky husband, but it was still SO good. DH kept going off about how good it was! Thank you! :) :) :)

very simple, despite the many spices.  Already have to make it again for my kids.  A little spicy, but they decided that that's what made it good.  To make it simpler, I premixed the spice combinations in a packet to use next time to save all the measuring.

Super! After living with folks from Hyderabad for 9 months, this was a flash back to food they would serve. Tasted authentic to me! Used butter instead of ghee. Besides that, I made it exactly and it was great. Served with roti. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

ONLY because my husband doesn't like chicken breast to begin with, I always marinate when possible, so a large dollop of greek yogurt, garam masala, turmeric, several hours and a work project later... I was pressed for time and I didn't want to wash another pan, so I tossed the raw chicken chunks in right after the cream. Simmered for 30 minutes and it was lovely! I can only imagine how amazing it would be if the chicken was grilled. The char would be such a perfect compliment to the dish! -  Can't wait to make it again, when I have enough time!

Delicious. My entire family begs me to make this dish at least once a week. The only tweak I made is I use more chicken (6) and half the cayenne pepper (for my kids). Otherwise I follow to the letter.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/4 cup of coconut milk while adding 3/4 cup of heavy cream.  It came out wonderfully.  I will surely be making this again.  I served it over basmati rice that I added 1/4 teaspoon each of curry powder and turmeric powder.  When I add spices to rice I mix the spices with the rice in a bowl prior to adding to the water.  Again, a great recipe and a fabulous dish!

This recipe is super good. The only thing that I did differently was season my chicken with some garam masala and pepper along with the curry from the original recipe. For me, I cannot not season my chicken. :-)

My sister who has eaten lots of authentic Indian and Pakistani food gave this 5 stars! And my parents, who are accustomed to chicken that is only salted and peppered, were happy with this!

Wouldn't change a dang thing. This converted my children to Indian food. My 3yo LOVED it. Leftovers were just as good. This will be a staple in our home.

I love this recipe, and make it at least once a month. We have dairy intolerance in the house, so I typically swap out the heavy cream for coconut creamer. Today, they didn’t have any at the store so I bought a can of coconut milk and it turned out just as good.

I thought it was good, nothing special. But my ultra-picky 14 year old ate three helpings, so that rates it 5 stars. I made it vegetarian with Quorn tenders instead of chicken, and to make it slightly more healthy, I only used half of the cream, and supplemented with plain soymilk.

Modified this a little.
6 chicken thighs used over the breast ( better flavour)
Added 1 teaspoon of garam masala and 50/50 cream and yoghurt, also used less cayenne pepper for the kiddies. The family loved it, this is way better then the stuff you would buy in the jar,  yes i takes a little more time with the prep work. would I make this again. Hell yeah!!

Loved it! Very similar to an Indian restaurant in my neighborhood. I added Greek yogurt to tone down the spiciness of the dish.

This was very good, and I was pleased with how easy it is to make.  For my tastes, the spices were weak.  I will make this again, but increase the cayenne and curry powder, maybe the other spices, too.  I didn't have cream, so substituted evaporated milk, and I didn't have tomato sauce, so substituted petite diced tomatoes.  I'll probably use evaporated milk again, as it has far fewer calories and fat than cream, and I doubt it would have changed the flavor much.  I was also out of rice, so served this over quinoa.  I thought this worked fine.

Very easy to make. Follow the recipe to a tee and youll have perfect creamy curry dish. I was making this for kids and adults so I did not use as much paprika or cayenne pepper. Still came out absolutely delish. Will repeat with different types of chicken cuts.

Finally!!!!! The recipe just like a restaurant. 

I've tried a lot of recipes. A LOT. This one knocked it out of the park. Good job, Chris. This is the only Tikka Masala I'll ever make. 

BTW - one tsp of cayenne is pretty hot.  I love some heat and this made me sweat.

My kids loved this recipe! I did have to make a few minor adjustments because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I used tomato soup instead of sauce and had to omit turmeric entirely. I cut the chicken into small pieces and left it separate from the sauce so the kids could customize how much sauce they wanted. (I was a bit worried about the cayenne pepper and yes we went through a lot of milk but they did like it) This recipe is a MUST try!

Awesome. My girlfriend is a vegetarian so we replaced the chicken with diced potatoes and also just used butter/oil instead of ghee (couldn't find any at the local store). I would have preferred it to be a bit spicier (maybe add a little jalapeno?). I will definitely be making this again.

First time making Indian food.  I have never eaten Indian food before so this was a big deal.  I dropped the cayenne pepper to about a 3/4 teaspoon and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  To counter the thinner consistency of the half and half, I added 1 tablespoon of tomato paste. This was very good.  My kids, who also haven't tried Indian food before today, cleaned their plates!  My man, who is less picky than I am and has a more experienced palate than I do, gave this an A+.

I made this recipe two days ago and put it in the fridge and we had it last night. If you want your home to smell like an Indian restaurant.....make this dish! It was very tasty. The only change I made was I cut the Cayenne in about half and it was plenty spicy enough.....and I like lots of spice. I served this with a fresh salad and on top of Basmati Rice. Fully enjoyed the meal and will definitely make again. I guess the only reason for only 4 stars is because it was VERY good but not excellent.... Next time I will add some red and green pepper strips to the mixture. Thanks for the inspiration.

Always turns out great! I have gotten into the habit of making a large pot of the sauce so I can freeze a few batches for later use. All I would have to do later down the road is defrost the sauce and add it to the chicken like normal. Great make ahead meal to have on hand. I have a lot of compliments on this when I make it for others. Love how this turns out.

This is very  very good.  It is almost a little sweet for me and I didn't add the sugar at the end .  I also added a can of sliced potatoes while simmering.  It makes for an nice change of texture and they don't fall apart. 
 
 I did go with more Madras Curry Powder while cooking the chicken and even into the sauce.  I also cooked the chicken first and set aside.  Then started the sauce in the same pan. 
  
Wife ran late from work so it simmered longer which only made it more flavorful .  Served with Naan Bread from the oven and Saffron rice.  Leftovers are going to be amazing.

I agree with the other makers and I could see making the sauce alone or with Indian homemade soft cheese, Paneer.  It's wonderful on brown rice, finger licking on jasmine, and delightful with naan or Peta bread.  So easy to conform to your own taste.  Yum, yum. 8) in Oklahoma

This is an awesome recipe. I used virgin olive oil instead of butter, and as I didn't have any tomato sauce, I puréed canned tomatoes and used tomato paste. The outcome was delicious. I'm keeping this recipe for sure.

Soooo good! I made this recipe as is with the exception of the ghee (did not have so I substituted with butter and oil) and it was absolutely amazing. I do feel like it is missing a slight something in the realm of spice (needs a little more of something or another spice) and I will update this review with an 'Edited Recipe' version once I have figured out the missing link! As is however, the recipe is on-point. So good!

This was excellent, I did swap can of coconut milk for the heavy cream, (didn't have the cream) and used fish for the protein.  The flavor was great my husband had two helpings and I will make this again and again. Thanks for the recipes.

I have made this recipe many times because I love it. It's a great dish to make for work. As I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I cook rice in my microwavable rice cooker. Then I drop in some frozen peas and cumin seeds to make it real basmati rice, and pack it up with the Tikka Masala chicken for lunch at work. By eating this with rice, you can stretch out the chicken for a whole week of meals. Delicious!

This recipe rocks! Exactly like restaurant style tikka masala! I might sock the chicken in tandoori paste and yogurt next time to experiment more. I would not change a thing about this recipe though! Delicious!

Veggy option!

This was awesome!  I left out the salt because I generally don't cook with salt.  I didn't cook it with chicken, I cooked it with cauliflower and potatoes.  I used about 1/2 a cauliflower and 4 medium sized potates in 1/2" cubes, I boiled them until they were about 1/2 cooked and then drained them and set them aside.  I cooked the sauce as per the instructions, but when it came time to add the chicken, I added the cauliflower and the potatoes and sprinkled the curry over them and put the lid on it for a minute.  After a minute I stirred in the veggies and let it simmer for another 10 minutes until the veggies were cooked and well covered with the sauce.  It was so good.

Very good meal, ate with jasmine rice. I doubled the recipe to make more. Didn't double the onion or garlic though. I chopped one large onion and used dried minced garlic to equal about 6 cloves. Used just regular butter.  I like spice, so I used a small blender to chop 3 habanero peppers and threw those in as well.  Will definitely make again. Might use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil next time.

Delicious!  I used half and half instead of whipping cream because that's what I had on hand.  And used only half the amount of cayenne pepper to suit our taste (well, my daughter and mine; my husband could easily handle more heat).  Was fairly easy and turned out amazing!

Fantastic recipe, thanks for sharing Chris! I made it exactly as written but substituted coconut oil for ghee and vegetable oil, and used coconut milk in place of the heavy whipping cream. It turned out fabulous. I will definitely be adding this to my rotation. Thanks again.

Very good recipe, added some carrot and red pepper, used coconut milk instead of cream as that's what I had on hand.  Whole family enjoyed it.  It's not really much work if you put all our spices together before you start, cut up your chicken, onion and if you add anything else.

This is my first time having chicken tikka masala so I have nothing to compare it to. Also, I didn't have turmeric so I used red curry powder instead. It tasted excellent and I will be making it again, next time with turmeric to see if it makes much of a difference. Also, perfect amount of spice. I love super spicy foods and I wasn't disappointed in the heat.

Very good! I've actually never had traditional tikka Marsala but love this dish! I tripled the cayenne and added a whole minced jalapeño - so it was VERY spicy. Also subbed heavy cream for a whole can on coving milk and did half tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. This made my since a little thinner and more abundant, which I like. Served over rice with fresh naan. I realize now though that this could use some sliced English cucumber on top to add another texture and cook the heat. It's one of those meals you never want to end!

I made this recipe a few days ago and it is AMAZING!! I think it will be something we'll be eating often. As the previous reviews have mentioned, this dish doesn't need any adjustments. It is perfect the way it is. I did not have cream so I substituted half a cup of light cream cheese and had some chilli peppers that needed to be used so I used those instead of Cayenne pepper powder. I always have a hard time making my meat tender and juicy but when making it using the instructions above, they came out PERFECT! I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

Made exactly as recipe is written! No need to change anything  unless you need to turn up or down the heat. As I would have enjoyed I little less my husband would have liked it hotter . All the flavors together are perfect! So glad I found this recipe. We love Indian cuisine. I'm always looking for new recipes for curry and this one is the best I've come across. Will be def making this one again and again and again!

I made this vegan and it's sooooo Good! Used tofu instead of chicken, rice milk instead of cream, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to make it thicker and fresh ginger.

Delicious! The only change  I made was to add more curry powder, we do like a strong curry, so I added a heaped tablespoon. This recipe is definitely a keeper, we had 8 people for supper, and everyone raved about the meal. I made this with saffron rice and naan bread. This will become part of our regular meal rotation. Excellent recipe, thank you!

I cannot get enough of this- it is delicious!  It's pretty hot as the recipe reads, I halved the cayenne.  You can aways add more but you cannot subtract!  I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce instead of the larger.  Had some Garam Masala on hand so I also added a tablespoon of the delicious Indian spice mixture.  Serving with Basmati rice.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't add the cayenne pepper though, and it tasted great regardless. I find we didn't need the extra heat. It wasn't a lot of work to prepare, considering, just needed to use the biggest pot. Made enough for four or five servings.

My wife and I have never tried Indian food before and thought we would give this a shot. We thought this looked like a lot of effort for chicken, but went in with an open mind. We started to get a little concerned as we added cinnamon and the kitchen began to smell sweet. When the dish was done we put it over quinoa and IT WAS AMAZING! We will DEFINITELY be making this again. I didn't adjust the recipe at all and I don't want to, it's awesome. I had some of the leftovers mixed into some white rice and it was just as good the second time around.

Ive made a lot of the recipes on this site and this one, along with the Maine Pumpkin Bread, is the best I've tried. Absolute perfection. And awesome that you can adjust per personal preference. Next time I'm going to add more veggies (peppers,carrots) because we love lots of veg in our food. I wouldn't change the spices - just the right amount of heat. I served this over brown rice and my husband raved about it. Thanks for the great new addition to my rotation:)))

Easy, delicious, and made for adapting to personal tastes.  I cooked the chicken first, and then made the sauce using the drippings in the same pan.  Tossed in several handfuls of baby spinach in the last ten minutes of simmering.  Used about two inches of ginger instead of ground (food processed with the garlic.)  Served over jasmine rice.  This s the second time I've made it, and it's really fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

Have made this a few times.  When dinners are done, I always freeze a good block of this sauce to use in other recipes.  One favorite is to mix it with your favorite hamburger meat and then serve as a sauce on top too.  Great Masala hamburgers as well!

I made it and it was fantastic, I ended up putting a little more cayenne in it but that's just personal taste. other than that the recipe was perfect. Highly recommend it, was easy and fairly fast too.

Delish! I screwed up in using coarse  sea salt and over salted it. I add add some chopped tomatoes and a handful of fresh broccoli cause I needed to use them up, and I enjoyed how it added texturally. Perhaps 1/4 cup chicken broth,  Pinch of Garum  masala and I used Madras curry powder to sauté the chicken in. Used half the sugar, but I would omit next time. Completely delish recipe that is very flexible in making tweaks! One last comment..if I'd had the time, I would have grilled the chicken.

This is my favorite chicken tikka masala recipe ever! It's so easy, so flavorful, and turns out amazing every time.  I share this with all my friends who are wanting to cook Indian for the first time and they always love it too.

This was DIVINE.  Hands down the BEST Tikka Masala I have had.  I will add more cayenne next time but I wanted to follow the recipe to the T for the first attempt so I could see how kid friendly it was.  It had a slight kick but not too spicy for the kiddos.  I will make a separate batch in the future for myself so I can turn up the heat a bit.  I paired this with coconut rice and it was just incredible.  Combination of sweet and spicy, cant go wrong!

Followed the recipe except for substituting olive oil for ghee. My  wife was skeptical while I was cooking but she loved it. Will make again, and serve it to friends with adventurous tastes.  Probably a little to spicy to make for the grandchildren.

Great recipe! This is better than our neighborhood Indian restaurant at a 1/4 of the price--my family was really impressed. I left out the cumin and cut the curry in half. I think next time I'll cut out the cayenne pepper and cut the paprika in half too, as it was a little spicy for my tastes.

I have used this recipe as written so many times because it instantly became a favorite in our house. Just recently I started upping the recipe by marinating the chicken in a plain yogurt and curry mixture before grilling it and then adding it to the sauce. While adding this step certainly isn't necessary, it did bring an extra flavor dimension to the dish that was a huge hit.

Made this recipe exactly how if was written and my whole family loved it! I will be making this again. We no longer need to buy take out from our local Indian restaurant (sorry this is a lot cheaper on my wallet and I know all the ingredients are fresh). The sauce is awesome over basmati rice too. Try it out, you won't regret it, you'll just wish you knew about this recipe earlier.

This was fantastic! I loved that I was able to make this without having to go out and buy any special spices. I had everything on hand. I made a vegan version using cauliflower and carrots in place of the chicken. I also used a can of coconut milk in place of the cream. I prepared everything as directed and added some frozen peas and baby spinach in during the last 7 or 8 minutes. I was blown away by the flavor! I will be making this again and again!

I make recipes from this site all the time, but this is the first I have bothered to review.  Absolutely delicious!  It took some time but was not at all complicated.  The flavors were rich and authentic.  I didn't have ghee, so I used plain butter, and I didn't have cream, so I used half and half.  My husband and I practically licked our plates!

I highly recommend this recipe. My son-in-law is from the U.K. and has had many different types of curry from different places. He agreed that it was amazing. Family loved it. The only thing I did differently, I added a cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon.

This dish is amazing!  It is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I now quadruple the recipe every time I make so that I can have leftovers.  My brother tried it and he raved about it for weeks.  He told me that it tasted like it came from an Indian restaurant.   Now my other siblings want me to make it for them so they can find out what all the fuss is about.  If you like Indian food try this recipe!

It was lacking something in flavor... I added some cardamon and freshly chopped cilantro.  Really good!  I'm going to modify the recipe, and make it "syn free" for Slimming World.  No fat, instead of ghee, some spray olive oil, and substiture the cream with Greek Yoghurt.

If I didn't regularly eat Indian food I might have liked it more than I did. Alas...I do. The sauce is missing something so I increased the amount of salt and tried adding a few drops of lemon juice, but it didn't help. I think it has too much sugar.

This was everything the other reviewers said it was...tasty & delicious with just the right amount of sweet & spicy.  The only change I made was I used regular unsalted butter because I didn't have "ghee."

I made it for 2 but kept the same amount of sauce. Decreased the cayenne to 1 tsp as husband doesn't like to much spice. I thought it was wonderful. Husband doesn't like curry either so he wasn't impressed. I have leftovers for lunch. Served with jasmine rice. Yummy.

Oh wow! this was fantastic! I made a large amount so we'd have leftovers for lunch - that didn't happen! My husband loves a great curry and this certainly hit the spot. It packed a little too much heat for the kids, so I'm thinking I should reduce the cayenne for next time as I think that's where the main heat came from.  Yummy - will be using this again & again... Thanks!

Delicious and authentic tasting.  The only change I made was to use 2 teaspoons of garlic powder instead of cloves, and olive oil instead of clarified butter.  One of my boys found it too spicy, so next time I will reduce the cayenne pepper by half.

I used 22oz of tomato sauce, 1 1/3 cup of cream and an extra chicken breast and didn't reduce the tomato or cream as much as in the video because I wanted more tomato gravy and it was fantastic! Love this recipe, definitely going to make it again very soon.

Doubled well. I made the recipe pretty much as it was listed here, except that I didn't have any turmeric, so it's a little less orange. Really good.

I doubled the recipe (before adding the milk, which was fine substituted for cream) saved half in the freezer. Put it in the crock pot to simmer with milk until we were ready to eat it.

This is so good! My daughter said it was the best thing she's ever eaten! I did change it a bit. I cooked tofu instead of chicken and I added broccoli, carrots and peas. But the sauce is so delicious.

Really good ! Not quite the same as a good Indian restaurant, but close. I marinaded the chicken in plain yogurt, juice of half a lemon and and a teaspoon of curry powder and some salt. Seems like there is maybe something small missing, I can't put my finger on it though, all in all a solid 4 stars, could easily be 5 stars with one small tweak. Very good though

It was milder than expected, but excellent flavor.  I added coconut milk for sweetening which worked well instead of sugar.

I was a tad worried that the spices would be overwhelming but this is so good! I used 1/4 the cayenne and it had plenty of zing. Also, I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because that is all I had and it was great.  Used both chicken and rabbit , served over rice. Yum!

Absolutely amazing!  My husband swears it's better than anything we get at our local Indian restaurant.  The only modification I needed to make was to cut down the cayenne pepper (a little to spicy for my tummy).  Other than that I would not change a thing about this base recipe.  We enjoy adding potatoes to it occasionally or even cauliflower

I love love love masala;!! 
But I'm terrible at following directions. I followed this closely, then decided to use the whole large 28 oz can of tomato sauce and the rest of the coconut cream. Because I adjusted this late in the process, the extra tomato sauce didn't get to cook down its brightness. So I added CASHEW BUTTER!!!!!
Omg. It added the richness depth and warmth!!

The recipe is amazing as is! I made it for the 3rd time tonight and used coconut oil in place of Vegetable oil to brown the chicken. I won't do that again. Follow the recipe to the letter.  Highly recommend prepping everything in advance. Keep an eye on the sauce so it doesn't separate.

This is awesome. My knowledge of tikka masala is next to none. I have never ate it besides trying a mediocre crock pot version on this website. It's a thick and hearty dish that is well balanced between spicy and sweet. I will make this again for sure.

Outrageously outstanding and flavorful!

We substituted vegetable oil for ghee, used double the cayenne pepper to increase the heat and cut up chicken thighs instead of breast so that the chicken is more moist. We also salted the chicken and liberally peppered it with curry powder.

Next time, to try to be slightly healthier, I am going to try only using 1/2 C of heavy whipping cream with 1/2 C of skim milk.

Awesome, made it as per the recipe first time. Loved it :) so made it again using triple everything to freeze and added a bit more cayenne for some more heat.

This was fantastic!   We have a large family of foodies, so I doubled the recipe and EVERYONE went back for seconds!    This sauce would be great with lamb or even tofu.  I used butter instead of ghee, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can stewed tomatoes chopped, and doubled everything.  I didn't have cayenne on hand, so substituted red pepper flakes.  Not too spicy/hot - my 9 yo nephew ate right along with us.   

Made the day ahead due to our work schedules - and put in the oven to warm at 350F in a covered cast iron pot for about 2 hours to heat through.  Paired with basmati rice.   Will definitely make again!

Merry Christmas! We have been sailing for months and are on the last leg and SICK of stir fry at this point. I am a Devine galley chef but had never made mine made masala. Well I used this recipe as a base and tweaked it, making it vegetarian by adding nutritional yeast to the onion and garlic and oil to make butter. I did not have curry powder. When I followed the recipe to a tee aside from the butter I felt it needed a kick so I added some gifted to me from India pre made garam masala I had jarred and a touch more cinnamon and added black pepper. I also used tomato paste adding water and omitting the sugar. As the sauce simmered I added canned garbanzo beans and sweet potatoes that I canned myself and mixed in 1/2 cup of rice to make a masa stew. I really and glad for this recipe because it gave me something to go from. Great job. Thanks for sharing.

This is a very easy recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala.  I generally use another recipe which calls for the chicken to be marinated and grilled, so I use this recipe to save time.  The consistency is very good, but I make mine much more spicy.  I add two serrano chiles including seed that I chop finely and I double at least the cayenne.  I also use a bit more cumin.  But everything else is very good about this recipe.  Makes a lovely sauce.

I have made many versions of chicken tikka masala and this is the quickest/easiest of these and was pretty darn tasty for how little work it was. Some slight variations that I did based on what I had on hand were that I used ginger paste and garlic paste with my onions to shorten the work. This works just fine! I used cumin seed (cooked with my onion mix) because I was out of ground cumin, and I added a squeeze of lemon at the end to add brightness.  These substitutions were just fine and I will probably keep these for next time. I also made a puff onion paratha (bought frozen) and put a tiny bit of rice in it with my chicken tikka masala and ate one like a taco... AND IT WAS AMAZING!!!

I have never commented on a recipe before, but this one deserved it. First time making an indian dish and it came out superbly. I added a little more curry powder to the chicken but other than that I followed the recipes exactly. I will definetely be making this one again.

This is a pretty good approximation of restaurant style Chicken Tikka Masala, and I've made dozens of recipes trying to get as close as possible. I think this one is the best so far. However, I find the instructions needlessly complicated and time-consuming. Instead of cooking the chicken separately, I simply add it and the curry powder to the onion & spices and cook it until it is mostly no longer pink on the outside. Then I add the tomato sauce and other ingredients per the original recipe. After adding the tomato sauce, I find it only needs to simmer for about 15 minutes to fully cook the chicken. After adding the cream, you may have to let it simmer longer to get the right thickness, however. But with this simple change, I find it quicker and easier to make and only have to dirty up one pot! Of course, if you want the full effect you would ideally marinate and bake the chicken in yogurt first, but this recipe is a great shortcut version of this delicious dish.

Excellent.  Made as the recipe calls for.  I might go a little less on the cayenne pepper next time.  Although, the amount of heat did grow on me.

This is seriously SO delicious!!!! I followed the recipe without making any changes except for using chicken thighs, and it turned out perfectly!  It was spicy, but just spicy enough for me!  I will be making this recipe over and over again when I'm in the mood for Chicken Tikka Masala (served with Basmati Rice).  Loved it!

I went through a phase a few years ago where I tried to replicate restaurant-style chicken tikka masala. It always had too much tomato, or too much spice . . . never quite right. I made this last night as written, and yes! Seriously good. My arteries were screaming when I dumped in that entire cup of heavy cream, but that's what makes it 'authentic.' Next time I might try chicken thighs, since breast tends to get dry, but I will definitely be making this one again. One note: I love spicy food, and it was perfect for me, but my husband thought it was a little too spicy. Might want to back off on the cayenne a bit if you are heat-shy. Oh, I did throw in some frozen peas . . . that was a nice addition.

I only use two breasts, and keep the other portions the same. It creates a lot of sauce so my wife and I can sop up with naan and basmati rice very good recipe, lots of flavors all at once but I guess thats what  Indian cooking is about.

OMG. This is what Chicken Tikka Masala tastes like. This stuff is crack! LOL This is the best recipe for this dish I have ever found. I made this exactly by the Recipe to a "T " tonight for dinner. Everyone practically licked their plates and there are no left-overs! The combination of spices is perfect. You don't need to adjust anything. I don't think our local Indian restaurants I go to around here could ever get this dish to be this good! This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe when I'm craving Chicken Tikka Masala.  I served it with Basmati Rice and a side of Palak Paneer. I also cheated and bought some frozen Naan bread from Trader Joe's to mop up the delicious sauce at the end. Heaven on a plate!

This is so delicious! I love it! My very minor changes: I used chickpeas instead of chicken, so I just put the curry powder in with the Paprika and Sugar, and then added the chickpeas in step 3, simmering another 15 minutes.  Also, I was lazy and put my onion in the food processor. Since I had no idea what size onion to use, I did about 2/3 cup of very finely chopped onion. And personal taste, I would reduce the cayenne a bit since I'm a spice wuss. But it's still really fantastic.

I've made this a couple of times and it is fool proof. We are tiki-masala fans and this is delicious. I left out the sugar and it still tastes amazing.  It is a little bit of work if making with basmati rice at the same time.  I like cooking The chicken ahead of time.

I cut the cayenne pepper in half, which made it just about right for us; may heat it up a bit more next time. I lived in England for a while and this recipe was exactly the way I remember the curry---- delish! Thank you so much! It was better than anything I've had back here in the USA.

Wow! This was incredible. The few revisions I made...used "Hot" Paprika and a Tablespoon of Cayenne.  This was fantastic. My GF eats Tikka Masala quite a bit and said this was the best she has ever had. TY for this:-)

Delicious! Didn't have cream so I used canned coconut milk and a bit of unsweetened coconut/ almond milk blend (from the carton).

I did modify this to be vegan friendly by subbing firm tofu and a third of a can of coconut cream, but the spice balance in this cannot be beaten! I served it with cumin jasmine rice and glazed ginger lime carrots. It was a hit with my husband and ten year old daughter.

Great recipe! Followed along as written but took advice from those who used garam masala and a little extra chili. I added the garam masala to this curry. We also used chicken thighs instead of breasts (this is typical for us) and threw frozen peas in at the end. The color wasn't really orange - more red - but the flavor was spot on! We subbed coconut milk for heavy cream and used the extra to make vegan ice cream (with bananas, pumpkin & maple syrup) for dessert. We served the dish with store-bought naan. Can't wait to make it again!

Love it!  British family loved it!  Second time I made it though I did cut the cayenne in half because I had tears the first time at full strength - in no way a reflection of the recipe though!!!  This is really really good!!!!!

Made the recipe as written with coconut rice and naan. It turned out delicious. It had a depth of spice without being overpowering. I was surprised that even my husband enjoyed it! Will make again!

My man is a huge fan of chicken Tikka Masala and I tried several different recipes and it's the only one that really reflects the one  he loves, the real one! and no difficulty.
I just added a bit of chilli pepper :)

This was amazing. Boyfriend loved it. Made the entire thing as written, didn't add extra sugar or salt because it tasted perfect as is. Served with couscous, and wished I had naan bread too. Absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

A lot of ingredients and think next time I'll skip making the Ghee and just use unsalted butter like I do with everything else. The meal was delicious and have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow!

This recipe was amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and served the curry over white rice.  Instead of chicken breasts, I removed the skin and de-boned chicken thighs and they worked wonderfully.  My husband grew up in India and said this was the best dish I've ever made.  I plan to make this many times in the future.

Converted the recipe to the slow-cooker--will definitely make again!!  Just put all the ingredients straight into the slow cooker (except dairy), using chicken thighs and legs.  Cooked on high for 4 hours, served to my husband's work team--they LOVED it!!  Only small tweaks to the recipe, as follows:  added 1/2 can of dark beer to slow cooker and a handful of peanuts (I like the contrasting crunch in the recipe).  About 30 minutes before serving, I turned the cooker to low and added 1/2 a cup of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of cream.  Stir it in and let heat through.  Delish!!

I typically do not  eat a lot of Indian food but a friend had said he orders Tikka Masala  often when dining out  and loved it. So I decided to try some homemade rather than ordering it at a restaurant and being disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the cayenne pepper by about 1/2. I figured I could always add more if needed but  my wife and I think the reduced cayenne worked out great for us.  
The final results were amazingly good and I will be making this dish often.

This recipe was on point! My husband never had any Indian food before, and I was worried that he wouldn't like it because it is nothing he's used to, but he loved it! I was extremely pleased with this recipe, I did almost everything exact, except I put a little less of the suggested amount of ground cumin because I'm not a huge fan of it. I also cubed some potatoes and boiled it and it was a great addition. This will definitely be made again!

The taste of this dish is devine. Totally addictive and so far better than anything I can get from local restaurants in central PA. I cut the cayenne in half because I am a heat whip but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.

Must try this!  I've never had tikka masala and neither have my kids - we all LOVED this recipe!!  The only change I made was reducing the cayenne by half and it was just enough spice for us. My kids asked for seconds and I can see that there would be nothing terrible about doubling the sauce - YUMMY over brown rice. And excellent leftovers. I'll toy with reducing the fat content but this is definitely a keeper.

I didn't have cumin so I added a TBL of Garam Masala and then a neighbor came to the rescue and I added the TBL of cumin late and OH MY GOSH!!! I've made the recipe exactly as it is and it is 5 stars!! But add that Garam Masala (it's a lot of the same spices but a few that aren't on the ingredients list) and BAM! 10 stars!!! I'm making it right now...my mouth is watering...

This was a great recipe.  I did things a little out of order.  I sauteed the onions with butter, then added the garlic.  Then I added in cumin, salt, ginger paste, cayenne, cinnamon, and tumeric.  In a slowcook, I mixed in the tomato sauce, paprika, sugar, and onion/garlic mixture.  I only had drumsticks at home so I cut off the meat and tossed it with curry powder.  Once cooked, I added it to the crockpot and kept on high for about 45 mins to get the chicken more tender.  For the last 15 mins, I took off the lid of the crockpot and added in the half and half(substituted) plus another tablespoon of curry powder.  Then garnished with cilantro. Yum!!!!  Thank you for posting this recipe.

What an awesome dish. First attempt at making an Indian dish and this recipe nailed it with no changes. I want to look over the changes that others have suggested and maybe try those, but I'm seriously afraid it will screw it up. Made this about a week and a half ago, making it again tonight!

I've never written a review before but feel compelled to for this recipe. This is amazing! I've been looking for years for a recipe that even comes close to a beloved Tikka Masala from a local restaurant, and I finally found it. The only changes I made were 1. added fenugreek seeds  to the onion spice mixture (leaves would work too, just added later) and 2. Doubled the sauce (personal preference). If you can find the fenugreek...it's hard to come by...you won't be disappointed. Thanks for posting this, it's my new favorite recipe!

Ok, so it seems almost silly to add yet another review to a recipe that is obviously AMAZING, but I couldn't resist....WOW,  this is great! while I am completely sure this would be perfect as written I had to make some minor changes as I didn't have chicken breasts on hand. I doubled the recipe, and cut up a whole chicken (both cubes and drumsticks/wings) after frying them in a pan I put the bigger pieces e.g drumsticks/wings in the oven to make sure they would be cooked and then I put them all in the sauce to cook. I also added a lot more curry and omitted the sugar. Serve over rice. I wouldn't change a thing!

I doubled the recipe and served it over jasmine rice -- absolute ambrosia.  I also upped the amount of cayan by 50% ... just enough.  Definitely spicy but not destructive!   This is the first time I have tried to make a Tikka Masala myself, it was surprisingly easy.   I used skinless boneless chicken tenderloins for the chicken.    I am hooked!

Delicious!  I didn't change or omit anything, except for the optional salt and sugar at the very end which was omitted.  My boyfriend and I both loved this!

This was so easy to make, and a hit at the dinner table as well.  I used spices that I had never used before and opened a door I plan to leave open. I followed the recipe exactly, and WA surprised how wonderful the sauce was. It was difficult not to over taste it. The only change I would recommend is to cut the chicken up and put back in the sauce before serving.   This is what I did with the leftovers, and I enjoyed it even more. Needless to say,  I'll be making this again.

Get out of town, I made this pretty much exactly as stated and it's so good! I'm a weeny when it comes to spice so I added a little sugar at the end and didn't cook the chicken in anything but the oil. I have a huge grin on my face and a lot of stains on my shirt, which is my way of saying, "Dinner rocked!"

This was just like the Tikka Masala we order at our local Indian restaurant!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was delicious!  We will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was delicious! The only things I did differently was I used smoked paprika and added about 1/2 a pint of grape tomatoes sliced in half.

My favorite curry sauce! I have made the sauce only, without adding the chicken and I can use it with rice and lamb. It is delicious!

I added more cayenne (as one reviewer suggested) and it was too hot. Next time I'll make it as directed I found another recipe that recommended marinating the chicken in a yogurt and spice mixture which was awesome. I broiled the chicken as another reviewer did (because we ran out of propane) and it was great. Will definitely make this again.

Made this last night for dinner, following the recipe exactly as written, as I always do my first time trying a new recipe. OUTSTANDING!! I did not feel that there was too much heat. In fact, I will up the cayenne next time I make it because I enjoy spicy food. If you love tikka masala from a restaurant you will love this recipe. Served this with naan (recipe from this site) and basmati rice. Better than take out. Would give 10 stars if I could.

I never review anything, but this was so phenomenal, I just had to!!! I would rate it 6 stars if I could. This beats what my local Indian joint is serving, hands down! Followed recipe to the letter and its perfect in every way. I will be making this on a weekly basis. My wife and I are completely blown away!

We used a can of goya coconut milk instead of heavy cream, a little more fresh minced garlic than called for and some more cayenne pepper than called for as well... I stirred and stirred, just like the recipe instructed... the end result turned out wonderful! I like spicy and strong aromatic flavors when I eat Indian food, and this recipe definitely mastered something that seemed previously difficult to perfect. 
I really like highly spicy dishes, and mine turned out almost too spicy so don't underestimate the cayenne pepper!

This recipe was BOMB.COM LOL I made a few changes to deal with what I had. I used skinless Chicken thighs, fresh ginger(more than required because I Love ginger) added cumin seeds with the onions, added some chick peas(once almost done)and coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  Also made some chapati to sop up that gravey! My babies ate it up!

OMG, soooo delish! I was a little concerned when I started cooking it because it smelled a little sweet, but it turned out sooo good and not sweet at all! It's SO flavor-filled and my husband said it's the equivalent of our local favorite Indian restaurant! I did cut the cayenne pepper in 1/2, only because my husband really doesn't like spicy foods, and after ulcers I just can't eat it anymore. Definitely putting this in my permanent recipe book and making again and again! Yum!

Love the recipe. 

I have family members who can't eat spicy food, so I did half or a fourth of what the author said to put as spices. 

I also have started using COCONUT MILK instead of whipping cream.

I have made this several times and my wife loves it. We have eaten it with rice and noodles and I like noodles best. I'm meeting my shrimp guy that comes up from Louisiana in an hour and making this with shrimp tonight, good stuff!

This recipe truly makes the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. I don't need to go to a restaurant anymore--I can make it right at home! I did make two changes to the recipe--I used chicken tenderloins (...they're more tender than breast), and I used hot curry powder and doubled it from 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon. The family loved it, and it tastes great with some warm tandoori naan. I will definitely be making this again.

This was first time having chicken curry and I loved it . I didn't  use clarified butter but used olive oil instead. Everything else exactly as printed. Husband said maybe a little less cayenne but I disagree. Awesome recipe thank you.

I decided to try 3 different recipes,  this one, Chef John's and another one off the back of a Tikka Masala curry mix packet.  Fair to say the place smelt like an Indian curry house while cooking all three at once!  This recipe was the winner with Chef John's coming in second.  The commercial curry mix recipe was well behind the other two.   The only change I made was to substitute the cream with coconut yogurt (a little bit of Mango made it in too as it was a CoYo yogurt with Mango sauce).   I will definitely make this again.

Wow this is good!  Better than any Indian restaurant I have eaten in. Rich, full of flavor, a balanced amount of heat without overpowering the taste of the dish.   Followed the recipe with the following minor exceptions:  I used just regular butter instead of ghee, 2 tspn of sugar instead of 1 TBS.  It didn't need any adjustment when finished cooking.   So glad that I can now have one of my favorite dishes at home anytime that I want!!

Excellent recipe.  Chronic recipe modifiers (like me) should give this one a go as written.  Take the time to make ghee!  As author noted, if you like heat, you'll need to kick up the cayenne pepper. I serve over basmati rice or with naan.  A fresh cucumber salad is a nice compliment.

This was great; I think I finally found my "keeper" recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala. I doubled the recipe and added garam masala and ground coriander. I used 1/2 cayenne and 1/2 chili powder (so it wouldn't be too spicy for the family), a combo of tomato puree, paste, and sauce, and omitted the sugar. I didn't have heavy cream so I used a can of evaporated milk and some half-and-half. Also, I cooked the chicken (I used boneless skinless thighs) in the pot before starting the sauce and set it aside until I needed it, so that I wouldn't have two pots to clean. Thank you!

I'm making this tonight for probably the 7th or 8th time. It is time-consuming, but delicious. We pour it over basmati rice and top with fresh cilantro from the garden. It is just about as good as it gets. A real keeper!

I found this reminded me of a sort of spicy chicken paprika; it had so much of it. I didn't properly reduce the sauce, to make it thick, so I could do that better. I might try coconut milk since I find I'm lactose intolerant.  Otherwise very savory will repeat.

This is our absolute favorite dish!  I recommend to follow the recipe exactly.  Don't marinate the chicken beforehand, it will mess up the wonderful flavors that are intended. I preach to follow the recipe exactly, but I can't bring myself to use heavy whipping cream, I use coconut cream instead. Good Heavens this dish is soooo good!

This was great! This is the first Indian dish I have ever eaten, and I tried it out of curiosity, and am glad I did. It is very spicy and heavy though, both make it hard to eat much. I used 1/2t cayenne the second time and will use even less next time. I may also use coconut milk instead of heavy cream next time to make it not so heavy. I used the extra 1/2t salt and 1t sugar and made the chicken with the onion and blooming spices, including the curry powder, as separating them seemed pointless. Also, the 'healthier version' with tomato paste and half & half does not work, unfortunately.

My whole family will eat this. Not a mean feat with the 6 picky eaters that we have. I have even tried plenty of substitutions, and they will still eat it. Just make sure to saute the spices before adding everything else, otherwise the sauce turns out gritty.

Made with the naan II recipe from allrecipes.com. It was wonderful. I made it very mild and only put a pinch of cayenne in, but everything else was just as the recipe suggested.

Chicken Tikka is one of my favorite dishes in the Indian cuisine. I always wondered how to make it, and always thought it would be too complicated with difficult to find ingredients. Until I saw this recipe. I tried, and OMG, it is amazing!!! Better than many Indian restaurants I've been to. I give it a 5 stars, would not change a thing. It is perfect the way it is.  Served it over basmati rice and garlic naan.

Pretty darn good.  Didn't blow us away, but definitely worth making again.  One downside was that it was missing oomph for me, a vegetarian, when I pulled out my sauce before the chicken went in.  I added curry powder and let it simmer longer, but next time I will try adding a little Better than Bullion chicken-free broth paste to see if that helps.

I didn't want to give  it five stars as I made a couple of changes, but if the original recipe taste as good as it did with changes it should get five stars.
First change was that I didn't worry about having Ghee. I just used butter. I added a whole (slightly heaping) teaspoon of cinnamon (because I love it). I doubled the Turmeric, and I used coconut milk instead of cream. 
I also mixed in chick peas and lentils when I added the chicken, and I did less then half of the Cayenne (glad I did as it was plenty warm) and doubled the curry.
It was yummy. Thanks for the recipe. very easy to make.

I thought the sauce was delicious! It's a little spicy for those that can't handle spice. We did a combo of coconut milk and cream for the cream. We also added a bag of broccoli making it even yummier.

I browned the chicken first, deglazed the pan with a little water and followed the recipe to the letter thereafter. Could not tell the difference. I made it last week, followed the recipe...It was such a huge hit my husband...who doesn't like anything with curry has been asking for it all weekend.  I served it both times with brown rice sprinkled with fresh finely chopped Italian parsley and cilantro. YUMMY

This recipe was super awesome. I made it as prescribed, except that I put the curry into the sauce rather than on the chicken. It was so much better than a lot of the Tikka Masala I get from Indian restaurants.

We are not big eaters, usually, but I always have to make a double batch of this! The kids love it (even when I use the hot madras curry).

I have made this recipe countless times now, and everyone I cook it for always raves about it. I usually substitute half and half for the heavy cream, but of course it is better with the heavy whipping cream. :-)

Seriously perfect. This is a recipe I'll be making for the rest of my life. The only thing I'd change is adding vegetables to it, but that's just because I really like vegetables (:

This was amazing! I was looking for healthy chicken recipes (or recipes I could modify to make healthy) when I stumbled upon this.   I substituted Greek non-fat yogurt for the heavy cream, left out the sugar, used just a bit of olive oil for the sauteing of the onions and the garlic, and baked rather than fried the chicken before adding it to simmer in the sauce. I only had 1 small can of tomato sauce so I took the advice of another reviewer and used a small can of tomato paste as well and added a bit of water. Worked great. I served it over cauliflower "rice" with a bit of fresh minced ginger and curry mixed in. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely be making again. Many times.

This is so good ! My only change , mostly  by accident - I put curry in the original spice mixture . I also used roasted garlic onion spaghetti sauce by hunts instead of tomato sauce . I make my own ghee - not that hard , google it . Serve w basamati rice ! Yumm

Fantastic recipe, I've enjoyed making this several times now.  I use a touch more curry but that's the only adjustment made and its one based solely on preference not necessity.

I'm not much of a review kind of person but I have to say this was SO absolutely delicious, I had to write one.  I love Indian food and this was easy, cheap and fantastic.  Tasted just like my favorite Indian Restaurant.  Hats off to the poster/creator of this recipe.  I'll be making it again and again.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. :) For years, I have been looking for a recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala that was simple and yet as good as a restaurant. This recipe has exceeded my expectations! Quite easy to make, and THE BEST TASTING Chicken Tikka I've ever had!

LOVE this recipe! It is one of our favorite things to make/eat. I have made it many times but I finally doubled it when made it last night and it is perfect! I have used any kind of butter (salted or unsalted) and it has been fine.  I add peas and maybe one small red potato. Yum, yum, yum!!

We love Indian food so I've used several recipes for chicken tikka masala over the years, but this was by far one of the easiest and most delicious ones I've tried! The only changes I made was using a 1:1 ratio with garlic and fresh ginger (rather than powdered) which I made into a paste, adding a teaspoon of coriander powder, and lastly, because we like heat, some small chilies which I slit, but left the stems on so they can be fished out before serving, and doubled the curry powder when cooking the chicken. I served this with come cumin infused rice and garlic naan...FABULOUS! As others have mentioned, it really saves time and stress if you go ahead and measure all your spices out before you start cooking and place them in a small bowl which you can simply dump in when your onion/garlic mixture is ready.

This is an outstanding recipe! I didn’t have the patience to make the ghee so I just used regular butter and it was perfection. The entire dish (with the chicken) freezes very well. Next time, I will follow the poster’s own advice and make a double batch of just the sauce to freeze to have on hand. I am looking forward to using this sauce for a veggie version with paneer. My husband is just looking forward to me making this again.

Amazing! I used extra curry powder (about a tablespoon) split between the chicken and in the sauce, but I love curry powder. Also I used the ground ginger that comes in the squeeze tube and minced ginger from a jar. I keep both on hand as a staple for recipes and it cuts down on prep time and allows me to keep all ingredients (except the cream) on hand for when the Indian food cravings strike. Next time I'll cook up the chicken first and set aside as my preference is one pan cooking,m. Great recipe and it looks daunting but the effort and time is completely worth it with a perfectly fulfilling reward!

Delicious and simple.  I tasted the sauce before adding the chicken, and while the heat was just right for me I knew it would be a bit much for one of  my guests, so I added about 1/4 cup extra cream.  (If that guest had not been coming over, I wouldn't have changed a thing.)  I'll definitely be making this one again.  EDIT: I've made this several times now, with great success .   My husband & I like lots of sauce, so I've started adding 1/2 cup of coconut milk with the cream.  Delicious!

My neighbors are from India and they cooked me so many foods from what they grew up with, and when they moved I never got the chance to grab the recipe from them and this is the closest recipe I could get to the chicken curry and I love it!

This recipe taste good but It's not spicy enough(for us).  That said, It's fine the way it's written & my stars given r based on that. Not the extra tweeks we gave it! We use xtra hot curry on the chicken and extra cayenne pepper. We first marinate the chicken in a yogurt/lemon juice mix. This recipe is missing gram masala & red chili powder. Using heavy cream is a must. Important... Don't forget to top it with chopped coriander. We make it with homemade naan bread, and with a small glass of cucumber drink. (Cools and cleans the palate). But on its own it's a great recipe.

I love this recipe.  I make it pretty much as listed, however I like to add Garbanzo beans to the mixture and put it over Jasmine rice.  We eat the dish with Tandoori Naan bread and it is always delicious!

This is DELICIOUS!  I did made a couple of changes because I know how my tastes run.   I used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cayenne and am glad I reduced both of those items as the heat was perfect for me.  I also didn't have any heavy cream or ghee so I substituted 3/4 cup whole milk and 1/4 cup half-and-half and used butter in place of ghee.  It is seriously so good!

Very similar to chicken tikka masala that I have had at Indian restaurants.   It was easy to make and I had all the ingredients in the cupboard. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again. 
Thanks

My boyfriend & I make this once a week! Once you have the spices & whatever protein (we use fried tofu), you only need to buy the tomato sauce & whopping cream. Served over rice this is a cost effective, filling, delicious & complex dish. We have searched for that perfect tikka masala recipe & finally found it. Chris you are a lifesaver!  :) totally worth trying, but be ready to be hooked!

Wow, this came out so yummy! It really tasted like curry you get from a restaurant. (I think) I changed a few things only because I didn't have them on hand and didn't feel like loading up the kid to go to the store. I used coconut oil (what a good choice) instead of the ghee. Also, I didn't have the curry powder so I left that out. Other than that I followed the recipe and it came out delicious. I would love to make it again and use the curry powder. Although, I would use the coconut oil again, it gave it a good flavor.

Fantastic.  Only a couple changes:
-used regular butter instead of ghee (I was lazy)
-omitted cayenne
-instead of cooking chicken, I just added some frozen turkey meatballs (organic) and some frozen roasted cauliflower.  

Paired with the garlic naan recipe on this site.  Rave reviews.  My kids ate cauliflower.  WIN.

This recipe tastes as good as the local Indian restaurant. I will definitely make this again. 

I made only one change - after following the recipe exactly and tasting it,  I thought it needed just a little more curry powder so I added an additional 1/2 tsp. 

I think it is important to be organized prior to starting because there are quite a few ingredients. I added the spices to a bowl in the order they were needed so they were ready to go as I was cooking. I can't imagine having to measure all of them while trying to cook at the same time. 

This recipe was worth the effort. It was truly fantastic!

Very good recipe! Chicken turned out super tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  I added fresh cilantro, it really complimented the flavor. I also used coconut oil in place of the ghee.

This recipe is fantastic to introduce someone to Indian food. Sweet, aromatic and a delight to eat. I used 1/2 tbs more of sugar and used smoked paprika. I like a thicker sauce so I simmered the base a few minutes longer. I also substituted rice for quinoa.

My family looooved this!  My dad (who usually eats out for lunch) even called dibs on some of the leftovers for tomorrow.  I'll be sharing the recipe with my mom so she can add it to the family dinner rotation when I go back to school.

Perfect!  My family loved just the right amount of heat.  We served the chicken with rice and green peas - next will get some naan for a perfect Indian-ish dinner.

Marvelous!

For a less 'British' version, do not include sugar and at least double the spices, especially the cayenne.

This recipe is better than the pre-made store bought sauces I had been using. I made a double batch following the recipe, then tweaked the cayenne and curry until it suited my taste. The family loved it - no more store bought for us!!

For my first attempt at Indian cuisine, this was absolutely fantastic!  Better than I could have expected.  - 12/2015
     
I had Mom and Dad visiting, and I wanted to make something new for them.  Mom has dairy allergies.  So, I substituted olive oil (not EVO) for the ghee and substituted coconut milk for the heavy whipping cream.  It was terrific.  I served it over jasmine rice.  Mom and Dad loved it!  - 7/2016
       
BTW, I love it spiciness that the 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper gives the recipe.  But, parents, girlfriend and daughter can’t handle it.  I cut it to half a teaspoon and it still has a nice bite and the rest of the wimps can handle it too.  -8/2016

Followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious. Great flavors and combinations of spices. I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was perfect. Great for a dinner party or dinner with the family. I served it with brown basmati rice. Yum yum.

This is absolutely the best and most delicious tikka I have ever had! I've tried many, many recipes and some self invented creations but this recipe is now our family's favourite. We make it at least once a month. Thanks for sharing this.

We love this!  And we are pretty picky about our tikka masala.  I didn't have any cream, so I used 2% milk and greek yogurt; still came out great.  I also added garam masala.  For me, the teaspoon of cayenne is way too hot, but I'm a lightweight.  This is really flavorful, with a great balance of tang, warm spice, and heat.

This chicken dish is a regular menu item in our house. My children and I adore Indian food. The exotic flavors of the garam masala make the ease of this recipe deceiving...it seems like we would have been in the kitchen for hours instead of just 30 minutes. If you are looking for rich flavors, I cannot recommend his recipe highly enough.

First time I've ever loved a recipe so much "as is" that I felt compelled to write a review.  Indian food intimidated me for years.  I still have only gone to one Indian restaurant and despite all the options on the buffet, Chicken Tikka Masala is always my preferred main dish.  I made this dish tonight and served with Basmati Rice (this is essential).  It was incredible.  Seriously.  My husband and I loved it so much.  We both had seconds and agreed that this dish will be in our regular rotation.  No adjustments needed - it's perfect just the way it's written.  Enjoy!

Wow! That Was just superb! Better than the Indian Pakistani restaurant around the corner.  And I love those masalas. 
And I made it even more simple by adding the chicken right in after the spices. 
Otherwise the recipe is spot on!
Guten Appetit! ;)

Ridiculously delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly as written and my family and I LOVED it.  I doubled the recipe (just for the record it turned out to be just under 5 cups total in diced chicken I used for a double batch and that seemed to be a good ratio of chicken to sauce.  I like plenty of sauce and this ratio seemed to be just about right.  Served over rice with Naan bread.....YUMMY!!!!

I have been looking at tikka masala recipes for a bit now. When I read these reviews, I decided this was the one to try. This was excellent!  Easy to cook and so rewarding to eat. This is as tasty as I have had at restaurants and even better than some.  
I have made this more than 10 times and these are my final adjustments:
I used the same amount of chicken, doubled all the ingredients (because I love a lot of sauce) and halved the cayenne and paprika.  I like hot, but that was too hot. I sprinkled another 1/2 tbsp of curry powder on the chicken as well.

This is amazing. Really, really amazing. We loooove Indian food, but eating out is not always an option for us. This recipe is perfect. I did quarter the cayenne--but it could use a little bit more heat. Really though, this recipe is wonderful!

This is, hands down, my favorite recipe on this site. I've made this several times, but sometimes it appears curdled after adding the cream. I haven't been paying close enough attention, but sometimes I only have half and half on hand, and that may be causing the problem. The first time I made it  I followed this recipe to a T (aside from sprinkling a little extra curry powder on the chicken) and it turned out wonderfully.

This rocks. I live in the UK so had to substitute pasata for tomato sauce. I did it weight for weight and it is tasty.

It was the first time I made something like this. I've eaten it once at a little curry stand in London and this tasted exactly alike! I've not been able to find something similiar in Germany yet and was really happy to find this. Bonus was learning new words for spices, I had to google quite a few, because I didn't know the words!^^ Would recommend any time and will definitely become one of my standard dishes as it is easy and scrumptious. I only left the sugar out, because I prefer it a bit more savoury.

Let me start out by saying I have never had Chicken Tikka Masala nor have I ever made it so I truly had nothing to compare it to ....But I must say it is Wonderful! Wow! So flavorful! I was a bit worried about all the spices im not used to cooking with them but after one bite I was sold lol Pure Deliciousness...I did have to make a change I had no cream so I did have to use greek coconut yogurt im not sure if it makes a huge difference in taste if using the heavy cream but  it sure was the BOMB!

This recipe is awesome! I love this dish from restaurants, and I've tried a couple pre made sauces (either an envelope that you mix or a "simmer sauce") - none of them were quite right. The sugar is the key to that sweet creamy curry that I love so much. I love spicy food, but I did use less cayenne and less salt. My kids gobbled it up and begged for more. My only addition was some fresh chopped cilantro sprinkled in at the end and a squeeze of lemon in the sauce.

I have tried so many recipes and this is hands down the closest thing we can get to authentic Indian restaurant Tikka Masala. I make it at least twice per month, and double the sauce each time.

had a lot of people and not enough chicken, so i added one can of chick peas, one of red lentils, fresh mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, and zuccini  squash(HUGE HIT!!) to a double batch of this killer sauce ( also amped up the Ceyanne pepper 50%) and added a good squirt of sirracha  since we like it spicy, but i tell ya.... the local indian restaurant  has NOTHING on this recipe!!

Da bomb. To make it kosher, I use full fat coconut milk (cannot mix meat and dairy) - and even still it rocks (and yes, I've had the real deal)! Also consider it is lower fat and not a gut bomb... I always double everything, so two cans of tomato sauce and one can of coconut milk. This dish gets better as it ages - I made it Thursday, served Friday and leftovers on Saturday were even better. I love serving it with roasted cauliflower and smothering it in any leftover sauce. Just fab...

This recipe was a success. Even though I forgot to add ginger it was still great. My Indian boyfriend said it tasted good. And he's a picker eater. I will make again but I won't use chicken. I'll make it with potatoes.

I really liked this recipe and hubby too. The level of spicy is good but I would still next time tweak it a bit so it is a tid bit less spicy. I do not mean the heat was bad not at all. It is just to my taste and for the sake of my innards I would like to experiment with this recipe using less of each of the spices to see if I can get it to be "just right" to my taste but as an overall this is gooood! Try it you won't be disappointed.
EDIT: Important! Just like someone mentioned this recipe is extremely close if not exactly the same in taste like the one we get at our nearby. restaurant!

Followed this recipe exactly except for the clarified butter - I substituted with regular butter instead. So delicious! Couldn't get any better, no changes needed. This will save me money on Indian takeout in the future!

Brilliant recipe! I do change a few things to make things easier though!! I add a couple of tablespoons of curry powder and 2 T of sugar because I don't cook the chicken. I buy a pre cooked roasted or rotisserie chicken, cut the meat up and put it in the sauce close to the end, after the cream has been added. I cool and refrigerate for at least one night for the chicken to absorb the flavors. 
All my friends think that I should can or bottle it, sell it to our local grocery store and make my fortune!!!!

Exactly what I was looking for! Tastes even better than my favorite local Indian restaurant. Substituted potatoes for chicken to keep vegetarian. I was really happy how it turned out using potatoes. Boiled them until tender and then sauted them with the spices just as you would the chicken. Only continued cooking for about 10 min after adding to sauce since potatoes were already cooked. I'd like to try cauliflower in place of the chicken, next time and see how that turns out.

Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I have made this dish in batches a few times before, and everyone always loves it. It's not fancy or pretty, but it's filling and it's tasty! I modified the recipe a tiny bit - I only use 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon paprika to make it more mild. I also use regular salted butter instead of ghee. You could probably get away with using whipping cream as opposed to heavy whipping cream - it just serves to make it creamier and smoother, so both would do the job. All other ingredients remain the same! 

I love making this for cozy at-home meals, and we freeze it to have as a quick and easy meal for those nights when we come home late from work. It's a very easy dish to make as a beginner!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  It has become a staple in our house and is not really that much work after you have run through the recipe a couple of times.  Measuring is very important because the ratio of spies make a big difference! The only changes I make is to cook the chicken in the own first so that the curry incorporates into the sauce more and I have one less pan to clean.

Wanted to find an awesome recipe using chicken breast, so I just Googled recipe using chicken breast & this recipe was the first one on the list. So with all the reviews, I wanted to see what the hype was about & I'm so happy I did!! Recipe comes very close to authentic chicken masala  from an Indian restaurant. But importantly I instantly gained brownie points for cooking this recipe as it is my hubby's favorite Indian dish!! Thanks for the share.

This was so good!  I will definitely make it again soon. I pretty much followed the recipe except a few small changes. I subbed coconut milk for the cream to make it a bit healthier and roasted the chicken with a tandoori spice rub. (I didn't add the chicken to the sauce so I added the curry powder with the rest of the spices). It was a touch salty so I'll reduce the salt to probably 1/2 tsp next time. Also, it was a little sweet but that was probably the coconut milk. Overall, an excellent recipe!

This was so good! I told my mate that I may never cook again, just so I could go out on top! I followed the directions except, I excluded the tameric because I had none in my pantry and subbed gram masalla. Also subbed cream cheese for the heavy cream, to save calories. We both agreed that it was as good as we have ever had. I wished I had two stomachs. Really. Can't wait for the leftovers.

Oh my GOD! I NEVER review recipes but this is amazing. This was my fourth attempt making Masala Sauce and I've finally found the perfect recipe (after all of the others turned out like a spicy tomato sauce). This tastes almost like the one served at my local Indian restaurant, which will definitely save me money. They do add red bell peppers, so I added a half of one and it really helped the flavor. I also blended it into a luxurious, smooth sauce. I would also try with coconut milk to improve the nutrition factor. I will be making naan and putting this over brown sprouted basmati rice. Very very impressed! One quick note, this is a little spicy. I would start with a little cayenne and add more according to your personal taste.

The main picture doesn't do this justice! Better than a lot of restaurants if you tweak a bit. Boneless skinless thighs are better but I have also done it with breasts chopped up and marinated in yogurt and spices. The 1 cup of heavy cream is totally unnecessary. I usually do a half cup in portions. Do not be scared to add extra fresh ginger, cumin and curry powder-- you will only enhance the flavor.

Excellent, excellent flavor.  Chicken was so tender.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more curry to the sauce and some extra cayenne pepper as my family loves spice and heat!

OMG, I have been searching for a restaurant style tikka masala, and this is it!! This tasted exactly like my favorite fast food indian place, and I was so impressed that I made it myself. To make it slightly healthier, I used light butter instead of ghee, and as one reader had suggested, I substituted fat free half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. I also cut out the vegetable oil, and used olive oil spray to cook the chicken. It still came out exactly the same as what I had hoped for! Still have all of the ingredients (minus the chicken), so will be making this again tonight.

I made this last night for a party.  It's amazing and everyone loved it!  I did sub half and half in for the heavy cream and let everything burble a little bit longer to thicken things up.  This is a total keeper.

This curry is a-MAZING!!  so easy, so delicious, so satisfying without having to go to Brick Lane in London--we've already had this twice this week!  If you want to make the sauce separately in big batches for freezing, the directions are perfect.  For lazy one-pot-only cooks like me, just brown the chicken with the onion in the ghee and carry on as directed.  I ran out of heavy cream so substituted plain yogurt and that's awesome too!!  Thank you so much for this answer to our curry prayers!!!!

Wow!! This recipe was great. I had to add 1/2 cup milk because it was a little too spicy and I let it cook down. Also, thought I had turmeric but didn't. I used paprika instead and added parsley flakes as well.
Not a big fan of curry but the combination of spices makes it taste great. Thank you for giving my chicken a new flair!!

We made this recipe tonight and everybody liked it, even the children.  Although I should mention that we left out the cayenne and passed sriracha at the table (for the adults).  The chicken was tender and moist and the sauce was yummy!  We did use cream, like the recipe asks for, but another time, maybe I'll try it with coconut milk (as I see others either did or are thinking of doing too). We followed the seasonings (except for the cayenne) to the letter and would do it again!  Served it over rice.

I am a very picky eater, and I LOVE this recipe! It's very good as is, but I tailor it to my and my husband's tastes by doubling the cayenne pepper. I also only use 2 or 3 small chicken breasts, and I add a cup of peas (only because I'm not crazy about meat). I serve over sticky rice and with warm naan. So good! I make it at least once every 3 weeks, and I've passed on the recipe to friends and family, who all love it as well.

This is a sooo delicious! My family would eat it twice a week of I let them.  I usually double it to make sure hubby has leftovers for work.  I also add extra curry powder to the chicken and cook that in a cast iron skillet without moving it so the chicken gets a nice crispy crust. You must make this recipe, you won't regret it!!!

This will be my 2nd time using this recipe - we loved it the 1st time and I have tried a couple other tikka masala recipes & they can't compare to this one!
We're looking forward to it again! I may try to add some yogurt when it's done because I love the tangy flavor.
I made it true to the recipe except I used butter. It is very 'hot' the way we like it !
Thanks Chris

I've made this recipe a few times now, and I loved it every time. I have almost all the ingredients on hand most of the time - even the heavy whipping cream I keep in the freezer and thaw for about a day in the fridge when i know I'll use it. I use regular butter instead of ghee, and it was fine. :)

If you choose to make this, I hope you enjoy, it really does deserve its good rating.

Delicious! I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste, 2% milk, and subbed 2tsp of Sriracha for the cayenne - because that's what I had on hand.  I also used chicken thighs, brushed them with 2T of melted butter, seasoned with curry, and broiled 10 mins each side. Chopped into chunks and added to tomato mix and served over rice and sprinkled green peas on top for some freshness. Spice combination was so good, reminded me of dishes at my favorite Indian lunch buffet. So yummy - will def be making again!

This recipe is simple and AMAZING!!! The only thing we changed was doubling the recipe to ensure we had leftovers!! Pour it over rice and have some naan for dipping and you are set! As good if not better than the Indian restaurant we go to!

Excellent.  Made this tonight after stumbling onto it a few days ago.  No significant deviations from the recipe (I used boneless skinless thighs, and Splenda instead of sugar) (oh, and also did about 2 tsp cayenne), and we loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome.  We made a double batch of the sauce and froze half for using in the future.  Tip:  If it's too spicy after you cook for the final, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more cream to cool it off a bit.  We loved it.

Very tasty recipe. My husband who told me 23+ years ago that he didn't like East Indian (curry) food; really enjoyed it. I found that I had too much sauce. Perhaps I didn't have enough chicken. There are only two of us, so I will make less sauce next time.

This turned out awesome!  Quick tip for anyone who is lactose intolerant.  Instead of heavy cream, I used coconut milk (1/2 - 2/3 of a can).  Instead of butter, I used olive oil to saute the onions and garlic.  Lastly, I marinated the chicken in yogurt, and added the same spices to the marinade as the sauce calls for.  Holy awesome chicken!

Amazeballs. My family was worshipping me. My 7-year old son now wants to move to India. We make this twice a week. It gives me a mouthgasm. Use fresh ginger and a hand blender for that extra profesh touch.

Loved this and my husband too!  because I am not having milk or heavy cream -- I uses coconut cream for more paleo friendly.  Great flavor.  Yum!  Can also omit sugar.

We all loved it! I didn't know what ghee was, and they didn't have it at my local store but a nice gentleman at the grocery store heard me asking about it and said to heat the 2 T of butter in the microwave (2 min.) and then use the top bubbly part and that worked fine. We also love spicy so I used even a little more cayenne pepper :). I also used cream cheese- just less than 1 brick because that's what I had and it turned out so so good.  Served it with basmati rice, green salad and naan bread. This is a favorite for sure!!  I will try low fat cream cheese though next time…. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! I made this recipe last night for our sunday dinner and even my 7 year old daughter raved(she packed leftovers into her school lunch). I love being able to control the spice level, but other than that i followed the recipe almost exactly as written, with only one change. I marinaded my chicken with curry powder and yogurt hoping to give it extra flavor, and while the flavor was excellent, the yogurt made it difficult to brown the chicken and i believe that step is important as it locks in the curry flavor. Any suggestions? All in all this recipe was a family hit and i will continue to make it for our sunday dinners; raita, chicken tikka masala, naan, baked curry cauliflour,  potato samosa's with mango chutney! Yum

This was AWESOME...I did not change a thing. I didn't add the extra tsp of sugar at the end, but did add a little more salt. I followed the spices as indicated. I did use my cast iron dutch oven to cook this in and browned the chicken first, set aside, left the pan drippings in there and continued with Step 1 of the recipe. I did use light cream and I will try it in the future with coconut milk (they were out at the store I was shopping in). Finished it with a garnish of cilantro and served over basmati rice that I had thrown peas in at the end of cooking. Seriously tasted like it was from an Indian restaurant. This is a keeper and I may try with chicken thighs, since my hubs prefers those. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the BEST Indian recipe I've ever had outside of a restaurant!!  I could just eat the sauce by itself, so fragrant and delicious! Measure out your spices and put them in a bowl before you start on anything, that way once your ghee is hot; you're ready to focus on cooking, not measuring out spices ;-)

I typically don't like spicy food; the amount of heat in the dish was just right for me. Cayenne can be adjusted for those who enjoy spicier dishes :)

I loved this!  I did marinate the chicken in yogurt and garam masala and madras curry for a few hours and therefore eased up on the cayenne for the sauce and reduced sugar a bit but otherwise followed the recipe closely. Superb and a big hit!

This is an excellent recipe! It tastes very much like restaurant tikka masala. I've been making the other recipe on this site for years, but I'm switching to this one from now on. It just tastes more authentic.  The only changes I made was to double the recipe and add an extra tsp of cayenne.  Three tsp gave it the perfect kick, if you like a spicy dish. Next time I double it I will likely reduce the cream by half a cup because mine came out ever-so-slightly too creamy.

Absolutely wonderful! Just enough heat to make your mouth water, yet allows you to still smash.

I used fresh ginger. 2T

Added...
zucchini
mushrooms
red pepper
yellow pepper
brocoli

cooked chicken
added curry powder
added veggies. 
Cooked veggies until partially cooked.
Added curry powder through. 
let simmer a little more.
Then added everything and juiced into sauce.


In my rice i added a little garlic powder, turmeric, cumin and cilantro.

We always top ours with some chives and cilantro. 

We absolutely loved it and hope you enjoy it.

This was awesome.  I am not much for measuring but I threw all these ingredients together and added a dash of garman masala.  I added vegetables because I like vegetables in everything.

I have never cooked Indian food and this came out amazing! Absolutely delicious. So similar with what my favorite Indian restaurant makes. Thanks so much for sharing this with us!

This recipe is incredible! I used the other chicken tikka masala recipe on this site just for the chicken marinade, and used this recipe for the sauce. It was very simple and the most delicious thing I've ever made! Only made a few changes. I omitted the cinnamon and instead added garam masala. I also left out the turmeric because I didn't have any. This is a very flexible dish, so you can change the spices to your taste. I will be making this many times in the future! Can't wait to bring it to an upcoming New Year's Eve party. Thanks for the fantastic recipe! :)

Outstanding! I have tried a few Indian recipes at home and they never come remotely close to tasting like what you'd get at a restaurant. However, this one hit the mark! I substituted half & half for heavy cream and still thought it was delicious. Even our 2-year old loved it. Will definitely be making again!

I've made this several times and everyone requests extras to take home with them. The only alterations I've ever made: I've used plain yogurt instead of cream, which worked out OK but I like the cream better, and I always add a little more curry powder :)

So delicious! Almost as good as the Indian restaurant we frequent!I make this recipe as is, no changes or substitutions (although I don't always let it simmer as long at the end as the recipe calls for). This can be a tad bit spicy but nothing overbearing. We make this at least twice a month if not weekly. Definitely pick up some Naan at your local grocery store (or try to make your own) and enjoy with the meal!

Love, love ,love this recipe. I normally double it and freeze 1/2 the batch. It's a really forgiving recipe, which is great if you have kids who are constantly interrupting you! My kids love it too, I just add less red pepper and less paprika. Yum!

This recipe was fantastic!! I paired it with Basmati white rice. My husband and I kept going back for seconds. It is very easy to make. Definitely a keeper. I did only use 1/2 onion and slightly less paprika than the recipe called for, but it still came out great.

Phenomenal.  Tastes just like our favourite takeaway.  It's quite easy and faultless to make. Even my husband loved it and he's terribly picky.  He's asked for this to be added to the 'rotation'. I rate it amazeballs.

Fantastic, after I made this I mixed peas into just to have a vegetable in the mix.  Excellent.  Nice level of heat, very flavorful.

As is, the recipe goes very well with peas.  OR, you can change the meat to pork and add a few generous spoons of peanut butter to make a panang curry.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic and I use it every time I have a craving for Indian food. I have another recipe for Tikka Masala that I got from an Indian friend that is a gourmet recipe and takes all day to make and I can honestly say that they taste exactly the same! I have never had anyone say that they didn't absolutely love it with which my picky family that is saying a lot!

This was completely delicious, just the same as my favorite Indian restaurant. I'm vegetarian so made this adding peas instead of chicken. It was also very quick, vegetarian style. I sautéed the onions and garlic in oil then added the spices, tomato sauce and eventually cream and peas. Sooo good. I will try with other veggies.

I made this in a crockpot, but didn't use the ghee (butter)or the vegetable oil.... and it turned out great! *I didn't add the whipping cream until it was all cooked through, and a few minutes prior to serving.  Next time I won't cut the chicken pieces so small.  This recipe is a keeper!

As written by others--this recipe is DELICIOUS made as written,  Spices are right on.  However, I have a problem with the amt of butter used to fry onions, garlic and spices.  My mixture is very dry--when it says continue to fry until fragrant-I need to add more butter.  Has anyone else experienced the same problem?  Also, 14 oz. of tomato sauce hardly makes enough sauce for spooning over basmati rice even after 1 c. of heavy cream is added?  I haven't seen my problem addressed on any other reviews. What am I doing wrong?

My life's mission is complete.....to re-create my local Indian restaurants butter chicken. This recipe is out of sight, and I'm sure I'm about to get super fat now that I can make this from home. Thank you chris, this recipe is crazy good. All the spices are perfectly balanced for me. And it puts all those wimpy butter chicken recipes to shame

I love this recipe and have been making it for years now. It used to be my guilty pleasure, but now I've FINALLY found the perfect substitute for the heavy cream. It's whole-milk yogurt. (Don't let the "whole milk" fool you - the substitution still saves you ~650 calories and a whopping 80g of fat per recipe.) I used Straus Whole-Milk Yogurt (subbing it 1:1). It's European-style yogurt so it's a bit runnier than regular or Greek yogurt. I found that it had the perfect consistency for this recipe and gave it just a slightly tangier flavor. I HIGHLY recommend trying this substitution. I tried various combinations of half & half and milk before, but this version was the best by far. This will now be a staple recipe for me. Yay!!

Perfection! So tasty. I used canned coconut milk instead of cream and the taste was spot on. I also cut the cayenne pepper in half, and the amount of heat was perfect for us wimps. When I added the chicken, I also added peas and it was a nice touch. We served over jasmine rice. Highly highly recommend this recipe

Color me impressed.  This was my first effort at Indian food and it was SOOOOO delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as directed with the exception of switching out the heavy cream for low fat Kefir.  Other than not thickening up too well with the substitution of the Kefir, I thought that it was absolutely delicious.  I added some corn starch at the end to help thicken it.  It definitely was spicy but the bite was great.  About what you would get if you went to a restaurant and ordered somewhere between a medium and a hot spicy level.  Enough to make you know that you had something spicy but not so much that your mouth burns for an hour after it.  I did put the whole thing in the crock pot and let it simmer for an hour or two once I added the chicken just to let the flavors meld.  Served it over lime and cilantro rice and with the Chickpea Curry recipe by Aminah at this site.  Was the best meal ever.  No need to go out for Indian any more if I can just learn how to make naan.

Awesome just like my favorite Indian restaurant in Colorado. I did what another suggested and added chicken broth about a 1/2 cup and I also used half and half not heavy cream. I like to have extra sauce to dip my naan in. So good must try. If your new to Indian food this is a great place to start.

Just fantastic.  I added just a pinch more curry powder for a bit more of a savory flavor, but it's really quite perfect as-is.

This was great! Bf and I both really liked it. Tasteless just like you think it does.
My modifications (out of necessity not desire): 
no tomato sauce, so I puréed a can of diced tomatoes and added about 1tsp tomato paste; 
fresh ginger instead of powder (added with garlic); 
1c of whole milk (no cream on hand);
used 6 well-trimmed chicken thighs instead of breasts; 
didn't measure curry powder- just sprinkled it on.
Not too sweet, not too spicy (actually rather mild and I'm a whimp), not too salty (bf thought it needed more but I disagreed).
I like using the diced tomatoes... I wonder if the canned sauce makes it too sweet otherwise. Consistency with milk was fine. At first I freaked out because after adding the milk, it didn't look smooth but all the spices and milk beautifully emulsify as the chicken simmers away in that last 30 minutes. 
Also I think this serves 4 more comfortably than 6. The 2 of us ate almost the whole thing! 
Will definitely make again. Thank you!

This recipe is delicious.  I made it for the first time tonight and my family loved it!  The only thing I did different is added a little salt when I seared the chicken.  I also doubled the recipe which made me a little nervous but the sauce still turned out great! Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again :)

Made this recipe last night. I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could have sauce to freeze as recommended. I also cut the cayenne pepper in half to be more friendly to those who don't like so much of a kick.  Let's just say that there was no leftovers. One of my guest is from East Pakistan, he had seconds and said everything was delicious. So hey, this recipe is a keeper.

Outstanding! My mom has this favorite dish at a local indian restaurant she just loves it. I use to have this spice called flavors of India from tastefully simple but I finally ran out and really wanted some indian food. I looked up recipes and found this one. Seeing how I had everything to make it and gave it a try. My mind was blown and so wasn't my mothers. She said she's never going out for indian again! I substituted the heavy cream for light cream and Greek yogurt. We also added cashews.

Oh my!! Oh yum!!! This is better than my local Indian restaurant, and I really like the Tika Masala at my local place. I wanted to make more than recipe called for, so I just upped everything without any real exact science and it was FABULOUS! Fiancé went back for thirds. This recipe def has heat (runny nose for sure), which we like, so cut back on the cayenne if not a fan of "heat". This is prob the best recipe I've tried on Allrecipes!! Awesome! Thanks for sharing! :)

Wow! I have been cooking Indian food for the past few years and this is one of my favorite recipes. I only made a few small changes...I marinated the chicken for several hours in the fridge in a mixture of plain Greek yogurt, Garam masala, turmeric and curry powder. Then after cooking the onion and garlic, I added the chicken/yogurt mixture and cooked it in the same pan. After a few minutes I added the tomato sauce and finished the recipe out as written. AMAZING!

This recipe is a hit!  I've made it numerous times and I am always asked for the recipe!  I like to grill the chicken before adding it to the sauce to add another layer of flavor.  Serve with lime wedges and cilantro and naan bread. My 7 year old has requested this for her birthday meal. Heaven!

Thanks for a great recipe!
Only substitution I recommend is replacing the heavy whipping cream with coconut milk. A lot less calories and just as delicious! I tried it both ways. If the sauce turns out thin with the coconut milk dissolve one tablespoon of corn starch in one tablespoon of water and stir in the sauce.

This is the most amazing recipe. Not only is it perfect chicken Tikka Masala, but the spice mixture in the first part is delicious! I make up large amounts of it, mix, then store as my go-to curry powder/garam masala/Indian-style seasoning. As you can probably tell I am no expert on the cuisine, but it really works in all of my Indian dishes. I made a few small subs in the recipe (butter not clarified, tomato paste diluted with water for the sauce) but no changes needed for a flawless dish. Thank you so much for sharing, I use this recipe all the time!

The best ever. Have made this more than 20x. Followed everything except I use boneless skinless thighs instead (just my preference) otherwise perfecto!

This recipe is phenomenal.My family loved it. It has a slight bit of sweetness from the sauteed onion, so; I added no sugar. Great!! I have made it several times, and, I follow it exactly except for adding no sugar.

I added 1 T Garam Masala thinking it was my cumin. As I was pouring in the tomato sauce I was thinking that it looked a little too thick--it was tomato paste. I couldn't find my turmeric. I didn't have ghee so I used olive oil. Everything else was as directed in the recipe. Moral of the story--this recipe is fool proof! It turned out great.

Made this exactly as directed, except I did add broccoli to the chicken after it was cooked, prior to adding the sauce. My family all agreed, it is a keeper!

This was delicious! Even with all the cayenne, I didn't find it too spicy at all.  I only had 3 breasts, but I found it meaty enough with 3 breasts.  I will definitely make this again.

I am making this now. It is at the simmering stage, but I've tasted the sauce and it is fantastic! My only tweak was increasing the heat (tripled it) because my boyfriend loves a good, fierce burn in his Indian dishes. I think this one is a keeper! Compared to many other Tikka masala recipes I've made, this one is pretty easy. Got it done in about the same amount if time it takes to open a jar of Patak's, with fewer preservatives and the taste is really, really good!

This recipe is delicious!  I have been looking for a good chicken tikka masala recipe for years, and I have tried all the other ones on this site.  This one is the best, by far.  It tastes just like the chicken tikka masala from my favorite Indian restaurant.  My husband also loves it- he said this is the best chicken tikka masala he has ever had!

I've made this multiple times now. I've found that I prefer to double the ingredients to have more sauce. I also cube the chicken and season w/ curry powder and leave in ziptop bag in fridge all day.  I don't double the cayenne pepper though (I love spicy foods but my children don't yet).  We've tried it w/ heavy cream and also with fat free half and half.  We prefer the heavy cream. 
We love this recipe!!!

Amazingly flavorful! I was really questioning the cinnamon when I put it in, but it's not overpowering at all. The chicken turned out perfectly, and the sauce, even by itself, was excellent over rice. I'll be making this again and again!

Ok, yes, it takes longer than just dumping a container of pre-made sauce over your chicken, but holy Ganesha it's yummy! Replaced onion with onion powder because onions are not my friend, same with garlic, left out the cayenne because I am completely a wimp, and used butter because I couldn't find ghee and didn't have 45 minutes to make it. :) Still came out lovely!

It didn't get as think as I would have thought. Me and my family have been trying a new thing where each one of us pick a new recipe, and cook it on our night to cook. I chose this because it looked good and simple. And it was AMAZING. Everyone in our household (six people) all really enjoyed it and decided it will forever be in our recipe book.

Oh my God, this recipe is AMAZING exactly as written, tastes like what comes out of my favorite Indian takeaway. I wouldn't change a thing and I will be making a huge batch to freeze so I can have this as an easy dinner on work nights. Even my curry hating husband likes it. Win!!

Fabulous! Even my 8 year old son inhaled it ( with extra tomato sauce and some plain yogurt to tone down the heat). Served over brown basmati rice and with Naan from Trader Joes, great meal. I added some steamed cauliflower to the sauce to add a veggie. Will make a larger batch to freeze next time for sure! Thank you for this winner!

This is a wonderful tikka masala recipe. Just as good if not better than my favorite Indian restaurant. The only thing i changed was i used 1 tsp of sugar rather than a Tbs, and that was only because I misread it. This is a new favorite for us!

This is the first recipe where just about everybody made it as is and loved it.  I'm a tinkerer but decided to be true to the recipe.  Fantastic!  I added less cayenne and used half and half.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night with my sister with thigh meat as that's what we had and apparently it's better for flavour in curries. Not was it just as good as your fave Indian restaurants one, it was really easy to make and tastes even better the next day! Thanks!!

This is one of our favorite recipes.  I usually substitute sour cream or plain yogurt for the whipping cream.  Since I'm only cooking for two, I like to make the whole recipe of the sauce and freeze half of it.  Then when I don't feel like cooking I just have to saute some chicken and add in the frozen block of sauce.

This recipe is fantastic, I added a tablespoon of paprika instead of two teaspoons though.
I also added an orange bell pepper. I highly recommend this recipe.

I first had Chicken Tikka Masala in San Deigo in August.  Thought I'd give it a try.  Made it the first time for guests. Brave huh? It was great! I will make the extra sauce and freeze it for later. Thanks!

So so so so so so good! My family devoured this. My sister in particular went back for seconds again and again. I didn't have turmeric or tomato sauce so I subbed in more curry powder and a can of diced tomatoes. Besides that and doubling the amount of cayenne, I followed the recipe exactly. The creaminess hits just the right notes. Thank you so much for this recipe! It won't be long before I make it again-- my sister is practically begging for it.

This recipe is amazingly flavorful and so incredibly easy to make! I doubled the amount for all the spices except cumin; instead of tomato sauce, I used a 4oz packet of tomato paste and mixed it with 10oz of milk. Truly amazing! Thank you so much for sharing!

This is such a great recipe! I'm vegetarian so I make it with chickpeas instead, and with skim milk instead of whipping cream but it's still great!

My boyfriend is a Chicken Tikka Masala addict, so I thought I'd make it at home for his birthday.  This is now a permanent recipe we make for dinner on a regular basis.  Out of all the versions on this site, we feel this is the best!  It's even better than our local Indian restaurant!

Some changes I've made: I do NOT add the optional sugar or salt at the end. it's perfect without it. Also, instead of 4 chicken breasts I only use two, we like a more sauce to chicken ratio.

Have made this recipe several times. I have also dabbled with authentic Indian curried chicken recipes using the individual spices and after making this I will probably never go crazy with individual measuring of the spices and just use curry powder. Had leftovers one day at work and people asked me to make enough for them next time. Simple and full of flavor. I have tweaked the recipe slightly by using coconut milk instead of cream. Can't say it tastes better or worse or how it effects the consistency since I have never used cream in the recipe, but you cant go wrong using coconut milk in an Indian recipe. I also found that I needed(wanted) a lot more of the curry powder to get a full flavor. This recipe also serves as a great vegetarian alternative. I have used beans, potatoes, peas and carrots and corn. Throw it over some Basmati rice and enjoy!

Made this for my husband and he loved it.  It's fairly simple to make but requires some prep work.  Like most cooks, I added a few extra spices here and there to make it my own.  Served with rice and naan.

This was excellent.  Not 100% like the tikka masala at my favorite restaurant but as close as I'll ever get and really delicious!  Even the bf who is not a huge fan of Indian food liked it.  I did tweak it a little.  Dialed down the sugar and upped the cayenne.  Also used less salt.  I had some hot madras curry powder so I used a dash of that as well.  A tip for cream newbies:  heavy cream and whipping cream are pretty much the same and interchangeable in a recipe like this.

My husband is obsessed with this. I make it all the time and it has become a staple at our place. I'm South Asian, so I know good chicken tikka masala well, and this is it. The only things I did differently 1) cut the chicken while raw into pieces and marinate in a ziploc bag in tandoori chicken masala for minimum 1 hr in the refrigerator. The tandoori chicken masala mix can be found in little Shaan or MDS boxes at international / indian stores. 1) I use chili powder (indian) in place of the cayenne pepper - but you have to be very careful with this, I believe it is spicier than cayenne pepper. It's more authentic that way. I use less tomato sauce, as well - just 8 ounces.

This is a great tikka curry recipe. I make this with shrimp or chicken and add some potatoes for texture. I also add extra cayenne, since we like spicy at our house. It makes a lot of curry, so you can freeze in portion sizes for a quick dinner later. Also remember to make a little extra basmati to freeze in separate containers. I took some of this for lunch at work one day and a coworker remarked that it smelled just like restaurant curry. Very yummy - to cut the fat content, you can use half a cup of half and half and half a cup of 2% plain yogurt and add a tablespoon of honey to cut the sharpness of the yogurt. Great stuff!

This recipe is amazing.  This was my first time cooking anything so exotic, and not only was it easy it was a lot of fun!  If you're sensitive to spice, go easy on the curry and probably omit the red pepper that's recommended.  I like it spicy so I kick it up and it's awesome!  And it's even better the second time around as left overs!  I've had to get kind of creative on several occasions due to lack of an ingredient and it's come out delicious every time.  No ginger?  No problem.  You can use regular milk to substitute the heavy whipping cream (and probably a lot of calories).  And in place of the ghee don't hesitate to use regular butter with a tablespoon of cooking oil.  But try not to stray too far from the original recipe, it really is perfect as is.

Made a few times as written, and made a few times with changes. Love it either way. Often I make this as written just without the sugar (I keep forgetting it anyway). 

We like spicy in my house so if anything I'm a bit generous with the spices. A great go to curry recipe.

Tip: vegetable oil is a better substitute for ghee than regular butter according to several Indian cookbook writers.

I absolutely LOVED it. It is super easy and tastes great, I added 1 tsp Garam Masala and 1/4 tsp Coriander for more authentic flavor. In my opinion the spiciness level is just right, but I love spicy foods :)  I served it with Jasmin rice and Naan (Indian bread) My new favorite recipe! Thanks!

AMAZING!  I tripled the amount so I could have a bunch of it separated in ziploc bags in the freezer for a quick meal.  I throw in some sliced bell peppers while it simmers with the chicken to make it a whole meal.  Definitely serve it over rice so none of the sauce goes to waste!

I've made this recipe twice, and it is SOOO good and simple to make. This is coming from a woman who has only learned how to cook in the past 6 months. It does take time, but it is well worth it.

Delicious!! For those of us that like the heat mild, I like to halve the cayenne pepper - it gives a little kick, but it won't leave your mouth burning. I always substitute unsalted butter for ghee with no problems. Also, I've tried making this with heavy cream as stated, half-and-half, and whole milk (the only thing I had at the time!) and I absolutely recommend using HEAVY CREAM unless you have no other choice. The creaminess of the heavy cream seems to mellow out the acidity from the tomato sauce and the heat from the cayenne, and the result is a superior curry compared to the half-and-half and milk versions. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I have used this site a lot for recipes but I just joined to let everyone know this recipe is the bomb! I've made it probably ten times and I never tire of it. 

The only thing I do differently is I hit the sauce with an immersion blender once it's all together and I take out half of the sauce before adding the chicken and freeze it. There's only two of us and I use half the meat it calls for. I use a combination of breast and thigh meat. It works out perfectly making the full amount of sauce, removing and freezing half then adding the chicken to what's left. 

I have also doubled this recipe and frozen individual pints of the sauce for later use and that worked just as well. 

I will be making this for the rest of my life. Thanks Chris!!!

I haven't commented much on recipes I've tried on this site, but I have to say that this was SO fantastic! I made a few adjustments the second time I made this: I used 1/2 cup of half and half instead of a full cup of cream, lightly salted the chicken breasts and rubbed on the curry powder before I browned the chicken, and I browned the chicken in coconut oil instead of vegetable oil - this added nicely to the flavor I thought. Anyone looking to try this recipe, do it - you'll be so glad you did!

I had some pre-cooked chicken cubes in my freezer leftover, and wanted to use them up. This fit the bill and was REALLY good! I have tried a lot of recipes for tikka masala, and this by far came closest to what I have in the restaurants. As presented, this recipe has very little heat. Next time, I will kick it up a notch and possibly add in a tad more cream. Im so thankful I found this recipe, its the one I am going to use from here on out! Thanks for sharing :-)

This recipe produced the exact flavor we were hoping for, and the leftovers were still very delicious today. We served with basmati rice and Trader Joe's naan. Next time, I'll pre-measure & combine the cumin, salt, ginger, cayenne, cinnamon & turmeric, so that I can easily dump it all in to the cooked onions & garlic. Overall, easy recipe to follow, and the result was excellent.

This was amazing! I lightened it up by only using 1 tablespoon of ghee and replacing the heavy cream with 6oz of non-fat greek yogurt and 1/2 cup of 1% milk. I left everything else the same. You have to make sure to temper the yogurt before adding it to the tomato sauce to avoid curdling. I'm sure it's not as good as the higher fat version but it still tasted amazing without all the guilt!

An excellent recipe for tikka masala! Easy to make and surprisingly very flavourful. It really lookes and tastes like what you would get at an Indian restaurant. 

I made a few changes, though, and added 2 teaspoons of gara masala to the base sauce. I also marinated the chicken with 3 tbsp of plain yogurt, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp curry, 1 tsp cilantro, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

Fantastic recipe. My family loves Indian food and Chicken Tikka Masala is my favourite dish. We have tried many jarred sauces and from-scratch recipes but this one was by far the best. The only change we made was to add a bit more cream as it was a little spicy for our taste and we added a few tablespoons of coconut cream. Will definitely make again.

So, I cooked up this dish tonight. I too added much more cayenne pepper - because we like it HOT. I omitted the sugar. Really with the cream, I don't think you need it. It is simply delicious. My husband has had thirds, and my son said that it was a thirty out of ten. I guess this was a hit. :)

Son was going to work function and was asked to bring a curry as it was an Indian night. I just googled "best curry recipe" and went to this web site. Have used it before so knew  I could trust it. He made this (by himself) and was told it was the best one of the night and they all wanted the recipe.  Mum wins again ;o)

I have made the recipe about 4 times now and have to say that i love it.  The paprika that i use is a bit on the hot side so i do cut back on the cayenne a little and i also use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.  Both types of chicken are good but i do like the thighs as they are a bit more moist and have more flavor.

This was a long process starting with preparing the ghee, but was WORTH it!  I used fat free half-n-half and it turned out great.  I'm sure heavy cream would have made it better, but we still thought it was a 5 star without the extra calories!!!!

Easy peasy and so delicious!!  My whole family loved this recipe--even my 7-year old!  We will be enjoying this one again and again.  I left out the cayenne so that it would be more palatable to my little guy, using paprika instead.  Even though it was mild, the sauce was so tasty and full of flavor.  I did add some salt and sugar at the end, too, as recommended in the recipe, and also added fresh spinach to cook in the sauce at the end, for our vegetable component.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!

I made this recipe tonight. I have tried many Indian recipes before, and this is by far the best! Thank you for the recipe. I left everything the same, but I changed the ghee to butter and the vegetable oil to olive oil. I did this only because I didn't have the recommended ingredients. It still turned out great!

This was amazing!  I added some sweet potatoes in with the chicken and they went quite well with everything else.  I made this while my husband was out of town because he's not a fan of Indian food but I think he would like it!  My only complaint is that the onions combined with all the other spices made my eyes burn horribly while cooking it.

Made it exactly as the recipe called and there were NO LEFTOVERS.  The spices were just enough to give it the kick it needed. My son and husband gave it a thumbs up and said it was a keeper.  Don't let all the ingredients stop you from making it. The recipe is not complicated and does not take long to put together. As my butter (ghee)was clarifying and garlic/onions cooking I mixed all the spices together in a small bowl then added to the recipe when called for.  While Step 2 was slowly simmering I used another skillet to cook up the chicken pieces.  I did add the optional salt and sugar at the end and the dish tasted as good as any that I have had in restaurants.  Thank you Chris for sharing this.

Delicious. We had to go to a health food store to find the ghee.

i have made this a number of times and my son always commented it was too 'soupy' ... this time I added some parboiled cauliflower and peas and it was perfect. I will try some cubed potatoes as some reviewers have suggested. But oh my this is good!

I took a risk and prepared this recipe for a group of eight. It was the rave. I cut the chicken breast into nugget size and steamed them. Once they were tender and cooked I added them to the sauce for about 30 min. I have sent copies of the recipe to all my guests.

Definitely lives up to the rave reviews and is worth the extra effort of standing at the stove. I used almost two full teaspoons of cayenne and WOW was that hotter than anticipated. Will probably use just one or one and a quarter next time. I also used a bit less cumin because it's not my favorite seasoning. I don't think I technically had enough chicken, but the sauce is yummy over rice just by itself. Thanks so much!

This was excellent. The flavors were so different. I do not like a lot of spice so I only added 1/4 tspn of the pepper. Other than that, I followed it exactly and it was very, very good.  Very flavorful and it smelled great cooking.

This was an excellent masala. Even with the recommended amount of cayenne there was still enough kick.  I might bump it up at a later time.  Not a hard recipe to make.  This is a keeper.

Excellent taste and easy to make!  I used unsalted butter instead of ghee and used half the amount of cayenne as others suggested.  Also, I added just a little more cream than the recipe called for because I had a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce (other reviewers had suggested keeping that ratio the same).  I added carrots and a head of chopped cauliflower to the skillet in step 3 and the addition of these vegetables was fantastic.  It made a perfect chicken/veggie tikka masala.  To accompany this, I made basmati rice, the Cucumber Carrot Salad (Raita) recipe also on this site (and also 5 stars) and served it all with Trader Joe's Naan.  An outstanding meal!  One suggestion:  when it is time to add all the spices in step 1, it is much easier if you have premeasured these and put them all in a small bowl before you get started.  Then you can add them all at once and stick to the cooking times listed.  Also, we didn't find it necessary to add any additional salt or sugar at the end of step three.

Moved the Nebraska from China and have found the Indian food here very bland. I added 2 to 3 times the recommended amount of curry powder. Froze the left over sauce for later, I will be making this again.

Made it today for the first time ... you know it's a hit when your 11 month old can't get enough of it! It was extremely tasty and while I didn't have turmeric or cayenne pepper on hand I improvised with a bit of garam masala and tandoori masala. I'm already wondering how long I have to wait until I can make it again.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe.  I love Indian food but I'm trying to cut down on eating out.  This was better than what I get at restaurants.  The only change I made was to go with half cream, half sour cream, plus I added a chopped jalapeno.  Outstanding.  Sublime.

EXCELLENT!!!!  Made exactly as stated except for the "ghee".  I used 2 tbsp. of unsalted butter, and over medium heat I let it get brown and sizzling,-kind of like when you are making "brown butter"- then I added the onions and proceeded with the recipe.  I did only use 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper, but next time would use 3/4 tsp. and gradually make it to the 1 tsp.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is magnificent. We made it exactly as it was written.  We will likely add more cayenne in the next attempt, however, that is just a matter of preference. I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I had some leftover roast pork which I cut up in place of the chicken.  I didn't bother with the ghee, used plain butter, and I forgot to add the curry at the end - although I have to say the flavor was so good, I'm not sure the curry would have made that big a difference. I sprinkled chopped parsley over the servings for extra appeal. Served with Basmati rice.  I'll be making this dish again with the chicken.  UPdate - made this again WITH the curry (and chicken). The curry does make a difference. I also added 1tsp coriander and garam masala (make my own so it's always on hand).  Made this dish and Chicken Biriyani from this site, with contributions from others that included curried chick peas and cauliflower.  Excellent dinner.  Raves from all 18 guests.

Substituted coconut milk for cream as many recommended. Also used a little less butter (didn't use ghee) to make it a little healthier. Delicious. A little spicy for our taste so would cut back on the cayenne next time but will be making again!

Very easy to make. I used unsalted butter instead of ghee because I couldn't find it. I also added the extra teaspoon of sugar at the end. Served over white rice and a side of naan bread. Leftovers were even better the next day.

This recipe is absolutely amazing but for a healthier version: Saute onions in a little olive oil, add garlic. Follow the recipe adding spices and no salt added tomato sauce. Leave out the heavy whipping cream and top with non fat plain greek yogurt once served. I ate mine with quinoa and it was delicious! Ground turkey also works well with this recipe.

Love, love this recipe!  Very simple. 
Exchanged coconut milk for the heavy whipping cream only to cut down fat content.  I know that using the cream would be yummy as well.

Perfect balance of sweet and spicy. 

Served it with basmati rice and topped it with raisens and shredded coconut....

This will be a 'go to' recipe for our family dinners.  Would be a great meal to share with friends!!

Very yummy. Would give 5 stars but I made so many mods because I was out of things I can't honestly rate the original! used coconut milk instead of cream, tomato paste and water instead of tom. sauce, and didn't have any cayenne or curry powder. Was definitely missing that extra kick because of that, but it was delicious. Will make again, and experiment.

Excellent and authentic!  I substituted the heavy cream with evaporated milk and cut the salt to half to make it more healthy.  Of course I added more cayenne.  In our house we like it hot!

A few months ago I brought home chicken breasts from the grocery store.  My husband, who is a dyed in the wool beef fan, was less than enthused.  I decided to check this site for a great chicken curry recipe because that's one chicken dish he loves.  This has become my family's favorite chicken recipe hands down.  The first time I made it it was too spicy so I now reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp.  I've substituted half-n-half for the cream with stellar results, and coconut milk for the cream for those with dairy allergies.  We eat it over rice topped with unsweetened shredded coconut.  Fantastic!

I love Indian and Middle Eastern type food so when I came across this recipe I was super excited to try it. Since I'm still new to this cooking stuff I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. It was delicious and even my boyfriend loved it. I will defiantly be cooking this again. thank you.

This is amazing!  I served it with naan from this website and received rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly; it was pretty spicy, but so delicious.

This was SO good. My only alteration was subbing half and half for heavy cream to cut down on fat. If I could give this recipe six stars I would. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

Easy! I used whole milk and salted butter. Otherwise followed the recipe - it was better than the resturant. We will add a little more heat next time, along with veggies! thanks!

This was delicious! We love Indian especially Tikka Masala but in Chicago our favorite restaurant is soooo expensive. I think this will be our new go to when we are craving Indian. The only changes I made was that I used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of ghee, light cream instead of whipping cream (to cut the fat content), upped the cayenne to 1 1/2 teaspoons for more of a kick, 1/4 teaspoon sugar (next time I will omit completely), added 3 small cubed potatoes towards the end of simmering (I cooked them in the microwave first). My husband loves Vindaloo, that's where I got the idea for the potatoes and they were delicious in the sauce. I served it over organic brown basamati rice. My husband was impressed I can cook such delicious Indian food! Quick, easy, and I will definitely make again!  We are having the leftovers tonight for dinner, I can't wait!

Great recipe, just like in our favorite Indian restaurant.  I only used two very large chicken breast, so there was plenty of sauce. I probably only used about 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and it left a nice after heat.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly except for using turmeric since I didn't have any on hand. The sauce came out really nice. I served it with rice.

This recipe is amazing, and tastes just as good as the Curry I've had in a restaurant. Just enough spice, and flavor to keep me making it time after time.

I love Chicken Tikka Masala.  Have been searching for a good recipe since I moved away from my beloved Indian Oven back home.  I've made this recipe twice with excellent results both times.  The sauce is delicious and it's just the right amount of spicy.  We added chopped bell pepper when there was about 20 minutes left in order to add a little more flavor and chunkiness.  I'm also thinking of substituting the cinnamon for garam masala so we'll see if that's a winner or a loser.  In any case, TRY THIS RECIPE!  You won't regret it in the slightest!

WOW!I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  I did substitute lite coconut milk for heavy cream and a can of diced tomatoes (lightly drained) for the tomato sauce, as it's all I had.  I forgot to add the sugar.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, Chris!

This was soooo good!! Have made it several times now and the only changes I made were to leave the sugar out and to add some potatoes and carrots to make it a little more hardy.  Served over rice and it was very flavorful! This is definitely one of my new favorites!

Made the recipe almost as is.  Cut back a little on salt and cayenne.  Didn't have heavy cream so I used approx 3 heaping tablespoons of Sour Crema and a 1/2 cup of 1% milk.  Very good!  Just like the restaurant as other's have said. Sooo good over rice.  I cheated and went to local Indian store for some Naan bread.  Definitely going on my staple menu.  At least once a month.  Thanks for the recipe !

Very good, complex flavors that blend together nicely.  I actually cut the cayenne in half and still found it too spicy (of course heat is a personal thing, and with everything else going on in the dish, why overshadow it with spiciness?)  
I made a little extra sauce which I used to flavor some rice, which is what I served the chicken on top of (not sure of its authenticity, but it worked well).

Amazing faux-Indian dish.  It's especially great to help go through your spices... the recipe uses quite a large quantity.  The only changes I make:  Use only a teaspoon of sugar and sometimes I substitute potatoes for chicken when I'm not in a meat mood (honestly I think I like it better with just potato).  Definite staple in my house and will really knock your socks off!

I have made this several times and like other reviewers say, it is completely amazing. I decided to add a review to let you know that if you omit the heavy cream, a good alternative is to instead use a can of thai coconut milk. Still turned out good. It was slightly thinner and lacked a tiny bit in flavor. Dairy version as written is 5/5. Non dairy version is 4/5.

Fabulous!! Followed this recipe to a T (however decided to use the 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce with the extra 2 T of cream as suggested by another review since this was what i had on hand). I was worried about half way through when I tasted it and it was super spicy... Not the case this was true restaurant quality. Nicely done! This wil be a regular in our home. Thank you Chris

Amazing! This is awesome. The chicken was great, I went to a Thai restaurant the other day which inspired me to make this because the food was that good. This recipe is very similar to what I had in the Thai restaurant. I loved it.

Absolutely fabulous and so easy! This was my first time ever making Indian food, and I was scared of how my bf would react (he's a picky eater). But come to find out, he found it excellent! I served it with warm basmati rice and garlic naan. I also doubled the sauce, as I like alot of sauce =) Thanks for sharing, definitely one of my favorite dishes on here.

I made this because I was missing Indian food which is hard to come by in the town I recently moved to. I chose this recipe because it had the easiest list of ingredients and the easiest directions (yeah! I'm like lightning, choosing the path of least resistance). Turned out almost like my favorite NYC UES restaurant's tikka masala.  My husband loved it too. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is really delicious.  I found it about 2 weeks ago and I've already made it twice.  I've also learned that it's really forgiving.  I've used butter instead of ghee and I've left out a spice or two if it wasn't in the cupboard.  It still turned out awesome!  It is also much easier than other recipes I've read for this dish.  My boyfriend is not a fan of Indian food and he even requested it the second time around.  That is saying a lot!

So amazing!  I always try to cook Indian recipes and have them come out like the restaurants, but they never are close.  This recipe was close and great.

Unbelievable! Didn't think this recipe was gonna be as amazing as it is. I cooked the onions, garlic and spices then blended it all together to make a more creamy sauce and added some curry spice to it before adding the chicken. It tastes better than most Indian restaurants I have been too, thank you so much for this recipe. Indian food is normally so expensive in chicago and this makes me wanna make it by the gallon and freeze it for many amazing meals to come! serve with naan and rice for a authentic indian meal that cant be beat. Loved it!

Absolutely wonderful Indian dish. We looked this up and tried it after having homemade Indian food at my son's International School culture festival.  My wife and son, who have never been fans of Indian food, loved it. The sauce is wonderfully flavorful, and leftovers freeze well. Tastes great served over brown rice. We love spicy food, so we doubled the cayenne pepper.

Great recipe because you can modify it slightly and it still tastes fabulous.  The only reason I modified is I did not have all ingredients and no time to shop.  I looked for a simple masala recipe and thankfully found this one.

I had an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, so supplemented with chicken broth.  Completely forgot the curry!  Not paying attention since I was multitasking.  Used Demerara sugar and ground New Mexico red chile powder instead of cayenne, olive oil, and did not have ghee so used regular butter.

I think if your substitutes are pretty close, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I just made this curry and must say not only is it AMAZING and delicious but it was SO easy! I added a little extra curry powder and cayenne pepper as I like it just a bit spicier.
