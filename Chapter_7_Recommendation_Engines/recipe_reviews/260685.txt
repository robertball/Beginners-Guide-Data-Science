I like this cake.  I bought a box of wonderful Fuji apples and wanted to make some things that I hadn't made before.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the temperature for baking it was a little high, and as a result, the cake and the apples turned out a little dry.  I would lower the temp to 375.  The flavor is great and I loved the lemon zest and the shortcake-like cake layer.  We ate a piece right out of the pan, and then later with vanilla ice cream on top, and then even later, with our coffee!  Really good, thanks for the recipe.
