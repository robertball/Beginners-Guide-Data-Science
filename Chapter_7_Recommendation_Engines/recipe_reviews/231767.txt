While everything is better with cream cheese, as the other reviews state, this is an amazing dairy free option for those who are craving jalapeno poppers and may have an allergy. Also, using just bacon as the only fat keeps this light. I used less bacon than the recipe called for to make it lighter. Bravo.

I think if you leave the cream cheese in there it would be fantastic!! Lots of flavor exploding!

These were very, very bland as written.  There is no seasoning to flavor these at all.  We basted with BBQ sauce the last 5 minutes of cooking and it added a lot of flavor- really the only flavor.  If I were to make these again I would- like the last reviewer- add cream cheese.  I think I would also add some BBQ sauce to the filling.

Made a few adjustments and this turned out great. Seasoned chicken with creole seasoning, placed cream cheese in peppers, and cooked in air fryer. Very good. Will make again with these adjustments.

Good recipe, I am doing Keto and this was a guilt free pleasure! I changed a few things: spread a thin layer of cream cheese in each pepper first ,changed to Turkey Bacon and used oven broiler at 500â€™ for a total cook time of 25 Min. They where perfect! Thanks!

Made them with more seasoning;  a VERY finely minced Tai chili mixed with garlic powder and salt. Dredged chicken pieces in that mixture and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.

After reading the reviews l made these changes: added Greek... cream cheese  and Greek yogurt which you  can find at Walmart& Ralphs. I added just enough of the cream cheese to line the pepper around the inside,sliced a whole skinless boneless  chicken breast (it's the only thing I had) and with the thinner  half cute that into stripes and then into half's once l seasoned them with taco seasoning l you can also  find on this site. I soaked the  skewers in water for 7 hrs. So the skewers won't burn on the grill. I even tried using turkey bacon on one I had to put two skewers just to hold the t.b. in place and I would suggest putting the turkey bacon popper over direct heat (hot spot) to crisp it up.the chicken breast and the t.b. poppers  came out perfectly  moist. This recipe is very inventive thank you Alisa for sharing, it's a keeper.

Perfect if you add cream cheese between the chicken send the jalapeno and top with cheddar cheese in the last few minutes
