I followed the recipe as written and this stroganoff was not creamy at all. It was extremely watery and on the bland side. I added mushrooms a cup of sour cream salt and pepper. Better but not something I will make again.

Great recipe! Used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of cream of mushroom and tasted amazing!
