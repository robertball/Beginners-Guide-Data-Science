This was an easy recipe to prepare.  We let the pork chops marinate for about an hour.  I made a full batch of marinade and a 1/2 batch of marinade for basting and it was just enough for 5 pork chops.  I will definately make this again.

I used this marinade with a 1lb pork tenderloin, and it turned out really nicely.  I was worried it would be 'honey mustard pork' but dijon mustard and that little bit of beer made a big difference.
