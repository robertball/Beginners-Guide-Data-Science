I also needed to add time because the beans weren't cooked.  I found the carrots overcooked at the end.  If I make this again, I will cook everything but the carrots and celery for the first 35 minutes and do a 10-minute natural release.  I will then add the carrots and celery and pressure cook for another 10 minutes and do another 10-minute natural release.

I thoroughly enjoyed this "meatless" meal. The beans weren't soft at the end of 35 minutes cook time and 10 minute NPR. So I put the lid back on and pressure cooked for another 10 minutes with a 10 minute NPR. This time they were done.

Great vegan dish that will be enjoyed by all, not just vegans!  I made almost no changes.  As suggested by other reviewers, I adjusted the time to 45 minutes.  The only ingredient changes that I made were that I used only 4 cups of veggie broth and tippled the tomatoes because I prefer more of a new than a soup, and tomatoes are delicious.  I also threw in some red, green, and yellow peppers.  The only other thing I changed was the spices.  I love more spicy dishes, so I included a tsp + of one of my favorite spice blends from a local spice/olive oil/vinegar market.  I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty. Like the other review, 45 minutes initial cook time yielded better bean consistency for my dry, older beans. I added 3 Kirkland bratwursts with the skin removed and browned for a bit of extra flavor, too.

I found this smelled amazing, but didn't have much taste. To be fair, I used low sodium stock, as my husband has been told to watch his salt. However, beyond that, I thought this could have used more spices or something to add some depth. I'd make it again, but tinker with it more.

All I did differently was to add some chopped spinach I had on hand. Husband loves it!

This tasted wonderful!  I soaked the beans overnight, Used 32 oz of chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and used only 21 minutes in the IP with a 15 minute natural release.  The beans were very soft. you could do a natural release of 10 minutes if you want them more firm.

It was ok.  A little lacking in "zing".  I'm not such a fan of all 15 beans.  Would probably be better with a few more different vegetables and less beans.

This soup came out delicious. I made the same change as others, cooking it for 45 minutes.  Very hearty and tasty. With homemade bread, it's a perfect meal.

YUM YUM YUM!!! The only change I made was to add the seasoning packet that came with the beans, I'm not vegan. It was absolutely delish!
