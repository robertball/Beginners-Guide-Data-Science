Made for the Allrecipes Buzz Recipe Group - This was an okay recipe for us.  I served this as a dip with Scoops. I added the black olives and  some fresh hot and spicy oregano to give it more zip.  Thanks for sharing your recipe junekathrein!

Recipe Group Selection: 30, November 2013 ~ Quick and easy dip to put together.  We are not olive eaters, so I used tomatoes instead and added a little lettuce.  It stays creamy while hot, but once it cools down the slightest bit, it gets very thick.  I made a half a batch for our dinner and served right on the tortilla chips.  5-stars for the ease of the recipe and the leftovers reheated very well, 4-stars for flavor.  Next time I will spice it up with a jalape√±o and serve as a dip from a small crockpot.  Thanks, junekathrein for sharing your recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group...We loved this! The only complaint is that once it starts to cool, and that happens quickly, it gets super thick. Next time I plan to do this in my mini slow cooker, and that should do the trick. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
