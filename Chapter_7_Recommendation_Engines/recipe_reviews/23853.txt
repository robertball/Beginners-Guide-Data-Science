This turned out to be an easy and delicious soup although the original ingredients were a little bland for my taste.  I ended up adding 3 more boullin cubes and added some chopped onions to add a little more flavor.

This is a good recipe to encourage a reluctant broccoli eater especially if they like cheese.  I have been trying to copy Quizno’s (a fast food place) broccoli cheese soup and this comes close.  While the cheese was melting in a smaller pot, the frozen broccoli was simmering in a soup pot with the instant chix stock  (I used 3t of chicken base like a previous reviewer)and the water used to reconstitute it, about 4 oz. Extra cheddar cheese and milk took the place of the cream since I rarely have it.  Turned out great.

This was pretty tasty. I used real aged cheddar instead of the processed cheese. Very hearty.

This was my first ever try at making Broccoli Cheese Soup and I made it for a group of 16 women! I tripled the recipe but had LOTS left over. I could have doubled it and there would have been plenty. They all loved it and told me it was better than Panera's! (a local favorite)I, personally, thought it could use a little more broccoli and I did not like the vague amount of water it called for in the recipe but I used commom sense and added just enough water
to thin it out some. Delicious!!

Great for a cold, rainy, sleeting evening! I made this with what I had on hand: 12 oz broccoli, 3.5 cups whole milk, 2.5 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 4 cubes chicken boullion, and 1/3 cup flour.
We loved it!!  Very easy and tasty.

OH MY GOSH this is such a wonderful easy and delicious soup. I can never get my kids to eat broccoli and I made this cause I was craving this soup and had the kids do a taste test, and they could not believe that broccoli taste that good...I did add 3 extra teaspoons of chicken boullion, and I also cut up 1 can of sliced potatoes in it and I omitted the water and we liked it cheesey so we added 3 1/2 cups of cheese...

I mixed the flour with the cream cold, because flour usually lumps unless mixed with a cold liquid.  It worked just fine this way too. Good recipe, but cheddar would be better (and healthier).

I only had a small taste before serving it at a large family gathering.  It was very good.  The cheese didn't melt as fast as we thought but by the time it was served it was smooth and creamy.  Really good soup.  There was nothing left.

This recipe was wonderful. I did tweak it a bit...I added some extra shredded colby jack and sharp cheddar cheese, and used fresh vegetables...added white onion and a clove of garlic. Used the new Velveeta Sharp cheddar processed cheese for the base and it was wonderful. Turned out great.

This is an excellent soup and very tasty! I like soups to be rich, so I also added a can of cream of chicken soup and before I put the flour in, I dissolved it in cold water first so it wouldn't be lumpy. If you want a good hearty soup, this is the one to try!

This was the first time I had made brocolli cheese soup.  I used 14 oz frozen brocolli, 1 can of chicken broth instead of the water and added 1/2 of an onion(diced) to brocolli when I cooked it.  I melted 1/3 stick of butter in saucepan then added flour and milk so that it didn't get lumpy and I omitted the heavy cream adding extra milk to consistency I prefer.  I used 1 cup velveeta and 1 cup sharp cheddar.  Also added a little garlic salt and chicken base instead of bouillion.  It was soooo good!  I'll definitely make this again.

I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen chopped broccoli and shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta.  Turned out great!  Thick and rich and very comforting!  Serve with a small salad and good bread for an excellent week-night meal.

This was amazing! Comments were that it tasted like high end restaurant quality. A little bland at first that's why I gave it 4 * , so I added a little minced onion, grated carrot, minced garlic, garlic powder, dash of celery seed to the broccoli as it was simmering then at the end a teaspoon of Tony's Creole Seasoning (no extra salt or pepper) a dash of Crystal Hot Sauce for some zing.

This recipe is the best I have found to date.  I added 6oz cream cheese and about 2 cups of grated cheddar cheese and reduced the water from boiling the broccoli!  Oh so good!!

Comfort food at its best!  Creamy, cheesy...  Great!  The only things I changed was to mix broccoli & cauliflower florets, and to pulse it in a food processor.

How can you not rate it a five star, when you change the recipe?  This made for a great base to a broccoli cheese soup!  I made some of the changes that other people had suggested (bacon, half & half, & real cheese). Also, I can't stand frozen broc. so I steamed fresh broc., same effect. Then, I served it in little onion bread bowls. Yummy! It totally hit the spot, I will be making this again!

This was great and super easy.  I decided to make it and had it done within about 15 minutes.  I just used 3 cups of milk, and put the 1/3 cup of flour in while cold.  Then I melted the cheese and added the salt, pepper and vegetarian flavored chicken stock.  I also used real chedder cheese because I always have that around.  I had to finely chop my broccoli or it would have been in huge hunks.  I will chop it down more next time.  After adding the broccoli water it was thin so I sprinkled on some cornstarch and let it come to boil to thicken it up.  That worked great.  I ended up adding more salt and pepper to the finished product.  But, to make it in 15 minutes from stuff I always have around is what makes this great!

Everyone loves this recipe. I used grated cheese instead of processed. I steamed 1 cup of fresh broccoli and put it in my blender with 3/4 cups water and chopped it there before adding it to the soup. That's the water I used, the blender water. It was great. I want to eat it every day!

Delicious and easy to make. I add chopped onion & med - fine chopped carrots to mine for color & flavor.
I thought my base was a little runny, will dump less of the water into mix next time
I also used 3 bullion cubes in the recipe.
I will definitely make this recipe again!

I was reluctant to make this, because although I love broccoli cheese soup, my husband has never cared for it, and he said so!  He said he would rather have a PBJ sandwich than this soup for dinner tonight! Well, I wanted it, so I whipped it up (So FAST-faster than the half hour it calls for!) and served it with little sourdough rolls that I hollowed out and filled with the soup. Guess who ate more than me?! Thats right...my husband couldn't get enough of the stuff! He said its definitely a keeper! I used real shredded cheddar, reduced fat for the cheese, but did put in a few cubes of velveeta. I'll probably leave that out next time though, as I don't usually have it on hand. The Cheddar was excellent though. I would also recommend draining the broccoli first, then mix the soup together, then add water at the end to get it the consistency you like. Mine was too thick at first, like a cheese sauce, but a cup or 2 of water was all it needed. YUMMM!!!

What a great recipe!  This soup was quick & easy to make, with practically no clean-up afterwards. I used low-fat milk & reduced-fat cheese and also omitted the heavy cream, and it still turned out to be delicious and filling. I also added a few fresh mushrooms to the broccoli when it was cooking, just because i had them on hand. I served this soup as a main dish with a side of cornbread, and it made a great dinner on a chilly evening.  As an added bonus, it didn't hurt my budget!

My fiancee and I really enjoyed this recipe. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I drained about half of the water out of my broccoli before I put the soup mixture in, and was still way too watery! Other than that, it was delicious! 

(Also, we added four cups of shredded cheddar rather than two and a half cups of cubed cheddar, and that was definitely the right way to go!)

Very quick and easy. I boiled one boneless chicken breast until done with chopped onion, a dash of celery seed, garlic powder, tsp sea salt and dash of pepper. I cooked the broccoli with it. In the milk mixture, I added a pinch of nutmeg. Shredded my chicken breast into the cheese mixture.

I tried this recipe today.  I used extra bouillon cubes, added onion, and subsituted cheddar cheese for processed (I hate processed cheese).  It came out very thin and beyond bland.  I will be trying a different recipe next time.

This was a last minute choice when I realized I didnt have the salad I wanted to make for dinner. I didnt use the processed cheese I used cheddar and I subbed evaporated milk for the heavy cream. I used 2% milk. This was ok I changed it based on what I had on hand. I thought it was salty but nobody else mentioned it. I served it with home made garlic croutons, a half baked potato each and leftover cucumber onion and tomato salad.

This turned out SO good! I used 2 heads of fresh broccoli vs the frozen, 1 large chicken bouillon cube (what I had on hand) and a 1lb block of Velveeta.  It didn't need any salt or pepper.  It was perfect! 
I cut the broccoli up in little pieces, covered it with water and boiled it for about 10 minutes.  I reserved 2 C of the broccoli water after cooking, in case I needed to thin the soup.  Didn't use any of it.  I think next time, I'll actually take more of the water out.  It was a little runny but still tasted great!

I haven't made this kind of soup for a long time and couldn't find my receipe, so checked on here and found this one.  I just finished making it.  I had a little tester and it was delicious!  I didn't measure my ingredients, just eyeballed and tasted.  I didn't use any chicken bouillon cubes as there are a couple ingredients in them that I am allergic to (also why I had to go back to making my own soups). My husband doesn't like homemade soup, especially if it has anything green in it!  I have found someone to share my soup with - my grandson's girlfriend.  I texted her to see if she liked this kind and what a response! - she loves it!  Hopefully I will find more soup receipes on here that will be just as good.

I didn't have cheddar cheese like so many reviewers recommend so I made it with what I had, shredded mozzarella and provolone. I drained the broccoli as most reviewers said it was soupy. But everything else was followed as stated. IT IS THE BEST BROCCOLI SOUP I HAVE TASTED!!! And I love broccoli cheese soup and order it almost at every restaurant that serves it.

This is a great tasting broccoli soup. I didn't have the cream on hand and used milk instead. It was still delicious in my opinion.

I used a generic Velveeta for this recipe. I used roughly 16 oz cut in to cubes (as best you can do with Velveeta). I also added NO MORE THAN 1/2 the water from the broccoli to keep the soup thicker and creamier. I also added a splash of A-1 and/or worchestshire sauce. This is an easy, easy soup to make. I have mad eit twice now, and I think my wife wants me to make it at least once every week or two.

Very yummy, my husband had two big bowls. The heavy cream killed my stomach though. I'll be making it next time with a different variation, that leaves out the cream.

This was the best! I have made several different receipes trying to find the one closest to Quiznos and this is it. I made it just as the receipe says and wouldn't change a thing. It was a hit and will be one of the commons for this household.

This recipe was not to my liking. The only thing I did differently was use fresh, steamed broccoli instead of frozen. Oh, and I made my roux the correct way because it'd have gone lumpy if done the way directed in the recipe. Way too much cheese in this, it was too thick and had a weird mouth-coating feel. We tried it and wound up adding a LOT more milk to it to make it even edible, and it was still just too heavy and thick and extremely salty.

Awesome!! I love it!! Only made half a batch.  Used 3 cups of colby and monterey jack cheese (thats what I had) because its a milder cheese, 2x the broccoli and only enough water to make it to the consistency that I like (1/4-1/2c) I like it really thick. :) ...and per other reviews added the flour before I heated the milk to make it smooth and added sauted onions.  DELICIOUS!!

Great recipe though I made a few changes to make it even better. I added an onion (cooked with the broccoli), used a 16 oz bag of frozen broccoli. Cooked the veggies with the boullion cubes (2). Mixed the flour into some of the milk before heating to prevent lumps, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Added 2 cups of mild cheddar cheese. Very Yummy!

We enjoyed this a bunch. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I didn't measure my broccoli or chicken bouillon base stuff, and I added more seasongs (dehydrated onion, dehydrated chives, garlic powder, black pepper). I served it with hot turkey sandwiches & red pepper jelly. I personally prefer this kind of soup made with cheddar but Velveeta is what was on hand, so I'm glad I gave this recipe a try!

Excellent, cheesey soup!  It is pretty rich with whipping cream, so I make it with extra milk instead.  And I use fresh broccoli, cooked in the microwave steamer.

I sent this as my son's lunch to preschool and all three of his teachers want the recipe.  Not bad, huh?  OH, and I had to make two batches in one weekend because I ate practically the whole first batch by myself.  
Only, I NEVER use the Velveeta/processed cheese.  I used Cheddar, and  in the first batch I threw in a little Colby/Jack mix and in the second batch a slice or two of Muenster.  Add whatever you like, but I recommend basing it on Cheddar.  Also, for my little guys, I smash up the broccoli before adding it so they wont freak out with the chunks and balk at eating the most healthy part of this soup.

I just made this soup, and I am disappointed.  I should have not added very much of the water (from the broccoli) at all.  I strained off some, but not enough.  My soup is watery.  It looked so good before I added the broccoli and water.   Oh well, if I try this again, I will add the broccoli first, then slowly add water.

Yummmm. Definately a five star recipe. I tried this recipe and it was great.Being in the hotel industry my husband's opinion is valued the most in our family. He liked it too. I made a slight change in the recipe though. I dint have cream , so i added little bit of coconut milk powder instead. Believe me it worked out great.

This was a quick and easy soup to make. I added a total of 4 chicken bouillon cubes and also sauted about 1/4 onion, chopped, in 1 tbls butter first. I also used half and half in place of heavy cream. I wanted it a little thicker so I added a small amount of cornstarch/water mixture. It was quick and very good.

Rich and delicious and oh so easy.  I added some green onion and used pre-grated sharp cheddar cheese.  Didn't add the broccoli water because I wanted it really thick.  I served this to company and they raved about it.

I sauteed some diced onion and celery in butter, added the flour to that and made a rioux.  Added a box of chicken broth to that.  I had frozen broccoli/cauliflower blend, so used that and it worked out fine.  Ran my immersion blender thru it.  Used less milk and cream since I'd used the box of chicken broth.  Use fresh grated sharp cheddar (don't care for the other).  It was great with these changes.

I made the sauce and it came out the right consistency but when you add the broccoli and water it becomes way to runny. So after playing around with the flower to bring it back to the correct consistency I had to add more bullion cubes and other seasonings to give it flavor. I love the end result but next time I know to drain most of the water off before adding the sauce. Plus I used fresh produce and real cheddar cheese which I think helps with the flavor.

Just made it. I used 1 cup of heavy cream, 2 cups of milk. I cooked my broccoli and then blended it up so it was thick and puree like. I didn't use the boullion, forgot that part! Whisked the cheese in slowly, and added broccoli puree slowly, adding broccoli water when too thick. Turned out really nice!

This was a very pleasant soup. I made a few adjustments.  I left out the bouillon so I went a little heavier on the pepper.  I used 16 oz broccoli which I think worked well.  I followed Amanda's recommendation to add the flour to the cold milk with no problems.  I substituted shredded sharp cheddar for the processed cheese. I'm looking forward to a yummy lunch tomorrow!

That's A LOT of cheese. It kind of takes over, flavor-wise. I love cheese, don't get me wrong, but the velveeta flavor is so strong you don't taste the broccoli much. My soup wasn't thick at all once I combined the broccoli in water w/the cheese sauce. Bummer. Wish I would've drained the broccoli completely before adding it into the cheese sauce.

It wasn't creamy enough. Recipe should have been a little more discriptive. For example the flour should be mixed before with the water so it doesnt clump. also u have to put extra cheese then what it calls for.

Amazing! I made a few alterations. I used fresh broccoli & 2 cups shredded cheddar & 1/2 colby jack cheeses. Being a vegetarian, I also used vegetable boullion instead of chicken. It's soooo good!

Just made this for my lunch, not alot of work involved and turned out pretty darn tastey. Changes I made, added 1 chopped shallot with the broccoli to cook.  Used a full block of Velveeta cheese.  Didn't have chicken cube so used a pork cube.  After combining both pots, ran it through the food processor.  Added some cayenne pepper to finish it off.  On my second bowl added some bacon bits.

I really liked this soup.  I thought it tasted good.  However, my husband, said he could taste the velveeta and the cream, and that it possibly needed more salt.  It was very easy and quick to make.  I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches.

This recipe was a huge hit at my house!!! I tasted really cheesy and just like the Quiznos soups but a little better!!! The only suggestions I will make is add an extra chicken boullion cube without it the soup is a little bland.  After it's all together add some Tony's...it gives it a little kick!!!

should have chopped the broccoli a bit (the chunks were too big for our liking and would have blended the flavor better) and the texture wasn't as creamy... but i think that's my fault. maybe i should have sifted the flour first? i'll definitely be making it again thought -- special request of my husband. thanks so much!

Excellent soup. My first time making broccoli and cheese soup and I wanted something easy and delicious! Exactly what this was. I did take the other reviews into suggestions and I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added a bit more broccoli, added a little bit of beer and an onion. It was SOOOOOOOOO good! I definitely recommend this to everyone!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added a little bit more cheese and pepper to it.  This soup was easy and quick to make and my kids loved it.  I hollowed out large rolls and filled them with soup and the kids got a good kick out of that.
