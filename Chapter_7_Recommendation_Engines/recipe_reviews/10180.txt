Sooooo delicious. These cookies are awesome! It's so refreshing to find an oatmeal cookie that can stand up on it's own without the addition of raisins.

5 stars for sure.  I love making cookies and this reipe is a keeper.  I did half the recipe and chopped up milk chocolate kisses, ghiradella semi sweet chocolate and some nice dark chocolate.  It was a nice treat to go all out and use the good chocolates for these cookies. I'm sure using average chocolate would still make a great cookie.   I did cream the butter and sugars then added the egg and vanilla and gradually added in the flour mixture with blended oatmeal.  I dropped by heaping tbsp onto sheets(didn't flatten with a fork) and needed to bake for 9 minutes and they were perfect.  6-8 minutes and they were too raw and not ready to come out yet.  Thanks!

I made the full recipe because I needed lots of cookies for Easter; I made the recipe as directed except adding another half teaspoon of vanilla, and about half a teaspoon of salt (it's really important). Because of the chips I used, I also used about 3/4 tsp almond extract. I used a cup of cherry chips, a cup of raspberry chips, and 2 cups of bittersweet chocolate chips. These were full of chips, so I skipped the german chocolate chunks on top. I made good-sized golfball scoops of dough, and the cookies spread just enought without spreading into each other, so they maintained a good thickness. I found I had to bake them for about 9 minutes, though, and my oven bakes hot, so I think I must have made the cookies a bit bigger than recommended. The ground oats give a really nice texture and subtle nutty taste to the cookie. I really like the dough and think you can use the dough as a good base for several different kinds of cookies. On another note, I used my kitchenaid mixer, and the cookie dough really almost overflowed, so be aware of that; I might make it in halves next time.

These were OK, but I thought they were too sweet. I'll probably make these again, but I think I'll cut down on the sugar a little and use all dark chocolate chips, no milk chocolate. Also, I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton of cookies.

These came out great! Halved the recipe. Just used some milk choc chips and some semisweet. Baked for 9 mins. I think I would give 5 stars if they had a teeny crunch to them or something - but they are really good as is, soft and almost fluffy.  I used a bit less sugar than it called for, the flavor is yummy.

These are delicious. Soft and chewy from the ground up oatmeal. I usually half the recipe, and bake for 11min.  I think my oven is a little on the cooler side, but I think would require minimum 9-11 minutes baking time or it will be too raw. I might add some chopped up walnuts for some added crunch to contrast the soft chewey cookie.

WOWSERS!! I have pitched my old chocolate chip cookie recipe and am keeping this one! I did 1/2 a batch, and used 12 oz. dark chocolate chips and 6 oz. milk chocolate chips. Absolutely killer cookies!

Very good cookies.  I took them to a gathering of friends, and they were rated   
 5 stars.  It makes a very large batch, which is not a problem around here!

I work out of town 3-5 weeks at a time.  I left some of these cookies in a ziplock bag when I left for work. I came home 22 days later and they were STILL soft!  Fabulous!  Make them just the way its written, they are great.  Love the extra nutrition of the oatmeal.  Very satisfying!

These cookies are very good, however, I added 3 cups of brown sugar and and no white sugar and they turned out perfect. Also when processing the oats I found it really helpful to also process the butter with it, make sure the butter is warmed though! The serving size was actually right on, that's a first!

Wonderful!   I made it as stated however I had to cook it longer about 12 minutes. I did also get realize I didn’t have a blender at my friends house after it was too late so I sifted sifted and sifted so I did half fine and half rolled oats. Still made a fantastic cookie.  This is my new favorite cookie and everyone one else’s!!  I suggest ding about half. This was a little too much.

The cooking time listed was WAY too little.  The first batch was a gooey mess.  The second batch, which I baked close to 15 minutes, turned out much better.  I did not add any additional chocolate to the top of the second batch but still too much chocolate for my taste.  Also, these cookies are more like little cakes than cookies.

Really good recipe.  Followed it exactly as directed.  It wasn't too sweet like other reviewers have mentioned.  I would double the amount of choc chips so each cookie will have a lot of chips!!

I tried this recipe and it was by far my favorite but I only gave it 4 stars on account of it turning out dry......any suggestions on how to moisten them up a little???? Over baking maybe  the culprit??? Lol I don't know what I did

Very tasty! I suggest adding Flax seed for an even healthier alternative that makes it taste even better. We also added walnuts and extra oats. Also, if your dough seems a little loose to roll, try letting it sit in the fridge until it firms up.
