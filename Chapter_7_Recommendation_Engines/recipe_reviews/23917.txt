This marinade is good and quick.  Couple of warnings though, the brand of steak sauce and dressing you use can drastically change the flavor of your marinade.  I have made with both A-1 and Heinz 57.  I prefer A-1.  Also, I recommend using a zesty italian dressing.  It gives your meat a little more kick.  
This makes a lot of marinade and I used half right away and frooze the other half in a zip lock back with steaks for future use.
Final word of warning, be careful this burns easy with the honey in the marinade.

I used A-1 steak sauce, Delmonico steaks and marinated 48 hrs because we had to go out the night we planned to have the steaks.  Don't know whether it was the quality of the meat, the long marinating time or the recipe, but this was the best steak sauce I've ever had, no question.

One 15 oz. bottle of A-1 sauce equals 1 1/2 cups of steak sauce.  I was a little apprehensive of the recipe, because I do not normally use steak sauce.  I was afraid the sauce would overpower the flavor of the steak.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I marinated 3 large T-Bone steaks for 6 hours.  After grilling, they were very tender with a mild sweet flavor.  My husband loved them!  Thanks Kristen!

Very good steak marinade - my husband is a huge fan of A1 so we had to try this. I cut the recipe in half for a good sized sirloin. I still used 1 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce and Kraft light italian dressing. I also used 1 clove of minced garlic from the jar vs. garlic powder. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. Perfect with a baked potato!

I have made this recipe several times and each time I get many compliments!! I add a TBSP of teriyaki sauce. I put the marinade and steaks in a ziploc baggie and let them sit overnight in the frige. We learned that you have to watch these steaks cook on the grill very carefully as the honey (we think) causes the steaks to burn if unattended. LOTS of flavor!!! My four-year-old didn't breathe between bites! 

Kudos Kristen!

Fantastic!  I made my own steak sauce using Worsteschire Sauce, ketchup and dijon mustard then added it to this recipe and it was great!  Thanks!

This was great! I didn't measure the ingredients, I just guessed at the amounts.  Also used a Balsamic Vinaigrette for the dressing.  Will be using this recipe again.

My husband used this recipe on NY Strip Steaks at our last supper club that we hosted which consequently was an "I LOVE NY" theme party to honor the victims of NY and everyone at our party - 6 couples loved the steaks and said these steaks were as delicious as steaks at such nice restaurants as Sullivans and Ruth Chris.

This recipe really made a difference in the steaks.  We will always use this any time we grill steaks!

This is a great marinade!  The combination of all the ingredients really work well.  Very easy to make, and all the ingredients are commonly used, so you won't have to run to the store for an ingredient.

This was sooo simple to make!  I didn't let it sit for 24 hours, about 6 hours was all I had.  But it was WONDERFUL.  My husband didn't even use steak sauce after the steaks were done.  Yummmmmm!

This is very yummy.  I use Worcestershire sauce b/c I always have it on hand.  I also only marinate for a few hours or it can get a bit too sweet for me.  Here is my adapted version for two steaks, the recipe as is makes a LOT of marinade.
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
3/4 tsp Soy Sauce
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp Italian Dressing
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp Honey
1/8 tsp Garlic Powder

This recipe was a really hit at my 4th of July bbq with my family.  Everyone thought the steak had a great flavor and was really juicy.  I used petite top sirloin steak and let them marinate overnight.  They were great! I used the tangy italian dressing and added a dash of worchestersire sauce to give it a little more kick. My husband loved it so much he had me make it again for the bbq we had with his family the next day.  That time the steaks only marinaded for 5 or 6 hours so they weren't quite as flavorful.  I would recommend leaving them in overnight to get the best flavor.

wanted to try something different with my steaks tonight, so I tried this.  It was good, but not awesome.  I tasted more steak sauce than anything else.  I will go back to making steaks the way I usually do.

As another reviewer said, "Move over Outback". And I agree. This is awesome marinade. We loved it, and it made our tri-tips soooo tender and flavorful. Next time I am going to try adding 1t of black pepper because we enjoy pepper steaks from a Gourmet grocer here in Seattle. I believe this may be similar to their basic recipe without the pepper.Thanks for sharing.

This marinade is AWESOME.  I am making it for a second time.  This time I am using tip steaks, and adding mushrooms to the marinade.  Once done (before cooking I will wrap in bacon and Broil for 20 minutes.  I cant wait!!  Again great recipe. The first time I just used plain steaks and was very tasteful!

O.K., so my hubby Drew came home with Ostrich burgers tonight! Who would have thought? We've always wanted to try them as we're big Sunday afternoon cooking channel viewers. They're 97% fat free, so I figured they would need a marinade of some sort to help make them more moist. Believe me they did, and this was excellent! The flavors were wonderful Kristen and we thank you!

Really great flavor! Our steaks were too big and we used the leftovers for sandwiches the next day. The flavor still held up and tasted fantastic! Bravo!

WOW!!  I tried this recipe last night with NY strip steaks...it was amazing!  The recipe says that it is for 2 steaks..our steaks were huge and it was more than plenty for 4.  I tenderized the steaks a little first and put the meat and marinade into a 2 gallon ziploc overnight.  Do take caution when grilling as the honey can make the steaks burn easily.  I seved this with baked sweet potatoes with maple-jalepeno sour cream and fresh steamed green beans, garlic bread and a great salad.  It was a complete hit! It is a great change from regular steak. Very tender.  Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

This was fantastic.  The only thing that I recommend is to scale it depending on how much you need.  I had just over a pound of meat (3 filets), and half of this recipe would have been plenty.  Also, I marinated for 24 hours, I would probably do it for less time so it wouldn't be so powerful.

This is awesome!  We're always on the search for new marinades for our meat.  This was so yummy... I didn't have enough steak sauce, so I used worcestshire to make up the difference.  It's now a favorite in our house.  Thanks Kristen!

I tasted this before putting the steaks in it and ended up adding a lot more soy sauce, more garlic, and some liquid smoke, still too much steak sauce taste for us.

This IS an awesome marinade! I used A1, marinated it for over 24 hours and it turned out beautifully. This recipe worked well for 5 large steaks and my guests were fighting over the last one. Thanks for this scrumptious recipe Kristen!

Excellent.  I made 1/2 recipe for two fair-sized sirloin steaks and it was just right.  My father, a major meat-eater and very picky, loved it.  Cannot get a better review than that, believe me.

This really is awesome. I found that making only 1/2 of the recipe was enough marinade for 4 steaks. I marinate in a ziplock bag so the good flavors cover every inch of the steak.

This was a great marinade.  A+ all-around.  I had to vary it slightly, but it was still great.  I used 1/2 c steak sauce, 1/3 cup Italian, Soy Sauce and Honey.  I used 2 cloves mince garlic, 2 T lemon juice, and 2 T olive oil and blended all ingredients with a hand mixer.  
Very good. Definitely will use in the future.

Indeed, this was awesome and quoting my roommate "Watch out Outback!" We let marinate overnight, almost 24 hours and the meat was very tender and flavorful. I was skeptical as I rarely use steak sauce (but keep some around for my family who does) but none was needed tonight...the taste was flavorful enough! Will be keeping this recipe! Thanks!

This recipe was a hit at my table, since my husband is a meat and potatos guy, I marinaded 6 beef tips, and they were the hit of the evening. I even cooked the ribs in the marinade and the ribs were so tender, almost could have used a butter knife.

I liked the marinade very much.  I like not having to search for expensive or hard to find ingredients.  I may not make it again for the whole family because my husband felt it was way too sweet.  Me being a "recovering sugar addict," enjoyed it a lot.

This was excellent!! I used A-1 the first time and felt that it wa a little over powered but the second time I used Country Bobs Steak Sauce and it was PERFECT. I think that if you even tried it with the different A-1 flavors it would be good...it would change it up a little. It's all about the steak sauce you use that makes or breaks this recipe. Great combination of ingredients and even my picky 11 yr old loved it and wanted more. Thanks

This was not a favorite here.  The taste of the steak sauce completely overwhelmed the other flavors.  We have other steak marinades that we like much more.  Thanks for posting, though!!!

Love it....have made this several times with the same results. All that have enjoyed it, ask for the recipe. Another very easy marinade to prepare. Only change is I only use 1/2 cup of A1. Just can't say enough....it's tasty. Thanks!

I made steak kabobs yesterday for Fathers Day in this marinade, wonderful flavor!  I agree with another reviewer that the steak sauce brand is important, I used A-1. and don't skimp on the honey.  I used eye of chuck steaks and I marinated them overnight.  I made extra marinade, boiled it then thickened it with corn starch and served it as a sauce on the side, what a hit!

I didn't find this marinade much different from marinating in plain steak sauce, which overpowers all the other ingredients in this recipe and the flavor of the meat. I think this might be good with a inexpensive cut of meat, but if I'm serving porterhouse, t-bone, etc., I want to enjoy the beef and not the marinade. I'll not use this recipe, again.

Good steak marinade.  A little sweet for my liking - I think I will cut the honey back to 1/4 cup next time.  Other than that - it was good.  My husband enjoyed it just the way it is!

This was okay for me. Maybe because I cooked in on the George Foreman grill.  But I did use NY strip steaks and let them marinate over night and well into the evening of the next day.

This was a total sucess at my last dinner party.  The only change I made was using Balsamic Vineger dressing rather than Italian dressing. It tasted great and I will use this again. I'm glad someone else has mentioned boiling the rest of the marinade and using it for a dip, good idea!!

I thought that the sauce was too overpowering,I had cut down the A1 to one cup and added 3 tbls worcestershire sauce. I simmered the extra sauce , ten min. It made a alright dipping sauce. could not appreciate the taste of the steak. may need brown sugar?

I split the marinade and put it on steaks and boneless pork chops. The steak was pretty good (we usually grill with a few spices and no sauce), but the chops were excellent. I will definitely use it again and also try it on chicken.

This is a great marinade but the only drawback is that it is a little expensive.  It tastes great and for a special occasion I will use again.  Thanks for posting.

This was pretty good. I regret not having a better cut of meat to use this marinade. I heated the leftover marinade until it was boiling and then we used it to dip our steaks. I'm going to make it again and use sirloin.

It's an average marinade.  I didn't like it because it was too tangy.  If I use it again, I'll add Worcestshire sauce and just a little Italian dressing.

I just have to say this is the best stuff ever.  I am going through the bottled steak sauce like crazy just to create this marinade.  Excellent on t-bones etc...  I'm thinking of trying it on salmon even.

Loved this marinade. I used NY strips and only had time to marinade 4 hours. I used fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic powder. I will not cook another steak without this marinade. Thanks Kristen

We really like this marinade, even my 7 year old loved it.  I didn't use as much steak sauce as called for, I used some from a local restaurant and it's very salty. So I didn't use any soy sauce.  The honey gave it a great taste..not to sweet.  I finally found a marinade the whole family likes.

This is a great all round marinade. I used Country Bobs all purpose sauce as another reviewer suggested in place of just regular steak sauce. I've  used it with a T-Bone and Beef Ribs and the results were excellent. Highly recommend it

I used A-1 steak sauce and ribeyes.  I actually froze the steaks in the marinade till we were able to grill out a few days later.  These were the best steaks ever!  Very tender and flavorful!

I cut back on the honey and use worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. I also add a little dijon mustard. Very tasty!

Everyone loved this marinade. I marinated chicken breasts and t-bone steaks, then boiled the rest to make an tangy sauce. I subbed half the steak sauce (Heinz 51) with barbecue sauce and it tasted awesome.

I've used this recipe a few times and every time I make it it gets better. I do agree that the steak sauce makes all the difference. I've used store-brand sauce A1 and just used Jack Daniels steak sauce. So far the JD is the best. I also added some brown sugar and onion powder and this is by far the best marinade we've had.

This is really great.  It takes a lot of steak sauce so I buy the bulk A1 at Costco. I have yet to get honey so I have been using sugar...they are not equal measurements so you have to add to taste.

We had been given some cheaper New York Strips and dreaded grilling them.  So, I tried this marinade on them and let them sit for about 4 hours. WOW!!!  This marinade could make the worst steak taste the best. It made them very tender and juicy, no steak sauce required while eating these!

MMMM!! I used this for my steaks tonight. My husband just got back from China (he was there for 2 weeks!) and he was missing some steak and potatoes. I'll admit, I didnt follow this recipe exactly... but almost. I forgot to pick up honey at the store so I just left it out. It was STILL really good. With the honey it would probably have been a knock out. I'll be using this alot- it was tangy but sweet but salty. YUM.

This marinade lives up to it's name! I live in Peter Luger country and while everyone says that's the best, I find it too vinegar-y.

This was absolutely perfect and I can't wait to make it again. I plan on wowing all our guests at our summer barbeques!

I used a flank steak and let it marinate overnight. Then, I boiled the sauce and served it on the side.

It was fantastic - very flavorful.

Pretty much just tasted like A1 steak sauce.  I like A1, but as a large part of the marinade it pretty much overpowered the natural taste of the steak.  Not horrible/not great either.  I have definitely found better alternatives, so I won't be making this again.

I used this recipe for a sirloin tip roast.  When it came time to pop it in the oven I used the recipe titled "Herb Rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast".  The combination of the two created THE BEST Sirloin Tip Roast we have ever had!!!!!!

This was great!  i didn't follow the recipe exactly but used what I had in the kitchen (a mostly full bottle of A-1)and even my grandmother who doesn't like any other seasoning except salt, pepper and a little garlic powder loved it.  That's saying something.

Great combination of flavors that really compliment steak.  I used chopped garlic instead of the powder and added a bit of green chili sauce to kick up the  flavor profile a bit. Awesome!

We definitely liked this recipe but thought that it was a little heavy on the steak sauce and we agree with other postings that it becomes a bit expensive to use a whole bottle of A1 in the marinade.

Love it.  Although I cut the recipe way down for 1 night.  It just makes too much sauce otherwise.  I add a little 'Veri Veri Terryaki' to it and it gives it that finishing touch and makes the gravy too good to waste.... I made some biscuits and we sopped up every bit!

i added some lemon grass, finely chopped fresh garlic and lemon juice and just a pinch of salt on each steak brings abit more flavor. turned out great, definitely use it again but without honey, i wonder if it'll taste the same on lamb chops

Wow this is very good! The whole family enjoyed it and we will be using it again! I also took the advice from one of the reviews and boiled the left over marinade and used it as a dipping sauce which was an excellent idea. May try on chicken and pork chops. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

I thought this was an expensive marinade.  You end up throwing away the whole thing after you soak your steaks in it.  I also thought it used way too much A1 sauce.  It wasn't a bad marinade though.  I just wouldn't go over board and say it's the best I ever had.

This was pretty good. Though I'd add a little more tanginess to the marinade, worchestershire or (my favorite) pickapeppa sauce and less steak sauce. I also added lots more garlic powder and regret that I shouldn't have grilled the steaks as long.

I don't like steak, but my husband & son love it and they rated this marinade a 10. I only used 1 cup of steak sauce, maily to save a little money, and it still turned out great!  Thanks.

Im a tough grader and I don't normally give 5 stars, but this one is that good.  I loved this one, make sure you dont make too much marinade for the amount of steaks you are serving as it can be a little pricey.  Make sure you marinate the steaks for at least 2 hours before cooking. Yummy!

This was absolutely the best marinade I have tried.  I made this for my husband's birthday and it was awesome!  I used del-monico steaks and only marinated it about 4 hours, still wonderful!

I found this recipe at the last minute while scrolling through looking for something to make.  I didn't have italian dressing so I used my own recipe for that and added all the rest.  The steaks were N.Y. strip and they were so yummy.  Moist and delicious.  They cooked up wonderfully and that sauce was the added zing they needed.  thanx!

Quick and easy used my Magic Bullet to mix. Used HP sauce, fresh garlic and eliminated the honey- no flare ups. My grandson said "Nana you make the best sauce" and doesn't normally like steak.

My entire family loves this recipe! I have only tried it with A-1  Steak sauce but that is the only steak sauce we like. I did try 2 different  types of Italian dressing. One was the Kraft Zesty Italian and the othe is Ken's Italian Dressing Marinade. I found that the Ken's dressing is by far the better choice! The Kraft changed the taste dramatically and I can't  say that it was for the better. And absolutely  love how juicy, flavorful, and tender the steak comes out!

Extra tip: I also tenderize and poke holes  in the steaks on both sides with a fork. Also tried receive without doing this. It did not absorb the marinade very well at all.

We set up to use this marinade on two eye round steaks on Thursday, but my husband got called into work late, so they marinaded for more than 24 hours. The flavor is amazing! However, my husband and I agree that it's missing a note of flavor somewhere. We think it needs just a touch of an acid, like lemon juice, to make it perfect. Also, wish I had read the reviews about it burning on higher heat because of the honey, because it was good and charred on the outside and rare on the inside. I guess we'll be better advised for next time!

I tried this tonight and it turned out great. I only had half of the 1/3 cup of honey so I added imitation maple syrup to top it off. I marinated the steaks for 24 hours and cooked on the grill with hickory charcoal. Very tender and very little of the sugars burned.

Made exactly as written, halving the amount as I only had two smallish steaks.  I used A1 Steak Marinade Classic Steakhouse for the steak sauce, Chiavetta's Italian dressing, and Oishi Genen Shoyu Premium Low Salt Soy Sauce.  Marinated the steaks in a zipper bag from 8 PM until noon the following day, then grilled them.  I realize that one's preferences are subjective, but to my palate, they were outstanding.  I'll definitely be using this again!  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

This was fantastic - I was looking for a steak marinade that didn't have a teriyaki flavor, and I was really glad to find this one.  An overnight soak made our meat so tender and flavorful.  I used half the recipe, and it made a lot.  I will use this many times!

Although I did not have Italian dressing, and had to use Sundried Tomato instead, my husband loved the marinade. We made it for Fathers Day and he considered it quite the treat for our T-bone steaks!

OMG!!!!GREAT on steaks.  Entire family went nuts for it.  I made my own steak sauce from a generic www.allrecipes.com recipe as I was out.  Only able to marinade for 2 hours and it was just perfect on the strip steak.  Our new favorite recipe for grilling.  I loved the honey, however, if you desire a less sweet flavor forgo that ingredient.

We really enjoyed this marinade and are constantly looking for new ways to enjoy steak.  My only change for next time would be to use slightly less steak sauce, as we felt it somewhat overpowered the other flavors.  With a small modification, this would be fantastic.

This marinade is a winner!  It was easy to make and used ingredients I keep in the house.  I used a little less steak sauce than suggested.  My husband had no issues with the meat burning as others had mentioned but we cook on low heat for a longer amount of time to prevent this.  We will be using this recipe again and again.

I used this today last minute to marinade some thick sirloin steaks. Only thing I did different was add a little dark beer to thin it out (mine was really thick, like BBQ sauce....every other steak marinade I used before has been thinner) I salt/peppered both sides,
poked holes in the steaks with a fork and poured the marinade over them. Smells good. 

EDITED TO ADD: This wasn't strong enough to use on the thick steaks I used. I suggest if you plan on using this, use thinner steaks.

This was absolutely a great recipe, the steak melted in your mouth. We used Lee&Perrins Steak sauce and Kraft Italian dressing along with 5 tri-tip steaks OMG!!.. we were wanting more steak. I only marinated our steaks for 5 hours, next time I'm going to make extra sauce to put on after. Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe. It does call for a lot of steak sauce so I would suggest using a store brand but, A1 does taste better. You can use this with a cheaper cut of meat to really liven it up.

This really is awesome. I have made other marinades but this one takes the prize.   The longer you marinate it the better the flavor. I didn't have any honey in the house so I used 1 tsp of molasses.
Great recipe, definite keeper.

This was a good steak marinade.  I will probably only make when A-1 is on sale, since it is an expensive marinade to make otherwise.  It did taste good though, and my cheap steaks were tender and yum!

We really liked this. I didn't use that much A-1 (was running out) so I made a smaller amount. Used less Italian and more garlic. Also just threw it all in a large baggie & smooshed. Much easier than cleaning the blender.

I only had 1/3 cup of A1 sauce and I put too much italian dressing.  I used mini steaks.  I didn't like the taste, my husband said it was "different" but my in-laws LOVED it (my mom in law is the pro-cook so for her to say that, it was great. I would use it again but have enough A1 sauce on hand and use 1/4 cup of italian dressing cuz it can overpower the other flavors.  I used corn starch to thicken the sauce and it was good as a gravy.

Pretty good.  I used minced garlic and fresh ground pepper.  I marinated for almost 24 hours and I thought it could have gotten into the meat a little more.  Also, it was a little too sweet. If I try it again, I think I will leave out the honey.

Very tasty.  Cut down on the amount of steak sauce (used Jack Daniels brand) and did not use the blender (I hate to clean it!).  Next time will add fresh garlic.  Both kids & husband liked it!  Thanks!!

Very good but not sure it warrants using a whole or half bottle of A-1.  I'm still going to be looking for something as good and more economical.

Very easy marinade...decent flavor but nothing over the top great.  Would use again but it does use a lot of steak sauce which I didn't like from a $$ standpoint.

Other than being too sweet, this was a good marinade.  I will cut back on the honey next time.  I will use it again, but probably only on cheaper cuts.

Very good marinade, I used it on a cheaper cut of steaks because I was trying to get rid of the steaks. The marinade not only left the meat very flavorful but very tender, I was very impressed-thank you.

Reduced the steak sauce considerably and I used a combination of three different kinds. Didn't fool with putting it in the blender, just mixed it up and put it on some ribeyes. They only marinated for about an hour and they were great tasting. I can only imagine how good they would have been if they had marinated overnight.

This marinade tasted pretty much like A1 steak sauce to me, but I like A1 so I thought it was good.  I will definitely try this sauce again, but I will probably try some ideas by some of the other reviewers.

This tasted a little too much like steak sauce.  It's a good start, though, and by messing around with the proportions, you can make a great marinade!  On the advice of another reviewer, I added a little zesty italian dressing, ketchup and worcestershire.  Next time I will add even more worcestershire and less steak sauce.

Excellent recipe!  I used A1 marinade in place of the steak sauce. Our steaks were tender and delicious! After marinating, I boiled the sauce on the stove and then used it as a dip with our steaks. Yummy!

We halved this recipe, and still had enough to marinate a ~1 lb steak, plus reserved some for basting.  We marinated for about 2 hours, then grilled out, and the result was perfect -- very flavorful, but not overwhelming.  We used Kroger Bold & Spicy steak sauce, which added a little kick.  Great recipe, we'll definitely use it again!
