This was quite tasty, especially with fresh basil and tomatos from the garden.  I added some thin sliced red onion which was a plus and used frozen pizza dough, which was not great for this recipe.  I probably used to much of the cooking creme, 1 tub of it will cover two pizzas I believe.

This was very good! I added more veggies, like mushrooms and red bell pepper. Such a great flavor! I couldn't find the ready-to-use crust, so I got dough from the refrigerated section. I'll totally make it again.

Quick, easy, and delicious - perfect for lunch or a snack! I used a Boboli bread shell and I loved the combination of fresh tomatoes and basil.  I added a little fresh garlic and a pinch of kosher salt to the tomatoes and overall this was very tasty!

Really easy to make and tastes great.  I used frozen pizza dough and it turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used dried basil instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand.  No one in the house other than my husband would finish it after more than a couple bites.  The flavor of the cooking cream overpowered every other taste and just wasn't appetizing.  I won't make this again.

This was delicious! The only adjustment I made was adding a little bit of pizza sauce to the cooking creme- this made for a very tasty, creamy tomato sauce! My husband and I loved it!
