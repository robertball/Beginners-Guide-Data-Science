This was a wonderfully easy recipe to follow. However, I made a slight change of my own. I doubled the sauce recipe and poured it over the raw seasoned chicken and cooked it in the oven at 350 for 30-35 minutes. The chicken was cooked in the sauce and came out juicy and full of the creamy garlic flavor. YUM!!

My review is for the sauce, we grilled our chicken using our own favorite recipe. The sauce is a nice topping for grilled chicken, a little bit sinful, but nice and cheesy garlicky. I reduced the recipe for two people, didn't use vegetable oil, just the butter, and used half and half and 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese.

This was wonderful! Used fresh dried herbs crumbled over frozen chicken breast, drizzled with olive oil & thrown in the Foreman grill. I cooked some brown rice in chicken boullion, then added the cooked chicken, covered with the sauce, voila!  Awesome, we all loved it.

Wife and I absolutely loved this.  As another reviewer suggested, I used the 1/3 fat cream cheese and I used fat-free half & half.  We like garlic, so I used 3 tsp. of chopped garlic. This sauce stands up on its own and I'll use it on pasta in the future.

Amazing! I made it according to directions, which was great, and then I made it another time with modifications. I pan-seared the chicken, then used the same pan to build the sauce. I made some fettuccine, tossed it in the sauce, sliced the chicken an put it on top with some Parmesan. I think I preferred the modified recipe, but I liked the original, too.

I thought it was much too thick and rich but my husband liked it. I won't make it often due to the high calorie content.

I seasoned the raw chicken a bit more in a baking dish. I added adobo, garlic salt, and siracha seasoning, and cayenne pepper along with the other seasonings the recipe calls for. I then melted double the amount of ingredients in a pan, using light butter (instead of full fat) and olive oil (instead of vegetable oil). Next I added flour, garlic, pepper, low sodium chicken broth, fat free cream, and low fat cream cheese. I seasoned the sauce with some pepper and then poured it over the chicken in the baking dish. I cooked it for 30-35 minutes in the oven on 350 degrees.  I served it over steamed green beans. It was one of the best meals I've ever made. Enjoy!

It is really rich. I made it exactly as listed here and put it over a grilled chicken thigh. The flavor is good but I think next time I'll skip the cream cheese.

Terrifically easy sauce recipe with graceful taste. It added life to the grilled chicken. My husband and I enjoyed this sauce and grilled chicken over a bed of green beans steamed in chicken broth. My husband is not a fan of sauces and gravies but, surprisingly, he said "this is the best sauce I've ever tasted." He's right.

Awesome for a quick meal! The only changes I made were to use 1% milk over heavy cream, it still came out delicious! I also added parsley to the seasoning of the chicken.

My husband thought this was good but a regular chicken dish and gave it 4 stars.  I thought it was delicious and gave it 5 stars.  I’m the cook, 5 stars it is.

Tasty. Only 4 stars because I used milk instead of cream to save on calories.  Also needed a bit more spicing up for our taste so sprinkled a bit of cayenne on top of chicken/sauce.  Served on a bed of spinach for a complete meal.

Made only the sauce. As with any gravy or sauce, be prepared to add extra liquid to thin it to your preference. I added a sprinkle of Savory Spice roasted garlic, salt & pepper as I like a heavier garlic flavor. I put it over spinach, swiss cheese & bacon stuffed chicken breasts. This will be a staple sauce for me now.

Absolutely delicious! I made the chicken in the oven with rice and poured the sauce on top. covered it with aluminum foil and baked at 350 degrees for 1 hr. Rice was really good. Im going to cook noodles and add them next time to see which i like better. My husband said it was so good it was evil.

We sautéed some mushrooms, peppers, and onions in a touch of teriyaki and smothered steaks with everything. SOOOOO GOOOOOD!! I didn't have pure Parmesan on hand, but used a shredded mix of parm, asiago, and a couple others.

I like this recipe because the chicken and the sauce are made separately. This is helpful to those people that are watching their weight and don’t want to put the sauce on the chicken. Oh, and btw, it tastes great with or without the sauce!

Love it! It's so much more than just a sauce for chicken. I think it would be fantastic on linguine. The only changes I made- I finely chopped 1/3 of an onion and added it with the garlic. It is rich, like an Alfredo but oooohhh sssooo goooood! I have 4 boys, 5 counting my husband, and they all loved it too, so it's kid approved!

I followed the recipe of the sauce but doubled it and added lemon juice and green onions... I also used Tuscan marinated chicken and grilled it then made a Normandy blend of veggies with squash,carrots and broccoli and cauliflower.  The combination of all three flavors was to die for. My husband said he felt like he was enjoying a meal in a restaurant.

I also substituted 1% milk for the cream, Neufchâtel instead of cream cheese and used cornstarch versus flour to make it a little healthier.

Very rich, but great. I followed the reviewer's suggestion (scjpoirier), simply because I was too lazy to use the grill. It came out great, but I could only eat a small portion, as it is so rich. I will make it again, but will pull out the grill next time and use it more as a dip.

I needed a substitute garlic cream sauce for something else & happened upon this one. It was so tasty and will now be a staple sauce in my house. I might try the chicken at a later time.

Very solid and good recipe that both tastes great and plates well.   I followed the recipe to a tee and served over  herb flavored basmati rice with a side of asparagus.   I made the recipe for only two people, but made a full batch of the sauce because it looked like it would be good.   I saved the sauce for alfredo sauce.   Excellent.

This sauce was a huge hit! It certainly would pair well with pork, too. I used grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil and it turned out just perfect!

I followed the recipe exact.  When I got done, I had to add seasoning to the sauce. It was pretty bland in my opinion. I added pepper, garlic powder,  and cracked Italian seasoning blend to taste. It was pretty thick so I added chicken broth a little at a time to a desired consistency.  I will make this again with my modifications and I will probably cut back on the cream cheese as well or omit it completely and only use fresh grated parmasean. Over all it was good and easy. Thank you for sharing!

I haven't even tasted the chicken recipe yet, but that sauce is to die for! Next time, I'm going to add a little more flour to thicken it up and turn it into an alfredo sauce for pasta.

I made the sauce and it is a winner.  The taste and consistency is similar to Alfredo.  The cons are the number of ingredients and steps that go into it.  I wouldn't consider making this after coming home from work, but I will make it again on a weekend.

This is an outstanding recipe. I adjusted it for two, butterflied two breasts and cooked over real wood charcoal. The sauce takes this dish to a different level. Definitely a keeper. Thank you Kari for sharing!

it was ok. hubby said the sauce had no flavor. i think it could have used maybe some white wine, but what i really thought was missing was lemon. not sure if it would have worked, but while eating it, thats the flavor i felt was missing.
