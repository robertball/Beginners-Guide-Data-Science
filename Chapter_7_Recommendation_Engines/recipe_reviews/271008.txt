Kids love these cookies! They are fun looking and fun to eat! I will warn you cut up jelly beans before starting. That will take more time than anything else in this recipe. I only chopped up 3/4 cup of jelly beans and I am glad I didn't go to 1 cup. I think next time I might go for 1/2 cup. It just depends if you want more jelly beans than cookies or smaller amount. Nothing else I would change. I cooked them 9 minutes. Great for Easter!

These were quick and easy to make and so very yummy.  We will definitely be making these again.  They are sweet so be warned if you don't like really sweet things.

I will make it again but I may add some coconut which I love.  I used gourmet mini jellybeans and didnâ€™t have to cut them in half.  Delicious,

I did the recipe exactly, I liked it.  
Next batch I used sour patch kids, and shortning instead of butter. I liked those better.
 This is a good cookie recipe by itself.  Next weekend I'll try chocolate chips.

Made as directed  with one change. Used Gum drops  also known as spice drops. Very good.
