*****READ THIS REVIEW FIRST*****
THE RATIO OF WATER TO SUGAR IS INCORRECT.. THATS WHY MANY GOT MOLDY CANDY.  THE RATION IS 4 CUPS SUGAR TO 2 CUPS WATER.   I USED SQUARE TUPPERWARE CONTAINER... NO LID-- JUST LOOSE CHEESECLOTH OR FOIL.   DO NOT MOVE CONTAINER.. WAIT ONE WEEK.    JUST FINE...HOPE THIS HELPS

EVERYBODY! If you get moldy water, try these things:

Instead of a skewer, use cotton string or dental floss.
Cover jar with something lighter.
Use the ratio 2 Cups Sugar to 1 Cup Water.

If you try any of these things, and they work, post it here!

I would give this zero stars if I could. Rock candy is supposed to be a supersaturated solution when you mix the sugar and water together. That means you should have more sugar than water not equal amounts of both. Of course, when you leave sugar water out it feeds bacteria, just like if you would leave meat out. The main thing is to try to make sure everything is as sanitized as possible and go for a recipe that has a sugar:water ratio of 2:1.

Recipe worked rather nicely, and the addition of just a touch of candy flavoring oils was great. **IF you're getting moldy water, try using a lighter weight cloth over your bottle. Whatever rag used was too heavy to let the water evaporate right. Cheese cloth works best!

All of you for whom this recipe did not owrk. I do not believe you did anything wrong. I know a lot about cooking and I have never had to re- try a recipe three times with this one I did on the third time I gave up. I tried a chees cloth it sat there for a month (kids waiting patiently) not one thing happened. I even tried the seeding method she suggested. I just feel like the amonts aren't correct or sometrhing. If you all have had the same problem there must be something wrong with the recipe.

READ THIS BEFORE MAKING IT!
The reason many had moldy water is because the ratio of sugar to water was wrong. You want the water to be supersaturated, so you'll need a 2:1 sugar to water ratio. You have to heat the water in a saucepan to do this. You also do not want to use foil or plastic wrap to cover it. You need the water to evaporate some and it'll take longer to make the crystals. If you use a tupperware container, rock candy will form on the sides of the container and they're really hard to get off. Don't forget to 'seed' the skewers/string by rolling sugar onto them. However, you'll need to have the sugar water cooler than room temperature so that you don't just dissolve the sugar.

As a kid my brother and I made this all the time.  We used a piece of string (or a few pieces of string to make more) and I don't remember ever covering it.  We never measured how much sugar... just poured some in.. maybe a quarter c/jar..  and we never got mold.  The string started getting crystals after just a few days but we left them in longer to make them bigger. This recipe is a lot of fun, but I htink it just needs more sugar!

i did this differently , you will need: a jar, a pencil, string, 4cups sugar, and 2 cups water. dissolve sugar into water and pour into jar. then tie a piece of string to the pencil so that when you lay the pencil over the top of the jar, the string is in the water! leave alone for a few weeks, and then there you have it, perfect rock candy!

This was the first thing that I'd ever "cooked" by myself - it was done as one of my first science projects in the late 70's.  It works just as well 30 years later.  =)  Flavoring oils really do enhance the experience now, though.  I *love* this in orange and vanilla flavors... definitely use a light cloth over the top of the jar, cheesecloth works best.  A very fond memory revisited.  Thanks for the reminder.  =)

I have tried this recipe (and several others) with not much success. I'm sure the concept is there and maybe it's just me but I couldn't get it to work. I didn't have a problem with mold, just ants. They were after the sugar big time! I gave this a 3 cuz' I'm not sure if it's me or the recipe. Sorry.

This recipe was absolutely terrible.  I found this recipe for my kids' science fair project. They were observing the growth of rock candy. Like some other reviewers said, the ratio for water to sugar was way of I found another recipe for rock candy on PBSKids.org and their result using that recipe turned out perfectly! WARNING: Don't use this recipe!!!

I was reading everyones reviews and I think the main problem is not enough sugar but also that when its being made it is not being heated enough. We learned in 5th grade that the crystals are formed by liquid that is heated to its extreme and then cooled slowly.

Well I did 2cups sugar 1 cup water with a decent splash of peppermint oil. I took a paper towel and a pony tail band and made a good tight seal around the top of my chinesse take out bowl. It's a 4inch by 6 inch tall plastic container. I had a stupid idea and put popsickel sticks in the solution, I removed them b4 they could get moldy! I'm sure wood is a bad idea in water.

This recipe left me with nothing but dissappointment and 6 cups of sugar & water down the drain. i had my hopes to atleast see some crystals growing and after a week there was mold. The person that wrote this recipe obviously needed to add every detail, that worked for her, i wish she would rewrite her recipe or just delete it. Next time i will read the reviews.

As I was in the process of rolling the strawberries in the red colored sugar, my mother walked into the kitchen, right up to the table, looked down.  "Where did you get the strawberries, humm, did'nt know we had any."  I explained to her what they were, and how I made them.  "hummm, smells like strawberries too".  I thought to my self, what a nice compliment to this recipe.  Oh yes I will use this over and over and many different flavors and colors.  Two thumbs up

Moldy water here. I read the reviews first and thought for sure I could figure out how to make it work. Nope!

Recipe didn't work for me...I'm going to try again though and use more sugar.  I don't think there was quite enough to "super-saturate" the water.  I'll use more sugar and heat it longer than I did the first time.

Does the temperature of the room make a difference? I just started with another recipe for rock candy, and it looks like the whole thing is solidifying in the bottom of the jar with nothing different going on with the stick. The room it's in is on the cool side. I wonder if maybe the temperature of the room has something to do with this, as well as the mold issue some people have experienced.

This didn't quite work for me, but i'm close. i found another recipe that called for 2c water and 4 c sugar. i used stawberry flavoring and red food coloring.  i also "seeded" bamboo skewers with sugar before placing in the solution.  I used a large mason jar and i covered it with wax paper and put a rubber band around the brim to keep it one, i then stuck the bamboo skewers through the top of the wax paper and secured them with clothespins.  It sat for two weeks, crystals started forming after the first week but not as big as regular rock candy.  I found i had more crystals growing into the bottom of the jar than i had growing on the skewers.  The candy tasted really good but the crystals were a small size.  Not sure what i did wrong but i know i'm close to getting this right.  any suggestions let me know!
