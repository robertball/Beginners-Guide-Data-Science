I made this though we are not gluten free here so I used regular flour. I also added 2 diced carrots and a cup of chopped okra in with the celery. I also doubled the spice to 1 teaspoon each. Turned out great. We served it over brown long grain rice with some butter. My brother added a bit of hot sauce but it was good for my son and I.

This recipe was great!!!! However the file powder is hard to find in stores and is best to be ordered online however no file okra is a great substitution. I doubled the spices for this recipe I recommend season to your liking. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I still achieved lots of flavor. I will be making this again really soon.

I thought it was really good for a quick gumbo. I cooked bone in chicken thighs with a cajun spice rub in the cast iron skillet first took them out and made the roux in the same skillet with a little extra oil and regular flour. I also used boxed chicken stock. This reduced the cooking time to an hour and 20 minutes.

Delicious and easy! Used turkey sausage and quinoa instead of white rice. Very flavorful - will definitely make again!

I chose this recipe because it seemed simple enough. The roux took 40 minutes of stirring not 10 min. I think it needs to be spiced up. But otherwise it is a good basic recipe.

I ve never used GF anything but cooking for a friend. I couldn t find the millet flour so I used a Pillsbury gluten-free flour. I am from cajun country where we make gumbo all winter long. I couldn t believe how good this recipe turned out. The only change I made was to brown the flour before I added the oil. It goes a little faster for me and easier to control. I have splashed roux on my hand before (ouch). Granny told me to brown it first. Anyway love the outcome of this recipe.
