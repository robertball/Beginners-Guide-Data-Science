I'm giving this five star for a very simple reason that someone could come up how to use tempeh in a sandwich. I come from Java, Indonesia and I grew up eating that as a cheap substitute to meat. usually, I would just slice them into 1-1.5cm thick, marinate it with watered down mashed garlic and salt, and fry it til golden brown. We eat it with warm rice or as a snack.

Thanks for a nice casual meal recipe.  My kids, who had been very resistant to even trying tempeh, asked me to make these again!

I made them just as described, and they turned out good.  I made these on a Saturday before we left for a busy day of errands, and it satisfied the kids for hours.

I didn't have either sesame oil or liquid amino acid supplement, and I wasn't sure what valid substitutions would be, so I used what I had on hand: canola oil and flax seed oil.  I may not have gotten all the intended health benefits, but it tasted great (and I got my omega-3's to boot)!

Delicious. I used less jalapeno than recommended, but used a spicy tempeh from the vegetarian section of the grocery store. Liquid amino is just a vegan type of soy sauce, so substitute soy as necessary. And I was out of soy mayo, so I used light Miracle Whip.

Its unusual for recipes on this site to be as bad as this one.

I followed the recipe exactly, BTW ( I love Temeph).  
Recipe was too salty with the Amino's.  

I will finish it but never use this marinade again. Yuk!

These are awesome! I used tamari instead of amino acids.  I also added some sliced portabella mushrooms to the green pepppers and onions.  They are a big hit for both kids (omitted jalepeno) and adults!
