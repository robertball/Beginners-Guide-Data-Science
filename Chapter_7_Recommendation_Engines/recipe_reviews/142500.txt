This takes too long to make.  I have a tried and true mac n' cheese recipe, so I rarely try others.  But this one sounded so good that I couldn't resist.  Unfortunately, it's not as good as it sounds.  I didn't have any cayenne so I used paprika.  Don't think it made much of a difference.  I thought one cup for breadcrumbs was a bit much but I went against my instinct and used the entire cup.  Big mistake, because it was a big factor in ruining the recipe.  All you could taste were breadcrumbs; seriously, it was like eating a mouthful of gravel.  Also, I used 12 oz of macaroni instead of 8 because it really didn't seem like enough.  Either 12 oz is too much or 30 minutes is too long to bake the dish because it was really dry.  Could hardly taste the cheese; like I said, all you could taste were breadcrumbs.  I used a large, sweet Mayan onion and I thought it would be too much, but after the onion carmelized for 1/2 hour it shrank down to almost nothing.  If I make this recipe again (and that's a BIG IF) I will use only 1/2 the breadcrumbs, twice the onion; if I use 12 oz mac I will add 6 oz shredded jack and definitely will not bake it for 30 minutes.  More like 15, probably.  What cheese and onion flavors I did taste underneath all those crumbs did not impress me.  I also didn't think the broth was necessary.  I would use 1/2 n 1/2 or more milk.

I loved the concept of this recipe. I also agree, cut the bread crumbs in half. I added about a 1/2 cup of white wine also. I didn't delete anything, just added the wine with the other liquids. It was divine when it was just sauce. My small kids loved it. Then we put it together and added the bread crumbs and baked. The three of them said, "too many bread crumbs, can't taste anything else." So cut the crumbs in half, add the wine, and Bon Appetite!

Mouth-watering just thinking about it! This is the best mac'n'cheese I've ever had, and it's not that difficult to make. Definitely not anything like stove-top varieties- in taste or prep. I would say the prep time on here is under-estimated, but most of your time will be spent on the roux, building it into the cheese sauce.
As suggested by other reviewers, use HALF the breadcrumbs and don't waste your time on browning them.
Also, I have made this recipe a few times with cooked and crumbled bacon mixed in before baking- Mouth-gazm! If you're watching your fat or cholesterol, then don't do it, but otherwise... yum

Although it took a bit of time...I really liked this recipe, and will make it again.  I did add some swiss cheese, as well as using cream instead of milk.  The caramelized onions had a great flavor!

This recipe works. Takes too long? Kinda standard for real mac & cheese. Plus the time for the grilled onions. But that's my favorite so I think it is worth it. I also grilled some stir-fry pork pieces and deglazed the pan with some white wine, adding that to the sauce right before the cheese. Freaking good. Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with previous reviewer's complaint of too much bread crumbs. Hubby complained that the bread crumbs overpowered/detracted from the mac and cheese, and I totally agree. The caramelized onion flavor is nice. I doubled the amount of cheese. Did not taste the mustard or cayenne at all. Previous reviewer is right on target with eliminating the chicken broth and just adding additional milk - I bought a can of chicken broth and used just a partial amount which was a waste of money; I can't see where the chicken broth enhanced the recipe at all. Without the caramelized onions I'd give this 2 stars, 3 stars if you halve or delete the bread crumbs - the caramelized onions bring it up another star to a 4.

This was pretty good.  After reading other reviews, I doubled the onions and halved the breadcrumb topping.  I should've let the onions cook a bit longer though-after 20 minutes, they were very soft and sweet, but not very colored.  Instead of the chicken broth, I used all milk and added some organic chicken base.  Next time I will add a few splashes of Worcestershire.

I thought this was very tasty, although I could have used more onions and less bread crumbs. I think this would be a good meal for young, picky kids and a good way to sneak some vegetables (onions) into their systems.

I made some changes based on the ingredients I had available, but it resulted in one of the best mac & cheese dishes I've ever had! 1) I caramelized three large onions with no sugar, and it took an hour (caramelizing onions is a long process - if you're not prepared to saddle up for an hour or so with a book in one hand and a spatula in the other, this recipe might not be for you, but if you are up for the investment of time then you will be rewarded with a truly flavorful dish!).  2) I caramelized the onions and cooked the pasta the night before.  3) I only had about 1 1/4 c milk so I used half & half for the remaining 1/2 cup (I believe this added richness to the dish. also more calories but it's freaking mac & cheese, duh). 4) I used a cornucopia of cheeses: 1/2c swiss, 1/2c aged yellow cheddar, 1/4c gruyere, 1/3c parm.  5) I used garlic butter to toast the breadcrumbs and make the roux.

I liked it, nice change from the plain Mac and cheese.  It didnt make that much, I baked it in a 8 by 8 pan, and used crushed ritz crackers on top.

This is a great Mac n cheese recipe. It makes a delicious, savory and flavorful baked Mac n cheese that outstrips any other Mac n cheese I have tried. Is it a lot of work? Yes, but it is so worth it! I have made it numerous times and will continue to make it. It is my go-to Mac n cheese recipe.

I made this for Christmas for my husband and parents (so an easy bunch to try a new recipe on for a holiday meal.) While I think this is a good recipe, it takes a long time to prep. Also, cut the bread crumbs in half (a cup is way too much!) and it would be better with more sharp cheddar cheese. If you make it, plan on a decent amount of prep time (and a bunch of dishes)!

I really liked this.  For a large Christmas dinner, I scaled it up quite a bit, so that might have been part of it , but I agreed with other reviews about the quantity of breadcrumbs (too much) .  I thought the onions were a touch too much as well, but that might have been that I used onions that were too large or something else.  I found the final product to be wonderful, rich and creamy, not at all dry.  Will definitely make this again, will probably become a Christmas tradition.

This is one of the best Mac and Cheese recipes. I didn't even use have the bread crumbs as everyone mentioned. I mixed up the cheese a bit and used some cream with the milk - my man LOVED it. Give it a try!

I couldn't agree with DC_Lady any more!

Use half the breadcrumbs (or less), and double or triple the amount of onion.  I agree that the stock seemed pointless, and I like the idea of using Jack cheese or perhaps mixing cheeses.

This recipe was dry, dusty, and flavourless.  

For a little more creativity, I'd suggest adding some colour, perhaps using sweet red peppers, and sprinkling with paprika?
