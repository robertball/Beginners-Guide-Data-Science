I thought these tasted fine. Although, the texture oddly sort of reminded me of frozen meatballs. I suppose that is from the breadcrumb amount. I did think some of the ingredient amount seemed a bit off. I halved both the seasonings and used 1 cup of chopped spinach. I added 2 pinches of salt and 1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese. I realized it called for Italian seasoning after making them and so I rolled them in 3~4 pinches of Italian seasoning. I used 1/4 cup measuring cup to divide the mixture. It made 10 meatballs. I baked them on a foil lined sheet sprayed with cooking spray. I also sprayed the meatballs with olive oil. They took 30 minutes, to bake, turning about every 10 minutes. The meatballs came to 99 cal each as made.

Absolutely loved these! I used only 1 tsp of the garlic and onion powder and it was perfect for us. I also used frozen/thawed chopped spinach. I used 1/2 c. though 1/4 would be great if you have to hide it from the kids, but 1/2 c. was not overkill. One review mentioned dryness so I cooked half the time covered with foil, then removed it second half to brown. I used an 8x8 baking dish and the result was 16 meatballs. They were juicy and tasty. These were even better for lunch the next day. Will be a regular at our house!

These meatballs are delicious and healthy. I substituted Panko bread crumbs and added my own Italian seasoning; I used frozen chopped spinach and probably used about 1/2 cup.  My husband put gravy on his.  About 21 carbs for the entire batch this way without the gravy.

After reading every review, I made the following changes: eliminated the powdered onion and garlic and replaced it with fresh garlic, onion, green pepper and cilantro. I added a little Worcestire sauce, salt, pepper, dried parsley, dried oregano and Badhia all purpose seasoning. Kept the egg and fresh spinach as they were, and replaced the Italian Style breadcrumbs for Garlic and Herb breadcrumbs. Added half a pack of cream cheese, and about a 1/4 of a cup of three cheese italian shredded cheese. Baked it as it was suggested, covered half the time and uncovered for the remaining time. I finished them by cooking  for 15 min. in low temperature on a pool of  spaghetti sauce. They turned out AMAZING!!!!!!

It's lacking the salt and pepper and asks for too much dry garlic and onion. I added 1/4 tspn of salt, pepper to taste and a tspn of each, garlic and onion. Additionally, I am not a fan of Italian seasoning, so I added a tspn of smoked paprika. The temperature I baked at was 400 and I followed a suggestion of another reviewer (to prevent dry meatballs, & they came out nicely moist): I placed the balls onto a piece of foil and covered with foil for the first half 12 minutes and then uncovered for another 15. The total cooking time was almost 30 min for me. I put in for longer bc I'm in the mountains (Denver) & also bc I made them large. As big as my palm. They do taste great and thanks for the great base recipe!

This has become one of my go-to recipes. I just tweaked the recipe a bit, adding a touch of fresh rosemary. On occasion, I replace the bread crumbs with a slice of day-old bread dipped in milk. One tip to remember that was passed along to me by my Italian great grandmother: When mixing everything together, use a light touch. The more you handle the meat, the tougher the meatballs will be.

Tasted salty.  My wife pretended to find it tolerable but it wasn't good.  I even halved the spices but it still tasted too salty.

Sorry very newb, this is the third part of my review! According to tips, sprayed the pan and the meatballs with olive oil spray, covered with foil for 15 min, uncovered for 10 min, while boiling two cans of crushed tomato sauce, and when the meatballs came out, we stuck them in the sauce and continued to simmer for about 5-10 min (since we weren't sure if the meatballs were ready). So soft and juicy and flavorful. First review on this site after years of using. Thanks for getting me started. :) Healthy-ish turkey meatballs.

These things taste awful!! Don't trust the other reviews. The amount of onion and garlic powder makes the dang things horrendous. The spinach adds a bitter flavor to it. Don't make the recipe as-is. Gross!!

It's OK like I will eat it... but not make it again. I thought the meatballs were dry and not sure how to fix that... fresh garlic? onion?

I find myself looking for ground turkey recipes as we transition away from beef, this one will be in my regular rotation.  

I made some changes by halving the onion and garlic powder, I also used a big handful of fresh spinach. When chopped, it was almost a cup.  I also used 20 oz of  ground turkey from Aldi.  Somehow it worked because I got raves.  I will also turn the meatballs in the oven next time.  

I may experiment with frozen chopped spinach and possibly use minced garlic and onion to replace the powder.  But this is a very quick prep and cook time, so it’s perfect for weekday meals.  I did allow the meatballs to cool at room temperature for a bit before I added them to a pot of jarred spaghetti sauce.

My Toddler loved this- so a winner in my book. I followed advice of pp by decreasing the amount of onion and garlic salt by half and added a generous amount crumbled Feta. Prep was super fast but needed appx 30min of cook time rather than the recommended. Will become a regular meal in our house!

Turned out great! Timing and temperature was all perfect ?? I had all the ingredients already. It's inexpensive, healthy and tasty! I tested four on a bed of 1/2 cup red kidney bean and 1/2 cup corn mix with Sriracha on top. Only 350 calories by my calculations!

The meatballs were very dry (could just be turkey) and I think there is way too much garlic and onion powder and maybe breadcrumbs.  Going to experiment and maybe next time it will be better.

I used 1/4 C gluten free oats, 1 t sea salt, and 1 T Worcester in place of Italian breadcrumbs. I used only 2 teaspoons each of onion powder and garlic powder.

Made it to take to a party and absolutely loved it!  Added some Keg steak spice and Worcestershire sauce to kick it up. Also followed the recommendations to use Panko instead of Italian bread crumbs. Paired it with some spicey Thai sauce and Greek yogurt Tzatziki for dipping.  When baking them we baked them for 20 minutes and then put them under the broiler for 5 minutes to crisp them up slightly.
