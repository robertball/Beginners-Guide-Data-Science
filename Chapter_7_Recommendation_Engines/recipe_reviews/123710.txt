So easy and yet taste so good! It's great when a few simple ingredients you have around the house come together for something so tasty.  These little biscuits bake up in a pinch and they're a great base for whatever add-in's you like. I added some Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning to one batch to go with dinner.  For another batch I added a couple teaspoons of sugar and they were great for breakfast with butter and jelly.  Nice little recipe to have on hand!

This was really, really easy to make. Plus, it doubles well. I didn't overmix the ingredients which made for a light, fluffy biscuit-muffin. It paired well with Creamed Eggs on Toast with Sausage, my son's favorite meal.

These biscuits came out wonderful. The recipe is easy enough for my 10 year old to make them herself. They are versatile enough to be used for breakfast(butter and jam) as well as dinner(cheddar or parmesan cheese and basil). I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is awesome and so easy to make!  The biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy. I added a teaspoon of sugar the second time I made them, as several reviewers suggested, and they turned out perfect!

These were VERY simple to make and did come out very fluffy.  I tripled the recipe to have enough for my family.  I prefer biscuits a bit sweeter so next time will add a tablespoon or so of sugar.  They were deliscious the next morning with some homemade apple butter!

These were very good and quick to throw together. I doubled the recipe and instead of adding plain salt I added garlic salt and some sharp cheddar cheese. Will definitely make again!

These biscuits were simple to make and so good!  I added garlic and cheddar cheese for a catering, and ended up having to make an additional batch; my helpers ate all of the first one!

This is my new go-to biscuit recipe!!  Fast easy - wonderful!  I doubled the recipe and rolled them out on a floured surface and used a 2" biscuit cutter it made about 12 biscuits.  They puffed up really high!  I served them with sausage gravy and they were wonderful.  The only thing I would do different is add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the mix - but other than that it is my new favorite!!

With no bread in the house and not much time before my sons got up I looked up AR for a simple biscuit recipe.  This was it quick and simple.  I did double and added 2tsp brown sugar to the doubled amount giving me 11 muffins. Will definitely be making again.

I must have another definition of the word "Fluffy".  These tasted good, but had the consistency of baked play dough.  I will try it again in case it was something I did.  I see that it has a lot of positive reviews

Yes they were easy enough to make, but they were also completely tastless. This Southern girl wants something other than just flour flavor.

Those were literally the easiest biscuits I have ever made.  They were so nice and fluffy.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly too, expect I decreased the temp to 400 and still baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfectly golden brown.  I will try to add things in them next time as well.  They went perfect with our brenner (breakfast for dinner) eggs sausage and bacon, yummy.

Very fluffy, very easy, moist inside, crispy tops, and very tasty. No rolling required. This was a dense biscuit perfect for splitting in half and picking up to eat. It did not crumble at all! These would be equally great with gravy too. I used light mayo and it worked out great. Thanks Virginia, these are as easy as Bisquick/package mix and I could even say I made them "from scratch".

I’m sorry to say that we thought these lacked flavor.  When making these, I was concerned because the batter was quite thin.  However, they did bake up beautifully.  I may try these again adding more mayonnaise to see if that would help.

These are pretty good for what they are; a 3 ingredient recipe.  Super simple.  Like other reviewers I would probably add more salt.  I plan to make them again.

Great recipe! Even my picky neighbour liked them! Instead of putting in muffin tins though, I kneaded into a dough with some cheddar cheese, then rolled and cut out into circles. They were super good and super easy!

My family and I loved this.  Good flavor and loved the texture. I doubled the recipe and topped it with homemade sausage gravy.  The next day I heated the leftover biscuits with butter and they were wonderful.

This is a remarkable and flexible recipe. It can be savory with the addition of garlic or cheese, plain or, with the addition of a bit more milk and a 1/2 cup of sugar, sweet. (I doubled the recipe for one batch, added 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup more milk and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. They were perfect. NEVER do I make something that turns out this picture perfect. I almost teared up they were so pretty. Martha Stewart is the new name I give to myself- lol! Thank you for this versatile recipe!

I have to admit, I was a complete skeptic of this recipe. I was making sausage gravy, and I didn't have enough heavy cream to make both biscuits and the gravy. I found this recipe and figured I might as well give it a shot. Well, let me tell you - these are AMAZINGLY good. I was delighted with the light texture and the ease of preparation. They are so airy that I think you could easily get away with rolling them on a floured surface to make into cut biscuits if that is your preference.   The only adjustment I made was to drop the temperature to 400, as per the suggestions of other reviews. 15 minutes was perfect for bake time.

These biscuits were delicious and fluffy! I am a college student, and this turned out perfectly in my dorm kitchen. Our oven is a little hotter than average, so I decreased the temperature to 400F and baking time to 12 minutes.

These were very good, I didnt have any of my muffin pans (lent them to a friend) so I just dropped spoonfuls of dough on the sheet. Turned out well, I would like to try with the tins though. I think they would be perfect!

Love this simple recipe! And they taste great and were fluffy, and so easy. I have made them 3 times already. It is just my husband & I , so it is great that it makes enough for the two of us. I love that it is only 3 ingred. When I went to make them the first time, I did not have mayo and was disappointed, but my husband told me to use his mayo(spicy), so I gave it a try and they came out wonderful.  Oh, I did sift the selfrising flour! Thanks so much for recipe, will use again !

This was pretty good considering that I didn't have to run out to get supplies. However, next time I will put a little bit of sugar in it to cover up the taste of mayo. I think it was the Duke's light mayo that was the problem.

These were so good. They had a nice crunchy outside with a really soft, delicious inside. Definitely a keeper.

I added a teaspoon of sugar, as the other reviews mentioned. My family loved them.

You definitely can not think of these as biscuits. They are the consistency of muffins. I added 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 TBSP of sugar like others have suggested. That did help the flavor, but because they were more like muffins, they still had a bland taste.

I was skeptical but these biscuits came out very well! Only four stars because they were a bit too savory for my taste, I would add a little sugar next time.

So easy if you actually use self rising flour. I used all purpose and was disappointed, then determined, I understood the meaning of the footnotes, and tried again. I'm SOOOOOOOOOO glad I did, these are wonderful!!! Worth making twice. Will make many more!

I LOVED these biscuit muffins and will be making them again soon. They were easy to make, very yummy and the leftovers reheated well the next day when we used them for little ham sandwiches for the kids.

I loved this recipe! Ive been searching for the right biscuit recipe for years without success until now! Whoever discovered that mayo can be used instead of the usual ingredients... I honestly feel you are a genius!!! I always have mayo around, its one of those things that we never seem to go without... now I feel like I can finally enjoy making biscuits. Since I found this recipe Ive made them 4 times. Each time with success. Last time I actually added a bit more flour and rolled them out and cut them... fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the bomb!! So quick and easy to make. Adjusts very easily if you want to do different flavors. I tried Blue Cheese and Sun-Dried tomatoes. Usually make 24 at a time.

Easy to make and with very few ingredients, but definitely tasted like real biscuits. I had my doubts because one of the recipe calls for mayonnaise of all things, but it worked... I tripled the number of servings and dropped them by the tablespoon onto a cookie sheet. One thing, though: it took much LESS than the noted cooking time to bake. Even at 9 minutes, I still managed to burn the bottom of the biscuits :(

Ok.. I must have done something horrbly wrong.  I made these and had such high hopes, but they came out like mini rocks.  The inside was nice and soft, but the outside was hard as ever, very crunchy.  The kids loved them, but then again they are 2 and 4.  I put a little butter and strawberry jelly on them and they went to town on them.  So atleast they didnt go to waste!  But I will not be making them again.  I am giving them a 2 because my kids did enjoy them.  But I am not sure if they enjoyed the "rocks" or the butter and jelly.  So I will give the benifit of the doubt!  Ill stick to the other recipe I found on here for fluffy biscuits.    Thanks!

This is a good recipe when you don't have the usual ingredients on hand...but certainly doesn't beat a flaky tea biscuit.  The flavour is good enough, but not quite right.  I didnt have self rising flour and used the baking powder substitute instead.  The flavour of the baking powder was a bit strong, and I will use a bit of sugar if I make this again.  Excellent texture though.
