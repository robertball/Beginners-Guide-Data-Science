Loved this recipe. I doubled it, but still cooked in foil. Next time I make 4 servings (or more) I will instead use a baking dish covered in foil.  It took less than 1/2 hour to cook.

This was the first time I'd ever cooked salmon so I was looking for a simple recipe.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe provided and I really enjoyed it!

Delicious and FULL of flavour! We used very fresh salmon which made the recipe that much more perfect. Definitely include some capers if you have them for a boost of flavour.

I made this recipe tonight for my bf and I. It was great! the marinade had just the right amount of lemon flavor, and was not overpowering. the fish was moist, flakey and flavorful. the capers were a great addition. next time i make, i am going to add artichoke hearts, and minus the peppers, just to change it up. Recipe will be a new favorite for salmon. Thank you!

Delicious! I used a not-so-great quality of salmon and it was still delicious, probably due to the marinating. I had some leftover and ate it the next day and it was still tasty and moist. I will definitely make this again, I'm already craving it and I've had it twice this week!

Thank you for a great recipe.  I fixed this tonight.  Left out the peppers because I don't much care for cooked bell peppers and used tilapia instead of salmon.   Other than the above changes and adding salt and pepper, I followed the recipe.  My husband said that it was "out of the park awesome".   Again.  Thanks for a great and really easy recipe.

This was really good and easy.  The marinade gave it a nice, bright flavor. I did add some red pepper flakes and also halved some cherry tomatoes and put them on top of the fish.

I will make it again. Great flavor, without detracting from the salmon.

Super buttery flavor and moist fish. Really easy to prep and bake--two very important things to a lazy cook like me.

My family and I loved this.  I put in extra capers and lemon, and some white wine.  I  cooked it in foil on the grill for about 25 minutes.  It was delicious, and we all agreed the red bell peppers were delicious.  I'll definitely be making it again.  So easy and yummy!

Loved this recipe! I was too hungry to wait an hour to marinade so I marinaded as I cut up peppers and cleaned and got everything else ready and it was still so flavorful. I added artichokes and they were the perfect addition!! Also added some ground black pepper to packet before sealed it up. With a side of cous cous, defintely making again!
