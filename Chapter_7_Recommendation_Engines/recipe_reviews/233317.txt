The first batch I made was good but I couldn't taste the heat at all and it did not thicken up.  The next batch I doubled the habaneros to 4 and included the seeds and all using 4 cups of chopped peaches (per the recipe in the pectin for peach jam).  It was perfect and a big hit at work.  The perfect marriage of heat and sweet.

Well, I should have paid attention to the "spiced" part.  I made this in August when the peaches were ripe and while my husband liked it, it was just too Christmassy tasting to me.  Couldn't really taste the peaches at all (and they were fantastic as I peeled and nibbled).  Also, the directions say to boil the pectin, add sugar, then boil again.  This is the opposite of what the pectin packets say (boil sugar first then add pectin, then boil again), and processing for 15 minutes was too long even at 5,000 feet, so the result is 11 jars of peach habanero sauce.  We will use it, but it isn't jellified.  Oh, and one final note ... I had never handled habanero peppers before.  I didn't wear gloves to de-seed them and about an hour later I scratched my eye with my fingernail.  It took an hour of flushing my eyes with saline and milk before the pain went away.  Totally my fault, just be careful.  Holy cow that was a painful lesson to learn.  I will try the recipe  again but next time without as much allspice and I will follow the directions on the pectin packs so that these set and will update.  Probably next year.  Good luck!

Delicious! As another reviewer mentioned, mine also did not set up and is more of a 'syrup'. I'll still use it because the flavor is wonderful, but I'm suspecting that it is the cooking method (adding the pectin before the sugar), that is the reason why this did not set up properly. I was tempted to do it the way that it says on the pectin package, but I wanted to stay true to the recipe. I'm still giving this 4 stars, b/c, like I said, it is delicious and had a really nice, flavor with a nice, spicy kick, which we enjoyed. If I try this again, I will follow the cooking method on the pectin package. Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! I used 4 Cherry Bomb hot peppers from my garden, and 1 less cup of white sugar. I pureed half the peaches with the  peppers in the food processor, mashed the rest, then blended it all together. My peaches ran about 3 to the pound, for those who don't have a food scale handy. I love cardamom, so always have it around. That flavor crept through, just like I had hoped it would. This is a great recipe, and I was happy to supply a photo. Thanks, Kiki!

Made this as written except: didn't use the vanilla bean or the cardamom (I was too cheap to buy them for one recipe.)  It turned out great anyway (probably  a little less depth of flavor tho).  Just the right amount of kick after the sweet!  It will, indeed, be fabulous in baked beans at the next tailgate party!

I made two batches of this today.  It obviously has not had time to sit for a week like the recipe says, but I had a little leftover from one batch.  I put it in the fridge and tried it a couple hours later.  The consistency and flavor are awesome!!

fantastic flavor... came out more like a butter.  I wonder if I used 3 lbs of peaches, then diced; instead of 3 lbs diced if that would have made the difference

I made this recipe this afternoon.  Followed the ingredients exactly.  I have 7 jars of a thin sauce, I guess you'd call it.  Since others have had this problem, it seems like the recipe may need some tweaking.  If anyone has a suggestion for what I can use this for now, I would love to  hear.   The taste may be ok, but what to do with all of these jars.

Really good but i wish,  instead of saying "3 1/2 lbs peaches", it had said how many cups of fruit.  I had to guess how much sugar and pectin to use. And i didn't have a vanilla bean or the cardamon do I just left that out. But i do like the mix of white and brown sugar.
