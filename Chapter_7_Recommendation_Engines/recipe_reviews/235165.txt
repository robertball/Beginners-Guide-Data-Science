I gave this dish five stars for flavor and presentation.  The aroma as it baked was heavenly wafting through the house.  I boosted the oven temp to 375 for the first 30 minutes for the initial roasting, then reduced it to 325 until the drumsticks were done.  There was a large amount of liquid in the pan that never cooked off, so I will reduce the honey, orange juice, and butter to half of what is called for the next time I make this.  There would still be plenty of pan juices left for a thin gravy if desired.  In the directions, I think that the butter should be melted first, then brought to room temperature.  It will harden in the mixture when refrigerated, so it will be clumpy.  All in all, a nice departure and a great way to use an inexpensive cut of chicken.

These are my favorite types of recipes, ones that can be made with things I already have on hand. I made this just as written, the only change was that I only used about half the honey because that's all I had. I also used fresh squeezed juice since I didn't have any OJ but I had a bag of oranges. It took the juice of 3 big oranges. This came out so flavorful and delicious! It's definitely a keeper.

It was delicious.  I didn't use orange zest ,but used lemon zest. Family said it was finger licking good. Will be made for Rosh Hashannah.  We did not find it too sweet at all. Use some sauce over chicken flavored rice and not a drop left.

Made with a whole roast chicken, baked as any other roast chicken.
Used less than half the amount of honey, and used olive oil not butter.
Added carrots to the roasting pan under the chicken.
Tasted very good, orange flavour came through beautifully in the carrots and in the gravy, less potent in the chicken itself but still delicious. Keeping this one for so much flavour acheived so easily.

Made this tonight and all I can say is WOW !!!  I cooked this according to the directions and the chicken browned to a  beautiful caramel color.  I didn't have orange zest on hand and had to sub dried rosemary for fresh, but everyone was very happy with this.   Thickened the juice with cornstarch in a saucepan to make a sauce for rice and that worked quite well. The only drawback was I only cooked 4 leg quarters for 4 people and I wish I had made more....everyone wanted seconds!!!!!    Definitely a keeper recipe.

I cooked this for the first time today and it is awesome! My husband loves the sweetness of it! And this will be one of our favorite for dinner! I actually cooked the chicken in 350 skin down for the first 15mins then turn the skin up and cook it for another 40mins to 325 this time and rubbing the sauce on the skin every 20mins. Then I took all the juices and put some chicken broth butter,flour salt and pepper and made some gravy out of it! And it is perfect dinner in and hour!

Used boneless, skinless breast as that was what I had, so reduced cooking time accordingly (25 plus 20 minutes) and used lemon zest with the orange juice mixture rather than orange zest.  Tasted great and very juicy!

Great recipe!
Taste is amazing. 
I did shave off 30 minutes of cook time. As it would've been way over cooked! 
An hour is more than enough for legs and thighs usually. 
I thickened the sauce and used some on the sticky rice. 
Didn't think we would like it but we loved it!!

Very quick and easy. I used double the number of drumsticks, and still had a ton of sauce leftover -- will probably halve the butter/OJ/honey portion next time. My 9-year-old gave it an "A++" and my 2-year-old meat-averse son ate 4 drumsticks. We'll be making this again very soon.

This was a cool and fun to make recipe. I avoid added sugar so I reduced the honey by half, added extra orange zest, and used fresh rendered juice from three medium oranges instead of carton OJ.

The fun part was combing the orange/honey chicken sauce from the prepared chicken, with a side of  Udon noodles that I quickly stir-fried with 2 tbl spoons sesame oil, 1 tblspoon low sodium soy sauce, broccoli, carrot strings, chopped green onion, 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger, a small Serrano pepper. 

All said, the chicken was a little to organgy so I would not recommend the extra orange zest that I mentioned having added.  Good recipe though! I'll try it again for sure.

I made this for my husband so this short review below is what he told me and his opinion, as I'm a vegetarian. :)
This dish is perfect for people who has a sweet tooth, the rosemary mixes nicely with orange and honey. The sauce also makes the drumsticks nice and crispy.

Such a yummy combo!  I think it took me 75 min in cooking time.  Also, I halved the butter & honey- which was plenty.  I then added a little ginger and it was yummy!

This was very tasty and the whole family loved it. I used bone in chicken breasts, started them off for 30 minutes at 375 then did 30 minutes at 350. Agreed with others that 90 minutes of cooking time was excessive. Let the chicken rest under foil for 10 minutes while I added some cornstarch slurry to the pan to have a little thicker sauce.  Will definitely make again.

this was a great, flavourful recipe! I did not use any garlic (due to allergy), and lined the the bottom of the pan with the leftover oranges. turned out delish!

I won't be making this again. The orange and rosemary are both soooo strong that it is unbearable. My son didn't like it, I didn't like it, my husband said it is "okay" which is his polite way of saying "Please don't make me eat that again."

This was amazing despite the fact that my oven DIED  half way through cooking and I had to finish on the stove top.  I marinated the legs for over 24 hours - what fabulous flavour!  As I had them on the stove top I was able to thicken the marinade and make a sauce.  A huge hit with my 4 kids and the 3 x 19 year olds we had over for dinner.  Thank you for posting!

Another chicken recipe - yay!  Never enough of those.  This was very good.  Doesn't need to be cooked quite that long.  1 1/2 hours total is plenty and I used half thighs and half drumsticks.  Cut the butter to half what was called for and still alot of sauce, but good sauce.

The orange zest is the best!  I added a little extra. This recipe will satisfies my sweet soul and made my taste buds delight with delectable rewards after the effort.  I halved the recipe for two people.  I also followed suit like some other cooks and transferred most of the broth to a separate pan and added a little flour and cream.    Will make this again, no doubt about it.  Thanks Jolanta!

I made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was great. I also substituted the butter with extra virgin olive oil. I put all the ingredients, including fresh rosemary in a blender.  Marinated the chicken overnight and then baked it the next day for dinner.

I altered the recipe just a bit. Started out by browning the chicken legs (drum & thigh) in a skillet for about 5 minutes on each side. Transferred them to my slow cooker and poured the sauce over the chicken. Cooked on medium heat for 4 hours. Fall off the bone tender is an understatement!! Delicious!!

I made the marinade from this recipe for chicken k-bobs. I did add some Ponzu sauce to this. I cut chicken thighs into strips, marinated x 24 hours, then threaded onto the sticks. We grilled it for our 4th of July picnic. Fantastic flavor and a huge hit with everyone!

We made this for dinner for us and another couple removing all the skin from the chicken, cutting the honey by half (as recommended by others), cutting the butter by half, and using fresh Rosemary from our garden. Other than these changes, we followed the recipe and are looking forward to making it again.
Very yummy recipe and we recommend it to Allrecipes' "chefs".

I liked it but I think you definitely need to make rice to put all the extra sauce on. Sauce is pretty thin. Also it’s a good idea to broil it the last few minutes. It browns it quite nicely.

I loved this!  I have a lot of rosemary in my garden so this is a keeper.
Just wondering: has anyone tried grilling the chicken?. Btw, I use olive oil instead of butter.

We loved this! It was so easy! I made it in my roaster and it turned out so juicy and flavorful. I cut the oranges that I had used for zest into large slices and add them to the roaster as well. I will definitely make this again.

This is very good, especially the marinade. However, the cooking time is way off! A total of 90 minutes baking chicken parts at 350° and 325° produces dry chicken! Thank goodness for the delicious marinade when serving it! I will make it again and bake it, like I always bake chicken, until it is 160°, check it often for tenderness and then let it off heat. I halved the marinade recipe and there was more than enough. I also used boneless chicken breasts cut in half.

This was delicious! I only had one orange so used three Halos for the rest of the juice. I also used equal parts Mike's Hot Honey. This gave it a spicy kick. I didn't have legs so I used skin on, bone in thighs.  I put 3 carrots and 3 celery stalks cut up and a sliced onion in the bottom of a roasting pan then arranged the thighs on top. I poured the marinade over the top and started at 375° for 30 minutes then dropped to 325° for another 30 minutes. I basted the thighs at the halfway point. I removed the thighs and vegies to a platter and tented it with foil to rest. I defatted the remaining juice with a gravy separator (next time I'll only use half the butter and kept it first) before pouring into a saucepan to which I added a slurry of water and cornstarch, cooking to thicken. I served over white rice. We were so hungry smelling this cook that I forgot to take a picture.

I made this for my family following the recipe.  While it wasn't our favorite, we did like it, and I would make it again.  As others have stated, it makes plenty of juice to put over rice which can be thickened with cornstarch if desired.  It has a sweet, savory flavor which could be enhanced, as stated in another review, with some red pepper flakes.  To make it healthier, I'm going to try it with oil instead of butter and reduce the salt.

This was a very flavorful recipe...very citrus-y.  I really didn't change much at all.  I did use a combination of 4 boneless thighs and 4 chicken breast cutlets because of our personal preferences.   The only thing I would suggest is to use melted butter instead of room temperature butter with the marinade.  You can't whisk solid butter into orange juice and honey.  I also cut the liquid in half.  That  was more than enough.  In preheated 375 degree oven, I cooked chicken for 30 minutes then lowered temp to 350 for 10 minutes then shut off the oven until my rice and vegetable were done.   My husband liked it.

Just tried this recipe for the first time.   The instructions are clear, and while it is more work than I would usually want to do, the outcome is definitely worth it.  The chicken cooked thoroughly, and turned out tender and sweet.  I appreciate the clarity of the instructions in this recipe.

Loved it - takes a bit of time in the oven but it is well worth it.  The sauce is yummy and the finished legs live up to the fall-off-the-bone description.  Will definitely make this again.  For those that do not like dark meat, I do not see why this could not also be made with bone-in chicken breast...for me I'll stick with the legs

This was very good but it was way too much sauce for the amount of chicken.  It may have been important  but I'm not sure how the  butter helped the marinade, and I'm thinking next time I'll try using olive oil, halving the marinade and putting them flat in a glass pan overnight in the refrigerator, turning them once or twice.  Plain rice was a great choice with this, I can't think of any side that would compliment it more.   I use short grain sticky rice rather than the typical long grain and I think that helped.  Making it the day before was a big plus for me - that way while playing in the yard with my visiting grandson dinner was cooking away and all I had to do was baste it occasionally.  While I am not fond of chicken legs I really did enjoy this meal - and it was pretty to present which is always a plus with a family gathering.

followed recipe, came out great, description was perfect. Followed every direction, except I didn't really want to baste every 20 min, so I put it in one of those cooking bags, making sure the legs were all flat on the pan - turned out great!!
thought about trying the same recipe on a pork roast... we'll see!

We liked this well enough but my marinade didn't bake down and was too watery so the chicken (used bone in thighs) didn't brown.  I had to take the chicken out of the pan and broil them and added cornstarch to the marinade to thicken up then tossed the chicken in it to glaze.  If I made this again, I'll cut the marinade in half but this seemed like too much work at the end!

I used less honey but the next time I make it I will probably use half the quantity of honey as the chicken ended up tasting too sweet with the amounts given in the recipe.

I made this with olive oil instead of butter. I also pealed and sliced the orange after I removed the zest. I added the orange bits to the marinade. Otherwise I followed exactly. This turned out great. My guests loved it. I will make it again.

Modified slightly for use with pork loin chops. Instead of butter I added a few swirls of olive oil. No zest available, so skipped that. I added a shake or two of red pepper flakes. Marinated all day, then salted and grilled the chops for a few minutes on each side. Be careful, the honey will make them stick to the rack if not oiled first. Reduced the remaining marinade then added a pat of butter and thickened with cornstarch. Served chops with white rice, the thickened glaze and a tossed salad. Super quick and very yummy.

Really amazing flavor! There's a decent amount of prep. I used about half as much honey and substituted coconut oil for butter to make it healthier. I ended up heating the marinade to melt the coconut oil before adding it to the chicken. Will definitely make again!!!

My husband was skeptical when I told him what I was making for dinner. After his first bite he was sold! This recipe is awesome. The chicken turns out so tender and the orange and rosemary are a great combo. I definitely plan to make this again.

This was some darn good chicken. Very juicy.  I used fresh squeezed OJ.  The leftover sauce was thin, but it was still delicious over rice.  Next time I'll try reducing it to a thicker sauce.

I used chicken thighs, and soI did not turn heat down to325 as suggested. Good thing too. My guests loved the flavor of this dish. I think next time I will cut the OJ down to half a cup as the sauce did not boil down to make a crusty glaze that I would have liked.

I would make it again with less butter (not floating in it) and less orange - the orange flavor overpowered the dish.

Very good, used thighs instead of legs, and basil for rosemary as my wife has an allergy to rosemary. It was very good. Marinated 24 hrs. and baked 1 & 1/4 hrs. Will make again soon.

I used skinless chicken and it turned out tender and juicy.  The sauce was not overly sweet but that could be because I had not realized that I had run out of honey and used corn syrup instead.  Still it is a make again

I used chicken breasts since I had them on hand and this recipe turned out very good. Chicken was juicy and if I had some oranges for zest & put them in, it probably would have had more orange flavor. I had pulpy orange juice and that worked fine.  I would definitely make these again.

Substituted Chicken Quarters in place of drumsticks. The butter didn't work as well for the marinade and liquid - I'm going to try olive oil next time.

Way too much honey and butter.  It would be a lot healthier, and taste just as good, with 1/4 cup honey and 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (blood orange infused olive oil, if you can find it) instead of butter.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly - fewer chicken pieces, different marinade, cooked with the orange in the pan - but this was a big hit in my house. I served it with a fresh green bean and mushroom medley.
