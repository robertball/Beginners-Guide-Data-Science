Tasty! I used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger and used a jalapeno pepper instead of habanero. The 1/2 cup of oil is a little much, so I reduced it to 1/4 cup. The recipe makes alot of marinade for 12 wings, so I doubled the amount of wings. Lastly, I baked mine at 375 for 20-25 mins without basting. Turned on the broiler to crisp it up for a few mins and perfection!

The flavor of this is delicious! I used it on pieces of chicken breast instead of wings, and I couldn't go out to grill so I baked them in the oven in the marinade (@ 375 for about 25 minutes). I've never cooked with habaneros before, so I didn't know how hot this was going to be, but it was a perfect level of spiciness for me - a good moderate amount of heat. I will definitely keep making this. Thanks, BencyCooks!

This is by far my favorite wing recipe. So good. Perfect amount of heat. My bf who loves traditional buffalo wings couldn't decide which he liked better. I will be making these often. Next time I'm going to try chicken breats like the other reviewer. Amazing! Can't get enough!

Wonderful! I really enjoyed the blend of spices in the dish. Nothing was overpowering. I admit I did not include the habanero pepper to make it more tolerable for those that couldn't handle the heat, but I'm looking forward to making this spicier next time. Thanks!

Brought these to a bbq last night and everybody loved them. I marinated them for more like 24 hours and didn't have a habanero so I added some habanero hot sauce. Instead of whisking the oil into the juice and seasonings I just dumped it all into a big mason jar and gave it a good shake, much easier. The wings were delicious and I will definately be using this marinade again and again.

They were very good, but not authentic jerk flavor.  If you want real jerk flavor, get an authentic Jerk recipe or order Walkerswood Jerk Marinade.  I've used it for years.  It is fabulous!

We made these for New Years to go with our Caribbean themed meal.  They turned out okay.  Not too spicy.  More like a very seasoned chicken wing.  We also baked them in the oven due to the extreme temperatures in WI this time of year.  I thought the wings would be dry in the oven, but the marinade bakes off and they were perfected moist with a slightly crisp skin.  The sauce left in the pan went WONDERFULLY with the cilantro lime rice from this website.  To get more of a kick, i may add a little more jalepeno next time (i must admit that we only used 2 jalepeno peppers without the seeds due to us have small kids around).  Overall, very tasty.

I have never tasted anything like this before! It was very interesting and fresh. I used chopped jalapeno instead of a habanero pepper but otherwise added all ingredients as listed. We marinaded for 2 days (not on purpose) and then deep fried. These wings were delicious!!!

I have made this recipe a few times now and my husband and I love it.  I do not generally have allspice or nutmeg (I don't care for it) so those two ingredients were omitted.  Also, I didn't want it to be too spicy so I left out the habanero pepper.  Having said that, I don't think the alterations greatly affect the integrity of the recipe (I don't like it when people rate recipes based on a bunch of changes that they have made - ratings should be based on the recipe as written, or as close to it as possible).  At some point I will likely buy allspice and nutmeg so I can see what difference they make to the recipe.  Right now though, we love this recipe without those ingredients - and when we can prepare food for those who can handle some spice, we will definitely make it with the peppers.  Very tasty recipe for chicken!

This is amazing!!! I used a jalape√±o pepper instead of a habanero pepper, but it was still delicious. Not too spicy, but I like my jerk chicken just a little tangy.

this came out beyond wonderful.. i used dried thyme and only 1/8 tsp b/c i'm not a fan.. halved the oil like someone else suggested.. used 8 drumsticks instead of the wings.. cooked on a charcoal grill.. i almost never care for skin and i had no problem enjoying it.. we finished  every single drumstick just amongst the two of us.. that's how awesome it was.. we had this with some sauteed kale and jamaican "rice and peas" recipe from another site.. ty for the recipe =) ~~UPDATE: this was awesome yet again.. i used this for three 8 oz boneless pork chops.. i halved the black pepper and doubled the habanero pepper.. it wasn't super spicy but i did de-seed de-vein the peppers.. it was just super flavorful.. this will be my go-to jerk recipe.. ty again ~~UPDATE #2: such a great recipe! this time we used the marinade on 16/20 count shrimp with the shells on.. used one habanero and left the seeds/vein in.. it's totally the way to go.. grilled on our Island Grill Stone with the marinade included.. ty again and again

This marinade is one of my summer favourites.  I begged my friend to send me the link to the recipe when they first made it for our cottage trip. I made small adjustments:
1) I reduced to 1/4 cup oil
2) I used 1/2 cup of orange juice
3) I used 3 scotch bonnet peppers (1 seeded and 2 with seeds)
4) I did not use allspice because I did not have any.
The peppers give it a nice kick!

Outstanding flavor! I made using 1 1/2 habeneros and marinated wings for 4 hours.  This will be a staple this summer! Enjoy!
