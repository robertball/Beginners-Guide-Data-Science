These were okay, but not really worth the effort. I made the marinade and marinated them overnight, and they still didn't have very much flavor.

very good and simple recipe.  i don't know if i should be posting my rating here since we were out of Taragon and had to replace that ingredient with Balsamic Vinagrette but it did real well considering and my veggie friends all loved these skewered items.

I did not drain the veggies and did not grill them for long but they were still delicious.

Love this marinade! My husband usually doesn't eat veggies, but he loved this recipe.
