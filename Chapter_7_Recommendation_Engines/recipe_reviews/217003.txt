We love Chicken Marsala and anything with mushrooms...this was a very yummy creamy version. I followed the recipe except I substituted the Mascarpone cheese with Philadelphia Cooking Creme (Italian flavor). VERY flavorful dish and will make again when we have company for dinner.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I just had to say how AWESOME this recipe is.  I made it last night for a friend and we loved it!  She said it was better than a restaurant.  I did not buy the mushrooms listed, I used 8 oz. of button mushrooms and 8 oz. of baby bellas and it was yummy.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

My family just ate this and they love it. My dad who doesn't like "Italian food" other then spaghetti really enjoyed the meal.  I did deviate a bit and I used the Philadelphia cook creme Italian as suggested by one of the posters. Definitely will be made again!

this was good.  it seemed like it was missing something though, maybe salt?  it also did not have that nice wine-y marsala-y taste.  maybe it needed more or maybe it was my wine i don't know.  anyway my bf really liked it.

I thought this was EXCELLENT!!  I think I would increase the sauce for next time.  The sauce was sufficient but it was sooo good I wanted more for the pasta.  Next time, I would also take care to LIGHTLY coat the chicken with the flour mixture making sure to shake of excess.  The coating on mine was a little too thick but the dish still tasted great.  My friend and I used to love going to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch and would order chicken marsala. I feel accomplished being able to make it on my own just as good!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Delicious.  My sister and I enjoyed the meal on Easter Sunday.  I used button mushrooms and heavy cream instead of cheese because they were the ingredients I had in my "fridge".  But the meal was still excellent.  I've been trying to finding a Chicken Marsala recipe.  This was my third try and by far the best.

Followed recipe except for:  added 1/2 tsp garlic powder & basil to flour.  I trippled the sauce using only 2 TBS of dijon & used heavy cream.  Also doubled onions and used only button mushrooms.  To thicken sauce after I added the chicken back into it, I mixed a TBS of cornstarch w/ 1 Cup chicken broth (swansons).  Perfect!  Don't forget fresh shaved or shredded parmesan on top, yummm!!!!

Even though I rarely make recipes with so many ingredients, so many cooking instructions --- and so many calories (!), I decided to throw caution to the winds and prepare this dish for my husband for Valentine's Day.  It was s-o-o-o delicious and he enjoyed it completely.  It's two days later and he is still raving about it --- and he can't wait until we eat the remaining two cutlets!

The only changes I made to the recipe (and I don't think they affected the final dish at all) was I used a whole grain cappellini (Barilla Plus) instead of the fettucine.  It's a lot lighter and less filling.  And I used 1-10oz. box each of thickly sliced baby bella mushrooms and regular mushrooms.

Incidentally, I found the preparation time was a LOT longer than 30 minutes but that just may be because I am not accustomed to preparing gourmet dishes!  But this dish (even though I may never make it again) was worth all the time and effort that went into cooking it!  Absolutely delicious!

I am making it now. It smells so yummy! I am using roasted garlic instead of regular garlic. I roast 15 heads of garlic all at once and then once mushed I place it in a ice cube tray. So I am using two cubes of roasted garlic.

Wow! This recipe tastes great! My chicken breasts were very large so I had to cook them in 3 batches. Too much chicken for the recipe. If very large, use 2. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. I didn't measure it but used a generous teaspoon. Don't leave out the Dijon. It only calls for 2 tablespoons but it gives the recipe just the zing it needs! Really really really good.

My husband and I made this on valentines day.  We cook a lot and this is one of best dishes we have ever made.  We will be making it again.  I added 2 cups of broth instead of 1, only 2 cups of shrooms, and about a cup of heavy whipping cream.  Next time I will add a little more onion, shrooms, and Marsala wine.   
Still one of the best dishes ever!!!!!!

I work for a very well known Italian restaurant, and this put their chicken marsala to shame. I did double the wine (cause I love the flavor) and used heavy cream instead of mascarpone (I couldn't find it). Even my 6 yr old loved it and willingly ate mushrooms for the first time. Next time I will double the sauce...we were scraping the bottom of the pan to cover our pasta.

Great taste. I could not find the cheese so I used whipped cream cheese. Just not to much, about 6oz. and you do have to blend it in well.   The mushrooms flavor comes out just right.  I keep savoring the taste.  MMMMM.

Honestly, the BEST pasta I’ve ever had. The recipe sounds cumbersome, but it’s really not. The only thing I changed was substituting cream cheese for the mascarpone. I suggest doubling or even tripling the sauce. It’s THAT GOOD. Ok, I’m off to have another serving.....

Made with 6 oz cream cheese and 2-3 tbsp. milk instead of mascarpone. 
Used 2 large chicken breasts, each cut in half to make 4 pieces, then pounded thin. Yum!

Very Very good. The 12oz of fettucine is toooo much for the amount of sauce. I started to use 8oz next time I will.  Phenomenal.

Used more mushrooms (2x) what they called for. Besides that it's great and has an excellent flavor. Will do again for sure!!

Everyone thought the dish was delicious! When i sautéed the mushrooms,  I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth because i used some dried oyster mushrooms with the cemini  mushrooms, and they plumped up and the extra broth gave us additional sauce.  I added half and half and a tablespoon of sour cream instead of the mascarpone cheese, and some extra chicken broth at the end to stretch the sauce, and let it reduce a bit. The chicken was tender and delicious, and the sauce was great!
I would recommend!

This was pretty good but next time I would pair with basmati rice instead of the heavy noodles.
