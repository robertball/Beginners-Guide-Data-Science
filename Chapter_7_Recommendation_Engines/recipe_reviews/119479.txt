Great way to use up garden tomatoes that are going off.  I did need to add lots of garlic since I only had mild sausage.    Wonderful  on a snowy day!!!

Very good!!  Even my picky husband raved about it.  I didn't have any picante sauce on hand, so I added pureed salsa instead.  We will definitely be making this again!

Fabulous! My family ate the whole pot! I modified by leaving out the green pepper, doubling the beef broth and hot sausage, adding one tsp crushed red pepper flakes, then adding ditalini at the end.  Quick, easy & tastee!

This was a fabulously spicy dish.  I made it for a dinner party as a starter, and everyone wanted more of this instead of the main course!  Make sure to use HOT Italian sausage (not sweet or mild) to get the full flavor.  And definitely add the pepper flakes.

Fabulous soup and easy to make! I used 1 lb of "Hot" Italian Sausage and "Fire Roasted" diced tomatoes. It came out great;  very tasty and spicy.

I only added a 14 oz can of tomatoes and thought it was plenty.  At the very end I put in some very thin small spaghetti.  My son thought it tasted like Spaghetti-Os.  The sausage gave it a good flavor.  Will make it again.

It was really good. I used maple sausage and didn't use the picante sauce or the green pepper. It made for a milder version of the soup and was very tasty.

I have a recipe similar to this one and love it- I have found it is tastier when using stewed tomatoes instead of just plain canned ones.  They have more taste.

Delicious soup! I didn't have any picante sauce or a green pepper, so I added a can of rotel to the pot. I used sweet italian sausage, and I did as others suggested, cooking a clove of chopped garlic with the sausage and onion.

I just made this soup (double batch) for my annual Holiday Soup Open House and could not have been more pleased.  Everyone raved and several copies of the recipe had to be printed pronto.  Thanks for the perfect Tomato based soup recipe.

This was a fabulous soup.  I added some chicken and replaced the picante with a medium salsa.

Loved it.

This recipe won me the coveted "Soup Queen" award at our campground this year. I used spicy Italian chicken sausage and medium picante sauce and everyone came back for more. Loved it!

A really good and hearty soup for a chilly Fall day.  I added a fresh jalapeno and some minced garlic to kick the spice factor up a notch.  Served with warm cornbread and my five kids and their friends were raving.  I can't wait to try it again to maybe add some lentils.

Delicious and sooo easy!!! I did double the sausage to 1 lb. Added mini farfalle after it simmered then turned off the soup to let it cook on its own. Delicious. There was virtually no grease from my sausage so trying in crock pot now. May add some kernel corn too.

We liked this soup, with a few additions. I used hot turkey sausage, added a can of garbanzo beans and some small elbow pasta (not quite half of a box) at the very end of the cooking time. As for spices, I added garlic to the green pepper, onion and sausage as it sauteed. I also added Italian seasoning and onion powder to the soup as it simmered. I simmered it for almost an hour to enhance the flavor. Very filling soup, will make again!

I'm cooking as I type and I just gave it taste and it is soooo good!  I didn't use the beef broth or any broth, but I did use garlic diced tomatoes, a can of tomato soup, Thai chili peppers and 1 lb. spicy pork sausage.  It's not a great soup until you add the sugar and the basil!  I also seasoned my sausage.  This soup certainly hits the spot.

The family loved this!! When peppers are plentiful in the summer, I coarse chop them and keep them  in the freezer. They were perfect for this recipe. I used turkey sausage as that's what I had on hand. Wonderful to eat on a cold winter's night!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and really like it.  I added pepper to each serving to give it a little more kick.  Thank you for a change from the norm.

we really enjoyed this.  I used the hot Italian sausage (recommend) and  I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced because I knew my husband wouldn't eat it if he saw chunks of tomatoes in his soup, and I used salsa instead of picante sauce because that is what I had on hand.   I added salt, pepper and 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder.    I wouldn't leave anything out of this recipe because all of the ingredients come together to create a great final dish with lots of flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe  : )

This recipe is easy and so good!!!! Used salsa instead of picante because it was in the fridge and a little extra sausage. Perfect for a winter night!
