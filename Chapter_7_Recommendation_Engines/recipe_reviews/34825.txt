This is my wife's favorite casserole dish. I lost the original recipe from   the side of a rotini box. I have looked for this recipe for a while and am very glad to find it. This is a meal we will have every couple of weeks in the winter. Easy, good, and it is readily able to be changed to meet individual's tastes and needs. Thanks.

MMMM! This is my kind of comfort food. It is a little bland, so definitely season it to your tastes. I sauteed a clove of garlic with the chicken, which added good flavor, and threw in a good dose of black pepper. I think the proportions are a bit off. I halved the amount of chicken and pasta, leaving everything else the same. Even then, the sauce was a bit sparse. I imagine that would need to nearly triple the soup and milk if you were making the entire recipe. This is a huge recipe, even with halving it, it filled my biggest casserole dish. Anyway, I thought this was quite tasty and would definitely make again.

We weren't impressed with this recipe at all.  It is very bland, and incredibly dry.  It requires much more milk than the recipe calls for, and it is definitely not cheesy enough.  Luckily, I put some crushed croutons on top before I baked it, or there would have been no flavor at all.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

My family of 5 VERY picky eaters all loved this one! I read the reveiws beforehand and made some changes and it worked out great!!! I added less peas (next time I'll just make a vegetable on the side), doubled the amount of milk, added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt while browning, and added extra cheese. It wasn't dry or bland. It does make a lot so I put some in a small casserole dish to share with a friend!!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added a cup of chicken broth to the recipe.  I also topped with bread crumbs instead of additional cheese.  It wasn't dry, but still turned out pretty bland, and as someone else pointed out, was simply too labor intensive given the outcome.  3 stars because of the modifications necessary. If I make it again, I will use seasoning  while browning the chicken.

First of all, this recipe makes a ton! We had leftovers for quite some time, which is always nice :) Less cooking for me! Next time I would add more chicken...my boyfriend loves to have plenty of meat with his meals and I ended up having to add a few extra chicken breasts when we heated up the leftovers. Also, i would recommend adding some seasoning to your chicken. I added some italian seasoning the 2nd time around and it was great. We will add it to our rotation. Overall, good and easy.

I loved it, maybe next time I will use less noodles and more cheese.  Better known as a "fancy" Mac and Cheese Casserole and since my hubby doesn't really like mac and cheese, surprisingly he really enjoyed this meal.

Pretty good - needed something for more flavor - will saute chicken breasts with seasoning salt next time.  Might be good with bread crumb topping instead of the additional cheese.

I agree with the other reviews that state this recipe is too dry.  Also, unless you REALLY, REALLY like peas, cut the amount by at least half.

This was great with a few changes and additions. Had heard it was a bit dry and without taste. I marinated my chicken with seasonings and italian dressing. Used 1 can of cheddar soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 2/3 cup milk, 1 can chicken broth. I also used one full bag of cheddar with monterey jack cheese. Topped with bread crumbs. There was plenty of sauce and plenty of taste. It made a significant amount. I would say this would easily serve 6-8 "hearty" eaters.

This was great, but it does make a TON and I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup and another 1/3 cup of milk to make it a bit saucier.  Yummy!

!~The serving size on this is WAY of~!  This is enough to feed an army. I will have left overs for days. It was good but would half the recipe next time. Would also add more cheese but I like extra cheese on everything. Will make it again but not for a while since I am already tired of looking at the left overs.

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover roasted chicken and thought this would be good with a few changes.  First, I read the reviews about it being too dry, so I added a cup of chicken broth. Also, since my husband isn't a big cheese fan, I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cheese soup and left out the mushrooms.
I also heated this in the microwave so the sauce wouldn't dry out (my family likes saucy casseroles).  I was pleased with the casserole, my family liked it, and I will make this again.  I may use broccoli instead of peas the next time.

This recipe is bland.  I added a few things.  I fried up three strips of bacon and let them cool and chopped them up, then when you saute your onions I added a few teaspoons of minced garlic.  It ended up baking a little dry so I would recomend adding more milk so it turns our more creamy.

This was so easy to do (I was catering a film set, so a casserole was a must)! I used turkey instead of chicken and precooked/cut instead of raw.  I also used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for...everyone loved it! I will have to make this sans the poultry and use more veggies (like corn and carrots) for myself. :)

This recipe is very easy and my husband and daughter loved it!  I added a bit more milk, a cup of sour creme and extra cheddar cheese.  I also used season salt on the chicken when I was cooking it.  Next time I think I am going to try it with some creme cheese.  Very yummy recipe!

Really good easy casserole.  I added a can of cream of mushroom like one reviewer suggested.  I doubled the milk since I added the extra can of soup.  I also didn't have peas and added corn instead.  My family said this is a keeper.

Wonderful with what ever kind of frozen veggies you have in the fridge, I just added a little more cheese then suggested, the more cheese the merrier!

Everyone loved it.  Very easy to prepare.  Would have been great even without the chicken.

I added more milk based on previous reviews...still needs more liquid! Added pepper, celery flakes, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and a dash of salt to the chicken while it was cooking. I added crushed croutons to the top before baking. Turned out pretty good. I'll add maybe two cups of milk and possibly some chicken broth next time.

I made one small pan using mushrooms and one small pan using a pre-cooked deli bar chicken, due to dietary preferences in my family. I used shredded "Cracker Barrel habernero heat" cheddar cheese and a few shakes of garlic powder to give it more flavour. It was really good, quick and simple.

This is a really good recipe. But I do agree with most reviews, it does need more seasoning. I added minced garlic and seasoning salt to the seasoning of my chicken and I added cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic to my mix. Definitely will make again with more seasoning and I think bacon pieces maybe good too.

My kids really liked this chicken dish.  And they usually don’t like casseroles that much.  So I will make this again for the family. I had a lot of rotisserie chicken and I had rotini pasta so I found this recipe.  I read a lot of the reviews and adjusted the recipe.  I used only 12 ounces of rotini pasta.  I sautéed 1 large onion with 5 garlic cloves and 5 oz of sliced fresh mushrooms. Then since my chicken was cooked, I added it at the end of sauteing for just of a minute.  I only used 7 ounces of frozen peas.  I used 1 whole cup of milk. Besides the 1 can of Cheddar Cheese soup, I also added 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  I did not add more salt or pepper. It came out just right for us! We like sauce.

Just made this, sounded right up my boyfriends alley... Good, but DEFINITELY bland... And i have a whole boat-load of it left over, ha. I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over my bowl for a quick-fix... Next time I'll use more milk, different sprinkley cheeses, and season my chicken... I would've been disappointed if I made this giagantor dish and brought it to an event or get-together. Because of its bland-ness. Boyfriend likes it though.

This was really good!  I had a few variations of my own.  I cooked the chicken, 1 green onion, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 c.. frozen peas, 1 c. fresh sliced mushrooms and 1 sprig of fresh rosemary in olive oil until the chicken was done.  I added my own measurements to taste of salt, pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning and seasoned salt while cooking. I combined 2/3 of a family size can of cream of mushroom soup with  1 1/2 cups of milk.  I stirred in one cup of fiesta shredded cheese and added this to the chicken mixture. I cooked 2/3 of the amount of rotini called for because of some of the previous reviews of how this recipe made a lot, but did not have enough sauce.  I sprayed a 13.x9" pan with oil and poured my drained pasta in the bottom.  I then poured the chicken sauce over it all, careful to make sure that all the pasta was covered in sauce. and topped with remaining cup of shredded cheese.  Baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was Perfect!  Next time I might add fresh brocolli when I cook the chicken to fully round it all out.  Thanks for sharing!  My family loved it!
