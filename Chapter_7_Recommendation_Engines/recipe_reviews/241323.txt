This was OK to me in flavor--really messy to eat. I added some hamburger seasoning to the ground beef and am glad I did, because it would have been lacking in flavor otherwise. This recipe was fun to try.

These were very good, a little messy, but good!  Will be having again.  I used left over Queso sauce from our Super Bowl party.  I ate mine open-faced.  Very good and very easy.
