Great recipe! I made this recipe before and they were crumbly.  I realized that the 2 minute boiling rule was very important! I made them two days ago and they turned out awesome! I agree with the other review in that they were grainy and sweet from the sugar.  Today I made them but added only 1.5 cups of sugar and they were PERFECT!  I also added the cocoa to the boiled mixture after it was done.

So easy to make and so fabulous. I followed directions exactly. I was surprised at how easy it was to create the texture needed to pass these off as great cookies. I love that they are chocolate goodness and I especially appreciate the fact that they are no bake cookies WITHOUT any peanut butter.

A little soft and sticky.  Instead of using 1 cup coconut and 3 cups oats I used 2 cups of each.  I think next time I would use 3 cups coconut and 2 cups oats.  Otherwise, very tasty.

This is a great recipe.  I had to make some substitutions to make this dairy and soy free, and these cookies still turned out great.  I can't stop eating them!  I cut the sugar to just under 2 cups, used coconut milk in place of fat-free milk and dairy-free, soy-free spread in place of the butter.  I will definitely make these again!

My Mom made these when I was growing up and I just loved them:)  I followed another reviewers advice and use only 1.5 cups of sugar, 2 1/2 cups coconut and 2 cups of oats.  Boil for 2 mins and they come out perfect!  I also find that whisking the cocoa into the milk mixture initially helps the process along:)

This is a favorite in my family, I usually make a double batch to avoid fighting over them. I use 1 full stick of butter and 1/4 c. of cocoa. We also leave out the coconut usually but they're great either way!

Just a few tips:  Add the cocoa powder to the first mixture.  It blends in better.  Boil only 1 minute.  After removing from heat, add the vanilla first.  If desired, add 1/2 c. chopped walnuts to take these cookies over the top!  This is one of the first recipes I made by myself; and the cookies are a family favorite!

They're Great! I made them as a treat and everyone loved them. They weren't too grainy or too sweet. I think people that say they are too grainy may not be boiling the sugar mixture as long as needed. Start the two minutes once it comes to a boil, no earlier. I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and it was awesome! Great recipe!

This type of recipe goes back to atleast my grandpa's mom.  An all-time family favorite. We don't use coconut, but sometimes add peanut butter (this helps thicken them up too) or my favorite, raisins.  So naughty and yummy!

I recieved them from a cookie swap, along with this recipe. They were way too sweet, gritty and had no chocolate flavor.

My husband likes these a lot as a pb-free broken oven cookie!  I use 1.5 C. of sugar rather than 2 cups.  It's still amply sweet.

Very good.  Very much like I remember from my childhood.  I was out of eggs and wanted cookies : ).  I was also almost out of butter so I used half a sick of butter and four tablespoons of shortening.  Strange, I know, but they still taste great.

These were just like the cookies my grandmother and aunts used to make growing up. They were not grainy or too dry.  If you have your ingredients pre-measured and the wax paper ready these work well. They are so good, I am having trouble keeping everyone from eating them all right away!

These were good, but I messed up by using some "substitute" sugar! It needs to cook longer because it didn't set up like it did when I remade them using regular sugar. I won't make that mistake again.

For those of you who have experienced a 'graininess' to the cookies, I've found that adding about 1 T of light corn syrup to the sugar/milk/cocoa/butter mixture when it is boiling eliminates this and give the cookies a beautiful chocolatey gloss.  To increase the fiber in the cookies I tried adding a cup of lightly crushed bran flakes in place of one of the cups of oats and you couldn't tell the difference!  I agree with other cooks who reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups---that is plenty of sweetness with the sweetened coconut.  Hope my tips help someone!

I made these cookies last night 'cause I was craving something chocolate, and all I had was cocoa powder. I only added 1.5 cups of sugar, and didnt' have any coconut so left that out. The cookies this morning tasted great, I also added the cocoa to the milk/butter/sugar to boil... However they are quite soft and sticky, and I've always had them harder and crunchier.

These are fine. I like the traditional ones with peanut butter better. I would like to try a no bake with peanut butter, coconut, and marshmallows at some point :o). I never have milk, but have found you can swap the milk/sugar for a can of fat free sweetened condensed milk in no bake recipes. The tasted is best if you boil the cocoa with it.  Slightly softer, but still good.

So yummy!! We have always made no-bake cookies without the peanut butter because my mom doesn't like peanut butter and chocolate together. But I've never had them with coconut. What a great addition! I didn't change a thing and they turned out great!

I haven't tried this yet but have to rate at 5-star b/c it doesn't contain PB like other no back chocolate cookie recipes.  We have a peanut allergy with our two year old and my husband loves no bakes!  Thanks!

These cookies are really great.  I've been looking for a recipe that tastes like the "frog cookies" that my mom used to make because she can't remember how to make them anymore.  These are the closest to what I remember out of all the recipes I've tried.  I still can't find one that isn't as moist and chewy though.  I tried the recipe twice and they came the closest to what I remember in the second batch when I omitted the vanilla (WAY to sweet with it) and used unsweetened flaked coconut. (WAY too sweet with that as well). I also boiled it for 1 min instead of 2 after it started a hard boil and that made them not so gooey.  Excellent!

I added 3/4 cup chopped sweetened dried cranberries. I also added another 2T cocoa for a total of 1/2c because I thought the cranberries might make them too sweet. Very easy to make and rather addictive. Thanks for the post Carol.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were easy to make and delicious!  I like to mix the dry ingredients separately and add them all at once, but I doubt it makes a difference.

A little thicker than I like, but I'll just cut down on the oats next time.

good cookies. i listened to the other reviews and added 1.5 cups of oats and 2.5 coconut....if you really like coconut its good but i would do it the other way around, too much coconut for me but they set nice.

A little gooey, but easy and delicious. Substituted 1tsp of coconut extract for the coconut flakes. Turned out great.

wow... these are SWEET.  they almost taste like fudge... coconut fudge that is.  i followed the recipe exactly.  you have to work REALLY fast to spoon them out otherwise the last half of the batch ends up too crumbly to stick together.  i tried adding a little bit of milk but i don't think that was very successful as the last of the cookies look wet and like they aren't going to set up.  oops.  if really sweet, chocolate coconut cookies are your thing then i say try this recipe.  if not, skip it. :P

I used sweetened coconut so then only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar and the flavor turned out amazing! I also found that I have to store them in the freezer or they will easily fall apart. But not to worry, they are still nice and chewy when "frozen"! Delicious! :D

All in all, these are super yummy cookies. But I had to alter this recipe as there wasn't enough liquid and it was hardening before I could even get them spooned out.  If you find this happens to you, just add a bit of warmed milk slowly until it's the right consistency. You want them to be sticky, not runny!

We were searching for a reciepe for No Bake Cookies, that had no peanut butter to send to school because of peanut allergies. This receipe filled the bill.  Upon reading reviews, I ran across the ones that said these were grainy. I wonder if they used cane sugar. Beet sugar tastes the same as cane, but if you try to make candy or cookies such as these, the sugar doesn't completely desolve and the cookies will come out grainy. Because of the cooking problem with beet sugar, I learned years ago to only buy cane sugar.

Tasted great and I just wanted to keep eating them.  They did not solidify completely even though I followed the directions and even let them boil for a minute.  I did cut down the sugar a bit.  Either way, will make again.

So these cookies are pretty much amazing. I looked all over for this recipe because I didn't know what they were called. I also cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups the second time I made them and increased coconut to 2 1/2 cups and the oats to 2 cups.

Very sugary, and a little grainy even after 2 minutes of boiling the mixture. The coconut is a nice touch, but this recipe is far from perfected.

Yum!  I didn't have any coconut & only 1/2 the sugar, so just cut the recipe down.  They were so good though, I went out and got the ingredients to make them again already!
