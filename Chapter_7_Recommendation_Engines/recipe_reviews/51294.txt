I will admit that I was a bot skeptical when I read this recipe.  The words hot sauce and pineapple just didn't seem like they should work.  I added more honey that called for and substitued a Thai Sweet Red Pepper Chili sauce instead of the hot sauce.  It made a really nice addition.  I also added more honey than the recipe called for.  After marinading t for about an hour these turned out to be the most amazing twist on pineapple that I have ever had.  This made a great fruit even better.  This will become a staple for me at grillouts

I rated this 4 stars because I tried some of the pineapple while I was grilling, delicious!  I do not mean to be rude but the idea for putting on vanilla ice cream really ruined it...at least for me.  Please try it BEFORE you serve it to everyone that way.  Personally, I think I would have been much better off serving it as is..it is REALLY delicious that way.  I know though, in the end, we all have different taste buds.  But I do urge folks to try it with ice cream before making that your dish, you may thank me.

Canned pineapple works too! I just patted two cans of sliced pineapple (in juice, not syrup) dry before putting them in a ziploc with the marinade (I skipped the butter and used sriracha as my hot sauce, adding a little extra) and loved the spicy zip the sriracha brought to the party.  Absolutely amazing with teriyaki marinated pork chops!

Fresh pineapple is great on it's own, but grill it and you really have a wonderful treat. I couldn't bring myself to add hot pepper sauce or salt, so I added a little bit of cinnamon and brown sugar instead. I also didn't have time to marinate this overnight and it was still really good. I served this with some toasted coconut and vanilla ice cream - YUM!

Very simple and very good! We doubled the butter and hot sauce. Everyone at the barbeque raved about the flavor. We debated on 1/2-inch or 1-inch slices. After grilling, we realized that the 1-inch slices retained the juicy flavor more. Next time we will have to triple the recipe since the plate was empty in two minutes flat.

I love this. I slice the pineapple lengthwise in ~1 inch pieces so thatI can skip skewers. I also substitute cayenne for hot pepper sauce. Finally, I use both the meat and the core - different textures, but both tasty.

Oh my, what a treat. I didn't use the hot pepper sauce or salt and didn't miss either.  Served this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and shredded fresh coconut.  (I think a little rum caramel sauce would be awesome!)

Beyond AWESOME! Okay so I found the addition of the hot sauce kind of strange but this really heightened the sweetness of the pineapple. This received un-ending raves at our family reunion picnic. The recipe has been passed on no doubt to all of our family.  5 stars are really not good enough for this recipe.  Note for one batch we did add cinnamon sugar adn brown sugar to carmelize them on the grill. THis was even better. I think next time we will try soaking them in rum for the adults and see how that comes out. YUM!! :-)

I'm torn as to how I feel about this.  I wanted to love it, but I don't think I do.  I keep tasting another bite and trying to taste anything but warm pineapple, yet I don't.  I followed the recipe (I even measured!), but I'm not getting anything other than warm pineapple?  Mr. LTH rated it a "2, no 3" and I'm giving it a 3.5-4, so we'll round up and go w/"4".  I'm going to experiment and grill an un-marinated slice of pineapple and see if there's a discernible difference to me.  TY for the recipe!

The hot sauce I used was Cholula chipotle.  It was fantastic.  Sweet and spicy is an all time favorite of mine.  If you want more of a smoky flavor, substitute smoked salt for regular in the marinade.

This sauce was good but grilled pineapple is so good on it's own I don't feel like this sauce did that much for it besides adding fat and calories.

This simple recipe is a real crowd pleaser!  These buttery pineapple rings melt in your mouth.  I put a little extra hot pepper sauce by mistake and it was the best mistake I've made!!

These were an all-around favorite. We added a bit more hot sauce. We let half marinate for 30 minutes and the other half marinate over night. No real difference. Very yummy.

Sorry. I didn't like this recipe at all. My pineapple was super juicy and sweet prior to making the recipe. When placed on the grill, it flared up fast and nearly burnt. After tasting it. We all agreed, it sort of had a weird taste and wasn't good. The grill marks didn't add but burnt flavor.

Refrigerated 6hrs.  Right away, I noticed the honey butter congealed, sticking mostly to the bag.  When I removed the pineapple to grill, most of the sauce stayed in the bag.  Very disappointing.  I'd recommend laying the slices on a plate and brushing on the sauce, then either put them in the fridge or leave them on the counter for 30 min or so.  I served the slices with vanilla ice cream.  An OK combination, but maybe sherbet would work better?

This was good, but I really couldn't taste any of the marinade. I only had 3 hours for it to marinate, but I was hoping to taste more flavors. I'll try it again, increasing the hot sauce and letting it sit overnight for sure.

Excellent! I added a splash of whiskey to the marinade as well so they'd be flambéed with some fire marks. good with fish/meat or a dab of (lowfat?) whipped cream. Mmmm, thumbsup.

Yum... I'm a nut about the honey-butter combo - so this was easily a winner for me. I will have to try again when I can marinate overnight AND grill on an outdoor grill. (Unfortunately, no grilling on my condo balcony. Tears!) BUT I did use my stainless grill pan and it worked just fine and had the pretty grill marks. I skipped the hot pepper sauce...just didn't feel like adding it. :)

For the marinade, I replaced the hot sauce with cayenne pepper. I used chunked pineapple from a can because it was all I had at the time. I was only able to marinade for about 45 mins, then placed chunks on skewers and grilled on each side for 3-4 mins. It was a GREAT side dish to grilled chipotle marinaded pork loin. I will definately be making this dish again, maybe next time with fresh pineapple.

Different & easy way to fix grilled pineapple. I've made it twice and the 2nd time I halved the butter, but doubled the honey and hot sauce (sriracha - Thai chili). Even better this way. I served it with grilled chicken both times, but I can see it as a simple dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I thought these were excellent but then I love anything with some heat. Lol. We grilled these on a camping trip several months ago and I'm just getting around to rating them. A unique twist but I thought the hot sauce gave these just the right amount of punch. Not too hot...just right. We just had them for a simple dessert, but I think they would also be great with pork or chicken. Perhaps on a grilled chicken sandwich?

I made this for my boyfriend who is the better cook and generally does most of the cooking. He couldn't stop raving about it. Made it with another recipe I found here for "tropical grilled pork chops" that went really well together. Just hope it doesn't lead to greater expectations, I like being spoiled by his cooking! LOL

Tried this today ... while this is the first time I've grilled fresh pineapple, I don't see that the butter or hot sauce added a thing.  Will probably try grilling it again, but just plain pineapple.

Huge hit at dinner tonight served with pork chops!  With a bit more honey, chili oil instead of hot sauce, and garnished with sprinkled Saigon Cinnamon, this is going to be a regular at our house.

These were great.  I marinated them for about 1.5 hours and followed the recipe as written, other than not coring my pineapple (I find them easier to grill that way).  I was worried about the hot sauce but we could not tell that it was there, it only tempered the sweetness, which made this a great side dish for kabobs.

Very nice with just a hint of hot sauce.  I'll probably add more hot sauce the next time, as I think it's a nice counterbalance to the sweetness of the grilled pineapple.

Good dessert!  We combine brown sugar and rum, then pour over sliced fresh pineapple rings.  Marinate 2-24 hours, then grill. our favorite and the alcohol burns off so all can enjoy.

This was amazing!  I squirted in a generous amount of sriracha for the hot sauce, and the result was delicious.  Can't wait to make this again and again.  

I did cut the butter in half to make it more healthy.

I added some cinnamon to the marinade.  If you marinate overnight I would recommended taking the pineapple out of the refridgerator at least 30 minutes before grilling to let the butter soften.

This grilled pineapple tasted very good but we didn't taste the honey and hot sauce that much.  Next time I'll add a little more of each.

Excellent!  I cut into spears instead of circles.  Still worked.  I have a very discerning four year old, and she LOVED it.  Will definitely do again.  Very Easy.  Followed the exact recipe.  Thanks

Simple, easy to prepare side dish that can accompany countless dishes.  Adjust recipe measures to suit tastes.  As written is fine, with just the right amount of heat.  Heat it up with extra hot sauce if you've got fire eaters around the table, sweeten it with brown sugar if the main course recommends it.  Check out the reviews for variations on ingredients and pineapple prep.  The Allrecipe community is a creative one, you'll find neat ideas and hints on preparation and no shortage of reviews to put a smile of your face.  (My kids love the basher reviews that change all the ingredients and cooking instructions then slam the recipe with low scores. What's up with that?). I served the grilled pineapple with Kalua Pig, perfect combo.

Loved it. I too used canned pineapple and while fresh probably would have been better canned worked perfectly well. I followed the recipe, just added a couple dashes more of hot sauce. Went great with the spareribs we had for dinner. Would marinate longer next time. Will definitely be making this a lot this summer!

Very similar to a recipe I have been using, the difference being the use of black pepper rather than hot sauce.  We prefer the black pepper and no salt.  Although I love how it looks sliced in rings, most of the time I slice wedges from top to bottom.  Just lends itself to more convenient cooking.  If my grill is full, I do these in a skillet on the stove.  Delish!

Outstanding! Sweetness of the pineapple and richness of the butter are a glorious combination, the hit of spice provides some balance.

I give this four stars based solely on the fact that you can't miss with grilled pineapple. Based on other reviews I really expected a more elevated flavor profile from the hot sauce and honey. In all honesty I did add a tablespoon of honey because what is the point of 1/4 tsp. of honey? Next time I'll just skip the additional preparation and just grill it. ;-)

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was FANTASTIC.  The only thing that I had to change was I used fresh pineapple wedges (rings were sold out).  It is a definate keeper and there can be quite a variety of twists put into this recipe!

Delicious.  I've made these twice in the past week now.  I will definitely be experimenting with different flavors as well.  Like balsamic vinegar, extra hot sauce, grand mariner etc...  But this recipe is too easy not to do.

I just bought a pineapple slicer and tried it out and used this terrific recipe.  I added a pinch of cinnamon to the ingredients.  We had this with grilled salmon and asparagus wrapped with prosciutto.  I will make this again.  Vacu Vin pineapple slicer worked great too!

Pineapple is among our very favorite things to grill. Recently we have been mixing a slurry of brown sugar and Gran Marnier and drizzling it over pineapple wedges as they cook. Not much sticks, but the flavor is off the charts!

I hink the person who put this with icecream and suggest sherbert was a little confussed, this is not a dessert.  We have had this many times at a locale Brazilian grill diner.  Had with grilled pork and chicken.  It was great, didn't mess with the ingredience.

This was really good. Fresh and simple. I did not add hot sauce becuase I have a nine year old that wouldn't have eaten them. Every piece was gone and they were looking for more.

Love this grilled pineapple recipe!  Made it at least  3 times! Disappeared from the serving platter in the blink of an eye!  Whole family loved it.  Did not make any changes.

We couldn't taste the marinade at all, even though I doubled up on the honey, but it was still good. I think that with a little tweaking, this will be terrific.  I look forward to trying it again.

I’ve made this according to the recipe several times.  It makes a great side for a steak dinner along with grilled veggies, served alone or with grilled pears for dessert, or diced and added to coleslaw for a BBQ feast.  Everyone I’ve served it to loves it.

I used a little Sriracha as the hot sauce. Although I only marinated it about a half hour, the pineapple was still nicely flavored. My husband loved it.

I made this recipe as is with the exception of cutting the pineapple into spears instead of rings. Turned out really juicy and REALLY sweet! I actually dipped mine in a bit of salt as I was eating to cut the sweetness some. Would be really good in a cole slaw or in a margarita!

Really easy and  my guests loved it. We don’t have a grill handy so I did it on a very hot grill pan on the stove. Worked just fine. I thought the hot sauce was a great idea, used about 1/8 tsp, and kept it from being too sweet.

I used 1/4 tsp sriracha instead of the hot sauce, and I only had about 3 minutes to marinade (we're procrastinators)!  But these were amazing. My kids and whole family loved them! Can't wait to make them again! 

I hate when people say they loved (or hated) a recipe when they report they changed many of the ingredients or instructions. But today, that was me. Sorry! However, my changes were only based out of necessity (used the time & ingredients I had available).

Love pineapple,grilled. Love spicy food. I did my pineapple in a skillet on the stove top. Too cold out now to use a grill. I took a reviewer’s suggestion and drizzled sweet chili sauce over my pineapple.

This was good, and  if you are looking for alternatives for using a disappointing, not-so-sweet pineapples it might be the way to go. I followed the recipe exactly, and we did like it, but the pineapple I used was so super sweet and delicious that it was better raw with nothing added.

These were awesome! Like others I questioned the hot sauce but what a lovely complimentary taste, I added more honey.
I  had them with turkey cutlets. 
Definitely a keeper, & so easy!

These are soooo Dang delicious! I used the exact ingredients it called for only more of ea, I wanted more juice. Instead of  cutting it in rings, I cut 8 strips  from top to bottom. Then trimmed core pc off of each, then the outside skin. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't change a thing except I didn't core the pineapple, simply cut it into slices for easier handling on the grill. So good.  Served alongside grilled pork chops for an excellent Sunday bbq.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have great pineapple, so I used canned (in its own juice). I used three drops Cholula hot sauce since that was what I had on hand, and I omitted the salt. The hot sauce gave it an absolutely delicious smoky flavor!!...with no heat! This was awesome!! I will make this often!!

This was very tasty, even my picky step children ate it! I did not have time to marinate it and it would be better if allowed to do so (next time). easy for me to make at our cabin with limited kitchen resources!

Great side dish to any bbq'd chicken or pork!!! If your clan doesn't like the hot sauce, try hoisin sauce... either way is a winner!!

Yes, I made changes. I used brown sugar and siracha then grilled it; near the end, I dabbed margarine on each slice. My daughter said it was too hot; my husband said it was good but not great. I ate one piece and decided that it wasn't all that spectacular for my taste. And yet, it is a good recipe. That said, I had read all of the 115 reviews and some of the highest reviews did what I did. I'd cook this again with a ripe pineapple, but I would not serve it to guests for fear their mouths would light up and not particularly with delight, but with heat.

I cut three whole pineapples into spears and grilled according to the recipe. These were SO GOOD and disappeared before any of the other food. Yum!

For a very quick version, you can simply brush pineapple with olive oil on both sides and sprinkle with cayenne pepper.  Beware, a little cayenne can go a long way.  These are sweet hot.  Looking forward to trying this recipe as well.

Had to cook this under the broiler as it was too cold to cook outside on the grill--worked well anyway and was SO tasty!   Made the recipe as stated with no changes.  This will stay in my "Favorites" file!

I almost left out the hot sauce because that sounded weird but after reading reviews just went for it. I used sriracha as the hot sauce and was very surprised. Even my fiance who doesn't like pineapple had seconds (after I made him try it first). I will be making this again very soon! I will admit that the pineapple I had used was a little under ripe so it was slightly stiffer helping it hold together on the grill.

My husband and I made these tonight and absolutely enjoyed them. I don't measure so my recipe probably ended up with more honey. I cannot eat dairy, so I used a margarine type spread instead of the butter it calls for. We used Tapatio for our hot sauce. I did not add salt, but sprinkled Tajin on the finished product. We both like spice, so we will probably add more hot sauce next time around. A yummy dessert after our grilled meal! Thank you for recipe!

I haven't tried this version yet but I sure will.  I do have to recommend a  quick recipe that a friend gave me last summer.  3 ingredients, fresh pineapple, dark rum and brown sugar......trim the pineapple skin off, after removing the top and bottom.  cut the remaining large piece in half. core it by making two angled cuts into the core. then cut the pineapple into spears from top to bottom.  You will have at least 10-12.  
Marinade the pineapple spears in rum for a few hours with brown sugar sprinkled over the top.  Grill until 2 minutes per side, serve with vanilla ice cream.  Company and husband alike raved about it!!!!!!

Very tasty! We are a spice heavy household so I doubled the amount of honey and hot sauce (Sriracha) and marinated overnight. Flavor is subtle, but definitely there. Used some of the rings to make a version of Big Kahuna burgers (Sriracha and General Tso's sauce mixed in the ground chuck); delicious!

Made this tonight and it was surprisingly fantastic, not to mention easy to make. Used sriracha instead of hot sauce, and might have added a splash of rum into the mix. Turned out pineapple that was really juicy, flavorful, and the grill marks added a nice crunch and flavor to it.

I've made this side many times since discovering the recipe.  I often substitute a bit of brown sugar for the honey and it makes it caramelize nicely.  I've also taken to adding a dash of Chinese five spice to the marinade, it takes it up another notch :)

Sweet, juicy and delectable. What a surprise! I did not think I'd like this but I loved it. I added 3 dashes ghost pepper sauce and a little extra honey. I did not core and cut in half inch slices rather than inch slices. I don't think it matters much because it would have been delicious either way. What a unique side to serve, like I did, with the Key West chicken and black bean and corn salad II from this site. Very tropical!

These were fantastic. I added a little extra tabasco to mine after they were grilled. Sweet, salty, and spicy.
