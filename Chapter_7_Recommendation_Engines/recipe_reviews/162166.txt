Great recipe but make sure to be liberal with the salt and pepper.  The recipe to add says to taste, but game meat contains no salt so don't be afraid to put extra on.  I also made an herb brown gravy to touch it up with and it was very nice!

Wow, this recipe is fantastic!! I'm not a meat eater, to be honest, but I made this for friends and family becaue I was given several pounds of elk from a neighbor. I made some for myself, sans the elk, and I was amazed at how delicious parsnips are.  I followed the recipe to a T for everyone and they raved about the elk version. I felt especially proud that I can still cook a "meat" dish that tastes delicious. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  I made a few slight changes - instead of frozen veggies, I used fresh (asparagus, red bell pepper, broccoli and carrots).  I also added minced garlic along with the garlic powder.  We are always looking for good game meat recipes and this is definately a keeper!!

This was great! I used a whole pound of elk meat and used a casserole dish. Four potatoes was still a lot to pile on top. My ten month old ate like a man and even loved the parsnip! I wasn't comfortable salting it as much as it needed with the baby eating with us, but just left the salt shaker out and it was fine.

Great recipe.  Pretty much followed it with the exception that I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  My picky daughter really likes this recipe and actually haves seconds.  Big hit for the whole family..

My family loved this recipe!! I did make a couple of changes though. I used ground beef instead of the elk, I used 2 large cloves of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder and after spreading the melted butter on the potatoes my daughter grated a light layer of asiago on top. Delish!! Because I have to feed a large family I doubled the recipe and baked this in a deep casserole dish. This is a fantastic recipe and my family has requested that it be served regularly. (Next time I will make a gravy with the meat layer.)

I don't really have access to ground elk, so I just used ground beef, and this was absolutely delicious.  I have a daughter with celiac disease, and this recipe is also gluten free.  Excellent dish that has made my recipe rotation.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe without processed foods and cream soups!

Good recipe... But technically, wouldn't this be "Hunter's Pie"? Just a thought. Shepherd's pie is lamb. You know... From the "Shepherd's" flock.

We were given ground elk meat by some family members who hunt. We had no idea how to cook it, so I turned to my favorite recipe site and found this shepherd's pie.

I follow a low-carb high-fat way of eating, so instead of potatoes, I microwaved cauliflower and mushrooms until both were soft soft soft. Then I put them through a food processor with butter and cream until they were blended perfectly smooth like mashed potatoes. For the veggies I used asparagus, mushrooms, spinach and onion, and also minced garlic.

My family went NUTS over it, as did I. Unbelievable taste and all around texture. All I can say is WOW! And thanks!
The photo is the result of the meal.

This recipe was very flavorful and my first experience with parsnip and elk.
Since the recipe is a bit time consuming I cooked the meat (2 lbs) prior to leaving for work, and removed from frig. placed in glass pie plate while preparing other ingredients.  I must say "finally a way to make frozen vegetables edible".
I didnâ€™t have Italian season so I looked it and had all the ingredients but sage, so I used rosemary and took the advice with the salt and seasonings to taste.  My family enjoyed this dinner and we have leftovers.  I froze the remaining meat to use for either another pie or spaghetti sauce.  Yum! Nicely written directions.  I think parsnip would make a great smelling candle:)...

Didn't have any Elk but I did have ground venison available. I did add a couple touches that I thought would add to the recipe. First, since venison and Elk are VERY lean, after browning the meat, I added a can of beef broth and simmered it until the broth was cooked off to add some fat and flavor. Second I added one can of drained Rotel since I believe Shepherds pie should have tomato, and the added kick of the Rotel is always a plus.

We followed recipe, as is, but used 1 lb ground venison in place of elk and then doubled the Italian seasoning.  We always use fresh garlic and then added a little shredded cheese to Potato mixture, too :) This was delish and easy to make! Our 12 month of loved it, too!

Pretty good.  Though it wouldn't be fair as I put in vegetables a really didn't like.  Nothing like a good mound of mashed potatoes to cover those.
I did not use parsnips as I really really don't like those.
I used Moose meat. 
I put garlic in with the mashed potatoes while they were cooking so I omitted the garlic powder.
My mixed veggies was califlower, brocoli and carrot. I also added peas.
On top of the mashed potatoes, just before putting in oven I added parsley and a couple of cut up green onion...just to be different.
I found the shepherd's pie dry but that is most likely cause the moose meat was so lean. I had zero drippings for cooking the veggies so I added a bit a vegetable oil to the pan and covered them for steaming...

Strongly Addictive and Tasty! I normally cook with Game Meat, never Hamburger. The Recipe is a Terrific way to Compliment the Elk.

We loved it!  I couldnt help but smile in affirmation with what the previous comments said about their picky kids and this meal. My picky son loved it.  I made some modifications though, since I didnt have much of the spices, I used bay leaf and worchestershire sauce for depth of flavor. I used the available veggies in the ref as well, carrots peppers and asparagus in lieu of the veggie mix.

Delicious recipe!  Made elk for the first time tonight with this recipe and loved it.   I varied it just slightly - instead of italian seasoning, instead used porcini salt which was a-mazing!  nice mix of veggies and the elk has a nice mild flavor that was well suited for this dish.  great recipe - thanks for the idea!

Easy to make and tasted good. Turned out a little dry some made some Bisto gravy to moisten the meat mixture. My ground elk is fat free so that contributed to the dryness.

This was my first time trying elk and this recipe was very good for an introduction. My elk didn't taste very gamey at all, although I did rinse it before cooking. It only gets 4 stars because it's a pretty basic recipe. Nothing spectacular, but it definitely served its purpose. Also, I used 1lb of elk and it was still very good.

I used 1 # hamburger instead of elk and sour cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and 1/2 tsp. minced garlic instead of powder.  I also added 1 diced medium peeled apple, 1/2 cup carrot, 1//2 cup peas, 1/2 tsp thyme.  This makes a great gluten free dinner.

Tasted good, wife liked it...but the meat needs some kind of sauce to give it body and  juices....next time I'd add a can of diced tomatoes, along with some additional spices. OR some added brown gravy to the meat part...something to juice it up.

excellent!!! we used venison instead of elk. also I used rustic herb seasoning from tastefully simple instead of Italian seasoning. it definitely needs a gravy. next time I will pour a beef gravy over the veggies and meat before putting potatoes on! so good!!!

This was fantastic, I mean who doesn't love Shepherd's Pie? I'm sure it would have been great as is, but I made a few changes. I used a few extra dashes of salt and doubled Italian seasoning, used fresh garlic and a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce in the meat mixture. Used carrots instead of parsnip (what I had on hand). I added the garlic powder to the mashed potatoes instead and added cheddar to potatoes as well. Served with sauteed Brussel sprouts and carrots, YUM!

We made this using ground venison. It was tasty!  Next time I'll add some sauce to the meat. Not sure what but I think I'd like a little gravy. We'll definitely make it again!  It's always fun to use our garden potatoes as well :-)

Made this according to the recipe only I used deer meat.  It was my first time using ground deer and it was delicious!!!  My husband LOVED it!  I did add 2 potatoes to feed our large family, and had very little leftover.  Will definitely make again!
