I've been on a deviled egg roll this last couple of days!  Here is another winner!  Yummy combination of ingredients!  For the onion I used a shallot (all I had on hand), and otherwise, I followed the amounts in the ingredient list.  Yummy!  Thanks, ChristinaMarie.

I really liked this - it has a nice creaminess which the horseradish counterbalances.  I'll add a little more horseradish and a pinch of salt next time, out of personal taste.  It's a nice variant of the devilled egg!

I made these yesterday, well kind of this recipe. I had never used cream cheese in deviled eggs, but i think of cream cheese kind of the same as bacon. Cream cheese makes everything better. I used Mayo, Cream Cheese, Spicy Brown Mustard and Horseradish. I had a guest that "hates" horseradish, after he had eaten half the plate I told him what was in them. :)

My wife liked it more; me not so much but it was OK. Recipe was followed fairly close but had to use some spicy mustard as I ran low on powder. I picked this  mainly because of the cream cheese as I like creamy recipes.  Final taste for me, I think you really need to like horseradish more than cream cheese.

Addding cream cheese gave a little needed firmness and a creamy,flavor.  Horseradish keeps the deviled eggs from being bland.

These were very good. Took to a potluck and they were quickly consumed.  Nice change, horseradish gave a little zing and cream cheese added a nice smooth consistency.

I didn't add the onion, salt, vinegar, and a little more horseradish.  I went ahead and filled my eggs and had almost half left in my bowl that absolutely wouldn't fit in the eggs; way too much filling!  I did not lioke the taste.
