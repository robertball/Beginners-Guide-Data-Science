I wanted a recipe that was classic and easy.  I haven't had an easier time making cheesecake.  I don't put the topping on because it is great without it.  ALWAYS let your cold ingredients come to room temperature before you make cheesecake.

I have made this recipe 3 times and my husband and I love it! I prebake the crust at 300' for ten minutes and I bake the cheesecake on top of a water bath.  This helps to bake it evenly and helps it to not crack on top. It is also important to allow it to cool inside the oven with the door only slightly cracked to prevent cooler air to rush in the oven. This also causes cracks in the cake.it is very easy and has a nice smooth creamy texture. The taste has a touch of sweet but not overly so. Enjoy !

This is a great recipe. I tried it twice and nailed it the 2nd time around. It's very creamy, not too sweet. Served it with lemon curd and strawberry sauce on the side.

Notes:

-This is more of a 10" and not a 9"

-I put foil around my pan to prevent it from cracking

-Started it on 350 but then turned it down to 300 after about 10 mins in.

-towards the end I turned off the oven and cracked the door and let it cool in the oven.

-added an extra tsp of vanilla and a little lemon zest

-did a little more butter in the crust and added some cinnamon. 

These notes are what I did the 2nd time around and got a great cheesecake

First off, it says 9 inch pan. I used  9 inch and there was WAY too much filling for it. It started settling and overflowed - a lot.

I used a waterbath, it still cracked a lot and was very brown on top regardless of using minimum cooking time.  Not a big deal, planned to use a topping. (Country cherry)

Tastes amazing. Everyone thought it was to DIE for. Never buying premade cheesecake again. 

Making my second one tonight! 

Using 10inch pan, baking 1hr at 300 degrees. Waterbath. Topping with raspberries, blackberries and strawberry medley.

Great! Exactly what I was hoping for-- easy, creamy, delicious.  Made four small cakes in my mini cheese cake spring forms.   Stirred chocolate chips into one and topped another with strawberries.  So good.  Made exactly as directed, barring the name brands :).

So when I made it (and I followed everything to a T, and I added the water bath, it came out way brown on top. What did I do wrong? 350 degrees for one hour.

This cheesecake is delicious and pretty easy to make. It was my first time making a cheesecake so I read through many of these reviews prior to. I added some cinnamon to the crust like one other reviewer did - and added some lemon juice and lemon extract to the filling - it was just a slight lemon flavor but perfect! 
I also prebaked the crust for 10 mins at 300 degrees, then filled it and baked for about 1 hr 10 mins at 350 in a water bath. Then turned the oven off and cracked the door to allow it to cool slowly. It has no cracks and was fully cooked perfectly.  

Also another note - many reviews stated that it was too much filling for a 9" pan - I believe they were using store-bought pie crusts as those pans are much smaller in volume than a SPRINGFORM 9" pan. The filling amount was perfect for a springform pan.

This cheesecake was easy to make and delicious. Because I'm just starting out (I'm 23), I don't have a lot of baking equipment  and I had to use a regular dish instead of a springform pan. Well, I'm assuming that's what caused the cheesecake to crack. It was just for me and my hubby, so appearance didn't matter so much! Also,  I feel like the filling should be split between two smaller cakes, because it overflows with just one. Other than appearance, the cake was delicious. :) Instead of a cherry topping, I made a blueberry syrup to pour over it. Yummm!

1st time using this recipe and it turned out awesome!! When my husband started eating it, he was so quiet. I was afraid that it didn't taste good. Turned out that he enjoyed it so much that he has no words to describe it. I also made strawberry compote to compliment the cheesecake. But it is also good on its own. I followed some of the reviews to leave it in the oven to cool and waited till it is at room temperature before transferring it to the fridge. No cracks at all and the texture is super smooth. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

Amazing!!! Restaurant worthy. I didn't have graham but I did have Oreo crumbs so I used that. And I used full fat gaylee sour cream. Way too much batter for a 9"pie plate so kids and I had to eat the remaining from the bowl!!!  Will have to go out and get a spring form pan and make again!  There goes my will power. Will definitely make for our next family get together. Love love !!

I have made this multiple times and it's been excellent every time. I did drop the temperature to 300 and baked it longer which seemed to give it a silkier texture. It's also great paired with rasberry coolie or a tart lemon curd. 
Great receipe

This cheesecake recipe is fantastic! I live in China where cheesecake is very expensive and usually imported so not fresh and honest not to good. Unfortunately, I am unable to find the specific brand names the recipe calls for so I just use what ever cream cheese I can find at the international store and I make my own sour cream. I love this recipe and even my Chinese friends ask me to make it for them (note: it's a bit sweet so If you not a huge sweet fan you can reduce the sugar and it doesn't make a huge difference to the cake).

This truly is the best recipe for cheesecake ever.  Although i have a tendency to alter recipes to personal taste, i made it exactly according to the directions and there is no way i can think of to improve upon this one.  I made a simple raspberry sauce from frozen berries, sugar and tapioca starch, and chocolate drizzle. Baked the cake in a non-stick springform pan over a water bath to ensure no cracking, though i think you would be okay not doing the water bath. Creamy, moist, not too sweet, super easy to make. Took it to a holiday potluck and people could not stop raving about it.

I uses vanilla wafers crumbs in place of the graham crackers crumbs.  I also baked until set and turned off the oven  and left the door opened, but left the cheesecake in there until cooled.  It did not crack.  I added more vanilla then called for too!  So easy and good,

I used to always make the cheesecake recipe that is on the back of the cream cheese package along with a Keebler ready made pie crust.  Never ever again.  This recipe is perfection.  Do not hesitate to make it.  Omg it is delicious!!!  I didn't have a springform pan so I used a deep dish pie plate the a sprayed with pan to ensure it wouldn't stick.  I used a pack and a half of graham crackers and crushed them in a food processor.  Since I didn't feel like messing the mixer I rinsed and dried the food processor bowl and used that to mix all the ingredients and I think that may have helped making this cheesecake so amazingly creamy and delicious.  I may experiment with different types of crusts like nilla wafer or oreo.  This is a fantastic recipe.  I cooked it in a pan with about an inch of water on 300 for about an hour and ten mins.  Seriously.  Perfect!!!!!

I made this for 4th of July and it was great, definitely a recipe to keep but oh so rich. I did not use the cherry filling topping so my rating is for the cake part itself. I wanted to make it into a 4th of July flag so for the topping I used Cool Whip and halved strawberries for red stripes, and blue berries for the stars.  I got the flag idea from other recipes listed but liked the ingredients and how this one was made. I did not have a spring pan, so I just used a rectangular pan. There was some cracking, but the cool whip topping easily covered that up. Also I used light cream cheese and light sour cream.

I have made this 3 times now and i can wholeheartedly say its the best cheesecake i have ever had the pleasure of eating. Here are my alterations that led my dad to giving me 20$ for the last slice : 

-1/2 cup of unsalted butter for the crust and i didn't add sugar because the only graham crackers i could find already have honey. 
- bake the crust for ten minutes before putting the mix in 
- try to have the cold ingredients reach room temperature before mixing them. 
- if you want a more solid cake, use bars of cream cheese
- put a generous amount of blueberries and raspberries into the mix 
- wrap the springform pan in tinfoil and put it in a water bath for even cooking and to prevent cracking 
- cook the cheesecake for 10 minutes at 350 then lower to 300 for 50 minutes (or until centre is jiggly) then crack open the oven door and let it cool that way. 

My major change: 

Instead of using canned cherry filling, i put 2 cups of raspberries through a strainer and then simmer it with a third a cup of sugar and the juice of a slice of lemon. When the cheesecake is cooled i pour it atop and then put fresh raspberries and blueberries on it, the raspberry puree will relatively solidify in the fridge. The last time i did it, i actually mixed half of the puree into half of the cheesecake mix to make a pink and white design and it looked really nice. 
Enjoy!!! :)

I was so disappointed in this cheesecake, I don't understand the mostly 5 star reviews. I bake often and love baking so I'm not a novice. The texture was WAY off. Flavor was decent, a little different than classic cheesecake but the texture was what made it not good. My husband and sons even said something. The texture was not creamy, it's hard to explain it was almost a little curdly but you didn't taste bumps. I mixed everything well. It was just off. Will look for another recipe.

I followed the exact recipe, EXCEPT I substituted almond extract for vanilla.   I meant to do half vanilla and half almond, but accidently dumped the whole amount in almond.  So, I used no vanilla.  I also used farm-fresh eggs, which were probably jumbo size.  It was slightly eggy, but I imagine with large grocery store eggs, it would be fine.

As far as a water bath goes, I did wet two kitchen towels and wrap them around the springform pan.  I have seen that on other websites as a different option.  I can't say whether it works or not, but I will say that mine did not crack.  It turned out beautifully, except when I ran a knife around the edge, it kinda tore up the sides, so I'll have to figure something out there.

I will definitely be making this recipe, again, though!

This is by far the BEST cheesecake recipe I've ever used, and I've tried many! I didn't have graham crackers so I used butter crackers and added a little cinnamon and extra sugar to the crust. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and baked the crust for 10 minutes at 350 degrees prior to filling and baking the cake. No need for a water bath, and it's wonderful even without the pie filling. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Having never made a cheesecake before, I tried this thinking it would be easy. Not only did my 10 yr old daughter do most, it was the most delicious cheesecake ever! I even made another and mixed in 1/2 cup pumpkin for a delicious pumpkin cheesecake. Awesome and easy recipe!!!

I made this for our Easter dinner and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was to use a pecan crust instead of the graham crust. That really made it scrumptious!

Turned out perfectly. Like someone else said on here, let your ingredients come up to room temperature to avoid lumps. If your graham crackers have honey in them already, you may not need to add too much sugar to the crust. I prebaked my crust at 300 for 10 minutes. Baked the cheesecake at 350 for 10 minutes and then at 300 for 50. Left it to cool in the oven with the door open and then put it in the fridge. No cracking whatsoever and I didn't even use a water bath! Delicious with a strawberry sauce.

6-6-2019 ~This is just what I have come to expect from any Philadelphia Brand cheesecake recipe.  You can bake any of them, this one included, confidently with predictably good results and with easy preparation because of its simplicity.  Once out of the oven, run a knife around the cheesecake, then open the rim and let it cool. This should prevent any cracking.  Be careful not to over bake – if it starts to get too brown on the top, lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top until done, with a small jiggle in the center.

good basic recipe.  I always wrap my springform pan in foil and place the cheesecake in a baking dish with 1 inch of hot water.

Very disappointed in this cheesecake. It rose about an inch and a half above the pan and then as it cooled it all collapsed into the Center. Top cracked badly and when all said and done the crust stuck to the pan bottom. Hardly any flavor in this cake. I won’t be making it again.

I don't like to rate if I made changes but mine had nothing to do with the filling. I didn't make the topping or the crust because we never eat the crust.  I did make it in a springform pan.  I put a pan underneath incase it dripped but it didn't.  We really enjoyed it and I will make it again.
thanks for a great recipe

The first time I made it,  it came out fantastic.  Today I've made it about 5 times with rave reviews. Although one person said the cake was grainy and that I should not have added milk. Clearly she didn't know what she was talking about because the recipe has no milk.

Made this for a family gathering at home and there was hardly a crumb left! This is my first attempt at making cheesecake and it came out perfect. This recipe is a great one to start with. 
Like some other reviewers suggested, for the crust, I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and cut back sugar  to 2 Tb, blind baked for 10 min at 350F. I made sure other ingredients are at room temperature. I whisked the sour cream and sugar (3/4 cup) first before adding cream cheese (2x 8 oz Philadelphia regular and 1x 8 oz Philadelphia light cream cheese), vanilla, lemon juice and combined them well. Then poured in gently whisked  eggs until just combined. Baked the cake in a water bath though at 300F for 50 mins, opened the oven a crack and let it cool in the oven before popping it in the fridge overnight.

This was a disgusting abomination of a cheesecake. It was neither creamy nor delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and what came out was less cheesecake and more quichecake. Do yourself a favor and 86 the eggs/baking part and do up a nice no-bake

Exactly what I wanted. Eat it before cooling if you want lighter, softer texture. Once cooled, it a classic, dense cheesecake ( which is what I wanted.)

I made this last night. It was amazing. I did do a few things differently. I used Wal-Mart brand sour cream which was perfectly fine & Keebler pre-made crust. I also only baked it for about 45 minutes & topped with strawberries. But the inside was amazing. I don't recommend pre-made crust bc it became a little chewy but all in all was delicious.

This is amazing  the only thing i did diffrent was use a pre made pie crust from the store so you only need ome cup of sugar and if u are going to use a 8inch pie crust get two if u dont u will have extra batter and AlWAYS make sure your cream cheese is room temp

Perfect recipe. I followed directions exactly, but served with fresh berries instead of canned cherries. I liked that this recipe had plenty of graham cracker crust. Good texture and taste. This will be my new go to recipe.

I loved this! Added some Godiva chocolate chips! Going too make it again today with blueberry preserves.  The only thing I will change this go around is the cooking time. It came out a little more golden than I would have liked. Still very tasty!

High altitude: after 45 mins, reduce heat to 325 add 15 mins cook time. My top cracked.  Wish i would have done the water bath.  Taste was fabulous.  I skipped the cherries and went with flavored caramel.

I had been making another cheesecake on this site for the past two years and decided to try this.  Absolutely the best.  I decided to take the flavor profile and change it to lemon so I added some lemon juice instead of vanilla to the filling.  Will definitely make again.

This is the recipe that started it all. Before this, everything I ever made came from a box.
But I've come a long way in the last 4 weeks!
I've made this 4 times already!
I failed miserably my first attempt. Butter from the crust  leaked out of the bottom of my new Springform pan & dripped down onto the heating elements in the oven. Before I knew what happened, there was thick black smoke everywhere!
That was Christmas Eve.
The next day I saw the most amazing thing...
A recipe for
MINI Cheesecakes!
No springforn pan!

Bottom line, I use this recipe (minus the topping) but I put them in muffin tins.
Outstanding!!!!!!
(Seriously, they're freaking amazing! And soooo easy!)

First time I made this I had left over cheesecake. It was also a brown color on the top. The 2nd time I made it with the little bit of left over cheesecake and cut the recipe in half. I also put the temperature to 350.  No brown on top and lush and thick!

It was easy to make but it came out very fluffy. I like a more heavier cheesecake. I will definitely make it again

My granddaughter can’t eat gluten, so I made a gluten free crust with almond flour. We skipped the topping because it was delicious without it! 
I’m sure it would be great with the topping, too. 
It was very easy to make compared to other cheesecakes I’ve made.

Yes I used the 1/3 less cream cheese however it must be room temp to mix well with sugar.  I also used a 10 inch spring pan so I had to make a bit more crust.

Easy to make and fit perfectly in a 9” SPRINGFORM pan. Next time I will add some cinnamon to the crust, or use Oreos, just because I like to change things up. It turned out great and everyone loved it. I was even short on time and had to speed up the cooling and it still came out great.

Was excellent I made 3 of them at same time. Two of them I used the water bath and there were no cracks. I had only one crack on the one that did not have water bath. Extremely good flavor.

First time baking a cheesecake and it turned out amazing! I followed some of the other reviewers and baked the crust for 10 mins at 300 before adding the filling. I also baked the cheesecake in a waterbath for 10 mins at 350 and turned the temp down to 300 for the remainder of the hour. Got no cracks!

Will make again, never made cheesecake before and it was amazing, silky smooth and tasty! Used less sugar in the crust by 1/2 and added cinnamon as well. Ensured the sour cream and cream cheese were at room temperature. Lightly beat the eggs and folded in to be safe. Cooked the crust at 350 for 15min and then cooked the cake for 1hr15min at 300. Center 2in diameter should be jiggly and you don’t want any browning so you have to use a water bath for that even cooking. The whole family had multiple servings over a few days.

I made this cheesecake for an impromptu Labor Day party.  Everyone was amazed that it was so easy to make.  Sadly, there were no leftovers to take home.  But we all suffered through eating this delicious cheesecake.  I made a strawberry sauce & had whipped cream in case anyone wanted to embellish their piece.

After searching for a cheesecake recipe, I thought I'd try it since it had a 5 star rating. Don't waste your money on making this it was horrible!! No flavor , the texture was weird, sort of like custard, not creamy at all!! I suppose if you have never had cheesecake you might think this is good, taste nothing like cheesecake. I'll keep searching for a  recipe!

I discovered I had no sugar, so I used Splenda for the graham cracker crust, which, when cooked in the oven came out nearly burnt.  I borrowed some sugar for the cream cheese filling. The springform pan is really 10." I really feel like I messed up this time, but the jury is still out because it's in the oven now.

I don’t eat cheesecake but I love making it. I used this recipe for the first time and my work people LOVED it!! My cheesecakes always crack but I cooked it in a water bath for the first time and it turned out AMAZING!! No cracks! I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

This is my first time making cheese cake and I must say I knocked it out the park with this preparation. I added two tablespoons of fresh lemon zest loosely packed and a pan of water beneath the cake in the oven. I made my own blueberry compote for the top and perfecto! Even the cheese cake haters loved it.

Came out perfect by the recipe....no water bath, no cracking either!  Just beautiful!!  I think the secret is to add the eggs in slowly...don't whip in any air at the end!

I made this and thought it wasn't worth eating.  It didn't taste like cheesecake and the consistency wasn't smooth.  No one in my house liked it.

Nailed this recipe 3 out of 3 times. Sometimes it cracks (over mixed) but no one knows once you top it. Our favorite topping is cherry. I have not tweeked the recipe or cooked it differently that what the recipe calls for. The recipe is perfect as written. Thank you!

I have made this recipe about 5 times now. It is really elegant and simple. I substitute ginger snaps for the graham crackers and omit the sugar in the crust. My family insists on it at Thanksgiving. In my oven I set the oven to 350 and then reduce to 300 for an hour. Then, like the other, I turn off the oven and open the door a crack. I also use a water bath just below the pans.

Was a little intimidated going into this, but it turned out fabulous! Took tips from the other reviews and cooked at 350 for 10 min then lowered to 300 for remaining hour. Cooked in a water bath, wrapped the pan in a slow cooker liner & tinfoil, then put in another pan. Filled water until about 1/2 up the pan. Cracked the oven door after the hour was up and let cool in the oven. No cracks in the top, baked beautifully. Will definitely bake again! No more NoBake Cheesecake for my family!!

I made this for my son’s birthday as he doesn’t like regular cake. I was nervous because it was the first time I made baked cheesecake and it couldn’t have turned out better!  I bought two cans of pie filling so people could choose which they wanted to top it with. I’m making it again to take to church. Will double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan... wish me luck!

Since it’s Fall, I added pumpkin pie spice to the graham cracker crust. Thinking of using Bischoff cookies next time! I also added a half cup of pumpkin purée to cheesecake filling and a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice. Prebaked the crust for 10 minutes at 350, but reduced the temp to 300 and put a large Pyrex bowl of water in the oven to halt any cracking. Added a topping of 1 c sour cream, 1/4 c sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the top after baking and put in fridge for 4 hours. I also made it in a 9x13. Delish!!

Pretty easy to make.  First try my water bath leaked and made edge of crust soggy.  My kids didn't mind though.  Next try I used a slow cooker bag around springform pan with no leaks.

I absolutely loved making this recipe! Easy to follow and clear directions . The only thing I did differently was bake the crust for 10 mins. After an hour I turned the heat down to 225 I think it was and finished it for 20 mins. I wrapped the spring pan on bottom and sides with foil. Didn’t have a big enough pan for a water bath but clearly didn’t need it. I used a 10” spring pan based off of reviews. Can’t wsit to try it! Thanks!

I only baked for 45 minutes, which is about how long it usually takes my oven to bake. I also used a water bath. Other than that I made no changes, and got told it was the best cheesecake my guests ever had!

I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't quite turn out the way I expected. I used a 9" pan as the recipe specified and ended up having too much so I made two cheesecakes. They came out a little brown on top and cracked.  I had made a blueberry topping for it and that turned out good but didn't add much sweetness. It tasted much better when I put a little caramel on top instead of the blueberries. That made it sweeter and quite delicious. With the caramel and whip cream on top, I would give it a "5."

Delicious! Before pouring it into the crust, I whisked in 2 tbsp of matcha powder into some of the batter and mixed it into the cheesecake mixture to make a green tea cheesecake. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious. It was so creamy, slightly tangy from the sour cream, and not to sweet. My family loved it!

I've had better. It was not as creamy as I had hoped. A bit too cheesy tasting. The only reason I tried this one over another one is because my favorite one calls for 4- 8oz pkgs. cream cheese and I only had 3 so I made this one. I don;t think I will bother making this recipe again.

I would definitely make this again. Had good texture, good flavour and it baked easy in the water bath. A good go to recipe for cheesecake.

I had never made cheese cake prior to 4 days ago. I made this recipe thursday for a work bakesale friday. Made my own cherry topping. Was a hit!
I followed the recipe pretty closely. Though i used 3 tbsp brown sugar and about .5 tsp cinnamon in the crust.
Technique is big though! All dairy at room temp (aside from butter ;-) ) I used a water bath with the pan lined with foil and baked at 350 for 1.6 hours. Then i turned off the oven off. Propped the oven door open only slightly until the caked cooled to room temp and then refrigerated over night.
Made it again yesterday but with blueberry topping. So creamy, smooth and delicious!

Well, currently, I am giving this a middle-of-the-road 3 stars because I've not eaten any yet. It's currently cooling in the fridge. Longest. Wait. Ever. LOL However, upon taking it out of the oven, it looked great, so expect my rating/review to change later on tonight.

Update: This recipe is SO awesome. This came out better than any store bought cheesecake. Follow the recipe and keep an eye on it while it's baking and you will NOT be disappointed. 

It should be also noted that this is my first time even attempting a cheesecake... no-bake or otherwise.  The coloring came out perfect for me at 1 hour and 5 minutes at 350 degrees.

Followed the directions 99% only thing different is that I used a water bath halfway adding the water bath after it's been baking for 30 minutes . it was perfect after 1 hour. Thanks for this awesome recipe

I made this for Christmas 2017, when my sister was visiting, and it was amazing.  My kids (who said they didn't like cheesecake) devoured it and have been asking for it again.  They now rate commercial cheesecakes against this one - both times I've made this, it's been wonderful. I left off the canned pie filling topping - ick - fresh berries would be much better, but honestly nothing is needed!

I made this recipe to the letter with ONE smal tweak.  I added 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the graham cracker crust.  It added just enough extra crunch and was fabulous.  So good in fact one of my coworkers paid me to make two more!!!  So yes, I made it again and again it was a hit!

This is the first time I've made a REAL cheesecake. It was an easy recipe to follow and easy to make. I made mine sugar free with a sugar free chocolate graham cracker crust. I also added a little mint extract and sugar free chocolate chips. It turned out AMAZING! My son doesn't like cheesecake, but he liked this one. It was moist and crumbly like cheesecake should be. My husband is a diabetic and he couldn't tell it was sugar free. Needless to say it was a hit!! I'm looking forward to making the orange creamsicle cheesecake! Thank you for making the recipe easy to make. It was  well worth making.

I've made this recipe twice and both times I've found it way too eggy, almost like a custard. Not what I would call a cheesecake. It's edible, but look elsewhere for a cheesecake recipe.

Perfection. I cover mine with a traditional sauce of sour cream and sugar and strawberries. The cake itself mixes quick, bakes well, and someone scraped the crumbs from the pan. Definitely a win— I’m making it again a week later!

I have successfully made this cheesecake at least 20 times and is always a hit. I've made it with fresh strawberry ribbon and blueberry ribbons. It's the perfect simple dessert.

I made it once for a birthday, then had it requested for a baby shower. I ended up blending some fresh strawberries and folding them into whipped cream as a topping for the second one. It was a big hit!

Being the 1st time making this recipe, I followed it to a T.  It turned out perfectly! It was delicious, no air bubbles, no cracks. I did not use a water bath, didn't say to. Company happened in, they also raved about the cheesecake. They even asked if they could take some home with them, and they did. I used raspberries for fruit. I make my own jam, so I just thinned some out a bit, worked perfectly. Thanks for the recipe, it is perfect.

Made this cheese cake recipe and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again. Only problem I ran into was cracking. I read other reviews and baked at a slightly lower temperature.

Made this for Easter dessert! Cooked it in a water bath. Family LOVED it. The only changes I made were a little lemon juice in the batter and some extra crust. I did cook the crust for about 8 mins on its own. Great recipe!

Delicious!  Very creamy and light in texture.   The cake did brown very slightly around the edges, so I did some research and most recipes have a suggested temp. of 300 f. (next time I will lower the temp to avoid the browning)  I didn't have any cracking but the centre did sink in slightly but this was my fault for rushing the cooling period.     I made my own real cherry topping which turned out beautifully!  Over all I was pleased with my first attempt  but with a few adjustments to the temp and with keeping in mind that this cake can't be rushed ... I will have in both taste and presentation the most delicious Cherry Cheesecake!

Amazing! No substitutions for the cheesecake itself and my husband and brother-in-law raves about how good it is! Instead of cherries on top, however, I drizzled caramel, chocolate, and pecans for a turtle cheesecake!

I needed a dessert that was totally gluten-free, so the only change that I made was in the crust, which was made with ground almonds. Also a blueberry lemon sauce using cornstarch instead of flour. No cracks or over browning!  I followed reviews (thank you!) and covered the bottom with foil,did the water bath and baked it at 350 for 10 minutes,then 300 for the remainder...kept the oven door opened while it cooled.  It was delicious!  Note: don't expect a tall cheesecake,(which was fine cause it was very rich)  think about it...you're only using 3 blocks of cream cheese and one cup of sour cream...there are other recipes that almost double those ingredients if you wanted a tall cake.

Turned out fantastic. Everyone loved it!! I did bake in a water bath at 300. To the crust, I added in some nilla wafers and cut the sugar to about 1/8 cup.  So good, definitely a keeper!!

A 9 inch pie plate and a 9 inch springform pan are not the same size at all--a springform pan holds much more batter because it has much taller sides.  All the reviews saying there is too much batter are because they are not using the right pan.    If you don't have a springform you would have better luck using a 9x13 and then watching the cook time to adjust for the difference in batter thickness.

I made it without the topping.  Kids (5 and 6 years old) and I LOVE this recipe!  We agree that it tastes better than Cheesecake Factory.

This was my first time making cheesecake and I must say it turned out amazing! I used a 10in spring pan and cooked for 55 minutes at 350 but otherwise followed the original recipe. I made a strawberry topping to go with. It did turn out with a couple small cracks so I may try a waterbath next time. So easy and so decadent! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This isn't a super heavy and dense cheesecake, which makes it seem lighter.

Best.Cheesecake.Ever!
I followed the recipe completely other than using store brands rather than name brand products. It turned out fantastic. It was not a heavy, dense cheesecake. The texture as lighter and absolutely wonderful. All my family members decided this was their favorite cheesecake. Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out perfectly. I preheated the oven at 350 degrees. When the oven was ready I turned it down to 300 degrees, put the cheesecake inside and cooked it for 50 minutes. I left a crack in the oven and let it cool for 6 hours before refrigerating it.

This is my go to recipe for cheesecake! However I do tweak it a bit. I find that using 1/4 cup butter for the crust makes it more, crumbly and not so dense. I also only add 1 tsp vanilla, an 1 tsp lemon juice which adds more depth of favor. I also only bake for a half hour and turn off the oven then let the cake finish baking by slowly coming to room temperature while still in oven! Makes a perfect cake every time!!

I've made this a couple times. This time around, I made it with half neufchâtel, half cream cheese, and I didn't have quite enough sugar, so I subbed in about a quarter cup turbinado sugar. I didn't bother with the water bath, and it cracked, but it came out pale golden. I was able to eat a slice after only two hours of refrigeration, and it was heavenly. I didn't have any topping on it, just the cake. Very simple, delicious cheesecake.

This is extremely easy to make...it came out perfect, no crack, no water bath used....I baked it for 53 minutes and left it in the oven for 1 hour turned off to cool. perfect.... it's a very creamy texture. I'm going to try this recipe again with only 1/2 cup of sour cream to see if I can make the cheesecake not as creamy. The flavor is great!

It was a success but a lil eggy...maybe next time I'll use just 2 eggs instead of 3. Im also wondering if it's wrong to drop the batter couple of times to remove the air.... im not sure.. but my husband liked it so it's all good

This was awesome! I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was good plain, but I also bought some cherries in syrup (not pie filling with red #40), and it was good with that, too. The cheesecake cracked, but it was for family, and we didn't care.

Make sure when you make the filling that it’s not lumpy. Juat beat it for about 5 min. And it will be good.  Make sure you use a spring pan because then it will come out kf the pan very easily

Love this recipe! I don't use a springform pan though because I make cheesecake bites instead.  For the crust I sprinkle in ground cinnamon and nutmeg to "taste like Christmas". Like others said, cold ingredients need to be room temp, and let the cake cool in the oven when done. Delicious!

Simple cheesecake that has great taste and flavor. My family goes nuts every time I make it. Directions say 50 to 65 minutes but I find that 50-55 is perfect.  Served first one when it was still room temperature and had not been cooled. Was still good.

This recipe makes the perfect cheesecake. There was enough filling for one 7 inch springform pan and one 8 inch pie pan. The texture is thick but still light and fluffy, so it doesn't feel like you're eating a block of cheese, its flavor is so rich and delicate, it blends well with chocolate or fruit. I made this recipe as written except I didn't use pie filling on top, I wouldn't change a thing about this cheesecake, it's the only recipe I'll use from now on.

As a previous reviewer suggested I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and also added lemon zest. It was a hit. Many complements.

Simple and easy to make. I used a 10in pan instead of 9in, and I cooked it in a water bath at 300 degrees. I didn't have any cracked in it but I did have bubbles in the top. I later found out that you should not over mix the batter after you put the eggs in it because eggs hold air. I don't think I cooked it long enough because I was afraid to over cook it. I left it in the fridge over night but it's not s thick as I would like it. I tried to seperate the cake from the pan but messed up the top a little bit and topped with strawberries. I will try it again because it's so easy to make.

This turned out very light and fluffy.   Only change I made was to buy a premade graham cracker crust.  Wrapped in foil and  cooked in water bath and it turned out perfectly.

Best cheesecake recipe I have ever made! Easy too. Followed exact recipe except cooked in a 9 x 13 dish. 1 hr in a waterbath was perfect. Made for my son's birthday as cheesecake is his favorite dessert & he loved it! Served with fresh blueberries & a small side of blueberry sauce.

It browned very dark on top. Needed something. The taste was not what I was expecting.

I've never made cheesecake before and I'm not the best baker, but my friends said it was the best cheesecake they'd ever had! Very easy, I did use a water bath. It browned on top a little, but the mixed berry topping covered up the color. With the water bath and letting it cool in the oven with the door open, it didn't crack either. Delicious and highly recommend!

Followed the recipe exactly. Left it for two days in fridge (not on purpose). Decorated on top with canned cherry pie filling, plus fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. Looked great and tasted amazing! Everyone loved it!

Easy and tastes great! I made this lazy style and used 2 store bought 9-inch graham cracker crusts instead of making crust and using a springform pan. They needed about 40-45 minutes in the oven.

This was perfect.  The right amount of cream cheese vs. sweet.  Very simple too!  I made this for Christmas dessert and instead of cherries I just whipped whipped cream and melted caramels to drizzle over the top.  YUM!

We used as a birthday dessert for our son Christmas Eve. The consistency was perfect! I did use the eggs at room temperature and cream cheese softened to room temperature naturally. We blended thoroughly between each step and after each egg. This one will be saved as a family favorite!

I cooked the crust for about 10 minutes and let it cool for 15 minutes before putting the filling in.  It did take about 30 minutes longer to cook then written.

Love this recipe! I am always looking for great cheese cake recipes. I have found this one the best so far! I do have a good recipe  for a no bake, but I wanted a baked cheese cake. I have a digital oven which heats up pretty well and I found out that the 1 hour to 10 minutes was a bit much where I got a bit of  browning all around the edges and had a little more cracking in the center than I expected.  I did remedy the situation by trimming it, all the way around when it cooled. I made a strawberry glaze sauce with sugar and cornstarch and frozen strawberries.  I spread over the sides and strawberries on top ! All the flaws were hidden! Needless to say , everyone loved the cheese cake!

Wanted to do a practice run for Thanksgiving.   Very easy and excellent flavor.  Planning on making two for the holiday.  USed the water bath ... no cracks and no browning on top ...after refrigerating for 5 hour was perfectly firm and used a flat spatula to loosen from plate and slid it onto a serving plate.   Served  with homemade whipped cream and canned mixed berries.  This will definitely be made a lot ... planning to try a few changes ... crushed walnuts in the crust and would like a bit of citrus ...so many options ... very versatile!

n a one inch Springpan, ended up with a beautiful 3 inch cake.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I suspect it came out the way it is supposed to, but it is much too sweet and eggy and fluffy for my taste.

I made this it was very easy most ingredients already in the home. It was very good I will continue to make this recipe it did crack a little on the edges where I used parchment paper I didn't cut the parchment for a perfect round fit so I guess that's what I get.  I did use the water bath.  My crust was a little over done and dried out. So I will try it again without the parchment paper. I also used a 10inch springform pan so it was not as thick maybe 2.5 inches.  I will perfect the recipe during holidays. I usually buy from the Cheesecake factory however, theirs are all frozen and then thawed.  It's so great to be able to make my very own freshly made cheesecake!  Btw, I am going to try the ricotta and lemon zest next time and an extra egg yolk.

Took some to the neighbor and she asked for the recipe.  I would line the sides of the pan with Parchment paper.  I did spray with cooking spray.  I used President's Choice Greek Yogurt cream cheese and it was delicious.  Very easy.

After reading that some added ricotta and some added sour cream, I decided to add 1/2 cup of each. It turned out great!
