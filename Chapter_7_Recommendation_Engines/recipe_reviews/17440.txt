Excellent!  I couldn't wait to try it, so I didn't let it cool long enough though.  I suggest refrigerating an hour or so before eating.

This was EXTREMELY easy to make.  I did the dough in the KA stand mixer using the dough hook and then switched to the flat beater for the filling, using the same bowl.  I used Heart Smart Bisquick and reduced fat cream cheese, and this still was plenty tasty.  To make spreading the raspberry preserves easier, I briefly heated them in the micro and then poured it on the top of the cake.  For those reviewers commenting on the crust/dough, keep in mind that this is a coffee cake, not a cheesecake.

This was okay, but not what I was expecting.  The crust comes out like a shortbread or biscuit, crumbly and not very sweet.  The cheesecake filling topped with preserves was the best part.  I think I would have preferred just to make a cheesecake.

I didnt care for it at all, the cheesecake part was good, but the crust was bland, I ended up using bisquick mix since I couldnt find any buttermilk mix in the stores. What exactly is buttermilk baking mix anyway?

I loved this recipe!  It was SO good and SO easy.  I substituted the cream cheese for dairy-free cream cheese and it still came out well.  My mom even liked it and she usualy doesn't like things I make with 'fake' cheese.

I was disappointed with the heavy crust and the so-so filling.

Easy, but lacking in flavour. Rating this as a coffee cake, it's not at all similar to any I've had before. That said, this was pie-like in form (crust with filling)- there was too must crust to filling, which made this taste bland (though somewhat salty) and dry. I liked the concept of the dish, however it won't be a repeat.
