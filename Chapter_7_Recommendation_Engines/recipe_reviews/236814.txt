I made this tonight with rainbow trout and it turned out beautifully in the end.  I would recommend NOT using a glass dish, but to cook it in metal.  When we added the little bit of water to the pyrex dish (as instructed), the entire pyrex dish shattered in our oven.  I should have known better with water and glass, but trusted the recipe.  Thankfully, the fish was saved and we finished cooking it in a metal roasting pan.

and very flavorful!  I used a sheet pan lined with non-stick foil.  After basting with olive oil, I placed lemon slices in and on the trout.  After baking 10 minutes, I turned the trout over and baked for 10 minutes.  I did not add any water.  The result is delicious moist trout.  Enjoy!  Thank you.

I posted this recipe and was sorry to read someone shattered their pyrex dish adding water! I know what this is like as my hubby did the same once with a totally different dish. I had no problem because I added Hot water, which maybe I should have mentioned, but for safety reasons if you prefer a metal pan that's a good idea. Glad people are enjoying this.

Simple and delicious.  I used a mixture of fresh herbs from my garden which added flavor and lightness.  Onions, lemon, salt and pepper and you're done! 

The serving size seems wrong tho.  My husband and I can eat a fish apiece (he could probably eat more) so cannot imagine two fish feeding six people - even little munchkins!  I would allocate a fish per person for adults.

We used Pyrex baking dish, but when we added the water, it shattered the dish.  Use a metal pan.

excellent Rainbow Trout.!  just an FYI, all Pyrex is not alike.  The original Pyrex laboratory glass/kitchen glass was Boro-Silicate.  the same product now is soda glass.  it is not nearly as resilient in terms of hot/cold.

This is just what I was looking for. I use the same recipe when I grill trout. But the weather doesn't allow for grilling right now so it's good to know I can do this in the oven. I love the oven instructions and the trout came out tender and delicious.

Super easy, super delicious. My son caught rainbow trout yesterday morning before leaving our camping trip, and helped with preparing this recipe tonight. It was the perfect way to showcase his prize catch.

I did not use the whole trout but the recipe turned out just fine. About the dish, I learned from past experience and put the water in at the same time the fish is placed in the oven, alternatively, I boil water so the water and the pan are the same temperature; I prefer to either put the water in at the beginning or to use metal pan though.

Wanted to change up my trout dish, so I found this recipe and gave it a try. The only modification I made was to place the lemon slices inside the trout like it shows in the image. My family absolutely loved it and said it was very moist and flavorful. I did use a glass dish, taking care to add very hot water at 10 minutes into the bake, exactly per the author's instructions. Actually I was amazed at how moist it turned out given that it is baked uncovered.

I never cooked fresh trout before so wasn't sure how, but it turned out to be really easy and results were terrific! Even the twin 5 year old girls (freaked out by the WHOLE fish, eyes teeth and tail) ate their fill! It was moist, tasty and quick- everything you'd want in a weekday meal!

Followed the basic recipe, with some suggestions by other reviewers: stuffed the trout with sliced lemons and onions, added a little minced garlic.  Had little leftover chicken stock so used that instead of water. Doubled up on dill and omitted thyme for my taste.  Had my doubts about cooking time and temp. but it turned out marvelous.  Next time will line the baking pan with heavy duty foil to simplify cleanup.  And there will definitely be a next time!!!

My biggest problem with recipes on this site is that they don't include weight or measurements. We catch wild rainbow trout and they run from 8" to 20" We really need a cooking time per oz/lb. Otherwise, the recipe is great. Used limes because we didn't have lemons, but we had all the other fresh herbs and it was very good. But for all of you out there buying fish - check it while it is cooking because the time you cook it depends on the size of the fish you bought (or in our case caught)

Delicious, easy, and healthy.  Used fresh herbs and used filets Instead of whole fish, doubling to equal the thickness.

Used a French white dish, and it worked out fine when putting the water in the pan with rainbow trout the kids caught. Kept it simple with just what I had, the olive oil, dillweed and thyme, but instead of all the rest, I just used Lowry's Lemon pepper. Served with celery sticks and peanut butter... Splendid lunch.

VERY GOOD! I have a herb garden so used 1 tbsp fresh dill, lemon thyme & added parsley. Mixed 1/2tsp kosher salt & 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper with the herbs  and smothered the inside of the fish. Had 2 fresh trout (1lb). filleted by the market.  Never tried onion with trout before. Sliced 1/2 large onion super thin and  laid it in the fish then layered sliced meyer lemon on top.  Cooked per instruction in a 1/2 metal baking sheet sprayed with olive oil.  20 min sounds like a long time but it was perfect at 400degrees. Delicious! Loved the onion/lemon combination.  My 85 year old Mom who is not a fan of fish gobbled it up.   Thank u for this recipe!

Holy cow was that good.  I catch a lot of brown trout in local streams but don't usually keep them.  I'll be keeping more.  Usually my kids are big on fish but loved this.  Next time I think I'll cook it with potatoes.

I made this with 1 fresh rainbow trout from Metro (9.12$ cad). My husband and I were wary of the little bones but need not have worried. The tail, top fin and cheek meat were delicious too, but for presentation I cut through the head and tail with my spatula and served the body in 2 sections on beds of lettuce. I let the fish cook for 10 minutes at 400 with one fat slice of lemon on top, then added two tbsp of boiled water to the metal roasting pan. It really hissed!!! It was fine after and cooked for another 12 minutes. The eye swelled up so I tamped it down with foil, as the eye weirded me out. The herbs were yummy but very subtle. I used 1/4 tsp of salt, dried thyme and dried dill weed for 1 fish. I put oil inside the fish with the herbs, too. I will definitely make this again, and experiment with other herbs. Served it with couscous salad, tossed lettuce and tomatoes with feta, fried green beans in garlic, and sparkling water with lemon wedge.  In case anyone wants inspiration for sides.

No changes and I would make it again. 

It was much easier to remove the flesh from the bones after the trout cooked.

This was fantastic! I didn't have a lemon so I gave it a generous squeeze of lemon juice.

Oh, wow!  Best trout I've ever tasted.  Super moist and flavorful.  When it came time to add the  water, I added BOILING water to the baking dish with no problem.  I will definitely use this method of cooking trout again and again.

Absolutely phenomenal. But I added bacon around the trout and when it was done cooking, I took the bacon off and finished frying it, chopped it into bits, and then added it to my broccoli cheddar rice. Amazing!

this was so quick and easy. The fish was tender and delicious.
I loved making this dish and will again. Maybe next time zest the lemon and cut it into the salt dill and thyme for extra flavor inside and out.

I typically fry trout, but it was the kind of day that I didn't want to fry.  So, researched for trout recipes before deciding on this one ~ and, I am glad that I did.  Our trout, which hubby caught, was delicious prepared as the recipe say,  Preparation was easy... Thanks!

Very easy, and the only change I made was to put the lemon slices inside the trout.  Delicious, and I used the suggestion for the leftovers - mixing with mayo and mustard for a sandwich the next day.  I will surely make this again!

I have made this many times now. This is my go to recipe when we catch the big trout. I use a pyex baking dish and add the water at the beginning, then baste the fish one time while the fish are baking. This has become my favorite trout recipe! I have to adjust the baking time according to how big the fish are. Up to 30 min. Thank You for this wonderful recipe!

Quite tasty.  I used fresh trout that I had previously caught on a fishing trip.  The only thing I changed was adding minced garlic with the onion  to stuff the fish.  Very simple and tasty recipe.

I made this tonight and was delighted with the final result. It was so easy and so good. I really pretty much made it exactly as the recipe called I did squeeze the lemon on top of the fish and the placed the lemon slice inside for more flavor. We really enjoyed it and will be making it again.

This was my first time making Rainbow trout. I had fresh fillets, and so I decreased the baking time. I took others' suggestions and used a metal pan. I put the onion slices under the fillets and lemon slices on top. Turned out well, although I was left to desire more flavor. Overall, an awesome base formula for Rainbow Trout!

I made this twice. The first time I used dried herbs and the second time I used  two tablespoons each fresh dill and thyme.  I liked it much better with fresh herbs. I also squeezed fresh lemon juice inside the trout the second time around. The recipe  is a good one to begin with. Thanks for posting!

Super quick and easy recipe! I didn't have lemons so used lemon thyme from the garden. Thanks to reviews, I put the water in at the onset. Fish was delicious, made a big hit with the family!

Made this recipe tonight.  The trout was exceptional.  I love this recipe!  It had a wonderful flavor and was very moist.  I did make a couple of changes - used Olive Oil spray instead of the liquid olive oil - I think it covered the fish more evenly.  Couldn't find my dill, so I substituted Italian seasoning and Zesty Lemon.  Not really a substitute, but it was a nice variation on the dill flavor.  I sliced a whole lemon and put most of the lemon slices inside the fish, along with the onion slices.  Put four lemon slices on top of the fish for cooking.  I did use a metal pan, thanks to all the reviews that advised against using a glass one.  I did use hot water, though.  I recommend this recipe highly - I'll make it again.  We probably have 15 pounds of trout left in the freezer from last fall's fishing trip, so I'll have ample opportunity to repeat this dinner.  Served it with long grain & wild rice and a green salad.  Very nice!

I was looking for a fast and easy recipe for 2 whole rainbow trout and this is what popped up.  I was extremely happy with the ease and outcome of the fish.  I added a bit more extra spice and would add even more next time.  I did make the fish in a metal pan so I didn't have to deal with what others have dealt with.  I also put the lemon inside the trout along with the onion.  It was really good and next time I will make more than 2 trout for my family of four!  I served with rice and peas for a quick meal.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

The baking dish exploded all over the interior of the oven when the water was added.  Dish ruined - dinner ended.  Be sure to use heavy duty aluminum foil or an aluminum pan.  I think the recipe would be fine.

As an avid fisherman I love trout when I can catch it.  I loved this recipe, it helped me keep breaking through to my friends who always want to bread and fry anything that comes from the water. They absolutely enjoyed it and now ask me to cook it every time we get trout. Thanks!

A good standard recipe for trout. Nothing fancy here but totally solid.  A good canvas to add other ingredients  for added flavor.

So easy! Used a metal pan (thanks other reviewers!). Delicious!! I will make again. Only change - I used melted Kerry Gold butter instead of olive oil.

Really delicious flavour! So simple to make too! I used lemon juice in place of the lemon and fresh dill instead of dry.

Very easy to make, and very delicious to eat. Our trout was quite large, so added 10 minutes (5 before, and 5 after the water), and it was perfect.

This was a perfect change for me. I always buy the fillets and fry them...of course the whole fish cost much less but I didn't think frying would work out. This recipe was simple, easy, fast and delicious! I did have the store remove the heads (don't like 'em looking at me.). Thanks so much.

The fish was moist and yummy!
Not much flavor came from all the seasoning, just from the fish itself.
