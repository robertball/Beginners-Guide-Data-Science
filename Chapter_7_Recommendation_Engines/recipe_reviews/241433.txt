I don't have a bread machine but I didn't let that stop me from trying this yummy recipe. I just proofed the yeast in milk that I warmed to 110 in the microwave and proceeded from there. I did have to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough come together but probably wouldn't have had to with the bread machine. I did have some difficulty with the hazelnut leaking out of the buns but that could have been user error. Thanks for sharing your great recipe.
