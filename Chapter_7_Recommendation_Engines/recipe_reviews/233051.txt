The only thing that I did differently was to make the white sauce, then stirred in the peas, and let them heat up.  Canned peas are softer than frozen, and I was concerned I'd mash them while stirring to thicken the sauce.  This is like a reminder of my childhood because we had them often.  Enjoyed!

Super easy and just like I remember from childhood. I did add about an extra tablespoon and a half of butter. Will use this recipe often!
