Great recipe. Better than any shrimp and grits I have had restaurant or otherwise.  I followed the recipe as written.  I would leave th bread out.  It really didn't seem to be part of the recipe just more of a side.  I would reduce the butter next time and would probably use a smoked bacon instead of the maple cured.  It was a little sweet.  Also the only real purpose of the bacon was the grease to fry the shrimp although I wouldn't chnage that.  You could use the bacon for something else.   This was a HUGE hit.

The recipe was very good.  Like the other cook, I'd leave the bread out - grits are already a starch, why add more?  And instead of putting the bacon on the side, I crumbled it up and put it in the sauce.  I don't use garlic powder - only fresh garlic.  I put in 3 minced cloves.  I'll make this again and again.
