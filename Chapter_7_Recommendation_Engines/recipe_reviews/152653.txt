This recipe was fantastic.  Even my sometimes critical husband (who doesn't even really like fish) raved about it.  I did make some minor changes however.  I had no "spiced" tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes and sauted 3 cloves of garlic, 1 small onion finely chopped, and 1 small red pepper diced.  I added the saute mixture to the tomatoes and put ove r the Boursin mixture.  To all who want to save calories, spray baking dish with Pam and use a light herbed cream cheese (
Boursin is not necessary)!!! Will add to my regular rotation!

This might not have been much to look at in terms of plating and presentation but man, oh man, was this ever delicious. Because this dish had Boursin cheese in it, which Hubs hates but agreed to tolerate for me, I deliberately made a hearty pasta dish to go with, thinking that this fish dish was going to be a total bust. Wow, what a surprise - for both of us.  Best fish recipe I've made in awhile.  I had fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden so I used them in place of the canned tomatoes.  I sauteed some shallots and finely chopped green pepper, added some fresh minced garlic, then cooked that a bit before adding the fresh, diced tomatoes.  Since Hubs was so cooperative with the Boursin, I deliberately skipped the Parmesan, which he REALLY dislikes.  I didn't miss it.  The fish was flaky, tender and moist; the sauce to die for.  This was so good even Boursin Hating Hubs loved it! Served with Penne with Garlicky Broccolini, also from this site, this was just an excellent meal.

I loved this recipe- only changes I made were to use some happy cow cheese (garlic and herb flavor) and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  My husband loved it, will be a repeat dinner!

I think this is one of the best meals I have ever made.  I used light boursin and a tomato basil bruschetta topping.  Tasted like I slaved over it all day!

Very easy and yummy way to fix fish. Instead of Boursin, I used two wedges of Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb cheese, which was less fat but just as good. I also cut the butter down to 1 tbl. since it was just the two of us and I only had 1/2 lb. of fish. Excellent Valentine Meal!

Delicious!
 i made this 4 days ago and i am making it again...it is very tasty and super easy to make.
 I would recommend de drain de tomatoes pretty good in order to have a creamy sauce nd the end, the first time it was a bit watery. and I  put more parmesan on top so it would be nice and "gratinee".
 it is pretty fool proof! enjoy!

Easy and so very good.   I used haddock (much better than our cod) and first time tried Laughing Cow but much prefer Boursin.   As one reviewer suggested, I drained the tomatoes so the sauce would not be watery.   Will be making again and again.   Did not need to use butter at all.

I made this with swordfish steaks and it was awesome.  I hadn't used boursin cheese before and now that I have, I'll be using it in many other recipes.  This dish practically makes itself and really impresses.  Thank you!

Tasty.  I added saute' of thin slice bell pepper, onion and mushrooms (4-6 min), Can't help myself I added more garlic to the above.  I also made my own Boursin Cheese. Layered-fish, saute', Boursin, tomatoes, parm..  No butter drizzle.  Broiled 3-5min
Thank you for the new recipe!

Very tasty and quick to put together. When served with wine and appetizer, this dish presents like an expensive, gourmet meal that took time to make. Drawback:  Cheese and butter amounts make it not so heart healthy. I think next time I will choose a lighter cheese alternative, and use half the butter.

I give it a one because it was edible.  Soggy fish.  Just  bake your fish without the soggy stuff.

This was fantastic. The boursin chees was $8.00 for 5 oz. which I couldn't bring myself to buy, so I improvised and used Philadelphia cooking cream, the italian and herb, and my family loved it.

I made this recipe as written except I only made 2 servings.  Also, I only found tomatoes with roasted garlic and onion.  DH and I enjoyed it and I will most likely make it again.  The only problem I had was once the Boursin melted it tended to want to slide off of the top of the fish taking the tomatoes with it.  I decided to serve with thin spaghetti making a light sauce with the remaining tomatoes and reserved juice, extra garlic, a splash of white wine and a dollop of the Boursin.  All in all a pretty quick weeknight meal for us.

FANTASTIC! I didn't have any Boursin on hand, so I made some using 'Herbed Cheese Spread' from this site, which worked great! Also, I didn't have the type of diced tomatoes called for, so I took advice from naples34102 and sauteed some finely chopped green peppers, onions and garlic in a bit of evoo. When that was softened, I added a lightly drained can of petite diced tomatoes...worked perfectly! Hubby commented several times about how much he loved this dish and that I could make it as often as I would like, lol. Even the little guy liked it. This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was surprised that this was so good as Boursin cheese is not usually my thing. Someone had brought the cheese spread over for Xmas and there was extra so I searched for a recipe to use it up. Both myself and my husband agreed this dish was quite good. I made it exactly as written but used garlic powder on the fish.

This was wonderful.  I had gone to the store without my list and forgot the tomatoes.  I went on without them and it was still wonderful.

Great!  I did add a few I sauted mushrooms, green pepper, onion and garlic first. I added that to a can of tomatos. I put the fish in a pan, put gorganzola cheese on top, then veg mix on top of that, sprinkled some spike over it all covered and cooked for 20 minutes it was delicious!  My s.o. couldnt believe it was fish!

excellent recipe, just had to substitute the boursin for a herb and garlic spread (didnt have boursin). drained the tomatoes as suggested. no butter needed! loved it! going to be repeated often, as is very easy to make and really gives a twist to cod. served it with linguini tossed with butter and the remaining tomatoes. delish!!!!

This was a very easy recipe and the results was quite tasty.  I found that the boursin herb cheese was already quite salty so there was no need to add additional salt.  A hit with the family.

Excellent recipe - I used Light Alloutte spread, added tomato sauce (one can of diced tomatos didn't seem enough but that's all I had so I added half a jar of roasted garlic tomato sauce), added a bag of baby spinach btwn the cheese and tomatos - next time I'll put the fish on top of the bed of fresh spinach instead to give the sauce and cheese more time to meld together.  Served over rotini with the extra sauce from the baking dish along side roasted asparagus.  Delish!

I used this idea on tilapia because dd prefers it to cod. Fresh  diced tomato with sliced onions and garlic instead. Homemade version of "Boursin on a Budget" by covergirl. Served over lemon basil flavored cauliflower "rice".

This fish recipe is SO good.  Seriously delicious.  The boursin herb cheese makes it creamy, and the butter and parmesean cheese make a nice, rich crust.  I loved this fish!

This was a massive hit in my house. I didn't measure a thing. I just put some butter, didn't even bother melting it, in a dish. placed the cod over the top. I crumbled two packs of boursin over the top. I used a tin of chopped tomatoes with herbs then sprinkled some parmesan on top of that. I must admit I also crumbled some cheddar on top as well because it needed using up. I served it with a green salad and they all want it again tomorrow. Thanks

Prepared as directed, no changes.  Found it to be very bland.  If I prepare it again, I will season the fish itself prior to topping or possibly marinate it in a zesty italian to perk it up a bit.  And reaaly Cathy D, how can you rate something you haven't tried?

Very nice with some lovely little mahi mahi filets.  I used Happy Cow garlic and herb to cut down on calories and it was really good.  The only other change I made was to saute and add a cup or so of fresh mushrooms to the tomato mixture.   This is one of those rare recipes that is convincing my normally fussy husband that he does indeed like fish.

Excellent - we make this frequently.  We use a high quality bottled pasta sauce instead of the canned diced tomatoes.  Super quick and easy.

We really enjoyed this.  My husband is not really a fan of fish, but he thought this was good.  I used basil, oregano, and garlic tomatoes instead of what was called for and a pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan.  Will definitely make this again sometime!

Very good.  I followed the suggestion to drain the tomatoes extra well; be careful doing that not to remove too much of the liquid, the fish will be dry.  Used 1 lb. cod, but the remaining ingredients stayed the same which I would not change.  I sprinkled a little panko over all for some crunch.  Next time I might add some olives or capers and maybe a little white wine.  I will definitely make this again.  For those who don't want the expense of buying Boursin, there are several good recipes online to make your own which is what I did.  Made the one by Paula Deen using whipped butter.

Really easy and very tasty. Used chive and onion cream cheese and sprayed the dish with pam instead of butter.  Sprinkled a little bit of Cavender's on top.  Will definitely make again.

Just made this. Fantastic!! I didn't want to spend $7 on a small tin of Boursin so I mixed some dried herbs into some leftover cream cheese.  Tastes EXACTLY the same.   My husband loved it.  This is a keeper.

The sauce was delicious, but would prefer the fish breaded.  My family didn't care much for the "fishy" texture.  Go figure!  Used cream cheese instead of the Boursin.

Well this was a hit for us last night!  I skipped the butter altogether and just sprayed my pan with vegetable cooking spray.  I subbed tilapia for the cod and since I was making just two servings, I used an entire can of Rotel, well drained, but I reserved the juice.  The Rotel gave this a nice kick.  As previously suggested I used Herb Cheese Spread by lutzflcat, also on this site, for the Boursin cheese.  I prepped this early in the afternoon, spreading the cheese spread thinly, covered and refrigerated until time to bake.  I uncovered it, topped with tomatoes, salt and pepper, and just a little of the reserved juice to remoisten the tomatoes a little, and lastly the Parmesan.    At this point I was going to drizzle a little butter over the top as indicated, but I forgot.  My tilapia was much smaller than the amount listed in the recipe, so mine was perfectly cooked in 20 minutes.  The only changes I would make next time would be to slightly increase the cheese spread (I was pretty skimpy with it this time), and I will try to remember the drizzle of butter over the top.  This was very nice and Hubs said it’s a do over for sure!

We really enjoyed this recipe, although the kids were not too thrilled. I did not have the diced tomatoes with onions, so I just added a diced shallot and a few minced garlic cloves.  I also did not have the Parmesan, so I sprinkled some feta on top that I happened to have on hand.  I served it over brown rice and completed with green veggies.  Will make again!

I'm not a huge fan of fish but I'm always trying new ways to work it into my diet. This is an excellent start but made as per the recipe was very bland. It needs work. This is a 2 for just as the recipe stands. I need to try this one a few more times and figure out how to make it taste better.

Y'all!  Shut the front door! This is perfect, PERFECT!  I'm in a small town, so had to sub Laughing Cow Swiss with garlic and herbs as the cheese, but it turned out delish.  My Portuguese husband, who thinks cod must be soaked overnight, ate the entire thing almost single handedly (I used thawed cod fillets)!!

The cheese added a fantastic flavor to the fish.  My husband couldn't stop raving about the recipe.  The only "change" I did was microwave the cheese for 20 seconds because I didn't have time to let the cheese get to room temperature.  It was delicious!

This was delicious. I'm normally not a fish lover but I saw this recipe under the reviews and I was very anxious to try it. With just a  few simple ingredients it looked and tasted like I spent hours on dinner when I didn't. I served it with Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce and baked potatoes. There was nothing left on my plate.

This is EXCELLENT.  I was looking for a new way of cooking COD and found this.  Unfortunately I did not Boursin so improvised by using a small log of goat cheese to which I added several spices.  Did not wish to use canned tomatoes so chopped up 2 small Campari tomatoes, a handful of spinach and several fresh basil leaves instead.  Followed everything else as stated and it was ABSOLUTLY delicious.

I wasn't sure how this was going to come out - I thought the cheese would melt and slide off the fish, but it didn't! yay! We used Laughing Cow garlic & herb in place of the Boursin. Also, I mistakenly purchased diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano & basil. Still t was so delicious! Even my extra picky 8-yr old loved it. She said it tasted like pizza - it kind of did - if pizza was awesome fish!

Very good. The kids and husband hated it but they hate any fish that isn't battered and deep fried so I didn't expect anything different from them. I enjoyed it a lot. I made mine with Tilapia on a bed of spinach and used the light Boursin. I also served it with light pasta. I thought it was delish.

I exchanged the Boursin with Crumbled Gargonzola and the Parmesan with Ramano and used orange peppers for contrast, It was great and did not turn down a second helping.

This was soooo good. I would give it 10 stars if I could.  It was very easy to make too.  I used flounder. I figured an light white fish would work and it was on sale. I also just crumbled the cold cheese over the whole thing. This will be regular dinner for us. GREAT WORK NIGHT MEAL.

This was great! It was super easy and delicious. I used Tilapia and sprinkled the Boursin on to save on calories. I didn't use butter, I just sprayed the pan with Pam. It cooked in about 11 minutes. Thanks!

What an excellent recipe!  I used Orange Roughy because it is my favorite white fish and it was on sale.  To make it a little healthier I used olive oil instead of butter and Laughing Cow cheese in garlic and herb flavor.  It was so easy – one little wedge for each fillet!  I couldn’t find the tomatoes listed in the recipe, so I used Italian-style diced tomatoes (with garlic and spices).  Such a delicious and simple recipe, I highly recommend this and will definitely make this again!

This is very tasty.  I had no Boursin on hand so I combined up some cream cheese with fresh garlic with fresh herbs.  Also- only had plain canned chopped tomatoes so I added some minced onion and green pepper to it.  I seasoned my fish with the salt and pepper BEFORE adding the toppings as well.  The cheese and canned tomatoes have a lot of salt already and I thought it was better to season the actual fish first.  FYI - A LOT of liquid is released when these bake.

So easy and delicious. Any garlic herb spreadable cheese should do the trick. I used Pub garlic and herb cheese with canned diced tomatoes. As written, it provides a gourmet taste and makes for a lovely dinner.

This recipe is indeed very good! I made half of it and it was perfect. I served it with Lemon Cilantro rice from this site and it was just excellent pairing! Will make it again. You can prep it a few hours in advance and pop it in the oven. My only suggestion would be to still melt the butter and pour it over the parchment paper if you go that route. I will still could potentially stick if you do not use butter on the parchment paper. Other than that this recipe is excellent....

I think this recipe is probably really good, but maybe I don’t like cod.  I’ll have to try it with tilapia or some other white fish.

This recipe was amazing!!! The fish was tender and flaky and the topping was very rich and flavorful. I didn’t have canned tomatoes on hand. So I diced a tomato, half an onion and sautéed it in butter with some prepared garlic in the squeeze bottle and let  that be my topping and it was out of this world. Husband told me I can make this anytime!!!

This recipe is great and flavorful, Incredibly easy to make as well! I switched cheese to garlic and herb spread and used diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions, then added some red pepper flakes. Will definitely make again.

We call this "Pizza Fish" at home.  I've made it a few times and every time it turns out excellent.  Of course I add way more parmesan cheese than the recipe calls for.

This is a wonderful easy recipe!  My husband is anti-fish except for salmon however he does like haddock chowder. I used haddock instead of cod and made my own tomato/onion/garlic topping with the Alouette garlic herb cheese. It was heavenly!  Hubby loved it and asked me to make it again.  Thank you for this lovely recipe!  He thinks it would also be good made with veal. ;)

I made this last night, it was wonderful. Didn't have green pepper in tomatoes but worked just a good.  A beginning cook will find it easy.  Made some rice and stirred the juices and tomato from the baking dish into the rice along with juice I had saved when I drained the tomatoes. Perfect Easy dinner.

We loved this recipe!  I used cod and diced roasted tomatoes with garlic (I couldn't find diced tomatoes with garlic , onion and peppers) along with Boursin and parmesan.  It was fantastic-a regular dish for us.  I omitted the butter to cut on the fat and didn't miss it.

I will definitely make this again, although I used haddock instead of cod -- very similar.  It's a little rich But very tasty. I used a can of diced tomatoes. Easy and quick.

Enjoyed it and appreciated an excuse to have Boursain  cheese in my home  and it isn't a holiday.  Luckily I had leftovers from making the Roasted Cherry Tomatoes with Angel Hair pasta from this site.  It sure beat canned diced tomatoes.    Served it with steamed green beans and roasted garlic potatoes.

I will definitely make this tasty dish again. The Boursin cheese is salty so I didn’t add any additional salt. The next time, I’ll use Rotini tomatoes with chilies because a little spice will add to the flavor. Super easy and tasty!

A really easy meal to get on the table and quite good. But cod is not cheap and neither is the cheese so this wasn't an inexpensive meal either.  I didn't really care for the consistency of the cheese.  I'd have to find another kind of cheese if I make this again.  Perhaps the Laughing Cow brand is better.  But otherwise, it was good enough to try it again for sure.

This was delish.  I used canned tomatoes with jalapeno peppers and added my own onion and green pepper.  Next time I'll use vegetables from my garden.  I'll make again soon.  It's an easy recipe to make a couple of hours ahead and then bake later.

I would have given this a 3 but then I ate the leftovers on night two.  The flavors blended wonderfully on night two.  I'll be making this recipe again.  Simple and open to experimental variation.

I had been in the hospital for a week and dreaming if this recipe. To be on the safe side (dairy can get to me) my son ans I made it without the cheese. Used all the other ingredients and it was amazing! Lite and delicious. Cant wait to make it again!

This was delicious.  I used low fat Allouette cheese.  Rather than canned tomatoes, I chopped up a tomato and 2 green onions.  I sautéed them with chopped garlic and a little olive oil before putting them on top.  Used spray rather than butter.  Followed the rest of the recipe.  Our cod did not take 40 minutes to cook but rather 25 minutes.

I hate it when users change the recipe however! I am eliminating sugar from my diet and most canned foods contain added sugar. I used fresh tomatoes, onions and garlic sautéed. This was absolutely delicious and so easy even though we didn’t use canned tomatoes. A keeper!

Yes, I used fresh tomatoes & garlic, salt & pepper
on top off the boursin cheese.  Then put the melted
butter over the top  That way I had a healthy dish.

This is especially good and easy.  I made the sauce with green pepper, onion and garlic and a can of diced tomatoes sauteed about 8 minutes.  Didn't have Boursin so I used cream cheese.  I think most any cheese would work but I will try mozzarella next time even tho the cream cheese was delicious.  Added just a hint of other spices like chili powder and celery salt .  The fish had an excellent flavor, it was moist and looked attractive on the plate.  I'm adding this to my 5 Star recipe book to be made again and again.

While the topping was tasty - it completely overshadowed the fish.  If you are making fish for non fish lovers - this would do the trick.  I might make the topping again, but use it on chicken cutlets instead...

I had 1.5 lb of cod, 5 oz (standard pack size of boursin), 14.5 oz can of Muir Glen season diced tomatoes.  My older son is on a health kick and wants to add fish beyond salmon to his diet.  I love cod, but I grew up eating it, so I understand I have a challenge making him like it without ketchup.  As a cod lover, I thought this recipe was good.  The only enhancement I made was to add basil (a right, refreshing choice).  There was barely enough boursin to coat the chicken, and the cod really does need to buried in tomatoes, so I suggest 2 cans.  I might make this again - I think my husband would like it - but anything a 20 year old feel compelled to add ketchup to just doesn't work.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I made a few changes, because my husband and I like more spice in our food. I put chopped fresh basil on the Boursin cheese, used fire roasted tomatoes (drained), and added red pepper flakes. We loved this baked cod and will definitely make it again.

This was really good.  I added some chopped olives just for some color and texture.  My guest was really impressed.  I will definitely make again.   I made it once with Rotel (mild) tomatoes with green chilis.  Really good

This was so simple to make and SO tasty!  We are trying to add more fish to our dinner rotation and this one was a keeper.  I salt and peppered the fish rather than after adding tomatoes and used fire roasted canned tomatoes.  I forgot to drizzle with butter and didn't have Parmesan so skipped it but didn't miss either.  Happy accident to cut down on calories we didn't miss.  Loved all the great flavors -- definitely making this again!

I made my own boursin cheese, used tomatoes with onion and added my own basil and garlic - TO DIE FOR!!!!!!
The only regret is that I didn't make more!
Will definitely be on my first choice fish recipe rotation!
YUM!

Surprisingly delicious! I didn't have a good size baking dish, so I sauteed it. Added bread crumbs, sauteed on one side for 3 mns while basting with olive oil instead of butter. Then turned the cod over, poured on the cheese and the tomatoes, and cooked it covered for a few more minutes. I don't know how I'll be able to eat fish plain again! I totally forgot the parm cheese but it didn't matter :-)

I also didn't have the Boursin cheese, I used olive oil, cream cheese, italian seasonings, garlic powder and pepper.

I have made this recipe 10+ times and every time my fiancé is amazed he likes it so much.  I myself was unsure about cheese with fish but this is amazing.  I usually do not have seasoned tomatoes on hand so just add salt, pepper and garlic to plain diced tomatoes and it still turns out great.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Cut the recipe to 1/4th for just the 2 of us. Used one of those individually frozen, 4 packs of cod....so only used 2 pieces (1/2 lb). It was absolutely fantastic! Served with Basmatti rice cooked in veggie broth and butter and a garden salad. Will definitely become a favourite and I can't wait to make it for friends and family.

I made a few changes.  I used olive oil instead of butter, goat cheese in place of Boursin because that is what I had on hand.  Also added some bread crumbs and fresh thyme.

Quite a nice mixture of flavors.  Fish was done perfectly and the toppings were smooth and tastefully.  The thing I really missed the most, however, was the lack of nutrition information supplied.  There is none.  I can only assume that it was low in fat and carbohydrates and high in fiber.

The cod was moist and delicious. Tasted almost like lobster! I used olive oil instead of butter, Boursin cheese, and canned crushed tomatoes in basil (no onions or pepper). Preparation was easy and fast.

This was delicious! I forgot to pick up parm cheese but was not disappointed. The boursin cheese was $3.99 and lasted for two pounds of alaskan cod. I opted to add rotel for diced tomatoes. I aldo seasoned with emerils fiah rub, onion powder and threw in a forth of a garlic clove. It paired very nice with my fav veggie, brussel sprouts! Will make again! Thank you!!

This was a nice dish that agreed with everyone at the dinner table, but did not have any "wow."  I read a lot of the reviews and ended up using the laughing cow cheese.  Next time I will try the recipe with the boursin and spice it up with some red pepper flakes.

I just made this tonight and I loved it!  It is quick, easy and delicious!  The only changes I made were that I used fresh haddock because the store didn't have any cod today and I used just over half of a can of Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes with garlic.  I spooned the tomatoes out so it wasn't too watery.  I used the garlic & herb Boursin but I think next time I may try the red pepper Boursin for a bit of a kick! Also, it was a bit on the salty side so next time I won't add any before serving.  I served this with a green salad and couscous.

A great dish I have served to company a few times and it was enjoyed by all.  Wonderful combination of flavours.  It is lovely with cod but I have also made it with flattened chicken breasts.  You can lighten it a bit by using Low Fat Boursin or even substituting light herb & garlic cream cheese.  I use fire-roasted canned tomatoes.

Both my husband and I REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  I would not change a thing about it.  I actually forgot the parmesan cheese, and didn't even notice it missing.  I guess I wouldn't use it in the future to save a couple calories.

I loved this dish.  I've used Boursin in a recipe before and it never fails to add a unique flavor.  Together with the tomatoes it was superb.

What a unique flavor. I loved it. I followed the recipe but used only 2 pieces of cod. I kind of skimped on the Boursin because I didn't want to over do it. I wasn't using 2 pounds of fish. I recommend using all the Boursin no matter how much fish you are using. I used tomatoes with garlic and oregano. 25 minutes was to long. It was done around the 10 minute mark. I will be making this often. =)

This is a wonderful dish and so easy to prepare.  I used Allouette herbed cheese spread rather than Boursin and it was superb.  I've used the canned diced tomatoes which were really good, but if you have time try halved cherry tomatoes that are first sauteed with minced garlic and bell peppers, then layered on top of the cheese spread....excellent!!!
