They came out well but I did make some adjustments. I upped the flour to 3/4 a cup and only used 1 cup of walnuts. 2 cups of walnuts would have been like having a little cookie with my nuts.

Easy rich cookie! I tried this recipe twice once with 1/2 c flour once with 3/4 c and thought it was better (less dry) with 1/2 c. Semi-sweet and white chips make a great addition to the recipe.
