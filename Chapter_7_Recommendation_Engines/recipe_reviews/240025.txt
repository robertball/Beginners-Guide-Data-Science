Easy to make, smells great, tastes even better. Cut the parsnips into the size of the halved brussels sprouts (or slightly smaller, so they'll all get done at the same time). I added another white onion, and the two onions caramelized quite nicely. I used convection, so everything cooked perfectly at only 35 minutes. I used about 2 T of fresh thyme as I had extra, and that was great. It wasn't overpowering as thyme is mild to begin with. I made my own balsamic vinaigrette from scratch (whisk together: 4 T EVOO, 2 T balsamic vinegar, a chopped garlic glove, salt/pepper). Don't forget the brown sugar as that helped a lot with the caramelization and that perfect "burn." It took only 2 of us adults to finish the dish. Would lick the plate again!

I baked these for 80 minutes and parsnips weren't soft until I microwaved them to reheat the next day. It was alright then, but not enough to make it again.

Loved it!  Doubled the sauce and pre-cooked a pound of baby carrots and added those.  The carrots really added to the volume so it all went into two baking dishes.  Stirred the veggies every 10 minutes or so.  Yummy!

Amazing! Cut the parsnips in coins and made my own balsamic vinaigrette. Such a nice combo. Mild and delicious.
