I have been making this for years and I have found you don't need the foil. I usually put the zucchini strips in a ziploc, add olive oil, and season with salt, pepper and usually some cayenne.

Then just put them directly on the grill. They are even better if they get a little "burnt" looking.

Not sure why the name of this recipe is Grilled Zucchini. It's steamed zucchini but done on a grill instead of in a pot. Blah! The best way to make grilled zucchini is to cut them in half lengthwise, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then, just toss them on the grill flat side down for about 5-10 mins and then flip over for a few more mins depending on the size and thickness of your zucchinis. You'll get the nice grill marks, a juicy, sweet, soft yet crispy veggie. Now that's grilled zucchini!

An easy way to cook up a side dish to go along with all the BBQ meats.  Instead of butter, however, I sprayed the zucchinis with olive oil and added fresh herbs on top of the S&P.

I scored the zucchini first then drizzled it with olive oil instead of butter and in addition to the salt and pepper added some garlic powder and italian seasoning.  I didn't do a foil packet, just put it directly on the grill.  In no time at all, it was tender-crisp and delicious!  A perfect side dish for grilled chicken.

Tasty but mushy.  I used cooking spray instead of butter.  I added fresh chopped italian parsley in addition to the oregano.  I also added vidalia onion.  It was okay - would have grilled the zucchini rather than wrapping it in foil & steaming.

This recipe turned out OK, but the zucchini was soggy and not "grilled" (i.e. crispy) at all. Were I to try this again, I would probably remove the foil half way through and finish it directly on the grill and baste a little more butter.

Wrapping in foil steams veggies.  Direct grilling is best. And not much oil needed or turns mushy.  Zucchini grilled this way is delicious tossed with pasta.

I prefer to use olive oil instead of butter and I take it out of the foil for the last 5 mins and let it just sit on the grill. It makes it a little crisper and darker in color. Also, we like to add a little sliver of velveeta cheese right at the end of grilling until it melts.....DELICIOUS!

4 stars as written, but 5 stars with changes.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and sprinkled the zucchini with garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  Omitted the foil, and grilled directly on the grill.  Absolutely unbelievable flavor!

Unfortunately, the picture shows zucchini with grill marks, but the recipe merely steams them.  You can do this just as easily in a microwave.  This is not grilling.

We do zucchini like this often in the summer - it's so versatile and healthy (and oh so good!)  I usually just drop a bit of olive oil on the spears and then brush it on, season to taste with salt and pepper and then change my spice additions depending on what we are eating it with!  So easy to switch it up - spicy, savoury, earthy, mmmm, so many things you can do!

I make this all the time, it definitely needs to be put directly on the grill. It adds a wonderful flavor. I also use olive oil instead of butter.

I think it needs a few shakes of Italian seasoning and maybe some garlic for flavor, but I liked it - I prefer simple zucchini recipes like this one.  I cook mine closer to ten minutes than fifteen as I still like some texture to them.  I liked this, but prefer drizzling with olive oil and seasoning with salt and a garlic pepper herb blend I have and not wrappingthem in foil, but placing them directly on the grill.  I like the grill marks and being better able to judge when the squash is done to my liking.

I omit the foil as that just steams the squash. I "Grill" zukes all the time all year round. Slice squash into thick slices and brush lightly with olive oil and place directly on the grill, turn occasionally so they don't burn and brush again so they don't dry out, Season with sea salt, pepper and garlic powder. - Enjoy - I only gave this recipe 3 stars as it really isn't a grilling recipe more like steaming.

I didn't love this recipe, the zucchini turned out steamed and mushy, not grilled. I also think more seasoning is needed.

Like other reviewers, this is not "grilled" zucchini.  It is also not "healthy" like in the description.  You can simply use Olive Oil or Coconut Oil.  I also season mine with garlic powder and lemon juice.  I really don't think you need a recipe for this, as it's pretty much a trial and error session, tweaked until it's just to your liking.

This is such a refreshing way to have vegetables during the summer time.  I added summer squash to the zucchini and  instead of using butter, sprayed some cooking spray on top.  It was really good. Definately will be making this again.

I wouldn't put the zucchini in foil. We slice it length wise, sprinkle it with whatever flavor of Mrs. Dash sounds good with the main dish and grill it. I usually have some fresh Rosemary growing in my herb garden and throw that on top of whatever veggies I'm grilling. Zucchini with green onions and bell peppers are an amazing side with grilled chicken, steak or salmon. Yum! Skip the fat in the butter or olive oil - as long as your grill is well-seasoned, it will be fine!

I liked it, but as others have stated, this is not "grilled." I get a kick out of some of these reviews. "I tried this recipe, but instead of zucchini I used beer, and instead of cooking it I drank it, wasn't a fan." If you didn't try THIS RECIPE, don't rate it!

They came out pretty mushy but tasted good anyways.  I used oregano in addition.  I'll try direct grilling next time.

My kids ate these, which says a lot! I'll have to adjust grilling time next time I make, some came out mushy, others came out wonderful! Very yummy! Nice change from other veggies with dinner.
