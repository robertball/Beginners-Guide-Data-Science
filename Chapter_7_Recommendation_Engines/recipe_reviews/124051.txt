These muffins were soooo amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a touch of half & half to the mixture because the batter was too thick, and a 1/2 tsp extra of baking powder as suggested by other users. The muffins were light and perfect. I will totally be making these again. I think my husband has already consumed about 7 in less than an hour. LOl.

I had to adjust this recipe just a touch to reflect what I had on hand and to save money. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar back to a scant half cup, used a teaspoon each of baking powder/baking soda (for me, using a teaspoon of each gives me the best results), and I cut the butter back by half and used a quarter cup of buttermilk. For the peaches, I used a can and a half of no-sugar diced canned peaches. Out of one recipe, I got 12 regular muffins and 9 mini-muffins. These turned out REALLY wet. Like REALLY wet. Like inedible. Even after I pat dry the peaches. Not impressed. I want to say that it's operator error but I make a minimum of three muffin recipes a week. I won't make these again to find out.

Many of the reviewers that gave this recipe 5 stars had to add baking powder and liquid like I did. If I have to *fix* a recipe in order to make it work, I can't give it a great rating. Sorry. My batter was so dry I could have made scones with it. I ended up with very good muffins after making changes. Thanks!

These were so delicious I kept the oven on and turned around and made another batch! I followed the suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp of baking soda and a little milk to thin it out and they were nice and fluffy. No need for butter on these babies, they are sweet and moist, moist, moist! Fabulous recipe, everyone LOVED them! A great way to use a free on hand ingredients and by the way, I also used the frozen peaches and they worked great. :) Thanks again!

WOW! These are so good! I doubled the recipe and it's a good thing I did.  I ate 4 of these before anyone had found out I made them! :)  I didn't have pecans, but I did have chopped almonds. I used 1/2 of what the recipe called for because it was all I had.  Next time I'll use a whole cup!  I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon.  I took advice of others and added 1/2 tsp baking soda and a little milk.  Oh, yum, yum, yum!!

**I've made these several times now.  If I could give them 10 STARS I would!! These are so amazing!  I just thought I'd note that when I haven't had yogurt on hand, I have subbed sour cream for the same results.  We LOVE these amazing, delicious, moist muffins!**

Our whole family loved these muffins.  I made a batch last night and they were all gone by 10 AM this morning.  They definitely live up to the name.  They were very moist and fluffy and had a nice flavor.  I had to make them in a convection toaster oven since our oven is on the fritz and they still turned out great.  The pecans definitely went well with the peach and vanilla flavors.  Kudos for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly with fresh peaches, and went ahead and filled the muffin cups almost to the top because another reviewer said they didn't rise much. They ended up picture-perfect and sooo tasty. The texture and flavor are just perfect!

No idea what people are complaining about with the batter being too dry, or too moist. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had no baking powder so I used 1/2 tsp baking soda instead and hoped that the acidity of the peaches and the yogurt would make up for it. I may have also used more peaches (I don't know, I didn't measure) and mushed them around a bit, but my peaches were not going to last any longer. They have perfect little peaks and smell heavenly, like peaches and cream.

I did what some of the other viewers mentioned and added 1/2 tsp baking soda and a little milk as the batter was pretty thick. I used canned peaches and omitted the nuts. These turned out great! They are nice and moist and my family loves them. I will definately be making these again! Thanks

FANTASTIC! Mine we not cakey at all. I added a bit of milk to thin out the batter a bit, and since some said they did not rise a whole lot I added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. They turned out so fluffy and light and tasted like HEAVEN! Thanks!!

Yum! We are getting ready to move, so I was looking for a muffin I could make with the dwindling contents of my pantry. I used canned peaches, peach yogurt and wheat germ instead of the nuts. Very tasty!

Very good Muffins!! I substituted honey for the sugar and also added some cinnamon to the mixture.  I also put a little mixture of sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it on top of the muffins before putting them in the oven.  I will definitely make these again!

These are really good! Great alternative to blueberry.  Followed the recipe except for a few changes, replaced 1/2 c of AP flour with 1/2 c whole wheat, added 1/2 t of salt to dry ingredients (was afraid it would be too bland without) and used sour cream instead of yogurt cause I didn't have any.  Will definitely be making these again!

LOVED these.  Only 2 changes - added a little milk, added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  This recipe was perfect to use up some peaches that really were not all that great. My hubby usually does not eat muffins that well or peaches for that matter, but he adored these! So, so good.
Made these a 2nd time, forgetting changes I made 1st time!  Did not add baking soda or milk but exchanged walnuts for pecans b/c I had a lot of walnuts to use. Also used 1 c AP flour and 1/2 c WW flour to make them a little healthier.  Got 14 muffins this way.

Just made these....similar to a cake recipe I have.  Love that there is no oil in this recipe.  The only change I made was to add the extra 1/2tsp of baking powder and I added cinnamon.  I used very ripe fresh peaches and once incorporated into the thick batter, it did loosen up....no additional liquid is required.  It's a keeper!

let me just say I only used a few tablespoons of peach yogurt (it was all I had left) and used fat free half and half to make up  the difference. I also added a pretty thick layer of cinnamon sugar on top before baking and I kept the amount of baking soda the same as what's called for in the recipe, I'm not sure why everyone thinks its so important to increase the amount, mine rose just fine and came out of the oven light, fluffy and delicious. They were almost like cupcakes (maybe because I didn't have the full amount of yogurt?) They were mushy around the larger chunks of peaches but the smaller chunks were fine. Let these cool for about 5 or 10 minutes in your pan though so they don't fall apart when you take them out, I took a few of mine out too soon and they ended up a little disfigured.  I look forward to using this recipe, with all half and half, as a base recipe for my muffins and possibly even cupcakes! Thanks for sharing

I'm making these for the second time (currently baking in the oven). The first time they came out great with the couple of suggestions taken from previous reviews (which is why I can't give this five stars as written). I added an extra 1/2 tsp baking powder and added a little skim milk to thin out the batter. I also used closer to 2 cups of chopped peaches. They came out super moist and yummy, yet they were still missing something, so I added an almond glaze which just put them over the top. The batch that is in the oven now, I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients, which I expect will only enhance this recipe. A great way to use up some of the many peaches I have growing in my backyard!

These were good. The texture was great, but I thought the muffin batter tasted a little bland with just vanilla extract: maybe the pecans/peaches/yogurt drowned it out? In the future I'd probably add some baking spices and/or more vanilla to play off the peaches and pecans. I love baking cakes/cobblers with peaches but thought the pieces in these muffins got a little "mushy". Thanks for sharing.

They were so flufy and puffed up perfectly! But I wasn't much of one for the peachy flavor. I'll try this again subbing a little milk for the peaches and adding some spices or choclate chips.  But i would still call them a sucess, just not my faves.

I thought it was rather good. I drizzled the tops with confectioner sugar and some of the juice left from the peaches.

Delicious!  The batter was very thick, but they turned out good.  They are a dense muffin, but they have a great flavor, especially if you use peach yogurt.  I skipped the nuts.  I did use frozen peaches.

Very good muffins. I discovered I had plain vs. vanilla yogurt so I added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla.  I also added some frozen raspberries at that last minute.  I'll make again for sure, trying different fruits.  I love muffins that have yogurt in them!

I followed the recipe to a T, and was careful not to overmix, and these still came out rather dense for my liking. Overall the flavor was ok, and my kids ate them, but neither my husband nor I were impressed.

These muffins were very tasty and resembled peach cobbler, one of my favorites. However, they didn't come out of the muffin pan very easily. I ended up scooping them out into bowls. next time I make this I will put the batter into a casserole dish and treat it like a cake.

Made a double batch and took to Sunday school this morning.  Boy, were they a hit.  I think the key to the moisture is to make sure the butter is melted and the peaches are ripe.  The batter was a little sticky and easy to measure using the ice cream scoop.

Followed the recipe with the freshest, juicy farmers market peaches and my muffins turned out dry and tasteless.

We really liked the flavor of these muffins. I wish I would have put some kind of cinnamon sugar topping on them though, that would have really added to it.  I made half of them with the paper muffin cups and half without (because I ran out). I noticed that the ones in the paper cups cooked better, but the others were slightly mushy in the middle. The ones in the paper cups kept their form better too, because these are really soft muffins.

These were delicious.  I added cinnamon, the extra baking powder and a little milk like others suggested.  This recipe is a keeper.

I needed something to make with my fresh peaches and came upon this recipe!  Wow. So delicious.   My whole family loved them!  Based on other reviews,  I did add 2 t. of baking powder and left the recipe the same- except I sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking.   I liked the recipe so much I gave it to two others that same day and we made it again a week later!

These were just ok for me. Yes, they were moist. Perhaps I didn't like the peach texture. I did use 2 tsp of baking powder as everyone suggested. It seemed like a lot of butter for my taste; if I make again, I'll use sunflower seed oil.

With an abundance of peaches from our trees, I began making muffins.  This was the best out of the 4 different recipes I made.  I used added the 1/2 tsp of baking powder and ended up with 14 muffins.  They were very moist, but kinda bland.  I think I would add poppy seed & perhaps a little cinnamon &/or nutmeg next time and lean towards baking for 15 minutes, not 20.

I love these muffins !! I do not consider fruit pastries of any sorts to be to my liking, however these muffins were moist and the chunks of peaches were juicy. These muffins reminded me of peach cobbler.

Yum!  I didn't have pecans, so used half almonds and half walnuts and loved the almond flavor.  I also used mini muffin pans since I was taking them to potluck and they were perfect.

These muffins were a little disappointing... I didn't use pecans (i dislike them) but I can see how that textural difference may have helped with the overall consistency. I used canned, sliced peaches which made the batter mushy. When I make these again I'll add some chopped hazelnuts, and either chopped fresh peaches, or chop and "roast" the canned peaches before adding them. If that doesn't help the overall "mushiness" I'll add an extra tsp of baking powder the next time.   This could be an easy basic recipe to go back to and alter for whatever flavors you like... raspberry yogurt with raspberries and slivered almonds could be good... or sub half the yogurt with some homemade dulce de leche, add some choco chips and toffee bits and now we have a delicious dessert muffin... the possibilities are endless!

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 t of baking powder.  They did not have a strong peach flavor (I used peach yogurt), were very pale and did not brown up.  Will not make again.

Delicious!  I just finished a batch they are nearly gone.  I used some spiced peach jam instead of fresh and also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and more milk.  Will do again and again!

EXCELLENT muffins!  I've made these often and the yogurt really makes them moist.  I had to add a bit of milk to further moisten them, and a little less sugar.  But overall, these are EXCELLENT muffins!!

Absolutely delicious. These are so moist they could almost pass for cake.  Great way to get my son to grab one (or 2,3,or 4)for breakfastI doubled the batch (24) and they were gone in 2 days. (between 3 people) This is a recipe I'll be passing on to many people and making several times a month.

I tried to make these healthier by using applesauce instead of the butter/margarine, and these came out really good. I also used plain yogurt so put an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I didn't have pecans and used walnuts, which I think taste great. Oh and I used canned peaches but I bet they would be better with fresh.

I really liked these muffins, but they had a floury taste to them.  Instead of pecans I used walnuts and instead of peaches I used blueberries (all I had).  Maybe my switch had something to do with the taste, but still they were really good and I ate every last one!

These taste delicious, but did not rise and are very dense, used peaches that had been frozen, so they may have been a little wet, would like to try it with fresh peaches, but the season is over, so next year.

I made these muffins with canned peaches and they were EXCELLENT!!!  The pecans are a nice touch and they have a nice peach taste and they are very moist.  One thing I did differently was to bake them at 350 oven for the same time. One complaint is that they really don't turn brown that much and they are a fairly small muffin, they do not rise.  But definetly a keeper because of the texture and moistness. Thanks for posting.
