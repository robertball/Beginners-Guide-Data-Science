I had lots of garden herbs to use up so used a mixture of basil, oregano, chives, parsley and sage.  With pipette pasta, it made a great side dish with grilled london broil and a grilled vegetable salad.  My husband said it was the best pasta he has had in ages, and said that if we had gotten this at a restaurant, we would go back just for that pasta.

Very nice pasta dish.  I think maybe I'll add more thyme and sage next time--I'm not really tasting it as much as I'd like.  I used fresh tomatoes since they were starting to look sad, and I add red and orange bell peppers for the same reason.  Bc I added more ingredients, I upped the capers--shouldve done the same with the sage.  Perhaps bc I used raw tomatoes, I added about half a can of V8 juice; the liquid really cooked down quickly and since I wanted to cook as directed, I added tomato juice, which kept it moist.  I didn't find this to be too salty from the capers and tomato juice; I thought it was just right.  I almost never add salt and pepper in recipes unless it is added in the beginning; I prefer to let pple decide at the table if it needs more salt.  I'm glad I left it out this time.  I don't have linguine, or even spaghetti, so I used mini penne and felt it worked well.  Although I did add veggies to this, I think this makes more like four servings; that's okay, I can have for lunches at work this week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, I did cut back on the sage and bay leaf only because that is my families preference.  I also added some blackened chicken to the top when served.  Turned out very good.  Thanks for the post.

This was good, flavorful, and very easy. I used fresh tomatoes and a mix of whole-wheat and regular penne. I topped each serving with Romano cheese and red pepper flakes, which complemented the sauce wonderfully.

Great recipe. Would use considerably less capers though, as the dish turned out quite salty despite the fact that i didn't use any salt at all. And this is coming from a person who likes her food salty. Would make this again.

This was pretty good, my husband liked it. I will make it again. I used penne pasta instead of linguine, its what I had on hand.

I hadn't worked with capers much, but was needing a recipe to try with it. I also have a TON of sage this year so I went for it. I thought it came out fairly well. I marinated some chicken to serve with it, which was a nice addition.

Tasty recipe.  I did add:  1/2 chicken breast that I had precooked & cubed and 8-10 sliced cremini mushrooms.  When I tasted the sauce prior to adding the above ingredients, I thought the sauce tasted great alone, not too salty even with the 2 tbsp capers.

I had to quadruple the amount of pasta.  And we used corkscrew pasta instead of Linguine.  We are a large family... but I have to say it was a very nice change to white sauces.  I used butter to saute instead of olive oil.  We grow most of our foods so I used some diced tomatoes we canned last fall.  Turned out great.  I recommend it.  Would be great for a potluck!
