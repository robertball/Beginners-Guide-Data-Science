This was an excellent pumpkin bread. I substituted one cup of applesauce for the vegetable oil, put the batter equally in a large loaf pan and 4 small ones, and baked them at 350 about 40-45 minutes. They were very moist and had a great flavor. Highly recommended.

Nice recipe!  I reduced the sugar to about 2 cups and oil to 2/3 cup to reduce calories and the taste was still very good.

We tried this recipe during the Thanksgiving holidays.  Everyone loved it and the 2 loaves were gone the same day.  I highly recommend this recipe to cooks with any level of experience.

Very moist and yummy.  I added raisins to mine also.  It did take a bit longer than an hour to cook though, but it was well worth the wait.

My husband introduced me to pumpkin nut bread, and it's one of my favorites.  I only use 2 c sugar, 3 c flour, 1 tsp salt, cloves instead of allspice (and half the amt of cloves and nutmeg), add in 1 T vanilla and double the amount of nuts.  I also had to sub margaine today for oil, because i was out and I couldn't tell a difference.  It makes 2 dozen cupcakes, that I cooked at 350 for 20 min (until toothpick comes out clean).

Very good moist pumpkin bread. I did change a few things to make it a bit healthier. I did half regular flour and half whole wheat. I subtituted all the oil for applesauce and didn't add as much sugar. Still turned out great!

The flavor of this bread is right on. However, the first time I made it, the bread came out oily. The next time I only added 3/4 cup of oil and it came out perfect!

This is bread is so good! I followed the recipe exactly except added some pumpkin pie spice and a little more cinnamon. It had a great taste, I loved it!  The next time I am going to add either raisins or cinnamon chips.

Absolutely wonderful! The extra cinnamon leaves a very light taste but not at all overpowering. I am currently making my 4th batch for this year and it still may not be the last. I make mine without nuts and it is so moist and heavy, noone cares about NO NUTS. Love it!!!!!!!!!

This was awesome!!! I only made a few changes and that was to use 1 cup brown sugar and 2 white (instead of three white) and plopped in a kiddie cinnamon applesauce cup into the mixture. Turns out amazing every time I bake them (which is a lot because my husband eats the whole loaf)!!! Thank you for this recipe!

i found that this pumpkin bread came out really dense and heavy. i used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose so i dont know if that affected it or not. but when i make breads like this i like them to be light and not heavy

I found the 300 degree oven recommended too low to complete the bread in an hour. No problem. I went a little more than one half hour to finish the middle, and it is delicious! Dense, not to sweet and bursting with flavor. Try 350 degrees for 40-45 mins. as one reviewer said. Our oven is 15 years old and could account for extra time.

I was looking for a pumpkin bread recipe last weekend and found this one. I made it and it's great! Very large, dense loafs. I've made this twice and both times it's taken my about an 1 1/2 hours to bake instead of the hour that it says. But I didn't change a thing! Perfect bread! I will be making this a lot for partys and family get togethers this hoilday season!

This pumpkin bread is absolutely delicious! I randomly selected this recipe out of all the pumpkin bread recipes and I am glad that I did! My original plan was to freeze the second loaf, but I'm not sure it's going to make it to the freezer!  I took some suggestions from other reviews and substituted apple sauce for oil and reducing the sugar by one cup.   This bread tastes great by itself and is even better with reduced-fat cream cheese icing!

This is the pumpkin bread recipe I have been looking for. It is so good, don't be afraid to use applesauce instead of oil. I used 1 c. unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and replaced 1 c. of the white flour with whole wheat flour. It turned out to be an excellent pumpkin bread, you really can't tell a difference between using oil or applesauce. The spices give it such a rich flavor and it smells so good when it's baking. I highly recommend this bread!

I followed the recipe to the tee.  Turned out to be tasty but dry.  Pumpkin bread is usually moist, this was dry. I will try a new recipe.

The second time I made this for Boss' Day and everyone at work now wants the recipe. They all raved about this bread! Thanks again for the wonderful recipe!... This was wonderful! Smelled like pumpkin pie baking. I didn't have 2 loaf pans, so I used 1 loaf pan and 1 8x8x2 pyrex dish... they both turned out well. The one in the pyrex was done in the stated time, the one in the loaf pan however, took about 10 more minutes to bake.

This bread is amazing.  Be careful to not overcook your bread or its wonderful moistness will disappear!  I did not have allspice, so instead of the spices listed in the recipe I used the following:  1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/8 tsp. ginger.  All other ingredients (salt, baking powder, baking soda, flour, etc.) I used as normal.  Replacing sugar with Splenda works well with this recipe.  If making standard-sized muffins bake for 30-35 minutes.  This pumpkin bread is highly recommended!

This was my first time trying any pumpkin bread recipe and after reading all of the ones on allrecipes, I settled on this one and boy was it the perfect choice! I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor changes. Some reviewers suggested upping the temperature to 325 degrees and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes so I did and the time and texture were spot-on. Also, I increased the spices to 3 teaspoons cinnamon, 2 teaspoons nutmeg, and 2 teaspoons all spice. 

The recipe yielded 1 loaf of the recommended size and 15 cupcakes!!! Thanks again; my friends and family thank you too! :)

I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out great.  I made it as written, but then made some changes to make it a bit healthier.  I now use whole wheat flour and egg substitute. I decrease the amount of sugar to about two and a half cups. I also substitute half the oil with applesauce, which surprisingly makes no difference in how moist it comes out.  As written, I would give this recipe 3 stars, but with changes, I gave it a 5.

Excellent recipe! I added 1 cup chopped walnuts and baked @ 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  I baked cupcakes @ 350 degree for 30 minutes and they came out moist and delicious.  I am an experienced baker and this recipe rocks!

This bread is really good.  I decided last minute to add 2 mashed bananas to the pumpkin cause they needed to be used and I also used pumpkin pie spice with cinnamon.  It turned out yummy. I am sure the pumpkin alone is just as good.  Oh and I baked in  a 350 oven for only 1 hour. Perfect.

What a yummy fall recipe. I cut it in half to only make 1 loaf, and it turned out great. I substituted half of the oil with applesauce, half of the flour with whole-wheat flour, and sprinkled in some flaxseed. I also added in some chocolate chips. My family loves waking up to eat it for breakfast.

WONDERFUL pumpkin bread recipe! I was in the mood to bake something "fallish" to kick off the beginning of the fall season and found this recipe. Although it isn't the healthiest recipe (next time I'm going to try to make some healthier substiutes for the oil, eggs, etc.) it is an incredibly yummy recipe! I made two loaves- keeping one for us and giving the other one away to my husband's grandparents- they LOVED it. The loaf in our house didn't last for more than two days! I decided to make two more loaves later on in the week but I didn't have quite enough white sugar- so I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also, I only had 3 eggs. It still turned out really yummy- we couldn't tell the difference. This will definitely be added to my fall recipe collection!

This was an ok pumpkin bread, but I think the oven temperature has to be wrong. 300 is just too low. Try 350 or 175 C.

You just make the measurements, add the ingredients together, and bake! It's easy, and it's delicious. My bread took longer to bake at 300 deg., so I turned up the heat to 350.

First time making pumpkin bread and this was amazing.  I substituted with some whole flour, brown sugar, and applesauce.  I slightly increased all the spices too.  I had something to bake at 350 so I just used that temperature and it was done after 60 minutes in the oven.  This was fluffy and light and yummy.

I am an inexperienced baker.  I had never made bread before last night, but I made pumpkin bread last night using this recipe as a base.  
My bread was easy to make, and it was delicious.  It hasn't even been 24 hours, and one loaf has been devoured...and 1/3rd of the other loaf is gone.
I did make a few changes though.
I replaced the one cup of oil with 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  
I only used one cup of sugar and 8 packets of stevia in place of the 3 cups sugar.  
I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour (as well as 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup ground flax seeds)
I sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on top of each loaf before baking.
I spiced it up a little also.  I used 1 and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cloves, 1 teaspoon allspice, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  
I also added 1/2 cup grated zucchini to the batter of the second loaf.
Despite all these substitutions...the bread was extremely moist (but firm). 
The way I made it may not be sweet enough for some, but it was perfect for me.  Others pumpkins bread is more like cake than bread...but this is definately more like bread.
My family loved this bread.  My Mom asked for seconds and then thirds!!! She rarely even asks for seconds.
Next time, I'll up the pumpkin by 1/2 a cup. I really like pumpkin.

Loved this recipe!  Had to cook it longer than the recipe specified (about an hour and a half), but the end result was great!  I also omitted the walnuts and added semi-sweet mini chocolate chips.  Everyone who tasted it loved it, will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe....instead of nuts I used finely chopped apples and raisins.  The tart apples balanced with the sugar.  Next time will use 1 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 cup apples instead of 3 cups of sugar.  My family loved it!!

The ingredients in this recipe are not commonly found in someones house. The prepartion did not take alots of time and clean up was minimal. The directions were very easy to follow. Before baking, we think the top of the loaf should be smoothed for more even baking and a better apperance. The cook time was also an hour which was one disadvantage. We think the temperature of the oven should be decreased because the bread turned out dry. We think that this reciped needs more sugar because it was very bland. The nuts were good because they added good flavor and texture. Overall we didn't like this recipe because it didn't taste good.

I lost my old tried & tested pumpkin bread recipe and used this one instead. It was dry and flavourless. Not enough pumpkin at all and I would add water or more oil for moistness.

I just served this and it was great. Like everyone else, I make modifications. In this case I added a ribbon of cream cheese. Mix one egg, 6 oz cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar together. Pour 1/3 cup batter in each pan. Spread cream cheese mixture over batter and then add remaining batter, covering the filling. It was very good.

This bread was quick, easy, moist and flavorful. I personally would like to have a bit more pumpkin flavor, so I will try the previous suggestions to add fresh pumpkin, and reduce the sugar. Very good snacking cake!

Just made this and sampled it-yummy!  I think I would add another tsp of cinnamon next time.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I also baked it at *325.  But over-all really good and moist!

My whole family loves this recipe; my mom in particular. I wish I knew how to make it a bit more moist and less crumbly than mine usually turns out but either way it's very yummy.

This recipe is a winner.  I doubled it, added 1/2 cup brown sugar and a splash (2 tsp) of vanilla.  It made 2 loaves, a bundt ring and 12 muffins.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I've had this in my book for a couple of years and ironically found the same recipe here online. My version however always yields 3 loaves for some reason, and I bake it at 350 for 1 hour. I love to modify each loaf by adding mini chocolate chips or nuts. They freeze very well and are great treats for drop-in visitors!

Super easy to make, light clean up, great recipe!  After reading other reviews, I reduced the sugar to about 2 cups and replaced half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce... and the result was awesome!  I made two batches, one with the half cup of walnuts and one with a cup of raisins.  Both absolutely delicious.

I made this for my mom who loves pumpkin bread... I do not love pumpkin bread but with this recipe I do now.  Brought mom a loaf and left one here mine is almost gone.  

I reduced oil in half and substituted half with applesauce also did 1/3 dark brown sugar and the rest white sugar I did reduce the white sugar by 1/4 cup.

Thanks for the recipe will make this often I am sure.

After baking for the required time & temperature stated in the recipe the center was still gooey.  I turned up the oven to 350 and baked for another 20 minutes until the knife came out clean.  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it!!

FABULOUS.  I made this recipe last night and used a heavy bundt pan.  I had to increase bake time to 1 hr., 30 minutes.  (I also doubled the walnuts to 1  cup).  It came out beautiful, very moist and flavorful.  Thank you Amy!

This was really good.  I too cut the sugar by about 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 oil in place of the 1 c. oil.  It was still super moist.  A big note though--this recipe took nowhere near an hour!  It was about 1 hour 40 minutes.  I wonder if the oven temp. is too low?  Anyway, just be prepared.  Also, there is way too much mix for two pans.  I'd leave a good inch below the pan, mine spilled all over my oven and now I have a huge mess to clean up!

I've made this recipe twice and have been told "it's the best you've ever made"!  I found that at 300 degrees, the bread took much longer than an hour so I increased oven temp to 325 and cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

This is amazing!  Don't tell my mom but I think this recipe for pumpkin bread beats hers! It was quick and simple to whip up. I omitted the nuts because I don't care for them and I used olive oil instead of Crisco.  Turned out fabulous!

This bread tastes wonderful. I did double all of the spices, add some ground cloves, and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. But with the amount of sugar, this "bread" should be called "cake".

Delicious!  Next time I would reduce the oil (as another commenter mentioned).  The texture was a bit too "wet" for my liking.

I loved it, but I also altered it some.  Using melted butter in place of oil and adding a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp more of each of the all spice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also added a 1/4 tsp of ginger and cloves.  It was super moist and very flavorful!

NOTE: the bread does not get done at 300 degrees for 1 hour. Probably should be 350 for an hour. The allspice is too over-powering for my taste. I would leave it out if I were to make this again. The bread is REALLY moist though!

I've been wanting to make pumpkin bread for years. I knew nothing about it, and I've only tried it once 7 years ago. This recipe  was simple enough that even I could do it and MAN was it great. It makes a ton so I ran out of pans but I improvised. I had plenty to give to family, and now my boyfriend keeps asking for it. :)

Delicious!  I made this for a baby shower along with the Hot Spiced Cranberry Cider (recpie on this site) and together they were a huge hit!  It baked for longer than the recipe stated but came out fine in the end and was delicious, sweet and spicy.  I served it with pecan honey butter on top and the guests loved it.

This is my second year making this pumpkin bread and my family just loves it. It is truly  moist, dense and flavored with the right amount of spice. It tastes like autumn. Sometimes I bake it so the middle comes out creamy and a bit underdone. That's the best!

I thought this pumpkin bread was perfect. The 3 c. of sugar looked like a lot, but it brought out the pumpkin and spice flavors perfectly. I did make two slight changes: 1 c. whole wheat flour replaced 1 c. of white flour, and 1 c. raisins instead of the nuts. My whole family enjoyed this, especially my nine-month-old!

Great recipe!  Use only 2 cups of sugar, though - 3 cups is way too sweet.  Moist, sweet, flavorful, and just mmmm-mmmmm.

This is a delicious bread -- very moist and sweet. I substituted 1 cup of raisins for the walnuts, and it was outstanding! I agree with others however - the 300 degree oven is not hot enough. I baked mine at 350 for 1 hour, and tested for doneness. Worked for me.

This was wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and only 1/2 cup of oil and didn't miss the oil.  And used pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had.  I split into one loaf and one pan of muffins - the oven cooking time worked great for the loaf, but it was a little too long for the muffins in my oven.  Didn't matter, still turned out great.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have allspice so I added cloves.  I made them into muffins (w/o the walnuts) and it was a real hit.

i loved this recipe!  i used a 30 oz pumpkin puree can by mistake and so i just decides to double the recipie and it turned out great.  when i was making the mix it seemed like A LOT of mix but when i put it into the loaf pans it was only three loafs.  i would recomend doubling it if you have more than seven people.  my family and friends loved it.

I believe the cooking time for this otherwise yummy recipe is a little too short.  We got a very beautiful loaf of bread from testing with a toothpick though and cooking for 10/15 min longer than suggested.

Had to cook for MUCH longer than 1 hour. Did not taste that good and had middle drooling out after about an hour or an hour and 15 minutes. Difficult to deal with.

Delicious!  I made this with 1 c. applesauce instead of the vegetable oil, cut the sugar back to 1 3/4 c., left out the walnuts and made 24 muffins.  Soooooooo good!  I'll definitely make this again.

The flavor is perfect. The only thing i had a problem with was it being dry. That could of been a cooking error though. The top center of the bread didn't want to cook so i had to cut it off, i left in the bread longer but i didn't want it to burn.

I love this recipie; however, I'll use less sugar than the recipie indicates.  It was too sweet.  At 325 degrees one hour cooking time was sufficient.  Will definately bake this one again.

Make multiple batches of this every holiday season. Always a hit. Sometimes swapping half the white sugar for brown. I also usually play with the spices too, swapping out some of the cinnamon for allspice or ginger

Delicious just as written, EXCEPT oven temperature of 300 has to be wrong.  At one hour, bread nowhere near done. I turned oven up to 350 for another 15 minutes and it was perfect. Would take others’ recommendation of 350 for less time. Will play with it next time but the bread is fantastic.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and baked in mini loaf pans (Wilson 18 mini loaf pan) and it was delicious. Everybody I shared them with loved them! For the mini loafs , time was reduced to 30 minutes. I checked after 20 but they were no where near done. Will  bake again with walnuts this time!

Halved the recipe to make one loaf - I think I should have bumped up the spices a bit, but this is still a nice bread.  Didn't add any nuts or other add-ins because I was baking a variety of breads and wanted one without any nuts or anything.  Nice basic recipe that tastes good the same day, but even better after a day or two.

I used 3/4 cup oil; 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup Splenda.  Next time I will add 1/4 cup applesauce.  Also, at 300 deg for 1 hour it was not done.  Suggest 350 deg. (depends on oven).

This was delicious! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice mix so I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, and 1/4 tsp ginger.

I added Cloves and my family devoured the two huge loaves this recipe calls for.  This recipe is AMAZING.  Note to self:  This takes much much longer than 1 hour.  I checked mine every 10 minutes after the hour.  Mine took 40 minutes longer baking at 300.

This recipe has way too much sugar. When I make it again I will reduce the amount to 2cups.

I made 24 cupcakes.. 350' for 20 minutes in a dark pan, 25 minutes in tin pans.  Substituted applesauce for the oil.  Added Craisins instead of walnuts.  Very moist and delicious!

Love The Recipe  Prefect For 2 Loaves Or 4 Small Ones. I Used 2C BreadFloor &1 1/2 C Wholewheat Instead. Also Used Pecans.  Awesome Taste.

This is really, really good.  I didn't have quite enough pumpkin on hand so used some leftover sweet potatoes from last nights supper.    I only put in 2 cups of sugar as it called for an awful lot of sugar.  I tried the suggestion of unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil and it still tastes amazing.  This will be my go to recipe.

I've made this a few times now; I'm making breads instead of cookies for the holidays. Like others I substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil and added raisins for interest. Doubled, this recipe makes 6 regular loaves for gifts. Thanks!

This bread is tasty however, I did not find it to be as moist as some other reviewers noted.  My bread came out rather dense, which I like, but if you want something fluffy choose a different recipe.  Also, while this bread tastes great, it isn't very pumpkiny.  More of a spice bread with a hint of pumpkin.  

Like other reviewers, I found that this bread needed to bake much longer than stated.  I thought 300 was too low so I set the oven to 325 and ended up having to bake my bread for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Just pulled this bread from the oven! Followed the exact recipe. This bread was very moist however you cannot taste the pumpkin at all! If I hadn't cooked it and somebody gave it to me and called it pumpkin bread, I wouldnt believe them. Tastes more like a spice cake to me. I had such high hopes for this recipe because overall, it had great reviews. Don't get me wrong, the flavor IS great but if you are looking for a true pumpkin bread, this isnt the recipe.

My roomates devour this bread.  It is so good!  I also add some ginger and more walnuts and I only put in a half cup of oil and a half cup of applesauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!
