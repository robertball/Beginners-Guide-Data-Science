Yummy!  I NEVER say yummy, but in this case it was the first word that entered my mind when I thought about how I’d describe this.  Maybe it’s because I love spinach, mushrooms and garlic, and particularly when all three are used at once.  Or maybe it’s because these eggs sort of mimic an omelet I make a copy-cat version of from a now defunct breakfast/brunch restaurant in Milwaukee.  It’s distinctive ingredient?  Cream cheese.  Little creamy, gooey, slightly tangy bits of cream cheese.   Put all four ingredients into the eggs and it’s no wonder I said yummy.  Even Hubs, who rarely rates recipe five stars, said that as far as eggs go, this couldn’t be any better – five stars from him too! (Note: With six eggs I didn't bother to try and cook this without stirring and then flipping this big panful.  Rather, I just cooked this as scrambled eggs, in long, fluffy curds)

I made this for Sunday breakfast, a couple of things. After adding the eggs, I turned the heat to low and covered the skillet to help the eggs set, it is not easy to flip this if the top is still runny.  I would suggest a cheese other than cream cheese.  Maybe a nice white cheese that melts well.  The cream cheese didn't melt well and looked a little messy.  Thanks for a delicious breakfast.

Fabulous recipe. Our guests at The Wary Buffalo B&B enjoy it often! I made it just as written, however, it's very hard to "flip" a large, six-egg omelet. Instead, I cover it to cook the eggs throughout and melt the cheese, then fold it into thirds and slide it on the plate. Just awesome!

Eggcellent breakfast dish!! I  enjoyed this one so much that I made it two days in a row last week :) I went to Costco today to buy the ingredients so I can make it for the husband this week. You are going to need a big spatula to flip this one, I just fold it in thirds once it starts to firm up. Perfect as is, but I sprinkled grape tomatoes that I cut in half right before serving (see photo;) Thanks Kel Kel for sharing your delicious recipe!

This was really delicious. I wasn't able to flip it properly so it ended up more scrambled but the flavors together are amazing. I wouldn't change a thing!

delicious and very filling.   As in one of the pictures, I topped it with diced cherry tomatoes, added a bit of sweetness and made a beautiful presentation.  I also added some real bacon bits, but I'm sure it would be delicious without this addition. Will certainly make again.  Simple enough, yet "fancy" enough to serve for company.

Delicious!  We made it exactly as suggested. Just a few details,  we did use Sliced Mushrooms from the store but they still seemed too big and we did cut the slices in half so they were more manageable bite sizes.  For the Spinach I cut stems off then coarsely cut it all so I had smaller pieces to.  Working the mushrooms and spinach this way more evenly distribute the ingredients.  I did cover the pan to help the top set before flipping.  Served with Rye bread toast.  I love this recipe, so Good!!!!

I made it for one, using one egg, 4 sliced fresh mushrooms, 1 tsp cream cheese and handful of fresh chopped spinach. It was delicious, quick and easy!

Used a handful of shredded mozzarella instead of cream cheese. Left out mushrooms.  Very good, will make again.

Super! Easy and oh so tasty. I didn’t have mushrooms so I added onions. I also didn’t flip it I just put the lid on to let the cheeses melt. (Which I added mozzarella and sharp cheddar as well). I almost forgot to take a pic so it’s in the skillet half gone already. Will be making it again. Thank you!

It was ok, but nothing great. Could use a bit more seasoning. It was quick and easy to make. My daughter and I prefer spinach and feta omelet to this with the cream cheese, and we love cream cheese.

It wasn’t as easy as the instructions made it seem. I probably should have had it on low as the bottom browned rather quickly. Not bad overall but I definitely think it needed more seasoning in general.

The recipe was solid.  I do prefer my crustless spinache quiche though.
