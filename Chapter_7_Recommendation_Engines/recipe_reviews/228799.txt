This was good, but like the other review, there is something missing. Maybe more salt in the crust to off-set the sweet topping? And the crust maybe a bit too thick, it seemed overwhelming. Small adjustments and this could be one heck of a dessert!

something's not quite right with this recipe.  the only thing I changed was I substituted butter for margarine which shouldn't have made a difference.  It needs tweeking but I'm not sure exactly where.... I only say this because other reviewers will make this recipe and they need to know...mine came out dry and I only cooked them 22 minutes and I followed the recipe exactly. However, having said that my husband and daughter really liked them so based on that I rated it a 4
