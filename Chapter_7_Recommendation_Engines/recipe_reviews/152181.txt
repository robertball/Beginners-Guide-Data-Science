I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was tasty.  The allspice, rum, and horseradish gave it a unique deliciousness.  I normally make pot roast in my crock pot, so this was the first time I had made beef gravy from the drippings.  I thickened it with corn starch and cream.  The bay and allspice flavors were very pleasant.  I considered using a half cup of bay leaves like the recipe suggested, but that would have tapped me out, so I just used 3 leaves instead.

This recipe worked very well for me -- I needed a pot roast and I didn't have time for the Crock Pot. While I agree that it didn't taste near as strong as it smelled, if you make a gravy from the pan drippings and use it on the meat it was wonderful! I also didn't want to use up all of my bay leaves so I crumbled up three of them. I also used ground allspice generously. I will definitely make this again.

Really special and different than the pot roast from my childhood.  The allspice berries and horseradish were great additions.  I used brandy instead of rum.  My daughter, who is not a beef fan, loved it. Sides of mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts went perfectly.

I served this for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. It got raves from the youngest after the first bite.

Love how the reviewer down below rates this recipe negatively because she didn't like the review I left on one of her recipes.

Honestly, I have NO clue what all the fuss is about? This beef was okay but surely nothing to rave about. It was moist but the flavoring wasn't doing it for us. Pot Roast it isn't. It has an odd taste. I cooked it and had to double the seasoning to cover the meat. I can make a better pot roast  in 1/2 the time, that comes out just as moist and tastier. I also don't get the "Autumn" part?

We found the recipe as it is written a bit bland. The roast came out tender and the rum and allspice added a unique flavor, but it just was not happening for us. We doctored up the gravy with browning sauce, thickened it with browned flour and also sour cream, salt and pepper. I would not have enjoyed the roast without the gravy. Maybe someone who enjoys milder seasonings in their recipes would appreciate this one.

This roast is really good, my husband has been asking for it every since I made it the first time.  I am now on time number 4.  I strain the juices after the roast is cooked and make a gravy delicious

I added mushrooms and cooked in a chicken fryer pan \. The roast fell apart and it was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Loved this. The only rum I had was my husband's bottle of Kracken. It was fantastic, but next time I will go with normal spiced rum to save some $$.  Also we don't like onions so I put baby carrots in the bottom of my crock pot and onion powder in the flour mixture. Delicious.
