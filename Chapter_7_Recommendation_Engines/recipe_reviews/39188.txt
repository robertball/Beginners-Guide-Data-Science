These truffles are good... but almost not worth the trouble. What the recipe neglects to say is that a food processor is required. I don't have one, and used a blender. Tedious work to "crumb" the wafers in this manner. 

Also, the recipe ingredients list should list the powdered sugar twice, as one-half is used in the mix, and 1/4 is used as a dusting. This is not specified clearly enough.

These truffles are delicious and very flavorful. I made them for Christmas and my family loved them.

Another review said you have to crumb the wafers in a food processor or blender, but I put them in a plastic bag and smashed them with a glass. It's pretty easy. But you do have to grind the nuts. I used my coffee grinder.

I think the recipe is perfect. I usually change recipes, but this one was great as-is. The only difference I found is that it made way less than 4 dozen. They would have to be miniscule to get that many.

These are great and they freeze really well. But I don't dust them before hand if they are going to be frozen.

Wow! These were great! I would suggest letting these refrigerate overnight - it gets rid of the "crumb" texture.

I would say it is just me, but given the feedback I've gotten...these just aren't good.  I've made them as directed, w/ Grand Marnier, & w/ orange juice.  These have a granular (yes I ground everything w/ my food processor) quality that I just don't like.

I didn't add the chocolate into the recipe, and I added a little vanilla, nutmeg, and ground cloves into the mixture. I refrigerated it overnight and used the chocolate to dip the truffles in to create a more pumpkin flavored center. I also used apple juice instead of the liqueur. They turned out really good. Next time, I will probably just use pumpkin pie spice and a little vanilla.

BEWARE!!! The powdered sugar needs to be divided up BEFORE you put it into the mixture. I almost made a huge mistake by putting too much! We made these for a progressive dinner and everyone loved them!

This recipe was not to my liking at all.  The version of this recipe that I found actually said to toast the almonds and it said that apple juice could be substituted for the coffee liqueur.  With these adaptations, my opinion is this: 1. I could not taste the pumpkin; 2. the almonds were overpowering; and 3. the chocolate was definitely rich (not a compliment).  This recipe should be called Rich Chocolate Almond Truffles.  Just because there's pumpkin in it, that doesn't mean it should be in the name.  The name as it is is misleading.  I was really looking forward to having a pumpkin-tasting truffle, and this recipe let me down.

We loved these! They have dark chocolate/ cinnamon/ coffee slight bitterness to them, so which I love. I did use my food processor to "crumb" the cookies, and I ground them fairly fine. The comments before regarding the division of the powdered sugar were very helpful. I got 48 truffles out of the recipe and let them refridgerate for several hours before serving. No complaints.

My coworkers absolutely loved these. I only put in about 1/4 C of Kahlua instead of 1/3. While melting the chocolate I added the Kahlua and pumpkin so it was mixed nicely before adding to the dry mixture.

A HUGE disappointment.  Unless you can pulzerize the almonds into a fine powder, the conisistency will be grainy. But even above and beyond the unappealing texture, they just plain don't taste very good.  I follwed the recipe exactly, and all I could taste was the vanilla from the cookies and the cinnamon -- certainly no pumpkin taste and only mildly chocolately, even though I used a quality chip (Ghiardelli, a mixture of dark and semi-sweet).  Finally, the finished product is very soft.  Unless you're eating them right out of the fridge, they're pretty gooey; after sitting out for half an hour, the powdered sugar coating just dissolves. I suppose you could mitigate that somewhat by rolling them in chopped nuts, but I wasn't about to go to the trouble and expense. Definitely not something I would give as a gift or serve to guests.  I ended up adding enoughpumpkin and chocolate to cover the vanilla and cinnamon and make it a dip.  It wasn't bad with apple slices and pretzels, but way too much work and cost to justify the end result.  I wouldn't make this again.

I used gingersnaps, walnuts, and pumpkin pie spice instead of vanilla wafers,  almonds, and cinnamon.  They turned out a bit too chocolately and not enough pumpkin-y for my taste, but have gotten rave reviews.  (I'm not the biggest chocolate fan.)  Next time I'd substitute some pumpkin for the chocolate.
