I didn't have any green onions, so I threw in fresh chives.  And I had lots of cheddar cheese and no sour cream.  And we don't like rice so I... am just kidding.  It cracks me up, how we all fiddle with recipes.  I did fiddle with this one to suit my pantry.  It was easy.  It was delicious.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  I'm keeping it.

A good recipe for leftover rice. I did have to change a bit. I had 3 1/2 cups of rice,I used a whole can of corn, 1 1/2 cups of cheese, 2 tablespoons of oregano, salt and pepper. Still seemed to be missing something. I will try some different spices and maybe add more veggies next time.

This turned out very good.  I doubled the recipe to take to a potluck.  I mad a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I used brown rice cooked in chicken stock and I used low fat half and half instead of milk.  I had some that I needed to use up.  I used Monterey Jack cheese and added about a 2 tablespoons of feta cheese with tomato and basil.  I also used Durkees Steak Seasoning.  By using the steak seasoning and the feta cheese, this turned out to be a very flavorful casserole.  Several people asked be for the recipe.  I will be making this again.

I took other reviewers advice and cooked my rice in homemade chicken stock with minced garlic and a couple tbsp. of butter. I also used a full 8 oz. monterey jack cheese. I had half of a can of evaporated milk from when I made BBQ Glazed Homemade Meatballs(also from this site) so I used that so there was no waste. I added a tsp. of Frank's hot sauce and a tbsp. of Jack Daniel's dijon mustard. Just trying to pep it up a bit. I'll update how everyone liked it after dinner. EDITED: Meh. Just okay, even with my changes. Hot with the kids, too bland for the grownups. Sorry. I tried.

Very good...I used brown rice and added some garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and Tony's seasoning.  Very good bones though with the cheese and sour cream duo!  Will make again.  Kids and hubby liked it alot!  Thanks for sharing.

I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and it was very creamy!  My taste buds had to get used to the taste of this dish because it was different.  After the first few portions, I enjoyed it.

I needed something quick for a pot luck and had everything in the house. I never use white rice, I mix brown rice with equal amounts of wild rice for a nice texture and flavor.  Everyone's reviews were great and I rely on this a lot.  I added half pepper jack and half cheddar, and  sprinkled some garlic powder, used the whole can of drained corn and a good cup of chopped green onions.  It is delicious even cold before I baked.  Will make this again especially for a crowd.

very good! I substituted Greek Yogurt for the sour cream, and added a few shakes of black pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I served it along side homemade buffalo wings.

This was easy to make, but didn't have much flavor.  there was no way this was going to fit into a 1qt casserole, and it fed way more than 6!

This was way too dry.  I think the flavor combination was o.k. after a few modifications to my tastes, but couldn't get over how dry it was.  Not a big hit with the family.

Too bland. Needs garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I used brown rice, fat free milk, and fat free sour cream to make it healthier.

This turned out really well, but I did make a couple of changes based on what was in my pantry.  I skipped the green onions and corn.  I added about 8 turns of the McCormick's Steakhouse Seasoning Grinder.  I didn't measure the cheese, but I used about 6 ounces of Monterey Jack.  I only used 1/3 c milk (because I'm too lazy to wash two measuring cups) and I used brown rice.  It was delicious!  True comfort food.

This was somewhere between a 4 and a 5 with only minor alterations.  When I made the rice, I prepared it with chicken base in the water, so more like a broth than anything else.  (This was because of all the reviews that said that the recipe was bland.)  I also used cheddar because it was what I had.

Came out good and the family said that this recipe was a keeper; they DEFINTELY want it again.  It's easy and can fit simply into a supperm prep schedule, which is key.

Great simple way to change up rice, I made it with 1 cup of rice, used lots of cheese but I would put butter in the warm rice before I tossed it with everything else for flavour and lubrication but turned out great! Browned cheese on top and S&P to your taste is required IMO.

This was very yummy.  I used brown rice and added a few mild green chilis and it gave it a little more flavor and kick.

My family really liked this recipe. I used 4 cups of cooked jasmine rice and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I also used shredded sharp cheddar and was very generous with it. I didn't have green onions so I minced half of a Vidalia onion, and it turned out great! I will definitely make this again!

It was okay...a little bland even though I had spiced it up a little.  The only saving grace was that I had put A LOT of cheese on it.  If I make this again I'm definately going to add some flavour...garlic, carmalized onions, roasted peppers...I'll have to think about it.

I used broccoli in place of the green onion.  Taste was ok but the sour cream and milk made it a weird "curdled" texture for me.  Next time will sub softened cream cheese for milk & s. cream?

Very good recipe.  I had no green onions so I used dried chives instead.  I also used a combination of cheeses, mostly cheddar and monterey jack.  Absolutely delish.

Good but not great. After reading the reviews I precooked my rice in vegetable stock to give it more flavor and I also added a lot of other vegetables such as broccoli and zucchini... but we still found it bland.

I really liked this recipe and so did my kids but my husband did not care for it at all.  He told me to never make it again.  I did not use corn though I substituted corn for a frozen mixed vegetable mix and used cheddar cheese instead.  I will still make it for my girls and me.

Very good corny, cheesy rice.  Mine ended up with milk in the bottom of the dish after baking, but I think that was because I used a whole grain red rice.  We still enjoyed it for dinner and leftover the next day for lunch.

Love the simplicity, the only thing I’d add is butter because for us it was a little bland without it.

Super simple side dish which accompanies chicken (or would any meat) very. This isn’t fancy, but you could dress it up as you wish. Wintery, warm comfort food. I recommend greasing the casserole dish.

I had no green onions so I rehydrated freeze dried onions. It tasted good.  We served it with oven fried chicken, but I can see adding  meat  and making it a full meal casserole.

I thought it was too bland.  I made it exactly following the directions.  I won't make it again.

I sauteed a 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion in 1 Tablespoon of Margarine instead of using green onions.  I followed the recipe other than that and it was good.  Next time, I will use 1/2 Monterrey Jack cheese and half Mozzarella or Velveeta for a creamier cheese.

I don't normally do this, but I made a lot of changes.  But, I think the integrity of the dish is still here.  Also, if you're a Packers fan you could serve this for a game, with the modifications I made it comes out green and gold!  I used mozzarella as the cheese, grilled corn off the cob, added 1 whole diced green pepper, and a teaspoon of black pepper.  Be sure to get some of the green from the onion in there, too.  Lastly, be sure to use a 1.5 quart baking dish or you'll run out of room.  Everything else the same.

I substituted frozen peas for the corn, and used a can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk. Came out of the oven thick, creamy and delicious!

So easy to make, and tasted great! Lots of cheese which I liked. Added small amount of salt & pepper just to tone the taste for my liking. Wonderful way to use left-over rice. One thing that I regretted was; I didn't have a sour cream in my pantry, so I omitted, but still I loved it! I am sure with the sour cream, the original recipe would rock! Will make it again (with sour cream, of course!).

Onions were too strong. Needs more spice/seasoning overall.

This was a very good recipe - I had to substitute a mexican 4 cheese fiesta blend for the jack cheese, because that's what I had, but everything else was as written.  Delicious and quick, good comfort type food, and I imagine it will be quite adaptable to a full meal once I have time to play around with tossing in some chicken or ham, or maybe some different veggies.   This stays in my recipe box. :)

My family and I love this recipe!!! I did change it up a little bit but most of the recipe stayed the same. I added some cilantro to the rice and some on top. I also cooked some shrimp with butter, lemon, and cilantro (We love cilantro lol). The shrimp were added to the top after taking it out of the oven. Turned out amazing and everyone had seconds!!

Very simple and very tasty.  Instead of sourcream I used regular cream cheese.    Thinking on doing something similar but with pasta so it could be served as a cold plate.

I loved this recipe.  I changed only a couple things; I used low fat cream cheese instead of sour cream and I did not use onions, and I thought it made an excellent rice casserole.

We did not like this recipe. I used a different cheese so maybe that was the problem.

This was easy to make, though a little bland. I'd probably make it again, but with a little modification.  Adding salt and pepper to taste was enough to make this worth recommending.

I love rice and I thought this was wonderful! It was easy to make and very satisfying. I used leftover rice from chineese food so it didn't go to waste. I will definately make it again.

This recipe has potential but was very bland.  I used a mix of mozzerella cheese and cheddar,(all I had).I though it was ok husband did not like. Looking for a good recipe for leftover white rice. Chunky/spicy tomato sauce may help this?

This was just okay.  I wanted to try this recipe because I'm on a quest to find a rice casserole without a soup, as I'm allergic to flour.  I halved the recipe but kept all of the sour cream because I wanted it to be creamy, but it was really dry and flavorless.  I ate it, but would not make again without serious modifications.
