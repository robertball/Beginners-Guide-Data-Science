This was the first time I'd ever cooked with cabbage, and I was a little confused about what "chopped cabbage" meant. I used a Savoy cabbage and cut it into bite-sized pieces. The pork turned out surprisingly moist, and even though I didn't think I'd like the cabbage... my husband and I both enjoyed it. It did burn on the bottom, but we both kind of liked the darker done cabbage. Next time I think I'll take the pork out at the end of the cook time (after cooking at a little lower temp to prevent burning) and then saute the cabbage just a little bit longer to get more caramelization on it.

Hubby and I both enjoyed this.  Super simple and surprisingly has a decent flavor.  Cuts down easily too...I used only 4 pork chops and cooked less than 30 minutes.

Delicious! An excellent, easy meal. I added an onion to the cabbage and cooked it on low(250) in my electric skillet. The chops are not dry at all and the worcheshire sauce lends a lovely aroma and flavour!

This recipe makes the pork extremely moist!  I added a little onion to the cabbage. When I put the cabbage under the pork, for the last fifteen minutes, I added lots of sliced apples.  I seasoned the pork with lemon pepper. Everyone I've served this to loves it!

Good and easy meal. I made this yesterday and added sliced yellow onion and chicken broth.  Next time, I will experiment with additional seasonings as it seemed to need more flavor for my taste.

Absolutely delicious!  I added some chopped red onion but that was the only change.  Will definately make at least twice a month.  Thanks!

I loved the simplicity.  The overall taste was simple and filling.  I ALMOST substituted the worcestershire sauce for balsamic vinegar but wanted to try the recipe as is.  Glad I did. It didn't overpower anything! Will be making this again.

Great quick comfort food meal.  I had a piece of pork sirloin that I needed to use (cheaper, tougher cut), and I cut 1/2 inch slices across the grain instead of using chops. I also added some chopped onion, as suggested by other reviewers.  It worked well, and was delicious!

We love this recipe! The flavor of the cabbage compliments the pork very well. In fact, we had a hard time deciding if the meat or the cabbage tasted better. Together, they are awesome. It may seem that a full head of cabbage takes a long time to reduce, but with patience it will; just stay with it. This is a simple, somewhat healthy, tasty recipe. What more could a cook want?

Great recipe.  The meat is tender and moist, and the cabbage crispy and delicious.  I will leave out the worchestershire sauce next time, though, and instead flavor with caraway seeds, sliced onion and apple.  Can't wait.

This was super easy, it saved on the number of pots I had to use, and it was delicious! The pork and cabbage were so tender! I paired them with mashed potatoes, and I topped the pork with Paula Dean's Southern Peach BBQ sauce. I will definitely make this again and again and again!

Followed the recipe to a tee. PERFECT. My family all likes HOT & SPICY so I added a little Jalapeño sauce I made to it when it was done.

Good, fairly quick, and very easy.  I will probably add green onions next time to give it more flavor and use season salt on the chops and no salt on the cabbage.  Nothing fancy, but good for a week-night meal.

Great recipe! I do like the chops to look more desirable so I brush them with Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce. I am making this right now and it smells delish!

This was so easy and delicious! I had super-thick loin chops so I cut them in half to make them thinner. I used a bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage and carrot), which made this even quicker and easier. I seasoned the pork chops with a mix of equal amounts black pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, thyme and Old Bay. Once browned,  I added the bag of  coleslaw mix, salt and Worcestershire sauce; put on the lid and let it cook. Even my son, who is not a fan of cooked cabbage, really liked it.

Don't know if it was the ingredients, the cook, or the recipe but chops were tough and cabbage not cooked after 30 min.  I like the idea of the recipe though and the combination of ingredients.  May try again or not.

I fixed this for dinner last night, not expecting too much, just needed a fast easy recipe for pork loin.  We were very pleasantly surprised, everyone loved the recipe, will definitely be fixing again.  Made the recipe as written, except I added onion to the cabbage, very good!

I might try this again if I'm feeling adventurous but mine came out REALLY REALLY salty. I don't see any other reviewers saying they had the same experience though - maybe I did something weird! Not sure. The pork itself was pretty good, I think it was mostly the cabbage that was so salty... maybe will use less Worcestershire sauce next time.

Great recipe!  So simple.  I added onions in with the cabbage and used 1 inch cut pork loin.  Meat was tender and cabbage was perfect.  I don't usually care for worcestershire but it really paired well with the cabbage!  Husband (the cook) loved it too!

Super easy and really quick, my two favorite combos. Full of flavor, actually it will have as much flavor as seasoning you put on it, right.

Easy to make and very tasty!  Based on other reviews, I also added one chopped sweet vidalia onion to the cabbage  and I thought it was a good combo. I never used  Worchestire sauce with cabbage before but I sure will in the future ----- great combination!

As written, this is an excellent, easy, inexpensive, fast dish.  I'm still tinkering with it.  I have a gas stovetop.  If you have gas, too, you might want to consider halving the cooking times and keeping heat on lower medium to avoid cabbage crisps.  Definitely throw in some onion.  Heard others mention apple slices and chicken broth.  All kinds of potential variations with this  (maybe sauerkraut and onion with a Dijon mustard coat on the chop?) This is a very low-fat cut o'meat so low and slow is key.

We thoroughly enjoyed this. I did spice it up a bit. I used a Cajun rub on chops & used Cajun spices instead of season salt.

What a simple recipe that was both satisfying and tasty. Like other reviewers I added onions and apples.  My husband and son really enjoyed it.  I will make it again.

I made this yesterday and combined it with another recipe for fried cabbage.  Followed the recipe with the exception of adding two pats of butter on top of the cabbage in the beginning step and added two teaspoons brown sugar, a dash of garlic powder and a dash of onion powder. Next time I will add a little soy sauce and sliced onion, delicious.  I do not recommend using pork loin, tends to dry out even with searing first.

I tried this out of curiosity but I was not impressed enough to try again. I do my cabbage and pork chops a little different. All I use is boneless chops, cabbage, a little water & Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning. I just cut the cabbage into 1 inch strips. I put about a half inch of water in large skillet and turn on the heat to bring water to boil. I add the cabbage and cover and steam in the water for about 5 minutes.  I dust the pork chops with Tony's, not much just a bit for flavor. I then place the seasoned chops on top of the cooking cabbage. In about 10 minutes you will have tender chops and good cabbage. I find the Tony's seasons the pork and the cabbage. If you like salt you will have to add some but not till the cooking process is done. The salt will toughen both the chop & the cabbage.

I change the recipe some.  I used soul seasoning and a beef cube, we don't like worcester sauce, we also change the oil to water to lower the fat. We are both diabetic and have to watch what we eat. We put in in the microwave on height for 30 minutes. My family loved it! It's become a fast dinner at our house that everyone asks for. Make sure if you do it this way you use thin boneless pork loin or it won't get done.

This was wonderful! There were no leftovers, and the kids kept coming back for more. I used thin sliced pork loin chops, and I did add an onion. Moist and tasty!

Tried the suggestion of adding sliced apples. My wife didn't care for that so I'd skip that next time. I seasoned the pork with lemon pepper and also added onions in with the cabbage. Overall the recipe works and the pork came out moist and well seasoned.

Very easy and very tasty. The meat was very tender. I also added onions and I also found it a tad salty, but not too much. I didn't have Worcester sauce so I used Pickapeppa.

This had a good flavor though the pork was awfully dry and not really tender.  I think next time I'll add some chicken broth or other liquid to simmer the meat in.

I don't know how to rate this recipe.  My husband and I both LOVED the pork.  It was so moist and tender!  We were split on the cabbage.  He thought it was very good, but I couldn't even eat it.  I won't be making this recipe again though.

Loved it! The one thing I can recommend Is to leave out the outer leaves of the cabbage. That part came out chewy. I I didnt have pork chops so I used country style ribs. Very tender and flavorful. One of my favorite recipes so far. Will make again!!

Both the cabbage and the chops had good flavor, but my pork chops turned out dry. Also, some of the cabbage burned to the bottom of the pan even though I used oil.
