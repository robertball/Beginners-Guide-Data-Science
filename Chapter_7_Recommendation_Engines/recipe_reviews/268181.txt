I really loved this and so did my hubby & 6yo (for whom I made a g-rated version). For my daughter I omitted the Bailey's and added 1/4tsp real sugar to her 16 oz mug before pouring over the hot cocoa mixture. I absolutely adored the added almond flavor from the almande - hubby prefers regular Bailey's but he's wrong ;) I would absolutely make this again & have recommended it to friends as a lower-calorie, more easily drinkable (not too rich) version of hot cocoa for parties!

This is a good alternative for someone that cannot have dairy. I will admit, it is not very sweet. The whipped cream and sliced almonds really add to it. I don't see why a little sweetener or dairy free marshmallow cannot be added. This drink served along with another Bailey Almande hot chocolate recipe, posted by Baileys, with dark chocolate and marshmallow was well received for something different. Experiment with the hot chocolates. This is a great liqueur as any made by Baileys.

Unfortunately we weren't a big fan of  this recipe.  I really like the Baileys Almonde, but, this didn't taste like a hot chocolate to my family.  It had a very light chocolate flavor and was slightly bitter and not sweet enough for us.

This was good but I really wanted a little more of the Baileys flavor in the drink.  For me this would be a great after-brunch drink in the cold of winter.  I maybe would have liked just the Baileys Almande heated with whipped cream on the top all by itself.  Still, it is a wonderful option for a change.  I appreciate the idea of it!  Thanks, Baileys!
