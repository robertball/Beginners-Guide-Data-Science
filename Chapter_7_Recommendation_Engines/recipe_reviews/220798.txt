THIS RECIPE ROCKS !! HANDS DOWN DELISH !!  Light, fluffy,so amazingly good. ! No need for frosting, they are that good. But  I made the frosting for kids and tinted the frosting different colors and added choc. chips, yum !  I did not use the cones, filled cupcake tin about 1/2 way. Had no buttermilk, so I substituted 1/4 cup milk + 1/2 teas. white vinegar and let it sit for a few minutes before adding. Don't be alarmed that mixture is thin. I thought I didn't follow recipe correctly but they came out PERFECT ! THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER !!! Try it, you'll be glad you did !!
