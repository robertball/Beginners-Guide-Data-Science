Excellent!  The only change I made was to add 2 Tbsp. corn syrup to the ganache after I removed it from the heat.  The frosting was creamy, smooth, and shiny...just what I was looking for. When it's chilled it tastes like the filling in a truffle.

How wicked is this!! melted chocolate in microwave, then added butter and cream last.  Used freshly brewed coffee with teaspoon of sugar to balance the bitterness instead of alcohol. I bought dark chocolate with 70% coco content. Very easy to do...

DELICIOUS rich and chocolately, and sooo easy to make! I made mine w/o the brandy as it was for a cake for my mom, and she hates alcohol. Still tasted great!

Excellent consistency.  I do not like bittersweet chocolate so I used semisweet because my husband likes the semi.  Not a fan of semisweet either.  It was ok for me but he loved it.  Next time I'm going to use Milk Chocolate for a sweeter flavor.  I did not use the liquor as I do not like that flavor.

This was good. I used it to ice a dark chocolate cake. I used Kahlua instead of brandy. The directions are easier than a "gourmet" recipe, but it did the job. Maybe a little too bitter for me...

Rich and Delicious!  I added 2 tbsp of light corn syrup when I removed it from the heat as suggested by another reviewer and used Frangelico because I did not have any brandy.  I used this on the Cream Filled Cupcakes from this site.  I can't wait to use it again with other recipes.

I tried this recipe and wound up having to add about 3/4 box of confectioner's sugar in order to achieve an icing-like consistency.  That said, I love the smooth texture and the taste is great.  I didn't have brandy, so I used Godiva chocolate liqueur and Grand Marnier.  Yummy!

this is my favorite icing ever!  you can use it on so many things!  it went incredibly well on jan's chocolate cake.  i used amaretto instead of brandy, which turned out delicious, and you can pretty much substitute any licquor.  highly recommended.

I made half a recipe, using semi-sweet chocolate chips and without brandy, to drizzle on a chocolate cake.  It did the job perfectly.  I don't think I would have liked the brandy here, particularly the rather large amount of it...

I made a large rectangular cake,, so I was worried that there wouldn't be enough icing - there was plenty! This is fantastic stuff! I made it in the microwave in less than two minutes.

I knocked off a star because I had to tweak the technique a bit to get it to come out right. I brought the butter and heavy cream to a boil, then took it off the heat and added the chocolate, letting the heat from the cream melt the chocolate gently, and then added Kaluha instead of brandy. Since I was frosting a layer cake, I let the ganache cool, then refrigerated it. Then I whipped it in my stand mixer to make a light, fluffy frosting. Then I didn't have enough to cover my cake! I had to make a second batch, but didn't have time to cool it again, so I used the fluffy frosting to fill the middle of the cake, the poured the warm ganache over the whole thing. The good news is after all that work, it turned out DELICIOUS.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've used it several times with the black bottom cupcake recipe and also with Sandy's chocolate cake (baked as a sheet cake)recipe both on this website. Let it cool well before using because it runs more when it's still warm.

I found this recipe easy to follow but it is important to allow the icing to cool a little before spreading it between and on the cake otherwise it will spill all over the place.  The taste was quite potent of the alcohol which was brandy in my case.  After a few days the tast of the icing was better and definitely added to the cake.  I was MOST pleased as well as my husband and family. 

Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Yummy!  I used Dove Dark Chocolate and left out the Brandy.  If you don't love dark chocolate I would recommend using half dark half milk chocolate to cut the bitterness.

This is so easy to make. I used it on the Baked Doughnuts. I just dipped the doughnuts in the icing and set them on a baking sheet to set. I used semi sweet chocolate and it was just right.

So easy - took 3 minutes to make. No chopping chocolate, etc. Was perfect. Put in fridge for a bit to cool down and it iced the cake beautifully. Perfect amount for a double layer round cake.

Wow, wow, wow! My first time making chocolate ganache. I melted butter and heavy whipping cream on stove top until boiled and poured onto chocolate shavings in a stainless steel bowl and let sit like that for 3-5 minutes and then I mixed with a whisk. I will add a photo soon, fantastic recipe. I used this on the chocolate cake I recipe from this site.

omg, this was soooo good.  it was my first time making ganache, but it was so easy and tasted so rich and sophisticated.  I used Nestle's  Chocolatier bittersweet chocolate chips and didn't add any sugar (personal preference).

A great recipe--I did not use the brandy, and it was wonderful.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips, as that's all I had on hand.  Used it to drizzle on top of Chocolate Pound Cake III from this site (unbelievable!), and served some in a separate bowl for ice cream topping.  An amazing addition to an already amazing cake.

I never made ganache before. This was easy to make, delicious to eat, beautiful to look at and it really impressed my friends! I also added 2 T of corn syrup in the hopes it would be shiny. It was shiny and had the perfect consistency. I topped the New York Cheesecake III with it and I will never do it another way.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked in a saucepan over low heat.  I then cooled the icing in the refrigerator for about 30 min until it was thicker and spread it on vanilla cupcakes (from a mix) like a regular icing.  It offset the very sweet cupcake nicely!

Decadent.  Perfect for anything needing a serious chocolate blanket.  Tasted yummy w/out brandy.  Don't do alcohol.  Beware of a spoon with this stuff on it.  =)

The ganache had quite a kick to it with the amount of Brandy called for. In my opinion 2 would be better than 3 ;) But it was as rich as I had expected! Delicious overall!

Good recipe- I added a splash of coffee which adds a depth of flavor to the chocolate, used it with a french vanilla cake mix, and put chopped walnuts on the top. Very easy and very good!

Yummy! I could eat by the spoonfuls!

Used a double boiler and only milk chocolate. Didn't add any sugar and the ganache was heavenly! Definitely let it cool before you use on a dessert. Used it on my "Fauxtess" cupcakes and it was excellent! Didn't use any brandy and it turned out perfect! Oh but I did add about 2 tbls light corn syrup as onther reviewer suggested. This is a keep and so quick and simple to make!!

If you are a fan of dark chocolate, this icing is heavenly!  I accidentally used unsweetened chocolate and added a little over a half cup of sugar to make up for it (any less and it was much too bitter).  It is by no means overly sweet, very very rich and dark.  I melted this all in a makeshift double boiler (oven-safe bowl floating in boiling pan of water), took a while but came out very creamy.  Decadent!

I halved the recipe and, out of personal preference, heeded the comment of the previous reviewer (Robbie Rice) and used mostly semi-sweet chocolate and a small amount of bittersweet. In place of the brandy, I used chocolate liqueur and vanilla. Like LadyJayPee I made it for the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake. Nice body & sheen--great & easy recipe.

I made slot of changes to this. 1. Used semi sweet instead of bitter sweet. 2 added 2 tbs of corn syrup at the end so it looks nice and glossy. 3. This recipe is way to thin when followed just as directed. I had to add powdered sugar until it was thick enough to even spread. Even then it's not thick like butterflies, more like a syrup. Put it in the fridge to thicken up a but, then just pour it over the cake and let harden. I don't see how other people don't comment on how thin this is. Anyway, the flavor is great, the consistency is not.

Very nice consistency, smooth and velvetee. I think it calls for a little too much butter, I had to drained it when it was done. Otherwise, a perfect ganache...Thanks for sharing! Monica

I didn't use the brandy, and I think I used semisweet chocolate because I don't like bitter, but it worked well and tasted good. I added a little corn syrup to it, and I think without that, it wouldn't have been as pretty/shiny.

This was fantastic although I ended up needing a thicker frosting because my cake broke so I let it cool a bit and beat in a package of cream cheese and 3/4 cup powdered sugar.

Any kind of liqueur works in this recipe.  I prefer Kahlua.  Rich and decadent.  So much better than a sweet icing sugar laden frosting.  I used it to top the fabulous Black Magic Cake from this site.

I made a few changes, but it worked out really well in a pinch.  I used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract instead of the brandy.  Heated the milk, butter, and extract in the microwave, then added semi-sweet chocolate chips & let sit to melt.  It took a lot of stirring to melt the chips fully, but that's  because of the stabilizers in chocolate chips.  Let cool until spreadable & used for a 2 layer cake. Yum!

I made this ganache for the first time when I made "Jan's Chocolate Cake," (also for the first time).  This was a HUGE HIT!  I used dark chocolate w/Kahlua to go in between the layers and I used semisweet chocolate w/Godiva Chocolate Liqueur for the icing on the top/sides.  It's been 3 days and I'm still getting emails from friends raving on how good the cake was.  This is a keeper!

Very good, I didn't think it added much to a dessert, but it certainly didn't take away either. The second time I made it I added some vanilla and that made it more flavorful

Delicious and easy to make.  Thank you for this recipe.  I used it on the Apple Cake III recipe on this site. Everyone loved it. (Added Khalua instead of Brandy, used semi-sweet chocoloate and only used half of the sugar recipe)

Made as recipe is written, in a double boiler, with exception of replacing brandy with kahlua to go with the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake on this website.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I substituted soymilk since I had no cream, but still, it was absolutely divine! I put it on a yellow cake and it reminded me of Entenmann's "Rich Chocolate Frosted Donuts." Very tasty!!!

I took the advice of adding 1.5 Tbsp of corn syrup & replacing the brandy with coffee w/1 tsp sugar. I put all ingredients(softened butter) minus the heavy cream into a bowl. I boiled the heavy cream and poured over. Let sit for a minute then stirred till well combined & then refrigerated before using for 30 min. I think if I refrigerated longer, I may have had a less viscous ganache. This seemed more of a glaze. But tasty nonetheless.

My first ganache! I didn't have any brandy but it turned out just fine in any case. I also made it half milk chocolate. I didn't get it quite as thick as I wanted but I'm sure that's just because of my inexperience. It still looks and tastes fantastic!

I thought this recipe was fool proof because of all the great reviews.  I followed it EXACTLY.  I did use a double boiler, but that shouldn't have made a difference.  There is this creamy condensation looking film on it.  It was fine when I put it in the fridge last night.  Maybe it shouldn't go in the fridge?

Excellent ganache - better than the cake itself!  I also added some vanilla essence, and used half dark and half milk chocolate.  I can't imagine making it without the brandy - it adds extra depth and interest.  Next time I might try orange brandy.

Apparently I did something wrong.  I put everything together and when it was finished the butter separated so bad I think I may have to put powder sugar in it to save it.  I don't think I will be using this one again.  I did follow the instructions exactly.

Delicious.  I used it to ice the 'Extreme Chocolate Cake' by Rachel, which I filled with a dark chocolate mousse recipe I had from another source.  The cake was soooo good (if I say so myself).

This was great I used it to cover a yellow cake and dipped the tops of mini cupcakes in. I omitted the brandy and did the cooking in the microwave and was shiny and beautiful in like 45 seconds. I think I might want to try and dip cookies in it.

I've made this twice now, though each time I made a third of a recipe.  The taste is fantastic. I used Guittard extra dark chocolate chips and substituted orange juice concentrate for the brandy, as I don't consume alcohol. I used them on cream puffs filled with orange mousse and they were great. The reason I took off one star is because the texture is not very icing-ish. It will not drizzle from a bowl. Even when put in a plastic bag with the corner cut off it was kind of blobby when squeezed out. Next time I will try adding a little corn syrup, as suggested by another reviewer.

I iced a double chocolate Bundt cake with this icing.  I didn't have any brandy so I substituted Cream d Cocoa.  It came out great.  Love this not so sweet, dark chocolate icing.

Substituted black coffee for brandy and added a tablespoon of Jaegermeister and used  4 squares of unsweetened chocolate and 3 of semi sweet and it was too bitterr! Added some icing sugar. Tasted. Still too bitter. Added more. Perfect now. Noticing it separating. Now poured it on freshly made brownies. Seems to have separated. Not bad though. Maybe fat from butter or cream is rising to the top. Spoon tastes great!!!  I suspect the grandsons will love it this evening.

I'm not a big chocolate cake fan but my coworker loves chocolate cake so I decided to try out this recipe with the chocolate ganache icing. It was a huge hit at work and I loved it!! Super moist and delicious!! I followed the recipe as written but made a bunt cake and cooked it for 40 min. Came out perfect. I also used the chocolate ganache icing recipe but used 3 tbsp of coffee instead of brandy.

I never have confectioner's sugar on hand, so this recipe was a great find. I only had some baker's chocolate and a partial bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips so just estimated the amount of chocolate. I used the recommended amounts of cream and butter, then added some honey (instead of the corn syrup some users recommended). Didn't use the alcohol, although someone's suggestion of Kahlua sounds awesome. It came out creamy and beautiful.

I used 7oz semi sweet mini chocolate chips, 2T soften butter and microwaved 1/2C cream for 1 min on high. Pour cream over chocolate and butter mix until smooth... I have added alcohol or flavoring but just as good without... Thanks for the recipe!

OK, so I looove this recipe!  It has become a staple at all of our family gatherings.  I substituted vanilla extract for the brandy and used a combination of bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate and I get a slew of compliments.  I use this over a devil's food bundt cake and it's amazing!
