Love it!! My husband does not normally like sauces that are too creamy (such as the typical alfredo) however, the combination with the tomato basil sauce was just right even for him.  The sauteed onion, red bell pepper, garlic and celery added a wonderful texture and flavor.  We will make this again.  No adjustments necessary !!

Let me just say this was an incredible meal.  Both my kids had 2 HUGH bowls of this and was trying to lick lick there plate clean.  My daughter has now asked for this pasta dish for her birthday and she's trying to convince me to make enough for her birthday party.  Oh Boy.  This is definitely a meal I will be making often.  This is a must try.

Oh my gosh! This was sooo good! My fiancee and I loved this recipe. This will definately enter the dinner rotation. I did leave out the celery though.

this recipe was amazing! i substituted the bow tie pasta to make it easier to eat and it was delicious not to mention the presentation was beautiful.  i also cut up one medium size tomato and used green pepper instead of red for a nice color contrast.  it was simply delicious paired with a red wine and a basalmic salad.

This was amazing. I made a few modifications - not because the original recipe isn't good, I just tend to tinker. I used scallops and fake  instead of shrimp, green onion instead of regular, chopped oyster mushrooms, chopped spinach and omitted the celery and chicken broth. I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious! I added sliced mushrooms to it in addition to the written ingrediants. Whole family LOVED it. Even my picky 6 year old daughter finished a whole bowl full and told me I was the bestest cook!
