I often make congee (but not with fish, which is why I tried this recipe) and I'm a stickler for some things, so I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I didn't use chicken granules; I used sesame oil, corn starch, and white pepper to marinate and used the green onion and ginger as toppings instead. I didn't use as much water because I like it thicker, and it also took longer than 20 minutes to get the porridge to a consistency that I like. Also, I used fresh cod for the fish. A nice simple breakfast. Even though I made changes I think this is a good basic recipe. Note to other cooks: the ingredients say parsley but that means Chinese parsley AKA cilantro.
