pretty darn good. i used butter instead of margarine and increased it to 1 cup based on a previous reviewer's problems with crumbly dough. my cookies kept a rounded shape but it wasn't undesireable; reminded me of Mexican wedding cookies. the flavor is very nice.

The finished product came out tasting very lightly of jasmine and delicious. However the dough was extremely crumbly and hard to work with. I would also recommend flattening the cookies more before baking.

Just OK...The tea flavor did not come out much in theese. I did add more butter...uped it to 1cup. Will make again with more tae leaves to see if it add more flavor or will steam the leaves first to bring out the flavor better and puree them in the food prosessor.
