I give it a 5 star with these changes.  I only used 1 - 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, and 2 c. powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  It covered a 9 x 13 carrot cake perfectly.

Note:

You need to know that this cream cheese frosting is for the person that wants a REAL cream cheese taste, as if they were eating actual cheesecake. This is not a sweet, sweet, sugary frosting. This is a cream cheese blessing! Not the kind you find in the container in the grocery store. This is homemade, amazingly delicious, cream cheese frosting!

Oh my goodness, this is a simple and yummy recipe and only took 15 minutes in my mixer.  Make sure you start with room tempurature or softened butter and cream cheese.  It will make your life a million times easier.  I also followed the advice of the previous reviewers and added an extra 1 cup of sifted confectioners sugar because we like our frosting sweet.  I also doubled the vanilla extract for a more intense flavor.  I had no problems with the consistancy whatsoever.  Since my husband likes the white frosting and I like chocolate, this batch made enough so I could divide it up into 2 separate batches.  I just took out 1/2 of the batch and set it aside.  Then I added 1/3 cup of pure cocoa powder (not hot chocolate mix) to the remaining batch and mixed it some more.  We each frosted our own 1-layer 9" separate cakes and it was delicious both ways!  If you only have 1 cake, you might want to reduce the recipe by half.  Enjoy!

Great recipe!  I used a slightly different method:  beat softened cream cheese with vanilla until smooth, then add softened butter a little at time, beating until smooth.  Finally, add powdered sugar to taste (I usually use less than called for).  I found this method to give the best consistency.  I've used this frosting on sam's carrot cake and pumpkin gingerbread (both from this site) with great results!

This recipe has both an unusually high proportion of cheese and low proportion of sugar (IMO). I like the resulting flavor, but it isn’t for everyone. For a less 'in your face' cheese flavor, I halve the cream cheese (8 oz instead of 16),  add 1/4 cup of butter, and one more cup of powdered sugar. The final thickness tends to vary on several factors (brand/type/temperature of the cheese and butter) so I add milk/powdered-sugar to give me the 'spreadability' I want. I use this as a 'base' recipe for frosting many baked items, changing thickness and flavoring to suit my current use. It isn’t a decorator frosting for the real fancy stuff, but it isn’t meant to be.

This frosting could be eaten by the spoonful.  Thought it was a tiny bit too tangy, so I used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 2.  I used it to top a carrot cake, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I truly don't see how you can go wrong with this frosting.

It was the lesser amount of butter and sugar that made me curious to try this recipe over what I've been making since forever. I don't know how this would have held up on a layer cake as it would definitely need to be firmed up in the refrigerator first, but let me tell you, it was awesome on the carrot bars I made today, and would be great on any sheet-type cake.  Just lightly sweet and perfectly cream cheesy. Each recipe has its place, and I will make this again for any kind of bar or sheet cake needing a cream cheese frosting. Thanks for sharing your recipe Janni!

This was delicious!!!! I cut the recipe in half and it came out perfect. Also everytime I make homemade frosting, I always add a 1/2 cup of cool whip, it makes it so much fluffier, and yummy. It was awesome with this recipe, you should give it a try :)

Perfect frosting - exactly what I was looking for! I used this on a bundt carrot cake from a box, and it really made it special. I sieved the confectioners sugar to avoid lumps, and added it slowly, tasting at intervals until I was happy with the sweetness.  I also used kahlua (about 3 teaspoons) to flavor, which is sweet, so I cut back on the amount of sugar used.  I frosted all sides of the bundt cake and have plenty left over - my boyfriend was eating the icing with a spoon!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Important!!!  Guys, unlike regular sugar, powdered sugar acts like a curve in this recipe; it will make this recipe (and many others) MORE LIQUIDY the more you add. Once it is liquidy, you have to add a whole lot of sugar (or flour) to get it hard again. Weird, I know, but true. This is why people who are complaining about the consistency usually claim to have added a bit more sugar to it. If you want your consistency to be harder, then just add a bit less sugar, not more! Stop short of turning runny!!!  That been said, it is not a sweet frosting... more like cheesecake flavor, which is perfect for me and many people out there. I stopped adding sugar half a cup before the required amount and everything turned out perfect... not too sweet, very cheesy, and it will be awesome on my carrot cake.

I made two batches, one as directed which turned out too soft to pipe onto cupcakes. The second, I first whipped the butter and sugar well, then added the COLD cream cheese a piece at a time. The result was a delicious, thick pipeable cream cheese frosting. This method is the key!

Not a frosting, more like an icing.  Very runny after following the recipe exactly. Had to alter the end product to try and thicken it enough so it wouldn't run off my cupcakes.  I wish I would have read the reviews.  With such a high rating, I was expecting something much better.  Would use again if I needed a thin icing, but not as a frosting.

Confession - I MADE NO CHANGES TO THIS RECIPE AT ALL and found it to be the best cream cheese frosting I've ever made (why would you give a recipe 5 stars if you had to make changes to it?) Again, this is for the true cream cheese frosting lover, not too sweet and nice flavor.  Must make sure both cream cheese and butter is well softened (left mine sitting in the bowl for a couple hours before mixing).  Everyone loved it atop my red velvet cupcakes :)  Have added to the list of will certainly make again.

This frosting is excellent and I use it quite often now on different cakes, with small variations. Our family has a sweet tooth so the 2 cups of sugar don't really cut it for us, the frosting seems to taste more like cream cheese with that amount of sugar in. Therefore, I add one extra cup of sugar (so 3 cups instead of 2) and the frosting comes out just perfect for our taste! When we need chocolate frosting I simply add coco powder until I get the right taste and color.  I noticed that the consistency of this frosting depends very much on the cheese cream I use. I made this using Philadelphia cream cheese and the consistency was pretty good, I was able to decorate my cake with it (see my photo gallery). However, where we live, this brand is pretty expensive, so at one time, I tried a generic supermarket brand instead. The same frosting, with the same quantities of cheese, butter and sugar came out pretty runny, no way to decorate with it. It was fine for us because we had no guests coming over, so we ate the cake the way it was. But if I need this frosting to look good, I use more expensive brands and it turns out great. This is a no fail, super tasty and incredibly fast to make frosting and I highly recommend it. Just keep in mind that it is not stiff enough for any fancy cake decorating.

I use a very similar recipe - except I only use 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup more sugar, and a generous teaspoon of vanilla (can also use almond for a pleasantly different taste, if desired).  Turns out creamy and not toothachingly sweet - so you actually get to enjoy the flavors of the item being frosted.  Typically I used it for carrot cake, but I've also used this to top homemade cinnamon buns.

For those who complain about it being too thin - try refrigerating it for 30 minutes to an hour... it should firm up a bit.  Also, the cake (especially if frosting a two-layer cake) MUST be entirely cooled - otherwise the warmth from the cake will cause the frosting to *thin/melt*.  Using these tips, I've never had any problems!

This is probably the best frosting on this site! I made the chocolate version for the Black Magic Cake found on this site and added the full 1/2 cup of cocoa as suggested by the author. It was rich and decadent. I made and extra half recipe but since I ran out of cream cheese, I made the same recipe with mascarpone. The frosting turned out a bit grainy but tasted very decadent. I used it as the filling and piped rosettes with the cream cheese frosting. I'm still a novice when it comes to making frosting, but this time around I found that by using an electric mixer will whip more air into the frosting making it fluffy and spreadable/pipeable. I initially stirred the frosting with a wooden spoon and it had turned into a soupy mess. Rather than adding more confectioners' sugar, I then decided to whip it with the electric mixer and it did the trick. I also found that the longer you whip it (say, several minutes) the fluffier it becomes. I also found that it's best to let the butter come to room temp. by letting it sit on the counter for a while. I had originally softened it in the mircrowave only to have little butter flecks in the frosting. I let the batter sit for a while, rewhipped it again, and the butter flecks were gone. This is definitely the only frosting recipe that I will use in the future! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Janni!

Best cream cheese frosting I have made! My husband couldn't stop piping it into his mouth! I did have one person tell me that there was too mush vanilla but I don't think so. I added crushed glazed pecans that I made myself. I melted 2 cups sugar and 1/4 tsp salt on the stove and tossed the pecans in it. I transferred it to wax paper and when they cooled I crushed them in a plastic bag with a rolling pin and then mixed them into the frosting. YUMMY!!

Perfect, perfect, perfect!  Exact correct amount to frost 24 cupcakes, holds up wonderful and tastes amazing!  Thank you! UPDATE:  Made this into chocolate cream cheese frosting by adding about 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.  Frosted Dark Chocolate Cake II also from AR and WOW!  I love this frosting, it is just perfect, don't make any changes, just make it!

Loved it with the few minor changes based on a review below: 1 block of softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup of butter, 1&1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Preparation followed the original recipe. I only needed it to frost 2 dozen cupcakes and I did have about 1/3 cup left over. (Guess where that went?!) Tip for those of you having a problem with consistency: After preparing your frosting, refrigerate it for about a half an hour before stirring it and then spreading it over your baked good(s). If you need it to keep its form after that, you will have to refrigerate your frosted product. If it is too thick, let is stand at room temp before frosting. Good luck and happy baking!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I am a professional baker and have tried many cream cheese icing recipes; this one beats them all by far! At first I was skeptical because of how little sugar the recipe calls for, but it was perfect without any alterations! Not too sweet and perfect on cupcakes. I don't think this would work for decorating a cake, but for cupcakes, perfecto!

Best cream cheese frosting I've EVER tasted. And I hate, hate, hate most frosting in general. I had no problems with runniness at all; mine was perfectly textured as shown in the photograph.
I followed the advice to cream the butter, sugar and vanilla first, then add COLD cream cheese. I used the recipe's exact amounts of all ingredients.

This is the first time that I've rated a recipe this low.  I tried to make this frosting to go on my 9 year old daughter's birthday cake. It was a disaster! I was so happy that my cake came out beautiful...until I whipped up a batch of this frosting. I followed the recipe exactly as it is and I came out with something that resembled a cheesy sweet soup.  It tasted good, but nothing could save the texture. And I mean NOTHING. I tried adding more sugar, more butter, leaving it to firm in the fridge, mixing it more, mixing it less, etc. As a last resort, I added a bit of flour.  Only then was it firm enough not to slide right off the cake! But it still didn't come close to the firmness needed for piping or decoration. I ended up spreading it all over the cake, hoping it wouldn't melt right off, and getting out my trusty cake decorating gels to make it somewhat presentable. This would taste good on a cake if you planned on leaving it in the pan until you served it. Other than that, I was very disappointed with this recipe. I hope my daughter will still like her birthday cake.

Mmm, tastes great. I was looking for something to decorate my daughter's birthday cake (star tip, pastry bag kind of icing) but I don't like the traditional Buttercream that is made with lard. Ew! I tried this with Butter Pecan cake (Betty Crocker) and it was just fabulous! Held it's shape when piped onto the cake, everyone raved about it.

Perfect frosting for a banana cake I made. Really enjoyed the more "cream cheese" taste to it, rather than just creamy sweetness, as many other cream cheese frosting recipes yield. Cut recipe in half; perfect for a 9 x 13 sheet cake.

Excellent cream cheese frosting. The cream cheese taste comes through nicely. To ensure a smooth texture, the cream cheese and butter should be at room temperature prior to mixing.

I hate to review a recipe based on the modifications I've made but I figured I should share the changes to help others out.

I've never made this as is because reviewers said it comes out "too cream cheese-y" So here are the changes that make it sooo perfect:
use 1 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, and 2 c. powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

Very good! Frosted red velvet cupcakes with it- I used fat-free cream cheese, which made it too thin to decorate with, but still tasted great!  I recommend using either 1/3 less fat or full fat cream cheese to make this thick enough though :)

I will make this very creamy, spreadable frosting again...but will probably add a bit more powdered sugar to taste.  I chose this recipe because it looked to be less sweet with more of a cream cheese taste and I wasn't disspointed.  Good frosting that you can "tweak" to suit your taste!  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe on sugar cookies for Christmas.  I halved the recipe, but added a bit more sugar than it called for.  I was extremely disappointed.  It turned out to be a waste of time, money and decent cream cheese.  The taste was okay but not great.  It was also too runny, even with extra sugar.  I added mint flavoring to a third of it;  never, EVER try that!  It tastes disgusting.  No one in my family cared for this frosting at all!  I wouldn't recommend it for cookies, period!

Classic, but very good. You can still feel/taste the tanginess of the cream cheese, but it is not overpowering. Will not look further for another cream cheese frosting recipe. Haven't tried to put cocoa in mixture, as suggested by the submitter, but I will do someday.

This was amazing on carrot cupcakes and so quick and simple to make! Other than halving the recipe, I didn't change a thing. I love it because it's a true cream cheese flavor and it's not disgustingly sweet. I let my cream cheese and butter sit out to soften. At first my frosting wasn't very firm (I noticed that my frosting got thinner and thinner as mixed, either from the heat of the room or the heat and friction from mixing), but I chilled the frosting for a couple hours while my cupcakes finished baking and cooling and the texture was just perfect for spreading. 

If your frosting is coming out a little thin, my advice is: 
1. Don't microwave your butter or cream cheese to soften- let it soften at room temp. 
2. Don't over-mix it or take too long, as it'll get a little warmth in it and thin out. 
3. Stop adding all that sugar to firm up your frosting! It's an unnecessary frustration, it over-sweetens this perfectly balanced frosting, and did I mention calories yet? Just pop your frosting in the fridge for a while and walk away.

This is the BEST cream cheese frosting that I have ever made - and I have tried countless recipes looking for the perfect one.  This is the real deal in terms of cream cheese taste.  I made it exactly as it was written, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  I generously frosted a 13x9 and I still have more than a cup leftover (thinking of frosting a pumpkin bread with it!).  The sweetness is perfect - at least for our tastes.  On a side note….I’ve seen some of the pictures posted on this recipe, and I definitely suggest that you chill the frosting thoroughly before you try piping it onto cupcakes or cakes.  The heat generated from beating the frosting makes it less than ideal for using immediately if you’re planning on piping with it.  And of course - any cake frosted with it should remain refrigerated.  Enjoy! :)

Loved this frosting!  I used it to frost the Red Velvet Cake I from this site.  It had great consistency and texture and wasn't too sweet.  Changes:  I added an additional 3/4 cup of sifted powdered sugar because it was a little too tart with just the recipe amount.  I ended up having to make an additional half batch to have enough to frost between 4 layers, top and sides and have enough to decorate.  I used a little paste food coloring and piped red swirls on top and stuck in slivered almonds to make flowers.  It was a hit with the southerners!!

So, the taste was good but it was sooo runny I had no use for it :( I followed the recipe, I really don't know what others do different. Thankfully I had more butter and sugar at home so I made a buttercream really quick to save the day.

So, so good.  Not overly sweet, and very rich.  I added the zest of one lemon for a nice tang.  This recipe made more than I needed to frost a 9x13 sheet cake, so I ended up eating about a cup of frosting by itself!  Delicious!

I'm glad I tasted this frosting before putting it on the cakes.  The amount of cream cheese is WAY too much.  I doubled the rest of the ingredients, using 2 packages of cream cheese, 1 cup of butter, 4 cups of powdered sugar, and 2 tsp of vanilla, and then the frosting tasted perfect.  This frosting colored very nicely with Wilton's gel icing colors for writing on the cakes.  I did need to thicken it a bit to be able to pipe a shell border, but even with the extra-extra powdered sugar, the flavor was still nicely tangy.  I'll definitely use this recipe again, reducing the cream cheese amount by half.

Yum!!  Used this on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake, same method as RALWATTAR:  Beat softened cream cheese with vanilla until smooth, then add softened butter a little at time, beating until smooth. Finally, add powdered sugar.  I let this chill in the fridge until the cake was cool - still spread no problem.  I will use this recipe from now on.

I took the advice of another reviewer and adjusted the ingred as follows:  8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 1 t vanilla, 1.5 c powdered sugar.  Frosted a 9x13 carrot cake perfectly.  Tasted wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe because I was in a pinch. I made a sponge cake and didnt realize I was all out of confectioners sugars so this worked really well after I cut my cake in two.

Delicious! If I knew it was so easy to make my own cream cheese frosting, I'd have made my own all along. No more frosting in the tub for me.

The PERFECT cream cheese recipe.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  This is my master recipe for this - I don't change a thing, which is pretty uncommon.  Use this to frost "Moist Carrot Cake" from this site - will rival any gourmet bakery cake.

The best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted. Just like what you'd find on carrot cake at a very expensive restaurant. Consistancy is PERFECT, so easy to spread and frost. If you're having difficulties (too runny) make sure your butter is only slightly softened, FAR from melted or even margarine-like in consistency. I'll use nothing but this from now on!

This recipe was excellent. It didn't specify the type of butter so I used unsalted and added a pinch of salt. I also sifted the powdered sugar first. The first time I made it, I accidentally used half the butter listed but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The second time I made it, I used the correct amount of butter and found that I preferred it w/ less butter. I also thought this was pretty sweet so def. wouldn't add more sugar. I did need to refrigerate the frosting cause it got a little runny when warm. But it was simply divine on a red velvet cake. Highly recommended!

As written this frosting recipe would be great on a sheet cake or layer cake. When frosting cupcakes, I use a large star tip and like to get height with my frosting, and I found this to be a little too thin to hold up to those demands. By increasing the sugar to 2.5 cups I got the perfect fluffy consistency for frosting my red velvet cupcakes. I love that this cream cheese frosting actually tastes like cream cheese! :o)

This is delicious. I will never buy pre-made frosting again. I only used 1 (8oz) cream cheese but left everything else like the recipe calls for. Enough to cover 9x13.

This tasted fantastic, but it definitely needs to be blended (not stirred) with more milk for it to be spreadable.  I could eat this stuff by the spoonful though and had to convince myself that the cake needed the frosting more than my thighs did.

Just like my grandma makes!  Perfect cream cheese frosting every time.  Tip: If you want to use this to frost cupcakes bakery-style, add lots more powdered sugar until it's more stiff so that it can set.  Otherwise, it will look droopy on your cupcakes.  To balance out the sweetness, add a pinch of salt as you mix in the extra powdered sugar.

Very good frosting with a nice consistency...not too sweet. I put it on Hummingbird Cake I from this site and it was great together. 

You could do some simple borders or writing, etc..with this consistencey

This is an excellent recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. It really bugs me when people say something like "I give it a 5 star rating with these changes. Then proceeds to give exactly the same ingredients but changed the amount because she was making something smaller. That really bugs me

I used the 1 package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter softened (not melted) & two cups of powdered sugar, and vanilla. I used a beater & it was AMAZING! Put it on top of brownies, and they disappeared in a day. The frosting consistency was perfect! Don't melt the butter, use cold cream cheese, and use a beater.

I cut the cream cheese in half per other reviewer's recommendations, and I think that's a good move.  I still used almost two whole cups of con. sugar.  I didn't cut the butter in half, but certainly would next time.  We used this on the Pumpkin Cupcakes on this site, and everyone it.

This recipe is the wonderful, basic cream cheese frosting that I grew up with. My Mom did them for all of the family gathering cakes. However, this one doesn't have near enough powdered sugar for my taste. As is the cream cheese flavor is too strong. Doesn't really taste like frosting. But that is an easy fix. Just add more sugar!

It's nice albeit not what I was expecting. If you're wanting sweet, try a recipe with twice the powdered sugar. This one is very cream chees-y and to my taste, only slightly sweet.  It didn't pair well with my dense carrot cake, so I disagree with the description in that regard.  This isn't what I think of when I think of frosting, but I can certainly see how others might favour it. Thanks for sharing!

delicious, use a mixer.  I added a 2nd tsp of vanilla for flavor, as another reviewer suggested.  It has a cheesecake taste to it, very tasty.  Perfect for carrot cake, I recommend the Sam's Famous Carrot Cake also on this site.

This recipe is perfect as it is written. I started out making the suggested changes of 1 pkg of cream cheese and half the butter with 2 cups of confectioner's sugar-- but it was sickeningly sweet and I didn't think it was as cream-cheesy as I would like so I went ahead and added the rest of the cream cheese and butter and it turned out great! I used it on the Lite Carrot Cake recipe on this site and I had lots of leftover frosting. You could easily to a layer cake with it. But definitely keep the recipe as it is written, it's fantastic.

This frosting recipe is stellar! I made it with only 1 package of cream cheese, mostly because I wanted a more subtle taste.  It worked great on my pumpkin cupcakes. I prefer this over the store-bought brand any day!

Wonderful frosting! One change in order to keep it thick: mix the butter, sugar, and vanilla extract first. Then add the cream cheese. Worked great!

Its flavor wasnt the best. The cream cheese was overpowering. If you added more vanilla and less cheese it might have been better. Might try again.

yummy! I have made this just as written then I took Pabbydog's advice and used 1  8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 butter  1 1/2 vanilla and 2 C powdered sugar and then I used my wire wisk attachment on my mixer and whipped it up until it was light and fluffy.

It's perfect on Martha Stewart's pumpkin cupcakes!  It stiffens up in the fridge and it does need to be in the fridge or else it will go bad.  I don't think it needs 2 cups of sugar, that would be wayyyy to sweet.  It tastes like cheesecake!

Yummy!  I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 the cream cheese and 1/4 C. butter. I also added 2 tsp. vanilla and made sure that I sifted the powdered and added it slowly to prevent lumps. I used it to frost a lemon cake and sprinkled lemon zest on the top for pizzaz. I brought it to a family event and everyone raved about the frosting. Not too sweet and the cream cheese was not overpowering. This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is only for those who like a thick, not-too-sweet, cream cheese frosting that actually tastes like cream cheese. If you want sweet, look for another recipe. For me, this was absolutely perfect. My only problem is, should my frosted cake be refrigerated? I didn't, and I didn't store it well at all, and the frosting developed a weird texture.

I halved this recipe, and it was more than enough for a 9 X 13 cake. I added about 1/4 - 1/2 c more sugar and  a little cinnamon since it was for a pumpkin cake. It was a little thin so I refrigerated before frosting. This is SO delicious - thank you!

Started out with cream cheese and butter at room temperature, and spread it on a completely cooled cake... consistency was just right, I had no problems decorating the cake. If you like your frosting super-sweet, you could add more sugar, but I thought it was perfect as is. Made it with "Pat's Award Winning Carrot Cake" from this site and got rave reviews!! Made a two-layer 9-inch cake and had some leftover frosting.

I just used this frosting for a red velvet cake and I'm disappointed in the result.  I knew two boxes of cream cheese sounded like a lot of cream cheese and it was just too much.  It tastes like slightly sweetened cream cheese.  Maybe good for frosting other things, but not a cake.  The other "cream cheese frosting II" on this site calls for half the cream cheese and twice the vanilla and powdered sugar as this recipe (butter the same).  I should've used that one or something in between.

I didn't need much, so I cut the recipe in half, but didn't change the ingredients. INCREDIBLE. I cannot wait to try this on many, many things. I just put some on pumpkin cookies. However, the consistency was perfect for cake decorating (I want to try it!) - I did soften the butter first, creamed it with the powdered sugar and vanilla, and then beat in the cream cheese in cold chunks. Great tip! I seriously felt like I was eating cheesecake and could not resist eating spoonfuls. Thank you!

This frosting is very light everyone loves it for that reason. The trick to this frosting is in the beating .. The longer you cream the butter and sugar the lighter and fluffier it gets.  Definitely a keeper.

Too much cream cheese.  When I made it the first time, it felt like I was biting into a block of cream cheese.  It might be my personal taste because my mother on the other hand loved it.  I usually follow the tip from Pabbydog and it is delicious.

I have made this frosting 3 times now, always following the exact directions. I love it!!! I used it on chocolate fudge cupcakes, red velvet cupcakes and strawberry cupcakes. I took the red velvet to work for my supervisors birthday and my coworkers joked that I must have put crack in it because it was so addictive!!! I love it! Always perfect consistency to pipe onto cupcakes! I just use my whisk attachment for my mixer at the end to make the volume a little bigger and more fluffy.

Excellent real cream cheese flavor, just the right consistency - thin but not too thin - and just the right balance of sweet and tart. This is a great frosting/icing for carrot cake and will be my "go-to" cream cheese frosting from now on!  Also, unlike about 90% of everyone else who posts "reviews", I did not change a thing. That's what following a recipe is, folks. :)

This is the only cream cheese frosting recipe I use now! I have been making it for about a year, and usually only make 1/2 the recipe. Most of the time I just do the recipe exactly as written, but I have occasionally varied it successfully by adding things like cocoa, or lemon extract, or maple syrup/extract, or toasted coconut with coconut cream. Best as is, but still makes a great base for these other flavors as mentioned. Super easy and yummy!

Very Yummy. I didn't have two packages of cream cheese, so I had to make a half recipe. I'm putting it on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake, and I can't wait to try them together. So far, I've been trying to keep myself from eating all the frosting before the cake is cool enough to frost!

This calls for way too much cream cheese.  The icing ends up very runny.  I had to add a lot more sugar in order to get the right consistency.  The only other option would have been to refrigerate the icing for a few hours prior to icing then put it back in the fridge after icing the cupcakes.  I will not use this recipe again.

This was very delicious! I subbed ground sucanat sugar for half of the powdered and it gave it a wonderful light caramel flavor without an overwhelming sweetness. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was perfect. I see others saying that it was too sweet ... if that's the case, use less sugar. Duh, lol. Stiffness was perfect but it does give a LOT of frosting. If you don't need a whole lot, cut everything in half and you'll be fine.

Very delicious! After reading a few other reviews about it not being sweet enough, I had planned to add three cups of sugar but tasted it after two cups and found that it was perfect, plenty sweet - and believe me I like things sweet! Made this in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer and it came together wonderfully. Used it frost Carrot Cake XI from this site. The only almost-problem I had with it is that it doesn't make as much frosting as I thought it would (I know it says 3 cups but it's hard to imagine whether that's enough or not). I had just enough to fill and frost two 8-inch layers with a fairly thin layer of frosting - not enough left over to pipe borders.

This is my go-to frosting recipe.. I do usually end up adding a little extra sugar, and sticking it in the 'fridge for a while, but it's delicious and easy... and always a big hit at parties. ^_^

This tastes great! I added a little bit of extra powder sugar...like 1/2 cup. The only thing I didn't like about this was it's not very easy to decorate with. I'm used to butter cream and it's properties. So, for simple cakes with maybe just a rosette border it's wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly. This is great frosting for when you don't want something too sweet. You will need to refrigerate your cupcakes/cake after you frost them with this frosting, as it quickly gets a little too warm and melty after an hour or so.

WOW!  This is it!  Made this with the pumpkin sheet cake recipe on this site and it was a big hit.  I may be a little bias because I don't care for buttercream frosting but this is truely amazing!  It made a little bit more than needed but the kids enjoy it on a graham cracker later anyways so no worries there.  Thanks for the great recipe.

i've made this several times over the past few weeks and it is so delicious and so easy.  makes the perfect amount to frost a batch of cupcakes, i've been making mini pumpkin cupcakes and adding some cinnamon to the frosting and it's the best combination ever.    this is an easy recipe to add whatever flavoring you want, including chocolate!

Taste wise this frosting is right on point. As far as consistency this frosting SUCKS as is!!! It's too runny to put on cupcakes. I was getting VERY frustrated because I kept having to add powdered sugar and I still did not get the consistency of frosting. I'm refrigerating what I did not use overnight and I'll see how it comes out tomorrow morning. This recipe deserves a 2 but the taste is like no other so I give it an extra star. HEADS UP -Have at least 3-5 cups powdered sugar, additional.

Very good frosting, and mine turned out stiff like in the recipe photo after only being whipped for a short amount of time with a hand mixer. I halved the recipe, but I still used one teaspoon of vanilla, and put in 2 and 1/3 cups sugar. This is a good basic recipe, and went well with my red velvet cupcakes.

I loved this but I love cream cheese and I don't like overly sweet frostings.  I made it exactly as written.  I used it to frost my daugher's birthday cake and she and her friends loved it, too, even though both of her friends said they usually don't like frosting.  This frosting is VERY SOFT.  I would not try to frost a layer cake with it.  I made my cake in a 9x13 pan because, after reading the reviews, I knew it would be soft.  It also does not harden at all, even after being refrigerated overnight.  If you are looking for a sickly-sweet grocery store-type frosting, keep looking.  If you want a great cream cheese frosting, use this one.

Mmmm!  Wow, this is so good!  I did a half-batch to cover a carrot cake I made in a 10 by 15 jelly roll pan, and it covered it.  I really whipped it hard in my KitchenAid mixer, and didn't measure the 10X sugar, I just added until it was firm enough to hold shape to frost my cake. SO light and not too sweet.  I'm saving this one to use again.  Delicious.

Used this recipe for pumpkin cupcakes. Very good and simple. I whipped the frosting a little too long and it had an almost meringue consistency. It needs too kept cold to decorate properly. Once it starting getting close to room temperature it was hard to control and handle.

This has the consistency and flavor that cream cheese frosting should have.  I make this for my awesome carrot cake and it is enough to frost 3 layers, top, and sides, as well as adding a bit of decoration.  Simply the best recipe out there!

Delicious!  For someone (like me) who doesn't like icky-sweet frosting/icings, this was perfect!  Used it to frost the "Frosted Banana Bars" recipe on this site.  EVERYONE at work loved it! (I halved the recipe for what I was making and it was just enough)

I used this to frost an orange cake. I added a little lemon juice for a citrus taste. The cream cheese flavor comes through, which is good. It's not just a sweet frosting. The consistency is incredibly smooth and creamy and very spreadable. This would be perfect for a spicy carrot cake.

If you are looking to frost a cake stop and start over.  This is not the frosting for you.  I love cream cheese, cheesecake, and I like the flavor of this frosting BUT it's really reminiscent of cheesecake batter.  It's just too much and it's the kind of thing you only want a lick of (like cheesecake batter).  In addition to that the frosting is TOO RUNNY!  It was horrible.  I should have known it was too much cream cheese and not enough powdered sugar, I should have read the reviews.   The description specifically states it can be used for chocolate cake but unless you're baking in a 9x13 dish and have the edges of the dish to hold in the frosting, I would highly suggest finding another recipe more suitable.

The best!  I made as is, but halved the recipe.  More than enough for a 9 X 13 cake.  I used it to frost and eggnog cake.  Received rave review...  Another year later and still the best.  I just made my annual eggnog cake, used this glazed adding 3 Tbs of eggnog.  I tell you this is full-proof and be customized so easily!

This is a wonderful cream cheese frosting.  I used 1 box of confectioner's sugar to stiffen it up and then some orange peel to frost a chocolate cake.  YUM!

Don't even bother looking for another cream cheese frosting recipe - this is the only one you need.  Excellent!

Oh, my...this is sinfully good!  Far, far better the recipe I've been using for years.

One note...if halved, this recipe makes exactly enough to frost a 13 x 9 sheet cake - IF you don't "sample" too much of the it before putting it on the cake!

I read some of the review and I can easily help out if its the cream cheese that is lumpy, first make sure cream cheese is at room temp. then beat that up alone until smooth then add powdered sugar little at a time should help with that.

Absolutely Wonderful! I've now used this recipe to frost and layer numerous carrot cakes. My only trick is too let chill in the refridgerator 1/2 - 1 hour to firm up the spreading consistency.
Other than that it suits my taste well and you will have a little bit more to play with. 5 stars all the way!!

VERY yummy icing, I used this on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (also a WONDERFUL recipe) and the 2 complimented each over VERY well. It is VERY important to make sure the cream cheese and butter is soft before attempting to mix. I learned that the hard way and spend 30 minutes cleaning up after my mixer catastrophe. All in all a VERY yummy icing recipe.

Delicious!!  Just be sure the butter is SOFT before mixing or else you'll wind up with little butter lumps in it like I did.  Still tastes great but doesn't look as pretty.  I'll know better next time!

I doubled the vanilla in this recipe, added 1/3 cup powdered sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of (whipped) heavy whipping cream for the butter - sort of a variation from the "Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe. The frosting piped well when cold, but softened up whenever it was out of the fridge for long. Regardless, the taste was pure heaven. Delicious! The photos here look great, so I might try it with the butter next time.

Very good frosting that still has the tang of cream cheese to balance out the sweetness of whatever you're frosting.  I found the amount to be perfect to frost a two layer 9" round cake.

It was thick and very, very rich. I'm not sure why other reviewers had runny frosting, but mine was not at all runny. A bit too cream-cheesey for my taste. I am going to add more sugar next time. I also added a half-teaspoon of lemon and it was a nice touch. I used it on cinnamon rolls.

This is delicious!  I used it to decorate the "Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe on this website and it was perfect.  It was very creamy, but thick enough to hold it's shape when I wrote letters with it.  The recipe makes a lot, so now I'm going to make a carrot cake to use up the rest of the frosting.  I will be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

This frosting was great. I liked it so much I wanted to just eat it out of the bowl and say forget about putting it on the Best Carrot Cake Ever recipe found on this site. I licked the bowl and mixers clean.

I love this icing, I've made it several times and it is always a delight.  I do use confectioners sugar rather than regular sugar but that is the only change I make.  I would like to address an issue that may be the problem for some who have made this and had a problem with it not being stiff enough.  You must use Heavy cream, not whipping cream.  There is a difference between the two.  Heavy cream or it may be called heavy whipping cream has more butter fat in it, at least 36% and hopefully 40% or more.  It is that extra butter fat in the cream that makes good whipped cream for desserts.  Another thing that I do when whipping the cream is put a bowl inside of a larger bowl into which I have put ice.  That keeps the bowl very cold when whipping the cream. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form, but does not taste buttery. It won't take long.  Then whip the cream cheese sugar mixture, while the whipped cream is still sitting in the bowl that is sitting on the ice.  After whipping the cream cheese, lighten it up with a large spoonful of the whipped cream before folding in the rest of the whipped cream.

I tried this recipe today. What a disaster. It should only be one package of 250mL of cream cheese if that. The butter should probably be about half as well. I kept adding and adding sugar. Went back to the internet and found out why. Too much cream cheese. 
My advice to people - always look at the comments. They help!!!

This is incredibly delicious, and my husband says it's the best frosting he has ever had.  I used it on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (recipe on this site), and it was just perfect.  It was easy to spread,  and I had plenty to frost a 2 layer round cake.  I have no idea what those who complain about a soupy or runny texture did when they made it.  I can only assume that they used butter and cream cheese that was too melted or soft.  I used mine straight from the fridge and had no issues whatsoever.  I also followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I both loved it, and we see no need for any modifications.  Thanks for giving us such a wonderful recipe! :)

It's a dessert on its own. Used it as-is on pumpkin cupcakes (these went fast). Added lemon for lemon cupcakes. Will play with the recipe to make it more of a stand-alone dessert.

Yum! followed the recipe as written to frost Sam's Famous Carrot Cake from this site, which I made into cupcakes. Everybody just loved them. I prefer a cream cheese frosting that is not overly sweet, and this is it.

This is a great recipe if you like a really cream cheesy flavor. My husband, who isn't really into icing loved it because it wasn't too sweet. I did; however, find another recipe for cream cheese icing that is much better for cake decorating. I was looking for a recipe that I could ice a cake a lay fondant over. For a more firm and even tastier version of this add a 1/2 cup of shortening, 1 tsp salt and use the entire 2LB bag of confectioners sugar. You won't regret it!!

Used this frosting on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake. We think the recipe is fine if wanting a powerful cream cheesy flavor but a bit over the top for us by drowning out the flavor of the carrot cake. Used Publix brand regular cream cheese and experienced no problems as some indicated would happen if not using a name brand like ‘Philadelphia’. The frosting had a nice consistency, and easy to spread. I would not hesitate to use this recipe again but would only use 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese just as a good number of reviewers said they do.

I really liked this recipe.
I use it each time i make chocolate cake.
I like that its sweet but not like all sugar
i like the smooth texture because i can easily ice a cake
then refrigerate it and it will have a sturdy texture.

Amazing! Perfectly tangy and rich. I've gotten slightly fluffier results when I whip the butter, sugar and vanilla together first, then add the butter/sugar mix to thoroughly beaten cream cheese.  [Note: You really need to use the classic 'brick' style cream cheese. Not the loose, spreadable stuff you put on your bagels. There's far too much water in it, and your frosting will be soup.]

I needed something quick to throw on a carrot cake I had taken out of the freezer for dessert, so I whipped this up. It's delish!! I probably used 2.5 cups of powdered sugar because I wasn't going to put that little bit that was left in the bag back in the cabinet. It was soft and very spreadable, without being runny, like another poster said. Next time, I will substitute some DaVinci caramel syrup for the vanilla. I know it will be awesome!!

Best cream cheese frosting I've ever made or had.  I made it for Sam's Famous Carrot Cake and it was perfect for that.  This would also be good on red velvet cake.  I will be making this anytime I need cream cheese frosting!

This is absolutely fantastic! Needed a frosting for an apple spice cake. I didn't want anything too sweet, but with just the right touch. This was easy to make, not too sweet, and had a wonderful flavor. Perfect.

Made two batches, the first one came out too liquidy, I think the butter and/or cream cheese was too warm when mixing.  I looked through the previous comments and creamed the butter and sugar together (using hands to mix), then added STRAIGHT FROM THE FRIDGE cream cheese.  Came out perfect and stiff enough to use one of those icing decorating thingies (no idea what they're called).  LOVE this, but make sure you mix it right or it will be too liquidy.

Make this for the first time and loved it.  I have been looking for a real cream cheese icing and now I have found it. We like the tangy taste of the cream cheese this is why it is called cream cheese icing. I did take the advise of some of the comments and creamed the sugar and butter first and then added the cream cheese and it came out smooth.  Will make this again.

I tried the recipe as is but the frosting had too much of a cream cheese taste so I added an extra cup of icing sugar.  The next time I tried it I used the first reviewers changes (1 cream cheese box, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups icing sugar and 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla).  I liked both but preferred the second recipe a little better.

Used the frosting on "Strawberry Cake From Scratch" cupcakes. It was to die for. My granddaughter said it was like cheesecake on top of a cupcake which is definitely a good thing.  This will be my go-to cream cheese frosting recipe from now on.

Excellent flavor, only thing I'd change would be to add a little more sugar and a little less cream cheese, it was a bit more "cheesecake" flavored than it was an icing, but that's just my 2 cents worth. I liked it as is, but will try to change it next time.

I halved the recipe because I only had 1 package of cream cheese, had to add 4 cups of icing sugar to get it thick enough to frost my cake, the icing was quite sweet then so I added a squirt of lemon juice to counter

I'm giving this 2 stars only because it really does taste great, HOWEVER.. frosting IS supposed to stay on a cake! This just melts right off the sides despite my best efforts to keep everything chilled as best I could. I followed the recipe exact, without changing a thing. I've never made cream cheese frosting before now, but I will definitely be trying another recipe next time. If you are just going to frost a sheet cake, this may work better for you, but you are trying to do a layered cake like I did, you may want to keep searching.

This is a great, rich cream cheese frosting. I usually find most recipes way too sweet and the main flavor that really comes through is the sugar.This has more depth, and meets a more sophistacted palate, IMO. I think of sugar as an element to bring out other flavors, rather than masking them.

Absolutely delicious! No changes necessary! It is very cream cheesy, but this is the way I like it, so if you do like your cream cheese icing more sweet, you might add more sugar. I added a tad bit more vanilla, just because I like vanilla. =) Also try adding other flavor extracts for a change (like orange. :) 
I used this for carrot cake and a good tip that my boyfriend really liked was sprinkling heath bar bits (you can buy them in a bag next to the chocolate chips in the cooking aisle) over the top of the icing.

Excellent!  I followed a reviewers suggestion and cut the cream cheese and butter in half and still used the 2 cups sugar.  I also added another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm not sure how it would taste exactly as written, but I wanted to frost a 9x13 pan and this reviewer said it was the perfect amount for that.  They were right!

Wonderful frosting. We made it this Christmas for our carrot cake. Both were new recipes and at first we were skeptical. Recently moved and lost our family cookbooks in the mess and didn't have them available for the Holiday Season. This frosting was not overly sweet like some cream cheese frostings, it had a bit of tartness that made it just perfect. Our carrot cake had pieces of pineapple in it as well as the carrots, and it paired wonderfully with the frosting.

Literally just finished frosting my cake and this frosting is delicious!!!
As other's recommended, I halved the recipe for a 9x13 pan and I still had a couple of TBS left to nibble on :)
Highly recommend!!! 
Also, I did not sift the powdered sugar and still turned out very well

I substituted cream cheese with low fat cream cheese and found that it tasted just as good, but the frosting fell apart. For future reference, just stick with the original recipe.

I love cream cheese frosting and this one was very good. I'm giving it 4/5 stars though because I found that it called for a bit more powdered sugar. I used 2.5 cups instead of 2. I think even 3 would have been okay. I used it on a carrot cake and it was delicious.

I am a complete novice at making icing, but this turned out perfectly. I only used 1 package of cream cheese and there was still a ton of icing for the 2 dozen cupcakes I made. Everyone loved it and I'd make it again.

Need an amazing cream cheese frosting recipe?  This is it...oh my heavenly goodness.  I made this for a spice cake and shamelessly cleaned out the bowl with a spoon when I was done frosting it.  SO easy and SO good...I will never get store bought again.

I cut the recipe in half because it makes a lot more frosting than I like but I forgot to cup the butter in half.  So I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of cream cheese, but the frosting still turned out really good.  It wasn't extremely heavy in the taste of cream cheese which I know some people don't like.

This was good.  Definitely not too tangy as some described. I think it was on the sweet side.  Also - I mistakenly took some of the reviewer's advice that 1/2 recipe would be enough for a 13 x 9.  It did cover my 13 x 9 cake, but it was a thin layer.  For frosting lovers like me, go with th full recipe.

Everyone loved this frosting! I was a little worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough, but it was perfect, creamy and rich. I made 1/2 recipe, which was just right for a 13 x 9 pan of pumpkin bars. I will be using this recipe again.

Ooooooweeeeee! This was the perfect frosting to top my pumpkin bread! It was not to sweet (my hubby doesn't like really sweet frosting). I didn't change a single thing except the serving size. I did it for 10 serving, rather than 24. Made just enough for my bread. I will definitely be saving this simple and quick recipe...thanks for sharing Jani!

This is the perfect cream cheese frosting for carrot cake.  I don't like an overly-sweet frosting, so this is the perfect one--in my opinion.  I like the cream cheese flavor to be strong, and if you add more sugar, you get a sweet and less cream cheese flavor.

This was a wonderful frosting. It was hard to keep my kids from sticking their fingers in it. I used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of white sugar because I didn't have enough confectioners, it was still amazing. Just remember when using regular sugar you need to mix it well and give time for the granuals to be dissolved. As I am sure most of you know, make sure everything is room temperature before mixing. I will be making this often . Thank you

Best frosting EVER. I had no problems with consistency, but I followed the directions exactly. It's not too sweet and doesn't lose the cream cheese flavor, which is what I prefer.

Delicious! I don't usually like icing but this is incredible, really does taste like a creamy cheesecake.  Made this to top red velvet cupcakes for a friend's birthday, I actually licked the bowl!  I followed the recipe but doubled the vanilla extract, I can't wait for the guests to taste this frosting!

The best cream cheese frosting. I halve the recipe and use it for red velvet, carrot, and coconut cupcakes. I even add a few teaspoons of maple syrup and use it for maple cupcakes!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!!!! Not too sweet or anything. I used this on Lemon Cupcakes  and added some lemon juice. It was great!! THe only bad thing there is to say about this frosting is that its a bit runnny. I'm not sure whether this was because of the 2 droplets of lemon juice i added, but anyway! GREAT RECIPE

totally loved this recipe! I did only use one 8 ounce cream cheese, 1/4 butter, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 2 cups Confectioners sugar as suggested by PABBYDOG and it was So good! it was just right, not too sweet and does not even come CLOSE to the store bought frostings! Homemade is the way to go! I will be using this recipe A LOT!

This frosting is amazing!  I made this to top Greek Lemon Cake (recipe from this site) cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party, and I loved how nice and creamy the frosting was without being dense.  I also appreciated that it was such a good consistency for piping.  I am going to use this frosting again for my other daughter's birthday this weekend, but am going to add a drizzle of homemade raspberry syrup (strained liquid from boiled down raspberries) over dark chocolate cupcakes.  I expect to use this frosting recipe a LOT!

This is a great recipe! As other reviewers have said, it's the real deal.

I accidentaly made the following adjustments:
1.  Once, I made it with 4 c sugar, which yielded a stiffer frosting (which I liked), without sacrificing the cream cheese tang.
2. I also once made it with 1 package cream cheese and 3 c sugar...also good.  Not quite as tangy as with 2 pkgs cream cheese (no brainer).

In other words, you really can't mess this up, no matter what you do with this recipe!

This is a great tasting cream cheese frosting.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of powdered sugar for sweetness. This is a great cake cover, but NOT good for piping. Too soft. But as an over all frosting, it's delicious.

Delicious! Used only 1 8 oz package of cream cheese and 1/4 cup butter 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. Made with sams famous carrot cake from this site-so yummy!

This recipe was a little runny as others have said. I believe that is because it doesn't call for as much powdered sugar as some other recipes. That is a minor payoff for a much less "too sweet" frosting. I liked that you tasted more of the cream cheese. Very good!!

Definitely runny! Takes great though, and I'm putting it in the fridge before I frost my cupcakes in the hopes that it'll thicken. Agree with the last reviewer that it should be called icing and not frosting. It's very yummy though!

Terrific!!

My family loves this recipe as it is. I do however on occasion substitute half of the cream cheese with 8 oz of sour cream instead. It is just as rich, spreads smoother, but not quite so sweet. My version has gone well with spice, carrot, and chocolate fudge cakes

Love this! Perfect balance of cream cheese and sugar. You can tell it's a cream cheese frosting because of the thickness...and just a little from the flavor. Super easy to throw together, I put a little red food coloring for V-Day cupcakes...everyone loved! I made it for about 30 cupcakes...and still had enough for about ten more. I would guess that if you halved the recipe, you'd have plenty for a whole cake or 2 dozen cupcakes. Thanks for this awesome, creamy sweet frosting!

This frosting is for those who truly like a  rich cream cheese taste. It is creamy, flavorful, and delicious. I add 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract as per our families taste. It is our favorite frosting for pumpkin muffins. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

I don't typically review on here since I tend to forget too, but I almost had to make sure to leave one for this. Amazing frosting and super easy! I would consider myself an average cook and my baking is NOT my specialty. Go by the book on this recipe! I tried taking the advice of adding an extra cup of sugar, and I did not like it as much. I tried it before hand and thought mmmm absolutely delicious but then decided to see if it was possible to make even better with more sugar. I only added 1/4 maybe 1/2 extra cup of sugar but had preferred it beforehand. It didn't ruin the frosting by any means, I just personally LOVE real tasting cream cheese frosting and not the SUPER sweet frosting. Either way I am so proud I was able to make the best tasting frosting I've had in a loooooooong time.

Excellent. I will never buy cream cheese frosting in a can again. I did halve the recipe, including the sugar. I see many halved the cream cheese and butter but not the sugar. I thought it was fantastic. I wanted a cream cheese frosting, and that is what I got. Just enough sweetness with 1 cup of sugar and great cream cheese flavor. I frosted pumpkin spice cupcakes with this recipe.

This is a wonderful frosting! I followed others' advice and made the smaller quantity which was just right for 24 cupcakes.  The frosting has a beautiful satin appearance and it is not a sweet, sugar frosting.  It compliments the baked good and does not detract from it with a sugar taste.

This is a yummy frosting... EXCEPT:  I followed the directions given precisely and ended up with a cream cheese soup.  Added more powdered sugar... and more... and more... until I'd used an entire 2 lb package - And it's STILL soupy! At this moment, there is cream cheese frosting dribbling out from between the layers of a 4-layer red velvet cake on my kitchen table!  At least it's tasty!

This recipe was GREAT!!  The only difference for me, was that we used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, instead of 2.  It turned out perfect!!!!  As for the people who say it was too runny, I'm sure they are doing something wrong, because mine was not runny at all.  Maybe they used the tub of cream cheese instead of the blocks?  Mine was perfect consistency.

I thought that I'd clear up some of the problems people were having before about the frosting being too runny. If you melt the butter completely, this recipe will not work. It just needs to be room temperature. In fact, I let the butter and the cream cheese sit out for about 10 minutes on top of the oven while the cake was cooking and it came out to be the perfect consistency. So much better than store bought, I will probably never buy canned frosting again. Amazing and highly recommended!

The measurements are WAY off!! Made this according to recipe and I had a gooey mess that wouldn't even stick to the cake just kept running off the sides. I would cut the amount of cream cheese to 8oz, 1/4 stick of butter and increase sugar to 3 cups.

Great tasting frosting.  Not sure if I'm missing something here, but if you make the recipe just as described, (without knowing additional tips or tricks), you will get a frosting of VERY runny consistency.  It tasted great on my carrot cake, and luckily I made it in a 9X13 pan.  It ran all over the place, but managed to stay put on the sides of the pan.

This recipe is really good. I though it had just the right amount of sweetness, but one of the ladies I work with that doesn't eat a lot of sweets said she would perfer it have less sugar.  So, next time I may not add the entire two cups.  It's not a runny recipe.  It's the perfect consistancy.  You must use confectioners (powdered) sugar.  Not only was this recipe good, but it was easy.  Others recipes I found had too many ingredients and I'm no professional cook, so I just want simple, good recipes and this one is.

Great recipe, very easy to pipe even with just a Ziploc bag. If you want your frosting to be white make sure you don't use a really yellow butter!

I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty enough for a 13x9 inch cake.  I also added a bit more vanilla extract and included cinnamon in the frosting.  Lastly, I put chopped pecans on top.

This frosting is perfection if you love cream cheese. If you like a super sweet, really stiff frosting, then this might not be your thing. I let my butter and cream cheese sit out on the counter all evening while I prepared other recipes. Of note, I used one regular cream cheese and one neufchatel - wonderful results. By the time I was ready to make frosting, everything was super soft and easy to mix. Took about 5 minutes in my stand mixer. I did increase my powdered sugar to about 2-1/2 or 3 cups, just until I got the consistency I wanted. The taste is out of this world. I believe anyone who enjoys cream cheese frosting will like this recipe - if you want a little different flavor, all you need to do is tweak it a bit - but the basic foundation is here. Great recipe!

This was really good but it makes soo much! Enough for two cakes.  I ended up throwing away some of it because it was so much more than I needed. So, that was a waste of money. Next time I will half the recipes.

Great recipe.  I reduced the fat by using 1-8 oz lite cream cheese; 1/4 c light margarine and 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla.  What a great option when you need a cream cheese frosting with less fat.

I halved this recipe which made more than enough for a 13x9 cake. I used 8oz Neufchatel cheese, 1 1/2 cups confec. sugar, 1/4c butter, 1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract. I think next time I will add a little almond extract as suggested by another reviewer to give it more flavor. Went great on the Pumpkin Cake III

This is a 5 star recipe as long as you add 3 cups confectioners sugar instead of two. Perfect sweetness and cream cheese combo. I made this frosting for a baby shower cake and tinted it ivory. It spread nicely and held up well after being refrigerated overnight and then set out at room temperature for a few hours. People complimented the frosting over and over. I also layered the cake with this frosting in between layers and it was so tasty!

This is one of the best cream cheese frostings I have tasted. The characteristics I like the most are the fluffiness and the fact that it is not sickeningly sweet. I did add an additional teaspoon of vanilla, but other than that I prepared the recipe as written. This is perfect for the person who does not like super sweet frosting and loves cream cheese. The frosting is subtle enough to let the cake be the star but delicious enough to stand alone. Why mess with perfection? I will use this whenever I need a cream cheese frosting!

Good frosting. Some of the reviews say to add sugar, but I say "dont". If you add sugar, its gonna be one of THOSE cakes where you scrape off the frosting and eat the cake. I thought this was wonderful and I wish that I added more frosting to my cupcakes. Ty for the recipe.

If you are planning on using store-bought icing... DON'T! I don't care what kind of icing it claims to be, this recipe will be 10x better. Just try not to use reduced fat/fat-free cream cheese if you don't have to!

As I was only frosting a bundt cake ("One Bowl Chocolate Cake III"; which is really Hershey's Deep Dark Chocolate Cake recipe that I've been making for years), I halved this cream cheese frosting recipe. I didn't add vanilla, per the suggestion of one reviewer, besides, I didn't have clear vanilla and really wanted the frosting to come out strikingly white. This recipe does not seem to taste "overly cream cheesey." And it is not overly sweet. I find that this is a happy balance between rich and subtle. If you like strong cream cheese flavor, add more, if you like sweet, add more powdered sugar. This recipe does make a lot and I'm glad I halved the recipe. I also added some milk to thin the frosting down a little, as I wanted the frosting to be a little thin to slide down the edges of the bundt cake a bit. This frosting recipe as written will yield a thick enough product to beautifully frost just as in the picture submitted my Janni. Love this recipe and will definately be using it in the future. Thanks for the submission.

I made this frosting according to the recipe, it is very light,fluffy, and easy to spread.  However, I did find it lacked the tangy flavor typical of most cream cheese frostings which I prefer. Next time I'll try a dash or two of lemon juice and more confectioners' sugar.

Yum! I had to frost a lot of cupcakes so I used more powdered sugar (4 cups total) than the recipe called for. I also added another 1/4 cup butter, and used 2 tsp vanilla. This was more than enough to frost ~56 cupcakes, and was very easy to pipe with.

This was a great recipe. Honestly, the only reason it's a 4 and not a 5 is the burden of keeping it refrigerated. I have a small fridge and I made this for a carrot cake for Easter. With all the other things I cooked, I had to throw out all of the cake that didn't get eaten to make room for leftovers in the fridge.

Very easy and tasty.  It's the first time I've made Cream Cheese frosting from scratch and I loved it.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked just fine.  I didn't measure the vanilla exactly and that worked just fine.

This is not a "frosting".  It is more the consistency of a danish filling.  I made it to put on confetti sugar cookies and it just tasted wierd.  Definately will not make this again.

This was O.K. as written, but I prefer to use half the amount of cream cheese, and keep all other measurements the same.  This modification is definitely sweeter, but I think the recipe as written allows the cream cheese to be overbearing and it makes me think that it belongs on a bagel rather than my cake.

I couldn't believe something that only took 10 min. to make could tast so very very yummy. Great for spreading on cup cakes. I like the fact that it wasn't overly sweet also.

Simply Amazing!!!! I made this tonight for the frosting on my fake tiramisu cake. Actually it was a layer cake with a cream cheese filling and cream cheese frosting with coffee spiked cake layers. I was out of a few things for the cake and had to substitute cream cheese for everything. Thanks so much for the recipe. I did not change a thing. It has the perfect ration of tang and sweetness.

If you are having trouble decorating with it, double the powdered sugar and it will be stiffer

This frosting is fantastic!  I wasn't sure my husband, who likes things so sweet I'm surprised he has any teeth left, would like it but he actually said the word 'fabulous' when he tasted it.  In fact, I think he said it twice! This is definitely the only cream cheese frosting I'm using from now on.  By the way, I halved the recipe and it was plenty to frost 24 cupcakes.

An excellent cream cheese frosting recipe. I kept the cream cheese refrigerated until I was ready to use it and I took the butter out about 30 minutes prior, so it was in between refrigerated and room temp. I blended the two ingredients together until smooth and then added the vanilla and confectioners' sugar. I had an eager crowd waiting for the Chocolate cupcakes (recipe also from this site), I had made to be frosted so I wasn't able to let the frosting sit in the fridge for a while before using. I will next time and also might try sifting the confectioners' sugar and pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes. Overall...very happy with the outcome.

Finally!  I love cream cheese frosting but find the vast majority of them to be excessively sweet.  This frosting is rich and creamy, knock your sock off delicious without that sickening sweetness provided by most recipes.  Which makes this the perfect accompaniment for fresh homemade cinnamon rolls and everything else I can put it on.

So good.  I wanted something a little thicker, but the flavor of this is outstanding.  Following the recipe exactly "as is", I was able to coat a 15 x 10 jelly roll pan of banana bars perfectly, and have enough left over for a thin coat on a 9 x 13 cake pan of banana bars.  Delicious, I'll definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this kind of frosting!  I use it on red velvet cupcakes all the time (it perfectly fits 24 cupcakes).  My mother used a recipe from a cookbook before, but I like these proportions better.  Definitely recommend it!

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I wouldn't change a thing. I used 1/4 of the amount listed to frost 12 red velvet cupcakes, and it was perfect. Unlike a few other reviewers, I didn't find the frosting to be runny at all. However, my cream cheese was a bit chilled, so that might have helped. This frosting is ideal for carrot cake. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious frosting. I did make it a little less cream cheesy by adding 1/4 cup extra sugar. I put it on a banana bread cake and it was delicious. Make sure you serve it though when the cake is cold. Put it in the fridge for awhile after you make it. The frosting gets the best flavor when its cold. (Make sure you put it on the cake first though, the frosting will harden up.)

I used a modified version of this for Pumpkin Cake III. I added 2t vanilla extract, 1t pumpkin spice mix, and another 1/2c of powdered sugar.This was a fabulous compliment to the cake although it made a whole LOT of frosting. Next time, I'll reduce it by half.

A much easier way to make this delicious frosting is one 8oz package of cream cheese and one jar of marshmallow fluff and mix with mixer until creamy.  It tastes the same and is much easier.

Yowza.  I couldn't keep my grubby mitts out of this to save my life.  Luckily the recipe makes a ton of frosting so nobody was aware of my taste testing.  I would put this on just about anything that required frosting.  Would be fabulous on cinnamon rolls.

Tasted great, but melted quickly on a hot day. I used it on carrot cake cupcakes, and I had to keep putting the cupcakes back into the fridge to keep the frosting from running off the sides.

I wanted a fluffier cream cheese frosting than I thought this would give me, so I modified the amount of cream cheese and butter in the recipe. Instead of two 8-ounce bricks of cream cheese, I used one 8-ounce package of cream cheese. Instead of 1/2 cup butter, I used 1 cup butter. I kept the amount of confectioner's sugar the same, but, because I prefer a whammy of vanilla flavor, I upped that to about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Of course, it is essential that the butter and cream cheese are softened to room temperature for maximum fluffiness! I was really happy with the results, which were probably sweeter than the original and no doubt had a bit less cream cheese taste but more of a buttercream mouth feel.

Positively fantastic! I currently live overseas so my husband's family sent over a box with some American goodies; inside was a box of lemon cake mix. Well, you cannot buy the tub frosting like you can in the US so I was at a loss of ideas for what to put on top of a lemon cake... ding ding ding -- cream cheese frosting of course! I used this one, put it on my lemon cake; put in the fridge for a couple of hours to get the cake and icing nice and cold... O-M-G talk about pure heaven in your mouth!!!! Try it yourself, it's amaaaazing! Thanks for the PERFECT recipe!

This recipe was very tasty, but I had to add an additional 2 cups of confectionary sugar in order to receive the correct consistancy, which resulted in there being WAY too much frosting for a 9" x 13" carrot cake. The next time I make this frosting, I will half everything EXCEPT the confectionary sugar.  (The cream cheese taste was very strong as well.) Overall, very good, will make again with the said changes.

Very good recipe and easy to make. I liked the creamy texture and the fact that it wasn't runny but still spreadable (even when cold). It was also very tasty! But beware, it makes a big batch! I halved the recipe and frosted a whole batch of cookies ("Iced Pumpkin Cookies" from this website) and I still had half of it leftover. So I really only needed a quarter of the recipe!

I used the frosting for carrot cake III.  I thought this was amazing!  My boyfriend however, found it a little cheesey. Next time i will add more sugar.

This frosting was really good.  I put it on a Funfetti cake and put it in the refrigerator.  The frosting was really good when it was cold.  I'll use this recipe for many of my cakes.

Good frosting and very easy to make. I would add a tiny bit more sugar to this just to make it a bit sweeter. I also used 1 8oz fat free cream cheese and 1 8oz 1/3 fat cream cheese and it still was good. This recipie is too much for 1 9x13 top I would cut it in half next time, unless I was doing the sides or a middle also.

Excellent frosting.  Very easy to make.  Made recipe exactly as written.  Made in my Kitchenaid and went together in no time.  Used on Hawaiin wedding cake 1 from this site.  Frosted on a very cold cake and then let sit over night.  Perfect.  Halved recipe and it was enough to frost a 9X13 cake.  Even hubby who does not like cream cheese frosting loved this one.  This will be the only cream cheese frosting I ever use.

This is creamy bliss; not too sweet and perfect for Carrot Cake.  It even smells good.  It was so delicious that I almost wanted to make another batch just to eat after icing my cake.

Nice and strong cream cheese flavor. I really wanted the cream cheese flavor to come through and I don't like sweet frostings, so I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. I absolutely loved it. I used this to frost some pumpkin cookies and it was perfect. I've posted a photo of the finished cookie.

This simple recipe is perfect just as it is.  Just the right blend of cream cheese flavor and sweetness.  I used it with the Best Carrot Cake Ever recipe on this site and the combonation was a hit at my daughter's birthday party.  I can't figure out how people are making this too runny, are they melting the butter instead of softening it?  It was so thick I had to let it get a little warm to spread it on the cake smoothly.  It firms right back up in the fridge though.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious and easy to make--don't understand the comments about the frosting being runny--perhaps butter got too soft before using?  You should be able to fix this by sticking the butter or the frosting (if you've already made it) in the refrigerator

Very good basic cream cheese frosting recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.   This is certianly tangier than canned frosting, but that's what makes it so good.  If you think it's too tangy, just add more powdered sugar.  I really can't see how this recipe can turn out runny being that the only liquid called for in the recipe is a tiny bit of vanilla.  I think that the problem could be that some people used melted butter rather than softened butter and that certianly would make the frosting runny. By the way, half of this recipe covers a 9x13 cake generously.

This recipe was great! I used it to frost the very first cake I ever baked. It went really well with the Red Velvet Cake I recipe which I used. I made a few modifications so I didn't rate this as "the best". I added double the vanilla extract and added 3/4 cups more sugar.

Great flavor, but the consistency is a little thicker than I would like.  Is there any way to make a lighter, fluffier cream cheese frosting?  This one chills into a very heavy paste.

Not overly sweet and simple to make. A half recipe makes more than enough icing to cover a typical 13X9" carrot or spice-type cake.

If you cut the butter down it may be a perfect frosting, but it had sorta too much "buttery" flavor & not enough cream cheese flavor.  Thanks Janni.

Fantastic for banana/pumpkin bread or Carrot cake. Absolutely perfect! Don't expect a typical sickening sweet cake frosting...this is not terribly sweet. more tangy and cream cheesy. I've always wanted a recipe like this. I much prefer carrot cake over regular cake. this is icing Nirvana for these not overly sweet breads/cakes. So happy I found this recipe!

I was looking for a frosting to compliment my chocolate ganache and lingonberry infused chocolate cupcakes and decided that a cream cheese frosting may work well. Prior to making this recipe, I browsed recommendations by other reviewers and made the following modifications: I used 1-8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 1.5 tsp. vanilla. 

As with all frostings, you can modify the consistency and sweetness of the frosting by adding or subtracting powdered sugar; thus, I recommend adding powdered sugar gradually (divided, in two or more moments) to ensure that your frosting does not become too thick or sweet.

My husband LOVED this! I made this to put on,"Sam's Carrot Cake" recipe. Just by seeing the ingredients, I could tell that it would actually have a cream cheese taste. Very easy to make. One tip: if you think the frosting will tear your cake (it's think) just add drops of heavy cream until it's at your desired consistency.

This was excellent, authentic tasting cream cheese frosting. I cut the serving size to 8 to frost two 8x5 loaves of Sam's Carrot Cake (I also made that recipe at 8 servings). This was enough for one thin frosting layer in between the loaves and to thoroughly frost the top and sides of the loaves. The only change I made was using reduced fat creamcheese, and it was still perfectly sweet and full of creamcheese flavor. This is a must topping for carrot cake!

Strong cream cheese flavor may not be everybody's cup of tea, but this is exactly how I like my cream cheese icing.  I made a half batch with neufchatel (since that's what we had on hand) and sucralose (because sugar and I don't get along so well); the flavor is bang on.  

Just one note: a full sized batch of this recipe is probably about right for icing a two-layer cake.  A half batch should be plenty if you're icing 12 standard-sized cupcakes.  I still have some left over.

I made this recipe for red velvet cupcakes for charity bake sale at work -- sold out everything before the bake sale even started.  This recipe is so easy and so good.  Two thumbs up.  I also recommend you take a moment to google how to do the fun swirl with the icing ... makes the cupcakes look like they were baked by a pro.

Perhaps the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had.  I almost bought already made frosting for my homemade carrot cake and I am so glad I gave this recipe a try instead!  I didn't make any alterations other than I only had salted butter so I used that (turned out fine).

This is absolutely, hands down the BEST cream cheese frosting! We tried many when we were looking for a frosting for our wedding cake. This was it, no contest!

I used this recipe for mini carrot cake cupcakes for a Chinese Auction.   The cream held up well and it was tasty.  People were asking for this recipe.

I don't know what the people who modify this recipe are talking about, this is the best recipe for cream cheese icing EVER. I tried the various things people talked about, like increasing sugar and vanilla, but it really took away from it. The original gives by far the best taste and consistency. Great on carrot cake!

I tried this recipe for my red velvet cake, and it worked out amazing! It is very sweet, though, but it has that wonderful homemade vibe to it! The only thing is that you can taste the cream cheese a bit more than anything else. Also, be sure to use an electric mixer! Good luck!

This recipe is pure heaven just the way it is!!! When I think of a cream cheese frosting this is what comes to mind. I love that it has a more cream cheese taste but yet a little sweet.  Great job on this recipe, it's perfect!!!!

This is so delicious, it's like its own little dessert.  I would have been happy spreading this on top of a graham cracker, lol.  I noticed a couple people having trouble with the consistency but if you notice in the instructions it suggests putting in the refrigerator after using.  Try placing it into the refrigerator 15 minutes before using as well and it firms up just fine.  I spread mine into a 9x13 of brownies, so I didn't really care what consistency it was.  Tasty regardless.  Thanks.

This was good however I only used 1 package of cream cheese for 2 round cake pans, and I used more powdered sugar plus a few tablespoons of pineapple juice. I took about a cup of frosting out and blended some minced drained pineapple which I used for the middle of the cake, and used the rest for the top and sides. I baked a Pillsbury pineapple flavored cake for the icing since I didn't have time to make one from scratch. Yummy!

Very good. It came out smooth and very rich. Just what I expected from a good cream cheese frosting. I am a novice baker and read other reviews about it coming out runny, mine did not. I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect!

I've made this frosting a number of times and can't believe I haven't reviewed it! I love cream cheese so this was right up my alley! I made it just the way it says and it's perfect! I used it on Dark Chocolate Cake II on this site! Yum! I also freeze any left over and use a month or two later and it's still perfect! Thanks so much for this, Janni!

I made a layered pineapple upside cake and used this as the frosting in the layer. I did make a couple of changes: instead of the vanilla I added 2 tablespoons of Malibu Coconut Rum and a cup of unsweetened flaked coconut. It was outstanding. And took an ordinary pineapple upside down cake to a whole new level.

This was  great recipe! I love cream cheese frosting; the only problem for me is that some cream cheese frostings can tend to be a little grainy. This recipe was wonderfully smooth; and I didn't even use an electric mixer! The only thing that I would recommend if you like lighter, fluffier and smoother cream cheese frosting is that I used the pre-whipped cream cheese. A truly wonderful recipe! 

(I ended up using it this time for banana bread and the two went together really well.)

I love the flavor of this frosting. It has just the right amount of sweet and cheesy taste.  I don't like super sweet so this is just right. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and the consistency was perfect, light and fluffy. I usually tweak recipes, but this one doesn't need it. I have to confess that I was licking the beaters as I did when I was a kid.

We found this frosting to be heavenly! Great flavor and consistency. Yes, it was very loose and creamy at first (not what I would call runny though), but that worked out great for the initial application to my cake. Had I had time to refrigerate each of the 3 layers with the frosting on top for a few minutes before assembling, I don't think it would need stabilizing with a bamboo skewer through the middle of the 3 layers, though this worked really well.
I placed what was left in a glass bowl in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes to firm up while I placed the iced cake in the refrigerator. The firmed frosting worked great in my piping bag for the finishing touches.
I made 1 1/2 recipes as I was frosting a large three-layer cake (Sam's Famous Carrot Cake from this site.) 
Ended up having a little frosting left over, but it's in the freezer for later use. I did add about 1/2-3/4 tsp extra vanilla (to this larger portion) as some other posters had suggested. This frosting apparently accepts color well also according to all the photos posted. 
Our family and friends devoured the dessert like they had never had cake before - all the while ooo-ing and awww-ing. Will be using this recipe time and again! Thanks for posting, Janni.

I love a good cream cheese frosting but I'm sorry, I definitely tweaked it. I used 4 oz of softened cream cheese, about 6 oz of softened butter, 3 huge tbsp. of corn syrup and a good splash of vanilla extract.  Mixed until well blended and light in texture.  Added icing sugar 1/2 cup  at a time until I thought I had enough to frost my cake. If needed, add a tsp of milk or cream to frosting to blend.  If too soft, just add a little more icing sugar until you get the consistency you wish for frosting your cake.

GARBAGE.  I have no idea how this recipe can be called a frosting or an icing of any kind.  It is a glorified glaze. I used HALF the amounts of cream cheese and butter, beat the h*ll out of it until they were airy and light, and still needed almost a full POUND of icing sugar to get anywhere close to a frosting (it was still runny and loose and not at all fit to ice a cake). TERRIBLE recipe.

Too much cream cheese or not enough sugar.  I love the combination of ingredients, I tweaked it this way - 1 8oz cream cheese (I just didn't have enough cream cheese on hand), 1/2 stick of butter, and 1 cup sugar.  It was a perfect amount for a  sheet cake (only frosting the top).  Next time I would increase the sugar to 2 cups.

I changed it to a lemon one and I added one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. It was delicious!! But, it is definitely icing NOT FROSTING!! I could not pipe it on my cupcakes so I just used a knife. It is delicious though!!

This is a simple and delicious icing. Success with this recipe depends on the consistency of the the cream cheese and butter.  The butter needs to be soft not melted. The cream cheese must be the regular cream cheese not the light or whipped cream cheese. Cream cheese should not be too soft when mixed.  I leave out of refrigerator unwrapped in the bowl with the unwrapped butter for about an hour. Then I cream them together with the mixer.  I use this icing to frost soft sugar cookies and dip them in ground nuts. The icing mixture requires refrigeration if at room temperature for more than an hour or so depending on room temperature.

I don't give out a lot of 5 stars- it has to be truly fantastic for me to do this.  And this icing is FANTASTIC!  Don't let the other reviews scare you.  It is truly fantastic with two packages of cream cheese.  I do add a little bit more powdered sugar to taste, but otherwise perfect!  Refrigetate immediately once iced as it melts quickly.

This is amazing! Love love love! I don't think I will ever buy frosting again. This recipe is good as is.. with that being said, if you want chocolate I added 1/2c coca powder and it was perfect. I only added 1/4c to start with, so just play with it till you get it to the right level of chocolate. I will be using this recipe all the time now. Oh! One last bit of advice lol drape a towel over the bowl and the mixer if you are using a hand held to cut down on the coca dust... I about choked to death!

I prepared this cream cheese frosting recipe according to the recipe, and loved it.  I normally cut the amount of powdered sugar because I like this frosting a little more tart.  This recipe's ratios, however, are spot on.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I had some red velvet cake mix lying around but no frosting, this was the perfect fit for it. I took the first commenter's advice and added 2 cups sugar, 1 and 1/2  tsp vanilla, 1 8oz package of creamcheese, and 1/4 cup butter. It turned out wonderful! 5 stars for sure!!!

It is not the kind of icing I prefer, but it was good.  The flavor of the butter comes through more than I like. I put it in between and on the top of the two layers of carrot cake, but had I planned to put it on the sides of the cake, I think it would have run.

Quite possibly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  I do love cream cheese though!  I used 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese, 1/4 butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tsp of good vanilla.  It was the right amount for a 9 x 13 pan of zucchini bars. Great recipe!

This is SO easy to make, and it tastes so much better than store bought.  I didn't realize that store bought had TRANS FAT in it!!!!!!!!!!! YUCK!  I am so happy I decided to make this for my 4 year olds birthday cake.  I actually used the light cream cheese, but you'd never know it!  It was great.  Thanks for sharing.

AMAZING!!!! Just made this for the first time it has a fantastic taste seems thick enough for the carrot cake that is in the oven. Can't wait to frost the cake. The only thing I did different was not change a thing. Why would anyone do such a thing. Again AMAZING and thank you for sharing YOUR recipe

Finally a cream cheese frosting that you can taste the cream cheese! To all the people complaining about too much cream cheese taste, well...look at the title of the recipe! Maybe you would be better off buying the sickly sweet cream cheese frosting from a can.

Anyways, I made this for carrot cake cupcakes and followed the recipe exactly. I had no problems spreading it at all. It's perfect.

Best cream cheese frosting ever!  I halved the recipe (and found it to be quite enough for my frosting needs) but per other suggestions upped the confectioner's sugar by a cup.  Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!

Super easy to put together and it's the perfect amount of frosting for a layer in between and to cover a 2-layered 9-inch cake.

Excellent recipe for cream cheese frosting!  Just what I was looking for, not too sweet, with a great cream cheese flavor!  Super easy to make - I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount to frost Sam's Famous Carrot Cake that I baked in a bundt pan!  YUMMY :)

Easy to make. I cut it in half for a 9x13, and there was enough. I felt it tasted too much like cream cheese, and not really frosting. Everyone else loved it...

This is a delicious recipe!  Not too sweet, just sweet enough.  I made pumpkin muffins (using the Maine pumpkin bread recipe from this site) and frosted them with this frosting.  Wonderful!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This was VERY good frosting.  I used it on cinnamon rolls and was thrilled with the results.  It does have the "twang" of cream cheese, but if that is what you are looking for, then this is the icing to use!  I am currently making it for a red velvet cake as well.

Yummy! Following other suggestions I halved the recipe. I am very glad I did because it made a lot even halved, perfect for a 9 x 13 cake. I also increased the sugar to 2 cups (for the halved recipe) and the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp.

If you want an extra cream cheesy frosting this is it. Not in your face sweet. For a cake that needed a little extra sweetness I did add a total of 4 cups sugar instead of 2, but it just depends on what you are looking for and what cake you are frosting!

i cut the recipe in half since i did not need much frosting (was just using to try out my new decorating tips, doodleing on cupcakes). it held together well, set up nice and honestly tasted like someone had put cheesecake on top of the cupcakes (should be called cheesecake frosting). would use again, but if you do not like the taste of cheesecake then i would not suggest this recipe.

I used this recipe to frost cupcakes and it tasted pretty good, but I had some trouble with it looking separated/streaky once I added color to it.  It was also a little thin for piping to start with, but I was able to thicken it up a little with extra powdered sugar (although then it got a little sweeter than I would've liked).  I will try this one again, but next time i'll make sure i'm more careful about bringing the butter and cream cheese to room temp first.  Also, I didn't sift my powdered sugar this time, and that may be why I got streaks.  I think i'll also try mixing the cream cheese until smooth and then adding the butter a little at a time.

This icing is PERFECT for a carrot cake. It's definitely more cheesy than sweet, which compliments the cinnamon and nutty flavor of the carrot cake way better than a frosting that's all sugar. To make it even better, I add a few splashes of amaretto to really bring out the nutty flavor of the cake.

Very good recipe.  The only change I made was to up the vanilla a lot.  Also if I need to use it for piping I only use 2c sugar if I want to spread it I use 2 1/2 c. (eye balled both amounts).   Also love  the idea of the cocoa added to it.  Will try that next time!  Thanks for sharing!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS exactly as written!!!!  Perfect on my carrot cake!  Thank you!  *****Edit:  I've made this recipe many times now, and I do not understand how people can say that it is runny unless they are changing the recipe amounts or the ingredients themselves.  This is a beautiful cream cheese frosting!!  It will always be my go-to!  Great on red velvet cake, too!

I am sorry but I didn't like this. It tasted like yogurt and it ruined my red velvet cupcakes. The flavors were not complementary. This is the way to fix it, 2 cream cheese, 1/2 butter, 4 confectioners sugar (or else it will be a liquidy blob), vanilla and a little bit of lemon juice. I should have used my old recipe.

Really easy to make. I followed the other suggestions and only used one 8 oz package of cream cheese and upped the icing sugar to 3 cups. It was pretty runny when I finished mixing it so I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and it firmed up. 

The resulting icing was a little sweet for my taste, but I served it between two gingerbread cookies to my husband (who has a real sweet tooth) and he could not get enough!

Very simple and very tasty. Suggestion - for those looking for a very white frosting try using clear vanilla extract. The colored vanilla does add a tint to this frosting.

Tastes fine, but was runny as heck.  Photo suggests would be appropriate for piping.  Even after 3 hours in the fridge it wouldn't firm up and I followed the recipe exactly. Boo.

I'm so glad I chose this recipe for my daughter's first birthday cake.  It was delicious and the whole family loved it.  I made it exactly as written.  

A few notes:
-I doubled the recipe to frost and decorate a 12" round cake and even then I barely had enough.
-The consistency was just right for piping decorations.  Next time I might thin some of it just slightly for more spreadable icing.
-I think I didn't let the butter warm up enough.  I had flecks of butter that jammed in my decorator tips as I was piping.  As a total newbie cake decorator it was frustrating, but probably totally my fault.

I'll definitely use this recipe again!

I made this to go along with some red velvet cupcakes, it was delicious!! I did have to add more confectioners sugar to get it to the consistency I needed it to be. The flavor from the cream cheese is perfect! I wouldn't alter the amount of that, if you want a true cream cheese frosting.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Used all top brand ingredients.  The flavor was great but the  frosting was to runny.  I tried adding additional sugar to thicken but it did not help.  Will probably not make again.

I've made butter-cream icing and wanted to try cream cheese icing.  I took other reviewer advice and cut cream cheese and butter in half because I only needed to ice a 9 x 11" sheet cake.  I still used 2 C powdered sugar; however, I will try less powdered sugar the next time.  Hubby and I like the icing; but I think I'd be happy too with less sugar as called for by the original recipe.  Must try!

Awesome frosting!! I made it exactly as called for but added a little more vanilla and a little more sugar because I think someone said in a review that it wasn't sweet and the cream cheese was overpowering. I thought when I was done mixing it was a little thin but sitting in the fridge really helped. Husband and kids loved it!!

PERFECT if you are looking for the tangy, real cream cheese flavor! I halved the recipe because I only needed a little bit, so I used 1 8oz bar of cream cheese, 1 half stick of butter, 1 teas of vanilla, and about 1 1/4 cups of confectioners sugar.... AMAZING!

Yummy! My family (((really))) enjoyed this with carrot cake (box mix). 
This frosting was SO good- it made the box mix cake seem completely unworthy. Next time, we'll use this delicious frosting on a more deserving homemade carrot cake. With raisins. Oh, yesss!
Creamy, cheesecake-y deliciousness. You know it's great when you wake up thinking "Mmm, cake for breakfast!" :)

I dont even like cream cheese frosting and this was probably the best frosting of any type that I've ever had!!!! YUM!!! I doubled the conf. sugar and beat the mixture for approx 5 minutes. (had to scrape the mixer blades as the frosting got thick). Everyone here loved it and thought it was a marshmallow frosting. This is now my official go-to vanilla frosting!

Made according to the modifications of the top reviewer; excellent!  Instead of vanilla extract I added vanilla bean paste which made it have a very good vanilla flavor.  Used with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake.  Will make again.

I followed this recipe exactly with no variations at first. It was very thin. I had to add almost 2 more cups of sugar to get it to stiffen at all and then put it in the fridge over night before it really firmed up.

 I reviewed a similar recipe I used in the past and it called for 1 cream cheese to 2 cups sugar and was firm and able to use right away. I would not use this recipe again.

yummy-- very cream chees flavor & definatley better than the store bought -- stuff. Real butter makes it better -- too. I also added 2 tablespoons of carmel topping for carmel cream cheese frosting on some boring sugar cookies -- with a little finely chopped nuts-- (looks super fancy -- but really super easy) :)

Good taste with a dense feel. Easy recipe. Definitely holds it's shape. And definitely feels and tastes sinful. Would use this recipe again if looking for a dense cream cheese frosting.

This frosting is amazing!  Everyone loved it!  It is like cheesecake...yum!  I made a couple changes.  I was using this frosing for the Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes on this site (Amazing!) I used about 12 oz. of cream cheese and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Not only did it taste wonderful it looked beautiful!

Sooo Yummy!  I love cream cheese frosting.  I did increase the sugar a bit to tone down the tang of the cheese for my pumpkin ginger bread, and would recommend you add sugar to your preference  starting with recipe amount for base.

It tasted amazing but it did not look like frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly and my frosting had the consistency of a foamy cake filling, it appeared that the butter or cream cheese separated.  I ended up using the whole box of powder sugar in the recipe and then it looked and tasted amazing.  I gave it 3 stars because as written, it did not work for me.

EDIT:  I made this again and it came out delicious.  I followed someone elses recommendation to beat the cream cheese and vanilla firat and then add the butter, perfect consistancy.  I don't know what I did wrong the first time.

If you need more, you can stretch the batch by adding more powdered sugar. Best characteristic is that even when I've doubled the sugar, the cream cheese flavor stays strong.

I love this one. I add the powdered sugar a little at a time and periodically taste test for flavor and check consistency to make sure its how I want it.

The perfect frosting! (& I normally HATE frosting!) This is very full of cream cheese flavor, and not too sweet tho still plenty sweet. The only adjustments I make is more vanilla & sometimes we add the smallest bit of cool whip to make it fluffier. but I dont change it much. My family loves it on any kind of baked good but we use it most on our unique cranberry salad for thanksgivings and on our pumpkin bars for halloween. We are huge pumpkin bar fans & have made them every year just about & we always use this frosting for them! BEST on the site. Cant be beat! (NEVER buy the store bought kind when you can make this... the store stuff is just GROSS once you have tried this!)

SOOOOO SOOOOO amazing! Made this and frosted it on top of pumpkin cake from this site and brought it to my aunt's last night for everyone to enjoy while we passed out candy.Those who said they'd only taste it had to grab their own peice. Absolutley amazing and NO changes are needed.

Yum!! Used this to top the Pumpkin Cake III and it was perfect! I used rum extract instead of Vanilla for a slight butterscotch taste that complimented the cake nicely. This is not too sweet, but absolutely sweet enough. I am not a fan of traditional frosting and this one I found delicious.

I only needed half so I halved the ingredients to suit my needs.  This frosting is perfection.  It's not like creamed sugar, you can actually taste the cream cheese.  I doubt I'll buy the can again unless I'm crunched for time (although, this took all of 10 minutes and I used cream cheese and butter straight from the fridge!)  I will also say that the reason I only needed half was because I didn't realize that I would need more than one can of the store bought.  So for consistancy's sake, I made my own, then dumped in the can...A completely new taste and experience.

This is the best Cream cheese frosting recipe ever! I was trying to find one like how my mother makes it, but when i saw this i had to try it. I'm such a butter fanatic and was making a strawberry cake for a friend for his birthday. EVERYONE LOVED IT! I took thawed frozen strawberries and purred them and just added to as needed. People were eating the frosting by itself it was so delicious.

This frosting is delicious and very easy to make. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used 1 block of cream cheese, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1/4 c. butter along with 1 tsp. of vanilla. It's creamy and has a true cream cheese taste. My husband likes it to dip apples in when I have left over after frosting a cake.

Easy and perfect! Don't use low fat cream cheese or Splenda or margarine! Suck it up and use the real products! This is not something "dieters" should be eating, I'm just saying.

Amazing! Followed the recipe exactly, then added just a little more confec. sugar to make it a little sweeter. I chilled it in the fridge before using, and the consistency held up perfect for decorating. Tasted great out of the bowl, and was perfect on red velvet cupcakes!

Love this recipe. I hate sweet frosting and I love cream cheese, that makes this recipe perfect. It is actually very good with carrot cake as it goes well with the sweetness of the cake.

I halved the recipe, but used 1 1/4 cups of confectioners sugar.  This created a real nice frosting - not too sweet.  Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as listed, both the regular and chocolate versions (used 1/2 cup of cocoa). Both batches came out perfectly! With regard to the comments about it not being sweet enough - Whaaaa? It's perfectly, deliciously sweet!

Wow. This is cream cheese frosting the way it should be! This is for the cream cheese lover, and not someone who wants a really sweet frosting. I made it exactly as the recipe says and I wouldn't change a thing. This will definitely be my go to cream cheese frosting recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This frosting was deemed, by my family, better than the store bought icing which used to be the favorite. Some homemade icings just do not come out tasting right they are almost bitter. NOT this recipe...it is perfect!

Yum! We put HALF the sugar and it tasted delicious. I'm not sure how everyone else can stand it with the full amount of sugar - any more than half and it would have been awfully sweet!

Great recipe - I halved the cream cheese and butter to ice a child's 9x13 birthday cake, but I'm certain it would have been great full-strength as well.

I only used 1 8oz package and cut the butter down to 3/8 cup. It was amazing! Not too sweet. I'd try increasing the cream cheese (closer to the original recipe) next time, but I was so pleased with the result of the proportions I used.

Used this on top my orange cake. First time ever baking and am glad to have this recipe as part of the cake for my mother's bday. It was tough to stay away from the fridge once this was done as it was so yummy tt I simply had to keep going at it with a spoon. Thank goodness I made much more than needed! Lol...

Thanks for this wonderful recipe! :-)

This was a very simple frosting to put together.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty for a 13 x 9 cake.  I also added some mashed banana that I read as a suggestion for my banana cake.  It turned out to be the perfect icing for the banana cake!

Altered it slightly (a little more butter and a little less sugar) to put on top of zucchini-blueberry muffins.  Scrumptious.

This is probably some of the best frosting I've ever tasted! It does work best to spread when somewhat soft, and then put into the refrigerator to firm up.

Bliss. Hands down, the BEST frosting, I've ever tasted. Easy to make, and just.... wow. Divine stuff. I made it for the Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake recipe found here on Allrecipes. I can't rave about it enough. It is just the best.

I made this a second time and I find the best way to make this is 1st leave the cream cheese and butter out until they are room temperature, 2nd beat the butter 1st by itself until it is nice and smooth and creamy than add the cream cheese gradually. I found the mixture at the end to be a lot smoother, and fluffier, my family LOVED it. Perfect for red velvet cupcakes

This is a completely foolproof recipe (although I did reduce the sugar by 30%) and it freezes beautifully for later use.

I LOVE this frosting! It works amazingly well with carrot cake. Like others have said, this is not a sweet frosting, it's more of a cheesecake-tasting frosting. I've had problems with it being a little too soft for piping, but I tried making it with COLD cream cheese and it stayed really nice and thick, great for piping. Thanks for the great recipe!

A little too cream cheezy and not enough conf. sugar. It just seemed more like a topping than a frosting. But with a little more sugar I'm pretty sure it will turn out nice.

This is my first rating and I just had to chime in.  This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had.  I've had frosting from professional bakers and this rivals any of them.  AND, it's super easy to make.  As other reviewers have stated, it makes ALOT.  I (thick) frosted an entire sheet cake (9x13) and still had enough left to frost an entire other one.  Either halve the recipe or store it for future use.  Delicious and now my go-to cream cheese frosting recipe!

Good taste but way too soft had to keep adding confectioners sugar for a stiff enough consistancy to put between a layer cake.

Really good flavor! I wanted to use it piped on cupcakes and the consistency was a little soft for that, but I just refrigerated until ready to serve and they were great!

So delicious!  I made it exactly according the directions and it turned out just as I was hoping it would.  This will now be my "go to" recipe for cream cheese frosting (my favorite).

I made this frosting to go with the Carrot Cake II recipe on this site.  The taste of the frosting was excellent.  Very cream cheese-y.  However, it was very thin and didn't hold up too well on my layer cake.  I had to chill it in the fridge before icing and then chill it afterward as well.  This icing would be better on a bar type cake or cookies, it's not great for layer cakes.  Great flavor though!

I thought this recipe was perfect. I always read the reviews before I start, and after a lot saying it wasn't sweet enough I expected to make it as directed and then add more sugar. After the initial tasting I was surprised to find I didn't need to add any. I used this on 2 dozen strawberry cupcakes and I needed just under a full batch of frosting.

This was the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tried. I only had 1 pack of cream cheese so I decreased the sugar to just over half. My kids and husband would rather eat the icing then the sugar cookies it was on.

I added a little less extract and a little more sugar to get a frosting firm enough to pipe. It does have to be refrigerated, as it loses its shape rather fast outside the refrigerator, but it's so worth it. I used orange extract in this and topped fudge-filled chocolate cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a 5 star with some alterations as suggested by other reviewers. I used about 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese and increased the sugar to 3 cups. It was really delicious and made enough to frost a 13x9 carrot cake and an 8x8 pan of brownies! YUMMY!

This cream cheese frosting is absolutely perfect! I need a cream cheese icing to ice an Italian creme cake, so I decided on this one. I added one more cup of powdered sugar, and about one cup of sweetened coconut. This was the perfect amount for a 3 layer cake.

Absolutely the best cream cheese frosting ever.  When you first mix the ingredients the mixture is somewhat thin.  However, if you place in the fridge overnight it thickens up perfectly.

Absolutely delicious. I was looking for an icing that I could use to top cinnamon rolls and I came across this recipe. The flavor was fantastic to begin (I had a quick taste after mixing it together) but my family mainly likes things sweeter so I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and increased the powdered sugar just a bit to our preference. Thanks so much!

Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, otherwise followed recipe as described, but and added a little over a tablespoon of good bourbon and a little more sugar to offset the additional liquid from the bourbon- FANTASTIC!!!!

i didn't read each of the 2000 reviews, so someone else may have noticed this already.... but this is the exact recipe for the libby's pumpkin roll cream cheese filling.  that said, it doesn't have the texture that makes me think of "frosting".  it's very smooth but thin, and would be difficult to pipe.  i used it to frost black forest cupcakes and it worked well as i was just frosting them flat across the top to cover in cherries.  the taste is phenomenal...a zillion stars if i could.  but i don't consider this a frosting and wouldn't use it generally to frost cakes.  maybe to fill layer cakes...but i think it's best used as a filling.

I have been using this recipe for a long time and it is amazing!! If you like supersweet icing this is not for you - this has more of a cream cheese taste. I use it with carrot cake and people rave about it.

I used to to put on some spice cupcakes, but then I started just eating the frosting.  It tastes exactly like cheesecake and is so much easier to make!  
Absolutely love this recipe.

I could say that if you mix it by hand and put it in the fridge overnight, then throw it in a pie pan, and top it will some fruit, you could fool anyone into thinking it was regular old cheesecake.

My 11 year old made this by herself to frost a devil's food cake.  Everyone in the family loved it.  It's not too sweet; more cream cheese taste.  It's very versitile.  We used the leftover frosting on cinnamon rolls (the Jiffy Cinnnamon Rolls from this site), and they were delicious!!!  It is very easy to make, and takes only a few minutes.

Delicious!  As written, doesn't work too well for decorating, but if you add more powdered sugar it does great.

Followed another reviewers suggestion. 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups confectioners sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Covered 13x9 cake perfectly.  So good with chocolate cake.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I only used half the amount of cream cheese (8 ounces). It was absolutely perfect, so creamy and much better than store-bought. I would suggest starting with 8 ounces and adding more, based on your personal tastes.

Delicious as is and also as a base to add other flavors to. I like that this recipe was not overly sweet like many others. I have added a little melted white chocolate and peppermint extract to frost "hot cocoa" cupcakes as well as coconut extract and a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk to frost a coconut cake.

Really good. I listened to someone's suggestion to do 1/4 c butter and 2 c. powdered sugar instead and it was perfect. Everyone was raving! It was more than enough for a 9x13 cake.

I made this recipe exactly as written and used it to frost Red Velvet Cake I from this site. This frosting is very good, but VERY INTENSE. It is like eating a piece of cheesecake. I absolutely love the fact that it isn't very sweet because my family hates sweet frostings. But because it isn't light and fluffy (when cold from the fridge it is actually more dense than a cheesecake), a little goes a very long way. The recipe made way too much for 2 9-inch layer cakes - we were all practically sick from the icing off 1 normal sized piece of cake! That said, I will definitely make this recipe again (maybe a half-recipe) and use SPARINGLY on carrot cupcakes because in small doses it is delicious!

I followed the suggestions of others and used only 8 oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter and I used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Very delicious, not too sweet or overpowering with cream cheese, just right.  I am making again tonight for a red velvet cake.

This frosting was exactly what I was looking for.  It is very creamy and not too sweet.  If you like a really sweet cream cheese frosting you will probably want to use a recipe that has less cream cheese and more powdered sugar.

This is the cream cheese frosting recipe I have been looking for my whole life. I could put this on a piece of cardboard and be perfectly content. Don't change a thing, just make it as the recipe calls for, and be prepared for fireworks. Okay, that last part might be an exaggeration.

This gets 3 stars as is but it gets 10 stars if you add 3 more cups of p. sugar. As is it's too much like plain cream cheese. I will always use this recipe but add more p. sugar or only use 1 pack of cream cheese.

If your looking for a recipe like a store bought can frosting, this is it. However, I honestly can say I wasn't. The flavor was excellent, smooth and creamy. However, It was way to soft for what I was looking for. I followed the recipe to the T but it never thickened to the point where it was stiff pipedable as I thought it would be. Now if I had thought about it at the time when I made it. I would have refrigerated the batch over night the frig to get the thick frosting I needed for the recipe I was using it with. But didn't think about it until I was reviewing it after being angished for it not setting up in my cake preparation. But then I realize. I used butter. Butter is softer in frosting and doesn't hold up like shortening based frostings. This recipe is not a "sit on our countertop and leave out" type of recipe. It's totally a make and store in the frig and would make great for a cupcake filling because it has a really good flavor. And if I was looking to do so, I'd make this again for that reason. But just wasn't what I expected I'm sorry.

I LOVE this frosting. Very rich, very creamy...perfect. I didn't make any changes and it was the perfect amount to frost an 8 inch layer cake.

Very good.  I like my frosting sweet so I added about 3/4 cup more conf. sugar.  And a 1/4 ts more of vanilla per my personal preference.  I halved the recipe and it frosted 24 cupcakes perfectly.  I used this on the pumpkin ginger cupcakes from this site.  Very good!!!!

Absolutely scrumptious, super easy, and perfectly accessible recipe.  This recipe yields a lot of icing, so I only used half of the recipe, but I ended up using a teaspoon and a half of the vanilla extract because I love that vanilla taste in my icing.  The recipe was a little sweet for the cake I was making it for, so I only used 3/4 of a cup confectioners' sugar and it turned out wonderful.

OMG! This frosting is awesome. I made no changes the first time I made it for Mom's birthday. Everyone loved it. I thought it needed to be a little sweeter the next time so I added a little more powdered sugar. Either way, this frosting is great! I made it with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake. You wont' go wrong! Unfortunately, now, I'm on a diet and I dream about this cake and frosting. I promised myself that when I loose 30 pounds, I will treat myself to one slice, that's how good it is!

I gave this 5 stars even though I changed it in a significant way.  I only used one 8-oz. pkg of cream cheese instead of two, based on some of the reviews that described the end product as a little runny.  It turned out beautifully for me. I used it on the White Almond Wedding Cake (another 5-star in my book).

Wow! I, too, don't like really, really sweet frostings. I made this recipe using lower-fat cream cheese (neufchatel), and it's still unbelievably good. I think you can tweak this lots of ways and it will still be good. I can't BELIEVE how good. Yum! Thank you, Janni! (Lots of people are adding more sugar, but this was certainly sweet enough--maybe even still a little too sweet for me, but I haven't tried it on the cake yet--I've been licking off the spoon--over and over again, by the way, it's so good. :-)) There's plenty plus some left over for a 9 x 13 sheet cake, so it's okay to sample it. :-) By the way, I am an absolute amateur at baking and cooking, so I really appreciate the simplicity on top of the scrumptiousness of this recipe.

Not sure why others had consistency problems?? It was perfect and I used it for a carrot cake. Maybe make sure the butter and cream cheese have softened before using. I also beat the frosting until it was light and fluffy.

Very yummy.  It was great the way it was, but cheesier than I wanted, so I halved the cream cheese and butter (substituted butter flavored shortning), and used 2.5-3 cups of powdered sugar.  It tastes very similar to canned frosting.

This is my first time to  rate anything on here but however I thought I would because I use alot of the recipes on this site. I love the fact that you can calculate the serving sizes. I tryed this icing, I was in a bind and needed one fast so I thought I would try it it was amazing!!!  I did however use  1 8oz cream cheese   1/4 butter and 1 c conf sugar and 1 tea vanilla. I only wanted to do 3/4 of a cake with icing.  It was  so easy and I dindnt even have to dirty up my mixer to fix it. I would recommened it to anyone to try. If you want something fast, easy and really good give it a try.  Im going to keep those items on hand just in case of emer again where I have to have something fast again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the juice andmost of the zest of 1 medium orange (I saved some zest to sprinkle over the frosted cake).  I used this frosting on a pinapple coconut cake for my birthday. D-lish!!!

By the previous reviews, I thought this would be a not-too-sweet, really cream-cheesy frosting, but it's the perfect amount of flavor and sweetness.  Just sampling it straight, it tastes kind of like cheesecake.  The perfect complement to chocolate or red velvet cake!

I am incredibly dissapointed with this recipe. In now way was this what I would consider to be Frosting. It was more of an Icing - that ran down the sides of the cake. I even added additional powdered sugar to try to thicken it, and all I succeeded in doing was making sweet soup (even after refrigerating overnight). Not a recipe I would recommend, or try again.

This wasn't too bad, but I felt it tasted less sweet and more buttery, so I had to add more sugar then recommended. After I did that, it tasted decent. Doubt that I'll make this again.

Excellent! I halfed the recipe, but kept the vanilla the same and substitued butter-flavored crisco stick for the butter - next time I will stick with the REAL butter, but it was still GREAT on choclate cake. Make sure your ingredients are not so cold and use a hand-held blender for fast mixing;) This was QUICK and EASY. Thanks!

In order to be able to spread the icing on a cake without it leaking everywhere, I had to use 6 C. Icing Sugar & 1 Tbsp. Flour, instead of the 2 C. recommended.  Lovely taste...but there's a big difference between 2 C. & 6 C. of Icing Sugar...so I only gave it 3 stars.  It's a 5 star with the changes-and refrigerate before using.

It's hard to tell how good it would have been had I used regular cream cheese, but I learned... Do not use fat-free cream cheese! It will not harden at all, and it doesn't taste that good either. I think that if I had used regular cream cheese, this would have been pretty good, though. :)

I made this recipie as written maybe added a tad more powder sugar, It was a little soft but I put it in the fridge for a 1/2 hor before frosting the cake and then after frosting the cake put the cake in the fridge before serving. It came out excellent. I used it to frost "too much chocolate cake" from this site and it was great not too sweet amd complimented the cake very well.

This is the best cream cheese frosting that I've made or tasted. If you're looking for the sugary frosting with only a hint of cream cheese (like many of the store-bought frostings) this is not the same. This is sweet but not very sweet and it has a strong cream cheese taste. This is the best frosting to use for an authentic carrot cake. Thanks for submitting this recipe; it's absolutely wonderful. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. Be careful, though, you will be tempted to eat this straight out of the bowl!

Perfect, rich and creamy, very easy. I added a bit of finely grated lemon rind to perk it up a bit, it was just the right frosting for carrot cake.

If you're making carrot cake you NEED this frosting on top. People will know it's homemade because it won't taste like that betty crocker junk in a can. It's a very smooth and satisfying cream cheese delight.

I like the flavor of this recipe, however, it turned out lumpy. I mixed and mixed until my face turned blue. Maybe the cream cheese wasn't soft enough.

Oh my goodness this frosting is incredible! I made this to frost a three-layer carrot cake, so I increased the recipe by half. It is by far the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. Some frostings tend to taste too much like powdered sugar. This one tastes like cheese cake. The consistency was perfect also. My kids devoured it. I did not change a thing. You simply cannot mess with perfection.

Delicious, and couldn't be easier! I halved the recipe and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese (I was sharing the cupcakes, otherwise I would have gone with the regular!). I added green food coloring and piped shamrocks onto devil's food cake cupcakes using a ziploc bag with the corner sniped. It piped beautifully and set up well.

I used this frosting for my 1 year old's birthday carrot cake.  The best cream cheese frosting especially because it held up to decorating very well.  I was afraid it may not be firm enough to color and be used for adding designs on the cake.  Beautiful and tasted wonderful!

Just magical!  It decorates cupcakes beautifully and sets well in the fridge.  I always put a tiny bit more vanilla than called for, and I added food coloring.  My new go-to frosting.

Perfect! I loved it. I cut this recipe in half and used it to frost my carrot cake. I also sprinkled some grated lemon rind on top of the cake for decoration, but I found it also complemented the flavor of the frosting very well. This will be my "go-to" recipe for cream cheese frosting from now on. Thanks Janni!

Great recipe - I used it to frost a cake, and I used double of this recipe on everything except only 3 (8oz) cream cheese packages - and came out perfect. Just the right amount of taste between the butter & cream cheese.

PERFECTION! This is delicious. It's not too sweet and it has a great texture. I've made many cream cheese frosting recipes and have finally found THE ONE. This along with the carrot cake recipe submitted by Marc Boyer on this site are the perfect combination. Thank you Marc and Jannie.

I followed PABBYDOG's changes, which makes a smaller batch but uses more vanilla and proportionately more confectioner's sugar. Perfect! Put it on Pumpkin Cake III (Sue Case) from this site. The combination is pure heaven!

i made this for a double-layer carrot cake, and had some left over for cupcakes. i made the recipe as is: it's very cheesecakey and rich, and so so so good. i would not change the proportions at all.

Simple to make and very good.  Used most of it for 2-inch carrot cakes (stacked) and the leftovers for graham cracker frosting sandwiches. Yummy!

my boyfriend hates sugary icing so i'm hoping this one will change his mind, i used it with the betty crocker decadent carrot cake mix, pricier than a regular box mix but so worth it since i can't make them from scratch yet. i just doubled the vanilla and added a bit more sugar to balance it out.  totally delish..

This is a cheesecake lover's dream!  Tastes just like a cheesecake mixture...pure heaven! If it's too thick for your liking or to frost your cake a bit easier, add 1 TBS. milk.  I have been using this recipe for over a year now and it never fails me...plus it's ALWAYS a huge hit!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I halved the recipe, and it made enough for me to ice two 8-inch cakes, with there still being extra left over.  I tried it with 1 cup of icing sugar, and it was really yummy but personally I prefer a sweeter icing, so I used the full 2 cups and declared it perfect! :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love the light texture and tangy taste of this frosting. It looked fantastic piped high on my cupcakes and was a great compliment to the chocolate flavour. A warning to those who prefer a sweeter, less intense cream cheese icing -- the cream cheese is definitely the dominant flavour. I (and the majority of the people who sampled it) thought it was fantastic, but a handful of my taste-testing guinea pigs thought the flavour was too strong.

Great recipe for ultra cream-cheesy frosting. I cut the recipe in half and found that just 1 cup of sugar worked perfectly. I did add a splash of lemon juice however, and that just makes it perfect! I don't care for frosting in general, but this was a hit. I used it on a cinnamon swirl cake, just the right amount. I had no trouble with it being to thick or to thin, just right!

This recipe is delicious.  I made it just as stated but I do wish I had taken the advice of others and added a cup more sugar.  The flavor was perfect but the consistency was soft, even after refrigerating.  To make it a little thicker, next time I will definitely add more sugar.

This frosting is amazing! I love how cream cheesy it is! But my boyfriend thought the taste would be too overpowering on the cake I made. So I just added a little extra powdered sugar. It still tasted great!

The best frosting I have ever had. Seriously good spread between two graham crackers. It is so good that after I frosted the cupcakes I made I had to scrape the leftover frosting into the garbage because I could not stop eating it! SO DELICIOUS!

I was looking for a frosting that would hold up in 80 degree temps, and this did so beautifully!  Everyone loved the very real cream cheese taste.  Big Hit!  I made it then put it in the fridge covered overnight so that it would pipe easier.  It was still a little thin for my liking, but I was out of time and piped it anyway.  It held up very well and was delecious!

i really love this recipe. i don't even buy the kind in the can anymore because all my friends an piers love my home-made frosting. the only thing i'd say to change the recipe is use about  twice as much cream cheese or else its just your basic vanilla frosting in comparison to a well made cream cheese frosting.

Delicious. I only needed half that amount and halving it worked out just fine. I also needed a chocolate icing so I added about 3 tablespoons of cocoa and it was delicious.

My son wanted a "cream cheese" tasting frosting.  Many on this website do not turn out with a cream cheese flavor and are too sweet.  This recipe, however is awesome and was just what he was looking for.  I've made it twice now & used it to frost his strawberry birthday cake and also a chocolate cake.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my favorite cream cheese frosting--the one I use every time whether I need it for a red velvet wedding cake or a carrot cake for Easter. It is thick enough to withstand layering without oozing out the sides and pipes well, unlike many other versions which don't have enough sugar and are too thin. This is perfect as written. If you want to keep it more on the whiter side, rather than ivory, use clear vanilla.

I also modified recipe to 1 8oz pkg Cream Cheese, 1/4 Cup Margarine, 2 Cups Powdered Sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. Vanilla. This was wonderful!! Like others have stated in their reviews..you can really get the full flavor taste of the Cream Cheese by not adding so much powdered sugar like other recipes call for.  This one is a keeper!

The best cream cheese frosting ever! Excellent on devil's food cake or on Pumpkin bread, I get compliments every time I used this one. For husband's birthday, I baked a cherry chip cake in a bundt pan, frosted with this recipe, and poured cherry pie filling over the whole thing - TO DIE FOR!!!

Very Cream Cheesey frosting...but it absolutely was the perfect topping for the red velvet cupcakes (also from this site) I made.  I had compliments from all!  A definite keeper!

A friend of mine used to have a saying: "It's so good it makes you wanna rub your nose in it and roll around awhile!"  Yup... it's THAT good! Cake, cinnamon rolls or just off of a spoon, this is some yummy stuff.  Yes, it IS soft, no matter, it's delicious!

**********! Amazing! This is so quick and easy to prepare there is no excuse to use ready made cream cheese frosting! I only used 8oz of cream cheese and one stick of butter but kept the other ingredients the same.  I used this to frost the Frosted Banana Bars on this site! Yummy!!!

I made this frosting for chocolate cupcakes for a party. I used half the sugar with everything else the same and it was definitely sweet enough and you could still taste the cream cheese. It was a HUGE hit.

Excellent recipe. Halved it for the pear cake also from this site & it covered the cake beautifully. Not sickly sweet either. Just perfect. Thanks for sharing. Will only use this cream cheese frosting from now on as all other cheese frosting pale in comparison!

Yum! Easily the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted. Following others' advice I halved the cream cheese, added an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar and doubled the vanilla.  Makes enough to thickly cover a 2-layer cake.

A very good, simple recipe that goes great with carrot cake!  Slowly adding the sifted confectioner's sugar and whipping with a hand-held electric beater resulted in a light frosting with good cream cheese flavor. I did add a little more vanilla than the recipe called for. A keeper!

yummy! i halved the recipe because I was making a 9x13 cake. I am glad I did because it was the perfect amount, and I would have eaten the rest with a spoon. I did use 2 c sugar because I like it a little sweeter. beautiful rich and creamy! i will never buy store bought or try another recipe again! thanks!!

This turned out great & as others have said, it makes enough for 2 cakes.  I felt like I had the mixer on forever to get it to the right consistency, so if you are impatient like me, tell yourself to keep mixing & it'll be worth it.

Not that this needs another great review.  I used 2 packages 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese (neufchatel), smart balance buttery spread, added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar, and of course the vanilla.  Makes a lot so had extra.  I was eating it without the carrot cake that it was supposed to go on.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!  It was definitely a true cream cheese icing.  Very creamy and really good cream cheese flavor.  I used it with my Grandmother's red velvet cake recipe.  This has a really strong cream cheese flavor - I loved it, but, my husband thought it tasted too "cheesy" and less like an icing. I guess it just depends on your preference.

This was great tasting frosting, but I think should be renamed. It tasted more like buttercream, etc.  More like a birthday cake frosting with a hint of cream cheese.  I made it for a carrot cake and didnt use it-- had to find one with more cream cheese taste. It was good, just not for carrot, pumpkin, etc., in my opinion.

Phenomenal texture.  Actually followed the recipe exactly. Room temperature cream cheese and butter is crucial.  Added the sugar by 1/2 cups.  It wasn't too sweet and it was enough to cover 3 layer 9" cake.

I used this with a pumpkin cookie recipe I found on this site and it was delicious.  The consistency is wonderful--very creamy and smooth, but with some body.  It is a bit tangy-er than most frosting, but it was a perfect compliment to the pumpkin cookies.  I'd love to try it on chocolate cupcakes someday.  One downside:  it doesn't really set up (or it takes more than a day to do so, at any rate), so depending on where and how you are transporting the frosted piece, that could be a problem.

This is the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. I could live off of it. I added a little more powdered sugar because I needed it to hold together a carrot cake wreck that I made, and it did the job perfectly. Next time I will make exactly as written and I can hardly wait. I imagine that it would be wonderful on pumpkin bread or bars.

Not what my son had in mind for his pumpkin cupcakes... as he said " there is way too much cream cheese flavor for kids", I had to double the other ingredients before it was more "acceptable" to him. Yes it was drippy after a while, I assume that is from the already softened butter being whipped fluffy and melting a bit more. Post-refrigeration it is much better. 

A double batch is more than enough for 60 cupcakes... I guess it is fine that there is so much left over, I like spreading it on pumpkin bread slices like jam...

EDIT: I find it tastes much better the next day... I have all that left over and it tastes much better than  yesterday!

WONDERFUL.  The only thing I changed was to add some more powdered sugar, as my husband said it should be a little more sweet.  I used it to go along with the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread and everyone at work devoured it!

what an intense frosting!  great cheese taste.. however, it is difficult to work with when cake decorating...soft, even when put in the freezer for a while.. couldnt make flowers..  HOWEVER, i did improvise with edible flowers and crushed pecans on the sides of my dad's 66th birthday cake (molasses cake made by his grandmother during his childhood), and how nice it looked and tasted..  a keeper recipe..

This frosting is soft, cream cheesy and mildly sweet rather than the extremely sweet frostings that are common.  I love desserts but prefer them not so sweet.  In my opinion, this cream cheese frosting is "the one".

yummy!  Authentic cream cheese flavor!  Would make over and over again!  One thing though, do keep it chilled as the warmer it gets, the more it breaks down and loses it creamy deliciousness!

This is the best cream cheese frosting recipe ever!  Don't change a thing!  After using this frosting on whatever treat I am making, I always make sure I scrape a spatula around the sides, and that is just for me (which I eat right there in the kitchen)!  I have used this with Self-Filled Cupcakes I and Sam's Famous Carrot Cake.

This frosting is amazing!!! I did add an extra cup of sugar and it was perfect. A little tricky at first because it's very fresh like cheese cake so I wasn't sure how it would do as a frosting so I gave it a chance. I used it on carrot cake. I do think this frosting is best served in a chilled cake and it was HEAVEN in my mouth. My husband told me it was the best carrot cake he had ever tasted in his LIFE. That's the kind of compliment a cook loves to hear. Give this one a chance. You will not be sorry once it's combined with your cake!!!

good recipe, it was just a little bland and boring for my taste.  definitely a cream cheese flavor, which is yummy though.  thanks.
I made this again to go on top of Pumpkin Cake III (from Sue Case). I used 1 - 8 oz. package cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 
1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar, and 1 tsp. cinnamon. It was very tasty.

This frosting went over well with my family. I served it on a apple cake. It is very rich and creamy....as opposed to a light and fluffy sort of frosting.....
I tried it after adding 2 cups of sugar and decided to add a third cup. That is simply preference though.

I made this frosting to decorate my bunny carrot cake.  I made a bunny cake (I learned how to assemble a bunny cake in this site) using one 9" round cake and I had lots of frosting left.  But it was perfect to add cream on each slice ;) I coated my bunny with coconut flakes on the frosting and it was very cute and tasty!

My husband really like this because it wans't too sweet.  I wasn't really "Wowed" by it but it was good.  It was very runny though and wasn't easy to use.  Tasted good but I would probably add more sugar to help me to thicken or something.  It was okay but not great.

Amazing frosting! Great cream cheese taste! I halved the recipe. It made enough for me to GENEROUSLY pipe frosting onto 9 dark chocolate cupcakes, which was perfect for what I needed. Great flavor & consistency! I'll use this again for sure! Would taste GREAT with carrot cake!

A terrific recipe which I have had many compliments on. I usually make it with a light cream cheese and about 1/2-3/4 of the sugar that the recipe calls for. If you are looking to simply cover a 9x13 cake, a half portion of the recipe is sufficient. 
I have made this several times with great results

Thank you for this recipe!  It was DELICIOUS!  It made a TON of frosting though.  I frosted two large loaves of pumpkin bread with it and had enough left over to do at least another one or two.  Next time I would halve the recipe.  I did add about a cup (!!) more confectioner's sugar because my hubby said he wanted it sweeter.  It was good BOTH ways.  Yum!

I made this for our annual christmas eve party and used it on a yellow cake with strawberrys between the layers and on top.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I did put it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to stiffen it up a bit.  Everyone loved it!  They were fighting over the last piece.  It was a hit!

This is a delicious and easy frosting!! Wonderfully rich cream cheese flavor. I added a little extra sugar and some cocoa powder for chocolate frosting. I found that by rinsing my mixing bowl in hot water before starting helped "melt" the cream cheese and I had no lumps. Will be making this again!

NOM NOM NOM! This makes about four cups and is twice as much that is needed for a 9x13 cake but probably perfect for a double layer 8-inch round.

This is the BEST cream cheese icing I have ever tasted. I thought it tasted just like the cheese filling you sometimes get in danishes or in other pastries. I did only add 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar because of some of the reviews I read. Thanks so much for the post!

OMG!!!!!!!!!  This is the best creamcheese frosting I have ever tasted.  It is perfect.  The only thing I changed was...for frosting the cake I only put in three cups of sugar and then for decoration I put in the other cup to make it a bit firmer.  Also I used clear vanilla to keep the white color.  The best.  Thanks for posting this!!

This frosting recipe turned wonderfully creamy and smooth. I read other reviews and made sure the butter and cream cheese were softenend well. The recipe generously frosted 2 8x8 in carrot cakes. It is how others have stated, wonderful cream cheese flavor and not overly sweet. This is not a stiff frosting. Chilling after frosting or keeping in a cool place does help. Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

I made this to top 2 dozen banana cupcakes, and it was enough with some left over.  I also used one low-fat cream cheese and one regular.  This was the easiest to use consistancy of any frosting I've made.  I would suggest doubling the vanilla, but I liked the not-too-sweet flavor.  Creamy, fluffy, soft, not instant-headache sweet!

Not impressed at all.  Too buttery.  Next time (if there is a next time) I'll cut the butter in half since it's all I could taste.  I've had better.

The flavor was good, but the consistency was a problem for me.  In my case, it turned out way too runny for cupcakes, even after I added an extra cup of confectioner's sugar and tried chilling it in the fridge for over an hour.

Delicious frosting.  Frosted Sams Carrot Cake with it using light cream cheese.  Rave reviews from co-workers.  Thank you!

This tasted great, however I had trouble with the cream cheese being lumpy and not mixing in properly. As a beginner cook it was probably me not the recipe, however I would love to know how to overcome this

Perfect frosting!! not too sweet.
Ice your cake with this, but use buttercream to decorate.  Icing is really soft even after you refrigerate.

I made this with 1/3 light cream cheese and followed the directions exactly.  My cream cheese and butter were soft- room temp. After I added the sugar, I beat the mixture for about 4 mins. to get lots of fluff in it.  This was delicious- great cream cheese flavor- not too sweet.  Frosted "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" (from this site) and they paired beautifully together.

This frosting worked out great.  Not too sweet either.  I only added 1/4 cup of butter.  This recipe made A LOT of frosting.  I considered halving it but I was making a layered cake an I wanted to make sure I had enough.  I could have generously frosted two layer cakes with it.

Soooo good! I love how the tanginess of the cream cheese is not overpowered by sugar in this recipe. I DID add an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and it was PERFECT. That's right - PERFECT! It tastes like cheesecake filling. I made this to go on top of some pumpkin muffins but haven't quite got around to icing them yet...I better hurry or there'll be none left for the muffins!

The most amazing cream cheese frosting I've ever had.  A hundred times better than anything store bought and extremely easy to make!!  So good, I couldn't help occassionally dipping a finger into the bowl!  It's a good this this recipe makes A LOT of frosting, or I might not have had any left for my cake!  ;)

I've been waiting for the "perfect" cream cheese frosting to go with the "awesome carrot cake"... as the frosting listed there is good, but not quite what I wanted. This frosting is really cream cheesy... what's the point of cream cheese frosting if you can't taste the cream cheese? If you feel this way, this recipe is for you.

Great base! I made it for pumpkin cake so I tailored it for the cake. I added an extra 1/2-3/4 cup powdered sugar, 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 -3/4 tsp cloves. The guests raved. I still have some left, it will frost 2 cakes, so next time I'll half it. Hardly any work and turned out just the right thickness and creaminess, and I live in FL and that's hard to do with our humidity! Thanks!

I'd never made my own frosting before, and I will never use out of a canister again! It was difficult getting the cream cheese sufficiently soft, but besides that, it was surprisingly easy and SO delicious. This batch makes a LOT.  Enough to frost 48 cupcakes!

Nice and thick and creamy.  Not too sweet.  I had a vanilla bean and I scooped out the bean specks to add a little extra vanilla flavor.  
I used it on a pumpkin cake and it was great!

Amazing. 
I've been looking for something like this forever. I think it's perfect with only 2 cups of sugar. It was the exact flavor I was hoping for. I spread it on top of a pan of Pumpkin Bread Pudding. I'll spread it on every dessert I bake from now on: brownies, cakes, cookies...

I only made 1/2 to frost a 9" layer cake and it was just enough.  I didn't think it was too sweet at all, in fact I added 1/2 cup more sugar to make it more like a frosting and less like just cream cheese.

Halved this recipe; used Tofutti "Better than Cream Cheese" (vegan substitute) and Earth Balance sticks.  It turned out great and was a nice compliment to the (veganized :P) "A-Number-1 Banana Cake" recipe from this site (which is a tad on the SWEET side).  Thanks for an easy recipe!

The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is that it's way WAY too sweet and I like sweet frostings, I only ate half a slice of the white cake I frosted due to the sweetness of the frosting. It was also really soft and like another person said, it was hard to spread on the cake and I did use unsalted butter (as someone else suggested) Maybe it's because I used Neufchatel and not cream cheese. But overall it was very tasty, and cause it was so sweet I can't gorge on the stuff =)

Super easy to make, and tastes delicious!  Very smooth, creamy & cream cheesy.  I used Philly neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to save some fat, and it was still wonderful.

I made this today to accompany Pumpkin Cake III. I just used one 8 oz. brick of cream cheese and used extra fine confectioners' sugar so I didn't sift. This was wonderful! This was a bit thin to cover the entire 13 x 9 pan, but I made it work! I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top and the dessert was wonderful!

Great icing recipe!  I used this with the Carrot Cake XI recipe found on this site, to make a special cake for my family.  We all loved it.  My husband couldn't raved about how good the icing was, and proceeded to lick the bowl and spoon completely clean!  I might add a little bit more sugar next time, though, because it had a strong cream cheese taste.  I can see how other people who reviewed this recipe thought it was too runny:  I think they might have let the cream cheese and butter get too soft, and might have over-beat it when they were creaming them together.  It's a fine line between not creamy enough and too creamy, so be careful.  Mine came out a little soft, but I just put it in the fridge for a bit.  Otherwise, it was great and I'll most definately use it again!

If anyone is having problems with this frosting being too soft or runny, it's probably because they are using soft margarine [in a tub], which has water in it [this is what keeps it soft, even when it's very cold]. To make this recipe have its best texture, use stick butter or margarine.

Great!  I made for a red velvet cake, wonderful.  Made a ton!  I kept left overs in freezer, it stayed soft, easy to use left over.

I let the butter and cream cheese come  to room temp to soften and then the frosting itself was too soft.  I added extra sugar but never could get the frosting to the texture I prefer.  It was REALLY yummy, though.  Just not a very stiff frosting.

This was the first frosting I've ever made (normally I'm quite happy with canned varieties), but this was so easy; I just threw everything in the food processor.  The recipe made enough to frost a layered red velvet cake AND a batch of brownies, which tasted exactly like the kind I used to get from my favorite bagel bakery.

Super easy, took about 5 minutes. Not overly sweet and very pleasant tasting. I added some melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to about a quarter of the resipe and used the resulting chocolate frosting for garnish on the cake. Will make again.

This is an excellent, reliable recipe for a delicious cream cheese frosting.  It goes well, of course, on the spicy types of cakes, but it also sets off Red Velvet cake very well, and actually any kind of chocolate cake!  I use this recipe regularly in place of a vanilla frosting.  You will not be disappointed with this one!

Used this frosting to top the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin bread and it was delicious
 (although I could have just eaten the frosting and been very happy).

Two thumbs up!

Yum!  I made this frosting for banana bars.  I'm so confused as to why or how people are having a consistency problem with this recipe.  It's probably the easiest frosting recipe I've ever made.  Fully softened the cream cheese and butter, threw them in my kitchen aide bowl with the vanilla, let it mix using the whip attachment while I sifted the sugar.  Added the sugar, whipped it for about 3 minutes...DONE.  Spread perfectly on my banana bars that I baked in a 15x10 baking dish.  Plenty of frosting.  If you're looking for super sweet frosting where the sugar overpowers the cream cheese, this isn't it.  Delicious real cream cheese frosting that I ate with a spoon...holy moly!  I'm traveling with these banana bars so I put everything in the fridge to firm up before cutting.  They need to be pretty!  Can't wait to taste them!  UPDATE:  The banana bars were very good on their own.  This frosting is seriously the star of the show and made them DELICIOUS!!!  I thought they would be better cold.  I was wrong.  Room temperature, they were AMAZING!

I just made this for the 6th time (red velvet cake recipe today) and I am still amazed at how delicious it turns out.  From lemon cupcakes to carrot cake, it never fails to delight everyone who tastes it.  This is now a staple recipe that I don't even need to write down!

Tastes delicious as is.  If you like your icing thicker, simply replace the butter with butter flavored Crisco.

This is the best recipe. But I altered by accident. Only put one package of cream cheese in it. It turned out really good. People that liked just a little less cream cheese flavor would enjoy this. Consistency was just as thick.

Note: Not sure how anyone could make this recipe runny.

Did the recipe exactly as stated  and it was a great success.  We used it for 13× 9 carrot cake and it was a large, high cake and it covered it nicely.  Big hit and will keep this recipe for sure.  Thank you for sharing!!!

First time I fixed this, so made no changes and followed the instructions exactly. It was creamy and very smooth. My family loved it. I will make again; and perhaps the next time, I may use grated lemon zest and lemon juice for just a slight bit more "tang"

I thought this was very good!   Remember... the more powdered sugar you use, the thinner it will get!!   I love the taste of cream cheese and that shines through in this.   I've also added a couple teaspoons of Lemon Juice.... adds just a little zing!   Love it!

So delicious- in order to make it more of a frosting I followed another reviewer and was able to Ice an 8 inch layer cake and pipe on top.   In my stand mixer, I creamed the room temp butter and powdered sugar and then added the vanilla. I then cut prices of  COLD cream cheese and added while the mixer was on medium. I also added a tablespoon of meringue powder. Worked and tastes great! ????????????

This is a VERY runny product, it barely holds form.  I don't recommend it at all for a frosting. It's more like an icing.  Tried to use it on cupcakes and it was extremely disappointing.  Basically was a cupcake decorating failure.  And I followed the recipe exactly.  No user error, I've worked in a kitchen for years. If you want to use it on cinnamon rolls or quick breads, that's fine.  It's a terrible idea for cakes or cupcakes, or anything that needs the frosting to hold shape.

This was my first time making cream frosting and I incorporated the recipe revisions suggested in Pabbydog's review (8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla).  I also used Neufchatel cheese rather than cream cheese.  It's definitely a WOW recipe that you can eat with less guilt than eating so much cream cheese.  This is a great, rich-tasting frosting that can be used on just about anything.  Highly recommend!!

Used frozen butter and shredded it to facilitate time... fantastic outcome.  Will use again.  The recipe filled and covered an 8" layer cake.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. The first two times I made it the way the "most helpful" reviewer did, with less cream cheese. This last time, however, I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was my favorite!! So good and everyone who tried it was asking for the secret to getting it to taste so perfect! Thanks!

We're not big on frosting in my family. Too sweet! This recipe doesn't have that problem. The frosting tastes like cream cheese and is just sweet enough to satisfy even those with a higher sweet threshold. It's my go to recipe for carrot cake topping.

The only change I make is to cut the sugar by half. One cup is more than sweet enough.

This is a great recipe and my family loves it! Now we make it for any time we need a quick GREAT frosting! I also used regular sugar and it still worked out just fine! You can also add other things to the frosting such as chocolate and strawberries! One other great thing to use the frosting for is using it on cookies!!!??

I'm not sure how the people who found it runny, went wrong.  It's an icing, not a frosting, but still!
-Use CREAM CHEESE, not CREAM, like someone must have, by their comment.
-Wait until your cake cools down before icing it, so it doesn't start to melt.  At room temperature, it spreads like butter or cream cheese, amazingly enough.
-It may seem obvious, but if you don't like the taste of cream cheese, don't use cream cheese to make icing.
I only used 2/3 cup of icing sugar because I want to taste the cheese, not the sugar, and it still stuck fine to my cakes--mind you, they had tapered sides from the tapered sided pans I used, so more traction.

Went great with my black bottom cupcakes.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and creamed the butter and powdered sugar first, then added slightly chilled cream cheese.  This gave a nice thick texture that was easy to pipe on.  Will definitely use again!

Very good... smooth and creamy.A real cream cheese flavor. I took the other reviewers' advise and used 1 package of cream cheese and 1/4 c butter with 2 cups powdered sugar. I like VERY sweet frosting, so next time I will add a little more powdered sugar.

Turned out just fine. Did not have any thin issues. I made sure I used powdered sugar and not granulated. Found wisking helps add structure to frosting. Also reduces any lumps. I will use this recipe again.

This was awesome. I ended up using 3 cups of  sugar tho for just a touch more sweetness and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. If you end up with something runny the recipe is not the problem. Remember as you beat the icing you're warming it and butter will break down if it gets too warm. Unfortunately there isn't a way to fix it after that so if it looks like its getting too soft put it back in the fridge for a little bit or do it in a chilled metal bowl.

This is good on carrot cake. I read the review that said this is not a frosting its more like an icing. I never knew there was a difference. My mother always called frosting "icing" but I thought it was because she was from Canada. So if this is icing then, yummmm I like it.

This was easy to make. I put it on a chocolate sheet cake and it was very creamy not that sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing!

I only used half of every ingredient because the given recipe would've made more servings than I needed. With that I frosted about a dozen and half mini red velvet cupcakes with some left over. 

I brought red velvet cupcakes with this frosting to my internship and people devoured it very quickly! They said the best part of this frosting is that it's not too sweet and it's the perfect texture. The only thing I would do differently from now on is add a little more vanilla extract to mask a little more of the cream cheese taste.

Since I prefer more of the cream cheese flavor to come through I added another 1/2 of cream cheese to this making it a total of 2 1/2 pkgs.  It turned out really good!

I iced a yummy dark chocolate cake for company; the cake looked lovely.  But many of my guests (and myself) scraped the icing off, not complaining, but obviously not enjoying.  I'm so sorry to not be able to give this recipe more stars.  It just wasn't right for us.  The best way I can describe the flavor is that it almost reminds me of a New York style cheesecake.

I love this recipe!!! This is the only frosting, besides whipped cream frosting occasionally, I make for my cupcakes. Simply creamy and delicious. I usually add 1/2 cup less sugar than the recipe calls for and add  cocoa to make the chocolate frosting and it is the BEST! If anyone says this recipe is runny, they probably didn't follow the recipe correctly because I've made this many many times and it always turns out thick and creamy!

Easier to make than opening a can of the stuff they sell at grocery store. I 1\2`d the recipe and made exactly enough for a 9x13 RedVelvet cake.

This recipe was great! Although, I made it on a warm day and was too impatient to wait to put the frosting on at the party so it had to endure a hot car ride, but it was delicious! Wouldn't change anything on this recipe. This has been my "go to" frosting recipe for many occasions.

Just made this for some cookie sandwiches. I'll NEVER buy frosting again! I love the real cream cheese flavor of this recipe. Also, I love sweets (I.e. I over do sugar on almost everything :-) & I think the sweet, tangy flavor is perfect. I have only left one other review in my life, but this recipe truly deserves 5 stars.

Very good.  I made this recipe as directed.  I put it in the fridge for a while before using and it spreads easily.  I made it a second time and used powdered vanilla (to avoid liquids making it any runnier) as well as 7% more (15 grams in my case) cream cheese than instructed (my portions come in 80gram blocks, so I went ahead and put in all 240 grams) and liked it even better.  Will use this recipe again and again.  The proportions, the ratio between cheese, butter and sugar, in my opinion are right on.  Not too sweet, not too savoury and doesn't cover up the taste of the cake it dresses.  My daughter described it as having a light and delicate cheesecake on top of her cupcakes.

Made it exactly as written, and it is perfect. I would not change anything at all. Cream cheesiness heaven, not at all too sweet. I like sweets, and this is sweet but not tooth achingly so. It's very creamy and dreamy and perfect on carrot cake for Easter dinner. Thank you Janni.

This is the best cream cheese icing I've ever made. I have been trying different versions for a year. The butter is the major difference that I found.

Great flavor. I added 1/2 tsp lemon juice for a bit more of a cheesecake-ey flavor, and wow! I had a little trouble with it softening into a glaze like consistency, but put it in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes, and it thickened back up.

This recipe is the foundation for the best cream cheese frosting ever. I give it five stars because this recipe helped me make an awesome carrot cake even better. I followed the recipe closely except I added an extra tsp of vanilla extract (I couldn't taste one tsp in the mixture), and only used 1.5 cups of confectioner's sugar. It may be the extra vanilla that caused me to use less but I thought it was sweet enough by then. I even had a little leftover. Call me a pig, but it was tasty enough to eat off a spoon alone!

I made this today. It wasn't runny at all. Even though I added in 1/2 can of Solo apricot filling it wasn't runny. I did do as one poster mentioned and used my butter and cream cheese right out of the refrigerator. Maybe that is the difference between perfect frosting and runny frosting.

 It isn't cloyingly sweet either. Usually I scrape off the frosting and then eat he cake with a minimum of frosting. No need to do that with this frosting.

Other than the apricot filling I didn't make any changes to this recipe.

Overall, a very good and not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. I did add more sugar than the recipe called for, as I like it a tad sweeter than it called for. Perfect for carrot cake.

I did not have powdered sugar -- instead, I put 2 cups of sugar in the blender with 1.2 tsp. of cornstarch.  I then added the remaining ingredients -- worked fine.  Best cream cheese frosting ever!!

I have this mixed up and in my fridge right now waiting for the cake to cool...now, like the review on January of '06, I eliminated one of the 8 OZ cream cheese after reading that it was more like icing and quite runny (another review that I read). However, even then, I still chose to add yet an extra cup of sugar.  I can remember making regular butter cream frosting throughout my life and always started with 2 c confectioners sugar to 1/4 c butter, so I knew that the extra volume in the form of cream cheese may well make the product runny.  It looks and tastes yummy and I look forward to it on the cake.

I was looking up a cake and frosting for my 21st. While, at first, I thought the icing would be too thick, but after the sugar, it tastes so good! I love cream cheese and this is such a good addition to a birthday cake.

This cream cheese frosting was a really cream cheesy frosting.  The flavor was so intense that I added 1/4 a teaspoon more vanilla and it was much better.      Do not make this if you do not like a BIG flavor

I was looking for a fluffy frosting for my mom's birthday cake, and I'm very happy with the results. Also, this is the first cake that I've ever made and it's a three tier cake too.

Note: I used a bit more than 2 cups of confectioners sugar.

This was great! Very cream cheesy. Note to people who complain of it being runny, are you using low fat cream cheese? In most cases you must use full fat cream cheese in order for it to hold up.

I add a cup of sugar when I want it a little sweeter and more spreadable and leave it as is when I want more of that cream cheese kick. Great frosting.

I really loved the cream cheesy taste of this frosting. The flavor was great. If you want a sweeter version, just add a little more powdered sugar to your taste. The only problems I had with the frosting were of my own making, not the recipe's. I only had 1/3 fat cream cheese and while the flavors were still there, it never really got "sturdy" enough to pipe with any level of detail. It was pretty loose. I know that if I'd used real cream cheese, it would have been perfect. 

Because my error left mine a little thin, I did add more powdered sugar to see if it would thicken. It didn't help too much, but it did absorb a lot of sugar and still didn't seem too sweet. I'll definitely make this again but will use regular full fat cream cheese. YUM!

This was PERFECT!!!  Yes, it's tangy and not too sweet -- and that's what I want in a cream cheese frosting.  I down-sized the recipe proportions to suit my needs and the amount of cream cheese I had (4 oz).  I pulled the cream cheese right out of the fridge and accidently melted the butter but it worked fine anyway.  I've used it on squash / walnut / Craisin muffins, and oatmeal / chocolate chip / molasses / walnut breakfast cookies, and I, too, have eaten it off the spoon.  Mine was not runny, and set up even more after refrigeration; it's still spreadable.  LOVE THIS!!!

Everyone raved about this frosting when I made it for pumpkin spice muffins! It was a little thin when I first mixed it up, but after refrigeration, it was perfect. Just the right combination of cream cheesiness and sweetness!

I have used this recipe a few times now and love it!  Last night, however, I could relate to those of you who have experienced runny frosting.  I made this frosting ahead of time, and added an extra 1/4 cup butter so there would be more frosting in the end.  I refrigerated it for one day.  I let it soften a few minutes before mixing it again in the mixer.  It was runny so I tried adding extra sugar... no luck.  My advice is:  1.  Make this in a room temperature area.  If it seems warm at all, be careful of the temperature of your ingredients.  2.  Follow the recipe.  If you need more frosting, double the recipe, not just ingredients.  

This recipe is worth five stars if you make it the right way!

This is absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half for a 9 x 11-1/2" sheet cake. Used 1/4 c. Butter, 8 oz. Neufchâtel cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1 c. Sifted powdered sugar. Whipped up light and fluffy...perfect for my banana cake, with a final sprinkle of chopped walnuts. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this recipe for 6 servings and it came out WONDERFUL!! I had used some other recipes for cream cheese frosting but none of them were this versatile and this good! I couldn't help not licking the spatula.I let the cream cheese and butter come to room temperature for 8 minutes and then softened it with a spatula for a few minutes before using mixer. Also,I sifted the powdered sugar so it was LUMP FREE.

Great recipe... just know that you may need to add flour if it turns out too runny. I may have over softened my butter and cream cheese and added too much icing sugar. The more sugar I added the more runny it became. Flour solved everything and it still tasted great

Loved this recipe! I halved the cream cheese & butter (softened to room temperature), doubled the vanilla and used the recommended amount of sugar. It turned out tasty, and was just the right consistency. Will use again.

I've used this once as-is, once with 1/2 cup cocoa, and once with a teaspoon of lemon juice added to increase tartness.  Best cream-cheese frosting recipe I have ever had!  Very very good, thanks so much for the recipe.

A good, basic, cream cheese frosting! I like that there's more cream cheese than butter in this one. I used 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, and it was still very good. Thanks!

This recipe came out very runny. We doubled the powdered sugar to make it thick enough to put on a layer cake. As it is stated, it's more like sweetened cream cheese, and you could really only pour it onto a 9x13 cake or something. It made at least 50% more than is needed for a layer cake.

I just got done making this, and I scraped a vanilla bean into it on top of adding a teaspoon of homemade vanilla extract.  This pretty much beats the pants off the junk in a tub at the grocery store.  The real test of course will be how my 6 year old will like it on her birthday party cupcakes tomorrow.  It's also insanely easy to make, which is good - but very dangerous for my healthy eating habits.

Super delicious frosting! Make sure the cream cheese and butter are fully room temperature, soft and pliable. Then refrigerate the frosting for about an hour to stiffen it a bit to make it easier to spread, not quite so gooey. You'll love this frosting! So incredibly yummy!

Made a half batch as recommended by other reviews. Not a great consistency for piping unfortunately. The cream cheese frosting that comes with the Red Velvet Cupcakes on this website tastes much better, the difference being the addition of sour cream which goes great with cream cheese.

I made this today and followed the advice of some of the other members because I like a sweeter frosting, I used one package cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups sugar. Although this frosting does taste good, I had planned on using it to ice an 8inch round cake and this frosting was super thin. I would stick with cake for this, because if you plan on putting this on cupcakes it will not work.

This tasted great. I was making this to put on top of the cinnamon rolls I mad for breakfast this morning and it tasted excellent. I made a few modifications though. I didn't really need that much frosting so I cut the cream cheese in half, using only one 8 ounce package. I maintained the 1/2 cup of butter, used 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, and had to forgo the vanilla because I forgot that I ran out. To make it a little thinner, I added a few tablespoons of milk to it. Came out great, but next time I may leave it at 1 cup or 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar instead. I liked the distinct taste of the cream cheese without the overwhelming sweetness that many cream cheese frostings have.

I will admit, I am one of those people that will scrape the frosting off of the cake and throw it in the garbage. But this frosting is fantastic. It will not make you sick with sweetness or eat away at your teeth because of the sugar. It is a mild sweetness and comes out thick and creamy. I only added about a 1/4 cup more of powdered sugar then it called for and followed the rest exactly. I was able to frost 2 9 inch round cakes with plenty left over to decorate the top. Yum!

Frosting was fine, very cream cheesy. It piped onto cupcakes nicely for decorating. But was awful with chocolate cupcakes.

This is a great recipe- highly recommend it. For a 13 by 9 inch cake, I cut the recipe in half to frost the cake. I added less sugar and still tasted phenomenal. This is now my go-to cream cheese recipe!

This was the best cream cheese frosting recipe I have ever tried.  I made a yellow birthday cake with raspberry filling and frosted it with this amazing cream cheese frosting for a friend and all my guests loved it!  This frosting is so rich and decadent I hoped it made it on the cake because I kept eating it out of the bowl.

BEST ICING EVER. I made it to frost a friends birthday cake (red velvet) and it was perfect! So quick and easy to make too! I used a little more cream cheese, 250g instead of 227g, but I don't think it makes much difference. Everyone loved it!

Very good frosting. I made a few adjustments and followed Pabbydogs suggestion of 1 - 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, but I used 1 TBSP. vanilla.  It was delicious and not too sweet at all.  I had enough to cover a double layered 9" cake.  Will definitely use again. Thanks!

WOW! I did take the advice of some of the other reveiws and decided to do my own thing. Rather than adding an additonal cup of confectioners sugar, I added 1/4 extra (so 2 1/4 cups) to the recipe and also added 1 Tsp extra of vanilla (2 TSP total). I could not be more happy with the results! Still leaves you with the fabulous cream cheese taste that is not too overwhelming but is also not to sweet! In LOVE with this recipe! YUM!

this was good, I did read some reviews ahead of time and started with only 1 stick of butter so that it didn't become too runny. That's all it needed- so cutting the butter in half made for a perfect cream cheese frosting.

Wonderful! Made it with one pkg of cream cheese,2 cups of conf. sugar, 1 stick butter and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Delicious! Am glad that I read comments because if I had used two cream cheese it would have been way too much frosting. I frosted a 13X9 pumpkin cake and there was plenty. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was the best I have ever made.  I use this recipe for cupcakes.  Last time I made 28 cupcakes and I had maybe 3/4 cup of frosting left.  I used the pampered chef accent decorator to pipe this frosting onto cupcakes.  Towards the end it started getting just a tad runny but not bad.  I just put my frosted cupcakes in the refrigerator for a while.  DELICIOUS!!!  I didn't think it was too cream cheesey or not sweet enough.  Perfect for pumpkin, carrot or even banana flavored cakes or cupcakes.

This was delicious!I don't understand why people are so picky. I made this frosting multiple of times and I've gotten so much compliments! Everyone loved this frosting! Sometimes i like to frenzy it up a bit by adding a bit of jam or a little of this and that but overall it's so delicious!

The recipe is fairly easy and basic, it has a great cream cheese flavor and blended well.  However, the issue comes with the texture, creamy and delicious stand-alone does not translate well to a topping.  This must be kept cold, at room temp it is far too soft and doesn't hold shape. 
This recipe would be a perfect cupcake or pastry filling, in fact, I froze the leftovers for Christmas pastry fillings.  Even though it will make a five star filling, it's just a two star frosting. 

Pros: Great flavor, creamy texture, simple to prepare. 

Cons: consistency, texture, stability at room temp.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I could eat this stuff all by itself.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1.5 cups of p.sugar instead of 2.  Placed it in the fridge for about 20 min to firm up and then piped it on Pumpkin Ginger cupcakes.  Big hit at the office and everyone raved about the frosting as well as the cupcakes.

Absolutely delish; the best cream cheese I've ever tasted. My sister and I couldn't stop eating it straight from the bowl. I used 1 1/2 cups of icing/powdered sugar instead. Held up pretty well on cupcakes.

This Cream Cheese Frosting is very CREAMY! I suspect it's the 2 packages of cream cheese in it instead of the usual one. I like the fact that it only takes 2 cups of powdered sugar too. My husband said the cream cheese flavor really comes through. I will make this again when I need a Cream Cheese Frostin.

Absolutely amazing! I made a half batch to go on cinnamon rolls, using a little extra vanilla and sugar. Absolutely perfect. I can't wait to try flavoring it with orange extract and zest for orange rolls.

I love this frosting!  I have used it for everything from pumpkin cookies to cinnamon rolls to red velvet cake.  There are plenty of sugary cream cheese frosting recipes out there, this is not one of them!  If you are looking for a really sweet, sugary frosting, pick another recipe.  If you are looking for a nice, rich, cream cheese taste, this is it.

Oh my goodness, this frosting is amazing!  I wanted to eat it with a spoon!  I resisted, though, and the recipe was more than enough to decorate a two layer carrot cake.  I had some frosting left over, so I made brownies and frosted them with what was left (I added about 1 TBSP of cocoa to the frosting). Yum!

This is the BEST frosting I have ever made. I have used this for the clone of a cinnamon Bon and carrot cake. Taste like cheese cake. Could eat it right out of the bowl. Yummy. This really is the very best. If you want the true taste of the cream cheese, I found only Philly has the right taste. I used the store brand once and I didn't care for the taste.

This frosting is perfect for cupcakes, however, I needed this for a 2-layer cake and the icing seemed too sticky. I followed proportions for butter and cream cheese. Used 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1.5 tsp vanilla. I read that decorator's icing has shortening, so I added 6 Tbsp of cubed  shortening. I have a scant cupful of frosting leftover from the cake to keep in the refrigerator, and use on cupcakes.

I made this for some cupcakes I made for a baby shower, and the taste is soo good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the best icing to decorate  as it's too soft. I didn't want to add any more sugar because I liked it the way it was, not too sweet. I loved it anyways to ice the cake and filling.

Frosting was really good!  I did use 4.5 cups of confectioner's sugar though but only because I put it on a chocolate cake, but I think the recipe as is would be perfect for carrot cake.  The frosting was not at all runny.  It was perfectly fine for frosting the cake.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted.  Easy to make and I've had many friends and co-workers ask for the recipe when I have used it on a variety of cakes/cupcakes.  Thank you!

A delicious frosting! My family's favourite. I used it for fruit pizza on rice krispie squares and it was so yummy! Best one I've ever tried!

This is my favorite icing recipe! It tastes like real cream cheese, not the fake overly sweet junk you get if you buy it in the store! Yuuuummm!

I put 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of 16 and I added a bit more powdered sugar. It turned out great!

works better for cupcake decorating if you use the frosting right away. Otherwise I found it too stiff to work with later! (I even warmed it a little, still ended up just spreading it. Bummer.)
Taste was okay but not exceptional.

Very good; I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, except that I increased the amount of powdered sugar to 2.5 cups to make it a little sweeter and a little stiffer. Piped easily. Tasted great on red velvet cupcakes (also from this site). Make sure the cream cheese and butter are at room temperature! I'll be making this again.

Not sure if I rated this yet, but it is a definite  keeper!!!! Just a wonderful recipe that I have used more than a dozen times as icing my sour cream coffee cake.  A recipe that I have been using for years!!!  Just for personal preference I use 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 because I do love the taste of cream cheese in the frosting.  Which is, by the way, is not too "cream cheesey" for me!!  Highly recommend trying this one!

I used this frosting to top "Sam's famous carrot cake."  The only thing I did differently was I added less powdered sugar. As the carrot cake was very sweet, I didn't want the frosting to take the whole thing over the top and into the too sweet range. So instead of adding the entire 2 cups, I added 1 cup, then gradually added the second cup bit by bit, tasting as I added. I ended up only using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar total. It made the frosting the perfect complement to the cake.

Perfect! Sweet and tangy just the way cream cheese frosting should be. Made plenty to frost the inside and top of my carrotcake without skimping.
Have not tried the cake yet but the frosting is sooo good. (my daughter is 3 1/2 and thinks this is the best frosting ever.)

Wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Tastes more like cream cheese than a frosting. Perhaps would make a nice balance if the cake is too sweet.

Wonderfully tasting frosting with a great texture. It wasn't too sweet, I hate it when frosting/icing is sweet, you can't taste the cake itself. This was perfect however. I didn't use any, but I imagine that a few drops of lemon would've made it even better. I did make the mistake of not using soft enough butter, the frosting ended up having tiny crumbles of butter in it, but even so it went great with my carrot cupcakes.

Based on other reviews I decided to reduce the cream cheese to 1 1/2 packages.  I left everything else the same.  Perfect!  As another reviewer stated, you could eat it by the spoonful!

Thanks to the reviews, I made this using 1 8 oz pkg of cream cheese and added 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar so the cream cheese flavor wasn't as strong.  The flavor and consistency is very nice and creamy.

This recipie is almost identical to the one that printed in the food network magazine this month, however the only thing missing was a tsp or so of lemon juice! It's not  overly sweet it's creamy spreads wonderfully, taste great! I made this specifically for carrot cake but have enough left over to put over cinnamon buns or something!

Wonderful flavor, and so easy. I had to add 3/4 cup more confectioner's sugar to firm it up enough to use on a 3 layer carrot cake. Turned out great.

I just made this recipe to go over a carrot cake my son and I made today.  It is the perfect cream cheese frosting. We do not like our frosting too sweet; we really prefer the taste of the cream cheese to come through.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

This is hands down the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had.  I add more sugar to taste  sometimes, depending on what I am frosting.  I love the fact that you can taste the cream cheese, and not just sugar.

Since I only had one package of cream cheese and I like my cream cheese frosting to be a little sweeter, I followed everything exactly except only using one package of cream cheese. It is soooo good. I don't understand the runny issue others are having. I could frost my cake righ now if it were cooled off. I highly recommend this recipe. It is simple enough to tweek to your liking.

I'm not sure why anyone is adding more sugar to this recipe - if you're looking for a sweeter frosting, you should probably reconsider using a cream cheese frosting recipe in the first place!

The frosting came out absolutely perfect, aside from some lumps of cream cheese because I was impatient in whipping the frosting.  My advice would be to whip the cream cheese and butter on high for about 20 minutes before adding the sugar to ensure the lumps are mixed in.

The sweetness to tartness ratio was absolutely perfect with the recipe as is.  The only modification I made was to use vanilla paste (includes vanilla seeds) instead of vanilla extract for the visual effect of the vanilla seeds in the frosting.

The consistency was great for spreading on the cake before refrigerating, and once the cake was frosted I put the whole thing in the fridge to harden up.

Would definitely make this again! :)

Awesome frosting!  Went wonderfully with Sam's famous carrot cake from this website.
My colleagues went crazy for the cake with this frosting on top! Mom making it again this weekend for my brother's birthday!
Wouldn't change a thing - not too sweet at all

Yum! The flavor is phenomenal!!! I loved this frosting, however as other reviewers mentioned, the frosting is not thick enough to pipe. 

Great if you are icing a sheet cake, but if you are icing a round cake, the icing will run unless altered to thicken.

Having said that, I still LOVED this flavor. The best cream cheese frosting I have had thusfar. Gave 4 out of 5 stars due to consistency.

I made a sugar-free version of this to go with my gluten-free, sugar-free cake, and it was GREAT! I used unsalted butter (the recipe doesn't specify), increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons, and used 2.5 cups of splenda in place of the sugar. I'll be making this again! :)

i JUST made this frosting and am eating it by the spoonful right now. I'm afraid i will not have enough to frost my chocolate cake!!! This is the softest, creamiest most loveliest cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted. I absolutely love it! Perfect as is, i didn't change the recipe a bit exept use 1/2 a teaspoon of extract instead of a full teaspoon. i like a more cream cheesy flavor

This was great. My first time making home made icing and everyone loved it. I did only use 1 cup of sugar though as I like my icing a little on the tangy side. Only one person thought it should have been sweeter.  Thanks for making my Valentines Day treats a hit!

This cream cheese frosting tasted amazing! However, it was pretty much liquid even when I pretty much dropped a box of powdered sugar trying to save it and chilled it for several hours. Unfortunately, I couldn't try making it again because I was using it the next day. I followed the recipe and doubled the recipe. So perhaps it was doubling it that caused it, but I doubt it.

Thanks to PAPPYDOG, the frosting came out wonderful!  I'd followed PAPPYDOG'S suggestion of this recipe and it was plenty of frosting to cover 36 mini cupcakes, and had some left over in the bowl for my daughter...

I gave it a four because you really don't need 2 (8 ounces of cream cheese) unless you are covering a really big cake...

If you make this frosting you really need to be a big fan of cream cheese, for the flavor is really heavy cream cheese.

Perfect.  I couldn't have found a better frosting for the Carrot Cake XI (another great recipe on AR) I had made.

I have made this easy recipe many times, sometimes even doubling it for more cupcakes and it's a hit everytime! So easy, yet SO GOOD!

I halved this recipe. It was good homemeade cream cheese frosting. I probably only put in half the (homemade) powdered sugar though, since mom doesn't like very sweet desserts. I also should have waited longer for the butter to warm up since I had hunks of butter here and there! VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE BUTTER IS 100% SOFT.

This is a great recipe! I made it exactly as stated, and had no problems. The taste is great, and I love how much it taste like cheesecake instead of a blob of sugar! I'm not sure why some some people ended up with runny frosting, mine was perfect. I will make this again!

I wanted to like this recipe having read so many great reviews but it just was not a consistency I'd hoped for and was difficult to work with (on cupcakes). And the flavor just tasted like just cream cheese without enough sweetness or vanilla. I added an additional cup of confectioners sugar to make it sweeter and ended up with something that was just "ok".

This frosting is absolutely delicious. It tastes like cheesecake. Its not overly sweet and cloying like alot of other cream cheese frostings on here. I used this on a chocolate cake. I used extra vanilla because I like the taste. This is the type of frosting that if you add additional milk to it you can make a delicious glaze for a fruit platter.

Excellent tasting frosting. My ALL-Time fave. The original recipe covers two 13 x 9 inch cakes. Sometimes a little more for extra frosted pleasure. I personally use about 3 to 4 cups of the sugar because I feel with just 2 cups, it taste a tad too tangy but to each its own. Other than that, WONDERFUL & THE BEST frosting !

I love this frosting recipe! I used it for gingerbread cake with awesome results! I followed some suggestions with reducing to 1 package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of butter, 2 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. I don't think I will ever buy use store bought frosting again! Can't wait to try it with some cocoa in it!

This was a good base frosting but I did what another reviewer did was cut the cream cheese in half, add some milk to thin it out and added 1 more C of confectioners' sugar.  Probably the best frosting I've ever made hands down

Great simple recipe and I only substituted the vanilla extract with the real stuff...vanilla bean paste at the same proportion. Doing so makes this cream cheese frosting II absolutely delicious at a higher quality. Thanks!!!

This is pretty good as is.  Not sweet enough for me though.  I added another 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar and thatt did the trick!  I used this to top pumpkin cupcakes and it was the perfect match since the cupcakes aren't very sweet.  Next time, I will let it cool a bit in fridge. It was a little too thin for piping.

Made it the way it's stated and the way the top rated reviewer suggested. My husband (who dislikes frosting) licked the frosting off a cupcake. This was the reviewers alterations. It was perfect and frosted 18 cupcakes with leftovers. I'll keep using that one! Thanks!

Agreed with all other reviewers that if you have a sweet tooth, this frosting will not satisfy it.  IMHO, this serves as the perfect complement to most cakes rather than overpower them with the tooth-achingly sweet frostings I generally come across.  Thank you for this keeper!

AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! I highly recommend this recipe, so easy and in my opinion it doesn't require the suggested amount of sugar, I only used less than 1 cup and mixed brown and white, same for the cream cheese frosting I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese a lot less fat and more creamier.  You won't miss the sugar!!  ENJOY!

This is a great frosting.  The only change I made was that I doubled the vanilla.

The taste of this was wonderful. However, I followed the recipe and it came out very thin. I was not able to use it to frost cupcakes at all. I ended up cutting a hole in the middle and filling it instead.

Made this frosting to top Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes from this site. Great choice! Whipped up light and fluffy but made more than I needed for the one batch of cupcakes. Had enough frosting left over to fill a small pumpkin cake roll. Used full fat cream cheese, will consider light version next time. A keeper!

Very good cream cheese frosting, I used if for a carrot cake.  It is very easy to cut in half too. It litterally takes minutes to make.

This is a super-delicious icing but it definitely required a few minor modifications. First, in order to get the right consistency I had to use 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, not 1. Also, it was too sloppy to use without refrigerating it beforehand. Since I was using it in a piping bag (for frosting cupcakes) I ended up filling the piping bag, standing it upright in an empty juice pitcher and putting it in the fridge for about half an hour. It worked out well in the end... but there were a few stressful moments there.

the original recipe is for 24 servings... which ends up being a lot. If I made it again I would use 1 block of cream cheese with 2 cups sugar... I also added another teaspoon of vanilla for a better taste. I also used a few table spoons of milk to make it mix easier and it was still plenty thick to spread over my cake.

This recipe is great! I never made cream cheese icing before, but this was really good. I added cinnamon and finely diced apple because I was using it for apple muffins--it was superb. :)

This frosting is DIVINE. I used slightly less powdered sugar than the recipe calls for as I really don't like sweet icing. I made this frosting for the black magic cake on this website and it turned out phenomenal! It was a huge hit at a family gathering...I can't recommend this recipe enough! Thank you Janni! :)

It is perfect for carrot cake. Soft and creamy. For cup cake frosting pipped out of a bag I add a little more powder sugar, about a half of cup. Always sift powder sugar.

I'd give this 10 if I could, I JUST made this recipe yesterday, to top a 1/2 sheet cake (12 x 18 x 2)  I made 2.5 times the original amount and had SOME left over but not an extreme amount.. It topped Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (available on Allrecipes)..The cake and icing were for my husband's 50th birthday.  He LOVED it.. this from a man who doesn't like cake   The icing had the perfect amount of sweetness to go on the carrot cake.. I will never use another store bought container of cream cheese icing again!

Delicious, true cream cheese frosting.  I only made a half batch, as I only need to frost a 9x13, and after tasting it I doubled the vanilla for personal taste.

I did not read the other reviews before I made this so I didn't realize it was a tangier frosting.  My preference is more sweet on the cream cheese frosting so I ended up adding another cup of sugar.  Was pretty good with red velvet cake!

This was amazing! I added about a cup more of icing sugar to get it to stiffen a little, and about 1/3 cup cocoa powder to make it more coherent with my cake. It didn't stiffen up as much as I'd have liked but it was still delicious.  I've never been fond of buttercream or whipped frosting but the touch of cream cheese worked wonders here. I paired it with Red Velvet Cupcakes (from this site) and they were a match made in heaven. Will definitely use this as a filling between cake layers!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this icing.  I'm not a fan of icing and will usually eat the cake and leave the frosting but this icing is amazing!! Not too sweet or rich.  I add 1 T of milk to make it a little thinner.  this also goes great on cinnamon rolls but you only need half for one 9x13 pan

delicious. We upped the sugar to three cups for the kid's  cake, two is probably perfect for "grown ups".

I am a tough reviewer on frosting as much of it is too sweet for me.  However, after making this recipe exactly according to the directions and it was fabulous!  It has a wonderful taste and is easy to spread and stores well also.

I went with 1 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cup confectioner's sugar and 1.5tsp vanilla extract. It came out really soft. I don't know if it's suppose to be like that. I'm used to buttercream frosting where it's slightly firmer. But it does taste really good!

AMAZING!  So nice to have an icing that isn't sickly sweet.  Almost tastes like cheesecake filing.  Will be making this again and again.  My daughter, who HATES typical cake icing, loved this.  I added 1 TBSPN raspberry jam and 1 tsp almond extract to one batch, and to another I added 1 tsp. lime juice.  SO Good!  You can change this recipe up to flavour anyway you want.  Because it's not so sweet, the flavours really come through.

GREAT cream cheese taste however a bit sweet for me. Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time) I will go slower with the powder sugar. Start with 1-1/4 cups and work it from there.

Really good. I used 2 pkgs of reduced fat cream cheese and used reduced fat margering and about 2 1/2- 2 3/4 cups of powdered sugar. It still wasn't overly sweet but it had a great flavored. definately not for pipping but it firmed up in the fridge. Used this frosting with sam's carrots cake.

This recipies is amazing! With just a 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar and a tad bit more vanilla, it was the perfect flavor. My family loved this on top of cherry chocolate cupcakes. I will be makeing this again soon!

Delicious!!  I used this for my carrot cake. I did use honey because I didn't have power sugar. It can out a little on the soupy side, but that was because it was my fault by using the honey. But even with the honey it tasted great. I can't wait to they it again when I have powder sugar on hand!

Made this for a Red Velvet cake.  As suggested by other reviews, I halved the recipe, but added an extra cup of powered sugar, a few drops of lemon, used Philadelphia cream cheese and butter at room temperature  It was the perfect texture, amount and flavor!!!! Even caught my 11 year old daughter licking her plate! ha ha Thank you Janni!

FINALLY a cream cheese frosting where you can taste the cream cheese! If you don't want cream cheese taste, don't make it. The consistency was a wee bit runny, so I used it to first fill my devil's food cupcakes and then do a little embellishment on top. Wonderful!!! I am always disappointed when I taste the store-bought cream cheese frostings.  This one will not disappoint!

Amazing frosting.  I made it just as the recipe is written.  As one reviewer stated, this is a true cream cheese frosting, not that sweet junk you get out of the cans.

I would suggest using it with a sweeter cake or dessert in order to offset the less sweet frosting.  I used mine to top "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" from this site and it was an amazing combination.

This frosting is not something I would suggest for cookies but it might make a great filling for something like whoopie pies.  I used my stand mixer for this so I may have just whipped it up too much, but the consistancy just doesn't seem right for something such as cookies or smaller more delicate type things.

Definitely a winner on carrot cake though!

This is not screamingly sweet frosting. It is perfect with just enough sweetness to accompany, in my case, carrot cake. 
I had taken a tip on using some citrus in this recipe. The added citrus opened this recipe up: the pairing of neufchatel cheese (this is what I had used instead of cream cheese) and the lemon went hand in hand extremely well.  
Instead of using 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, I used 1/2 tablespoon of the vanilla. I had also added 1 teaspoon of lemon zest, and 1 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice. 
I had used this on the Sam's Famous Carrot Cake recipe, to which I had added a few other ingredients too. This frosting is wonderful alone, and especially on this cake!!!
6/17/2011: If you make this frosting alone to eat, you won't be disappointed! So, so good! :-)

A very yummy frosting! I was happy with the sweetness as I was pairing it with a less sweet apple banana muffin, so it evened out well. The texture was great too! Much more smooth then the butter-cream frostings I have used in the past. I will tweak the amount of sugar I add depending on what I need to do with it in the future, but will definitly be using it again.

I hate to leave a bad review, but this recipe is waaaaay too tangy.  The proportion of cream cheese to powdered sugar is way off.  I increased the sugar to 4 cups and added a few teaspoons of milk, to make it a spreading consistency.  It was still not sweet enough for a true cream cheese frosting for a cake.

This is really a fantastically simple and tasty recipe. Since my husband is not fond of overpoweringly sweet, we cut the recipe by 1/2 cup. It has a great cheese flavor and complemented the lemon cupcakes we made!

I love the flavour of this frosting, but had difficulty with the consistency.  It came out rather runny for me.  However, there could be some extra factors as to why this happened.  First I used my hand blender, which I’ve never used for frosting in the past, I usually hand mix with a fork.  Secondly I already had on hand some spreadable light cream cheese so I used that.  As with other frostings I added more confectioner’s sugar, but it didn’t thicken up like I would have expected it to.  I will try this recipe again, just to see if it turns out better and update my review.

This was sooo delicious! However I only gave it 4 stars because I felt it needed an extra cup of confectioners sugar. Otherwise it was great!

A wonderful not-overly-sweet frosting that is easy to prepare.  I followed the original instructions exactly.    I use this frosting in combination with cake made from the Pilsbury Extra-Moist lemon cake mix.

This is delicious. My boyfriend said it was the best frosting he has ever had. 

I was in a bit of a rush so I put the two packages of cream cheese unwrapped on a plate in the microwave for 40 seconds, and did the same with the butter then used the mixer, adding the sugar a half of a cup at a time. Worked perfectly!

sooooo simple and yet absolutely delicious. It was perfect, I did not make any changes to it. I made for red velvet cupcakes and chocolate cupcakes, my husband (not a frosting person) LOVED the frosting.  Big hit on easter and this past christmas. I never could find a perfect frosting, til now.

Delicious! This recipe is great as-is or one time when I made it, I added the juice of half a lemon (at the same time as I added the vanilla) and it gave it just a slight lemony flavor.

Very good and less sweet recipe.    I did need to add additional cup of powered sugar and then added a bit of heavy cream to make it frost easier on the cake and just a little more sweet, but not too sweet as most Cream Cheese frostings are.

Fantastic, and dead simple. This is the frosting for people who--no matter what they're eating--would really secretly rather be eating a cheesecake :D In fact, this recipe made too large a batch, so I added some egg yolks to the leftovers and baked it into a crust for a cheesecake.

Oh yes: I added vanilla bean, and decreased the butter. It does need to be firmed up a bit, but it's heaven.

I made this to put on some cinnamon rolls I made, turned out perfectly.  Only thing I did different was add some orange zest and used orange flavor instead of vanilla.  Tastes amazing!

This is NOT frosting; this is icing. It is very runny. No tricks or tips seemed to improve its consistency. This may be good for cinnamon rolls but not for anything that requires presentation.

I LOVE cream cheese frosting and this is by far the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. Super super easy, I was able to fully frost two 9" cakes and still have enough left over to dye and design the cake with.

By far this is the BEST frosting I have EVER had...EVER! I cut the recipe in half because I'm not too fond of frosting, and half was a perfect amount for a 9x13 size cake. I had to force myself to stop eating it out of the bowl! LOL :o) Great Recipe!

This icing is so AMAZING! It is rich and creamy but not overpowering. All I did to alter it was pour in a dash more of vanilla, but other than that it was FANTASTIC!

Great recipe! I loved the few simple ingredients and quick prep time, however, it came out very thick so i had to add a splash of milk. With the milk it was PERFECT!!!

THE BEST cream cheese frosting.  The vanilla makes it.  I made this for red velvet cupcakes on Valentines Day.  I used the leftovers for cinnamon rolls.  This frosting is perfect for both.

I love cream cheese frosting and I have made this one a few times. The 1st time it was a little to soft for me, the second time I followed a reviewers changes and reduced the cream cheese which made it easier to pipe. It was yummy both times!

I hate giving bad reviews, but I'm going to be honest. My guests liked this, but I will be using different measurements next time.  
I followed the recipe exactly and it ended up being extremely heavy, and thick with the cream cheese. A plus is that it wasn't overly sweet, so I felt I could add another cup of confectioner's sugar, which helped a little. I would suggest using half the cream cheese and maybe more confectioner's sugar. 
This might be good over cinnamon rolls, or as a dip for cinnamon sticks. I wouldn't suggest anyone use it over cake or cupcakes (what I made) because it was too heavy for the cake. I felt like I was eating a cream cheese pudding actually.

Very easy and tastes great!  Here are some tips that would have helped me out when I first made this recipe:

- Before combining the cream cheese and butter, if both are room temperature, it'll save time.  I added my room temp. butter to creamcheese that was colder, and the mixture became very lumpy.  If your mixture looks lumpy, let it sit until it's room temperature.
- If you want a runnier mixture, if you mix it too much it separates a bit.
- If you want a thick consistency for decorating cakes/cupcakes, I added 1/2 cup more butter and added confectioner's 1/2 a cup at a time until it reached the consistency I wanted.  For the last batch I made I added an extra 4 cups.  I didn't have to worry about separating with the thicker consistency.

So creamy and so delicious!!  I added a little yellow food coloring and used this frosting on lemon cupcakes. Then I garnished the tops with fresh lemon zest!!  The absolute best cupcake/frosting combo ever!!

I am giving this two stars because maybe I should have known better. This was not good for decorating purposes. Like others have said, this is so runny you cannot nicely frost with it. This made my cupcakes look runny and sloppy. If you are looking for a nice frosting for a nice presentation - look elsewhere or you will be very disappointed. As for taste, it was good - tastes like cheesecake.

Delicious and easy to make!  The wet ingredients do stick to old school beaters, but once you add the sugar, it turns into a thick creamy frosting.  Wonderful!

The flavor was great! I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, and it was wonderful. Coupled with red velvet cupcakes. The frosting was light and fluffy: simply divine.

Perfect!!  Didn't change a thing.  I used Paula Deen's red velvet cake recipe (with a little extra cocoa) and used this recipe for the icing because I thought her sounded way too sweet.  This was perfect!!  Making them again tonight!

This frosting is FABULOUS! I love the taste of cream cheese and this frosting is the perfect mate to all my favorite cakes! I did however use some of the other users' advice and increased the amount of powdered sugar and vanilla, and decreased the amount of butter. Overall, really good recipe!

Perfect.  I made a half recipe for a spice cake and was plenty for a thick covering on the top - sides not necessary, and then I licked the bowl myself.

Delicious! I also used half the cream cheese and butter (as many others suggested) as well as an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Make sure the cream cheese is softened to room temperature before creaming it with the butter. If it isn't , a quick trip to the microwave for 10 second increments will solve the problem.

Very good and no where as sweet that I thought it was going to be. Must put in the fridge before icing the cakes. Well done.

This was amazing. I halved the recipe and it was enough frosting to cover a 9x13 inch pan. This is real cream cheese frosting. Not the sugary sweet kind.   LOVED IT, THANKS!

I have used this recipe many times and it always turns out well. I have substituted Limoncello Liquor, Rum, Grand Marnier, lemon juice, orange juice, and Biley's Irish Creme for some of the butter (tablespoon for tablespoon) with great success. You can add just about any flavor to this very versitle recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I also only used 1 (8oz.) package of cream cheese and 1/4 c. butter with 1 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla but it is AMAZING!  Finally what I've been looking for as the perfect topping for my carrot cake!

I didn't care for this recipe, it was too cream cheese.  I only used 1 package of cream cheese to start with and still thought it tasted too much like cream cheese.  i'm now looking for a different recipe.

This frosting is PERFECT!!!  I took a reviewer's advice and only used one 8-ounce package of cream cheese to cover one rectangular banana bread cake, but kept everything else the same with the recipe.  Delicious - thanks for sharing!

Great frosting to make with ingredients that are already around the house. Makes a good amount too. We had some left over from a cake and used it for french toast. Very yummy.

Amazing recipe!  Held up wonderfully!  I used this for my daughter's "princess" birthday party, added a little red food coloring and turned it pink.  It was the perfect amount of frosting for cupcakes and went well with chocolate.  Will definitely be using this as a standby for many treats!

yummo!  I have actually never made homemade frosting prior to this (I'm not much of a baker).  This is super easy and comes out creamy and delicious.  I halved the recipe and it was more than enough for 24 cupcakes.  If you want a true cheesecake taste, then follow the ingredients exactly - wonderful frosting!

Love this icing! I did add about a half of a cup more sugar, and I beat on slow the icing sugar into the cream cheese and butter mixture to make it even more creamy.

Wow!! This tasted wonderful!!! I made exactly as recipe specified. It did not spread like typical frosting -- it wasn't quite as fluffy but it still looked pretty good piped on cupcakes. The taste, however, was PERFECT on carrot cupcakes. Mmmmm. Thanks for sharing!

I made this frosting for a special carrot cake recipe and it is absolutely delish! Rather than 2 cups of sugar I used 1 1/2 (based on consistancy as I was mixing) and it turned out beautifully. It wasn't too sweet nor was it too cheesy, it was a lovely balance of the 2 flavors. I can't wait to have a big slice of carrot cake topped with this frosting!

This IS eat w/a spoon worthy!    Classic, simple cream cheese frosting just like it is supposed to be.   Not too sweet - perfect.

I love this recipe because it really tastes like cream cheese.  If you're looking for a more traditional flavor, use only one 8 oz. package of cream cheese.

Wow. Awesome flavor. My whole family loved it. I used this frosting for pumpkin spice mini cupcakes. I first made it just as the recipe said and it was perfect for my taste - just a bit tangy (I did add cinnamon to taste). But I wanted it more like a thick buttercream consistency for piping on the cupcakes so I did add another 3/4 cup of sugar. The consistency was still a bit too soft and I honestly preferred it before adding the extra sugar. Oh well. Next time I will keep it as written. And to those who think it should be sweeter and that's why they add more sugar - just remember. If you wanted a sweet frosting there is always buttercream - cream cheese frosting isn't meant to be so sweet. I will continue to use this recipe again and again! Thanks!

I use this recipe all the time, from cookies to carrot cake to tomato soup cake.  The only thing that I add is milk to change the consistancy depending on what I need it for.  Although just the other day I was experimenting with it and decided to add canned pumpkin to it.  I think I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree.  It made it a bit more creamy, but not to much.  It was fantastic!  I used it to ice my chocolate spice cake.  I highly recommend this for something out of the box.

I had to majorly "doctor" this as it was way too cream cheesey for me. I added 3 times the amount of butter, sugar and vanilla. But it was amazingly light, like a mousse and delicious.

This is the best Cream Cheese Frosting I have found yet!  Although I have given it a 5 star rating, there is one thing that I change.  I really love a bold cream cheese flavor, so I usually start with only 1 cup of sugar instead of 2.  I then add more to taste, but I never put a full 2 cups in the frosting.  Usually for a full cake, I double the recipe as well.  I also love how easy it is to make!!!!

Fantastic! This frosting was a big hit. I used half light cream cheese and half marscapone and definitely loved the result. Prep was easy and only required a bit of re-mixing before it was ready to spread on my sculpted cake. This is my new go-to frosting recipe for sure!

I cut this recipe in half and it turned out great. I do not have a sweet tooth at all, but didn't find this frosting too sweet- a little tangy, but so good. I used it to top home made cinnamon rolls (Clone of a Cinnabon recipe from allrecipes) and it was fantastic!

As much as I love cream cheese, this recipe is too rich for certain desserts such as light and moist pumpkin cupcakes. I would only recommend using a recipe like this w/a very dense cookie or cake. The butter is a nice touch, but 1/2 the cream cheese would have been sufficient. Sometimes less is more. I think if I ever make this frosting again, I'm only going to use a 1/2 stick of butter as well.

I don't understand why people keep complaining about the consistency of this recipe, I thought it was perfect. Obviously don't melt the butter, maybe that's why people keep getting it wrong. I only used 2/3 of the required sugar because I am NOT a fan of super sweet frostings.  Other than that, this is a very basic, but very good recipe.

I used just one package of cream cheese and it turned out great - I use this frosting with red velvet cake to make Cake Balls.

I LOVE cream cheese, so the fact that this is a super cream cheesey recipe is a bit thumbs up for me.  I put this on my carrot cake all the time.  I also tried the chocolate version on a cake for a party, and it was a huge hit.  Awesome icing, for sure.

Very cream cheesy.  Depends on your taste, but I added another 2 cups of powdered sugar and loved the taste and consistency.

I am so grateful to have found this recipe! Thank you Janni for submitting this! It is a REAL cream cheese frosting, exactly what I was looking for. It was PERFECT on my red velvet cake. I heard "Mmmm" coming out of every mouth. Very easy to make and easily adjustable to suit your taste. We added extra cream cheese and powdered sugar until it was just right for us. It is a bit runny but refrigeration helps. I don't think it can get any better than this!

I need to start this off by saying that I LOVE cream cheese but I needed to up the sugar by more than double.  Good idea but without the doubled sugar this wasn't a frosting, it was just a semi-sweet cream cheese spread.

OMG!!! This frosting is to die for! Made it last night to cover a red velvet cake and it was incredible.  So simple and quick to make. I halved the receipe to frost a 9x13 pan and it was the perfect amount. No changes at all. My husband wanted to me to whip up a second batch so he could eat it right then! The texture is perfect, it wasn't runny at all, I did pop it in the fridge while my cake cooled. Will make this on everything from now on. Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a more tart cream cheese frosting to go with my VERY sweet cherry cupcakes, and tried this based on the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (although I suspect it's very forgiving) and it's delicious! I'm saving this recipe forever.

I halved the amounts, and it was perfect for 24 cupcakes. I've also used this on banana cake (9x13). I think it's the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.

This is really good. I did end up adding an additional cup of sugar to sweeten it up. For our taste it just wasn't sweet enough. There was some left over after I frosted my cake so I put some frsoting  between choc. chip cookies and I frooze them for icecream sanwiches. Really good. My husband wants me too make more just for the cookies.

"This is my favorite frosting EVER" said my husband.  "Absolutely" said the birthday girl!  Only used 1/4 cup of butter and 1 1/2 or 12 oz of cream cheese and it was PERFECT!  nom nom nom!  Topped 24 carrot cupcakes with leftovers.

This frosting was AWESOME!  It was so easy to make.  I added 2 - 4 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice and that gave it a nice kick.  I ended up with a lot left over, so I put in in a baggie and stuck it in the freezer.  It was just as good the second time and I didn't have to stir it or anything.  I just spread it on the cake.

This recipe is absolutely perfect.  Easy to make and goes a long way.  For your average bundt cake you may need to cut everything in half, unless you want extra to drop on top of a slice, yum...betty crocker icing has got nothing on this.

Oh my...this is the kind of frosting I can just sit and eat without any cake or cupcake!  I have used this several times, on several kinds of cakes and cupcakes and it is a hit every time.  It is light, fluffy and absolutely to die for.  Thanks Janni for such a wonderful recipe!

I made this frosting for store bought chocolate cupcakes ( I did add some extra stuff to the box stuff though). People raved about it. My husband actually swore these cupcakes were better than the $3 individual cupcakes we had bought from one of those posh cupcake stores days previous. I doubled the recipe (had to make 50 cupcakes for my sons baptism) and it was perfect! You know what too, refrigerate the leftover cupcakes and the next day it tasted even better!

Absolutely divine!  I did end up using 3 cups of powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla because not all of the family loves cream cheese like I do.  I frosted a spice cake with it and everyone loved it.  On my birthday I will be insisting on the original recipe with all that luscious cheesecake flavor!

I made this for a group of people and it was a hit. I only used 1 -8 oz package of cream cheese. Then I followed the rest of the recipe. I was going to add more sugar like others suggested, but after adding 2 cups, it tasted sweet enough for me.

Very good.  Put this on top of a chocolate cake and everyone loved it.  Had to add extra sugar because it wouldn't stay on the cake otherwise. Added even more extra powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit in hopes of decorating with it...it needed a lot of it.  Good tasting frosting but not for decorating purposes.

Great tasting icing! Took the advise from the others about adding an extra cup of icing.

Well, I didn't exactly follow the directions, but the end result is fantastic.  I reduced the cream cheese to 8 oz and increased the sugar to 3 cups.  The rest I left the same.  I also added about a cup of mini chocolate chips.  Used it to frost chocolate cupcakes.  FANTASTIC!

I only had whipped cream cheese but it worked great.  I just needed half a recipe and this worked on a small chocolate cake.

This frosting is sooo good that I can't stop eating it.  I want to make a bowl just to scoop and eat like ice cream.  Gross I know.  My daughter is lactose intolerant so I used the base of this recipe to also make this without real cream cheese using Toffutti Cream Cheese.  Tastes just as good.  Thanks sooo much. Now my DD wants cupcakes all the time.  And it is easy to use to create.

Great, easy recipe (made pumpkin cupcakes). My only issue was that my frosting came out thick, not fluffy. So I added 1 cup more of confectioners sugar and 2T water to it and it was great. Will use again.

Used 3 1/4 cups of sugar I think it makes a world of difference. Love the flavor of the icing, but not sure that I like it on red velvet cake. Will try carrot next time.

This is my new favorite frosting!  I've made it for several different cakes, and it's good on everything.  It turns out just as delicious with low fat cream cheese.  I added a little bit of lemon juice to it when I made a lemon cake, and it was great.

Unfortunately at the time I made this, I was going through my "hate all things creamy or cream based" phase of morning sickness. But the whole family raved! I used it to ice a pumpkin spice cake of my own recipe.

I used this frosting as filler for some chocolate cookies--a recipe I found on this site as well.  It was very creamy and smooth and went well with the dessert.  I was able to put it in a ziploc bag and pipe it on the cookie.  It was very easy.  I will likely try this recipe for other desserts as well.

Love this base recipe! I read the other reviews and also used 3 cups (I have a sweet tooth). Have made it 5 times and EVERYONE raves!!! Love it on all types of cupcakes :) red velvet, etc. I've also found not to overbeat so that it has a better consistency for piping on cupcakes. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious! Only con is it may be too sweet/delicious for your cake. I tried it with a new red velvet recipe i had. It far over-shadowed the taste of the cake.

Very good, but it didn't taste as much like a "frosting" as I wanted. It tasted too much like just plain cream cheese. I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar to get what I was looking for.

This was fabulous! I made it to spread on top of banana bars and it was perfect. The only thing I did wrong was I mixed it by hand so it turned out a tiny bit lumpy but it still tasted wonderful. I will be using this all the time... next time I will be digging out my stand mixer though.

My mom loves carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, so i gave this recipe a try. I added a little extra confectioners sugar to make it thicker, and it came out perfect. I will never buy cream cheese frosting from the store again!!!

The best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. Used it to top red velvet cupcakes and I was tempted to just throw away the cupcake and eat the frosting by itself. Sifting the sugar makes a big difference and the vanilla completes it.

Absolutely delicious!  I added a bit more sugar for my taste.  I have used it on pumpkin bread and red velvet cake with much success from family members.  I agree with the person who said you can eat it by the spoonful, it is that good!  And did I mention super easy?

Absolutely spectacular!!  Went well w/ the red velvet cupcakes (by pinkspoonula) I made today. I did make some adjustments like the other reviewers suggested, because I like my cream cheese icing to be on the sweeter side as well *wink*  I'm so glad that I had left over icing, I'm goin to have to go make a nice little carrot cake to go w/ it :-) yay!  Thanks again for sharing Janni!!

If you're looking for a runny frosting, this is a good recipe.  If you're looking to decorate or frost cupcakes, find a different recipe.  I had to add 2-3 more cups of confectioner's sugar just to make the frosting semi-thick!  Store bought frosting would have worked better.  Very disappointed.

This frosting is so delicious - I added about 1/2 Cup less Confectioner's Sugar because that's all I had, and it is the most delicious cream cheese frosting I've ever had.  Trust me, you WILL lick the beaters!

This is the best frosting I have ever tasted. I didn't us the vanilla and I did not sift the sugar and it was still perfect. I let the cream cheese (kroger brand) and butter get to room temp, then used my trusty Kitchen aid mixer to do the work. It was perfect, easy to spread, carrot cake looks wonderful.

Per other suggestions used 1 (8 oz) cream cheese, 1/2 C butter, 2 cups sifted confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla. I used my hand mixer to make especially creamy, and I used on cupcakes- it was perfect. Next time I will try almond extract.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was using half cream cheese and half mascarpone cheese.  I whipped it up with a hand whisk and it was sweet without being sugary sweet and super light and fluffy.  Will use from now on!

Made this for two layer red velvet cake.  I uped the sugar and the vanilla per recomendation but left everything else alone.  Was wonderful.  Needs to be doubled for full size two layer red velvet.  Next time I will make three smaller layers so the frosting is more pronounced.

It is a quick and easy frosting to make that has a good taste, but at times it can become a little runny and "slimy" so be careful when adding more milk!

A really nice recipe that was extremely easy to make. I used this to top a red velvet cake. I only used 1 1/2 C of confectioners sugar because the frosting was getting really sweet. I think at the 1 C mark, the frosting would be the perfect flavor for topping cinnamon rolls.

Delicious basic recipe, and I like that it is so easy and flexible.  The other reviewers are right, though-- if you want a less cream cheesy frosting, make the butter and cream cheese in equal amounts!

Creamy cream cheese goodness!!!!  I was eating it by the spoonful...  Followed the advice of others, and using only one pkg of cream cheese, added 2 cups powdered sugar and 1/4 c butter.  Simply amazing.

Just perfect for a 9x9 carrot cake for my mom's birthday. Her and her sister (big carrot cake fans) raved about the easy homemade frosting. A very thick consistency makes it seem super decadent, but it wasn't hard to frost and didn't rip at the cake. My favorite part--tasting it off the beaters!

I want to give it 4 1/2 stars since I changed it up.  Only used 1 package cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, used 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 2 cups of the powdered sugar.  It turned out wonderfully.

This was really good. I accidently  added only 1 thing of cream cheese instead of two but it tasted really good still.  All the guest loved it and was the one dessert that went the fastest.

This recipe is pretty good, and super easy to make. I agree that it is a True Cream Cheese Frosting, I did though add about 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar.

i used it to frost sams famous carrot cake and it is awesome!! i made a few changes, i added 3 cups sugar and 2 tablespoons of buttermilk because the consisity was too thick. i also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract to it made it really yummy!!! there was about 1 cup or so left after frosting the cake and decorating (worked great in a pastry bag really easy to use!!) so there is plenty for every size cake, i made a 2 layer 9 inch round cake a+++++ frosting!!

Whoa what a cream cheese punch! This is not for the feint of heart for sure but if you love the flavor of cream cheese this is for you. I like a wide variety of cream cheese frosting, this one was pretty good although not one I would use for anyone but myself. My family and friends tend to like theirs a little more on the subtle side.

I've read a few reviews on this about not being very sweet so I had the extra confectioners sugar on hand to add for sweetness. I have to say- I kept the recipe EXACT and this was amazing!! This is coming from someone who has a major sweet tooth!! I don't think it needed any more sugar!! This tastes amazing and everyone who ate it LOVED it!! It does taste like cheesecake :o) MMmmm!!

This frosting is unbelievably smooth!  The taste is great and the texture is very velvety.  I did add a little milk to loosen it up at first.  I made some banana cupcakes and this was the perfect frosting for them.

I just added an extra cup of powdered sugar to make it more kid-friendly, and it was the best frosting I have ever tasted! Like a reviewer before me said, you can definitely eat it straight out of the bowl. Yum!!

I used this to top the Pumpkin Cake III Recipe from here and it was a delicious combination. I took another reviewer's advice by adding an additional cup of confectioners sugar and doubled the vanilla extract to make it sweet. The combination was a big hit. This has become part of our family recipe collection.

This was a little to thick to spread nicely, so I added 1/2 cup of milk into it and it seemed to smooth it out.  Very good taste.  I I used it on banana bars.

Pretty good, a little too cream cheese for us, so I tried PABBYDOG's recommendations & liked it better.  To make it even better another level I used the modified (pabbydog) version, added 1/4 cup of instant jello (any flavor, I used strawberry)... not only did I get the color I wanted, but loved the nice strawberry twist it added.  Am making a garden theme party for my daughter & will also make a second batch using lime for "grass" color.

Don't rate this based on adding more sugar!! That would be a different recipe.  This is a fine recipe if you don't want a sweet frosting, but it should say that in the description.

I used the recommendation to add cocoa and it was very good. It is very creamy and almost tangy due to the amount of cream cheese, but it paired well with my rich chocolate cake with strawberry filling. Overall, very good.

I whipped this for several minutes so it was nice and fluffy.  I don't know if you get the same effect unless you use a KitchenAid or commercial mixer.  It was almost just like Cinnabon's frosting, except I think they have a touch of salt and lemon in theirs.  YUM!

As everybody else is saying, this is a fantastic and really easy to make recipe. I personally think adding an extra cup of confectioner's sugar is a little much, but if that's what does it for you, then okay. I followed the recipe and got a wonderfully sweet and tangy frosting. A trick to help get the cream cheese and butter started, besides just having them both softened, is adding a dash of milk or cream - it makes it all a lot easier.  I used this on top of a German-style Apple Cake, and topped it with homemade caramel. This frosting really helped make the cake. Thanks for posting!

Loved the frosting. Wanted to just eat it out of the bowl. Only needed 1/2 a recipe for 13 x 9 cake. Nice and spreadable - use more conf sugar if you want it stiffer. I used 2 cups - we like it sweeter, but it was really good with only 1 cup.

I learned that you really need to softern the butter or else you will get a lot of lumps of butter. but this was a great recipe! I used only 8oz. of cream cheese and 8.oz of whipped cream to lighten it up, and it was so scrumptious. I had made it to put on the Idaho Potato Cake, (made it for my class) and every one in the class loved the recipe.

I halved this recipe to frost a 9x13 pan of pumpkin bars (Pumpkin Bars I on this website). Very easy to make, creamy and sweet frosting with a bit of a tang to the taste. Would work well with carrot cake too! Very good.

Great frosting!  Not too sweet or too heavy.  I used this on some lemon cupcakes and it turned out great.  Very good consistency for either spreading or piping.  I spread the leftover frosting on some graham crackers.  Love it!

I made some alterations. I used 1/4 cup of butter as suggested by another reviewer, and I used more 3 8-oz packets of cream cheese because I made a 3-layer chocolate cake for my daughter's birthday celebration. I also made another alteration. I used only 1 cup of the powdered sugar, because I added sweetened coconut as an additional topping/garnish, and I did not need the additional cup of sugar. My mother brought a 'professional' cake from the bakery where she lives, and everyone left the 'professional' baked cake and  reached for my cake. Thanks for sharing this wonderful frosting recipe with us!!!

I used only 1 pkg. of cream cheese but otherwise followed the recipe.  It seemed to be just the right amount of sweetness for Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (which I made into cupcakes).  There's more than enough frosting for two and a half dozen cupcakes.

I use this recipe everytime I make a carrot cake and it is hands down,the best tasting/texture!  I whip the cream cheese and butter first, then add the vanilla, then add the sugar a bit at a time until it hits the desired sweetness.  A "you can't lose" frosting!! Thank you!!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a frosting that wasn't too sweet.  It was very good and had a nice smooth consistency.  It was, however, very heavy on the cream cheese(not a bad thing!) and didn't have that typical fluffy texture one expects in a frosting.  Maybe more of the sugar would have helped?  I used this to frost a 9x13 cake and there was plenty.  I wouldn't however, use this for cupcakes...I think it was a little too soft.

Everyone loves this icing!  I have made it plenty of times for our cupcake parties, and it always comes out absolutely delicious!   I also used only 1 8 oz cream cheese - that was plenty.. and upped the vanilla to 2 tsp. Recipe is a keeper!

Good basic cream cheese frosting. VERY strong cream cheese flavor. I did up the powdered sugar to 3 1/2 cups in order to meet my in-laws' preference for sweet cream cheese frosting. Otherwise, this is not a "sweet" frosting. Will use again. Oh yes, it made plenty to ice a whole cake and then some!

Easy to make. Wow! not too sweet, creamy and very flavorful. This is a fabulous recipe, as good as any restaurant. I halved it and frosted the middle and top of Sam's famous carrot cake and I am going to try it next on Downeast Pumpkin bread. Thanks Janni.

EXCELLENT FROSTING!  I put in an extra cup of powdered sugar like others had suggested!  The frosting thickened just right!  I used this recipe for my Red Velvet cupcakes.  My boyfriend took it to his retreat and they LOVED it!  They couldn't believe the frosting was home made!

This is perfect - I didn't actually measure the powdered sugar, but I bet I used more than called for, for the right consistency.

I decided to double the amount of sugar and vanilla, and turned out a little too sweet for a carrot cake, so next time I will make the recipe as is, I am sure it will be perfect!  Using only half of the recipe was the exact amount for a 9" double layer cake. Thank you! UPDATE: I followed the recipe exactly and turned out excelent! Half of the recipe made enough for 24 mini cupcakes and 8 regular cupcakes, with very little left over, thanks!

The flavor is good, but the consistency is way too thin for me-- it came out more like a glaze than a frosting as the recipe is.  I added powdered sugar (not sure how much) until the consistency was thicker, and have it in the fridge now, hoping it thickens up while I wait for the cake to bake and cool.

Delicious frosting.  The consistence was still a little to thin to do much decorating with, but the flavor was fabulous.   *UPDATE* I just made a lemon cookie with powdered sugar coating and sandwiched the cream cheese icing between two cookies.  It was awesome!

Delicious; so easy and perfect piping consistency! I LOVE this frosting! I halved it to decorate 24 cupcakes. I didn't quite have enough sugar, so I added lemon zest of one lemon and juice of 1/2 a lemon for a little extra flavour- really good!!!

The frosting tasted really good. I followed another user's advice and used only 1 package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teasp. of vanilla. I also used MUCH MUCH more sugar because I wanted a thicker frosting. The end result was very tasty and not too sweet. I cut it with some salt and towards the end used a little cornstarch too.

doesn't get any simpler and works well for decorating. I don't like the taste of plain frosting so I always use cream cheese.

I LOVE this recipe! I ate alot of it while my cupcakes were baking it was so good! Then again I really like cream cheese so i can understand how some people who don't love it so much would think the flavor was too strong. I used it on chocolate chip cherry filled cupcakes and it was GREAT! It tasted like cherry cheesecake mmmmm :)

Great taste!! Read some reviews that said not sweet enough or too much cream cheese, totally have to disagree, I was ready to add more sugar but it is not necessary. I did add just a hint of lemon zest. I had a bit of trouble with the consistency but I think that was me not the recipe so it deserves 5 stars. Used it on Sam's Carrot Cake, also from this site, DELICIOUS!!

Oh my Gosh! This is toooo good! Not too sweet and really creamy. This is by far the best frosting I have ever had. The only problem is we can't stop eating it and we haven't frosted our cupcakes yet....

Followed the recipe as it is with another extra 50g of cream cheese. I served it as the frosting on crazy cake. My family and I find it a bit too sweet though. Will cut down on the sugar next time. Anyway, I believe it's a good one with less sugar.

Yummy!  And super easy--gotta love easy! I halved the recipe..because my little brother ate the other package of cream cheese---uggg!  But it made alot-- the vanilla made it ;look a little dingy--so maybe next time no vanilla.

It's like a standard carrot cake frosting. I added it on pumpkin spice cookies and my sister said they tasted like carrot cake - hey that's fine with me! My dad who hates cream cheese even liked it! Oh, but I only used 1 - 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, and 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla.  Thanks a lot :)

Like other reviewers, I cut the cream cheese down to just one 8 oz container. Used little less than 2 cups of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla. So delicious! I can't wait to try this flavored with other extracts, I think it would be great with rum or almond flavor.

For Chocolate Cake glaze -- Use only one pkg. (8oz) cream cheese, 1/4 C. butter, and 1 C. powd. sugar.  NO VANILLA.   Spread on cake immediately while hot from the oven.  WOW!!!

Rich, Creamy, Spreadable and Easy!! This is the only cream cheese frosting recipe I found with this much cream cheese in it... wouldn't want any other way! Very versatile, can be used on many types of cakes. Restaurant quality IMHO.  It's a keeper!

I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract just like Truckerdoo did. She/He said that it was even taste better.. hmmm not for me.. tasted sour and ull really taste the almond extract. (Truckerdoo - I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and it was even better. :)") Maybe if u use almond extract dont use 1tsp.. use 1/2 or 1/4 tsp. OR just stick to the original recipe!! I made a chocolate cake and used this recipe for my friends bday party.. i just hope the chocolate cake will over power the frosting! ;)But i will try this recipe again.

Wow! This frosting is so good. It will make anything you put it on taste amazing. Super easy to make. It is quite rich as is if you want a lighter frosting I would use half the cream cheese.

I could eat spoon-fulls of this frosting!  Some reviewers were saying to only use 8 oz instead of 16 oz of cream cheese, so I split the difference.  I used a 12oz container of Philadelphia's whipped cream cheese, which was already soft and so easy to blend with a mixer.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and the end result was the best-tasting frosting I've had in years.

This recipe is good, but I made some adjustments. I used only one 8 oz package of cream cheese, and 1/4 cup butter. I found the 2 cups powdered sugar to be the perfect amount, but doubled the vanilla. Then it was perfect! Just the right amount of cream cheese and sweetness I wanted. I used it on a yellow cake topped with strawberries and blueberries and it was great! Just the right amount of frosting for a 13x9 size cake.

I had no butter, so I had to use margarine. It still tasted fantastic though! If you use margarine, you may have to add additional powdered sugar to reach a thicker consistency.

Perfect classic cream cheese frosting. It's very spreadable..so not of decorating consistancy...maybe good for some piping work. I did manage to get a shell w/ it after chilling it a bit. Great flavor and not too sweet. I cut the recipe in half. :)

This has the best taste! It's like a cheesecake on your cake! You have to refridgerate it before frosting anything b/c it is runny at first. I let it chill for about 30 mins or so.

Love this frosting! It's rich and has a creamy texture that's different from most frostings. I made it using 16 oz of fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of confectioners sugar along with the vanilla, and low fat margarine and it was luscious! I was surprised that my husband, who prefers chocolate frosting absolutely loved this as well. Also both my stepsons thought it was wonderful. Taste and texture are both excellent!

This is divine.  Agree with others that it is not sweet icing and has the cream cheese flavor, but that's what I was looking for when I tried this recipe.  Incredibly easy to make and everyone at my daughter's birthday party raved.  Will never use store bought again.

I don't know if it was because I used nefuchatel instead of full-fat cream cheese, but this frosting turned out runny and not at all rich tasting.  It also wasn't terribly sweet.  I used this on some red velvet cupcakes and only 3 got eaten.

Very, very easy to make. I used an entire 8oz. pkg of cream cheese and reduced the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup.  Then....I added some cocoa mix.  I didn't have "pure cocoa", so I used the Nestle mix I had on had.  WOW! It taste like a Milky Way!!  I will use this base recipe for many years to come. Thanks

This was so easy, and delicious. I halved the recipe except for the vanilla. Delicous to frost a 9 inch single layer cake, but the leftovers turned my "cake pops" into something gourmet. YUM!

I used this to frost a 3 layer red velvet cake.  I ran out of frosting and had to make an extra 1/2 recipe.  I didn't care for the end result.  It was nice looking there was just something about the taste I didn't like.  I can't put my finger on it.  I thought it was a pretty standard recipe.  I used premium ingredients, it just didn't taste right.

Awsome easy recipe. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I took other's advice and used one 8 oz pkg cream cheese, 1 1/2tsp vanilla and 2 cups of sifted confectioner's sugar and it turned out perfect just the right amount for a 9 X 12 pan cake. Can't wait to serve my carrot cake to my company tonight.

I can see how this frosting is really good, but I had to make a few changes because I ran out of powdered sugar.  I used 4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and about 1 cup of powdered sugar.  It was rich and still very good!  Used it on the Iced Pumpkin Cookies from this site.

This was definitely not sweet enough. I also thought the consistency was a little runny, so I added an extra cup of powdered sugar, and it is perfect. I understand it is a cream cheese based recipe, but its also a frosting and it should be sweet! As written it would probably be perfect for a danish or something.

I used this recipe on some regular mix cupcakes and it turned them into something fantastic! I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough cupcakes to need the full amount, in fact I would say this recipe makes a lot more frosting than you need, at least for cupcakes.
First, let me say I had absolutely NO problem with the consistency. I used softened cream cheese and beat in the vanilla, then added the softened butter in small amounts, though I used slightly less butter than the recipe calls for. Then I added the sugar a little at a time. As soon as the first 1/4 cup was mixed in, it looked like perfect frosting, with a thick consistency and a shiny texture. I added as much sugar as it needed to get the taste I was going for - for my halved version, it was somewhere around 3/4 cup.
And it only took a couple minutes to make! I'll definitely use this again. 5 stars!

I cut the recipe in half and had lots for my gingerbread cake.  I thought it was just enough cream cheese taste.  My sister took one lick and said "HOW MUCH BUTTER IS IN THAT ICING!??"  To clarify, she liked it, just thought it tasted super rich.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than halving it.  Would use again, maybe adding a hint of lemon or orange for a different flavour.
Quite good.

A great cream cheese frosting.  It had a wonderful taste and was just what I was looking for to put on my pumpkin cookies. I will add that the texture is very soft. It was perfect for frosting my cookies but it would be hard to frost the sides of a cake and expect it to say in place, but it would be good if you out it on a sheet cake or between layers. It is so soft you could dip cupcake into it to frost them, and much easier. NOTE: This frosting stays soft and sticky, it does not crust over.  You could also add extra sugar to make it thicker.  Plus to add, I ran out of Powdered sugar as I was making this so I put 1 C. of granulated sugar into my coffee grinder and ground it to a fine powder. It worked perfectly and I didn't have to run to the store for one cup of powdered sugar. :-) It would not do this for a lot of powdered sugar but for this small amount it worked well.

Search no further.  This is a true "cream cheese" frosting.  No modifications needed.  People I work with beg me to make any cake I like as long as I put this cream cheese frosing on it.

Perfect cream cheese frosting! And it had been so hard for me to find one with just the right amount of cheese flavour / sweetness... Thanks!

Very good. I thinned it out with some milk to achieve glazing consistancy and put it on some pumpkin cookies.

Yup, this was a keeper. I love the "less sweet/more cheesy" taste. Really like having a cheesecake topping for your cake. Used it on Jan's Chocolate Cake, which was super dense and rich, and together they were almost too rich, but hey, once it a while you just gotta layer it on.

Substitute lemon flavoring for the vanilla and use it to frost a lemon cake.... SUPER YUMMY. This is some of the best frosting I've had in a long time.

Good recipe... I changed it a bit to suite my needs. 
1 - 8oz. container tofutti cream cheese
1/4 cup earth balance
3/4 cup powered sugar
splash of vanilla

this is soooo good. for any of you lactose-intolerant friends out there. nothing is lost by replacing a few items. try it!

I hate frosting but I liked this.  Usually I think frosting is so sickenly sweet.  But I used this on a carrot cake and it went great.  If you like more of a cream cheese taste that doesnt taste like sigar I recomment this.  I broke my mixer though so mixing this by hand was not fun.

...I'm not sure what happened here, but I didn't think this frosting was anything special. I made it exactly as written and was really saddened. I'm not even sure I'm going to put them on Paul's Pumpkin bars because it's just so... blah. It's definitely missing something. More sugar maybe? It was fairly runny and not very distinctive in taste. I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I don't like cream cheese frostings, finding them sticky and "cheesey"  Cheese belongs on a cracker, not on a cake. I made this recipe at the request of the birthday boy, and was astonished to discover that it's OUTSTANDING!   It's rich, not overly sweet, and decadently smooth.  Recommended!

i would give this recipe 5 stars with the changes but only 4 as written.  I took advise from other reviewers and halved the amounts of cream cheese and butter.  It was absolutely perfect.. wonderful consistency and easy to spread. Although i havn't tried it as written, it seems like it would be way too much cream cheese.

i tried this for my son's 1st b-day cake and i was little nervous about the frosting being running (because that what some of the other reviewers said). so i put the box of cream, beaters and the bowl in the freezer while i whipped the sugar and cheese cream, then mixed in the heavy cream. the frosting was perfect for icing a two layer b-day cake and tasted amazing. the taste was very light and summery. will be frosting cakes w/t this many many more times

The previous reviews were right, this is not a super sugary overly sweet frosting but it is delicious and is something you won't find in a store!!  I used this on cinnamon rolls and it tasted amazing!  I reduced the amount of butter and only used on pack of cream cheese, upped the sugar and vanilla a bit and it came out wonderfully.

This recipe is -definitely- for those who like actual cream cheese taste to their frosting. I added about 1/2 of a teaspoon extra vanilla and 1/2 of a cup extra confectioner's sugar and it came out -superb.-  It tastes like very creamy cheesecake.

5 stars all the way. I made up a huge batch of this frosting and added cocoa to some of it. The frosting was great both ways. I'll never buy canned again!

this is the perfect cream cheese icing! i made this to go with the "carrot cupcakes with White Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing" because i don't like white chocolate. i don't know how that icing is, but this one is perfect! not to sweet, and still has the tang of cream cheese. yummy!

Gorgeous! I actually multiplied the recipe by 1&1/2 but only used about 2 1/2 cups of sugar. It's sweet enough so I didn't want to add more. It's not glazy at all and my kitchen is HOT right now. Nice and creamy and thick and delicious on my cupcakes.

After reading the reviews, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of butter, 2 cups of confectioners' sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla.  This produced the perfect amount to frost two dozen cupcakes.  The flavor of the frosting was excellent, but I found it to be a little runny.  But overall, it was a good recipe.

This is a great frosting but it did have a very strong cream cheese taste and I tend to like frostings more sweet. I had halved the recipe b/c I only made one round cake, after mixing and taste tasting added another cup of powdered sugar to sweeten it up... but very good recipe all the same... just depends on what you like! I hate using the store bought icings/cake mixes b/c of all the  they use in them so this was a nice find. I used this with Dark Chocolate Cake I and it turned out well. Lots of compliments. Thanks for the good recipe.

I love this recipe! It was was easy to make and delicious.  I used the frosting for lemon-cheese cup cakes and it goes together so well.  I garnished the top of each cup cake with a few sprinkles of lemon zest. It made me look like a pro in the kitchen. Thank you.

This was awesome. I did make the whole recipe and found that it was too much for one cake. But the rest was really good on my bagel the next few mornings after. Thankyou for a recipe that is definally a keeper.

This frosting has a soft cream cheese flavor(I also added the zest and juice of one lemon)and isn't sugary at all. My dessert plate usually has a pile of uneaten frosting which I've scraped from my cake but not this time.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but my frosting was totally runny. I kept adding sugar, but nothing helped. I had made it for our Easter dessert, a carrot cake shaped like a bunny. We called it the "Runny Babbit"!

This recipe was perfect.  I put it on my carrot cake.  Made a generous amount.  Nice and smooth and creamy.  I added just a few drops of milk to thin it out.

I loved it, I made the carrot and walnut cake for Easter and used this frosting, it was incredible. The only thing I did differently was I added two tsp of vanilla instead of one. Thanks for posting this recipe, I will make again.

This was absolutely delicious! I doubled the vanilla and added 1TBS cream. It was creamy cheesecake goodness. Spread left overs onto fresh strawberries or cinnamon/sugar graham crackers.

Excellent frosting recipe and you can just add more sugar if it's not sweet enough, which is what I found, but it's to each their own taste!

This recipe was perfect as written. Beautiful creamy texture that tastes so yummy - exactly like cheescake. The only thing i did differently was to add a little lemon juice. Such a subtle difference bt you'll notice it. Thanks for a great recipe. It will go in my journal for sure.

This is amazing! Can't say enough how excellent the flavors and ease of making is. Can use it on so many things! I topped with homemade cinnamon rolls and will use on carrot cake or certain muffins as well. Very sweet (which I love). I used low fat cream cheese to attempt some observation of being calorie conscious..haha..thanks!

Turned out great.  I kept some white, added pink dye to some and cocoa to the rest.  I liked the chocolate the best but the kids enjoyed all three flavors on their cupcakes :)

WOW!!!  This frosting is the absolute best.  You really can't mess it up, either!  I used a little less than 2 blocks of Neufchatel cream cheese (all I had on hand), a stick of unsalted butter and the vanilla... I didn't really measure the powdered sugar, just kept sifting it in the bowl, mixing, and adding to taste.  It tastes wonderful!  I'm using it to top cupcakes made from the Strawberry Cake II from this site.

Pretty darn good!  I actually cut the recipe down for serving of 6 because that's all the cream cheese I had and seen as how it's -48 celcius today I didn't want to go out!  It whipped up really easy  (and very quick) and I just added more icing sugar to taste.  Used it on mini carrot muffins and it satisfied my craving perfectly!!!  Thanks so much!

Fantastic recipe.  I made mine into strawberry cream cheese frosting by pureeing about 8 strawberries with just a touch of water....straining the seeds and mixing the "juice" into the frosting. Had to give out the recipe since my guests loved it so much!

Delicious!  We like our frosting a little sweeter, so I added an extra cup of confectionary sugar and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  I paired the frosting with the apple banana cupcakes for my son's first birthday.

Delcious!  I paired this with the carrot cake cupcakes from this site and the frosting absolutely made the cupcakes.  Oh my gosh -- this is so good!  I brought the cream cheese and butter to room temperature and then I just put everything in my stand mixer and let it mix.  The longer it mixes for, the fluffier it becomes.  This will be my only recipe for cream cheese frosting that I use in the future!

This recipe is fantastic and so easy to make! Makes me wonder why anyone would ever buy ready made frosting again! I know I won't evera again. Made this to go along with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake from this site and talk about heavenly. I already have requests for a second cake, the first one didn't make it through the night! Thanks Janni for sharing this yummy recipe!!

So so good.  I used 1/3 the fat cream cheese, and it was still really good.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Simple, basic and quick cream cheese frosting recipe. Flavors and color of this frosting could be changed (i.e. add fresh lemon juice with some yellow food coloring etc.)

The best cream cheese frosting I have come across. As others have stated, this is not overly sweet. Ideal for carrot or spice cakes. If super sweet frosting is more to your liking, just adjust the amount of sugar added. Thank you for a great recipe!

Very cream-cheesy!  I usually cut it in half, since this recipe makes quite a bit.  Half is enough to lightly frost 24 scones.

Delicious.  I use reduced fat cream cheese (not that it really matters with the calories in a recipe like this!) and it still tastes very good.  Works great with carrot cake and pumpkin cake.

EASY - and has a great flavor.  ...not too sweet - I agree that this is definitely the frosting for folks who like the cream cheese flavor.  I used this twice now on pumpkin cakes... the outcome is delicious, and I always get extra comments on the frosting.

This is a great recipe - it's exactly what you'd expect a good cream cheese frosting to be.

Just as an aside, this is great on Betty Crocker's Butter Pecan cake.

This is the best frosting I have ever made! And so simple to make. Definatey make sure the cream cheese is room temperature. Next time I may try a different flavored extract like almond.

A true cream cheese frosting! Very delicious. I added about 1/2 cup extra sugar to sweeten it up a bit as I'm serving it to people who like sweeter stuff but it is honestly wonderful the way it is.

This might sound wierd, but add a teaspoon of fresh lime juice and some lime zest.  It gives it a nice tang and cuts the sweetness of the frosting.

I used this to frost my pumpkin raisin spice bar cookies.  It mixed up in the food processor in less than a minute and was wonderful.  I didn't have vanilla on hand, so I thinned it a little with 1/2 and 1/2.  Excellent!

Absolutely loved this recipe. It's perfect with Texas Red Velvet Cake. It's not too sweet so you can decorate the cake with all kinds of extras (icing,jelly beans,gumdrops,etc) that may be sweet.

Pretty good, more cream cheese than other recipes, which I like. I frosted a red velvet cake with it and it was pretty good. The frosting was actually better than the cake :) Spread out nicely on the cake, and looked pretty.

Used this with the "Strawberry Cake from Scratch" recipe from this site.  It was excellent.  Several family members don't care for overly sugary icing and they all loved this.

This was great as it is. We don't like super-sweet icings and it made more than enough for me to make anither cake tonight! I also left the butter + cream chesse on the counter top for about 1.5 hours to soften up. My K.A. mixer had no problems making a smooth and light icing.

The only reason this one doesn't have 4 stars is that I, too, had a little bit thinner consistency that desired.  However, with just the amount of confectioners sugar called for, it was plenty sweet and tasted heavenly!  I made banana cupcakes and even added about half a ripe banana to half the batch to ice the cupcakes- delicious!!

This is a great frosting, and very cream cheesey. It is not too sweet and spreads well. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature of course, to avoid lumps. My husband has asked me to make this frosting and I looked at at him and said "Oh? And what would you like me to put it on?" He said he didn't really care what it was on!

I used this recipe on the "Carrot Cake III" recipe from this site and let me just say - match made in heaven!  I love this recipe.. it's thick and creamy and not so sweet, but sweet enough.  It completely complimented the carrot cake instead of overpowering it.  The only reason for 4 stars is because it's so thick that it's quite difficult to actually frost the cake without pulling the cake apart.

The consistency varies each time I make it. I think it has to do with the amount of beating that takes place. I beat the cheese with vanilla first until smooth as RALWATTAR suggested and it helps with any clumping of cheese. I also add more powdered sugar for chocolate cakes and less for carrot or bar type cakes. I've only used it on a sheet cake and cupcakes so I don't know how this "thinner" consistency icing would fair on that. Thanks so much for sharing such a delicious and versatile icing! I just LOVE the cream cheese taste!!

Yum!  This is my new favorite 'go to' recipe.  I made this last Sunday for my brother's birthday cake and it was perfect.  I threw it on a yellow cake with a fresh strawberry mash. It was a really easy recipe, but does make a ton- I could've frosted two cakes!  But I'll be more than happy to try out the rest on some spice or carrot cupcakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a not too sweet, "cheesy" tasting frosting and this is it! I would have liked if it was just a little fluffier, as it is very soft, but I will use this recipe again. Edited to add. I have used this recipe 3 times since and it is really a hit! The texture really improves overnight in the fridge. Just don't leave it on the counter too long. Really yummy tasting

Very good, but a little too cheese-cakey for what I was looking for.  This is very rich!  And make sure that your 'softened' cream cheese is totally to room temperature, especially if mixing by hand, as the lumps are tough to smoosh out.  Would probably be very tasty on some chocolate or lemon drop cookies. :-)

I LOVED this frosting!  It had excellent flavor.  I used it on cinnamon rolls, and because I had so much left over, I made a spice cake and put the frosting on top.  I would definitely cut this recipe in half if you are only making cinnamon rolls or one cake--it makes so much.

very cream cheesy flavored.  I spread it over thick rich brownies & added raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries.  Everybody thought it was a cheese cake topping and they all said they loved it.  but I thought the cream cheese flavor kind of stole the show.  Just a warning:  very cream cheesey!

I didn't really like this recipe. I like my cream cheese frosting to be sweeter. The cream cheese taste was a little too strong for me. I only did one 8oz cream cheese but doubled the powder sugar and vanilla.

The frosting was extremely easy to make! 
A HUGE tip though, I accidentally used salted butter in my frosting so the end result was really salty!! :( 
The frosting was pretty liquidy at one point, so I just stuck it in the fridge and the problem was fixed! 
Mine had a strong cream cheese smell to it. :)

This was really good.   I just wanted to post that I ended up scaling this recipe down to 6 servings (1/4 of the recipe) because I had only 1/2 package of cream cheese left and still had enough to put a 1/4 inch layer of frosting on top of two eight inch square cakes. I just thought I'd let you know in case you wanted to make the least amount of frosting that you need or you have less than 1 package of cream cheese.

This frosting is fabulous!  We do not like frosting that is too sweet, and this was perfect for our tastes.  I used it to frost the Best Carrot Cake Ever from this site, and the only problem was that I ran out of frosting and had to make more to finish the cake. My lack of frosting experience was to blame for that, I am sure.

I really like the flavor of this frosting.  I only had 12 oz cream cheese, so tried to adjust the sugar.  No it is not a stiff frosting, but it tasted great with chocolate cake.  It really complimented it.  I hate sugary grocery store type frosting, so this was perfect for me!

This frosting was fantastic. I accidentally added twice the butter, but it was amazing anyway.

I cut the recipe down a bit since I was only frosting a small single layer cake.  However, I ended up adjusting it so much in order to get the desired consistancy that I had way more than I needed anyway.  The frosting tasted great though so I'm happy that I have some for later use, since I froze what was left over.  This is one of those recipes where you don't have to worry about being so exact with the measurements because you just adjust it to the way you like it and to suit whatever you are serving it with, by adding more or less of certain ingredients (which in this case, is basically the confectioners sugar).  This frosting was much softer than I expected (no matter what I did to it) so dont expect to pipe with it.  If you want to decorate with it, I would suggest using whipped cream cheese frosting as that would be much easier to work with.

By the way, I used a light cream cheese, which I highly recommend.  There's a stick of butter in this frosting so youre not sacrificing any taste by using a reduced fat version or even neufachatel. (I dont think theres that big of a taste difference between the 2 cream cheeses anyway)

I was a bit afraid to attempt a homemade frosting. This recipe is so easy! It is delightful on carrot cake. I think everyone enjoyed the frosting more than the cake!

Great frosting!  I just used it for some red velvet cupcakes.  This recipe generously frosts 24 cupcakes.

I added about 1/2c more of the sugar as I was mixing, as well as 1T more vanilla for a more intense vanilla flavor.

Follow up:  I think this frosting keeps better if you store your frosted item in a cooler place, like a cool pantry or fridge.  I left mine out in the kitchen and the butter in the frosting seems to make it melt a bit if it's warm.

A good frosting for the size carrot cake I baked (Best Ever Carrot Cake by Nan). But I had to add at least a cup or two more sugar (okay more like 3!) to get it to the consistency I needed (a carrot cake isn't finished without decorating it with frosting carrots!) I also added a little sour cream to give the frosting more of a tangy flavor. I would suggest playing around with this recipe to get it just right for whatever cake one chooses. Thanks for the submitting this recipe!

I put in double the vanilla and used half low fat cream cheese and half regular. The consistency was a little difficult, likely because of my modifications, and I ended up having to add more powdered sugar which made it very sweet. Despite the little setbacks, it was RIDICULOUSLY delicious and I had a very hard time not eating it all before I iced the cake! I'll stick to the recipe next time.

Fabulous.  Really easy to make, perfect frosting for carrot cake.  One recipe was perfect for a 13 x 9 sheet cake, would double the recipe if I was making a layer cake.  Thank you for sharing!

Oh my gosh!  I have finally found the BEST cream cheese icing recipe ever! However I did make a couple changes. Instead of using regular cream cheese I used the light version just to help  lower the calories.  I also used approx 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice, however you can also use just a tsp of the bottle lemon juice if you don't have a real lemon!  Yummy!

Really a good taste, but waaaaay too thin.  After the initial 2 cups of powdered sugar, I ultimately ended up adding 3 more cups...and it still just slid off a  carrot cake that I worked 2 hours on (which is supposed to be a gift).  No matter how much powdered sugar I added, it didn't thicken up.  Might be a better frosting for one layer things, but NOT for a 2 layer cake.  What a mess.

I could have eaten the whole bowl of frosting without the cake it was so good.  Make sure that your cream cheese is REALLY soft or it leaves lumps.

Not what I would expect cream cheese frosting to taste like, but still so good that I ate half the bowl with a spoon! I put it in the refrigerator before frosting with it and it worked fine.

Makes a wonderful frosting.  If it's too runny when you get it all whipped up all you have to do is set it in the fridge for 20 minutes.  It cools to a wonderful consistency!!!  My kids didn't like it because it wasn't "sweet enough" for them, but that's why I used it!  I will use this again and again!  I frosted the "one bowl chocolate cake III" from this site with it.  Wonderful!

Excellent blend of cream cheese and powdered sugar. This recipe is not too sweet, and mixes to a wonderful consistency - it's really easy to spread. I used this recipe to frost the Plain Eggless Cake (recipe on this site) - since the cake had orange juice in it, I added some orange zest to the frosting recipe. It was delicious! With this amount of frosting, I frosted two 9-inch layer cakes and a bundt cake. I will be using this recipe again and again. I can't wait to make a carrot cake now!

Something not quite right. I think maybe it wasn't sweet enough for my taste. It had too strong of a cream cheese flavor for my liking. I might try it again but add more sugar next time.

i ran out of vanilla extract so ended up using almond extract instead. i used all the right quantities but it was a bit too runny so i had to add about 1/3 cup flour to thicken it up. tasted ok. will definately make sure i have enough vanilla next time though!

Never made this before but it was so simple and delicious. Topped the "carrot cake" recipe from this site. Make sure your butter is warm and soft tho or you end up with bits of butter all mixed through it. Added a bit more sugar as others recommended. Delicious.

This was fabulous! My husband & I are not big fans of sugary frosting, so I'm so glad I tried this recipe. I added a little allspice, which gave it a little extra decoration & flavor.

No more searching, this is a keeper!  I customized the recipe to 12 and iced a 9 x 13 perfectly (Cathy's banana bread from this site).  Everybody loved it - can't wait to make a carrot cake!  Thanks.

This frosting is excellent! I love how you can taste the cream cheese as the sugar doesn't overpower it. I really like how the frosting sets when refrigerated. I use this recipe all of the time for cookies, cakes, etc. Pretzels are even great dipped in it!

This frosting is delicious. I had enough to frost 28 cupcakes of the Carrot Cake V and even had some left over. As someone else pointed out, the cream cheese to sugar ratio is perfect. This is so easy to make and delicious. I received many compliments! UPDATE: This recipe is enough to frost two 9" round cakes stacked, or the tops of two 13 x 9 cakes.

This was just ok in my opinion.  I followed the instructions perfectly.  The frosting came out runny.  It tastes good.  I believe it has too much cream cheese in it.  When I try this again I will 12 oz of cream cheese instead of 16 oz.  Also, I did NOT MELT the butter and cream cheese, I softened it.  I also, put the frosting in the refrigerator for an hour before I used it.  It warmed up quickly and was runny.

I had the same experience as some others, in that it was a little too tangy and runny for my taste, but it was very good all the same. I had to keep adding more and more confectioners sugar to get it to a consistency where it wouldn't slide down the cake. Perhaps if I spread it over a sheet cake (I was frosting a layer cake) it would have sufficed. I would use this recipe again as a guideline, with adjustments.

Needed about 1/2 cup extra sugar to make it a little less tangy.  Other then that it was great.  I halved the recipe for a 9x13 cake.  Perfect amount!!!

I put this frosting on vanilla cupcakes which I really didn't need as I was too busy eating the left over frosting from the bowl.  The ONLY complaint is that I couldn't get strawberries in Alaska in October to dip in it!!

YUM!  This is delish!  I used reduced fat cream cheese that I had brought to room temperature (and the butter was at room temperature, too) and it turned out so smooth and creamy!  I used them on "Frosted Banana Bars" submitted by Delta and they were sinfully good!   Try this recipe!

Mmmmm. I tried this on the "Best Carrot Cake Ever" recipe (also found on this site.. and it is) and it was WONDERFUL! This would also make and excellent (but rich) dip for a sliced fruit tray. I would try it as a filling in a pumpkin roll too... soooo good!

I don't know if I'll be making this again, because this recipe is TOOOO GOOD! I had made a double batch to make sure I had enough, and it turned out that I didn't have to as this recipe should be enough to cover your average cake. Anyway, I had tons left over, and it kept calling my name from the fridge, my kids kept finding me sneaking spoonfuls of it! It is THAT good, and I am not one of those people who love frosting, and ask for the corner piece of cake. In fact, I usually scrape most the frosting off my cake before I eat it. But not this! It is so yummy! I actually added a little more powdered sugar to mine to make it a little sweeter. If you like cream cheese frosting, try this. You'll love it!

With so many great reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this one.  It is easy and delicious.  I used it for Lite Carrot Cake found here at All Recipes.  Since I had a 9X13 cake and didn't want a lot of leftover frosting, I made just 1/2 of the recipe.  It was perfect amount and allowed us to be a bit more calorie conscientious.

I thought this frosting was really good!  A little on the sweet side with all the sugar added, but if you don't add the full amount of sugar it will be a bit runny.  I'm not sure how this would fare on a cake if it had to be out of the refrigerator for any length of time.  But, it definitely was delicious on my lemon pudding cake that I made, and my husband really like it.

Perfect! This is one of those standard recipes that just doesn't need improving. I used this to frost a graham cracker cake and it was wonderful. To get it nice and fluffy, beat the cream cheese and butter at a fairly high speed once it's blended together.

Wonderful, creamy, delicious, and easy-to-spread frosting that got raves from all who tasted it.

I increased the powdered sugar by about a cup to give it a little sweeter flavor (doing so didn't make it too thick to spread).  I took part of the frosting, stirred in some lemon juice to taste, and used that as filling for the layers.

Will definitely put this recipe in my "keepers" file!  Thanks, Janni!

I really liked that this frosting was not too sweet.  I used it on a traditional white cake mix for the 4th of July.  I added fruit to the top.  I realized that it also made an excellent fruit dip.  Thanks.

Nice for folks who don't like ultra sweetness. For me, it needed more powdered sugar to get to the sweetest point. But if you need a quick, low-cost ingredient cream cheese frosting, this works.

Absolutely perfect recipe for cream cheese frosting.  No need to make any changes.  It makes quite a bit - easily enough to frost a 2-layer 9 inch round cake and have some left over.

This is the perfect balance of sweet and a bit tangy.

Enjoyed this recipe! Was really concerned about the reviews regarding consistency but it was no issue! I took a few tips from other reviewers. I used "softened" cream cheese ( full fat) and butter (REAL salted butter). Left out for approx 90 mins. Soft but still cool to touch. Whipped butter and vanilla first; then whipped in cream cheese 4oz at a time, just enough to mix. Do not over mix! Added confectioners sugar 2/3 cup at a time. Again did not over mix. Mixture gets thinner with more sugar and over mixing, NOT thicker. My frosting was thick and even had to use quite a bit of force for piping. It does get softer but that was the result of handling of piping bag. Simply popped in fridge for a bit, and ready to star again. Loved that it was not overly sweet!

I made this recipe using granulated sugar mixed with cornstarch (because that's what I had in the pantry and we live 20 minutes from a store). This is absolutely yummy. I also cut the ingredients in half and have plenty of icing for my two loaves of gingerbread cake.

LOVE this recipe!  I'ts so easy, just 4 ingredients, and it whips up light and fluffy, not too sweet.  It's perfect for carrot cake, fruit dip, etc.

Awesome recipe when I made it for the first time. but  Make sure to only use traditional cream cheese and not spreadable cream cheese or it won't thicken at all! The spread ruined the whole frosting :(

I made this and it turned out phenomenal.  I make it exactly like the recipe stated, creaming the butter and cream cheese together first, adding the vanilla and mixing it in.  Then, gradually adding the powdered sugar. Then it tasted spectacular just as it was.  After tasting it I decided it was delicious but I wanted some lemon flavor so I added a few squeezes of lemon.  This is an easy, tangy, not too sweet frosting.  My kitchen was very warm, so let the frosting cool down in the refrigerator to thicken up before I spread it on.

Great recipe! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions regarding the vanilla and also added a little almond extract. I used this on top of "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" recipe found on this site and the combination was perfect. Thank you for the recipe and thank you to the reviewers!

I made this today but added an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar because I didn't think it was sweet enough & it is I think one of the best cream cheese frostings I've had in a long time. I put it on my Banana Cake recipe instead of the usual Baker's Frosting bc I didn't have time to cook the Baker's base.  honestly don't know which is better. I need to make another cake & put Baker's Frosting on it to compare...lol

Absolutely delicious and perfectly balanced. Not too tangy, not too sweet. I followed directions exactly except for doubling vanilla to 2 tsp and it came out unbelievably silky smooth. It is definitely not a "frosting" when made as directed as it is not stiff but was perfect on my carrot cake i made in 9x13 pan with left over icing which i just ate with a spoon lol

okay followed this exactly. I was delish freshly made. very cheesy not overly sweet and had a great whipped texture. I made pumpkin bars and this made way too much frosting for a 9x13. it spread great but after it being in the fridge, the taste of the frosting changes and gets very thick. my kids didnt even like it. it also had a hard time sticking to the bars when being cut, kinda came off of them and is just too thick. gave 3 stars for my use of it however it may work better for a different type of dessert.

I used this with the Pumpkin Cake III recipe from this site for my daughter’s 13th birthday cake. Only changes to both were using almond extract instead of vanilla, because my children used all the vanilla and didn’t tell me before shopping. Kids! Oh, and I halved the recipe based on so many reviews of having extra frosting. I had enough to make my Bundt cake look great, still with leftover frosting. Both recipes were AMAZING!

Real cream cheese frosting, nothing like the can stuff at the grocery store. I found that after the cake (that was frosted) was in the fridge for a bit, the frosting was much more enjoyable. I used room tempature butter and colder cream cheese . If you like a very sweet frosting, this one probably isn’t for you. Taste like the frosting from the bakeries.

I have made this icing at least a dozen times.  It is so delicious, so cream cheesy and not too sweet. It is perfection if you like to actually taste cream cheese in your cream cheese frosting. It has saddened me for years that the first review talks about this being runny and like a glaze, that couldn't be further from the truth; there was absolutely operator error. I will never change recipes for this.

Outstanding. Perhaps some struggled with consistency due to brands of ingredients they used? I used Philadelphia brand cream cheese and Land O'Lakes butter and Penzey's vanilla. Store brand confectioner's sugar. Turned out perfect. Frosted 16 carrot cupcakes with left over frosting. Probably can frost 20-24 cupcakes. I piped the frosting with a Wilton kit.

Made it first time on red velvet. I think some people have over softened the cream cheese and butter. My consistency was good. I am making again today, will update review if results are different.

It has a great cream cheese flavour but it is too thin, it is pouring out of my two layer cake, unable to thicken it and its making a mess of my cake unfortunately.

I've made this recipe numerous times for cupcakes and pumpkin cake and absolutely love it! I am not a huge cream cheese frosting lover, but this one is to die for! It definitely has more of a cream cheese flavour than other recipes. Highly recommended!

Wonderful cream cheese frosting, great for beginners who want something classic, simple, and hearty. 

There's really nothing to change about this recipe unless you want to get creative with it, but there's no reason to! It's just that wonderful.

I don't know how much this makes in regards to cake-coverage, we made two six-inch cakes and there's far more than we need.

I did not make any significant changes to the makeup of the recipe. 
I did follow the instructions of another user that recommended to blend the butter fully with the powdered sugar prior to adding the cold cream cheese. I have made this recipe in the past and it was quite runny (though delicious), this time I did as was recommended and it turned out perfectly. I was able to frost my cake immediately. One reason I thought this might be the case is that cream cheese typically has a stabilizer in it, and high-shear mixing (like what you're doing in a food processorg) can break down stabilizers and make whatever you're making very runny. But that technique was perfect!!

Very good frosting with 1 change. I only used half the cream cheese and it was very good. Not too sweet and very creamy. It was very good on carrot cake.

I found Sam’s Famous Carrot Cake which I made a few changes while putting it together.  I left my review for the cake.  Someone who also baked that cake recommended this icing.  I made a few changes because my hubby loves double, sweet icing.  I doubled everything except the butter and cream cheese to make it sweeter for him.  Putting these two together with the changes for the sweet, double icing produced an amazing cake!  We had to try it immediately after it cooled.  Can’t wait to try it tomorrow as some folks say it’s even better after a day in the fridge!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  Yummy!

I will NEVER purchase cream cheese frosting again!! It was so good right out of the bowl,  it was difficult waiting to frost the cake!  This would make an awesome fruit dip!!  I love it and this is a permanent part of my recipe box!!

This is a great frosting with a few modifications. First, I doubled the sugar. That much cream cheese and butter makes it a little too runny. However, after adding the sugar, I also added about a tablespoonof pineapple juice for flavor and a half teaspoon of lemon juice to reduce the stress a bit.

Perfect on Best Carrot Cake Ever.  Was able to frost a two layer 9x13 carrot cake albeit not very thick frosting.  Sorry I accidentally loaded the pic twice...love is sweet!  Not the least bit runny...but I didn’t sift the powdered sugar, so maybe that’s why.

Halved the recipe but used 2 cups sugar & 1.5 tsp of vanilla. Still tasted cheesy but was delicious. Would consider making again.

Edited to add that after a few days this is AMAZING!!

Good recipe although I did add one extra cup of powdered sugar. It wasn't quite sweet enough for me as written. However, I do like the fact that it wasn't overly sweet as many frosting recipes tend to be. Taste it and go from there. People like different levels of sweetness to there frosting. It made enough to completely frost and fill a three layer cake. A keeper.

I love this frosting . I think the next time I make it[ & yes I will be making it again] I will use just a little less butter. Other than that this is the perfect frosting for my made from scratch spice & carrot cakes.

I followed PABBYDOG's  advice, using 1 8oz. package of cream cheese (reduced fat) and used a 1/4c. of butter, 2c. powdered sugar, and 1 1/2tsp. of vanilla. It is very good.

I give this recipe 0 stars Because I was tremendously disappointed with this recipe. The cake was too moist. I even put it back in the oven. Only top cooked. Below that, the whole thing was like not cooked. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!
I only gave it 1 because I had to rate it. It wouldn't no let me submit it if I didn't.

It came out very runny for me and I had to add a lot more powdered sugar. The flavor is really nice and I would make it again with the added cup of sugar.

A very decadent cream cheese frosting, I cut the sugar down to about a quarter cup and added 2 T. of lemon zest. I used a batch on Sam's carrot cake and it was perfection. Keep in mind that the more confectioners sugar you add, the thinner your frosting will become.

Cream cheese frosting is one of those things that everyone likes a certain way. I like enough sweet so that it doesn’t taste like pure cheese cake. Given my preferences, I used this version of this frosting: 16 oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of sifted powered sugar, 1/3 cup softened butter, and split the vanilla extract in half to add a half teaspoon of almond extract. It was fluffy, not runny at all, with a little tang, but not so much that it clenched your jaw! Great, soft consistency and balanced flavor.

With added extra sugar (as per the reviews), this was very good. Extremely thick, but tasty. Next time I will try adding some orange zest.

The best cream cheese frosting.  Not too sweet and spreads very easily.  Family favorite.

This is a true cream cheese frosting! I added an extra 1/2 cup sugar, although I don't believe this was necessary. The comments that suggest adding more sugar are looking for more of a sugar frosting than a cream cheese one.

I represent the reviewers that did slight changes to test for flexibility and personalized taste.  I wanted cream cheese flavor but buttercream to shine through too.  I did about 4oz of cream cheese and kept the rest of recipe the same; and it tastes good.  Oh, and I added 2T of milk (b/c I thought the recipe called for it; I've been studying several recipes at once, oops!).  It worked out well.  I think you can really play with these flavors and tweak it to your liking.

I followed the recipe exactly,  and it came out fantastic. Iced and filled a 2 layer 8 inch chocolate cake for a birthday. Beautiful consistency. I don't see how others had problems with it being runny, unless their butter and cheese were almost melted. Will make again.

Didn’t change a thing and it is deeeeeeeeelicious! Tangy and sweet without being tooth hurting sweet. I even set aside a small portion and added cocoa like the recipe recommends and that is so good too! I didn’t have any problems with it being runny, it spread quite easily over the pumpkin spice cake I made. I’ll be saving this recipe for future use!

Every time I make this recipe, I’m reminded why I don’t plan on ever buying store bought frosting again. The recipe as listed makes a lot of frosting, like it could frost two 9x13 cakes! One tip I would give is to refrigerate the cake after you frost it to help set it because the frosting is delicious but a little “gloppy”

By far my favorite cream cheese recipe...and I’ve tried a few. It’s tangy and not overly sweet. Amazing with the carrot cake I made. About to pair it with a red velvet cake and I know it won’t disappoint. Oh! And I used it under fondant and it held its own with no issues.

Made it once for a request from family.
Was such a hit that they asked me if I wanted to go to culinary school.
A few months later, guess what I did.
Enroll in my local colleges baking program.
The cake was delicious, even to those who dislike carrot cake.

I followed this recipe to the T! Not sure what went wrong but it completely flopped.. Way too moist and did not have a cake texture. Took a lot of effort and time and in the end I was very disappointed.

This recipe required no changes whatsoever. It was absolutely delicious! I love that it tastes like actual cream cheese. 
Before I frosted my cake, I let this get cold for over an hour. It worked perfectly this way.

Absolutely first rate cream cheese frosting.  Just the right thickness in consistency.  This is the quality cream cheese frosting that you would be served at a fine restaurant.  Easily accommodates a 9" x 13" sheet cake.

Simple and tasty! Only one change.  Instead of 2 1/2 cups of sugar for 24 cupcakes, I put in 1 1/2 cups. Slightly sweet but still a great cream cheese taste to it. I don't like my cream cheese frosting too sweet.

This is a fabulous frosting. Perfection. Recently I also added 1 tsp of lemon rind and 1.5 tbsp of lemon juice for a citrus flavor to frost a carrot cake. Divine.

Great taste but there must be something wrong. I put in two blocks of cream cheese -I put in one stick (which is half a cup) of butter -I put in a teaspoon of vanilla and I put in 2 cups of powdered sugar and this still ran all over the cake and flooded down onto the cake stand. Of course I know that these are stored in the refrigerator bit before I could even get it in the refrigerator the icing was all over the place. And I had even added an extra cup of powdered sugar because the icing looked very thin to me when I was  following the directions. Any ideas on what I could’ve done wrong? I’ve been making carrot cakes with cream cheese icing for years and never had this problem

Great pointers for this recipe and to flavor it! First blend the cream cheese by itself until creamy. Next add your flavoring/extract.  (I made lemon flavored and ended up using almost half a jar of the extract.). You will want to make the flavor a little bit stronger than what you want. It will tame down when you add the other ingredients. Next mix in your vanilla. Then mix in the butter. You will need to sift the sugar before you measure it. If you don’t you’re going to be putting in more sugar and it will be lumpy.  Pour in the sugar half cup at a time, mix thoroughly and keep adding sugar until it gets to the sweetness you desire. If for some reason it starts to get runny you can use powdered buttermilk to help thicken it back up.  If you blend the cream cheese by it self first you shouldn’t have that issue.  I did not cut the recipe, but I did add a smidge more vanilla. I made a layered 9 x 13 cake - there was plenty of frosting to cover it.

Had to thicken it up. This is not a real cream cheese frosting, more of a cinnamon roll icing.  Too sour to be on cake.

I made this recipe as it was written. I covered a 9X13 sheet cake with a thick coating and have a small amount left for whatever.  I enjoy a sweet frosting on my cake and even better with ice cream.  Easy to make and what you’re looking for.

I made this frosting for a triple decker (9 inch pans) carrot cake. It was just enough frosting to separate into 3 colors and cover the entire cake (including between the layers. It was absolutely delicious... but you’d expect that when the ingredients are just fat and sugar ;)

Perfect, eat right out of the bowl goodness!  Don't change a thing.  Make sure you whip it with a mixer on high at each step, and you will get the perfect fluffy consistency.

This frosting was very good but is not that sweet, so as a lot of the reviews before had said, adding an extra cup of powdered sugar helps a lot with the sweetness and it is great!!!

I always add a pinch of coarse salt, and this is the only cream cheese recipe I use. Not overly sweet like so many.  I sent in a cake for my son to school, he came home and told me the teacher's wanted the recipe, said it was the best they'd ever had. HIghly recommended!

I must admit to eating this with a spoon, it was so good! I made this to the recipe and thought it didn't need any additional sugar - you're supposed to taste the cream cheese flavor! I did have to make 1 1/2 batches to cover a 9" layer cake including a generous layer in the middle. Perfect on carrot cake

I made this exactly as written, and it was exactly what I was wanting.  I made a sweet potato cake that a local restaurant serves and my husband wanted a cream cheese frosting.  This was perfect - not too sweet, and paired wonderfully with the cake.  I didn't have any problems with the consistency, but did let it sit while the cakes cooled.  Will definitely use again!

This frosting is very good. I made half the recipe and it came out perfect. Follow the suggestion of using the butter and cream cheese at room temperature. Your results will definitely depend on it. Also, it is not extremely sweet. It is for people who want to really feel the tangy flavor of the cream cheese without the overpowering sugar flavor. I recommend this for covering a cake it has the perfect texture for spreading.

Perfect!  The easiest and most amazing cream cheese frosting I've ever made.  Did it exactly as specified although the butter might not have been as soft as prescribed (due to my lack of patience).  I didn't have to do anything to alter it.

This is as easy as it gets... no more store bought frosting! I think this can be fluffed with whipped creme or add peanut butter and/or chocolate to mix it up, but this is perfect as is or flavored depending on the  pastry you are making. Thank you for this recipe!

This is my favorite frosting recipe. it is my default go-to frosting for any cake flavor. The best is pairing this with a chocolate cake. Depending who I am cooking for I change the amount of sugarvadded. Kids tend to want all the sugar, but adults usually prefer less sweet.

I halved the recipe, but kept the sugar the same & omitted the vanilla extract (sometimes it’ll taste too alcohol-y and I’d hate to ruin a frosting). Delicious recipe. I think next time I’ll add the right amount of sugar, though.

Some of the reviews for this make no sense.  In particular, some of them say that the icing is too runny, which makes no sense because the only liquid is a teaspoon of vanilla.  It had a nice texture and nice cream cheese flavour.

Fantastic! It's true: this recipe is not too sweet, and if you really want the taste of cream cheese rather than sugar to come out in the frosting, this recipe will work for you. I halved it for a smaller carrot cake and used whipped cream cheese rather than regular, and I used a splash more vanilla since I like the flavor. It was perfect. Since I mixed by hand, I had to really take time and whip the ingredients to get rid of the  sugar lumps, but the results were awesome. On my second go around, I might try adding orange zest to the recipe for a change up. I highly recommend this recipe. It came out like a frosting, not an icing, in my opinion. If you want a sweeter, less piquant cream cheese frosting, look elsewhere.

Perfect!  I made a half batch and it came out perfect. Not too sweet, very creamy and just the right consistency. This has just become my go to icing recipe.

This is what cream cheese frosting should taste like.  If you want a super sweet buttercream frosting, then make a buttercream frosting.  This is perfectly tangy.

I made this cake the morning of the event wanting it as fresh as possible but to my surprise, the left overs were even better the next day. Very moist! So from now on I will make it the day before which is easier in me. I made a cream cheese frosting from this site and put lemon pie filling in the layers. It was awesome! Big hit! I will use this recipe from now on. Very easy great cake!

I liked it, but I only used 8oz. of cream cheese and 1/4 cup of butter and added more powdered sugar for a total of 3 1/4 cups. I thought it wasn't  sweet enough for me. LOL  I also used a half tsp. more of vanilla and I had to add 2 tablespoons of milk because I couldn't get the cream cheese off the beaters.

Quick and easy cream cheese frosting!  I cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 pkg of cream cheese and it was perfect consistency.  I used it for topping brownies and my son nearly had a heart attack when he took his first bite.  Needless to say he liked it. ;0)

It can put a little lumpy but that was my fault. I should have softened it longer than I did. I made it to teach kids how to decorate a cake. It was marvelous and simple.  It didn’t separate either. Will use again. It does need one more cup of powdered sugar. It was sweet enough after that.

Whoa! In your face cream cheese! I prefer a more subtle cream cheese flavor. Not a fan. Perhaps one cream cheese would have been better.

I accidentally hit “done” before finishing my review. Best frosting I’ve ever had! I used one 8oz box of cream cheese and one 8oz box of neufetal (sp?) though because that’s what I had. I was sure to put a really thick layer of my new favorite frosting on my carrot cake. The frosting really made the cake. Thank you!

After reading reviews that said this recipe could be a little runny, we skipped softening the butter and cream cheese substitute and started with them at room temperature instead.

We first sifted the 2 cups of powdered sugar and then slowly blended the other ingredients into it using a hand mixer set on low, first the vanilla, then the butter (we used sheep butter at room temperature, not softened).

We substituted 8 ounces of Tofuti Better Than Cream Cheese for the Cream Cheese. After we added  one package of Tofuti, again at room temperature not softened, and had a nice consistency, we tasted the frosting. Tofuti has a different taste than cream cheese and can be overpowering. We liked the consistency and the taste so we skipped adding more Tofuti (we would have added the second package in batches to avoid getting too solid in structure).

We'll definitely make again.

Very good with the tweaks others recommended - 1/4 c butter, one 8 oz package cream cheese, keep the icing sugar the same.  Generously frosts 1 9x13 inch cake.

I added unsweetened cocoa to this frosting. Like another reviewer stated,  this frosting tasted so much like cream cheese. It probably would have been better with crackers.

I made as instructed and was very good as written.  However, since it was warm in my kitchen, it was too runny.  Room temp must be subjective ;)  Also, this wasn't really sweet enough for my taste.  So, one extra cup of xxx sugar solved both problems.  I will make this again and again with the extra sugar.

No changes made - it's perfect as-is.  It is smooth and creamy because of having more butter and less confectioner's sugar than the usual cream cheese frosting recipe.

If you're looking for cream cheese icing that's not too sweet this is a great choice. I cut recipe in half for a 9x13 cake because we don't love a lot of icing. I felt it was enough to satisfy everyone. Will make again

I followed exactly and it was delicious. I didn't find it to thin at all. It was perfect for the oatmeal cookie pies I made.

Super easy to make and it's delicious! I put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes or so after I mar it and it was the perfect spreading consistency! Will def make again!

It's a good, basic cream cheese frosting recipe, great place to start and then make it your own, needs a lil' some-some in my opinion. First time was fine, had it on amazing zucchini bread my husband had made, but second time I added a little cinnamon, added brown sugar, and cut a tablespoon of butter from it, after personalization it's a 5 star, imo

This is a lovely cream cheese frosting, not overly sweet and goes well with heavily spiced cakes. The only thing I changed was I added 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, which gave it a more frosting like consistency.

Just what I was looking for. As always, add confectioners Sugar slowly, until you reach the consistency and flavor balance you want. Measuring confectioners Sugar is as imprecise as measuring flour, so you must always be willing to adjust the amount.

I used 9 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, some vanilla and zest of half a lemon. I used half of it for a zucchini bread. I wonder if  I can keep the other half  it in the freezer for later use.

It does not get any easier than this....Excellent recipe! If you like it sweeter, just add more powdered sugar to your taste.  This is a smooth, delicous frosting that will be good on pound cake or carrot cake.

Not sure about this one; I did use too much butter and not enough cream cheese so had too much of a butter taste. I may try again another time.

I halved this recipe, and made it with Greek yogurt cream cheese (claims 4x the protein and 1/2 the fat of regular cream cheese), and added about a tsp of cardamom. Best frosting I have ever made... ever tasted!!

My first time making icing, and it turned out great. Didn't add as much vanilla as it said, not a fan, but it still turned out better than i hoped. I will definitely recommend this recipe. :D

Made 1/2 the recipe -- used 8oz softened cream cheese, 1/4 stick of salted softened butter, 3/4 cup of confection sugar -- sifting 1/3 cup at a time, 1 full teaspoon of vanilla -- excellent!! Makes enough for a 8x8 small cake.  NOTE -- make sure to leave butter and cream cheese on counter for at least 2 or more hours to soften.

It had too much of a cream cheese taste so I added a cup more of confectioner's sugar and another dash of vanilla. Consistency was great.

When I tasted this delicious, cream cheesy, whipped concoction I heard the Hallelujah chorus!!!!  Delicious and light with just the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't measure everything exactly, but used the proportions as directed.  Pure perfection in my book.  My family thought the same thing!!!  Totally beautiful, slightly shiny, light nectar of the gods!

I followed the recipe as is and it is absolutely the best cream cheese icing! My husband loves it and is always asking me to make it. I make cupcakes and pipe the icing into them which is his favorite and my grandson loves it  between my chocolate chip cookies. This is a winner!

Been making this recipe for years. I make it just as the recipe says. It is a little thin after you add all the sugar. The trick is to let it stiffen up in the fridge. I usually make mine a day ahead of time and it comes out great. I uses it on its own or under fondant. And keep the cake in the fridge until close to serving time. The flavor is always a big hit!

I made this recipe many times and followed it exactly.  I have had no issues with it's consistency and flavor.  I want a sweetened cream cheese frosting to cover a cake and not an over sweet blob that simply puts sugar in my mouth.  Love it and will continue to make it.

Amazing frosting - Do NOT let your butter & cream cheese soften too much or frosting becomes runny.   I chopped up cold butter and cream cheese, this allowed me to beat them furiously with the mixture and and the frosting did not become runny.   Also, if you sift the powdered sugar it blends much more easily with the frosting, thus you don't have to mix it quite as much so the frosting does't get hot from the friction of the mixer.   I did not have to add more than 2 cups sifted powdered sugar and the frosting was perfect.

For a nice twist, try adding the zest of one lemon (Meyer), it made the frosting even better on my carrot cake....LOVE this recipe!

Exactly what I wanted  in a cream cheese icing.  I just need to beat it until blended.   Tasted wonderful on my carrot cake.

This is very good but did double the amount of powder sugar just to make it stretch farther as I had a big cake to frost.

Beater than any other cream cheese icing I've ever tried. Pipes easily for cakes or cupcakes.

This was veryyyyy loose, sticky, and flavorless. I added at least a whole cup extra of sugar and also had to add a bit of lemon extract to brighten it up. This recipe by itself was not good. It was acceptable after  I added things in. The people that used this recipe, changed it a bunch and then gave it a 5 star rating are misleading everyone. The second you change it, you're no longer using this recipe.

Decadence! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't sift the sugar. I ended up getting some chunks in it and will make sure I do that next time. I tasted it after it was done and decided to add another cup of sugar. It was delicious as is, but the kids will be more pleased with it a little sweeter. This is a recipe worth writing down! Thanks!

This was awesome frosting!!!  So easy and delicious with just the right mix of flavors!  It whipped up super creamy and light with so much flavor.  I just made it for a homemade strawberry cake.  It was the perfect complement to the strawberries.  I will make it again and again!!!

I added 1/2 cup more of confectioners sugar as well as 1 teaspoon of 1/2 and 1/2.  The consistency of the frosting had been too thick and I felt the cream cheese flavor needed to be more balanced with the sugar

This is a delicious frosting, very easy to make, but it is really much too runny for a layer cake. It didn't adhere to the sides of the cake at all and it looks a little sad though I am sure it will taste great.

Sooooo tasty! Flavor was everything I was looking for in a cream cheese frosting. My only slight disappointment was the consistency. It was definitely on the runnier side, so not totally ideal for frosting a cake. But it worked! Going to play around with it next time see how I can thicken it up a bit. Will definitely be using this recipe again though!

I made this for a carrot cake recipe on here (Allrecipes app). It is fantastic!! I followed the ingredients to the letter. I did take the advice of one reviewer and blended the cream cheese and vanilla and simply cut in the butter. This always works better for my sugar cookies too. I had two cups of sifted powder sugar and that's all I had in my home. I was a bit worried as other viewers said they used three cups to get a sweeter taste. For me the ingredients in this recipe is perfect. It has a cheesecake like taste and has just enough sweet to cheese ratio. My husband loves the real cream cheese frosting so I know he will love this!! This will stay in my favorites!! :)

Absolutely wonderful!  I only had 12 oz. of cream cheese, so I reduced the amount of powdered sugar accordingly.  It tasted delicious - creamy and not too sweet, with just the right amount of cream cheese flavor. It was the perfect frosting for a 9 inch round, 2-layer carrot cake.

I love this cream cheese frosting!  Simple and quick to whip up.  I added about 1/4 c less sugar.  I think this frosting is wonderful because I am not a big fan of sweet frostings - this is creamy and decadent, like cheesecake :).  Mmmm....  I'm putting it on strawberry oatmeal bars.

This is a delicious cream cheese frosting...made it exactly by the recipe except that I added an additional tsp. of vanilla extract.  This is a pretty versatile frosting.   For the reviewers that say it is not sweet enough, simply add more powdered sugar.   This is the kind of frosting that tastes like cheesecake!  Going in with my permanent recipes!  Love!  Thanks!

I made it and it turned out great. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar in fear of making it runny. Came out very good. A real cream cheese frosting. Just what I was looking for. NOTE: for the people that are giving a bad review to this recipe: your lack of skill does not mean you give a bad review. Put less sugar if you do not want it to run. 1 1/2 cup is perfect. Not very sweet but  thick. Perfect. Thank you for the recipe. Eddie, Norwood MA

It was beautiful.  I make it all the time.   Now though I half the sugar to go perfectly I with a real sweet sticky cake.  Then the zing from the frosting really balances it out.  Thank you it is a really lovely recipe

Great flavor but I doubled the vanilla and initially only used 1.5 cups of powdered sugar.  I only had low fat cream cheese and noticed that the frosting started to separate and was runny so I had to whip in another cup of powdered sugar.  That helped but it still was not as thick as I would have hoped. Will try again with full fat CC and rate again.

This was super yummy! I made it for red velvet cupcakes but it was to light and didn't sit well I still have it a five because the description never listed cupcakes as a use. It is super light and airy not too sweet just right . I will definitely put it on my pineapple cake fresh from the bowl it was too light for my cupcakes. It was too loose but I refrigerated the frosting over night and then piped it on and it was perfect and still tasted light and airy

It was pretty clumpy so make sure you sift the sugar twice. It only converted 24 cupcakes

Yummy!!  Perfect for any kind of bars, cakes, cinn rolls, etc!  If you want it thicker or thinner, you can adjust the powdered sugar amount accordingly.

I made this for my dad, who doesn't care for "too sweet". This was perfect! The cream cheese really came through, but it was still sweet enough for a cake. The only thing I had a problem with is that it is very thick. I had a hard time spreading it on my cake without tearing the cake, but I managed by putting dollops here and there and spreading over much smaller areas. Dad hasn't tried it yet, but I think he will love it, too!

This icing was needed for a carrot cake mix for my youngest grandson's birthday. It was done with no changes to the recipe at all and was used on a 13X9 cake. It provided a .5 to .75" layer, nice and thick. The test came with his younger sister who hates carrot cake but loves icing. She hated this icing too... perfect!

Halved it. (Didn't need much). Starts out a little runny but a few minutes in the fridge firms it up. Great topping or filling!

I made this frosting and it tasted really good. It was really sweet, maybe a little too sweet. I made the following changes:

1. 1-8oz. Cream Cheese
2. 1/2 c up Melted Butter

Side note: I used this recipe when I made a banana cake. I kept some of the mashed banana aside from the cake recipe and added it to this frosting recipe. YUM!!

Love this icing. I do following the prior recommendation to cut the amount on cream cheese in half and I add a little extra vanilla extract. Depending on the cake and sweetness level I want I sometimes add a little more powdered sugar to taste.

I made it just like directed and it came out perfectly.  To the person that it turned out watery there is no way you could have followed directions precisely. The only liquid it has is the vanilla. 1 tsp will not make it watery. Did you accidentally add too much? Or melt the butter? It's best to use measuring spoons and cups to make sure a recipe turns out.

Fantastic recipe. I used it to top an applesauce sheet cake (11 x 17). The quantity and consistency was perfect. I did refrigerate the cake after frosting to let the frosting set up and make it easier to cover with wrap after cutting. The flavor is not too sweet which was perfect for my cake. The only thing I added was a pinch of allspice and that was more for looks than flavor. The little specks added a nice touch.

DELICIOUS! It had an amazing texture, and held the dye I used absolutely beautifully. I did, however, add about a half cup more sugar and a little extra vanilla extract to my taste.

Measurements are way off for a frosting, by the end I more than doubled the sugar to get it to thicken up but it was still loose!  As written it was far too cream cheesy for our taste.  IF I were to use this recipe again I would use half the cream cheese and butter.  Not sure how anyone made it work as written.

I sort-of liked it. It was a good frosting, but tasted more cheesy from the cream cheese than creamy and sweet. But, it was really good other than that. The recipe I made with my cake was okay. It wasn't this recipe, it was the cake. I actually found a chocolate cake recipe on here, but it turned out hard to chew, and bulky(I mean, not all the flavors incorporated together very well.) 

       But overall, it was a pretty good recipe. Next time, I think I'll use 1 package of cream cheese, like other members have suggested.

I loved it.. although I did use the suggestion of others and used only one block of cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of butter. Used this for a store bought deluxe carrot cake!!

So it tasted good... But I modified it and still didn't like the consistency ... I used only 1 package of cream cheese and tried to thicken it with more than 2 cups of powdered sugar.... The taste is amazing, but it goo-ed out of the side on my 2 layer cake.

My go to cream cheese frosting.  Not too sweet and really has a cheesecake flavor.  Love it!  If you like things super sweet this is not for you.

So much better tasting than the bought stuff. And SUPER easy to make!! I'm not the biggest fan of cream cheese so I only used 1 brick of cream cheese & half stick of butter. Was very easy to spread. Make sure to let you cream cheese & butter be at room temperature!

Good, classic frosting. I personally don't like overly sweet things so I used only one cup of sugar. It was perfect in consistency and flavor for the carrot cake I put it on.

This is for cream cheese frosting lovers!! This is not your super-sweet cream cheese frosting found in the cans, but a tasty "just right" blend. I did make a half of the recipe for a 13x9" sheet cake and heaped the cup of powdered sugar, which was just perfect! This is highly recommended for a carrot or red velvet cake! Ill be using this as my "go to" recipe from now on!

The consistency and creaminess is superb. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was not quite sweet enough for my carrot cake. It tasted more to the sweetness of cheese cake than icing. I added confectioners sugar to taste; approx. 3.5 - 4 cups overall.  I also want to add that I used unsalted butter, so that was not the issue with sweetness.
**One helpful tip to anyone making icing for the 1st time, DO NOT melt your butter. This is why icing comes out runny. Let your butter and cream cheese get to room temperature, cream the two together, then mix in the confectioners sugar, then vanilla.

Delicious frosting with a MODIFICATION. We made this frosting with 1/2 of the powdered sugar, and it was very good. Next time we might cut the sugar down a bit more to 3/4 cup instead of the 1 cup we used, or the 2 cups the recipe asked for.

Just made this tonight...sweetie raved and raved.  I left out raisins, added a t. Vanilla, a t. Almond, about a t. Lemon peel (dried), 1 teaspoon each of allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I used 3 c shredded carrots and I chopped walnuts and added at the end of mixing.  My flours were 1 c. Spelt flour and 1 c. Almond flour and added the rest of what the recipe called for.  I put it in an oblong pampered chef casserole (13 X ?) and cooked about 50 minutes.  Perfect.  I topped it, when a bit cooler with Cream Cheese 11 icing on this site.  I only made half the frosting recipe as that was exactly perfect for the cake shape used.  Next time I'm using applesauce in place of the oil.  I've done that with a few other dishes in the past and it was absolutely great!  Do this, people...OMG.

Excellent Cream Cheese frosting.  Added 1/3 cup home made carmel sauce to original recipe (didn't have to increase anything to compensate for extra ingred) turned out incredible.  Using it to cover a dark chocolate turtle cake.

I edited it as suggested by another reviewer to cover a 9x13 cake. To top it off, I added some chopped pecans. Yum! Changes used from the other reviewer: 1 - 8oz cream cheese, 1/4C butter, 2C icing sugar, 1.5tsp vanilla.

I wish I had read reviews for this recipe. I didn't, and I didn't like this at all. It was way too cream cheesy! I even added cocoa to make it a chocolate frosting. My son & I scraped it off, my daughter smothered it with Hershey's syrup,  but my hubby and other son ate it even though they didn't care for it too much.  I might give it another chance following the other reviewers suggestions about using only one package of cream cheese. Not sure though. This was really bad.

Very runny. I don't want to decorate my cakes/cupcakes with it. Probably would have worked with one package of cream cheese and less butter like PABBYDOG suggested. Wish I would've read the reviews first but was too busy this go round. :/

This is good. Not to sweet. We dont like overly sweet stuff. Its just a hint of sweetness. Only thing i changed was the amount of powdered sugar i used. I used 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. After i made it i put it in the fridge for maybe 20 min to firm it up a bit.

As others recommended, I added approximately 1 tsp of lemon juice and the zest from about 3/4 of a lemon.  It was very soft when I made it, so I refrigerated it for a few hours.  When I took it out, it was a bit too stiff, but within 30 minutes was perfect to use.

I have made this recipe for a few years now and have made it many times. I do not change a thing and it is always a hit!
If you get the cream cheese and butter too soft or your house is warm, you can place the frosting mixture into the freezer for 10 minutes before icing. Very good recipe!

I made this to go with a banana cake. I halved the recipe. I used the blender to make my own confectioners sugar it was good.

I added an additional cup of icing sugar and the flavour was what I was looking for . It just isn't a frosting, especially not for a cake.  I would consider it more of an icing even after adding the additional cup of sugar.

I made this frosting exactly like recipe. It was thick creamy buttery and perfectly sweet.  I did use Philadelphia cream cheese as one of the other reviewers advised. The recipe allowed me to perfectly frost a 2 layer 9" round cake. For me, this will be a staple cream cheese frosting.

I'm a former cake decorator so I needed to make adjustments to this recipe as well. I used 8 oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. It worked well enough. The taste was superb. Unfortunately I live in Louisiana, heat & humidity forced me to keep refrigerating the icing while I worked with it!

Delicious! Added 1 extra tsp of vanilla and used 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 2 and it had the perfect sweetness.  This will be my go-to recipe for cream cheese frosting from now on.

I made this with about 7 oz. Of cream cheese and 1/4 of softened coconut oil because I was out of butter... then I added 3/4 c. Cool whip.  It spread nicely and covered a stacked 9" cake middle, sides and top.

Made as described.  Halved recipe and to one half I added 1/3 cacao powder and a generous dash of extra sugar.    These two halves generously decorated 24 cupcakes.    Rave reviews!

This has awesome cream cheese flavor, but in order to give this true frosting consistency you will need to slightly alter it, so I can only give 3 stars as written.  I add an additional cup (or even a little more, depending on the humidity) of sifted confectioners sugar. I find the frosting has a much better consistency and it is the ideal sweetness without being nauseatingly sweet like many frostings are.  Additionally, I like to add 1/8-1/4 tsp of salt as I think it heightens the flavor of the cream cheese and provides necessary balance, especially if you're serving this on chocolate cake.

I was actually looking for more of a glaze to pour over my Bundt  cake and I used this as a base.  I used only 1 cream cheese, no butter, and sugar was half confection and half white and 1 cup of milk to loosen the mixture.  It worked for me!

I was looking for a cream cheese frosting with a strong cheese flavor. This is it. However, I did add one more cup (3cups) of powdered sugar to firm it and thicken it up a little and really love the result.

Perfect! Not sugary-sweet like some recipes. This recipe is a smooth, cream cheesey, perfectly sweetened delight. I always use salted butter (melted in the microwave), then whip everything in my KitchenAid until fluffy. Put the frosting in the fridge for a couple hours so it gets a little firmer before using it. This recipe cut in half frosts the top of a 9x13 cake nicely.

Very simple to make and just right for my carrot cake! It was plenty sweet. Was able to get it going with a fork and a bit of turning while watching tv. As the picture shows, it wasn't too frosty looking, but my ugly cake was good. 

I changed the ratios to:
5/8 cup Cream Cheese
3 Tbsp. Butter
1 Cup Confectioners Sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract.
This was enough to fully cover  the top and sides of the cake baked in a 9" Bundt pan

I half the recipe. Easy to follow and it's extremely delicious. I used it as frosting for my chocolate cupcakes. It's not runny like some reviews. I make sure both butter and cream cheese are at room temperature before starting.

Amazing recipe! Not overly sweet like others I have tried. I only made half the recipe for one dozen carrot cupcakes, and still had some left over.  A bit too cheesy for my taste, so I added another generous pinch of sugar, and it was the perfect balance! I didn't experience the runny consistency like others have mentioned, it stayed on the cupcakes well. Will make again in the future.

Perfect - I only made a 1/2 recipe and added a tablespoon of whipping cream and 1/4 cup more icing sugar!

I only made a half portion since I was down to a cup of powdered sugar, but it was da bomb & just enough to cover my lemon cake. Totally happy I didn't have to use the fake tub of nasty corn syrup ...

I made it with 2 (8oz) packages of cream cheese. It wasn't the best cream cheese frosting I've had. I will use one package next time.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit!!  I have made it as is and cut it in half .  I always let the cream cheese and butter soften to room temperature and I have sifted the sugar and not sifted.  It  really  hasn't made a difference but that may be due to my Kitchen aide.

Followed recipe exactly and came out great!   If you are using a piping bag, I recommend decorating right after mixing while the frosting is still soft.  Yum!

Made this for Cinnabon type cinnamon rolls. Halved the crevice except for the sugar. Turned out perfect and was the right amount for eight large rolls with a little extra for dipping!

I reduced the amount of sugar a little bit, because I don't like when the frosting's too sweet. But otherwise it was exactly the taste I was looking for :)

This is a great base recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting. However, Diabetes runs in my family so I am used to having a lot less sugar in my food and I prefer my frosting a lot less sweet than this recipe turned out. So, I substituted all the powdered sugar for 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 1/4 cup light brown sugar. OMG it is scrumptious! Also, any left over frosting is positively glorious with sliced fruits especially apples!

I have made this icing several times , once with the butter, the other times with out.  Its as good with out the butter as it is with.
 I prepared the cake the day before and refrigerate it overnight .  Letting the cake sit over night  gives the cream cheese time  absorb all of the flavors. My family loves it. I use the recipe as a guide line, especially the powder sugar.  Depending on your sweet tooth  or lack of sweet tooth, it very easy to regulate.
I'm going to try the chocolate next.

I followed other recommendations and used 3 cups sugar and 2 tsp vanilla extract.  It made a prefect frosting this way.

I made this recipe exactly as shown and it came out perfect! Great flavor, great texture, and it made just the right amount to frost my layer cake (2 9" round cakes with frosting in between, plus top and sides). I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe well over 50 times since I first found it here.  I made no changes and I get nothing but raves when I use this.  I use this to frost most of my cakes and it's a perfect balance and not too sweet, thank you for sharing this !!!!!!!

This icing was amazing, perfect for the cinnamon rolls I made (90 minute cinnamon rolls from this site). Silky smooth and not overly sweet.  It is definitely a softer icing, though, so be aware of you are icing a layer cake or cupcakes...  It wouldn't pipe well unless you put it in the fridge first to harden up.

I followed PABBYDOG's suggeations and made the following changes: 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 2c powdered sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I used it to frost some Ginger Pumpkin Cupcakes from this site, and the combination is spectacular!  Everyone devoured these.  I will make again and again!

This was great! Used it to top a rhubarb cake I made. I followed this recipe exactly as directed and in my opinion, it was neither too sweet nor too cheesy. The only issue: we had it in the fridge for a while (less than an hour) to cool while the cake was baking and it got a little too thick. This was also true once the frosting was on the cake -- it formed a thick layer that sometimes peeled off the cake. The flavor was perfect cream cheese frosting. Just could have stood to have a little extra liquid/creaminess and adhere better to the cake, hence 4 stars instead of 5.

Soooo good! I added a bit of paprika to add some spice and a 1/4 tsp of lemon juice since I was adding it to a bread and not a cake. I also used coconut nector instead of vanilla since I didn't have any vanilla. :-/ But I think this is a great base recipe for a thin frosting.

I added a tsp of lemon extract to enhance the taste and it came out so well. My kids took the extra frosting and had a field day, it was so good. The only thing is you'll have to refrigerate the cake or cup cakes so that the frosting is not as runny.

This is such a smooth, creamy frosting.  I'm licking the bowl, the spoon and the beaters.  I didn't make any changes to it.  It made quite a bit of frosting.  I used it on a red velvet cake.  I can't wait to use it on homemade cinnamon rolls.  Very easy recipe but packed with flavor!

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have made. I looked over the other reviews that said it was runny so what I did was soften the butter but used cold cream cheese. It was stiff enough that I was able to pipe with it. I double the recipe to cover a 10" cake with a layer of frosting in the middle. I used one times the recipe to cover pumpkin bars in a 9x13  pan ( top only not the sides).

I halved the cream cheese, butter and confectioners sugar kept the vanilla as is and it was perfect without being too sweet. I only needed for 12 cupcakes that's why I halved the recipe. Also for a thicker frosting put in fridge for 20 min.
Awesome recipe.

this did not work for me it was runny and would not thicken, after 2 hrs I added another cup of sugar and it was still like pouring icing. I ended up adding another tub of cream cheese and 3 eggs turned it into vanilla cheesecake. that was good. try it if you have any left over.

STUPID GOOD!  I just made this wonderful cream cheese frosting to pipe onto my pumpkin cupcakes for an early thanksgiving gathering. If you make this "as is" I can tell you that it all its supposed to be, Cream cheese frosting!!!  That's it. I wish more people would just make and rate recipes and not change it. If you change it, post your own variation with your own title. As for this little gem. It's perfect!

I have made this frosting and it is VERY yummy....I made 2 different kinds of cup cakes to take to work with me and I added food coloring the the frosting so I knew which flavor was which....I also added  Dr Cherry McGillicuddys Cherry Schnapps and the other flavor I added was Blue UV Vodka...I didn't put in a lot of alcohol just enough to give it some flavor and it was actually really good....had some good compliments about the taste

Yum! this is probably what heaven tastes like. Its an recipe to adjust if you like it more or less sweet, just adjust the sugar. All in all, this is our go-to cream cheese frosting recipe.

I give it 5 stars with the change of adding a 3rd cup of powdered sugar instead of just 2.  But that's just because I prefer a slightly sweeter cream cheese frosting, but was still very tasty before I added the 3rd cup.  I will definitely make this again!

This frosting was sweet, fluffy, and creamy. It was simple to make the frosting because it only had four ingredients. It was a bright white color. I used the frosting on cupcakes but it would be even better on a pumpkin roll.

I did not need a lot so I cut everything in half and it turned out exactly as I imagined; think but light, sweet but not crazy sweet, fluffy and thick. It was the best topping for my pumpkin muffins. I saved it and will use it again! :)

Great recipe, just follow the directions to the T, and make sure the ingredients are room temperature. If you want thicker frosting, you could also use less powdered sugar and make up for it in granulated sugar. Makes a good frosting for carrot cake or seasonal pumpkin cake.

The taste of this frosting was excellent BUT ...  this was quite runny so I added another cup of icing sugar but it was still quite runny.  Loose enough that I couldn't ice the sides of the layered cakes.  
But it tasted great though !!

Instead of 8 Oz of plain cream cheese I used 8 Oz of a tub of pumpkin cream cheese, only change and it was awesome for my pumpkin cake. :-)

Perfect amount of tang for my taste.  Piped a thick layer onto pumpkin spice muffins but ate so much during the process I've been unable to eat a muffin/icing combo yet.  I actually quartered the recipe (6 servings) and did 3 large muffins.

It tasted ok (really it's butter cream cheese and sugar so you can't go far off) but it's way too thin for those who want to pipe it for decoration not just spread it.  I had to add a lot more icing sugar.

I have made decorated cakes for my children, grandchildren, families and friends. No matter what frosting I make, I always have extra powdered sugar on hand.  That way, if I want really stiff frosting all I have to do is add more sugar.  I'm going to try to use Crisco instead of butter next time as it won't be as soft.

I followed the recipe with the changes that PABBYDOG made.   It was the perfect amount of icing for a 9 X 13!  This is now my "go to" recipe.  Not too sweet and not too cheesy.   Just right!  Ty for sharing!

I gave it 5 stars without making any changes. The consistency was exactly what I was looking for and the taste went perfectly with the pumpkin cake I made. I also separated the frosting in half and added pumpkin pie spices to half the recipe for a pumpkin spice flavored frosting. Perfect!

I was one that changed this recipe some. It's a great place to start. I did 3 cups of sugar, 1.5 tsp vanilla, and the zest of a lemon but it was pretty lemony. It was delicious on carrot cake. I'd do the zest of 1/2 a lemon if I didn't want the lemon to stand out too much but still wanted to add some freshness. Without alterations it is still yummy, just tastes like cheesecake.

Such an easy cake to make. I didn't change anything to the cake recipe and it was a moist and dense cake (which I like!) I made the frosting as stated but added about half a can of pineapple w/o juice. It was great. I think next time I will put a whipped cream topping with pineapple. Thanks for the recipe!

This frosting made as is was more buttery than cream cheesey, also not nearly sweet enough.  The consistency was firm enough, but might as well have been spreading butter on the banana cake I made.   I followed another reviewer's suggestions (thanks, Pabbydog) and added more powdered sugar.

Excellent icing, I used granulated sugar instead of powdered and 2 tbs vanilla instead of ts (I love vanilla). I also added a pinch of salt and it was perfect.

I only used one 8 oz packet of cream cheese and the icing tasted amazing. If you use two packets the icing tastes a little too strong, and makes you sick if you eat too much.

Awesome icing. It's very creamy on day one but does start to dry out and become denser by day two or three.

This cream cheese frosting recipe is the most delicious I've ever made.  Light, not too sweet as others I've tried.  This will be my "go-to" recipe from here on in. 10 stars in my book.

I liked how the recipe tasted but I didn't like the consistency of the batter.  It was way to runny.  I used room temperature butter and cream cheese and I wish I hadn't

This is a really good recipe and really easy to make. I added another cup of sugar as suggested by other reviewers and my hubby.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I followed this recipe exactly, only keeping the cream cheese fairly cold and blending the whole thing in my Cuisinart, as I don't have a mixer.  I put it in the fridge while my Carrot Cake XI cooled (recipe from this site).  Not runny at all, maybe that is due to the temperature of cakes they are put on?  I am super happy!!  Thank You!

Made this a few times now with reduced amount of powder sugar. Double everything but powder sugar. And used 1+3/4 cup powder sugar. I succeeded not too sweet, just a touch of sweetness in the frosting like French desserts usually are. So, I can spread on toast with sprinkle of cinnamon, cake mix cakes, sandwich with cookies, spread over waffles, dip for sliced apples, etc. Thank you for this easy tasty creamy  frosting recipe! It sure is in my recipe box!

This frosting is perfect!  Definitely a cream cheese frosting that has the right balance of sweet and tart cream!  I used  RALWATTAR's mixing instructions (beat cream cheese & vanilla first, then slowly add in butter then sugar last.). Came out perfectly!  Paired this with my Pamela's GF red velvet cake. If the cake turns out I'll post my results.

OH, WOW. THIS IS THE BEST FROSTING I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! Seriously. I will use this recipe 4 ever. Although, i love the vanilla flavor, so i always use a little over what this recipe calls for. 
  So, people who are new to this recipe, dont worry if it looks like there is way too much powdered sugar. It will even out in a minute. 

Thank you allrecipes.com!!!

I use this recipe everything I make this icing. I will say my family prefers it to be a little sweeter so I add an extra cup of powdered sugar. As for people saying it too runny, I have never had this problem. I always use Philadelphia Cream cheese and after I get it all creamed together it goes in the refrigerator for a bit and by the time I ready to  frost my cakes it's a perfect consistency. Don't believe any of the negative reviews because it really is a yummy icing.

Not an icing yet more dense and flavorful than a (buttercream) frosting. The secret to getting it light is whip the (softened) cream cheese until light and fluffy, then add (softened, not melted) butter and whip again until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar 1/2 C. at a time and blend thoroughly after each addition to keep it light. I use the same formula as pabbydog which is about half the recipe to cover an 8x12 cake: 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 C. butter and 2C. sifted powdered sugar, with half the vanilla extract. Was superb on a strawberry cake; looking to make a creamsicle cake with this next!

Used it to top a carrot cake- came out perfect. I might increase the recipe by 1.5 next time to have a bit more to work with- had to stretch to cover a 2 layer 8" round cake

Real cream cheese taste. Great if you prefer icing that's not overly sweet. My husband never eats the frosting on cupcakes, he doesn't ahve the sweet tooth I do. But he loved this one. My only complaint was that it was too runny.

This recipe was great! After reading the other reviews, I modified the recipe a bit by lessening the amount of cream cheese and butter, and increasing the amount of vanilla. I also added a bit of strawberry puree to it that gave it a really great strawberry flavor (but made it runny). Overall, this recipe is great! Will definitely be making again.

Fantastic recipe. Super easy with ingredients typically on hand. Used it to cover a lemon cake I made for Easter and it was absolutely delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. I read a few reviews that said this recipe was runny, but I didn't have that experience at all. When I took my whisk out of the bowl, nothing fell off. I would consider this a reasonably stiff recipe, but definitely easy enough to spread. Absolutely perfect.

This is an awesome cream cheese frosting recipe. I've made it twice and each time my family and friends have loved it. I used a 1/2 teaspoon more of vanilla extract and only 1/4 cup of butter. Perfect every time!!

This is fabulous & easy. Cut down cream cheese to 8ozs & butter to 1/4 cup. Used 2 cups sifted powder sugar & 2 teaspoons good vanilla. It's PLENTY sweet -- any sweeter & it would be disgustingly sweet. I am using this to frost a gingerbread cake but it's so versatile I can use it for dozens of other cakes. Thanks for this great recipe.

Wonderful!!! I only had one block of cream cheese, but it worked without the other one. I used it on a chocolate fudge cake. It had just the right amount of tangy sweetness. I won't ever buy frosting again!

I love this recipe!! Normally cream cheese frosting has too much sugar for me, which this recipe didn't. I use granulated sugar instead of powdered, and like it much better.

Super simple and super delicious. I made this as a last minute surprise for hubby who loves spice cake and cream cheese frosting. Waaaayyyyyy better than store bought. It was just a tad tangier than I personally liked so I added about 1/2 cup more of the confectioners sugar. Perfect. Let it sit for a little bit in a cooler room in the house, then piped it onto cupcakes with ease. They taste and look fantastic. Definitely will keep in my arsenal. Thank you!

I've been searching for frosting recipe with less sugar and I found this one. So I tried it with my Christmas cupcake.instead of 1 tsp of vanilla I used food coloring.  So my cupcakes can look like Christmas tree. It tastes yummy

Easy to make and sweetness is just nice . I made half a batch which is good for an 9 inch cake or 24 cupcakes . I topped up the sugar to 1.5 cups for the half batch and used spreadable cream cheese to get a softer consistency. I split half out and added 2 bananas to make banana cream Cheese frosting . My boy was licking his fingers ....

This frosting was very disappointing. It wasn't sweet at all. So I added an additional cup of sugar and more vanilla. This made it palatable but it was still so disappointing. I won't be making this again.

This is the PERFECT recipe for those who don't want a sweet frosting, but more of a cream cheese frosting.  This IS a FROSTING (definition.. thick and fluffy coating of cream or butter, definition of icing.. thin and sugary glaze that hardens).  Everyone who tries this loves it, including kids!!

This recipe, in contrast to others, gives you the tangy cream cheese taste, as opposed to the overly-sweet taste of other some other frosting. Since I was making a double recipe of cupcakes, I decided that, before I doubled the amount of frosting, I should try it first after making the regular amount. Though I enjoyed it, I found it just a bit too tangy, so I added just one more cream cheese package with the rest of the ingredients (making it 3/4 of the amount of cream cheese which the recipe calls for). This change made it almost perfect; it had  a much better balance between tangy and sweet, and it was fantastic on my cupcakes. Because I made this modification, I'm only giving the recipe four stars.

I don't bake often, but this was an easy frosting and turned out perfect for a poppyseed cake. I used one pkg cream cheese and three cups confectioners sugar as suggested by others. I also added a bit more of vanilla -- not much. It turned out delicious and was more than enough for one cake. Might have to bake another cake this week so I can use it up!! Yum! Enjoy!!

Made this frosting for pumpkin bars. It is so good! Creamy and sweet but not overly sweet. Made enough to cover two 13x9 pans of pumpkin bars very well and still had some left over. Very quick and easy as well. Perfect if you are in a hurry, but still want a quality frosting.

Good cream cheese flavor and easy to make.  Did agree that it resembled closer to a glaze, so popped frosting in the freezer for 10 minutes and whipped with mixer.  Consistency fluffy and perfect.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted, lots of cheese flavor, not too sweet.  I will be using this recipe often.  I was only doing the top of the cake so I cut everything in half for that purpose.

I use this recipe as a guide and love it!  I do not measure confectioners sugar, just mix butter and cream cheese, then add the sugar to taste.  I usually pass on vanilla (depending on cake recipe).  I sometimes add a scoop do cool whip for a filler or jello cake.

Used 4ounces less cream cheese and only one cup of icing sugar.....also added  a bit less than a teaspoon of almond extract. Combo with vanilla works well.

This is so easy there is no reason to ever buy the fake tasting store stuff again! I love the slight tart taste. This time making it (I've made it 5-10 times before), I forgot to go in order and frankly didn't see a big difference in the outcome. Will try it again another time soon and compare.

I reduced the sugar - only putting in 65% of what the recipe called for.  It would have been too much for our tastes as is.  By reducing the sugar to this, it came out PERFECT.    Thank you!

Loved it! It was creamy, and fit perfectly with the cake. It did however have a slightly over-powering taste, so i added less cheese

This is my go to recipe for cream cheese frosting. Like other reviewers have stated, it is not a sugary sweet frosting. It is the perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness for me. I recently added the juice and zest from one medium lemon to the mix and it was amazing.

This recipe is good but, sometimes we want it a little sweeter and we use 4 cups of sugar. This also makes the frosting thicker and more sturdy.  Yummy!

Tried it and it was much too sweet. Had to reduce sugar to 1 cup. Otherwise it was good. Also I added 2 tsp fresh lemon juice.

This was really good! Took only about 10-15 minutes to make. I did find that if you are making a serving size of 12, instead of a full cup of sugar, I used a half cup and I was told it was just about perfect. Everything else was perfect!

It was very tasty, the perfect thickness and amount needed to spread over a 6 layer cake! Funny thing is I started with a completely different icing recipe...didnt like the consistency or flavor but was  short on ingredients. Despite needing far less ingredients than the other recipe it far exceeded my expectations!

Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe.  Made exactly as stated and it's wonderful.  Used as frosting for "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" (this site.)  Both are incredible...especially together.

I made the same alterations to recipe that PABBYDOG made. I used 1 8oz cream cheese,1/4 cup butter,1 tsp vanilla and 2 cups powder sugar. It was the perfect partner for my chocolate cake.

As much as I liked this recipe, my family did not... a week later I tried it again with another 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar, and they loved it! Teenagers have quite the sweet tooth! The tang made it the perfect companion for the sweetness of brownies!

Its the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tried! I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to get more of a frosting taste without the plain cream cheese taste that was originally going on. Everyone has tried it and loves it!

This recipe is very tasty. I only used a half recipe for a 9x13 cake and it was plenty. I would recommend refrigerating the cake with frosting before eating, as the frosting just seems better cooler and more solid. We enjoyed it more the second day.

I really enjoyed the strong cream cheese flavor in this one.  It was so much better than the sickly sweet, over the top premade icing that you buy, and it tasted fresh.  I didn't have the issues with runniness that some reviewers talked about, but the icing was not as firm as some others I've made when I was spreading it.  I made it for a Strawberry cake, and will definitely use again.

Added 1.5c powdered sugar just because I wanted it a little less...tart. Helped with the consistency, too only because I was worried about how this frosting would respond in the Texas heat.

Perfect! Just make sure to add the powdered sugar gradually! It makes a difference! I made one batch without doing it gradually, and it was definitely runnier. Regardless, just pop it in the fridge so it firms up before piping. So good!

This frosting is so good I hate putting it on the cake!
I sometimes add things like lemon curd for a lemon twist.  I've also added whipping cream to fluff it up more.  The sky is the limit; great recipe!

I loved this recipe however the frosting unable to hold and melted very quickly in our Singapore humid weather. Any changes could be made to help it hold better?  Like substitute butter with shortening? Btw I added 1 tbsp whipped cream to it as I usually would

I make this frosting regularly and recently had an accidental discovery: Another cook in the kitchen "accidently" sprinkled kosher salt on my frosted cake.  Argggh.  But.. it was awesome!  Try some kosher salt on your cream cheese frosting!

My new "go to" for cream cheese frosting.  I did adapt it slightly for allergy reasons(non-dairy cream cheese and non-dairy margerine substitute) but it worked great on my carrot cake muffins!

It was fluffy and smooth. I've made other recipes before that were nice, but this one was the best. I'm sticking with it. Cream cheese frosting is my absolute favorite. I used this on spice-cupcakes for Easter, and they were a hit!

I love this recipe with the changes that the members have made to it here.  We have no problem using margarine instead of butter and cream cheese that has 1/3 the fat of regular cream cheese and it does not alter the taste.  I recently put this on red velvet cookies and they were excellent!

I've never met a cream cheese frosting I didn't like! This one was the perfect balance of cheese and sugar for me after adding a half cup extra sugar.

BEST - Real. Simple. Perfect recipe of how cream cheese frosting should Really taste. Not at all too sweet. The vanilla really brings it out. I highly recommend it. Do refrigerate this in the back of the fridge if you want to pipe it with an intricate tip. Taking these cupcakes to work! Lord knows they can't stay here!! Lol

I changed this recipe also, because all I had on hand was one package of cream cheese. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and used the 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, two cups of confectioners sugar, but added a splash of vanilla, and about 2 tbsp of cocoa. It has a nice consistency, but the taste wasn't "out of this world" good. It was "last minute, had no other choice, used what I had on hand" good.

This "frosting" is runny and definitely a tangy cream cheese icing, not very sweet at all. The taste of it is fine if a really rich, tangy icing that tastes reminiscent of concentrated plain New York cheesecake.

This is really a good recipe. I've been using this for at least 23yrs. To keep it from being runny, beat the cream cheese straight out the fridge. Let the butter sit out slightly before you blend with cream cheese. Using 1-1/2 bars of cream cheese will give you more of that cream cheese taste that u're looking for and won't be as sweet

I have used this recipe for years. It was NEVER meant to be used to decorate with!!!!  Just to be used as frosting.  I decorate wedding cakes, and would never use this!  The taste is awesome. Have never had a problem with the consistency.  I usually use this for my pumpkin cake, a recipe I got from this web site!   They are great together!!!

I did not like this recipe.  It was so runny that I kept adding more confectioner sugar to make it stiff.  It didn't and the only thing I achieved was a sugar frosting.  Finally I added more cream cheese, but it was so runny.  I did kind of pour it on my carrot cake, but I have made much better cream cheese frosting.

This is amazing!  The best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted.  I loved the fact I could taste so much cream cheese!  I put this on a carrot cake I made for my dad (who doesn't like sweet things in general) and he loved it.

My family loved this frosting when combined with my altered version of the Lemon-Lime Cupcakes recipe I found on this site. I even used an icing bag in order to add a pattern to the frosting on the cupcakes. I've made it two times now and the taste of the frosting comes out perfectly each time. I will try different variations like a raspberry, strawberry, and other flavor combinations later.

The first time I made this it was awesome with no changes to the recipe. Yesterday I made it for the 2nd time and it would not set up. I continued to add powdered sugar and after approx. 6 or 7 cups I quit, still runny. Any ideas? I would give 5 stars for the first time alone.

was looking for a frosting but this was more of a glaze. the vanilla gave it a sour taste and not enough powdered sugar. i was not at all impressed with this recipe. but maybe would make it again with a few tweaks.

I really enjoy the flavor, but I wouldn't say this is frosting it's more of an icing. I was watching a video posted and folding in heavy whipping cream (whipped) into this mixture is an awesome way to make frosting.

The best cream cheese frosting!! Not sweet at all! If you like sweet frosting, just add more powder sugar, but it is amazing as is. You can also add heavy cream if you want a fluffy frosting.

I followed the recipe exact. It was too sweet and somewhat dry. There was also not enough cream cheese flavor. Next time I will use less sugar. Other than that, it's a great foundation to start your own versions.

I've used it twice. The first time it was very good, but not stiff enough.  The second time I cut the recipe in half, but with 1&1/2 cup of conf. sugar.  I liked the way it turned out.  I frosted the top and side of the choc chip pound cake.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Although I did have to make some changes. I used 1 stick of cream cheese instead of two. I also used 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2. Another thing I did, is use 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. I did add 1/2 a tsp. more of vanilla than the recipe called for, and my end results were DIVINE! I certainly will be making this again!

Made this over the holidays and it turned out very good. You'll definitely want to refrigerate the frosting afterwards because it was pretty soft after you beat everything together. It yielded enough to pipe over 24 cupcakes.

Cream cheesy goodness! I made this to go on a carrot cake and it is PERFECTION. I made the recipe just as it was written. I don't like my icing mind-numbingly sweet, so this is ultimate recipe for me. Love it!

I was making a small patch of this, so I eyeballed the portions and taste-tested it from there. I only had granulated sugar, so I used my coffee grinder to get the texture I needed. Everything turned out perfectly!

Great Recipe - such a rich cream cheese flavor! I didn't use butter, and whipped the sugar and cream cheese together to give it a light creamy texture. Cheesecake lovers will LOVE this!

Honestly i think this has become my go-to frosting. SUPER easy and it tastes amazing! I used it on my carrot cake and it was perfect. Only thing I changed was doubling the sugar, so that it's more sweet rather than cheesy.

I was a little worried about using this recipe after reading the reviews but decided to try it out anyway. I scaled it down (using the adjust recipe function) to suit the amount of cream cheese I had and followed the measurements to a tee. The results was a deliciously fantastic frosting. No running whats so ever, just soft creamy cheesy taste, not too sweet. My friends loved it on the red velvet cake I made.

I love this recipe, easy to make. I added 1 tsp lemon extract & that made it even more delicious. Had to contain myself from eating it by the spoonful. Highly recommend this. It's also a plus it you're a cheese cake lover.

This icing is good. I made it as written except tasted it after 1/2 c sugar, 1c sugar, and then the full 2 cups. All ways were good, just depends what you like. It still seemed to lack a certain something though. I tried adding another 1/2 t vanilla, and then a pinch of salt. I think this helped, but still lacks the amazing taste I'm looking for but still haven't found (except at a certain cupcake shop). But still a good recipe, and the best cream cheese icing I have ever made myself.

It needs more powered sugar than they called for.  I cut the recipe in half and used almost 2 cups of powered sugar.  I thought it was pretty buttery and not sweet enough.

Bad recipe... calls for half the butter and 1/3 the sugar of traditional cream cheesing frosting recipes. The moment I tasted it I knew. Thankfully I have a kitchen aid so fixing was no problem.

This is a wonderful recipe! I also cut the cream cheese in half and added cinnamon but that was it. Delish! Definitely a keeper. I creamed the butter and sugar first, then added the cream cheese. It was the perfect thickness for icing my 9" cakes. Just get it in the fridge after if it's hot in the house!

I use the same recipe and it's meant for a double layer cake. Sheet cakes would take less. Now, if you like a good thick layer of frosting,  it would be perfect for a sheet cake. No need to make any changes in the measurements.

This frosting is the best.  I've added other flavorings instead of vanilla and it's yummy.  Maple frosting on fresh apple cake is the best!

There's no way that this recipe the way that it is written is what is in the picture on the cupcakes.  It's a icing.  Not a frosting.  You're definitely not going to be piping this one out of your pastry bag.  I'm giving it a "1 star" not because of taste, it tastes good, but because it is poorly represented.

I have made this many times. Best frosting recipe ever. I use it when I make Pumpkin Spice Cake or Red Velvet Cake. It is very rich tasting and not overly sweet.

My favorite cream cheese frosting recipe. If you like it sweeter, just add more powdered sugar, otherwise it is good the way it's written.

Great recipe! After reading the ingredients, I doubled the recipe since it was for a 9"x9" 2 -layer cake and it worked well. The only change I made was to make my own powdered sugar from raw unrefined sugar in a food processor. If not for my poor frosting skills, I'm sure it would have looked nicer. A bonus was that I did have some left over frosting to use for graham cracker spread or for a small batch of cupcakes :). This was the perfect, NOT too sweet cream cheesy frosting recipe I was looking for. Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic recipe! I only used 1 block of cream cheese as it was all I had on hand, and I used 1/4 c butter. The flavor is to die for! By far one of our favorites, I will use this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

I think the proportions of the ingredients are a bit off. I halved the cream cheese and used twice the sugar and used a bit more butter.

Just tested this for an upcoming party, where I plan to use it on carrot cake, so I only made half a batch this time. My step-son took one taste, his eyes widened, and the words 'Oh..My..God' slowly came out of his mouth. I knew at  this point that the test was a success, so I took the plan a step further and piped the frosting into cut strawberries (am also testing the pipe-ability and it seems fine as long as it doesn't get too warm while mixing), and that was an even bigger hit! It was super easy but looks and tastes extremely extravagant :)

there is no way that video is the same recipe - this was so runny I had to add so much confectioners sugar to even get it to look like it might stay on the cakes.  I have wasted my products and must buy more to make proper icing. Sorry

I thought it was great. Made it really easy to frost my cake and the ingredients were simple. I did add the chocolate and it was delicious. My 10 year old daughter loved it too! Going to make this for the cupcakes tomorrow and add some lemon. :)

I have been making this recipe for years from this page and I just have to say: USE MEXICAN VANILLA it is SO MUCH BETTER that it's ridiculous. 
I have a huge bottle of aged Mexican Vanilla that was given to me by my great grandmother years ago. I never had any idea how amazing it was until we moved again this year and my Vanilla accidentally got packed into a box and stuck in storage. I made this frosting with my sister's ordinary vanilla extract and the result is tasty but the flavor was missing something and I realized it's the deliciousness of my amazing Mexican Vanilla. It just plain tastes better.

I read other reviews first and prepared myself to add more vanilla and sugar, but it wasn't needed; this recipe is delicious as is! It has a great consistency (I was surprised that others mentioned it was runny), isn't too sweet, and the cream cheese flavour really shone through. Definitely making this again!

I followed this recipe exactly the way it says.  It was way too clumpy so I decided to put a 4 tablespoons of butter and the cream cheese in a microwavable bowl along with the sugar on top and put it in the microwave for 15 seconds which makes it easier to mix and creamer.

I made this for my carrot cake.  I did not like and ended up doubling the powdered sugar trying to achieve a normal carrot cake cream cheese frosting.  Maybe this would be better on other things, but I didn't find it nearly flavorful enough for carrot cake....it is a thicker frosting and very cream cheesy.  I wouldn't recommend.

This was delicious, but it wasnt a frosting consistancy.  It also tasted more like cheese cake than frosting.  I added more powdered sugar to make it sweeter for the family's taste.

Great Cream Cheese icing, definitely not the overly sweetened variety. Was just slightly softer than I would have liked but I think that was due to my butter being a little too warm.

I love this recipe and so does my whole family.  I use it on my carrot cake and also cupcakes any flavor.  Sometimes I use almond extract instead of vanilla and add a Tbls. of orange or lemon zest.  Love it!

EASY EASY EASY!  And, soooooo yummy.  I made this for a white texas sheet cake.  I'm concerned it may be too sweet on top of sweet but I'll find out at my party this afternoon.  Make sure your cream cheese and butter are both at room temperature.  It creams so much easier.  It came out light fluffy and smooth.  No lumps.   Easy Peasy!

This was so thin!!! I cut the recipe in half and added about 3 times the amount of powdered sugar, and it was still runny. I think next time I'd try HALF the amount of cream cheese - it made it runny and super tangy.

Tasted great but I was hoping to pipe this on the edge of the cake and it was just not the right consistency.  I bake a lot, I will have to play with this recipe to thicken it.

I made this recipe with the ingredients as suggested by PABBYDOG. It has a great taste, which not too sweet. It has a good consistency for spreading over the cake. I baked Red Velvet cake in a 9 1/2" Bundt pan and needed halve of the Cream Cheese Frosting to cover it.

I put 1 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla extract in due to my taste buds not liking the first batch I made.  I also made sure that my butter and cream cheese were incredibly soft before creaming them together.  One thing that is important is to add the confectioners sugar in increments, not all at once.  I then mixed it on level 6 on my kitchen aid mixer until impeccably smooth and light.  I used it on my pumpkin bars.  This time it turned out better than those expensive little bakery cupcakes you pay $4 a piece for!

Went with other reviewers recommendations and used 3 cups powdered sugar instead of just two to make it a little sweater and to thicken it up a bit.

I didn't care for it because it is not very sweet.  It did frost a sheet cake and has quite a strong cheese taste, if that is for what you are looking.

The taste was pretty tangy so once i added another half cup of powdered sugar it was fantastic, however it was really runny and was like frosting a cake with conditioner. Maybe i've just been working with butter cream too much.

This was good, but I tweaked a few things. The cream cheese was pretty strong (I like mine a bit sweeter). I added a few more teaspoons of vanilla and added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe to 1/4 because I didn't need that much. This amount fit perfectly into a 1 cup pyrex storage round.

Awesome!  Great cream cheese flavor.  Beat all ingredients together at once and frosted my cake beautifully. Could not wait to "soften" the butter and cream cheese and still came together great!  Thank you for sharing~

Very good.  However, used stevia, and significantly less than the equivalent of the 2 cups called for.  If you are on a limited (or no) sugar diet, this works nicely with the stevia equivalent of 1/2 cup of sugar (I used 12 packets).

I hate frosting, but this stuff is delicious.  I don't generally like things to be overly sweet, but I use twice as much sugar as the recipe calls for.  This is pretty tangy as-written.

I added about 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk (maybe more? I didn't really measure) and less then a cup of powdered sugar. With the changes it was smooth and delicious, not too sweet! I would recommend adding milk to make the frosting more spreadable and add your sugar by taste before you throw 2 cups in. Enjoy!

I like this recipe because it's not too sweet and uses half the butter of other cream cheese frosting receipes. I doubled the vanilla and added the zest of one lemon. Let's see how it looks on my Valentine's Day Red Velvet Cake!

Turned out super runny. I was hoping for a thick frosting I could pipe on top of the cupcakes.  I even added more butter, more cream cheese and more powder sugar to make it firmer, and it was still "soupy".  Disappointing.

This served as a great starting point, but like other reviewers I found the proportions to be off; namely, the recipe does not include enough confectioner's sugar. For me it had nothing to do with sweetness or flavor (I happen to like a cream cheese frosting that really does taste like cream cheese), but with consistency. The frosting this recipe yielded was far too soft and thin to put on the cake for which I made it-- it would have all dripped right off in a matter of minutes. Luckily, it was the week of Christmas, and I was doing lots of cooking/baking, so I just happened to have an additional bag of confectioner's sugar on hand; and it took almost the entire bag to get the frosting to a consistency that would not drip like goo off the cake. Having said that, once the consistency was corrected, the taste was perfect. I'll temper all this by also saying that it was pretty rainy the whole week leading up to Christmas, so perhaps the air was more humid than normal and that accounts for some of the problem?  At any rate, I'd suggest giving this recipe a try, but be prepared that you might need to add extra confectioner's sugar. Fortunately, the sugar isn't expensive, so buying an extra bag isn't cost-prohibitive. Also be prepared that if you must add as much sugar as did I, you will end up with almost twice the frosting you probably need! You'll have to find reasons to smear cream cheese frosting on different foods for days (not the worst problem in the world :-)  ).

Excellent recipe. Rich, tangy, sweet... Mmmm. I love cream cheese icing, and this one is great.

For Piping READ THIS!

Use all room temperature ingredients and make as directed, but add and extra cup of confectioners sugar. Yes, it does make it sweeter, but it is the only way this will stand up to piping. Depending on climate, humidity, and many other factors, you may need more/less sugar. Once it's whipped, the icing should hold a medium-firm peak. Use Philadelphia cream cheese, and do not use light... full fat regular is the only way to go. Pipe it chilled ( I chilled mine for a few hours). It will still be softer than, say, a buttercream, but your piping will hold.

Once I piped this on cupcakes and let them sit for a few hours in a pretty warm house full of people, it held.

You could go ahead and use it as written and pipe it cold, but it may fall as it warms up... what's the point in going to the effort of piping gorgeous swirls only to have them fall? Before I added the extra sugar, it was a bit soft for piping, IMO.

It is great on its own. But if you want to make a bit of a lighter icing, I just added some whip cream to it. (already whipped). It was really good.

LOVED IT!! if yours was runny than you did something wrong. DON'T put your butter in the microwave to soften it. Put it out on the counter for a couple hours. Also taste it before you add more sugar because I like it kind of tangy. it tastes great on chocolate cupcakes or carrot cake.

I made a red velvet cake with this frosting piped on the top. This was the best cupcakes I have ever made. They were moist and full of the wonderful cream cheese flavor!!! I added lemon shavings for a little zest. This frosting is perfect and works perfect with a pastry bag.

The icing was great tasting probably the best I've had yet however it wasn't the best for piping which I had hoped it would be from the photo :/ next time I would chill the icing for a while before applying to the already cooled cupcakes for easier piping

This is the frosting that my mom used to make, not too sweet, just how I remember it! Only used 2c. of powdered sugar but used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Also made sure that the cream cheese and butter were soft. Held up well not thin or runny at all.

I made this but basically used it as a jumping off point to create my own. I added about a half cup of pineapple tidbits and tinted it with a bit of red and yellow food colouring so I got a pale peachy colour. I also added a bit more icing sugar so that I got the consistancy that I wanted. I used it to frost a carrot cake I also find on this website. Yum!!!

I found that this turned out to be to creamy and runny....not the consistency that I was looking for, but it was very sweet as is so didn't want to add more sugar to try to thicken it up.  It was still runny after being refrigerated.
Flavour was just okay.  I will be looking for other recipes

I am not a cream cheese lover at all, but I tasted it and thought it was nice.
Anyways I totally screwed this up by adding 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2.
Everyone loved it just the same.

Wasn't quite the consistency I was looking for.  I added quite a bit of powdered sugar to make it stiffer, but it still wasn't stiff enough to decorate with.  Otherwise, it was a very tasty frosting.

It was delicious, but it was too thin. I thought that might be because my cake was slightly warm when I frosted it, but after it was completely cooled, the frosting just slid off the cake like a Salvador Dali piece! I'd use it again, but i want to edit it so it's not so runny.

Only changes I made were making it sugar-free using Splenda that I ran through a processor to make it finer like confectioners sugar. I then added a tsp of orange extract to go with the cake I made. It was still a little buttery for my taste but e drone else liked it.

Slight changes according to a review made by 'Pabbydog" - I made a 9x13 carrot cake and had more then enough of frosting by using:  1 - 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, and 2 c. powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  This was just perfect and the taste was super delish!

Very easy and delicious frosting.  I used this to frost some dark chocolate cupcakes.  I did end up adding an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, but it was also delicious without that extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.  I took the cupcakes to a birthday gathering, and everyone seemed to appreciate having frosting on the cupcakes that wasn't excessively sweet.

I was making raspberry vanilla cupcakes, and wanted something tart for the top.  This was perfect solution for me.  The frosting tasted better than store bought, I used only half all the ingredients for my batch, than added raspberry puree to give it that perfect pink color and just the right amount of tartness!  The frosting turned out so good, I had to hide it from myself! :)

Just made this frosting for almond cupcakes, LOVE IT!! Made frosting exactly as posted and find it the perfect, not too sweet topping. The consistancy was good for piping onto cupcakes. Would be a perfect topping for cinnamon rolls.  Hell I would eat this by itself!! Also seperated out a bit of frosting and added a splash of lemon juice and a few shavings of lemon rind for a future recipe. WONDERFUL This will go into my favorites file.

Excellent and easy frosting! As others suggested, I doubled the confectioner's sugar and the vanilla and came up with a flavor that beat the canned stuff easily!

I made this for a lemon cake with raspberry filling. We don't like really sweet frosting so I cut the powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also squeezed in about 2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. This is an excellent recipe. And as other reviewers have stated the butter and cream cheese MUST be room temp. I would recommend letting cake sit out about 1 hour before serving.

very yummy, made it for a pumpkin cake recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/downeast-maine-pumpkin-bread/detail.aspx).  I ended up with 2 'sour cream' containers of leftovers.  But I 'watered' down half of the recipe (by adding whole milk slowly) so that I could drizzle over the cake instead of layering it on thick.  It was very yummy.

Tried this recipe for my son-in-laws chocolate birthday cake because he wanted a cream cheese frosting. I made it exactly like the recipe called for and it turned out perfect. Made a double batch and had enough leftover for my pumpkin chocolate chip muffins which also were delicious with this frosting!

I thought this recipe was great as is! I used it to decorate mini pumpkin cupcakes. It piped on beautifully then my daughter added sprinkles. I put the cupcakes in the fridge to set the frosting as the party was a few hours off. The frosting has a nice sheen and is plenty sweet for the kids and not too sweet for adults.

Really good frosting although I have a similar version that calls for twice the vanilla and after having both within 2 days of each other- the one with more vanilla is better.  I used this to frost a carrot cake (sam's from this site) and it was good but not enough to frost the double layer.  I ended up having to make another 1/2 batch.

Make this frosting with melted bakers chocolate and that will solve the "too cream cheesy" taste. I have gotten a ton of compliments on this frosting.

Delicious!! I have made just as written and with a tweak or two and I've never been disappointed! For those who are finding it too runny, two things come to mind. First, you must use either real butter OR the baking margarine. Light margarine and whipped margarine will NOT work in this recipe. Also, make sure it is softened from sitting at room temperature, not from being softened in the microwave -- this changes the consistency and will cause your frosting to become thin instead of thick and creamy. Hope this helps some future bakers some!

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted! I didn't change one thing about the recipe, and it came out perfect. Great cream cheese taste, perfect consistency for spreading on a cake, and not too sweet. It was so good I was tempted to eat the leftover frosting right out of the bowl after I finished icing my cake.

Perfect, perfect, perfect!  I cut the recipe in half to use on pumpkin bars.  The only thing I didn't do was wait for the butter and cream cheese to soften, so the frosting wasn't as smooth as I would imagine it should be, but it is perfect otherwise.  It's not too sweet and not too tangy.  I am going to use this recipe any time a cream cheese frosting is called for, that's for certain.

This frosting was very soft and won't stand up. I kept increasing the powdered sugar until it had 8 cups (that's 4x the recipe)!  It's better now but not like the picture.

I did not care for this recipe. If you only use the small amount of sugar called for you have basically a butter cream cheese spread.  it is not sweet. It doesn't even taste like icing. In order to make this recipe work, you need to add at least another cup of sugar. I used 2 cups more of sugar. I also added a pinch of salt. Prior to adding the salt, it still had a bland flavor, even though I used very good (Madagascar)  vanilla and all that sugar.

Not a big frosting fan - BUT.......this was very tasty..... lip smacking even. :-)
I made this to top off a spice cake that I made the night before.
It was an excellent compliment. :-)

I love this recipe!  This is my  go to frosting recipe for birthday cakes (I don't like butter cream).  The only change is that I use 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar in it.

this is not a wimpy frosting.  It goes well with a cake that has a rich flavoer such as a spice cake.  I usually pair it with carrot cake that has raisins, nuts, coconut in it.  It is sweet without being overwhelming.

I had 24 carrot cupcakes to top and about 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese, so I used about 3/4 stick of butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2+ tsp. lemon juice, and a little more than 2 cups of the p-sugar. It is scrumptious, but after a generous topping on the little cakes I still had almost a cup left over. Tip: to best save for future use, chill and press film-wrap on top to remove any little air pockets before sealing container(works great on a lot of things!). Now all I have to do is figure out what to use the leftovers on!

It was good. Needed a lot more powdered sugar to make it the consistancy I like. (more like a frosting) I would soften the cream cheese before use.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  I made a last minute chocolate cake and found I had the ingredients for this frosting.  It was just enough tangy to cut the sweetness of the chocolate.  Don't change anything.  It was perfect consistency, not to runny and tasted great.  Will definitely use this again!

Amazingly creamy-cheesy flavor.  Beautifully spreadable.  Left out about 2 Tbsp. of the sugar, and it spread onto a three layer cake perfectly well.  Not like decorator icing, but like a nice icing all the same.  Best of all, I used non-fat cream cheese - so I'm not eating gobs of fat, just a lot of butter, but not a lot of butter and cream cheese fat too, *&* I don't feel like I'm eating pure sugar.  Goes so well with Sam's wonderful carrot cake from this site.  Thanks so much for helping me find an icing I actually enjoy.  (yep, I usually just use a touch of powdered sugar, which is usually fine, but sometimes a cook does want that iced finish.... now I've got a great recipe for an icing in my repertoire)

Loved it!  I only had 1 block of cream cheese, so I used everything the same except that.  It turned out really yummy.  I think the whole amount of cream cheese would be even more rich and delicious.  Next time I'll make sure to have both bars of cream cheese!

Yum. But use only one 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, and 2 cups of sugar. Add as much vanilla as you desire.

This is fabulous frosting.  I only need a little more than a cup of frosting (1 9x13 carrot cake and my family likes less rather than more frosting.)  After cutting the recipe in 1/2 I added 1/2 extra sugar to help it be a little thicker.  I also was using cold cream cheese (1/3 fat) and butter so I put it in a glass bowl and put it on top of a bowl full of hot water (double boiler style, just no on my stove) that made it easier to combine the ingredients.

This is a great cream cheese frosting to have in your repertoire.  I had to halve the recipe as I only had one tub of cream cheese but it still came out great

I used this with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake, and it was FABULOUS. It is NOT particularly sweet, as other reviewers have said, but for carrot cake it was absolutely perfect. :-)

this recipe is very tasty.. only problem was the consistency. It was too thin, and well if u want to pipe this frosting just doesn't work very well. I had to add more sugar for a thicker consistency.

This is a great frosting, didn't change a thing and everyone loved it (even the kids). So much better than pre - made frosting that tastes too sweat or like foam. Nice to know whats in what you're eating.

This is my absolute favorite frosting to make.  I use it primarily to fill the Cream Cheese Cookie Cups from this site, as it is not too sweet and compliments the chocolate chip cookie cups so well.  So yummy!

I love this recipe!  It is the perfect balance of flavor and sweetness.  I have never liked Cream Cheese frosting because they are always too sweet but not this one.  Everyone in my family including my very picky nephews loved it.

I followed this recipe to a T. It tastes good, but it it difficult to spread or pipe. I have a cream cheese frosting I adore (a cream cheese Swiss meringue butttercream) , but I made this one because the cake would be sitting out for a bit and my usual frosting melts at room temperature. Needless to say, this one didn't work out for what I needed. I doubt I'll use it again.

I love making this recipe! Once you mak your own frosting you will never want to buy it from the store. AMAZING On red velvet and carrot cake... I used Duncan Hine's red velvet cake mix and filled mini cupcakes. Put them into the oven and then let them cool completely. I take a pastry bag and fill it with frostng. Then I push the icing into the cupcake and (using the point like a star on the pastry bag) I keep a little amount of frosting on the top. They are easy to make and I always bring them to parties. They are a real hit!

10 stars!! Truly amazing. Cream cheese at room temp, butter slightly melted. I added 1/4-1/2 cup more powdered sugar for a slightly sweeter flavor. Perfect texture. Have to make another cake tomorrow or I'll just eat it by the spoonful and make myself sick! THAT GOOD.

I choose my baking flavors around wanting to use this frosting. It holds up well and ices beautifully. I often add extra powdered sugar, but it depends on the audience. So good.

This was my first time making homemade frosting, and it came out very well.  I added the sugar gradually, tasting it, to get it to the appropriate level of sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was a great recipe, however a bit sweet.  I think I will half the sugar next time.  A co-worker of mine puts shortening instead of butter and it is quite yummy.  Maybe I will try that too.

This is how I make cream cheese frosting because I like to really taste the cream cheese and find other recipes too sweet.  This is PERFECT on a good, moist carrot cake.

I was looking for a basic Cream Cheese frosting and came across this recipe. I altered it slightly because I needed to double the recipe and didn't have enough cream cheese on hand. I replaced half of the cream cheese with Mascarpone ( a slightly sweeter and lighter cream cheese). I also added a couple of teaspoons of Marsala wine and and an additional 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar. Finally I added some cinnamon (to your desired tasted).  This resulted in an extremely light and airy texture, without taking away from that beautiful cream cheese taste. My family and friends love the recipe so much, this has become my new go to recipe!

This is a great recipe. I cut it in half as I made 15 cupcakes and didn't need 3 cups of frosting. I also used about 3/4 stick of cream cheese instead of the whole thing. This tasted great. If you like the really sugary cream cheese frosting this ISN'T for you. This tastes like you're eating cheesecake! So delicious.

Great basic recipe.  I used even less sugar, because I like mine tangy (and more vanilla).  Adding coconut to it, too, to give it a little something extra.  Thanks for the great foundation recipe!

The taste of this icing is good, but it turned out so runny that I cannot use it.  I began to ice cupcakes with it, but the icing just runs down the side of the cupcakes.  I'm not sure if it's just me, but I did follow the directions exactly.  Very disappointing.

I liked it but it tasted like cream cheese. It's too runny even when I refrigerated for 18 hours. I added another cup of sugar and it tasted great but was still wayyy too runny. It goes very amazingly with red velvet cake.

Delicious. This frosting was perfect on chocolate cupcakes, and a carrot cake. I used less cream cheese, about 11 ounces, and used half a teaspoon more vanilla. It was so delicious, I had to stop myself from eating the bowlful before putting it on the cake!

Not too sweet, very creamy, I had no problem spreading this over a spice cake.  Excellent just the way the recipe is written.  BUT, some people may not like the stronger taste of cream cheese in this recipe.  I happen to love it.

In my lifetime I have wanted to marry few inanimate objects. More often than not these are things like shoes and purses and dresses. As an avid baker, I have never wanted to marry my food until tonight. This frosting is the new love of my life. It is not an overly sweet frosting so it works well as a base for butter cream piping. This will be my new go to frosting. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. It truly deserves like 50 stars.

Happy baking!

Fantastic recipe! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect for a sweet vanilla cake I made. It isn't sweet, but tastes almost like a cheesecake. I am going to try almond flavoring the next time I make it. Super easy to make. Thank you!

I'm confused how the person who posted this recipe got their frosting to come out of the pastry bag and hold its shape.  Mine is failing miserably and I've probably put 3 full cups of powdered sugar in mine...It tastes great though.

Ummm, this frosting is EVERYTHING! It is very cream cheesy. I made it last night to top carrot apple cupcakes. It, of course, needs to sit in the fridge to stiffen back up, but I found absolutely NOTHING wrong with this recipe. I will be using it over and over and over. I can it by the serving spoon full.

This is the BEST cream cheese frosting recipe, just follow it as written.  I frost apple spice cupcakes and it was the talk of the town.  This will be my cream cheese frosting from now own.  Going to do this for valentine's day for the office.  Going to be another hit.

As a true lover of cream cheese frosting, especially on carrot cake, it's rare to find a recipe that compares with the best I've EVER had!  I didn't change a thing (LOVE the extra creme cheese) except for adding Kahlua instead of Vanilla (kinda same thing - eh?)..  Turned out better than awesome and can't wait to show it off!

This is the best cream cheese icing I've ever had. The only thing I did differently was to add 3 cups of icing sugar instead of 2. Perfect consistency and flavor.

Great cream cheese frosting recipe. Followed the instructions exactly, just made a smaller batch(1/2). Great cream cheese flavor. Used it to ice a red velvet bunt cake. Came out perfect. Will be my "go to" cream cheese frosting recipe from now on. Thanks for posting!!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it came out wonderfully!  I can not fathom how some people have ended up with a watery frosting or one that even remotely resembles a glaze.  I piped the frosting onto one dozen pumpkin spice cupcakes and they were amazing.  I made them for a large group of people and received compliments from everyone who tried them, they all loved the frosting!

Perfect! I didn't change a thing. I like that this recipe is so versatile; it's delicious as is or it can be combined with other flavors for a more unique creation. I'm not usually a frosting fan, but this gets my thumbs up.

Absolutely delicious! Just made it to top my chocolate chip pumpkin cupcakes (using http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pumpkin-cake-iii/detail.aspx)! Can't wait to see what everyone at work thinks of it tomorrow.

This is a wonderful frosting. Will keep this recipe for future use. Wasn't quite stiff enough to stay put on the sides of a layer cake but I just didn't frost the sides. A little rustic looking but it was great & allowed the cake to be the star of the show.

Excellent recipe. The amount of sugar can be increased or decreased to personal taste, but the result is a creamy heaven.

Followed everything as it is except I Used 1 cup of icing sugar instead of 2 cups. You could taste the cream cheese with just the right amount of sugar. Will use this recipe again. With the same adjustment

This was only okay to me.  Actually I bit sweet as I prefer a cheesier frosting.  Plus, not quite enough for a two layer cake.

Very nice frosting!  Used more sugar to cut the tartness of the cream cheese.  I had to omit the nuts since my neighbor has a nut allergy so instead of vanilla I used a walnut liqueur. It really added a nice flavor.  I will be using this recipe again - thanks!

This was really good, but for me, I needed way more sugar.  I used this with a strawberry cake which had whipped filling and fresh strawberries. I definitely needed something a little sweeter, so I nearly tripled the sugar.  It was perfect.

I made this to top a strawberry cake I made for father's day. I substituted strawberry cream cheese for the original and added an extra cup of powdered sugar, along with a teaspoon of lemon. I let it chill then frosted the cake. It was absolutely perfect and I will definitely use this recipe for many other cakes.

This is perfect for my mother in laws award winning carrot cake.  I needed an easier frosting than the cooked one that accompanied the cake recipe.  Our family, even the kids LOVED licking these beaters!  Will definitely use it again, can't imagine what cake it wouldn't be fabulous on.  I did increase vanilla to 1T and rest of recipe was kept the same.

It tasted okay, but i didn't melt the cream cheese prior to mixing with the butter and it never blended.  it made little chunks like cottage cheese that i couldn't get rid of even with stove top and microwave heat.  had to throw it out, the texture was just too unappealing.  could be remedied by microwaving first i think.  pretty pertinent information, should be in recipe.  what a sad, expensive mistake. :(

I loved this recipe.  It's ridicuously easy to make, and it's like eating creamy cheesecake!  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it wasn't a big hit with tweens at my daughter's party.  A number of them left the frosting on the plate.  My family found it delicious, and not disgustingly sweet like many of the frostings out there.  To each his own! I will absolutely use  this recipe again.  I can't wait to start experimenting!

This is good but tastes like cream cheese.  I changed it a little and added 2 more cups powdered sugar and it is perfect for frosting cakes and the flavor is better but still not too sweet.

Delicious recipe! It is perfect for people who aren't big fans of the sugary frostings sold in stores. It goes well with sugar cookies, balancing them out to not be so sweet. I cut the recipe in half because I don't always frost the whole batch of cookies, but it didn't matter because halving it was still enough for 26 cookies. Great recipe!

Best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. It's also really easy to make. Tastes like cheesecake! I use about 2 1/2 - 3c of sugar, depending on what I use it for or who its served to. Very good!

Very tasty, smooth and flavorful. The powdered sugar doesnt overpower the cream cheese, as in some frostings. Frosted Carrot Cake III with this. Perfect combo! Fiance adored it! This is my go-to recipe for cream cheese frosting.

Very good frosting!!! Taste is great. I halved the recipe and used more sugar. Used 8 ounces of cream cheese, 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Found that it wasn't very fluffy but very creamy and smooth. I was expecting a fluffy icing, so that's the reason for only 4 stars. However, the taste was wonderful. There was enough (with the measurements above) to not overly frost about 20 devil's food cupcakes.

The frosting came out perfect! I actually only made one fourth of the recipe to try it out on some carrot cupcakes and it turned out great! The texture was perfect and the frosting was not too sweet, which I enjoyed. This is definitely my favorite cream cheese frosting!

I cut the cream cheese & butter in half & added an extra cup of powdered sugar like some of the reviews said & it turned out too sweet for me.  I still gave it 4 stars because kids loved it.  Next time I'm going to follow the directions exactly.

I bake a lot.  I put this frosting on the blueberry cream cheese poundcake and I have to say it was one of the best cakes I've ever made.  I had to take it to work and give it away.

I like this cream cheese frosting. It has a smooth consistency and tasted great on "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" from allrecipes. I doubled the vanilla. I recommend starting with all ingredients at room temperature to ensure easy mixing. Some reviewers thought it needed more sugar, but I liked it just the way it is. I would recommend trying it as written first, then add more sugar if it isn't to your taste.

Very smooth. I made this for carrot bread that my daughter requested. It's not too sweet, perfect balance of flavors. Would make an excellent "mock" cheesecake. Will definitely be using this again.

I used this frosting for carrot cake cupcakes.  I think the frosting had TOO much of a cream cheese taste to them.  Next time, I'll probably only use about 3/4 of the cream cheese.

I will never need another cream cheese frosting recipe. The taste is beyond perfect! I added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I love that this frosting isn't overly sweet.

OMG! this frosting is AMAZING! My husband and I don't like very many frostings and if we do we only put a little on cakes, cupcakes, etc. But with this frosting I made a velvet cake roll and it came out perfect! The frosting itsn't too sweet but has that creamy texture! SOOO great, I will use it all the time!!!

Simple, easy, quick and delicious! Put this on my lemon cakes. Good just the way it is, only change is sometimes add a little bit of lemon rind or juice just to go with the lemon cake.

This was easy to make and tasty but had too much of a cream cheese taste for my purposes--I was making the Orange Crunch Cake on this website.  So I added the extra cup of confectioner's sugar as suggested and it was perfect.  It covered a 3 layer cake.

Truly wonderful.  So incredibly rich.  As others say, it is VERY cream cheesy.  Cheesecake in frosting.  I used the regular recipe to do some, then added more confectioners' sugar and made it less cream cheesy for other cupcakes.  People loved both.  People that didn't like cheesecake preferred the ones with more sugar.  :)

Either way- great recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

I halved the recipe for a smaller batch except for the vanilla, which I kept the same.  I found it was a touch too sweet for my liking but went very well with my red velvet cupcakes.  The only problem I had was my own fault - I have a tendency to overwhip icing.  It made it difficult to nicely ice the cupcakes, but again, that's my fault not the recipes.

Great recipe.  I added some rum extract and a bit more butter to play down the cream cheese taste.  It turned out creamy, fluffy and absolutely delicious.  Used with the Cavity Maker chocolate cake from this site, and it was a great combination.

I like the cream cheesiness. I wish I could figure out how to keep the flavor and sweetness level the same and make it stiff enough for piping decorations.

I read some reviews and added 1 additional cup of powder sugar and 1 tsp more of vanilla extract.The frosting came out great and I will never buy store bought frosting again. My hubby said the frosting tasted better than the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake at Cheesecake factory. He said to make him just a bowl of the frosting because it was so good .

Very good taste.  Put in about 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and 1 box of instant lemon pudding mix to make it lemon flavored.  Had to add a little milk.  Turned out great :)

Great, easy, and yummy!   I used reduced fat cream cheese (that's what I had on hand) and did add a little more confectioners' sugar.  Turned out great!

I love this. I'm not very good at frosting that isn't a traditional buttercream, so this was beautifully easy. I used a smidge over 2 cups of powdered sugar and about a tbsp and a half of vanilla, and it's so rich, creamy, and fluffy. PERFECT for chocolate cupcakes!

WOW!!! I can not say enough about this recipe! I have searched for years for the perfect cream cheese recipe and have always been disappointed. I was so disappointed by other frostings that I haven't made it for years...until now!! This is so wonderful, my son said when people ask for the recipe, tell them it's a secret. LOL. Extremely easy, I had the ingredients already on hand. It's wonderfully fluffy, but not whimpy and it is NOT too sweet...YAY!

Just a really simple, lovely recipe that is a snap to make.  I cut back the sugar and it is plenty sweet enough.  Use it on anything and it makes the food!

This recipe was easy to make, great tasting, and a hit with my whole family. The only problem was that the confectioners sugar called for by the recipe was not nearly enough, although I did half the recipe. I'm not sure how much I ended up adding, but I added until the frosting was thick enough that it barely slid off the mixer. If I had to guess, I probably added another 1/2-3/4 cup.

This is definately a very rich and buttery cream cheese frosting. Not super sweet as others have mentioned, which I like. Super decadent! was excellent paired with carrot cake.

I made this frosting tonight for a carrot cake recipe on this site. I cut this recipe in half, simply because I also cut the carrot cake recipe in half. I used one 8 ounce pkg. cream cheese, I used close to one cup of icing sugar. I didnt quite use 1/4 cup of butter...close, but a little bit less. I did use a half tsp of vanilla extract. I just tasted the icing as I went along. It turned out extremely yummy!!! Just perfect on the carrot cake! Thanks for the recipe : )

I halved the recipe but had to add more powdered sugar...a lot more!  It never did get fluffy and when cut, the icing just dripped off the cake.  I tried chilling the icing before putting it on the cake, but it didn't help much.  I'm an experienced baker, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  The taste was fine.  It wasn't the best Cream Cheese Frosting I've ever had, but it was good.

This frosting is super easy to make.  I didn't have cream cheese but I had Neufchatel cheese which I used instead and it turned out great. I am putting in on top of a rich carrot cake so I like that the frosting has just a hint of tang and isn't cloying sweet.

Excellent, delicious, easy!   I did use only 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar though.  I added to taste, because I was making cupcakes for children and I wanted to use as little as necessary.  I would use the full 2 cups though as well, it would just be a little more cheesecake-like in flavor.

Wonderful!  It broke my cheap hand mixer though.  After talking to my mom, she said that once you have some sugar mixed in with the beaters and it starts to get thick that you can hand mix the rest of the sugar in which is what I had to do.  It's delicious and so decadent.  Made a lot which gave me a reason to make another cake!

This was perfect on the Carrot Cake recipe I found on this site. It really does have a tangier cream cheese flavor than what you'll get from a canned frosting, so if you prefer a sweeter sugary frosting this might not be right for you. My family loves cream cheese flavor, though so it was perfect for us!

I made the chocolate variety. I started by adding 1/4 cup Nestle Toll House cocoa powder but ended with 1/2 cup cocoa powder and powdered sugar to taste (1 cup and 3 TBSP). I left the amount of cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract as the recipe states.

This was a delicious Cream Cheese Frosting recipe! I did make a few minor changes though. I used only one 8oz cream cheese package and used 4 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar rather than 2 cups. The consistency is much better. It was delicious!

I will NEVER make another cream cheese frosting again!  This frosting is not sickeningly sweet like canned frosting but that's exactly what makes it so good -you can actually taste the cream cheese flavor & it's delicious!  It's simple, quick to make & ten thousand times better than store bought!  One thing I love about it is that it freezes well so it never goes to waste if you have leftovers!  Thank you so much Janni!

This wasn't sweet enough for me.  This would probably be great if you are looking for a frosting that isn't very sweet, but not for my taste.

Yummy goodness!  Very easy to make.  I only made a half batch because I didn't need that much.  We put it on the Apple Cranberry Muffins from this site and it was soooo good!  :)

I used this on pumpkin spice cupcakes.  I did change it a tad as others have to lessen the cream cheese flavor. I added 1/2 cup of confectionary sugar and 1 tbsp of milk.  Very good.  I also chopped pecans and added to top of cupcake frosting.

This was good and not too sweet, which is what most of my guests said they liked. I like my icing very sweet so I wasn't too impressed but everyone else loved it. Used this with red velvet cupcakes and also used it on gingerbread cupcakes. For the gingerbread cupcakes I added about 1/2 tsp. allspice to the icing and it was awesome!!

YUM! Quick and easy to make. Was very good. Added a little bit of lemon juice to go with the lemon cake I was putting it on. I also added 1/3 cup of additional powdered sugar to keep the consistency. Delicious! Everyone liked it. Made to enough to frost 2 layer 9inch cake. Will defiantly make again.

This is my go-to frosting for every cake I make. People RAVE about my cakes, and I attribute this to the awesome recipes in my arsenal: Easy Eggless Chocolate Cake, topped with this cream cheese frosting (sometimes with Sweetened Whipped Cream between cake layers).   I must note, however, that I prefer a cake frosting to be not as sweet as a regular butter frosting. My husband, on the other hand, would actually like it if I made the frosting sweeter. So bear that in mind, depending on your sweet tooth.

This frosting turned out wonderfully!  I didn't measure it out because I make frosting a lot, but it was great. I added a little more vanilla and cinnamon.

Excellent cream cheese frosting! Not too sweet and great consistency.  Suggest you keep the butter and cream cheese slightly chilled when mixing everything.  Love it with carrot cake!

I really liked this frosting because wasn't too sweet.  It had a good cream cheese flavor without overdoing the sugar.  Just right!  I halved the recipe and frosted a batch of cupcakes with it.

Oh, wow!  I like tangy cream cheese frosting (rather than the really sweet stuff) and this is pretty much perfect in my book.  I only had a small amount of cream cheese and only needed enough frosting for 12 cupcakes anyway, so I just scaled down to 2 oz cream cheese, 1 tbsp butter, and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  FABULOUS!  I can hardly wait to make some more.

SO easy to make. I didn't measure out the confectioners' sugar (just added it as I mixed) either time I made this, and halved the recipe both times and there was plenty for what I was using it for.

I frosted banana cupcakes with this frosting and didn't have a problem with it being runny as others did. I could see how it might be if you were trying to frost the sides of a cake though. While I didn't hate this, I will probably be making cream cheese frosting that doesn't have so much cream cheese in it next time.

Perfect...just as it is...spreadable and cream cheese delicousness...I totally agree with the user who said this is not for someone looking for a frosting with a "hint" of cream cheese flavor...its like speadable cheesecake really...I pair it with pumpkin bread as a spread and its wonderful ...

Very yummy frosting. I enjoyed that it is not as sweet as some other cream cheese frostings I have used. This is my opinion of course. My husband likes another one I do better that has 1 8oz. of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter and more sugar than this. It's just too sweet. This is better and I will start using it!

I made this frosting for pumpkin cupcakes, and it was very simple to make.  I followed some other reviews and added 1 cup of powdered sugar for a little more sweetness and 1 tsp more of vanilla.  After frosting 33 cupcakes, there was about 1 1/2 cups of frosting left over.

I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly every time. Sometimes I notice I need to either add a little more powdered sugar or some milk for the consistency depending on each batch.

I'm a newbie to cooking and baking so I wanted something easy after my attempt at Italian Buttercream failed miserably.  This recipe is simple and GOOD!  I let the cream cheese and sliced-up butter sit on the counter for about 1 hour only.  Then I partially creamed them using a hand-mixer.  I ended up halving the amount of sugar b/c I didn't want it too sweet.  Once all the ingredients were added, then I really whipped the frosting.  It came out tasting like cheese cake and w/ great texture (not runny) so I'm a happy camper!

I think this was a great easy recipe. I love cream cheese and really wanted a QUICK, EASY way to make cream cheese frosting. I don't have much time on my hands so the easier the better.   I altered the recipe a tiny bit. Instead I used 1 1/2 Teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. It was perfect for my fresh baked carrot cake!   I love this website, especially the ingredients section....it makes everything easy for you!!

I followed this recipe exactly as is and it came out perfect. This is the BEST tasting cream cheese frosting I've ever had. Huge plus is how easy it is to spread. More than enough to frost 2 9" round stacked cakes. This willl be my new favorite. I did leave the butter and cream cheese on the counter for 4 hours before creaming making it very easy.

Great taste, but I had to keep adding sugar (almost two boxes!) to get the consistency I wanted.  I will half the cream cheese and butter next time.

I liked this recipe exactly as written.  After reading the reviews I was prepared to add more sugar.  Luckily I tasted it first and thought it was perfect as is.  This is SO much better than the chemically-tasting canned stuff!

This is my first allrecipes review. What an awesome frosting! Unbelievably simple and quick to make, and when mixed with a handmixer the texture is wonderfully whipped and fluffy. What I really like about it is that you could very easily tweak it to your taste without a whole lot of modification. If you make it as is and decide you want it a little bit sweeter, just add in more sugar. If it's too cheesey, add in some butter. Personally, I found it perfect exactly as is...I didn't find it too cheesey at all as other reviewers had mentioned. I made half the batch of this frosting for a whole batch of cinnamon buns and it was plenty. What an easy way to up the wow factor on your desserts...quick and easy luxury!

I was surprised by the actual flavor of this. It basically taste like a "very lightly sweetened" whipped cream cheese, not like a frosting or icing! I made 1/4 of the recipe, because I was planning on using this to ice some cinnamon rolls. But, it was too strong tasting for that, and I ran out of powdered sugar to adjust it. I think it might go good with a carrot cake or baked as a cheese filling in a danish or pastry, because that is exactly what it taste like.

This recipe was super easy and fast. I made as directed initially and tasted. As one previous reviewer mentioned this recipe is great for a strong cream cheese flavor. I added an additional cup of sugar and it was perfect for its intended audience. I will be using this one often. So much better than the premade stuff.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was too thin and not very sweet so I added 3 more cups of powdered sugar at 1/2 cup intervals beating in to taste after each addition.  I was looking for a more thick and sweet cream cheese frosting, however this recipe is between an icing and a frosting in consistency.  I agree with others that this would be a great icing on cinnamon rolls or even on a simple cake but not for stiff piping peaks.  I refrigerated it overnight to give it a little more thickness but when you let it get to room temperature it loses it's shape again and I hate cold frosting/icing on my cupcakes.  I wanted to up the flavor a little more to give it some kind of a boost so I added 1/2 a vanilla bean to the icing.

wonderful, amazing, i did add about 2 tablespoons of vanilla because i love vanilla, also i added 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream;  this really gave it a wonderful texture and taste  (the heavy whipping cream comes in a small milk carton like container if you have not bought it before)

Very good but also added one c. powdered sugar.  Made way too much for 24 spice cupcakes so tried adding cocoa to the leftover frosting out of curiosity. OMGoodness! So yummy! Will be no problem getting rid of that bowl, I'm sure.

I have tried many recipes trying to find one similar to the one our local bakery uses on their scrumptious red velvet cake.  This recipe is an exact match.  This will be my go to recipe.  Thanks for posting!

I have been using this for a month or so now and it is AWESOME each and every time! I have used it on the Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting (minus the frosting in that recipe of course. also, I made the cake into a 2 layer cake and this recipe offered more then enough frosting to put btwn the layers and all around the outside) & Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls. WHAT?!?! Could not ask for anything better!!! Will be my to go to cream cheese frosting recipe here on out! Thank you so much Janni!

I made this using only 1/4 cup of butter.  I found it to be just a tad too sweet, so next time I'll use  1 3/4 C of confestioners' sugar and try it.  Still was good....

Wow.......I just made this for my husband's birthday spice cake.  Great flavor and texture.  My only issue was that my vanilla had gone bad....never had heard of that. (big bottle from Mexico)  Anyway -   I used a teaspoon of molasses and it was so delicious in this recipe and especially complemented the spice cake!!! thanks

This cream cheese frosting is so easy to make and taste way better than store bought frosting! I realized that if you added a little cinnamon to this, it would taste almost exactly like Cinnabon's famous frosting! Yummy!!!  Another idea is to add different flavored liquors such as almond, or orange to give it something extra! All depends on what you're pairing it with. Just a thought...

if you're a cream cheese lover then this is definitely for you..however i found it way too thick for my taste, i recommend using only 1 package of cream cheese. it made me kinda sick and it's also very runny. If you want it sweeter rather than cheesier, add a teaspoon of cinnamon.

I used this recipe with the recipe for simple white cake.  The frosting made the cake much more delicious, and I topped it off with raspberries and blueberries, which tasted well with the cream cheese frosting.

I made Carrot Cake III and, based on recommendations from various cake recipe reviews, I chose this one because people said it was more cheesy and less sweet.  Boy, I wish I'd read all the reviews of this frosting first before I made it.  Mine turned out like soup.  It would be fine for glazing a cake, but not frosting it.  It would just run down the sides, as others have noted.  I added double the powdered sugar called for, and it's still too runny.  If it were just for a regular meal, I'd let it go, but this is for my daughter's birthday today, so I want it to be really nice.  I give it one star only because it tastes good.

I LOVED this frosting! I changed it around a little bit because I didn't have enough cream cheese or butter and I didn't have any vanilla. haha! It was so delicious though! I split it into three and put cocoa in one, strawberry glaze in another and the third one was plane. Topped some made from scratch sugar cookies with it and WAHLA! mmmmm

This frosting is very creamy.  It's not the sugary sweet kind you usually find although I did add an extra cup of powdered sugar and probably could have added another.  Overall very good.

This was AWESOME! I don't know why anyone would change this recipe. It was scrumptious the way it is. I used this frosting on the Carrot Cake I recipe on this site, to which I've made the following changes: I only used 3/4 Cups oil and used 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar. I made this as a birthday cake for my daughter's 1st birthday and it was a complete hit.

This frosting tastes delicious, but my icing was extremely runny. In order to stiffen it up enough to decorate a cake without the icing pooling around the bottom I had to use 3 lbs of powdered sugar.

Pretty good! What I love the most about it is that it's not super sweet. Many cream cheese frostings I've tried tend to be too sugary. It's really cheesy & awesome with carrot cake. The reason there is one star missing is because it's FATTENING & rich.

This is our FAVORITE frosting.  We only bake a few cakes a year, b/c we are health conscious.  When we do, however, this is a must. We always make it as is.  We won one bake off with a chocolate cake topped with the frosting.  Our favorite is to use it to frost a red velvet cake, and then to add pecans on top.  The recipe provides enough to frost our cakes, and some leftover frosting to splurge on.

Perfect, my husband likes it because it's not too sweet. I feel the result is better when you add a half tsp of salt, though.

Very easy, quick and adaptable.  I used only 1 1/3 cup of sugar and it's just as tasty.  Super for on kids' cakes as you can colour it and it's not too sweet.

YUM! Like others said, if you love cream cheese, then you will adore this frosting.  It is so light and creamy and bursting with flavor. I added some grated lemon zest and it was absolutely incredible on top of my chai zucchini muffins.  Bravo!

This frosting is amazing!  I used it on the banana bar recipe and took it to work.  Everyone raved about the frosting!  This will be my standard cream cheese frosting.

Made this recipe to go with the Carrot Cake recipe on this site by AUTUMN/FALL and it was sooo good. I made it just as written and thought it was perfect, still full of cream cheesy flavor even with the full amount of sugar in it. This made enough frosting for me to frost 24 cupcakes and have a whole bunch left over. Think I'm going to make a carrot cake tonight and use the rest of the frosting on that!

I LOVE this recipe.  It is less sugary and cheesier than most cream cheese frostings, meaning, it is better!  It's the best I've ever had and I received rave reviews.  I will never use another cream cheese frosting!

this was exactly the recipe I was looking for. My sister wanted a strawberry cake with cream cheese icing for her baby shower, and after looking at the pictures, and reading the reviews I choose this one. I give it 5 stars for the taste, as it was really good, but only 3 because of the consistency. I know cream cheese frosting isn't very thick to begin with, but trying to ice the cake-a 'baby-belly', made with the Wilton soccer ball pan- was really difficult and messy. I ended up having to cover the cake in fondant, even though my sister didn't want that, because the icing alone just didn't look good. I followed the recipe all the way, but it was just to thin, even after adding about a cup more confectioner's sugar.

I give this 5 stars with one change. I only use 1 package of cream cheese as 2 is just too much. Other than that, its perfect and so wonderful on carrot cake. I have also made a strawberry version of this for a strawberry cake and while it was a bit thinner, it was marvelous! Sooooo yummy!

I didn't really care for this recipie.  It wasn't sweet at all and I had to add a bunch of sugar and it still wasn't sweet enough.  I'm not one of those sweet frosting people either, I actually prefer a lighter frosting, but this one disappointed me.

I used about 1 and 4/5 8 ounce packages of cream cheese and I thought it was a bit too strong,but if you really like cream cheese then the 2 packages would fit your taste.The sweetness was spot on.

This frosting was really good.  I love how it isn't too sweet.  I agree with the reviewer who said it's like cheesecake.  It also piped well.  I used it to decorate a cake iced with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting.  I'll make this every time I want a less-sweet frosting--sometimes buttercream is far too sweet.

This frosting was a surprise - I was worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough, but it was perfect! It really does taste like cheesecake, and is just the right amount of sweet for a heavy cake like carrot or apple. It is not good for decorating, as it stays very soft and gooey, but the taste is out of this world!

This was a perfect frosting for my carrot cake.  I added just a touch of half and half for spreadability, but I'm wondering if I needed to.  It's a rich and creamy frosting.

This frosting has a creamy texture and a rich cream cheese flavor. I added 2 Tablespoons of heavy cream at the end, which added loft and even more richness.  Yes it added calories, but for those times when you want to splurge, try this version and enjoy a modest, yet satisfying serving!

I can't believe I haven't rated this until now.  This is practically the ONLY frosting recipe I use anymore.  I refuse to use canned frostings... the so-called "Cream cheese" frosting in a can taste like chemicals!  This recipe is an absolute WINNER.  I make it exactly as stated, only I cut it in half for the perfect amount for a 13x9x2 cake.  I'd keep it as is if you are making a layered cake.  As others have noted, this is for real cream cheese lovers.  It's not sickly sweet, but very cheesy and delicious.  I've made it for carrot cake, chocolate cake, and most recently, David's Yellow Cake, which can be found on this site.  If you love cream cheese, you will NOT be disappointed!

everyone LOVED it! I didn't sift the sugar. I just measured out, then used a whisk to stir before adding to cream cheese mixture. Make sure yo beat the cheese and butter for at least 5-8 min.

I used this recipe for the orange crunch cake on this site, and I changed it up particularly for the recipe.  I followed the frosting's recipe exactly, and added vanilla pudding mix, orange and lemon zest, and 1, 8  oz tub of whipped topping. This was SOOOO good!! I will be using this recipe again!

I divided the recipe in half as I only had on package of cream cheese. It came out wonderful. This is my new favorite cream cheese recipe.

Can't get much easier than this.  If you make sure that your butter and cream cheese are softened, this recipe comes together in a few minutes and tastes wonderful.  I used this to frost banana bars from this site, and it was just the right touch to finish off those.  Will defnitely use this recipe over and over and never buy canned cream cheese frosting again!

I frosted "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" (from this site) with this for my Aunt's birthday cake and it was a hit. I made the recipe without any alterations and found that the cream cheese flavor was just right.

All I can say is WOW and YUMMY.  This was the first time I have ever made Cream Cheese frosting and I will say it won't be the last.  Put it on a carrot cake its so creamy and tastey.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.   My kids even loved this and my daughter hates cream cheese.

While I used only 1 8-oz pkg of cream cheese, I also added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips which I melted & cooled before blending into the butter & cream cheese and then added the powdered sugar. I used this to frost a banana walnut cake which came out just delicious!

This recipe is so great. I did the 1 1/3 cup butter, 3 cups confectioners' sugar, 1-8 oz cream cheese, vanilla, and used it for frosting for my cookies & cream cake. I was so rich and perfect together!

This is by far the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had! The cheese flavor was present but still light and not overpowering. The consistency was beautifully smooth and spread over my cake like a dream! Try it. You won't be sorry!

I scaled this WAY down  (2 servings) and didn't quite have all the ingredients cuz I'm at work. I didn't have vanilla so I didn't use it, and I used granulated sugar cuz I didn't have powdered so I obviously can't say anything about that.  I like cream cheese frosting, but this recipe was VERY cream cheese-y. I added almost twice as much sugar to get it to my liking. I'm not sure if it would still taste like that even with the vanilla. I'd probably make this again, just with more sugar.

Delicious. I made this for Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (on this site). Was so delicious. Not too sweet. I even dyed a small amount orange and green and shaped as carrots on top of the cake. So cute and perfect for Easter :) Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good recipe.  Not exactly like the frosting at the local bakery.  This was a bit thin or runny. I know I overbeat it so be careful with that. I'll use this again for sure but not sure how people are able to pipe it.  I'll have to play with the consistency.

i absolutely love this recipe! The cream chz comes through so well and if you beat it on high for one minute at the end it holds up very nicely after being piped.

I did as others suggested and used 1-8oz. cream cheese and 1/4 c. butter (I only had 1 cream cheese on hand, as well).  The rest remained the same and it was really good.  I usually do not 'change' recipes the first time, but I had to, and it worked out really well.  I think the way it's written it would have had too much cream cheese flavor, and this way it's not overly sweet but not overly cream cheese tasting either.

I've made this twice, the first time I didn't tweak the recipe and found it a little tangy for my taste. The second time I added an extra cup of powdered sugar as some other reviewers suggested and it was perfect. I was going to let my son lick the bowl but he got distracted with something so I just took care of that task for him :)

This frosting is great, but for cupcakes I still think it's not stiff enough. I cut the recipe in half but used 1 1/2 C of the sifted sugar. Next time I will keep the 2 C of sugar for 1 pkg of cream cheese. I was icing a lemon cupcake, so I added some lemon zest and substituted the vanilla for lemoncello. I think this icing as is would be great for a sheet cake.

Very good basic recipe...my family like it to be a little sweeter. It was fine for me, and I added some toasted chopped pecans. I will make again.

Update 052214...Just made it again. As noted above I made it a little sweeter for my family by adding 1/4 cup of white sugar. Toasted chopped pecans with a little butter. I also added 1 tsp of lemon flavor. Refrigerated over night. Very pleased with this recipe. The four stars are for the original recipe. I don't take away from a recipe when I make the decision to edit it for my personal taste, because then it is a new recipe.

Great cream cheese frosting. I only had 1 8 oz package cream cheese, so I halved everything else. It worked pretty good. My daughter decoreated all the strawberry cupcakes we made with this. She did a great job!!!

This frosting is delightful!  I have actually never made carrot cake or cream cheese frosting and this was just amazing!  I did half the recipe for a layer cake and it was perfect!  Thank you for this great recipe.

Excellent frosting. I did add another cup of powdered sugar, even though I personally liked the tang without it. I figured it would please the majority with a bit more sugar though. Very good. Thanks :)

This is just the standard cream cheese frosting. I added a package of instant vanilla pudding and a few tablespoons of milk to get the right thickness for spreading. Also a little vanilla for more taste. I beat this until it was fluffy.

I tasted the frosting after I blended the first three ingredients together and thought it was perfect. Then I added the vanilla and ick didn't like it! I didn't put more than the recipe called for and am surprised so many reviewers liked more. For me it gave it an overwhelming vanilla taste that killed the cream cheese flavor. Definitely will make again less the vanilla.

yummy! followed this recipe exactly and it is so yummy! i made it originally to pipe on top my cupcakes (chocolate pudding fudge cake). the first cupcake came out really pretty, but it became a little too runny to pipe on after that. i ended up just spreading it on the cupcake with a knife. SUCH a yummy combination!

YUMMY! I followed "Becker J's" advice and only used 1 8 oz. crm. cheese, 1/2 c. butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 cups, sifted confectioners' sugar.  It was very creamy, not to sweet and really really yummy!  It's simple, and sometimes simple tastes the best!

This is a great frosting!!! I did however add two more cups of powdered sugar and I added a 1/2 stick more butter! Other than that I love it! I will be using this over and over again...

Absolutely the best cream cheese frosting I've had. Used it on a red velvet cake today. Have enough left over to put on some cinnamon rolls. Thanks much for sharing this recipe.

So easy and taste so good on about anything that needs frosted. As other post say, you can eat it with a spoon, it is yummy but not overly sweet. I have made it a few times and each time great. I always seem to forget to set the cram cheese and butter out so I toss them in a bowl and microwave them for 15-20ish seconds and then it blends perfect.  Enjoy!  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was tasty but i found that it needed a little more  powdered sugar and the color was to brown so i think that it would look better with non colored vanilla

I thought this was okay.  I had the cream cheese and butter very warm when I whipped them up, so maybe that's why I wasn't able to spread it very thick on top of the cupcake?  Or maybe it was because I didn't use a pastry tip to squeeze it on.  I don't have much experience with frosting, so I will try again after chilling to firm it back up before applying to the cupcakes.  Also, I added more sugar because it tasted too much like cream cheese and not enough like frosting.

halved the cream cheese.  added 1/2 c milk.  used 3 c powdered sugar.  I know that really changes the recipe entirely, but it was my jumping off point and it resulted in the most delicious frosting I have ever tasted.

Didn't hold up as well as I wanted. Next time I make this I will lessen the cream cheese by half. I think using only 1 8-ounce cream cheese would give a more stable frosting and would still taste great.

Wow!!! This is great frosting! Every one who tasted it had to back away from the bowl so they would not be tempted to eat the whole thing! One change that I really enjoyed- I added coconut extract instead of the vanilla. Hello! It was heaven!

With the proper adjustments, this recipe is outstanding.  Double the amount of vanilla extract and/or add vanilla bean seeds from one vanilla bean + increase the confectioners' sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I had leftovers after frosting a 2 layer 9-inch round red velvet cake.  The frosting itself tastes like cheesecake, which is awesome.  The only thing I hate about it is that I have to refrigerate any cupcakes or cakes that I use this frosting with.  Cakes tend to dry out in the refrigerator.  However, that does not matter when the taste, quality, and quantity of this frosting are unbelievably sensational.

I would have given it that extra star had I not had to alter it quite a bit.  I was glad I was tasting it as I was adding all the sugar because I'm not a fan of buttercream frosting (i think it's way too sweet) so I ended up adding half the sugar it requested and added a 1/2 cup of cool whip as well.  It was wonderful this way.  I kind of went off this recipe and the Creamy Cream Cheese Frosting on this site.

This was by far the best frosting I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was just perfect.  I would not change anything about this recipe.  I made white cupcakes, cut a small hole in the center, placed half a strawberry in the middle and piped on a mound of this delicious frosting.  It was a big hit at my Mom's birthday.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was so easy and so so so good, I usually don't even like cream cheese. I did make a couple of changes: about 11 oz of cream cheese, 3 cups confectioners sugar and 1 1/2-2 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste ( i always use vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla)

Great flavor.  The only thing is the frosting turns out not very thick.  Need to make adjustments if you want a thicker frosting.  I will use it again.

This icing is great! We iced a triple pudding layer cake with it. I made half the amt of the original recipe and added an extra 1/2 cup of conf. sugar. Great taste and consistency! Thanks!

Very good, at first there was too much icing sugar, so I added a splash of milk, also added more sugar after that to make it sweeter. A dash of cinnamon tasted good too!

Wonderful! I usually half this and have plenty. Taste a little of the frosting as you add the sugar until it is to your liking. I usually don't add quite as much of the sugar (although it would still be fantastic with the full amount). I just really love the cream cheese taste. My family loves it on a banana cake.

YUM! You can taste the cream cheese in this one! I used it to frost a pumpkin cake. Half of this recipe was enough for a 9x13 cake. Consistency was pretty soft unless you refrigerated it for a while.

This frosting was outstanding!  Definately a true cream chees frosting and exactly what I was looking for.  I used it to frost a pumpkin pie cake for thanksgiving and everyone who had some loved it.  This will be my go to recipe whenever I need cream cheese frosting.

I followed another reviewer's advice and put in half as much cream cheese and butter, and more vanilla. It seemed very good with pumpkin bread, and looked good with cinnamon sprinkled on top.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever made!  I made 1/2 the recipe to frost 18 pumpkin cupcakes and I had just a little extra, which was great on graham crackers as a before bed snack!  I had to refrigerate it for a little while so it was stiff enough to spread nicely, but then it was perfect.

I doubled the vanilla and kept the same proportions otherwise - SO GOOD. I thought I'd be like the other commenters who thought it was too cream cheesy but I loved it the way it was, on top of pumpkin muffins! Mine didnt stand in peaks like in the picture but was creamier.

I made 1/2 recipe of this, which was more than enough to frost a non-layer cake.  I paired this with Rose Levy Beranbaum's Pumpkin Walnut Cake - absolutely awesome!!!  Starting with the ingredients at room temperature (or close to it) made the mixing easy and fast.  I love that it's not too sweet.  Highly recommended!!!

The taste was decent, but it definitely wasn't cake-worthy, as the consistency was much too thin.  It would probably work great on cinnamon rolls or something similar.

Only 4 stars because I halved the cream cheese but oh my goodness this was good. I had to add extra sugar for a thicker consistency but I just chalked that up to the omitted cream cheese. Will make again and again! My family loved it as well.

Absolutely delicious! I only needed half a batch, so I followed other reviewer's suggestions and halved all ingredients EXCEPT the powdered sugar. Perfection!

Excellent frosting. I made this exactly as stated for a carrot cake, and I couldn't stop licking the bowl after I had the cake frosted! I was prepared to add more sugar if I needed to, but I tasted the frosting after I'd put 2 cups in and it was perfect.

EXCELLENT. It's unnecessary to change a THING! I'm usually the one to gather suggestions from user reviews and modify recipes, but I'm so glad that I followed this recipe to the T!   My boyfriend had to hide the frosting from me so I wouldn't eat it all before our red velvet cupcakes (made a recipe from this website) cooled enough for frosting!

I used this icing on Carrot cake from this site.  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sams-Famous-Carrot-Cake/Detail.aspx  I used a tsp more pure vanilla, 1/2 the sugar,but added 1/2 cup of clover honey and juice from one small orange, and a 1/4 cup of butter milk, and a 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream.  This is a great, easy frosting that tastes incredible.  This turned out to be the best carrot cake I have ever tasted!

I used this icing with the Pumpkin Gingerbread recipe (on this site) and it was the perfect match!  I did make a couple changes.  First, I halved the recipe.  Next, I added an extra Tbs of vanilla (as others have suggested).  This first attempt turned out very cream cheesy (but good).  The next time I made it, I halved everything EXCEPT for the confectioners sugar (used 2 Cups).  This time, it was the perfect blend of cream cheese to sweetness.  Also, if you're looking for the great taste, but are trying to save a few calories, you can safely use 1/3 fat Philly Cream Cheese with absolutely NO impact on the final product.  My family thought it was the full fat fare.  :-)  Finally, halving the recipe with the extra cup of conf sugar yielded enough frosting to cover two 9x5 pumpkin loaves.

I used this on a boxed carrot cake and it was awesome. I did use about 1/2 cup more powdered sugar to get it a bit more stiffer, my butter was very soft and it need more sugar because of this. After frosting my cake, I did every thing to get the last drop out of the bowl except to lick it.

Wow, this was so easy that I was skeptical. It's absolutely delicious! I did add 1 additional cup of confectioners sugar and one additional tsp of vanilla. Used this on pumpkin bars and they were phenomenal. Much better than store-bought frosting. It was also fluffier than I expected!

This frosting was SOOOOO good. It was amazing.  I halfed the recipe and used it for a two layer round carrot cake, and it was still too much. Next time maybe I would even make 1/4 of the recipe.

I am not a big cream cheese fan.  But this frosting recipe is amazing.  There isn't much of a cream cheese kick to it.  I made this recipe and put it on top of some Devil's Food cupcakes and the taste was amazing.  The only thing different I did was add a cup of whipped cream.  I will be making them again today.

Excellent cream cheese frosting.  This last time I made half the recipe but added more sugar than required and used it to pipe lettering on a cake.  This is better than store bought with no after taste.

Simple, and FULL of flavor. Used with Cake Mix cinnamon rolls, and I couldn't have had better compliments! It's more rich than sweet, so it really brought our the cinnamon and vanilla flavor in the rolls.

This cream cheese frosting comes out perfect every time.  I make it with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake from this site.  I even once accidentally bought "light" butter and it tasted just the same.  Really good frosting!

This frosting is excellent!  I did double the vanilla to give it an even richer taste.  I also added cinnamon to it and frosted the Pumpkin Cake III, from this site, with it.  It was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I usually can't find a cream cheese frosting recipe that is cream cheesy enough.  This one definitely does it!  I love that it is so rich and full of flavor but is not sickening sweet at all.  My hubby went crazy when I used the frosting to top pumpkin muffins!

This was amazing.  I used it as a starting point, but did taste it after following the recipe exactly-ohhh so good!  Then, since I didn't have enough ingredients for my pumpkin cookies, I just added more powdered sugar and milk until I had enough. Still yummy!

Very rich, but delicious!  I halved the recipe to top the Frosted Banana Bars from this site, and had plenty left over....wish I had something else to frost!  Added more sugar, but couldn't get it to a thick consistency like I wanted.

So delicious. I didn't change a thing so I still have a little left over after frosting my two 8 inch cakes. It has the right amount of cream cheese flavor, without being overly sweet. Definitely a keeper ^_^

This will be the recipe I use from now on!  I didn't read the reviews first, but I too only used 1 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 2 c. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I was glad it turned out wonderfully and was the perfect consistancy and amount for the top of my 9 x 13 cake.  You'll need to make a double batch if you plan to frost sides or layers.  Easy to remember rule of thumb: 2c sugar to every 8 oz. pkg crm.chs.  Otherwise recipes use too much sugar or too much cheese.  Yummy!

This has become my "go to" recipe for cream cheese frosting. I use half the amount of cream cheese (because I only had 8 oz of cream cheese the first time I made it and we all loved it), but I keep the other ingredients the same. It is excellent!

I used this recipe to top "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" on this site. The frosting is so easy to make and we loved the strong cream cheese flavor. I don't think there is any way I could have added another cup of sugar. I found two cups to provide plenty of sweetness.

This frosting is to die for! I used butter flavored shortening which gave it an ivory tint, but it was so good!  There was so much leftover from frosting my cake that I left it in the fridge and my hubby used it to top some cookies with.

This was not a great decorating icing, so if you are looking to make your cake look professional, look elsewhere.  Other than that, the taste is fantastic...personally, it was not the consistency that I was looking for in an icing...I added more sugar to make it stiffer, but still felt like the texture was gummy...being a professional chef, I need to have something more reliable than this...a little too "fluffy".

This is an excellent frosting and I didn't find it to have that 'cream cheesy' taste that everyone keeps mentioning.  It does make A LOT of frosting, so cut the recipe in half if you are frosting a 9x13 or 24 cupcakes.  I whipped the cream cheese, added the vanilla and then added the butter slowly.  I added the sugar until it tasted good to me, so I have no idea how much I put in.  The frosting was light and fluffy and had a nice light taste to it....not overbearing at all.  I frosted my red velvet cupcakes with it and they were dreamy!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I thought it got even better after sitting in the fridge. (Make sure you spread it on your cake before refrigerating, though, as it solidifies considerably.)

I guess I was expecting something a bit different. I followed the recipe exactly, but this was a bit too cheesy for me. I LOVE cream cheese, and I added it to a rich chocolate, thinking they would go well together, but it was just too much. It made a great consistency and is great to decorate, but I will add double the powdered sugar next time, or try out different measurements of vanilla.

Hands down, the best ever. Perfect balance of flavors. After some time in the fridge, PERFECT consistency and holds up well!  I added 4 TBSP of Cool Whip to lighten/fluff the frosting. But it didn't need it at all.

Amazingly good!  I loved that it had a stronger cream cheese taste.  I used the low fat cream cheese and margarine, and it was still pretty thick...and extremely delicious!  Great recipe!

A little too rich of a cream cheese taste for my liking.  I took the advice of some of the reviews and started off with only 8 oz. cream cheese and a little extra powdered sugar.  However, when I taste tested it, I thought it was too sweet, so I slowly added more cream cheese, tasting it all the way.  Eventually I had added the whole second 8 oz package of cream cheese and thought it tasted just right.  But, when I tasted it with the red velvet cake I frosted with it, it was too rich and I wished that I had never added the second cream cheese.  So, be careful when you are taste testing and keep in mind what you will be eating this frosting with.

Amazing recipe! I have made this recipe more times than I can count. Everyone raves about this icing becaue it is not sickly sweet, but smooth and rich. I usually folow the recipe to a T, but have on ocassion added 3 cups of icing sugar. It's so delicious that I'll never look for another cream cheese icing recipe again.

Very good, basic cream cheese frosting!  I only used one cup of powdered sugar and thought it was plenty, but I think it depends on what you're frosting as to how sweet it should be.  Very easy and the only recipe I'll ever need or use!

Outstanding! Very creamy, like whipped cheesecake, and not overpoweringly sweet. It's great by itself, but it also makes a perfect base for extra flavors - since I was frosting a spice cake with it, I added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe.  Even my boyfriend (who usually hates cream cheese with a passion) thought it was good. This is the only cream cheese frosting recipe I'll ever need. :)

This is perfect just as it is. I used this for a raspberry cake I made for my mother. EVERYONE raved about it and I keep getting requests to make more. Definitely a keeper. my Husband asks me just to make the icing for him to eat. :)

I made this wrong, but it was really  really good. I used only 8 ounces of cream cheese and all the other ingredients stayed the same. I ran out of Vanilla before I got around to making the frosting for my strawberry cake, but it was still awesome. I am giving it a 5 because I'm sure it is with the vanilla. As I made it, it was, well about a 4.5 :-) I made filling for the cake with cheesecake instant pudding and whipping cream, but I really wished I had filled the cake with this frosting also. Next time, I certainly will!

Really good and easy. I used powdered sugar and halved the recipe and got enough for 24 cupcakes using a pastry bag.  I would have had enough for more if I would have just used a knife.

This was my first attempt making cream cheese frosting, and I was so happy with this recipe. I made exactly 1/4 of the recipe, and did not change anything. This frosting is much better than the ready to use ones; those are not even comparable to this. It is more like the frosting in a specialty bakery shop. It is not sweet at all, and it the taste reminds me of a good cheesecake but much lighter. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The original recipe was good, but too "creamcheesey" for my tastes (I know some people who aren't in to sweet frosting that would love it though). I only gave it 4 stars because of this. I made some modifications, including adding another teaspoon of vanilla and another cup of sifted sugar, and would give it 5 stars with the modifications. I also refridgerated the frosting for 30+ minutes then pulled it out and re-whipped it because it was so hot in my house... Great recipe!

This is a great frosting for the holiday's when you are baking more than one cake. I used this for my Red Velvet and my Pumpkin cake for my family's Christmas Dinner. They all loved the frosting and the cakes.  Thanks to those who contribute to make allrecipes.com so great!!

Not overly sweet like some other recipes can be, more 'cream cheesy'. I halved recipe to frost a 13x9 'frosted banana bar' recipe from this site. I will use this recipe for other desserts going forward.

Made as is.  Tasted good to me but my hubby said it seemed like it was missing something, no sure what though.  Pretty thin. Ok for frosting but thickened with more sugar for piping.

I used this for the Pumpkin Bars I recipe and it was great.  I didn't sift the powdered sugar (I never do) and it turned out fine.  Very sweet though.

This was so easy and tasty!  Even second graders loved it and thought I put cheese cake on top of the cupcakes.  I will definitely make this my go to frosting.  The recipe made enough to generously cover 28 cupcakes with a bunch left over for eating straight with a spoon!

I made a carrot cake for my husbands birthday and tried this frosting recipe. I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. My husband raved about the frosting and I had a hard time keeping him out of the bowl! Easy and EXCELLENT.

One word - EXCELLENT!  Cut the sugar to  1 1/2 cups.  Perfect compliment to Frosted Banana Bars from this website.

Absolutely a 5-star recipe!  This was delicious.  I used it to frost my daughter's birthday cake and I divided it in half and made half of it chocolate cream cheese frosting by adding some cocoa powder, to taste (and added some brown coloring).  Both the regular and chocolate were excellent and everyone loved them both!  Definitely my new go-to cream cheese frosting now!  It spread great too...best after having sat in the fridge for a short amount of time (not too long though or it'll be too thick to spread). EDIT: Made a chocolate version of this for the second time and gotta say, we didn't really care for it this time around.  I think I'll definitely stick to the original plain cream cheese with this.  Plus, the color is a very light brown, which isn't what I usually want when we want chocolate frosting.

I have to say that this is the most perfect cream cheese frosting that I have ever tried.  It is not to sweet and very creamy.  The recipe says to store leftover in the refrigerator. . .who has leftovers!?  I just hope that there is enough left for the cake that is still in the oven!!!!!

We loved this because it was not too sweet like most icing. I only used 4 tbls softened butter and bumped the vanilla up to 1 tbls. I iced chocolate cupcakes with this. Yuuuummm!

This frosting is fantastic. I think I had a religious experience the first time I tasted it. I put it on cupcakes and everyone said it was the best frosting they had ever had...I usually end up putting in a little more powdered sugar and evening it out with a tiny bit of milk, just until I think it tastes just right for what I'm doing. Also great for piping onto your cakes!

I'm only going to give this a 3 star rating.  It's not that it was bad.  It was just way to cheesy.  I know that it is cream cheese frosting, but I added a ton more powdered sugar and still thought the cream cheese was way to strong.  A lot of my guests liked it, but it's just not that good.  The base was good, but cut out 8oz of cream cheese to get a better taste.

This frosting was amazing!!! I was a little worried about it not being sweet enough. I liked it, but I was making it for someone else and I wasnt sure if they would. The reviews I read said they put 2 extra cups of sugar but I did not want to make it super sweet so I put 1 extra cup. I then used it with the Strawberry cake from Scratch recipe and everyone loved it! I have had soo many people ask me for the recipes. They all thought that the sweetness of the frosting was perfect, not too sweet but not unsweet either.

This is very good. But I think there are other recipes that are easier AND sweeter. This was a little too cream cheesy. Next time I'll just add more powdered sugar.

this frosting is perfect.  make sure you soften up the butter & cream cheese before you start and don't go crazy with the vanilla.  can be colored very easily, just add a couple drops of food coloring while you're mixing it.  it's great on chocolate cake, carrot cake, as a fruit dip, with a spoon, on fingers..

Really good. I added a little extra flavoring, coconut to be exact, and used splenda instead of powdered sugar, and it turned some horrible cookies into a confectionery wonder.

WOW, really, really good.  Not overly sweet.  Cream cheese flavor really comes through.  I used it on a 2 layer carrot cake and it was the perfect amount of frosting, well, if you consider the 4 tablespoons I ate while frosting the cake.  Had to test it prior to serving, lol.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It's very good!  My kids love it, and it sure taste like cheesecake, especially if you mixed it with cocoa powder--it's just like chocolate cheesecake:)

Excellant frosting!  I didn't change a thing.  Seperated icing into 5 small bowls and mixed up different colors of food coloring to decorate cupcakes for Easter!  Great texture.

This is a great recipe. But we have an even easier one, We simply buy a tub of cream cheese frosting and add an 8oz package of softened cream cheese to it. set it in the fridge for about 15 minutes to stiffen a little since beating it thins it. Then you are ready to go. Not too sweet and not to twangy, the kids love it.

Love, Love, Love this recipe.  SUPER easy.  Yes, it tastes like cream cheese which I think is good.  If you want a sweeter frosting all you have to do is add a little more confectioner's sugar :-)

This is a very rich, almost cheese-cakey frosting that peaked the day after it was made. Not too sweet, but full of creamy flavor. Will definitely make this again.

In my opinion; right ingredients, wrong proportions. Too much Cream cheese. Ended up using 8oz cream cheese and it was a better balance.

This was delicious! Put it on a spice cake, it was truly perfect and everyone loved it. I did add the extra vanilla someone suggested but did the rest the same.  I do have some left and plan to put on carrot cupcakes.  Thank you...

So easy and versatile! I added a little red food colouring to make pink icing for the cupcakes I served at our local church play group for Valentines Day. It was the perfect consistency to pipe on with my cake decorating kit (not too thick) to create a rosette effect. A couple of things though; If you've refrigerated it ahead of time you'll want to let it stand out of the fridge for about 10 minutes so it will be soft enough to work with. In the same token once made you wont want to leave them out too long, since the icing does contain cream cheese and will start to go funny after about 30 minutes depending on the temp of the room they're sitting in of coarse!

I was worried with all the adjustments to the recipe posted, but I made it as is.  I think it depends on the item you frost.  I made strawberry cake mix and a chocolate fudge cake mix; so both were very, very sweet.  The slightly tart cheesecake taste really offset the cupcakes and mini-round cakes puuuuurrrfectly.  I dyed the frostings various shades of pink, lavender, etc... for V-Day and am delivering the yummy treats to the local police and fire departments as a thank you.  Thank you poster, this was an excellent addition to my frosting catalogue!

This frosting was wonderful. I just couldn't stop "sampling" it and it ended up being my favorite part of the cake. I wanted a slight lemony flavor, so I added the juice of 1/2 lemon, and doubled the amount of vanilla. Absolutely delicious!!!

This is amazing! I only wish it was a little more stable so I can use it for my decorative cakes. I will probably use a little more butter for that but what a yummo recipe!

This was so great but we added a variation. We used the recipe to the tee except that we added 1/2 cup of the sweeted strawberries in syrup (we buy it in the container in the walmart freezer aisle)It came out excellent...you could vary it according to your tastes but our recipe wasn't as sweet as some because we used it with vanilla cupcakes and wanted a contrast. Definitely one of the best and easiest frostings I have ever made.

This is an awesome cream cheese frosting recipe, I used it over a Red Velvet cake.  Words of warning though....Don't finger taste it in the process, you can't stop and there will be no frosting left for the cake!

This is delicious!  Great on cinnamon buns, cakes, and more!  I double the icing sugar to get a stiffer consistency for cakes.

As others said, add another cup of sugar and you'll be good.  Nothing fantastic about this recipe, but with more sugar it's sweet.

If you like to make cannoli's this cheesy frosting is for you, all you need is cannoli pastry shell, either chocolate chips or finely diced candied fruits to mix in this frosting, fill the shell and dab the ends into chopped pistachio's!

I took others suggestions and cut the amoung of cream cheese in half. I served these at a party on mini blackforest cupcakes and got really great compliments. Surprisingly, people were more interesting in getting the frosting recipe that the cupcake one.

This is a wonderful recipe for anyone who enjoys a frosting that is sweet, but not too sweet, and has a true cream cheese flavor! Yum!! I made a carrot cake using (2) 9" round cake pans. The consistency worked out well and there was a generous amount to cover the top, sides, and middle between layers. This recipe was fantastic - - no need to change a thing!

I randomly made a cream cheese frosting and surpise!...it's the exact same thing as this! I've never tasted cream cheese frosting before so I can't compare. On first taste, I thought it was "different"...not bad but I didn't fall in love either. After refrigeration on top of a red velvet cake, it tasted somewhat better...This frosting is not too sweet (unlike some who wanted to use a whole box of confec. sugar?!?) with just a hint of tartness from the cream cheese. Recommend but eat it cold!

I used 3 C of sugar and used butter flavored shortening instead of butter. One package of the cream cheese was no fat and one was regular.  It was smooth and creamy, ideal amount of sweetness and the perfect compliment to my pumpkin cake.

I made this frosting to go with a pumpkin cake (per other reviewers) and it was delicious!!!  If you are looking for a real cream cheese frosting, this is the one!  I added a bit more powdered sugar to taste, it is a fabulous recipe, will use it again!!

I have made this icing for several cakes: chocolate, strawberry, apple, red velvet; it is amazing on all of them. If you like cheese cake you will want to save this recipe!!

Very very good! Pretty strong cream cheese flavor and really thick, but so quick and easy. I quartered the recipe to frost some pumpkin cookies and it came out great.

Absolute heaven. Soooo creamy and delicious, not to mention easy. I kept everything the same except for adding about 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar. I used the mixture to frost my carrot cake. A perfect 10 in my book. ;)

This was perfect cream cheese frosting!  Not too sugary and really creamy.  Had a great cream cheese flavor, perfect on the carrot cake III recipe.  I changed the recipe a bit by using 3 sticks of cream cheese, 3/4 c butter and 3 c sugar and it was wonderful!!!

I give this recipe 5 stars following the reviews of others using 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 2 c. confectioners sugar, and 1-1/2 t. vanilla.  I used it to ice pumpkin cookies V off this site and it was wonderful!

I only made half of the recipe, but probably should've done the full recipe.  However, on the half...I did have to use 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar, and instead of vanilla, I used Spiced Rum...MMMMMMM, it was good!!  Used it to ice a Pumpkin Spice Cake.....Everyone loved it!!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, it was good but a bit too sweet on top of devil's food cupcakes. The second time I made this I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and an additional 1/4 cup butter. After everything was mixed I turned up the mixer on high and whipped it for about 2 minutes until the frosting was light and fluffy without the use of whipped cream. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious. Not too sweet and  very creamy. This makes a LOT of frosting - more than required for a 9X12 cake. I'll probably cut it in half next time.

WOW! This is an your face cream cheese explosion even after I added an extra cup of confectioners sugar. Though it complimented the carrot cake very well, I found it to be a little runny. I think I will aff 4 cups of sugar next time. Very good base recipe.

Smooth, creamy & yummy!  This was the first time I ever made cream cheese frosting and we loved it.  It's not too sweet and has a wonderful cream cheese flavor.  It was very quick and easy to make.  Faster than a trip to the store to buy frosting.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and maybe add cocoa next time for chocolate frosting!

Really good on carrot cake...I agree with the other reviewers; this recipe makes a TON of frosting. I halved the recipe and used 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 c. butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and a bit less than 2 cups of powdered sugar, and I had more than enough to frost 16 cupcakes.

Fabulous recipe! It does taste just like cheesecake. I increased the conf. sugar based on other reviewers and it was great with carrot cake and cookies. Next time I will halve the recipe because it made more than we could eat!

Will definitely make again.  I added one bag of Nestle's white chocolate chips (melted in microwave).  I had to stop my hubby from eating the icing with a spoon.  Used the icing with a strawberry cake also on this site.  Many compliments from my guests!

MMMMMMMMmmmmmm!  This was great.  I made banana bread and wanted something different from the usual crumb topping.  I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great.  You can really taste the cream cheese - much better than the canned frosting from the store!

This is the best and last frosting recipe you need.  Perfect on Frosted Banana Bars and Applesauce Cake. NOTE: 1/2 of this recipe will cover a Bundt cake.

This is delicious! I kept everything exactly as the recipe stated, EXCEPT, I used only 8oz. cream cheese (instead of 16oz.). I was able to frost 24 Red Velvet Cake cupcakes with that amount.

This is a pretty good cream cheese frosting and spreads nicely onto a cake without too much hassle. I did add an additional cup of confectioner's sugar to make it a bit sweeter as I wanted it a bit sweeter for the cake I made, but I also tasted it before adding the additional cup and it's still quite good without additional sugar. It has a nice not very sugary-sweet cream cheese flavor without the additional cup, and even one more cup still didn't make it overly sweet, so I would recommend it either way. That's the beauty of frosting - taste it and add more sugar if it's not enough for you!

I halved the recipe, which was a big mistake.  I couldn't stop 'tasting' it while the cupcakes were baking, thus I didn't have enough.  Will double next time, just in case.

i realized that I only had one package of cream cheese, so I ended up making a buttercream-cream cheese frosting. I followed all the ingredients, only using one package cream cheese, and 2 teaspoons vanilla and another 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. It turned of fantastic, and the taste of cream cheese was still there and very good. 
I know I made alterations to the recipe, and usually am against those who review negatively after they have changed the recipe entirely. I am therefore giving this a 5-star rating as I am sure it would have been just as delicious and easy if i would not have made these small changes.

This is a great recipe. The icing isn't too sweet and really has that cream cheese taste.  The only downside I've found is that the icing is somewhat too runny to ice a two layer cake.  It drips down the side and doesn't stay in place.  I try to refrigerate the icing for at least 2 hours before icing a cake, to avoid this problem.

This is truly a wonderful cream cheese frosting. It's simple and creamy with a real cream cheese taste. I have made it twice, once with regular and once with reduced fat cream cheese. The reduced fat changes the consistency only slightly, but not enough to make a big difference unless you're tasting it straight out of the bowl. Food coloring is a fun addition, too!

Excellent!! Nice Consistency, Tastes Wonderful, who could ask for more? I made it for my 80 year old Father on Father's Day and he absolutely loved it, and believe me, he is fussy about frosting. He will not eat canned frosting. Thanks for the terrific recipe!!!

This is another good cream cheese frosting that I liked and would suggest in addition to Tom Parkers 'Whipped cream frosting'. This frosting turnes out pretty nice and not too sweet but light and delicious. It was the icing on my sons 4th B'day cake!

My husband loved this frosting.  And he is hard to please.  It really does retain the cream cheese flavor but it is softened a bit by the sugar and vanilla.  I love beat it until it was a whipped consistency.  This has definitely replaced my last recipe.

I used 3/4c fine castor sugar instead because i didn't have icing sugar and it turned out fantastic! I just had to beat the mixture a little longer until the texture becomes smooth.The sweetness was juts nice for me.

Superb icing!  My favorite now!  I used it to dress up these near failures of cookies and it is amazing!  Will use this again and again, I guarantee!  Also, it transfers to smaller batches very well.  I only used 1/2 package cream cheese and the rest was scaled to that size and it came out great!

This recipe tasted just like a cheesecake.  I'm rating it 3 stars because it wasn't the flavor I was looking for in a cream cheese frosting.  Obviously many reviewers just love this but for me the cheesy flavor was overwhelming even after the addition of more sugar.  Just a matter of personal preference.

This is a great icing recipe.  If you are decorating a cake or cupcakes you might want to add more powdered sugar so the icing will hold up.

Very good frosting. This was not too sweet as many other recipes are and with a little bit of cocoa it was perfect. I used two more tablespoons of butter than the recipe called for and it was so creamy and delicious.

I made this frosting, adding the extra sugar and cocoa powder as suggested in previous comments, and it turned out wonderful!  I made a double layer, 13x9 inch cake, and there was none left at the end of the party.  Everyone said it was the best cake they'd ever had.

I was nominated to make a cake for a co-workers birthday, after much research, I chose a carrot cake with this frosting. It was a hit!! Perfect texture and taste. It was not "sicky" sweet like some frostings. I will use it again.

This frosting was a hit! The amount was perfect for the chocolate layer cake I made. I used the suggestion of adding an additional cup of powdered sugar, as well as some extra vanilla. Also, I added some cocoa powder to a small amount of the frosting to use as the filling for the cake. I brought it to work for a coworker's birthday and everyone loved it!

Excellent!  I too added extra sugar to make it a bit sweeter (thin with 1-2 tsp of milk if it gets too thick).  This makes A LOT of frosting.  I halved it and it still frosted an entire cake-mix sized batch of cupcakes.

This recipe is simple and very very tasty!  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 quantity...I prefer the cream cheese to be more prominant than the sugar.

I really liked this recipe, the only change i made was to use 1/3 less fat cream cheese b/c that was all I had on hand. But this icing was perfect for my strawberry cake and it was yummy!

I am just learning to bake and I made some home made cinnammon rolls and quickly jumped onto All Recipes to find an icing recipe for the top. This was the first one I saw and it was perfect. I had all of the stuff, it was very easy and quick and the taste was perfect. Not too sweet! It complimented the cinnamon and sugar perfectly! I loved it, the whole family loved it more than the rolls themselves!

My family and myself thought this was the best cream cheese frosting ever.  I read other ratings and I did one change.  I added an extra cup of sugar and then I placed it in the refrigerator for about 10 min to thicken up the frosting.  My family says Thank-you

This frosting is wonderful!!! It is really easy to make and turned out delicious.  I used it on a red velvet cake and there was not a bite left.  It really does take like a cheesecake.  I'm putting it on a lemon cake tonight, actually the Luscious Lemon Cake from this site, I hope it tastes as good as I think it will.

Awesome frosting! I was a little disappointed at the amount it made though. Another review said it was alot but I had to use sparingly. Next time I'll double it since we like thick frosting.

This is the perfect cream cheese frosting for cakes, bars, cookies, etc. I made it to along with Carrot Cake III from this site and everyone raved! I did increase the sugar to 3 cups for a little more sweetness.

Delicious! The other ingredients enhance the cream cheese flavor instead of drowning it out with sugar like some of the other recipes.  Don't change anything!

Amazing.  I cut back a little bit on the sugar and used half light and half fat free cream cheese and it turned out really good.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Very Tasty and so easy.  I wasn't sure if it would be enough to frost my 2 layer cake though so I stretched it a bit by adding a big more butter and powdered sugar.  I enjoyed the taste the most however, as it was written.

I used this recipe to frost my husband's favourite carrot cake for his birthday. (the "Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting" here) He doesn't like overly-sweet frosting so I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the vanilla to just about 1 1/4 tsp. Someone here said that this recipe is for someone who loves real cream cheese taste...she's right.  It's a little too heavy and cream cheesy for my tastes, but I did make it for my hubby and he absolutely LOVED it.

It's simple and delicious. I used the frosting as a topping to "Black Bottom Cupcakes I" also on this site, which is a major cream cheese fix.

I have used this recipe many times, it is the best cream cheese frosting I have used. But, today I need more and thicker so I tweaked it a bit. I combined it with another recipe and used a box of powdered sugar and 2 tsp. of vanilla. It was perfect for piping on cupcakes.

I made this to go on a carrot cake.  When I first mixed it, I thought it was going to be a little sweet but after it chilled and was on the cake, it was just perfect.  Like other reviewers, I found I had leftovers but I didn't free any - it was just too good to leave, so I ate it straight from the bowl!  Yummy!

I made this frosting today to ice a 2-layer strawberry cake. It turned out a little more firm than I would like, especially to ice a layer cake with. At the end I popped the last bit in the microwave for about 5 seconds so that I could make the top of the cake smooth. I also added a 3rd cup of confectioners sugar and I thought it made the icing a little too sweet, especially for strawberry cake. If I were to make this again I'd probably add a teaspoon of lemon juice and stick to the 2 cups of sugar.

This was a good cream cheese frosting.  It was very rich though.  I added cocoa powder to mine to give it a chocolate flavor and used it to frost a chocolate cake.  I might have liked a slightly lighter frosting with a little sweeter, less "cream-cheesy" flavor.

I loved this cream cheese. I used to make brownies all the time and when i was hungry for some cool cream cheese tatse I just added cream cheese on top (to my single brownie of course). I'm so glad I found this recipe and the Best Brownies recipe. They paired amazingly together. For the best brownies recipe I scaled this recipe to 16 servings and even then only used 1 package of creamcheese and 1 cup of cup of 10x sugar. It was amazing and my family just wanted to eat the frosting, and lick the spoon and bowl.

Super easy and tasty.  I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted with almond and it was really good.  Also, I only used 3/4 cup sugar and that was plenty for me.  Too bad the lemon cake wasn't that great. I Will definitely make this frosting again.  Thanks.

Amazing.  Even with my changes (8-oz. reduced fat, 8-oz. fat free cream cheese, 3/4 stick of reduced-fat butter) it was incredible.  I used a dash more vanilla as well as almost 1 tsp. of allspice mixed in.  My full-fat loving boyfriend loved it - it really did taste cream cheesy and delicious.  If you like it a bit sweeter, I would add more than the 2 cups in the recipe - this recipe is very rich but not overly sweet.  This paired great with the Lite Carrot Cake on this site!

Pretty tasty! Though I had to add a little extra powdered sugar as it was a little too cream cheesey. Won't be buying the canned stuff anymore, though!

BEST FROSTING EVER!  Anyone who says differently either made it incorrectly in some way or just doesn't appreciate what a true cream cheese frosting should taste like.

Easy and delicious.  I don't like typically sweet frostings, so this is a great recipe for me.  It's light enough and not too sweet. I tend to add a little more vanilla than it calls for, but the cream cheese can handle it.

The best Cream Cheese Frosting EVER! I was a little skeptical of this recipe because of previous reviewers but halved the recipe and followed it exactly and it turned out perfectly. IT went fantastically with pumpkin muffins...my only advice is to make sure butter and cream cheese are at room temperature before making.

I loved this recipe.  I enjoy the cheesecake taste more than a sweet taste.  I however changed a few things.

Instead of Vanilla extract I used Almond extract.
1/4 cup Amaretto Liqueur (I used Disaronno, if you have it, its great)
1/4 cup Orange juice, or Lemon juice.  Lemon curd might be good as well.

I used this on a Carrot cake, but I am sure it would be great on other things as well.

This is THE BEST frosting I've ever tasted, let alone made myself! I modified it just a tad by reducing the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup, because 1 1/2 cups of sugar was sweet enough for me. Other than that, the recipe is so easy and comes out perfectly! I used it to frost a vanilla cake that I topped with coconut, and it was delicious.

The taste was good, and that's why it gets 3 stars. But the texture was just awful! It was so runny that no amount of powdered sugar (literally all the sugar I had in the cupboard) or refrigerating (about 5 hours) was enough to fix it. It is realistically more of a glaze than a frosting, and not at all what I wanted. If you're looking for a fluffy frosting, this is definitely not it.

This is incredible. Has just the right amount of sweetness coupled with the cream cheese/cheesecake taste. Love this icing. I halved the recipe for carrot cupcakes. The carrot cake recipe was supposed to be for a 9x13 pan, but i made cupcakes instead. Halved I almost did not have enough and had to take icing from other cupcakes to finish the two or three left.

I used slightly less butter (3/4 stick) because I prefer less oily food. This is the best icing I've ever made. And it covered a bundt cake with plenty to spare.
3/19 I added an extra cup of powdered sugar to thicken it up, decrease the oiliness, and it made more than plenty for a 1/2 sheet cake with some to spare!

I made this frosting with the Pumpkin Cake III for a family reunion at Thanksgiving.  This was the best Cream Cheese frosting I have ever made.  I doubled the recipe, and added a dash of nutmeg and allspice.  It was a BIG HIT!  Will use again at Christmas.

This was perfect, just what I have been looking for.  I don't like the sweetness of the store bought cream cheese frosting.  This was like cheese cake.  Went great with carrot cake.

In halving the recipe for a small batch of cookies, I accidentally forgot to halve the butter - and in the end I was thankful for it! So creamy and delicious - even with fat-free cream cheese, Splenda and margarine. Nobody was the wiser at work when I brought them in!

This recipe is fantastic!!!  Used it on pumpkin cookies and many of the children just licked the frosting off the cookies--it is so good!  It tastes like cheesecake--yummy!!

Added:  Made this yesterday for a strawberry cake.  Added 4 squished strawberries to it for color and strawberry flavor.  YUM!!  Might be my favorite frosting ever.  It did make it slightly runny, but I just put the cake in the freezer until the party and it turned out great!!  I totally love this cream cheese frosting!!!

It was pretty good, very simple, but a little too cream cheese-ey for me. I added a little more vanilla to the mix and powdered sugar, but then it got a little thick and hard to handle so I added about a half a teaspoon or so of milk.

This frosting is awesome and so so easy to make.  It really does taste like cheesecake.  I used it on cupcakes, and it would taste wonderful on anything that you would normally put the store bought cream cheese frosting on, makes it even better.

This came out well. I put 1/2 cup white sugar, and a bit more conf. sugar for a sweeter taste. And added a little banana and blue food coloring for my sons 1st Bday cake.

This frosting was just ok for me.  I put it on a spice cake for my husband's birthday.  They're not lying when they say it's very cheese cakey tasting.  There was just something off about the taste of it...perhaps it's better on a cake that's got a sweeter taste.

I halved this recipe and it was the perfect amount to cover a pumpkin spice cake baked in a 9x13 pan (the cake was left in the pan when frosted).  I added a bit of cinnamon to it too to complement the fall flavors of the cake.  It's easy to make this frosting sweeter, if you need to, but I found it to be a nice balance of cream cheese and sweet (in response to previous reviews).

Wonderful recipe! I added 2-1/2 cups powdered sugar, that was just right. It was so smooth and creamy. I put it into pastry bags and refrigerated it until I was ready to use it so it would be a little easier to pipe onto red velvet cupcakes. I took them to work tonite and they were gone in a flash!

Wonderful!! My daughter loved this recipe.  She kept eating spoonfuls right out of the bowl as I was frosting cinnamon rolls.  Very creamy and not to sweet.  Can't wait to try this frosting on carrot cake. Thanks for the recipe.

Lovely! I used Victoria Island cream cheese (which is by far my favorite cream cheese; tastes less processed than Philadelphia cream cheese, in my opinion), but found it a bit too thick to spread, so I added a bit more vanilla (probably doubled it) and the consistency/taste was good. My cake still crumbled a bit while I was spreading, but once they taste it, who's going to look at it? I filled and topped a double layer chocolate cake (Dark Chocolate Cake, from this site), and added half a can of cherry pie filling on top. Looks fantastic! Tastes good, too. :P This recipe was enough to do one double layered 9" cake and one double layered 6" cake, not being very generous on the icing (I figured I ought to cut down a little with the cherry topping! Didn't want to overdo it). Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my! This is...very good. I have a weekness for good cream cheese frosting. However, it is hard to come by. I have tried many recipes, all too sweet. This is perfect, really perfect. It's simple to make too. A dangerous combination. Definitely let the cream cheese and butter sit out a good while if you have a wimpy hand mixer like mine. Enjoy!

I am so happy to have found a REAL cream cheese frosting recipe...not one that tastes like a mouth full of sugar with a little cream cheese in it.  Compliments the taste of carrot cake rather than overpowering it.

I used the frosting on homemade rolls I guess my batch of rolls was not that big.I thought it was alot plus the frosting tasted better the next day I think it was better blended. The girls at work didn't think it was to much frosting they said they were great!

Excellent frosting - not too sweet, and great texture. I added a little lemon zest because I was putting it on the Lemon Poppy Seed Loaf (from this site), and it was such a hit! Some of our guests ate just the frosting!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe with Carrot Cake III.  Came out wonderfully!  Spreads out quite well if warmed up a few seconds in the microwave.  The only minus is that it tends to have an amateur-ish shiny/greasy appearance, but that's most likely due to the low dry ingredient ratio, but the taste more than makes up for it.

This is good if you like the strong cream cheese taste.  I was hoping it was going to be more sweet than cream cheesy.  But it was good.

Very good. I doubled the butter to make it lighter and a little less cream cheesy.  Yum on top of cinnamon rolls.

This is great if you love REAL cream cheese flavor - I reccomend using this frosting to top off a recipe I found from Betty Crocker for Straberry-Cream Cheese Cupcakes!  The best - just like a mini cheesecake, but very simple!

Sooo gooood! This frosting is really tasty. I used one package lowfat and one full-fat cream cheese and it still turned out real good. It started to get thin, so I took the advice of another reviewer and stuck in the the freezer for a little before I frosted the banana lime cake for my brother's birthday. The extra frosting is delicious on Saltine crackers! :)

It was OK. I prefer my cream cheese frosting on the sweeter side. Next time I will use only 1 pkg. of the cheese and maybe add more sugar.

I used 1/3 fat room temperature cream cheese and the texture of this frosting was fine. Instead of vanilla I used almond and strawberry extracts to frost some strawberry cupcakes and the cream cheese went really well with those flavors.

This was the easiest frosting recipe I have ever made!!  Both my husband and children ask for the fluffy white icing anytime I am going to make a cake or pumpkin roll.  The key to the recipe is making sure that the cream cheese is softened along with the butter, otherwise it will be lumpy.  They always ask to have some leftover, just to lick off of their fingers....

I used this to frost the Frosted Banana Bars from this site.  It was perfect.  I still had about a cup left over after frosting a 9x3 pan.  Now I have to find something to frost so that it doesn't go to waste :)

would be perfect for carrot cake but that's about it. Not very light and fluffy like you expect frosting to be, but good.

I made just like it said and it was great.  It does make enough for 2 cakes.  My husband chooses to eat the leftover frosting by the spoonful! So obviously he loved it.  I used it with Pat's Award Winning Carrot Cake.

This was a pretty good frosting. I used it on "The Best Carrot Cake Ever" and it turned out well. I live in the Czech Republic and don't have access to cream cheese, so I bought "tvaroh" and it was so similiar that it tasted pretty much the same. Make sure that the butter is very soft before you mix! My frosting had a few small bits of solid butter, which made the icing layer at the top look a little flawed.

This was good!  I added a little pumpkin pie spice to it and spread it on pumpkin bread. It didn't get hard or crusty, and was a bit messy with the plastic wrap.  It sure was tasty though!  Will make again, with pumpkin bread!

Wow!  This is so nice and creamy and has just enough tang.  I mixed it for about 3 minutes to get it nice and smooth and it was just perfect.  I used this to top a Baby Food Cake Bars recipe and it was just the right amount.

This frosting was great. It was nice and creamy without that gritty texture. Not too sweet either, just right. I used it to frost Banana Cake X from this recipe site.  Very good.

Truly wonderful frosting! This was the first recipe I've used from allrecipes, and it was wonderful. I read the reviews and after that, made a half batch with the written amount of sugar and a half batch with a doubled amount of sugar. Bot h were in between for me, so I added one more cup of sugar, and it was perfect with the red velvet cake I made. Mmm!

Just don't taste it while you're making it, there won't be enough left to frost the cake!!!  Delicious.  I tripled the recipe and put this on Sam's Famous Carrot Cake, WOW!  It is cream-cheesy, but that's what's so great about this recipe.  I was worried about consitency after reading some of the other reviews, my came out super creamy and looked gorgeous on the cake!  Thank you :-)

I just made this and spread it over a carrot cake.  To me it was perfect.  I made sure the butter and cream cheese were at room temperature and used my mixer and in a few minutes I had perfect cream cheese frosting.  I don't know how it could be better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just what I was looking for to frost my carrot cake with!  I wanted a frosting that definitely tasted like cream cheese and not just sugar - this is the perfect balance of cream cheese taste and sweetness!  I used The Best Carrot Cake Ever recipe from this site and it was a total hit!

PERFECT!! Absolutely delicious! I used 1 package of regular cream cheese and a package of 1/3 less fat, sooo good! Next time I will try it with 2 packages of lower fat cream cheese. Either way it's awesome!

Outstanding.  Excellent on carrot cake, and I'm sure it would be great on many other cakes, cookies, etc.  I used a high grade vanilla extract, and I think that makes a difference in flavor.

I made the "moist carrot cake" from this site and wanted to frost it and I'm glad that I came across this recipe. It was a perfect finish to my carrot cake. I did cut the recipe down a bit and still had some leftover. Thanks for sharing!!

I used this on pumpkin cupcakes and added some cinnamon to it.  It was a big hit...I actually like that it's not as sweet as most other frostings, too

This recipe is soooo easy.  I was looking for a cream cheese coffee frosting, but couldn't find one that I liked, so I used this one as is, and then added about 1/2 Tbsp. (enough for one cup of coffee) instant coffee disolved in one Tbsp. hot water.  This turned out awesome!!!  I also tried it before I added the coffee and will definitly be using this again, as both plain cream cheese and as coffee cream cheese frosting!  Great recipe!!!!!!

MMMM, this is great frosting!  Really good on carrot cake.  I didn't have enough cream chees, so I used a bit more butter and then added a touch of milk.  I wish I had enough though, it would have been even better.  Great stuff.

I was surprised at how easy frosting is to make! I felt that this recipe tasted a it too strongly of cream cheese. I think I was looking for something in between a cream cheese and a butter cream recipe which is more like what you can find in the store. I wanted to make it chocolate cream cheese frosting so I substituted a bit of the powdered sugar with hot cocoa mix. That worked exactly as I thought it would. In anycase, after seeinghow easily frosting can be made at home, I'll never buy at the store again!

I really liked the flavor of this icing with pumpkin cake, but it was way too thin.  After adding nearly a cup of powdered sugar, it was still thin, but tasty.

Only had enough cream cheese to do half a batch, which is a darn shame, because I don't think there will be any left for the cookies when they are done!

This was delicious, my husband raved about it. To make it interesting, I added about 3-4 tbsp of Bailey's Irish creme liquer. (This is especially nice for a St. Patrick's day cake). 
The only thing that slightly disappointed me is that it was very soft, and it made it pretty difficult to ice the cake. I had intended to pipe a border on the cake for a little decoration, but it was way too soft to pipe.  My cake was completely cooled, so it wasn't the cake, but the house WAS warm. I put the icing into the freezer for about 20 minutes and it still didn't make a difference. Anyway, once I got it on the cake and into the frig, it hardened up.  But don't try to pipe this stuff, it seems to melt way too fast when exposed to any kind of warmth.

This was delicious on carrot cake!  I added a bit more vanilla and Neufchatel cheese, and it mixed beautifully in my Kitchenaid mixer.  It was tangy, yet sweet and vanilla-y.  Thank you for a good, basic cream cheese frosting!  Be sure to use only unsalted butter!
****For the poster above me:  this will stiffen up in the refrigerator.

Whenever I make the recipe for "Best Carrot Cake Ever" found an all-recipes, it is simply a no-brainer to make this frosting to go in the middle and to surround the outside. I love the flavor and texture of this frosting. I am going to try to make a chocolate version and I will post my success or failure!

This is such delicious frosting. Not too sweet and very rich. I replaced one cup of icing sugar with a cup of store bought caramel dip (the kind you find next to apples in the grocery store) and frosted a banana cake with it.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great frosting.  I halved the recipe because I did not need that much for what I was making and whipped it in my mixer.  It is not a real sweet frosting and the whole family loved.  Thanks.  Made with Tomato Soup Cake I from this site.

Excellent for the autumn veggie-bakes: carrot cake, pumpkin bread, sweet potato muffins, pumpkin cookies, etc. It's very cream-cheesy, not so much like a sweet-cream frosting, which is exactly how we wanted it. Thanks!

so. good. 

Mine was a bit too runny to spread, i think it's because i mixed it for too long. I popped it into the fridge and the consistency was perfect! I used this on my carrot cake, and decorated the cake further by microwaving dark chocolate and piping designs like flowers. The dark chocolate works really well with the cake and frosting.

Perfect amount of sugar---tastes like a cheescake batter--If you are looking for syrupy sweet frosting---this is not it.  Great consistency for filling or frosting--I would double the recipe if you need to crumb coat.

Very easy.  I halved the recipe for a single layered banana cake and substituted lemon juice for the vanilla, you could use lemon essence. Fantastic, presents very well and spreads easily.

Pretty good, a little to cream cheesy maybe ... can't quite put my finger on it, but it was good.

I was led here by reviews on a carrot cake recipe I was making that said to switch the frosting for this one.  So glad I did!!!  I made this exactly as published and it was WONDERFUL!  I like cream cheese frosting to actually have some of the cream cheese taste to it...and this recipe does...not overly sweet and a perfect creamy consistency.  This is a keeper.

Easy and yummy.
Made homemade "yeast" cinnamon rolls as gifts.
Got more compliments on this frosting than the rolls!

I don't even like cream cheese frosting, but I was in charge of making carrot cake for an anniversary party.  I decided to make this recipe, and I had to taste it.  I surprised myself, it's excellent.  I added at least a cup more of the sugar so it wasn't quite so tart.  I had no issues with the frosting being runny, but I didn't let the cream cheese/butter sit too long.  It probably wasn't quite room temp yet.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and the consistency is just right.

I had a recipe for cream cheese frosting that had asked for 4-41/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I thought that sounded like too much.  I found this recipe and it was PERFECT for my red velvet cake!  I printed this one off!  Thanks!

Prepared exactly as written, only substituting "I can't believe it's not butter" for the butter. It was fabulous with carrot cake! Thank you Janni!

I was making this frosting very late at night and accidentaly used 2 sticks of butter rather than one. I added an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to compensate and it turned out perfect! People who don't like cream cheese frosting loved this one because it lacked the overpowering cream cheese taste. Great recipe

Tasted alright but a bit sweet. Problem: it was more like a soup than a frosting. I will use it to glaze my carrot cake but there is no way it will go on the sides without dripping. A bit dissapointing in the consistency.

I used this for The Best Carrot Cake Ever.  Turned out really good.  Be sure to let your cake cool COMPLETELY before frosting.  This frosting tends to melt down pretty fast.  I cooled my cake overnight and still had a little problem, but this was a good frosting.  Could have been my fault or humidity.

I made it for the "Best Carrot Cake Ever" recipe on this site and I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake OR cream cheese frosting (my husband and coworkers are), but even I liked the cake - with the frosting being my favorite part. I did add about a quarter cup more powdered sugar to take some of the bite out of it, but the texture was fine even before I did that. Definately not a runny frosting, though I wish I had a 220v compliant mixer to have fluffed it up more than I managed to by hand. One of the hazards of moving overseas, I guess.

This recipe produces a frosting which indeed has a lovely cream cheese flavor - not overly sweet, which complemented the brownie recipe I used it on very well.  however, I am only giving it three stars because of the texture - it is way too thin for my taste - more like a loose icing (which is fine for certain recipes) than a thick, rich frosting.  I read one review that said this consistency may be a result of using margerine - however I used butter and got the same thin consistency.  The only only other substitution I made was to use orange extract instead of vanilla.  I think I will keep looking for that perfect cream cheese recipe.

This frosting was SO good! I used it on an A#1 banana cake from this website and it was perfect. It is not overly sweet which lets the cream cheese shine. Thank you JANNI!

I used this to frost a carrot cake that I made ("Lite Carrot Cake", found on this site) during the holidays. Kind of defeats the purpose of a "lite" cake, but nevertheless, this frosting was excellent. :)

Taste? delicious.  It makes a lot, so judge the quantity carefully.  We used it on Hummingbird Cake.  That's a great cake recipe.

Wow wow wow! I loved this one! I didn't have to thin it with milk or anything at all, it was perfect! 

Only thing different I did was short the sugar about 1/4 of a cup. I would add sugar slowly as recommended by others to get the sweetness that suits you.

I shortened this recipe to half and it was more than enough to frost a 9x13 cake.  We put it on Carrot Cake XI, also found on this site, and it was to die for.  The frosting has a really great flavor but is a little runnier than I'm accustomed to so I added more sugar until I was satisfied with the cosistancy.  This is a keeper because it is simple to make and tastes great.
