very simple and very good.  Is is a five star???  I have a hard time with giving it that high just simply because I look at those recipes as something special..which this was really not.  I will probably make it again but I really do not think it was a recipe anyone is going to beg for.  Nice side dish and that was it.  Simple..which was nice.  3 stars seems about right for that!

This was easy and quite good. I added a tablespoon of chopped chives just because I have so much and that added a little more color and zip. Next time I am going to try some fresh tarragon.

Adults in the house liked, kids gave it a so-so rating.  Used white onions because that's what I had on hand and added in some green peppers.  Will be making this again in the future.
