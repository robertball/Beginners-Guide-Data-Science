This is wonderful. I used a whole chicken to test it on before thanksgiving turkey.... the meat has a very nice flavor and is very moist. I also used the juices from the pan to make a gravy. The flavors really showed through in this as well. My entire family and even my guests loved this one !!! YUMMY  !!!  :)

My job is to make the turkey for all holiday functions in this family. I always try a new recipe and they LOVED this one. I added garlic, rosemary, celery seed, and parsley to the veggies and rubbed the skin with the same mixed with olive oil. Fantastic.

I especially like recipes the old-fashioned way-without chemically altered ingredients and plastic bags. As an old-fashioned organic cook, I can taste the difference right away. I used this recipe with chicken so had to adjust the amounts.   It was so good that I've decided to use this recipe on the Thanksgiving turkey.  GO NAVY!

I just loved this.  I did not use a whole turkey however, but as it is the New Year, I am trying to make healthier food.  This fit the bill for a turkey breast.  I followed the recipe exactly except for putting the salt and pepper directly on the turkey breast.  Turned out very moist and flavorful.  I will save the veggies and juice for a soup.  Thank you so much for posting.

Loved it! I did add fresh tomato to the veggies...they were as big a hit as the turkey. The juices made an amazing gravy.

Loved it.  Although, it was a bit much wine/liquid for the gravy.  Next time I'll try about 3 cups wine instead of the whole bottle.  Recipe is a keeper for sure!

Made it this Thanksgiving.  Followed recipe exactly and it came together perfectly.  Served with Quinoa dressing recipe and the calories were greatly reduced with great tasting and satisfying food.

This was my first ever Thanksgiving Turkey and it was simple and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to wrap the turkey in foil. It got a darker brown, but that was right for my taste. I also rubbed the turkey with olive oil and the spices that were left in the mixing bowl after the carrots, celery, and onion were stuffed in and around the turkey. Also, instead of bay leaves, I substituted 3 Tbsp of Rosemary. Wonderful recipe!

My husband followed this recipe when we hosted Thanksgiving last year and everyone raved.  This recipe is very healthy yet flavorful.  We (he) will be doing this one again this year.

Being former U.S. Navy, and stationed in Japan for 2 years, I felt that I had to try this recipe. My Japanese National friends were impressed.
The meat was tender and moist.
