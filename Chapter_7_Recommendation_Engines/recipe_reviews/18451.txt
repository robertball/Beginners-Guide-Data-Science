This recipe was a bomb until it was "doctored" up a bit. It needs some zest such as using Miracle Whip & Mayo combined for flavor, which is was lacking.  Thank goodness potato's are cheap. I also added more salt, pepper &  some pimento as well as celery.

fantastic potato salad ... I was worried when some people said the cider vinegar was too much ... but I found it to be perfect ... didn't add eggs ... put 2 chopped ribs of celery and a chopped bunch of green onions in ... added 1/3 cup diced cilantro and 6 slices of crumbled bacon ... this is a keeper!

If you like tangy potato salad, this one is for you.  This is a classic potato salad.  Be sure to add a little diced dill pickle for extra crunch and taste.  Sprinkle paprika on top, too.

I've tried making potato salad before, but nothing great. This was absolutely fantastic. I used a tablespoon of Nathan's mustard instead of dry as I didn't have dry on hand. The ultimate compliment was  from my Jewish Mother in Law who said it was the best she'd ever tasted and reminded her of what she'd had growing up.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I purposly make more than I think I need for a party so I will have leftovers.  It is a creamy, true potato salad without having a bunch of nonsense ingredients mixed in and skewing the flavor and texture.  Gets compliments every time.

Reduce the vinegar or pucker up! I would reduce by half maybe less than that.. my whole family complimented the recipe but said way too much vinegar.

Excellent!  Tastes just like a deviled egg potato salad.  Make sure you let it chill overnight for best results.  Made this all last summer and we never tired of it....great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I ran my onion through the food processor before adding it to the potato salad ingredients. I did not add the full amount of salt, just enough to taste. I did add some of the family's personal potato salad ingredients (chopped pickles, hot sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, chives) but other than that I stayed true to the recipe. It looked like potato salad should but it wasn't a hit with my family. My husband thought it was too creamy and too sweet. My oldest boy was polite but I could tell he didn't care for it. My youngest wouldn't eat past the first bite. I'm sorry, this wasn't for us.

I myself prefer tangy potato salads to sweet ones. Sounds a lot like one I make except I use deli mustard and add lots of dill pickles. I never add sugar or miracle whip which in my opinion is just nasty anyway.

First of all, this is NOT your everyday potato salad.  It's very rich, very creamy.  I make this a couple times a year when I want to be BAD!  The only changes I make are; I don't use any heavy cream and I use tarragon vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  Also, I add chopped celery. Then I garnish it with halved cherry tomatoes.

I made a few alterations to this recipe.  I used light Miracle Whip in place of the mayo/sour cream/heavy cream to cut some fat and added some extra hard-boiled eggs (mostly the whites).  I also left out the onion, but sprinkled in a little onion powder to get the flavor.  The only complaint from my guests was that it wasn't mustardy enough.  I will make this again with the above alterations (and a little more mustard).

I certainly disagree with the reviews that said it had to much vinegar. This is one of the best potato salads I've ever had and I didn't change a thing from the origonal recipe. I used fresh apple cider vinegar and quite frankly, I could barely taste it so it sure wasn't over powering. This will be a regular in my house from now on.

I do not usually add comments but I feel I must in this case.  To halfcup - southern cooks ALWAYS peel/dice potatoes before they are cooked and I do not see this recipe listed as the ultimate recipe for a holiday. Someone has a recipe to share and they share it.  If you do not like it just say so giving the reasons.  That is all that is needed in a recipe review.

We liked it! I did reduce the vinegar to about half the amount, but otherwise followed the recipe as written, and it turned out nicely.

I made this potato salad last weekend for a family gathering and it was a huge hit.  I had never thought to marinate the potatoes before but it really adds a great dimension to them.  I followed some of the suggestions other reviewers had and halved the vinegar and added a touch more mustard.  I also added some sweet dill to balance out the vinegar.   I used white vinegar and regular mustard since I didn't have cider vinegar or dry mustard on hand.  My family doesn't like raw onions so I replaced that with onion powder.  The longer you chill the dish before serving, the more the vinegar flavor mellows.  This is a great basic recipe to add some custom touches to!

Outstanding recipe! This was the first time I ever tried to make potato salad and talk about a HIT! EVERYONE loved it. I made enough for 12 people and it was the only thing that was gone within the first hour! I got rave reviews. Thanks for the GREAT recipe! EDIT (07/04/08): Once again, this potato salad recipe was the hit of the bar-b-que. I actually had people offer to BUY the recipe from me. When I told them that this recipe has gotten some 1-star reviews, everyone agreed that the person must have made it wrong because this was the best potato salad recipe ever. All thirty-five people at my party said so. So I say, give it a try!

This was VERY strong in the vinegar department....almost tasted like it had been around too long.  I had wanted something different and it was, but not in a good way.  I will go back to my same old same old recipe.

Made this healthier in a few ways. I used light Miracle Whip instead of mayo, used light sour cream, and used 2% milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and it seemed to turn our great! But, this recipe definitely NEEDS MORE MUSTARD for sure. I added at least a 1/8 cup regular mustard, possibly more to taste. We didn't add eggs since we don't love them, but added some pickles for crunch and green onions instead of white. Really great!

I fixed this last weekend on July 4th.  Awesome.  The best potato salad I have ever had.  The only complaint my husband had was that it had no color.  I may add paprika or something on the top just for color.  Otherwise, this is perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way, this was the first time I have ever made potato salad and there is no need to look for another recipe.

This recipe is exceptional! Everyone thought I bought this well flavored potato salad from a deli. I followed the recipe as is with the exception of adding some diced celery for crunch. I use a grater to grate the onion which makes it very fine so that it incorporates well and evenly. It stays creamy and didn't soak up or get runny overnight.  For optimal flavor chill overnight.

I will definitely make this again.  It's great because I don't like mayonaise.  It's creamy, but not mayonaise creamy.  I did add a little garlic powder and cajun seasoning to make it a little more tasteful.

I searched for years to find a recipe that was like the potato salad from my favorite deli in NY. Wow this is as close as it gets. I marinated the onions in the vinegar mixture while the potatoes cooked-I like what it did for the flavor. I also mixed in the dry mustard with the sour cream/mayo mixture. My potatoes marinated for 4 hours instead of 3o minutes but still came out WONDERFUL! So creamy with just the right tangy flavor-reminiscent of a great deli!! Oh - I omitted the eggs-doesn't need it.

I love potato salad, but had never made it before.  This one was wonderful.  My husband (who only eats German potato salad) at most of it.  Now everytime we have to bring a side dish, he askes me to make it.  So there will be 4th of July Potato Salad at Thanksgiving this year.

Befitting its title, I made this salad today, July 4th.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more!  The creamy mixture of the sour cream, mayo, and cream is especially luscious.  Also, marinating the potatoes in the vinegar beforehand is a great idea because it allows the salad to take on multi-dimensional flavor.  The only thing I changed was that I used a mixture of white vinegar and red wine vinegar; using these, I felt that the 1/3 cup specified was a good amount-- not too vinegary as others noted.  I added a little bit of prepared dijon mustard, in addition to the dry mustard, to the vinegar mixture. I also added about a cup of chopped celery.  This will be my basic potato salad from now on!

love this one too. I used reg. yellow mustard instead of dry. I adjusted the amount to taste. I reduced the vinegar and added a bit more sour cream. took another's advice below and sprinkled it with paperika for color. I think next time i will try even less vinegar and add a Tbsp. of sweet pickle or dill pickle relish. mmmmmmmm getting hungry now thinkin about it!....ty!

I've tried a few potato salad recipes from this site; this one is my favorite.  It's creamy, but also tangy.  Also, it's beautiful, especially if you make it with red potatoes and keep the skins on.

This is what potato salad is supposed to taste like.  The vinegar bath gives the little tang that potato salad needs.  I make it a day ahead to let the flavors blend.

I think this is a good recipe: I thought I had cedar vinegar but I was mistaken, so balsamic vinegar it had to be... less than stated, as it's very strong and flavourful. The salad was good, came ot beautiful, didn't get rave rewiews, though...

Wonderful recipe.  Easy to make.  The only thing I added was right before serving I sprinkled it with Old Bay Seasoning.  This was a huge hit at our cookout this evening!!!!

This is almost like my mom's potato salad and hers can't be beat!  Just forget the real mayo, cream, and sour cream and use Miracle Whip in place of them.  Add some thinly sliced radishes for color and crunch and you'll love this salad!

Not a hit with our gathering.  I think it was the vinegar, sugar, and heavy cream; also the lack of garlic.

This is the first time I've made potatoe salad. I really enjoy this recipe. I changed it some by adding 4 tablespoons of Grey Poupon mustard and few teaspoons of Dill. I omitted adding the cream since I found that with the mayo and sour cream the consistency was what we like ( not thick and not liquid). At first, I didn't like the salad. The vinegar taste in my opinion was to strong. As the salad sat in the fridge the vinegar taste became much more subtle and complimented the salad. Also, you must have alot of time to make this salad. It took me alot longer than what is suggested. There are many steps to this salad..peeling the potatoes, cooking them, marinating the potatoes,cooking the eggs, cutting the onion and mixing all of the creamy mixture. I wish the total time was 50 minutes. It was closer to 2 hours but worth the time in my opinion!

We really liked this recipe. The potatoes soaked up the vinegar, which gave the whole dish a German potato salad essence. The addition of heavy cream was very nice and really enhanced the creaminess of the salad. We don’t care for egg, so I left those out. Added pickles and scallions. I would definitely make this again, although I might go lighter on the vinegar if I’m making it for more than just my family.

This potato salad got a 2 thumbs up from my husband - and that's saying something.  I almost skipped the marinating but am so glad I didn't.  It really added a lot of flavor.  Good recipe & I will make it again!

This is the second time I have made this and each time has been excellent.  The vinegar sauce you pour over the potatoes gives this such a wonderful flavor.  As with anything you cook make it your own and play to your taste buds.  I leave out the heavy cream and add more mayo.  I also add celery.  Also my family loves it as well so it isn't just my opinion.  ;)

Delicious!   I think letting the potatoes sit in vinegar is a key step, allowing them to soak up all that wonderful flavor.

This is a really great potato salad.  I've never made a potato salad with sour cream before and will definitely use this as my recipe going forward.  For me, it was nothing but creamy -- everyone loved it.  I used light cream instead of heavy cream, and I added 8 strips of chopped bacon instead of the eggs.

This was the BEST potato salad that I have had in a LONG time!  I only make "easy" recipes and this was so easy.  It was a hit at my Fourth of July picnic!  I think the apple cider vinegar was the key ingredient that helped make it so yummy!!

Excellent recipe! It has taken the place of my standard potato recipe which I used for years. Everone loved the creamy taste it has.
