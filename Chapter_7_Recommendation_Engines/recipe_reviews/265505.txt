6.16.18  The brown sugar and maple syrup give the oatmeal just enough sweetness, but doesn’t overpower.  Next time I’ll cut back just a bit on the amount of the water, husband thought it was a little runny, but that's just personal taste.  Scaled the recipe to two servings, and this does make a big bowl of oatmeal; in this house, it was more like three servings.  Garnished with some sliced banana and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  This is quick and easy for sure!

This is perfect.  No more instant packets for me.  Our son loves this combination.  Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you! Oatmeal sounded good this morning but I didn't have any packets. This tastes like the package and I was able to use the oats I normally only use in baking.

Upon looking for a way to save money and give my kids a somewhat healthier alternative to the pre-packaged oatmeal, Google led us to this recipe. I'm glad we gave it a try! I was a little skeptical about preparing it with water (since my kids like milk with the packets) but it came out great... and since I have one kid with nut allergies and one kid with egg and dairy allergies, it's nice to add a splash of their appropriate milks after it's done. Another great thing is that it can be dressed up as you like... I make one huge pot of it and the kids can add fruit or nuts (or not) as they please. Great quick and simple recipe! We enjoyed it for sure!

I usually use half oats and half granola with raisins.
