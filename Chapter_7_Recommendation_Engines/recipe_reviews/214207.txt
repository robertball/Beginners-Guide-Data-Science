Great flavor but next time I would make it on the stove so that the sauce will reduce down and become a bit thicker.

I used the rootbeer as it say's in the notes. I used only one 16 0z bottle and there was plenty of sause. My family loved this and has requested it again. Next time I will try cola.

I just tried this recipe and I loved it! Everything was stated perfectly and my pork chops came out divine! I'm passing this recipe down to my girlfriends. Thanks!

I am rating this for the sauce. Pork chops are pork chops, but the sauce is soo good. Whenever I make my own sauce I put Dr. Pepper in it now. The sauce is so sweet but yummy. My boyfriend raved and raved over the sauce and how much he liked it.

This was great.  I plan on using the majority of the ingredients except the pork chops for some other recipes.

I've made this twice now and I'm giving it 4 stars as-is.  When following the recipe as written, the pork chops are tasty but they are a soupy mess.   There is no real sauce, so to speak. The natural juices mingled with the soda/barbecue sauce concoction and watered it down.  

  However, when I made them a second time, I boiled the daylights out of the sauce in a saucepan for about 15-20 minutes (or so - just watch for it to thicken a bit), until it thickened.  I then brushed some onto the chops and reserved the rest to pour on at the dinner table (I stuck it in a gravy boat and let my hubby and the kids pour on to their hearts' desire).   Everyone agreed that doing it this was much better, the chops were more flavorful and the sauce is KILLER!   Thanks for a good starting point.   Will definitely make this again the amended way.   :-)

I only made half the recipe for my hubby and I and we still had plenty of sauce left over. The pork chops came out nice and tender and the sauce is nicely sweet. I just wish I could thicken the sauce a bit because it is so delicious. I want to try this on chicken now!

I made a few changes to this recipe, and the star rating reflects my changes! I also want to add, I made a chicken breast exactly the same way with this recipe, and I preferred the chicken breast to the pork chop!

I did everything in a cast iron skillet.
Seasoned meat with salt and pepper- seared stove- top until light, golden-brown skin. 
Covered the meat with sauce, put in oven, flipped meat half-way through. 

The sauce was too thin, as others commented, So I removed the meat, set aside, and added a bit of corn starch to the sauce over low heat until desired consistency was reached.

I made this with a pork roast in my crock pot. I left out the brown sugar, between the BBQ sauce and the Dr. Pepper this is sweet enough.
I cooked this on low for about 7 hours and it was very tender. I used Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and it added a nice spicey kick to it. Hubby liked it. He had 2 sandwiches and wanted a 3rd! But he loves all BBQ pork sandwiches. I think it turns out just as good (if not better) with just BBQ sauce and no Dr. Pepper, a lot less sweet too. I don't think I will make this again. I couldn't imagine adding the brown sugar to it, no need!!

This is an awesome recipe loved by all!!! The only change I made was to brown in frying pan instead of oven first, then put  chops in dish, poured sauce over the them, covered with tinfoil and baked for 30 min at 350Â°. I also used the thick, bone-in chops from Costco. Will definitely make again. Next time I will try some corn starch mixed in sauce before pouring over chops, I like a thicker sauce.

SO GOOD.  I am definitely making this again.  I made it in the slow cooker and then threw them in the oven to broil (with a little extra BBQ sauce).  Delicious!  Plus, my house smelled amazing all day.
