Very yummy, I've been making it for lunch everyday this week.  I've made a few minor changes for my own taste but all in all I love this wrap!

These wraps are tasty and easy to make.  I did add more hot sauce than the recipe called for, but they were still a little bland.  Maybe some seasoned chicken next time...

These weren't spectacular, but they were okay.  My husband added some taco sauce to his and they tasted much better.

Loved it! My kids even ate it tomatoes and all. I used a roasted chicken from Costco for the chopped chicken and it took about 10 minutes to make. I will definitely be making this again.
