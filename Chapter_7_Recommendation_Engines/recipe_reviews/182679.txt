Followed recipe to a "T", except I didn't add chocolate chips (don't eat candy). Margarine used was made with sweet cream buttermilk. Mixed ingredients as directed. No trouble separating into 10 balls; although dough was soft. Trouble came when picking up balls to roll flat in sugar/cinnamon mixture. Dough was very soft. Unable to roll dough in flat circle 14 inches; more than 9 inches caused dough to separate. Cutting into 8 sections was difficult also. Rolling each section into a crescent was impossible. Out of seer frustration, I kneaded the dough 2-3 times in the s/c mixture hoping to give it some firmness. Didn't work, so I cut long rolled dough into 1-1/2 inch sections with a table knife. Though dough looked like tiny logs separated from one another before baking, this was not the case when I pulled trays from the oven. The dough had run together. If I make the recipe again I will use a different margarine. I wanted so much to give a good review on this recipe, but in all honesty I cannot.

Something must be missing from this recipe. It sounded wonderful, it was very sticky and I couldn't roll it out.
