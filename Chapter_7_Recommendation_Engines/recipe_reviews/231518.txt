I wanted to like this recipe. An actual measurement of mashed sweet potato and shredded zucchini would be much more helpful.  I added approximately one cup of mashed sweet potato (that I had microwaved the day before) and about 1 cup of shredded zucchini.  When the ingredients were all mixed together, the batter was far too thin as compared to other muffins I've made before.  I added about 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats to try to soak up some of the liquid.  I ended up with 12 muffins which stuck to the liners and a small mini loaf.  The texture of the final product is very spongy.  They are very sweet.  I hope that my husband's coworkers who will eat anything will eat these.  Sorry, I won't make these again.

The recipe was very good! I did modify it a bit because the sweet potato & zucchini were not measured, I used about 2 1/4 C Sweet Potato and 1 1/2 C Zucchini and added another cup of Bisquick. Cooking time 25 minutes.
I also used both a muffin tin and silicon cups sprayed with Pam and had no trouble with removing muffins from either!
