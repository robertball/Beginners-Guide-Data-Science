SO easy. I used the frozen cooked shrimp to make it even easier. I thawed them and removed the tails then heated them up in the saute pan with red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, salt, olive oil, garlic and lemon juice. Really good with some veggies and rice.

This was very good. The flavors are balanced and you can even go a little overboard with any of the spices according to taste and not ruin anything. In my case, I added a bit more lemon juice and basil as I like that combination a lot. I made some stir fried veggies on the side and used the same recipe on those meant for the shrimp. Both then went on top of some pasta and it was awesome!

Just a note, this recipe is best when using patially peeled and deveined shrimp, it helps keep the flavor soaked in! Enjoy!

I had a craving for shrimp, lemon and pasta, but didn't want to go the shrimp scampi route tonight.   My boyfriend and I were very pleased with this dish!  I served it over sauteed pasta (olive oil, sea salt & cracked black pepper).  Everything was fabulous, I had to create an account to tell you!!  Thanks!

Fantastic shrimp!  This recipe is a keeper.  I did have to tone the zippiness down a little for us though.  I used only 1 tsp. paprika and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  This was just right.  I also added 1/4 cup dry white wine with the lemon juice.  This made a nice sauce to serve it over pasta.  Fresh basil is a must for this recipe.  Absolutely delicious!

I made this for a cocktail party as an appetizer. I was still working the grill when my wife informed me that all four pounds of shrimp were gone. From what I've heard they were fantastic and I can guarantee you that my guests raved about them. Even my kids asked if I could make it again because they didn't get enough. The only changed that I made was to cook these on the grill and the flavor the char adds made these incredible (so I'm told) Good luck and enjoy! I wish I got to.  I wrote a similar review for Spicy Grilled Shrimp in error... these are the REAL DEAL.

This dish quickly became one our favorite shrimp meals.  My hubby now requests this pretty often. I've tried this with both large and small shrimp and the large shrimp is definitely the way to go.  The smaller shrimp SEVERELY dumbs down the flavor and nobody wants that.  Also, it was a tad too spicy for me (perfect for my husband) so I now use 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and he can pour on as many as he likes on his plate afterwards :).  For shrimp, we also always buy deveined and preferably with tails off for less work and its perfect if you're short on time.  Also, for us, there wasn't enough sauce to really seep into the pasta, so I kept all as is except used 1 pound of shrimp instead of 2 and poured it over 1 pound of pasta (equivalent to doubling the sauce).  Don't be scared with so many seasonings in this...it works beautifully. Delicious, easy and is ready in such a short time it deserves all 5 stars.

fast and easy. I used a lot less lemon juice than the recipe asked for, probably about 4 Tablespoons or so. I also added a lot more salt than I usually use. When the lemon juice is added to the butter and oil it makes a very nice sauce. I served over steamed rice with broccoli and poured the sauce over all. We also ate thai hot chili garlic sauce with it. A very adaptable recipe I'll use again

First, let me say that Hubs’ and my heat tolerance level with spices is “Coward.”  That said, I eliminated the cayenne pepper altogether and we found this “zippy” enough without it.   Besides, I used a nice, smoky paprika (Penzey’s) which gave this all the flavor we needed.  I expected to dislike it, actually, thinking the amount of paprika would be more than we’d prefer, but it was right on.  The basil gave this a nice, clean, fresh finish.  I served this over lobster ravioli, but a rice pilaf or pasta with garlic and olive oil would have been nice too.  Zucchini Provencale, also from this site, completed our meal.

Thank you Rebecca! The seasonings are perfect. I'm sure I will make this many more times. The only prob I had was it says to cook the garlic on high heat. I scorched my first batch of oil and garlic and had to start over. Oops, where was my common sense?!

Fabulously good!  We loved it!  While my husband was eating it he said when are you going to make this again?????  Only thing I did different was add much more garlic and double the sauce to put over rice.  Thanks Rebecca!!  We love hot!

I made just like it said except I used crushed garlic instead, as that's what I had.  Great recipe.  My family who enjoys spicy and thought it was great.  I thought it was a bit spicy, but I'm a sissy.  (For reference,Medium salsa is the best I can do and sometimes that's too hot) This recipe is so very diet friendy that that's why I made it.  Served over brown rice with a nice salad.  This is a keeper that I will come back to again and again.  Thanks Rebecca!

I'm a cheater, but I'm happy so I'll confess. I had just bought Tilapia filets on sale when this recipe showed up in my mailbox. I knew I wouldn't buy shrimp anytime soon, but loved the prep/ease/ingredients in the recipe...so I tried it with th Tilapia. I kept the rest of the recipe exactly the same and WOW! I am so glad I tried it, husband myself and some guests were in love. As a matter of fact, my husband (who hates left-overs) was asking for the next two nights if we had enough left for dinner again...simple recipe, quick to make...definitely stays in my rotation...oh, AND it's healthy! I served it with Jasmine rice one night, over a tossed salad of greens the next.

This was awesome; I used frozen shrimp with just the tails attached; then defrosted the shrimp removed the tails before throwing in the pan.  The lemon flavor was so good; with the 'zippy' flavor of the red pepper.  Quick and easy too.  Served with Brown Rice and veggie.  Will definitely make again. Thanks.

Cooking for a family friend's party, I didn't use all of the suggested red pepper flakes because I wanted the natural flavor of shrimp to come through.  Other than the toneing-down-spiciness aspect, these shrimp had a great texture and a superb indulgence.

I took the advice of the submitter and used the largest shrimp I could find.  Served this to a group of hungry men patiently waiting around a campfire for dinner.  I don't know if it was dinner in the "great outdoors" or if it was just that darn good!  Though I'm inclined to think, it was just that darn good.  Served over Roasted Vegetable Orzo also from AR for the perfect meal.  Thank you for the submission rebeccadk.

This is a great basic recipe for shrimp with lots of flavor!  I just want to make one recommendation, don't ever cook garlic on high heat! It burns fast & easily and doesn't become translucent like onion.  It's best cooked on medium-low heat.  Other than that I followed this recipe exactly!

Easy, Tasty and Impressive. What's not to like?? These were a huge hit at a fund raising dinner I helped out at. These shrimp are great as an appetizer, over rice or pasta.

This was wonderful, and so fast!  Two tsp. paprika sounds like a lot, but it wasn't - gave it a nice 'smoky' flavor.  I used only 2 Tbl. olive oil to reduce the fat, and left off the red pepper flakes (just a personal preference).  This went nicely with cole slaw and jasmine rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really tasty and filling, when added to quinoa. I had to add some garlic salt, as I could taste more "spice" than I could "flavor" (if that makes sense). Used frozen pre-cooked salad shrimp that I heated in a wok in the sauce while the quinoa cooked - a great alternative to ordering out Chinese when I want something spicy!

Very yummy!  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce.  I also added 1/2 C. of white wine (to the original sauce amount).  We happened to have some chopped red & green bell peppers in the fridge so sauteed them and through them into the mix after it was done.  I wilted a bag of baby spinach and served the shrimp mixture over that.  It was a fantastically tasty, quick, easy, extremely healthy, one-pan meal!

This was so yummy! I omitted the paprika because I didn't have any. Oops. I also used garlic powder too. I served it with sautéed zucchini, onion & yellow squash over angel hair pasta. Was even great chilled the next day.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have enough shrimp on hand so I also added chicken which was yummy.  Also, I used dried basil which was good but I'm sure fresh would be much better. I served it all over noodles tossed with a drained can of rotel, since we like spicy. Turned out great!

I thought this was an outstanding recipe! It tasted even better than we had expected. We also added noodles to this and the sauce actually thickened up a little bit and it just  made it that much better. It had an amazing flavor to it! Will definitely make this again! :-)

This is super yummy and easy, I had everything on hand.  I used frozen shrimp that I thawed so it made for quick cooking.

These were very flavorful and a great recipe for the beach.  As a time-saver, it is not necessary to devein and butterfly the shrimp (unless you have an aversion to using them whole in the shell).

Just an idea for those that only have lime juice and cilantro on hand.  I substituted those for the lemon and basil and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and oh my my my!!!  Great alternative to change this already awesome recipe up a bit!

An absolutely perfect recipe! Made this without alterations using frozen large Gulf shrimp we had in the freezer. WOW! Served with brown rice and AussieBear's Tomato and Avocado Salad. What a wonderful, memorable meal!! Thank you so much for sharing your delicious recipe, Rebeccadk!!

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN PAIRED WITH SOWMYA'S CARROT RICE! DELISH!!! THE SUBTLE SWEETNESS OF THE RICE COMPLEMENTED MY SHRIMP NICELY! I ALSO ADDED A TOUCH MORE LEMON JUICE THIS TIME (PERFECT!). SUPERB (which is a great feat considering that every time I cook shrimp, I end up with nothing short of a bland outcome)!!! Having said this, I did feel that the flavors were somewhat unbalanced. My shrimp were super spicy with very little "zip." They were also unbelievably messy to eat! As Rebecca suggested (see her review), I left my shrimp partially peeled. Yes, this helped to lock in a LOT of flavor, but they were a real pain to shell after they were coated in sauce. On the contrary, my hubs thought peeling tableside was a non issue (I guess I'm a whimp lol!). Now, about the missing oomph.... The lemon juice definitely adds a bit of tang. This recipe wouldn't be the same without it, so don't leave it out! NOTE: Keep in mind that Spanish paprika is smoky, whereas the more common Hungarian variety is sweet. There are many types, all with differing heat intensities - so chose wisely! :) A seasoned summer veggie blend, garlic herb rice and French bread (for mopping up the extra sauce!) rounded out our fuss-free meal. This will be a perfect to turn to when I'm in need of an easy and quick weeknight meal. That alone elevates this to star quality, IMHO. Thanks for sharing your recipe, REBECCADK! :-)

This recipe was a hit, my only complaint was that when I tried to do this on high heat, per the directions, all the spices burned before I could even get the shrimp in (Thank goodness!) but was great at a -much- lower temp.  I will say, that based on all the reviews, it might have just been my oven but I felt it was worth mentioning.   I served it on a bed of angel hair, a healthy serving of lightly pan fried vegetables (squash, zucchini, onion and garlic) and a four cheese sauce recipe (found on allrecipes.com) that I added garlic, minced onion and black pepper to.  Very Yummy, make sure not to put too much sauce, because you definitely want to be able to taste that shrimp!

This was delicious! I used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of sliced garlic (I was out of fresh) and I used about 1/2 the lemon juice.  I used tail-on peeled and deveined shrimp, put it in a plastic bag, doused it with olive oil (not a 1/3 cup, much less) and poured the seasonings over.  I mixed it up and let it marinade about 30 minutes.  I cooked it over medium high heat for about 5-6 minutes and it was perfect! I will make this again!

This was SO good!  I used 1 lb. of the large raw shrimp/tail on from Costco.  Super easy to just pull off the tails and they are ready to go.  If you are using 2 lbs. of shrimp, double the sauce.  If you are using 1 lb. it's perfect as is.  We are wimps so I just sprinkled in about a 1/4 tsp. or so of the red pepper flakes and added lots of fresh basil at the end.  The sauce was amazing.  I want to try it with scallops too.  My kids said it was like something you would have at a restaurant and it really is.  Served with ravioli with pesto and asparagus.  Delicious!

Classic example of Keep It Simple.  I too added wine and butter to deglaze and make a little sauce.  But I can see it tossed together then onto the grill!  The Basil and lemon were perfect.  Thanks rebeccadk!

If you are looking for a spicy shrimp...this is it!  I served mine over Fettuccine, added the zest from my lemon, a handful of snowpeas and one rough chopped tomato.  Inspite of all the addtions, the heat from the Red Pepper Flakes was the most pronounced flavor.  If you don't like too much heat, cut that way back.  We do like heat and loved the lip tingling after-glow.  Lovely served with mixed fresh fruit to cool the palette.

SunRun 90 - shrimp, especially the larger ones are usually sold deveined with the tail shell on.  When rinsing under cold water before use they pull off easily.  This recipe suggests cooking with the tail shell on.  Check the photo and you see the shell on the tail.  They again easily pull away for eating.  Delicious, fast recipe very similiar to other posted grilled, marinated shrimp recipes minus tomato sauce

Wonderful healthy and delicious.  I served mine over a wild rice mixture and doubled the sauce.  Hubby was sopping up the drippings with french bread.  Grandkids even enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I have made this several times and it is fabulous!  I used less red pepper flakes as it is very spicy if using the whole amount.  I served it with brown rice.  A very tasty, quick meal.  I love that this site will calculate for the # of servings, as I have made this for 6 people and only 2.

This is one of our FAVORITE ways to eat shrimp.  Even my kids devour it!  My middle son doesn't like spice but he still gobbles this down.  Dried basil works too.  Thanks! *EDIT* Serve this over Creamy Four Cheese rice by Rice A Roni.  AAAMAZING!

LOVE IT! You can use less heat for your preference. I've used dried basil when I didn't have fresh, fresh of course tastes better but still good!

The hardest part about this recipe is cleaning the shrimp.  Easy and delicious - perfect for a summer meal.  I used wild caught shrimp and smoked paprika.

This was a real hit with hubby and young sons! Next time I will use less oil and a tad less red pepper as it was perfect for us adults but a little too spicy for the toddler. Thanks for sharing!

Very good! Definitely "Zippy". A bit too much paprika/pepper taste for me, hence the 4 stars. Next time, less of those two and more basil. Thanks for a good one! :)

Yummy yum yum! I almost never write reviews because I often change recipes to suite my tastes but this one deserves 5 stars all the way. I did as another reviewer did - I added a 1/4 cup of white wine and toned down the spice just a tad. Served over steamed broccoli, green beans and rice. It was fantastic! However, I can tell that the recipe stated as is, without any changes would be equally delicious. Give this one a try, you won't be disapointed! Thanks Rebeccadk!

Wonderful! I had a few shrimp I had thawed out and decided not to cook the same day, so had to cook soon after and found this recipe. Reduced it to the portion size I needed and it was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly but did use raw shrimp, we live in La., so fresh shrimp is a must! Thanks for a great easy recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. I followed the recommendations of many others and doubled the sauce. I also add diced onions when I saute the garlic and we use shrimp without the shells or tails. This shrimp dish goes great over couscous.

Delicious!  I added a little soy sauce and it was really good. We had it with some whole wheat rotini noodles.  Definitely would make it again.

Served this over orzo pasta.  Did not put in the red pepper as hubby does not like spicy food.  Even so, it did have a little kick.  I didn't have fresh basil so I soaked dried basil in the lemon juice before adding.  Maybe I'd give a 5 star with fresh basil but all in all it was very good.  Next time I'll try the fresh basil.  Would probably be good other fresh herbs as well.  Oh -added about 2T. wine with the lemon juice.

Very quick, easy and flavorful.  I used Spanish calliente paprika along with the pepper flakes and it was perfect spiciness for my husband and I but I know if I prepare it for others, I will have to tone it down.  My basil grows next to my parsley so I threw an equal amount of it into the dish that I think added to the flavor.  I also peeled my ship and boiled the heads and shells to get some stock.  I added a little of the stock to the dish to stretch the sauce and served it over quinoa.

Very easy and quick to cook. I substituted one small red pepper instead of red pepper flakes and they were a tad too spicy for me. The flavor is great, but it's not fantastic. Maybe I'll try it a couple of more times and see how it could be made better

I'm not sure the flavors came together...they tasted a bit too lemony to me. But they were super spicy! My tongue was tingling! I served them with quinoa.

Can't count the number of times my husband told me how good this was.  It was spicy enough to suit him, but not too hot for me to enjoy as well.  I used the full amount of spices and it was perfect.  It goes together very quickly too.  Will definitely be one of our regulars!

I made this with several changes.  I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp, the paprika to 1/2 tsp and the lemon juice to 2 tbsp.  I also added 3/4 cup of white wine.  I cooked the garlic in the olive oil for a few minutues then added the prawns and cooked until they were pink.  I them removed the prawns from the pan and placed in a covererd bowl.  I then added the lemon juice, red pepper flakes, paprika and wine to the pan, brought to a boil and reduced by about half (took about 5-7 minutes).  After reduction I added the prawns back to the pan along with the basil.  I cooked for a few minutes until the prawns were heated through.  I then tossed the prawn mixture in the pan with cooked pasta, poured a little olive oil over top and tossed again.  I served this with grated parmesan cheese.  The  whole family liked it prepared this way.

Great recipe, very simple, packs in a great deal of flavor.  I used less red pepper in the preparation and added it at the table to taste.  I served this over pasta.

I cooked this dish exactly as written, except for adding a little more basil.  Very, very good recipe.  Even though I had AR reduce the servings to half, it was easy to follow.  Thanks so much for the post.

Quick, easy, awesome! The only thing I did different was use smoked paprika and a box of grape tomatoes-cooked them with a little olive oil and fresh basil til they burst, smashed them and added to shrimp.

This was wonderful. Quite a bite to it, but my husband I both really liked it. I served over tri-colored pasta spirals with steamed broccoli on the side. Another review suggested Thai Chile Sauce on as a condiment.  We loved the sweet with the zip. Definitely a keeper.

This is spicier than I was expecting, but still very good.  I've been looking for a shrimp recipe to try and I'm definitely glad I tried this one.  I will definitely make again... maybe cutting back the red pepper flakes to half of what it calls for.  My first time cooking raw shrimp & I think it was quite successful.  :)

This was delicious! Served it with orzo and it worked really well.  Next time I might wilt in some spinach at the end to add a vegetable and some more body to the dish. Def. will make it again!

Very easy and very good. Had kind of a nutty flavor. Think it was the olive oil. Served over spaghetti.

These were very good! Quick and easy! Only made substitution of lime juice for the lemon. These were really delicious leftover cold on top of a salad!

Great recipe, I really enjoyed and my husband raved about this. I think he told me four time how much he like this dish.  Will definitely make this again and again. I didn't have red pepper flakes and so I used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper; next time I'll use 1/3 tsp.

Delicious!  A perfect meal....zippy summer shrimp with brown rice and fresh green beans.  I have five kiddos and they love this recipe.  My son wants it for his Birthday meal.  I did not use as much lemon as it calls for and added more garlic.  Per the recipe's name..it is zippy.  I love it...but have used less red pepper flakes for the kiddos.  Excellent, healthy recipe!  :)

Very good flavor.  I like a little more sauce so I started w/ butter, sauted the shrimp and other ingredients and ended w/ some white wine.

We loved this.  I didn't have basil or paprika so I substituted with cilantro and cajun seasoning to give it a kick!  Served over greenbeans turned out to be a great healthy meal.

Liked how easy and delicious this dish is! Used crushed garlic and onl 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes...still zippy enough! Wish I had fresh basil, I think it would have even been better!

I made this recipe for dinner in a pinch when I realized we hadn't gone food shopping yet.  I had no fresh garlic or basil, so I substituted garlic salt for the salt in the recipe and used some dried basil instead.  I did fresh-squeeze a lemon as opposed to used a bottle of lemon juice.

Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and served over rotini pasta.  The result was still fantastic!

The shrimp are bursting with slightly hot, lemony flavor and the little bit of oily sauce left over from the shrimp lightly coats the pasta.  Really great, quick lunch or dinner...even if you don't have everything the recipe calls for!

Delicious! I found a great deal on fresh never been frozen shrimp at my local seafood market. I used half butter half olive oil add added a splash of pinot grigio. I had a bunch of shallots so I minced them instead of the sliced garlic. Use a good paprika. I used Hungarian half sharp paprika and it made all the difference. It added a wonderful zip. Served with pasta and a salad.

This was awesome, the fiance and I both loved it. Some extra water went into my pan while adding the shrimp, so I ended up removing the shrimp when they were done cooking and reducing the residual broth (and adding a little flour) to make it a thicker sauce for the shrimp.  It was great over rice pilaf!

The reviews that were most helpful to me were the ones that called this recipe "too subtle" . I love shrimp for the flavor of the shrimp and some sauces overpower them. This is something I will make again and again. The "zippy" was noticeable to me, hub said he would like his more so he will adjust after. Definitely will make these again. We are both on Weight Watchers so shrimp is a "pig out" food. I bought 2, 2 pound bags of the jumbo shrimp and went by count as opposed  to the weight. Didn't double the sauce and it was perfect for 60 shrimp. We left some of the sauce in the pan because of the amount of oil so my count of 20 shrimp (3 of us eating this) for 10 points was probably even a little high. Someone mentioned that these were good grilled. I bet they are - yum! Going to try that next time :)

Happened to see this was the recipe of the day, and I had all of the ingredients on hand so, I made this for dinner tonight. It was good, but as my husband said, "nothing memorable". It was quick and easy, and I didn't have to run to the store today for any ingredients but, I doubt ths recipe would ever come to mind again. For me, it just seemed to be missing something.

Perfect, I was looking for a quick simple shrimp dish that wasn't scampi and this recipe hit the spot. I didn't find it bland at all, the spice was the main flavor and the rest complemented it really well. This had a great sauce, though I thought the shrimp were flavored enough if you didn't want to serve a saucy dish. I will be making this often, thanks so much for sharing.

We Love this recipe.  I make it with shrimp and also substitute Chicken for shrimp since I am allergic.  My family can not decide which way they like it best so everyone eats both.  I serve it with Jasmine rice.  Perfect meal.

As written, it was good, however, we did drizzle a bit of melted butter over the shrimp to give it a richer flavor.  I served this over angel hair pasta with steamed asparagus.  Will def make this again!

Very good.  Decreased hot pepper flakes from 1 tsp. to 1/4 tsp. (I'm a wimp...) and added 1/4 - 1/2 cup White wine per other folks suggestions.  Served over pasta.  Hubby loved it and actually remembered to take the leftovers to work today for lunch!  Personally, I thought it was kind of hot, but too much black pepper is hot to me...  I would make again.

Delicious!!!   However, rating it 4 stars because I & I'm sure many other cooks despise messing with shelling shrimp so I purchased them all ready to cook.  Made my life much easier.  I love using my homegrown basil!!!   I also added a few grape tomatoes from the vine.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this!  Cut back on the red pepper flakes and paprika because we're not big fans of hot stuff.  Grilled the shrimp instead of pan frying and it got rave reviews.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe. I am having to be careful about combining foods, and I was able to use this and have it with a big fresh salad, oil and vinegar dressing, and be happy.

Wonderful! 
sorry I did not make as is. Did not have basil so used cilantro based on the nature of the ingredients and it was superb. Thank you again.  Served over chuka soba noodles and tossed with the shrimp before serving. This is the second time I have made this and will make it many more.

The recipe is great.  I did make a few changes.  I only had 1 pound of shrimp so I cut up a pound of tilapia (recommeded by another reviewer) and cooked with it. I also added 1 cup of chopped portabella mushrooms and sauted with the garlic.  It was great and my husband and three boys loved it.  Its delicious and so quick and easy to make. We had it with saffron rice and steamed broccoli.

This shrimp recipe is awesome! I have made this several times. This recipe is very demanded in my house. I use a bag of 24 oz. extra large frozen shrimp. The ingredients are like "staples" in my kitchen, so I can always whip this up. I do cut down on the olive oil, it seemed a little too oily. If I have white wine, I add some, it adds a nice touch. I will add some extra "zing" with some lemon peel curls on top, prior to serving. I serve with pasta or brown rice.

Very tasty.  I used peeled prawns and they were fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

I will omit the salt next time as the prawns didn't need any more than a pinch.

This was awesome! I doubled the recipe and poured the shrimp and leftover sauce over plain spaghetti noodles cooked in chicken broth. Super simple and people raved on how good it was. One person complained it was a little too spicy for them, but oh well...I will not change this recipe. Perfect!

Good flavor, easy to make, but way to "zippy" for my little girl..... so I spread alittle sour cream/cream cheese blend on a heated tortilla, some lettuce, and she ate a shrimp wrap while I devoured the rest. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, I will make it again but will cut the lemon juice in half.  I realized after I served it that I forgot to add any salt, but the sour lemon taste was so overwhelming that it almost simulated the taste of salt...  in balance it would be good but according to the recipe was too overwhelming (I used bottled lemon juice).  Otherwise a nice, light, healthy meal.  I recommend cooking other veggies with it and serving over brown rice or another starch.  I definitely did not find it filling enough to eat about 10 large shirmp with a side of green beans...

I am sorry but I didn't like this dish at all. I followed the recipe (except for decreasing the lemon juice by 1/2- since I already don't like the acidity). To me there was NO flavor and then at the end there was a bite. It would be nice with some salt or some thing...anything to balance out the heat. I had to completely rinse them off in order to serve them with the alfredo I was serving. I will not make this again-  Sorry, but I was so excited due to the clever name and great reviews which I normally fall in with...just not this time.

This recipe is delicious! Quick and easy to prepare for company. I serve over orzo that I also drizzle with lemon. I also use a 1/2 cup of dry white wine in the recipe. One of my absolute favorites!

I don't care for shrimp unless it comes deep fried, but I made this for my husband, and not only did he like it, but I too gobbled 'em up.  So easy to do and a nice compliment to any meal.

I found this recipe but when you make it you want to be very careful to not put too much lemon juice, and you want to make sure you dont put too much salt in it. If your anything like me you put a little dab here and there. Just be careful when making it.

It was very quick and easy to make and very tasty. I served it to a guest and they loved it! I served it with angel hair which was a little too small for this...fettacini would be better I think. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! Just used 1 lb of shrimp for our family of 4 and it was plenty. I used the same recipe except 1 tsp of cayenne and there was enough sauce for noodles but not quite enough for four people.

Very good! My only complaints are that the first time I tried to make this, "high" turned out to be too high of a setting and the garlic burned! The second time around I set it to medium and everything worked out. This may have been my fault, though. Also, the paprika was a bit too overpowering for my taste, so next time I'll tone it down like another reviewer suggested. All in all, though, great recipe, and I'd definitely make this again!

Great recipe ! only had 14 oz bag of medium shrimp so improvised. Used One clove of garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil, tablespoon of salted butter.Added two green onions, medium size garden tomato, juice of half a lemon and teaspoon of paprika /red pepper.Gathered 4-5 leaves of fresh basil and added them with a hearty dash of cider vinegar( wanted basamic but it was hiding.) Towards the end of cooking  put in some red wine. Added whole wheat spaghetti to the shrimp and chowed down. Next attempt will be with Jumbo shrimp as medium just got to rubbery tasting .Good combination of flavors all in all

I followed the recipe, except I only used 1 lb of frozen, peeled, and deveined shrimp. I also only had dried basil, so used 2tsp of that. When everything was finished (super quick!!) I tossed in some cold leftover pasta I had in the fridge. Absolutely perfect meal with a fresh salad. Even my 11 year old son loved it! :) Thank you!

Definitely zippy.  I tried to make this with a little mexican flair, so I added a dash of cumin and 1/2 chopped chipotle pepper.  It had an awesome flavor and worked great served over black beans and corn salad.  Will try without the mexican flavor as well and I am sure we will like it as well.  Thanks for a great, versatile recipe.

Be careful, if your skillet is too hot and you add the spices you are in for a surprise! This was very good, and just the right amount of flavor. Definitely shell all the shrimp, because when its greased and coated with spices it makes for a messy eating if you do not.

LOVED this!!! It's a must try. I made it with whole wheat penne pasta and streamed green beans with almonds on the side.  I added in 1/4 cup dry white cooking wine with the lemon juice and only 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. It's a perfect summer recipe....quick, easy, and light.  I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to put together.  I wanted more sauce for the pasta, so I added white wine as it was cooking.  My children had never eaten shrimp, and this was a pretty easy recipe to ease them into it.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  I prepared this as per the recipe and it was perfect! Served it over orzo pasta with stir fried veggies (frozen, from a bag, oh no!) but zipped up the veggies with some lemon zest.  This was a sensational taste treat, especially when served with a chilled white wine!

I received 3 thumbs up. I shot a little lime juice and added a shake of Tabasco. Added to the pepper flakes it was just the right amount of heat. We were in a hurry so did this with 3 pounds of frozen large shrimp, rush thawed via microwave and hit a home run. I think there's one forkful of pasta left in the pan.

Really excellent!  I made this with one pound of shrimp for just the two of us and kept the rest of the ingredients the same except for the red pepper flakes.  I added a splash of chicken stock and a tablespoon of butter to the sauce and served this over thin spaghetti.  It was nice and spicy.  I will definitely serve this one again.

I also use the frozen & cooked large shrimp.  But to add it to pasta you really need some sauce or the pasta's kind of tasteless and dry.  I add some jarred Alfredo sauce, diced tomatoes (and juices to lighten it up if desired).  Also add some tomato or basil pesto to really up the flavor.  Yum!

This is the BOMB! I only used 1 pound of 16-20 count shrimp but kept the seasoning quantity the same.  To keep it from being so messy, I also removed the shells from the shrimp before cooking.  Fast, easy and delicious!!

made it last night. Served with rice and broccoli. My family was very pleased. I have used just a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, as another reader mentioned it will be too spicy with full teaspoon. Will definitely make it again.

Quick and wondeful. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and it worked out fine. Before serving I splashed a little lemon juice over the entire dish which gave it a more tangier flavor.

It was really good recipe. My only complain is that it was too spicy even for me! Next time I'll put half of the chillies and the paprika and no pepper.Used dried basil too.

LOVED IT!!  I did use mild smoked paprika in place of the normal paprika, minced the garlic instead of slicing, added some white wine along with the lemon juice and since I didn't have fresh basil, parsley had to stand in!  Served this over white rice with some steamed broc/carrots and really enjoyed it!  I think the  smoked paprika really made it.  There was a nice kick to this dish, although hubby didn't find it spicy at all, just 'flavourful' as he put it.  For those of us with less 'tolerant palettes', this had a wee bite, but excellent and will make again!

This is a great combination of flavors. I cut the chilis to 1/2 . My husband thought it was plenty hot enough. I will replace the lemon juice with white wine next time, so it is not quite as acidic.

This was tasty...  Couple of changes:  I used less oil, maybe 1/4 c, minced garlic rather than sliced, dried vs fresh basil, smoked paprika (YUM!!!) just a splash of lemon juice and about 1/2 the red pepper flakes called for because of my 4 yr old.  This was good and I will likely use this recipe again.  I liked the fact that there was a little bit of sauce still in the pan and would like to make use of it over pasta next time.  I served this with orzo with basil and parm from this site and some sauteed veggies. It all went very well together.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is really good exactly as written.  

I usually make this as written, but tonight I tried experimenting because I wanted to use some vegetables.  I added some diced onions a moment after the garlic.  Then I added sliced mushrooms before adding the spices. I added a bit of white wine before adding the shrimp.  I did the rest as written, but I added one diced tomato right at the end before the basil.   It was very good also.   I served it on pasta.  I tried it with and without Parmesan cheese and both were good.  Also, because of my young kids, I have to cut the red pepper flakes in half.  Still yummy.

Added the garlic with the shrimp to keep from burning.  Jim had already started peeling the shrimp so we cooked it without shells.  So quick and delicious.

This was great.  I made it and served it on top of shell pasta. I used slightly less lemon juice than was called for and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely make it again,  and it only took the same amount of time that the pasta did to cook.

Super. The shrimp really have a kick to them. I did add some additional garlic and white wine and then added my angel hair pasta into the pan with the shrimp to get all the good flavor mixed with the pasta. Served immediatley. A keeper. Thank You for sharing. I have made this on several occasions and the dish has sooo much flavor. FRESH basil over the top at the last minute, really makes this special. Thank You Again.

Great flavor! I used grapeseed oil (higher smoke point) and cooked shrimp over medium heat. There was still plenty of liquid left after the shrimp cooked, so I removed shrimp with slotted spoon, added white wine and reduced to create a sauce. Even more delicious the next day.

I'm embarrassed to go against all the five star reviews, but I didn't like it nearly as much as regular scampi. I think it needs to have at least half butter/half olive oil to be five star. I followed the recipe to a "T" even adding a little more basil for flavor but then we tasted it and found it to be bland so we added garlic salt and old bay seasoning to up the flavor. I might make this again sometime with the addition of butter. Thanks for posting, I'm always looking for new ways to use fresh basil.

I cleaned and left the tails on. (More good stuff to soak in) The recipe was full of flavor and finger lickin'. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 evoo.  An extra squeeze of lemon at the end.  Thanks for this recipe.

Great recipe, I halved it (only needed enough for 2 people) and served over linguine; I only used a 1/4 tsp of red pepper because we have low spice tolerance, upped the garlic a little and it turned out perfect!

Where is the zip? My husband added cayenne pepper to his. Clearly not spicy at all. I wasn’t a fan either. It’s definitely missing something.

I cooked the garlic on a lower heat than suggested, thanks to reminders from other reviewers. I used frozen uncooked shrimp from trader Joe's, defrosted, then removed the tails. I added butter to the oil up front and didn't have any paprika but it turned out great! 

I served it over wild rice and can't get over how beautiful it looks. I posted a photo. Because it makes me look like I know what I'm doing. Which I so do not. 

This is definitely going to be all up in the rotation.

for being so simple this dish was really tasty.. i cut the recipe in half and used a lot less oil (trying to cut calories) and upped the garlic to 2 cloves.. i only had dried basil and bottled lemon but this still came out really good! cut down on the red pepper flakes (my stomach has been temperamental lately) and eyeballed the salt.. i'll be making this again and again.. ty so much for the recipe

This is amazing!! my boyfriend and I loved it. the only down side is the shell. the recipe didn't say to take the shell off so when I left it on it became an obstacle trying to eat it.

I only had half the amount of shrimp, 1 lb., but I still kept the recipe the same otherwise.  I also added flat leaf parsley to the dish and it turned out great.  Will make again and use the same recipe for other shellfish.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it for Fathers Day and my gourmet cook husband loved it as did my teenage daughter.  I halved the recipe for the three of us using a 12 Oz. bag of raw unpeeled jumbo shrimp.  The only changes I made was to double the amount of garlic (for the half recipe, 3 big cloves) and also the amount of fresh basil.  I also added 2 tablespoons of butter to the olive oil.  I served it over linguine with butter, along with a green salad and a crusty baguette.  Delicious!

This s a fabulous recipe.  It has the perfect amount of seasonings and is so easy and fast.  I served this over pasta but I can see this recipe used as an appetizer.  This is a keeper.

Loved it.  I made 2 times - 1st time I got a little over zelous with the red pepper flakes and it was a little too spicy. The 2nd time I was a little more careful and it turned out wonderful!

Really good.  The only thing I did differently was to add thinly sliced onion to the sauteeing garlic and spices.  Served with angel hair pasta.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes. It is quick to make and full of flavor. Garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon and fresh basil are each great on their own, and combining them is even better. 

I have also made this dish with chicken, and even as the sauce for a veggie stir fry, in addition to making it with shrimp as the recipe calls. It's great served over rice with steamed or sauteed vegetables.

It was too acidic for my taste but my bf loved it.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes but instead red bell pepper, as others have previously done because it would be too spicy otherwise. I tried to tone down the acidic taste with white wine, not much success. 
Anyway, it was a simple recipe with a really good presentation.

I made this recipe as written and served it on a bed of rotini pasta. It was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. The pepper flake gave it just enough kick to live up to the name zippy.

My daughter and fiancee made this for me on Mother's Day. Overall, it was a good dish with a lot of flavor. The one thing we all agreed on was that there was too much lemon juice. I would cut back on that next time.

This recipe is amazing.  So fast and easy to fix.  The flavors blend so well. Mixed the shrimp and sauce with brown rice.  It was delicious.
If you're afraid of spicy, add a little avocado after cooking.  It cuts the spice and the flavor blends really well with all the other ingredients.

We added in fresh kale, broccoli, red pepper, lemon basil, and lemon time from the garden. The lemon and red pepper flavor combination makes this simple dish wonderful!  Kudos...

I rate this recipe 3 stars because the flavor wasn't so good to me. Also instead of using olive oil I used butter because the olive was frying and burning the ingredients although I had the stove on low heat.

I shrunk the portion size just a bit because it is only my husband and I eating it and I forgot to shrink the portion of pepper flakes! WOOPS, so for me it was a bit to hot and gave me heart burn instantly but the hubby just loved it! I also added one fresh chopped tomato (with seeds still in) and that seemed to cook lovely with it. very good recipe over all!

Made with 1 pound of frozen , thawed shrimp and served it with whole wheat spaghetti. There was enough sauce to sufficiently cover the pasta and it ended up serving 3 people. Very easy to prepare because I had all the ingredients measured out beforehand. I used a very heaping  teaspoon of red peppers and a bit more because we like spicy and it was delicious.

Excellent! Just made it this evening as part of our New Years eve dinner. Loved how the sauce thickens up a bit.  Very tasty, and always good to have a new shrimp recipe to go to, as we love seafood.

It was okay. I think I ruined it by putting the shrimp in the skillet frozen. I ended up with a puddle after water melted off of them. I think tomorrow I might cook some rice and mix the shrimps with the rice.

Omg this was so good! I followed this recipe to the exact. Loved it except for the fact having to peel the shrimp to put them on the pasta. May try with peeled shrimp next time just for convenience.

Spices were a great combo for the Shrimp. I stir-fried zucchini, yellow squash , onion, red and green pepper in olive  oil and lightly used seasoned salt. Stirred in with pasta and put the shrimp on top. I wouldn't change a thing with the shrimp recipe itself.  Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful recipe.  I love it that you can use this shrimp dish with almost anything (rice, pasta, salad, etc..).  It's become one of my favorite ways of cooking shrimp.  Thank you for posting it.

Yum!  What's not to mess up here?  Kind of foolproof.  Adjust it any way within reason and you are still going to have a great result.  Pair it up with "Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Apples, Golden Raisins and Walnuts" (here on Allrecipes.com - well, ok I only had pecans but it was great), plus some brown rice and you'll look like a healthy gourmet cook!  Try it!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I have a question.  When do you peel the shrimp?  It doesn't say in the recipe.  Before cooking?  If so, why not just use peeled shrimp?  That's what I usually use.

Tried this last.  Used dried basil instead of fresh and put it over angel hair pasta with Italian tomatoes added a bit if broccoli and it came out fabulous!

This was excellent! I only made a small amount with some frozen cooked shrimp that I wanted to move, if you know what I mean. I can only imagine how much better it would be with uncooked shrimp! I was a little leery about the basil, but that, along with the lemon, were the best and most prevalent flavors. The heat added to it in a good way as well. Delicious! Thanks REBECCADK! (Now, bring on summer!!)

Delicious, fast, and lovely on the plate.  Followed recipe EXACTLY, and served over white rice -- YUM! Love! Then, I used this recipe as a "go to base recipe" when I didn't have lemons or fresh basil on hand (just the other half of that bag of frozen shrimp in the freezer)  Followed exactly for as long as I could -- added shrimp to the pan of evoo, slivered garlic, pepper flakes, paprika --- then to create a "steaming effect" instead of lemon juice i did a few shakes of rice-wine vinegar over the shrimp and put a lid on the saute pan ---- VOILA!  served them over rice --- delish.  (personally, i missed the fresh bright taste of the basil & lemon, but my friend who hadn't had it the "real way" thought it was awesome --- i did too, actually)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, but there were a few changes I'll make next time. I felt like it could have used more spice; Either red pepper, basil, or both. I also think I'll tone down the lemon juice next time, it was a little intense to me. Other than that, quick and perfect.

This is so delicious!  Great flavor and a bit spicy - just the way I like it!  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make again and again.  The recipe was so easy and it only took me about 15 minutes to make.  Can't wait to try it over rice.

These shrimp were amazing!! I followed the recipe to a T! It was so easy and quick, perfect for a busy weeknight, but still fancy enough to be presented at a party. Beyond versatile!! The shrimp soaked up so many delicious flavors that all worked incredibly wonderful together!!! I will be making this again and again!! Thank you for this delish recipe!

it was good but it needed more flavor. I used fresh lemon juice but bottled basil. Served over rotini with broccoli and breadsticks. if I made it again, I'd try butter instead of olive oil, and something else...

UPDATE: I did this again (as before) and I really liked it. (added star from 3 to 4)

This one is not a keeper for me. I followed the directions exactly and it came out looking nothing like the picture. The oil turned dark, the red pepper and paprika turned black. It wasn't visually appealing and the taste was bland. If anyone has any pointers, please share.

Very good and super fast for a worknight since I used precooked shrimp. Since I know that much red pepped would be too zippy for us I did cut it in half.And it was PLENTY zippy! It would have been intolerably spicy for us with a whole tsp as written...so it loses  a star there from me.

This recipe is so simple and so savory yet not heavy. I paired it with arugula, grape tomatoes, red onions and balsamic vinegar. It was a perfect simple meal prepared in exactly the amount of time the recipe says.

Yummy!  I wanted enough sauce to put over pasta so I took the suggestions of others and added some butter at the beginning and some wine with the lemon juice.  Everything else was the same.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! We followed the recipe, only halving it as it was just for two, and used green prawn meat from our supermarket. It was quick, easy and just the perfect mix of basil,lemon  and chile flavour. *** Just did this dish again using a marinara mix (prawns, fish, mussels, squid) and the flavour was perfect! The lemon and the chili really work well with other seafood besides prawns! This dish is now a staple in our kitchen.

It had a real nice kick to it. We loved it and friends even ate the left overs the next night and devoured it and rant and raved about it. I only had the medium frozen shrimp on hand, so I used them. Will try the raw ones next time. It was quick and easy to make. The only thing I did is make extra sauce to it to make it go a little farther over pasta. Some butter, flour and milk, with chicken bouillon for flavor, to whatever thickness you want. Just made it a little creamier. Will make again.

This dish was easy & very flavorful.  I even got a "yeah, you can make this one again" from my husband, which is a pretty solid compliment from him.  I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I used a touch of cayenne, which gave it a little heat. We will definitely make this one again!

So good!  I only used one bag of frozen and it wasn't enough.  I also omitted the red pepper flakes for the kiddos, but I think they would make a great addition.  I serve over rice and mix in edamame.

LOVE IT!! Quick and delicious what else could you ask for. Served it the other night over pasta, and tonight ate it cold with a salad. The only change I made was to add a little less of the pepper flakes (1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon) because I was afraid it would be too spicy. It was just right for us.

Loved this. Only adaptation was dried basil instead of fresh. Well, and I didn't measure the olive oil. Served with a rice dish, which absorbed the sauce nicely.

These shrimp were wonderfully easy to do. No modifications necessary! Served as an appetizer at my daughters 50th and they were literarally devoured by everyone. Thanks for sharing and will definitely use again.

Everyone loved these. I made a marinaded with the shells on for about an hour and added cilantro, fresh thai basil from the garden and a few sprigs of fresh curry herb plant. I grilled them on indirect heat until almost cooked and them put on direct flame for less than a minute on each side and they came out wonderful. Thanks for the recipes.

I served this a couple nights ago for myself and my boyfriend.  We thought it had pretty good flavor, but felt that the "sauce" was a little thin.  We also think we might use lime juice rather than lemon next time we make it--seemed you couldn't really taste the lemon.\  Also, as another reviewer commented, watch the garlic while you're cooking it.  I didn't pay enough attention at first, and ended up with garlic chips :-(  Had to start over.

I made this with frozen shelled raw shrimp. I also used less red pepper flakes so it was less spicy. It was great served over rice with a salad.

A really great marinade with just enough spice to give it a little zing.  Loved this and will definitely make this again.  I marinated this all day in all the ingredients listed and then grilled them on the BBQ.  YUM!

Wow, this was so delicious and healthy!  I reduced the ingredient amounts to serve one person, and served it over white rice.  I cooked stir-fry vegetables in the sauce along with the shrimp.  I am definitely going to make this again.  I bet it would be fabulous with chicken, too.

I made this last night with only minor changes and give it 5 stars (4 stars as written). The small changes I made were these: 1) combine the lemon juice with the paprika, red pepper flakes, and olive oil; 2) Just before finishing with the fresh basil, add 3-cheese Italian blend to the sauce to thicken (we like thick sauces in our house); 3) double the fresh basil. I used the shrimp I had on hand, which was pre-cooked ... came out beautifully. My husband, who is Cajun, raved about the perfect spicy flavor. It's a hit!

I and all my guests love this recipe everytime I make it.  I make this as a marinade then put the shrimp on the grill.  I add 2 tbs of spaghetti sauce also.  I use cayenne instead of red pepper.

This dish was delicious!  My husband was ecstatic about it!  However, my ten-year-old and six-teen-year old said that this "wasn't their favorite".  Maybe a little too strong for picky eaters.

LOVE this meal! Super easy and very delicious. Instead of rice, I add mine to angel hair whole wheat pasta that I lightly coat with olive oil, pepper and salt first.

Great recipe for entertaining.  It IS spicy as written.  I too used frozen shrimp and  was still delicious! Served with rice pilaf and steamed green beans.  Delicious and not so filling that you feel like you overate.

Thanks for such a great recipe!  I was looking for a simple way to prepare shrimp, and not as just a way to prepare the shrimp to add to pasta.  We actually served this shrimp as a side dish to a vegetarian pasta dish, but next time I will prepare as the main course.  It was quite a bit spicy, but still enjoyable.

Very nice flavors. It's super easy to make healthier by using less oil and adjusting the lemon down a bit to account for less oil. Everyone loved it. Tasty!

This was very good!  I served it over 1 pound of angel hair pasta.  The only change I will make in the future is to cut the oil a little.  It was slightly more oily than our usual pasta dishes.  May try to substitute some white wine or chicken stock for part of the oil next time.

Excellent!!!!!   Even my picky teenagers liked it! Didn't put as much red pepper flakes but it still had a nice little kick.

Delicious!  I used about 3 TBS of lemon juice and 1 TBS of dry white wine just to be sure it was not too tangy for the little one.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe completely and it was great. This would be a wonderful appetizer as well! I did peal the shrimp for the main course, but I think for an appetizer I will keep the shells on and add a little more garlic and red pepper flakes for a zippier taste. It would be great served with a rustic french bread or a side of cheese garlic bread.

I used butter instead of oil and this was DELICIOUS! People were using the sauce that was leftover and dipping the bread in it! It was THAT good! Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as stated.  Too much paprika for me and my family. I might try it again substituting the paprika with something else. Didnt think it was overly spicy either. Maybe I'll play with the recipe a little next time or maybe I'll just try another one.

Very fast and tasty. I had to use garlic salt and dried basil instead of the fresh ingredients, but it was still delicious.

Fantastic! Very easy.  I followed some of the reviews below and used de-veined, partially shelled fresh shrimp -- I wouldn't have done it any other way.  The flavor really soaks into the shrimp. I served with whole wheat fettucini & some parmesan Yum! Thanks for this recipe!!

I served this over linguine and it was quite good.  I was pleasantly surprised considering there are so few ingredients and it's so simple.  The only thing I didn't use was the red pepper flakes and that's only because I have a 2 yr old who would not have been happy w/me if I had added this.

Simple and delicious recipe. I followed as directed, with the following exceptions: I used lots of fresh garlic, half the pepper flakes called for (gave it a nice kick, but we didn't have to chase it down with water), and no basil (being that I had none). I also used lime instead of lemon juice. The only thing I'll change next time is cutting back on the oil .. it was quite greasy with that much oil. Sauteeing the garlic in a few TBS of oil and adding chicken broth would probably work well.

This was good! Very fast and easy and yummy! Not recommended if you don't like spice tho - I cut back on the heat and my sister and my mom still couldn't eat it (they don't like spicy). But every one else thought it was great! I made it over steamed white rice and used the extra sauce for the rice.
