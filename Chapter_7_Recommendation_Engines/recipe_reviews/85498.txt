I found this recipe while searching for a good way to enjoy mustard greens without all the bacon drippings (I'm a vegetarian). Let me tell you - this recipe is a huge favorite with both myself and my husband (who is an omnivore). Keep all the ingredients the same, BUT there is no need to blanch the greens. Simply add a bit of water or broth to your cooking pot after sauteing, throw in the greens, bring the heat down to low, cover and steam for a few minutes before carrying on with the rest of the recipe. That keeps some nutrients in the pot - and also makes clean-up a little easier.

I serve the curry over brown rice, and always serve a side of roasted sweet potatoes and onions that have been tossed in oil and cayenne. The flavor of the sweet potato mashed in with a big bite of curry is absolute heaven... And when I bring the leftovers to work for lunch, I get jealous comments every single time. I can't throw out enough superlatives about this one.

This is a great greens recipe!  I made it vegan by using olive oil instead of ghee and 2 tablespoons soy yogurt instead of the cream. Also  I used red curry powder instead of the usual yellow.

Schwang! This dish was like 'ol South marries Indian.  We liked it.  Instead of half and half I used lite coconut milk and did take the advice from above and added some garlic.  Also I used 1/2 tsp. of powdered ginger in place of fresh.   Nearly made the error of using scallions instead of shallots - because here in the South we say green onion more often.  This shows I'm still learning.

This was absolutely delicious made with fresh mustard (and some kale) greens from the garden.  I used coconut milk (low-fat) instead of the cream, onions and garlic instead of the shallots, home canned tomatoes, extra ginger and a lil bit of garam masala.  Yummy and a great way to eat some nutritious greens and beans.

Excellent. I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced. I had no half/half so I used plain yogurt. I served it over basmati rice. It was delicious and very nutritious. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you.

Very easy, pretty good.  I didn't know whether or not to cut up the greens, so I chopped the bunch up in 3-4" lengths.  I might go even a little smaller next time, especially since my toddler will also be eating this.  I used olive oil instead of ghee (since I had it...), 1/2 a sweet onion (because I think shallots are expensive :-), and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of the 1/2 and 1/2.  I also added salt & pepper.  I think it was a little bland, so next time I'll increase the curry and the red pepper. And I'm thinking I'll add some raisins!  
P.S. Don't forget to make some rice to serve this dish over.

Halfway through making this I asked myself, "Self, why am I making this?  It can't be good..."  Well, I was wrong!  This is a very authentic tasting Indian dish!  I did substitute home-canned tomatoes for the tomato sauce, and discovered my half and half was out of date so used buttermilk.  Absolutely incredible!!!  Really hit the spot served along pork tenderloin and a roasted sweet potato!

This is an excellent recipe, and a great change from greens with bacon. We used collard greens instead of mustard, ground ginger instead of ginger root, chopped onion instead of shallots, olive oil instead of ghee; and added chopped garlic and 1/2 t. garam masala. I didn't cook it but I sure ate it! I provided the recipe and my son had it waiting for me when I got home from work. Fast, easy and very tasty. And healthy! Would add more crushed red next time, possibly cubed chicken, and will serve it over Basmati rice. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I liked this, but it definitely seemed to be missing something. I had to add salt (not called for in the recipe). Not sure how this garnered so many 5-star ratings.

Very good!  It does need more flavor though.  I added a teaspoon of additional curry and about 1 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  I didn't have shallots so I just used green onions and added onion powder.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes because I realized the tomato sauce I bought had basil and oregano in it. I also salted it to taste.

I have to agree with the other reviewers, this was very good!  Of course, I changed it to what I had on hand.  Browned 2 onions in ghee for about 15 mins before adding 4 cloves chopped garlic, 3 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  cooked another 5 mins then added 15 oz crushed tomatoes, 1 can coconut milk, kidney bean, and one of those big bags of prewashed and cut kale greens.  Added 2 tsp salt, stirred to combine and soften greens a bit then let simmer gently for 20-30 minutes.  Stirred occasionally during cooking.  This was such a great combination of flavors and had a nice, rich taste.  Served over some brown rice.  Yum!

really really yummy! DO NOT BOIL THE GREENS! it makes them loose a lot of their nutrients. And keep the stems! they will soften but actually have more nutrients than leaves. I mixed it all (except the greens) together after cooking shallots and then placed the layer of chopped greens over the top and slowly worked it in as it wilted, which didn't take long. I would also choose a different bean - something softer.
Made the following subs for doubled recipe:
>coconut milk for half and half
>one can of diced tomatoes and one sauce (rather than 2 sauce)
>ginger powder for fresh (couldn't find in store)
I put it over rice but that reduced the nice strong flavors... I would prefer adding some veg stock and having it as a stew. Was surprisingly easy and so good!!

A great tasting, practical, healthy, every day meal, even if omitting salt is necessary (though we added some). This is good on rice, on naan, or whipped up into a bean dip (color's odd though, so make it deeper green by adding extra fresh spinach, & season to taste with salt, sweetener, vinegar and more spices). We forgot the red pepper & were fine without it for now. We'll put raisins on the table next time. We added coconut milk because we had some open. We used fresh spinach & it held up wonderfully, stirring it into the skillet after cooking the onion, garlic, & ginger, then added spices & all other ingredients, & simmered while making naan. Presentation might be better if greens are trimmed in thin strips - we'll see. Not fans of store bought curry powder so we used quick garam masala recipe from this sight. Wonderful alternative! We also had a small can of tomato paste open in the fridge already so used that. My husband added all of the tomato paste from that can which he could get out of it, which was a hint to me that he was looking for some salt. Sure enough the salt did the trick, though I added a pinch of sugar to round it out. Tomato paste was not too strong at all - maybe because of the sugar? Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I'd always hated kidney beans, but, believing all foods are good if one simply knows how to prepare them, I turned to allrecipes to find ways to enjoy kidney beans. That faith in allrecipes paid off again!

I would have given this 3 stars, but my partner really liked it, so 4. I used regular butter and coconut milk instead of the 1/2 and 1/2, and just steamed the greens, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. We needed to add a lot more curry and I thought it was too tomato-ey. Next time I will use a large can of coconut milk and a small can of tomato sauce. Also, coconut oil instead of butter. Oh, and be sure to trim the stems and chop the greens.

Second Try: Doubled the curry and added a dash of Garam Marsala. Only used an 8oz can of tomato sauce. MUCH better!

This is a pretty good way to get those healthy dark greens in your diet in a different way.  Being vegetarian, we are always looking for good sources of veggies and protiens.  I used 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup skim milk.  in place of the half and half and used olive oil instead of ghee.

My husband and I have had this twice without the 1/2 & 1/2. I used pinto beans once and dark red kidneys once.  We agreed that we prefer the pintos.  We have used mustard greens and chard; either is great.  Also, we didn't have tomato paste so we used diced tomatoes.  This is a great side dish or can be the main dish with some good bread on a cool night (instead of chili).

Yummy! It sounds like such a strange combination of ingredients, but it is delicious. I upped the curry and red pepper flakes (3 tsp curry and a couple good shakes of red pepper), and that was just right for me and my spice-loving husband. We used heavy cream instead of half and half, but other than that followed the recipe as written. Next time I will use more mustard greens (1.5 or maybe even 2 bunches) and possibly sautee them in the curry so as not to lose the nutrients (which will mean adding more liquid to the curry).

This was very tasty. I'd found some mustard greens by surprise in the grocery store and was looking for a way to use them. I had to tweak the recipe a little based on what I had (EVOO instead of ghee, two large purple-topped scallions for the shallots). I did add one large clove of garlic, minced fine (Indian food just isn't without it to me), and I had to had about 1/2 t. salt because I'd used sodium-free tomato sauce. I  micro-steamed the greens to save time and water, but other than that, I followed the directions to the letter.

The dish was finished about 40 minutes before we were going to eat, so I sliced some leftover pork loin about 1/3" thick, nestled the slices in the sauce, covered the pot, turned the heat to low and just left it. When we were ready, I spooned the beans and greens onto the plates, making a bed for the sliced pork, a la restaurant , and drizzled more sauce over the top.  We didn't even need any starch with it. Lovely! The curried sauce warmed the pork slices through without drying them out--so tasty! I'll make this again using kale or spinach if I can't find mustard greens. Thanks for sharing.

I wanted to like this but it was all just so bitter.  I guess that's just the mustard greens but I was hoping that the curry taste would take over but it didn't.

This one goes in the "keep" pile, for sure! The one thing I changed was that I added 2 tsp of chili garlic sauce instead of pepper flakes. And next time, I will double the beans.

This combination, I thought, would have rubbed me the wrong way, but it really works. In fact i'm eating it as i type. My question is, why boil greens and drain? why not keep all the nutrients as intact as possible? would it be bitter?

I accidentally bought mustard greens thinking they were kale. I got quite a surprise when I put it in my green smoothie! I was like, "what the heck am I going to do with these spicy things?". So, I found this recipe and it sounded good. Well, after trying it - I will  intentionally buy mustard greens again, just to make this recipe. I loved it.

I did make a few adjustments to make it vegan and to accommodate for ingredients that I didn't have on hand. I used coconut oil for the ghee, 1/2 can coconut milk for the half and half, and I didn't have any tomato sauce - so I put a can of diced tomatoes in the blender. Served it with brown basmati rice. Yum!

Very good.  You will need some salt and pepper. I also used coconut sauce and fresh ginger.

My family loved this dish (and we don"t normally care for greens)!  I did modify it for waht I had on hand.  I had greens given to me and I don't know what kinds they were.  Also I substituted regular butter for ghee, onion for shallot, and ginger spice for grated fresh ginger.  I'm sure it would have been even better if I had the correct ingredients.

I had never eaten mustard greens before but bought some this weekend at the farmer's market.  Found this recipe and it sounded so completely different that I had to try it!  YUM!!  I think I overdid the red pepper a bit, but that was my fault.  Next time I will use coconut milk, cause that's the way I roll, I used olive oil instead of ghee just for ease factor, but as is is delish!  Thanks!

Sooo delicious! I read other reviews before cooking and combined some ideas. It turned out DELISH! 

I used fresh mustard greens from garden and prepared them as recipe stated. I then used just 1 t. of olive oil to sauteed 1/2 mild (maui) onion (no garlic as others suggested--too strong).  Then I grated two inches of ginger root (prob. 1 T.). Then the pinch of flakes, the beans, the tomato sauce, FINALLY, I used 2 t. of RED CURRY POWDER and 1/2 c. of LITE COCONUT MILK. Yummy, healthy, and low-fat. Quick too. Highly recommend.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that it was a great everyday dish, and not for a special occasion.  I did make a few changes. I tore the greens up and rinsed them, and then steamed them in a covered microwave dish on high for 6 mintues.  I used light olive oil (didn't have ghee).  I used a 15 oz. can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce.  As a couple of other reviewers suggested I added a shake of garam masala and tossed in a handful of raisins.  This was fast, easy to make, and was yummy over basmati rice.  I will make this again.  Tip:  Store your peeled ginger in the freezer: it grates easily and will last a long time.  I prefer to grate my ginger so no one gets a big chunk of it. Remember that rice takes awhile to cook, and plan accordingly.

This was so quick & easy, and a great way for me to use the mustard greens from my farm share. I wanted a stronger flavor though so I about doubled the amount of curry powder and added a couple cloves of garlic. Yum!

very good, but i think it needed a little extra something. Next time I'll try adding fresh garlic and/or more onion.   All the same, still a good recipe. Even my picky boyfriend liked it, although he used it as a chip dip instead of eating it over rice.

I was looking for a new way to cook up some greens I have made them all sorts of ways but this has got to be my favorite thus far. I did make some changes only because I wanted to use  what I had on hand. I used mustard greens and some turnip greens. I did not have shallots so I used onion and garlic also I used whole milk instead of the half and half. the end result was delicious I will try next time to steam the greens in the pot instead of blanching them separately to retain more nutrients.

delicious! I used coconut milk instead of the half and half and I used a bit less than the whole can of tomato. I also added a bit more curry powder than what was called for. 
I didn't pre boil the mustard greens. Instead I cut them up into smaller pieces and just added a bit of water to the frying pan to steam the greens in the pan. I didn't use the stalks but I think next time I would use more of the stalks. 
The dish tasted amazing! I served it with brown rice and some pork tenderloin that I coated in coconut oil, garlic, and salt and broiled it in the oven . Thanks for a terrific recipe. I will definitely make it again.

Love this recipe. I did make a few changes as suggested by other raters.  I used onions, canned tomatoes and the coconut milk.  Really tasty and a great way to eat mustard greens. I also ate it like a soup so yummy and no need to cook rice.

My husband and I loved this!  I made some changes only because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used butter, onion, chick peas, and I blended ricotta cheese with low fat milk instead of the half and half and served it over brown rice it was yummy.  The ginger and curry are delicious in this dish.  I will be making this again very soon, next time I will try it with coconut milk.

I was genuinely surprised at how delicious this dish was. It's a fantastic introduction to mustard greens, and all the ingredients are easily available and inexpensive (I did substitute regular unsalted stick butter for ghee). The blend of tomato sauce, half-and-half, and curry is absolutely amazing and I see myself using that blend as a base in other recipes in the future. Highly recommend giving this recipe a try!

Very tasty!  I subbed in coconut milk for the half and half and just used regular butter.  I made mine pretty spicy and added in ~3/4 cup cubed butternut squash and think it turned out pretty good. I also served mine with a combo of barley and quinoa and thought it gave a great texture to the curry.

I'm sure it was fine as is,,,but I soaked some adzuki beans, homemade yogurt for 1/2 & 1/2 and had no premade curry so threw in a mixture of cinnnamon, coriander, tumeric, asafoetida and cumin, and pureed diced tomatoes. Served with a chunk of naan and cauliflower kadhi,,,would make again.

Excellent taste. I followed some suggestions using olive oil instead of ghee, soy milk instead of half and half and garlic and onions instead of shallots. I also added a pinch of garam masala and used 6oz tomato paste mixed with water to make "tomato sauce." Delicious and healthy.

Flavorful, exotic! I added a can of garbanzo beans and skipped the rice side dish. If you rinse and chop the greens ahead of time, dinner can be on the table in minutes!

Yum! Used one onion and one clove of garlic instead of shallots. Used can diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Added 1t salt. Make sure to simmer for 10 minutes or so to let the flavors blend. This is one of my new favorite Indian inspired dishes!

This dish makes me so happy to be vegan (with a few changes, that is)!  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I tweaked the original recipe a bit.  I used safflower oil instead of the ghee and soy milk instead of the half & half.  I added an extra tsp of curry and about 1/2 cup of raisins also.  The raisins are a must (thank you to the previous reviewer who suggested it!)  I served it over wild rice.  This recipe is a keeper!

Really good with coconut milk instead of cream!! Added a little garlic and some sugar to balance out the spiciness of the curry and bitterness of the greens.

I made it pretty much as read with the following substitutions:  butter instead of ghee, 1/2 tbsp powdered ginger instead of fresh, can of lite coconut milk instead of the half and half.  I also doubled the kidney beans, added a few cloves of minced garlic in with the onions, added a tsp or two of garam masala in with the curry plus a little salt, and used way more greens - probably 1 bunch mustard greens, and 2 bunches kale (and could have used a bunch or two more).  Turned out fantastic!  Serve over basmati rice.

This was very good! I used collard greens because that was what I had.. Very yummy. I was afraid that it would taste a lot like Palak, but it really didn't. It has an Indian flavor, and you could defiantly add Garam Masala, etc, for a more 'authentic' taste, but it's just as good the way it is. Thank you!

This is very good, easy, and versatile.  Like others, I subbed coconut milk and added more spice.  Used diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  Over rice, it is a such a great quick meal that doesn't taste like you rushed it.

I actually think this dish looks delicious with it's greens, reds and oranges:) I increased the spice in this because I like it that way and made with evaporated goats milk. Next time I may try coconut milk instead. I wouldn't skip on the ghee if I were you because it really does give it a rich flavor.

Versatile--I, too, substituted plain nonfat yogurt, onion, and olive oil in the recipe.  Very flavorful and filling!  A great way to eat greens, with no bitterness.

Just made this tonight and it was wonderful. The recipe said "one bunch of mustard greens". But I bought a bag of mustard greens and I just put in a lot of mustard greens and it didn't matter. I am Indian and totally relate to the recipe. It was flavorful and on top of rice it was delicious. Very flavorful and super healthy. Instead of "ghee", I used Olive oil. I also used non-fat half and half. I would definitely make it again.

This is one of my fav recipes from this website! I chose this for my first time making Mustard Greens. It was manageable and delicious. My tween daughter and I love it! 

I also used olive oil and soy yogurt which worked out wonderfully, and learned from my first attempt that it was better to chop the greens before boiling.

I loved loved loved this recipe~ I added more red pepper, used condensed fat free milk rather than half and half. I added half a ring of turkey smoked sausage~ Served over brown rice- Absolutely INCREDIBLE!

This was such an easy and delicious recipe!  I didn't have any shallots or onions so I just added a couple of cloves of garlic.  I also substituted olive oil for the ghee and  pinto beans for the kidney beans.  What a versatile recipe!  It was wonderful and tasted as if I had slaved over the stove for an hour and a half when the whole thing took about 30minutes from start to finish.

I used frozen mustard greens, onions instead of the shallots, and fat-free yogurt (per another reviewer's suggestion) instead of heavy cream.  It was still a wonderful side dish...full of flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Picked free mustard greens which I've never before liked today.  This recipe was wonderful with NO trace of bitterness from the greens.  I'm going to make up a batch and try to freeze it for later.  Super easy to make.

I've never had mustard greens before but wanted to give them a try. I did not like this at all and my husband wouldn't even try it. Still I gave it 3 stars because it is easy to prepare and I'm thinking that I probably just don't like mustard greens! The sauce was ok though.

A friend gave me some mustard greens from her garden, which I had never eaten. My version of this recipe because of healthy personal preferences: coconut oil instead of butter, fresh roma tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, dried red kidney beans instead of canned and coconut milk instead of half and half, which complements the curry very well. I went a bit overboard with the pepper flakes but adding more beans took care it the extra heat. Creamy and delicious!!! We'll be eating it over jasmine rice to enjoy the sauce.

3.5 stars. Good recipe but a little bland. Added tamari and a little more ginger. Trying to not cook with oil products so used water to sauté. In lieu of 1/2 and 1/2 I blended equal parts cashews with water. I also cut the veggies down. Overall good recipe. I might add some more Indian spices after it sits for a day.

This was my first time using mustard greens and I will never buy them again. (It was a mistake in the first place.) The greens are so bitter you can't eat the dish. The sauce and beans are good, so maybe another type of green would be better.

Loved this.    I had kale and swiss chard in my garden, so substituted with a mix of both for the mustard greens.    This is a very satisfying dish that would appeal to vegetarians or meat-eaters.   Hearty dish.

Very Good...  Used fresh mustard greens from my neighbor's garden. Took other reviewer's advice:
I just threw the greens in the large skillet after everything else without pre-boiling.  Also used yogurt vs. 1/2&1/2.  Both suggestions worked great!!!

I had a can of mustard greens and was looking for a healthy and flavorful recipe--which is what I found in this recipe.  Like another reviewer, I used plain yogurt instead of half and half, and the results were great.  I warmed up some of the leftovers and had it over an omlet this morning--delicious!

This dish was amazing. I think they need to be cooked a little longer than stated in the recipe and I didn't chop them up well enough. Next time I will chop much finer but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic.

Great recipe! I was clueless about what to do with the mustard greens in my CSA box. I subbed coconut milk for the half and half since that's what I had. This is a warm and flavorful curry dish that will get me to eat those good-for-you greens.

Used coconut milk- but I think that the recipe calls for too much tomato sauce for my taste.  Served over rice and it made a TON.  Pretty good overall.

I have made this 3 times in the last month and it has turned out great each time.  The first time I used coconut milk. The second time I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 to make it even more low fat.  I serve it with brown rice as well.  Definitely a keeper.

First off, it definitely doesn't look all that appetizing. I also subbed coconut milk which gives it a great smell to me...but I'm not sure yet if my family will eat it.  I also had to add some salt as it tasted bland to me.  Will try as one reviewer said to serve this over brown rice today, with roasted sweet potatoes on the side and see how it goes.  I usually can eat just about anything so I wonder if I'm just weirded out by the combination of ingredients??

This was the first time my kids ate anything with curry in it, and they loved it.  The dish is delicious, nutrious, has just the right amount of kick to it, easy and quick to make - great all around.

Surprisingly delicious and wonderful! I did boil the greens for 30 min's as someone else suggested. Cannot wait to make again - thank you!

I did not like this recipe but I think it was a matter of taste, rather then the recipe itself.

i changed some stuff in this.  i added a cup (measured before cooking) brown rice and two and a half cubed chicken breasts, which i cooked with the shallots.  i added the rice with the tomato sauce etc.  i also  halved the curry powder but ended up adding a few more dashes after all was said and done.  i think this needed a little bit of salt, which i added and it improved the flavor.  it turned out really tasty, and very filling !
