Waaaay too sweet.  Made two batches and didn't like the way either turned out.  
The first with the recommended amount of ingredients and it just tasted like sugar with a hint of ginger at the end.  
In the second batch I cut the sugar by half and it was still too sweet for my taste, though I really love the sour punch of rhubarb.  With the second batch I could taste a little of the rhubarb, but it was still mostly covered by the sugar.  
If I were to make this again I would add a quarter of the sugar, and some pectin to thicken it up, it ended up more like a sauce or spread than a jam.
The ginger rhubarb combo was a great idea, though and I look forward to working with those flavors together again.

This Jam is so good. This is the first time I've ever bought or tasted rhubarb. It is tangy and the taste of ginger gives it a refreshing zip. Saving for our Thanksgiving dinner.

I doubled everything but the sugar and cooked for 45 mins to an hour to get a thicker jam consistency and got 4 half pint jars.  Love it!

Nice flavor, but a bit strong on the ginger.  Next time I will use only 2 tablespoons of fresh ginger, so more rhubarb flavor comes through.  Will definitely make again.

I make most of my jams using European recipes because they call for less sugar and no pectin. The result is a very flavorful fruit jam. So I was intrigued by this recipe, which called for four cups of fruit and only three cups of sugar, similar to the recipes I use. After reading the other reviews I decided to use a 2:1 ratio of fruit to sugar and kept the ginger and lemon as written in the recipe. I tasted the jam throughout the cooking process and added about two tablespoons of ginger (I love ginger) As the jam cooked down, the flavor of the rhubarb and ginger intensified and the end result was very pleasing! Cooking time was closer to 25 minutes, possibly due to altitude. The recipe yielded three 8 oz. jars of jam that set up nicely. Rachel, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I love it.  I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it.  It is true that it is too sweet but it is still awesome.  I will make it again with half the sugar to see how that goes but as it is it is a really tasty treat.  I got 7 half pint jars (250 ml) and a little bowl full from the double recipe.

Excellent jam, glad I read the comments first. I halved the sugar and cooked it for longer. It has a great jam consistency and my husband loves the taste.
