09/05: Love, love, love this recipe! It was so eay to make, even when I had to change it to accomodate 100 people! I made several: a few following the recipe exactly; a few with ham and swiss cheese; a few with sausage, caramelized onions, and mushrooms; and one with spinach and the caramelized mushrooms and onions.  I made them all ahead of time and let them sit in my refrigerator (always helps to have a second one!) and although transporting them wasn't easy, cooking them was!  I had to extend the time in a commercial oven because of the number I had, but other than that, they were a hit! I cooked up some sausage links on the side and also had a tray of caramelized onions and mushrooms if people wanted any on the side.  For something quick, hot, and tasty -- you cannot go wrong with this recipe!  5/3/09: If at possible, I think I might have even improved on this recipe, a family favorite at our house.  I was making this last night and discovered I was short on eggs.  What to do? I searched fridge and found ricotta cheese.  Followed the recipe exactly using Jimmy Dean Hot & Spicy sausage, some rosemary foccacia bread that had started to get a little stale, which I cubed, 4 eggs, and 1/2 cup of the ricotta cheese.  Everything else was the same.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and cooked it in the morning.  A total hit and my husband said he couldn't believe how creamy it was.  Nice change, but true to the original.

This was VERY easy and very good.  I used the basic recipe however I made a few changes.  Instead of Italian sausage I used Pepper Jack Turkey sausage that I chopped.  I also used pre sliced French bread (it was not thick sliced) and didn't cube it.  I lined a 9x13  dish w/the bread, topped w/the chopped sausage and sauteed green onions and 1/2 of the egg mix  then another layer of bread and finished w/the rest of the egg mix and topped with cheese.  The slices gave it a very pretty, uniform look and it ended up being like a stuffed, savory french toast -  YUM!  It was all gone but one piece that I ate later!  I can recommend this recipe.

Wonderful morning comfort food!  Made two versions for Christmas morning ... sausage & chedder and ham & swiss.  The ham/swiss was the overwhelming favorite!  The sausage & cheddar was good but tasted a lot like pizza.  Only modification I made to the recipe was using slightly more bread (husband's preference).  Making it again tomorrow, this time with bacon & a mix of cheddar & jack cheeses since that's what I have on hand.  Easy way to use up day-old bread.

I wanted to make this breakfast dish because I fondly remember one of my friends' mothers making it --this recipe did not disappoint.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, and did not find that it was too salty or runny, as some reviewers reported.  It was exactly what I hoped for: a very filling, comforting dish.

we made this recipe for a New Year's treat and, a treat it was!  followed the recipe as was EXCEPT instead of the bread slices, cubed...we used Marzetti Garlic & Butter flavored Caesar Croutons & it was delicious!  this is definitely a keeper and oh, so easy! 
the other difference; we used an 8 x 8 baking dish instead of the 7 x 11...was perfect!

Very good. I suggest adding sauteed onions, subbing seasoning salt for salt, adding pepper. Also, hubby likes the addition of mushrooms and peppers. To accomplish that I split the mixture up to two 8x8 pans. Thank you.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I used whole slices of bread instead of cubing them, and substituted turkey ham.

Really easy to make and tasted great, but I thought it was a tad salty - not sure if it depends on the sausage you use or if it always tastes like this.  My husband loved it and didn't mind the salty flavor at all.

Mom made this for Christmas Eve dinner for years before she died, my brother made it this year and all the kids/grandkids raced for the pan.
People on this site crack me up by saying "this recipe is great! I added, deleted, changed, etc." and then tell us how good theirs was. Why can't you just make it and rate it? When you change everything it isn't the same recipe, people!

This dish should be called "Drive Your Mother-in-Law Crazy". My MiL never willingly compliments anyone else's cooking as she believes she's the only one who knows how.  I prepared this for an in-laws get together breakfast and my brother-in-laws and their wives, hubby, father-in-law, and nephews couldn't stop raving.  I saw my MIL's face pucker in pain when my hubby's brothers (all three of them) asked for the recipe.  My hubby warned me I may want to watch my back for now on.  By the way, I changed nothing in the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe, but needs a few modifications to be 5 stars. I highly suggest adding some veggies with the sausage. We prefer sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions, and a coarsely chopped and seeded tomato for some color on the top layer. If using a deeper dish, I suggest layering your ingredients over the bread base: layer 1/2 sausage, mushroom & onion mixture, 1/2 cheese, then 1/2 of the egg mix. Repeat ending with your remaining egg mixture. Our favorite veggie version includes sautéed spinach, mushrooms, caramelized onions and a 2:1 mixture of gruyere and fresh shredded parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. I also reduce my milk in this recipe slightly, to avoid soggy strata bottoms/middles. I use an extra large (15x10x2") Pyrex dish, which requires 10 - 12 eggs but only 2 1/2 cups of milk. This is a great recipe and we make a variation for every brunch!

I have been making this recipe for years, and it's always gobbled up!  I double all ingredients EXCEPT sausage and salt for a 9x13 disposable foil pan and bake about 1.5 hours at 325.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and got raves from my hubby. I froze some for future quick breakfasts. I'm happy to report that this does freeze well and doesn't get mushy when defrosted and microwaved. I'd happily recommend this recipe to anyone looking for something a little different for breakfast. :0)

Great starter recipe!  I added red and green bell pepper and onion to the sausage.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper, garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper to the egg-milk mixture.  I used old french bread which held up nicely.  Lastly, I only had a 9X13 pan-it cooked perfectly for 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I make this all the time except I use frozen home fries in place of the bread. I put the taters on the bottom then the sausage and then I pour the egg, onion and green pepper mixture on top cover that with cheese and bake. Dlish!!!!

I made several of these for a huge holiday brunch.  I used sausage in two of them, ham in two, and a smaller vegetarian version.  They were the hit of the party!  Very simple to make and very tasty, too!  I will be using this recipe again.

I call this the Christmas casserole because I've served it for several years on Christmas morning. I follow this recipe exactly. The first few times I made it, I used a 9x13 dish, but last year I used a new dish much closer to the 7x11 specified here. The difference was amazing! In the 9x13, the strata was thin and seemed rather dry after baking (but still delicious). In the smaller dish, the strata was deeper and turned out much "creamier." My husband thought I had changed the recipe because he said it was so much better!

Fabulous!!  I scaled the recipe to serve 12 and baked in 9X12 pan for the same amount of time listed in the recipe & it was perfect!  You might want to cut back on the salt a little bit if using leftover ham.  I also substituted 1/2 of the cheddar with swiss.  Even the kids liked it.  A real keeper!

I give this 5 stars since I've made it before.  What gets me are the ones who "rate" the recipes telling how they changed it.

Even worse are the ones who haven't even tried a recipe and dissed it!

After being treated to this dish a few times by a very generous co-worker bringing it in to celebrate various events, I finally made one myself and DARN IT, it is SO EASY and delicious. Jimmy Dean has a bag of pre-cooked, pre-crumbled sausage bits which cuts down on the preparation even more so (and cuts down on the dishes!). I didn't even cube the bread, I just layered it on the bottom, no difference! Next time I'm definitely trying nicely seasoned croutons (Texas Toast brand are AMAZING!) and maybe changing up the meat/cheese combo. Thank you LISAJANI for this one! =D

I made this for Easter brunch today. 
Happy Easter everyone!  This was a huge hit!   I made it the night before, I used a half a large loaf of French bread, , from Market Basket's Bakery for the bread, had it sliced, then tore into pieces.  I used the pork Sausage and took it out of the casings and scrambled before adding it. I tasted the sausage after it was cooked and it was very salty so I omitted the salt in the recipe, after reading other reviewers saying it could be too salty. I was worried that it might be too salty but it tasted great! The only other change I made was I added sauteed mushrooms I highly recommend this recipe.

I use turkey or chicken sausage because I don't eat pork and it was fantastic.  One time I used a chicken sausage that was made with apples and OH MY!  Heaven!  Thanks for the great "easy" recipe!

Sorry to the poster but this is the most pedestrian recipe that I have tried. I can't even imagine how so many rated this highly. Yes it is easy to assemble and can be done the night before. It will also work to keep the masses out of your kitchen in the morning when you are cooking but that is where the benefits end. I did not care for the texture of the eggs. It is kind of bubbly from the moisture in the milk boiling. The bread gives this a kind of gummy texture, like french toast that isn't browned, and it tastes about the same. Not sure that the mustard adds anything, it is lost in the strength of the sausage & cheese.   Maybe if you used cream, left the bread out, and put buttered bread crumbs on top to brow. On second thought, I think I will stick to Quiche.

My sistern-in-law made this for a family gathering - it was fabulous.  We inhaled it. She used cut up honey baked ham instead of sausage.  Really impressive and excellent.

Perhaps this was just not to our tastes, but no one in our family liked this at all. I just could not face eating it again.  I'm not sure why because my family eats all of the ingredients in this recipe regularly, but put together?  No one was a fan.  I made this as a trial run for our Easter brunch and I'm very glad I tried this before serving it to a large group. Sorry.

This was way too salty, and I even used broccoli instead of sausage.  If I had used sausage, I don't know if I would have been able to eat it.  Otherwise the recipe worked well and was easy, so I'd suggest using half the amount of salt.

I used turkey sausage, egg beaters, fat free milk and 4 pieces of low calorie wheat with reduced fat shredded cheese..I also used crushed red pepper flakes.. Very tasty, but low calorie and fat!

I've  made this for years.  Like another said, if you didn't know this had bread in it, you would never know it was there.  I have found this to be a great thing to make when I'm feeding a crowd or have overnight company.  I make it the night before, put in the fridge.  In the morning all I have to do is put it in the oven & make the coffee and breakfast is done!  It can't be any easier than that!

I have made this many times and have changed/added ingredients...  I use dehydrated hash browns instead of bread and I add onion; on occasion I will use bacon instead of sausage and add chilis.... this is an excellent recipe.  I work at a B & B and the guests love it...  also I might add I have made and one set overnite... I put in the freezer for use at a later date..  it worked well and could not taste the difference....  enjoy

I bet if you follow this recipe exactly, it would be good.  Unfortunately, due to food allergies, I had to alter.  I used leftover onion sandwich rolls, soy based products (milk, cheese and meat) and added broccoli.  It was ok.  Again, probably great with the 'real' stuff.

This was REALLY good with the modification from another review - add about 1/2 cup ricotta cheese to make it rich and creamy. Also put in a smaller pan for thicker casserole and definitely reduce or delete the salt! Also fantastic with some green chiles - up to 1/2 cup, depending on their heat! The Sunday school class loved it!

I love this recipe!  To the person that is concerned about the bread tasting soggy, don't worry.  If you didn't know the recipe contained bread, you wouldn't know it from the taste.  You can add your own additional ingredients to this, like sauteed onions, hash browns and red peppers.  Delicious!

Delicious! I made 3 different options. From reading the other posts I made some changes. The first was sausage I added camelized onions.  I then did the next with ham, sauteed mushrooms, carmelized onions and swiss and cheddar. The third was mushroom, and 4 cheeses adding Ricotta as suggested, cheddar swiss and mozzarella. All three were great, but the sausage was the most popular. Thanks for the inspiration!

This was a big hit for a baby shower I cooked for.  I made one with sausage, sauted onions, and cheddar, one with ham and mozz cheese, and one with hamburger (cooked with taco seasoning) and cheddar.  I topped the taco one with black olives and had a dish of salsa available for topping individual servings.  Lots of compliments!

Delicious AND easy!  This is coming from someone who doesn't really like eggs.  I make this every time I host a brunch.  BUT, don't forget to read the recipe in advance!  You have to remove it from the fridge 1/2 hour before you bake it, and it bakes for a good long while.

This was pretty good- it definitely made a lot! I didn't have any dry mustard- which I found out later is a key ingredient. Do not leave out the mustard! Overall, I would make this again, but only if I'm expecting a crowd for breakfast.

This is delicious. I used 3/4 lb of sausage (1 lb was too much). I also followed the advice of adding mushrooms and spring onions and covering with tin foil for the first 35 min. Will definitely make again.

We have been making this recipe every Christmas for the past 10 years.  In the morning, we put it in the oven and then open presents.  Breakfast is ready when we're done opening gifts.  We add two more eggs and 2 more slices of bread when using a 9 x 13 pan.

Because of how simply easy and the low amount of ingredients I gave this a 5. My family just never likes these things and I just was not at all hungry so it didn't go over well, but wasn't the recipes fault. People that love stratas would probably give it a five also.

I used this as a base recipe. I used croutons to cover bottom of pan instead of bread..foccacia croutons from Costco.  I used pepper jack cheese for cheese.  8 eggs and 1 1/4 cups milk.  No salt.  Very good casserole!  Everyone at work loved it!

This was pretty good but I found it to be a little too salty. Next time I will omit the added salt to see if it helps at all. UPDATE: I made this again without the extra salt for Christmas morning and it was much better. To be extra sinful, serve with some maple syrup on top. It cuts the salty taste and gives it a little somethin extra ;)

This was an easy recipe and turned out great!  The only thing I would add is perhaps some mushrooms/spinach.  I used sage sausage which gave it more flavor.  Also, next time I would let the bread sit out a day to dry out.

I have made this twice within two weeks for work.  I made it the first time and they loved it so much they requested it again.  This is so easy and so good.  I used sliced bread the first time and the second time I used french bread...so much better.   I topped with crumbled bacon before I put in the oven and used sage sausage..Made it for 12 servings in a 9x13 for about 55min.  Yummy!!!!!

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  I was nervous to make this for a Bridal Shower without having tried it out first, but I had no reason to worry!  I received so many compliments on it and several requests for the recipe.  I made this in a 9 x 13 pan so I increased the recipe to fit that.  The only thing I did differently was use whole slices of bread instead of cubing them.  Once it was put together, I covered it in plastic wrap and pushed down on it to make sure everything was fully submerged.  I didn't add or omit any of the ingredients and I don't think I will next time.  It was that good.

Yum, yum, yum!  Tweaked the recipe just a bit.  Doubled the recipe.  Instead of pork sausage, I substituted turkey sausage.  Also added carmelized onions and mushrooms.  It did take over 1:15 to cook..but it was worth the wait.  So light and fluffy.  This was perfect for brunch!

I am not known for my cooking at all, but I served this at a brunch and EVERYONE LOVED it and wanted the recipe!  I made 3 small alterations - I used seasonsed restaurant style croutons instead of cubing bread (cuz I'm lazy), Jimmy Dean mild and spicy sausage, and mild and sharp cheese.  I will make this again and again!

This is a very easy, yet satisfying breakfast or brunch dish.  It is very simple to change it up by using stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and adding additional items such as asparagus, peppers, onions, garlic, or whatever you like.  I have used this basic recipe for years and changed it up many different ways...always getting rave reviews.

I have made this recipe for a number of years.  I add mushrooms, green peppers and onions to mine.  I saute the vegetables first.  Everyone in my family loves it.  I have also found using half and half instead of milk, makes it firmer and less runny.

Excellent breakfast/brunch idea.  I have made this recipe in every size pan, doubled and tripled it, made ahead by as much as a week, and put cooked portions in the freezer for later.  It is never bad.

AMAZING!!  I left bread out over night, and made this the night before. I added bell pepper and onions, and sautéed until translucent.  layer bread in the bottom, sausage, then onions and peppers, and cheese on top.  Then pour egg over all! I had to cook about 15 minutes longer in a non convection oven.

So easy and tasty! Big hit at work.  I made 3 11" x 7" trays to bring to the office. I used about 8 eggs for each pan, 2 1/4 cups of milk, added chopped and sautéed onions and red peppers as well as some raw spinach for color. I did use French bread, but I just tore it in pieces and covered the bottom of the pan so that it would be easy to spoon out and that worked really well. I made one that was ground sausage (ended up not using the whole pound), one with ham (only needed 1/2 pound of diced ham), and one with just veggies/cheese. I accidentally forgot the salt and mustard because I was so excited to get everything in the pans, but it still came out quite tasty. I will add those ingredients next time to compare. My 3 trays took about 1 hour 15 minutes to bake, but that could have been due to the fact that there were 3 in my oven. Will definitely be making again!

This recipe is SOOO easy to make and I love that you can throw everything together the night before and in the morning just pop it in the oven while you're getting ready for work, etc. I will say I was unsure about the mustard in a breakfast dish. However, I couldn't hardly even taste it. I guess it just adds a tiny bit of zip. But you can definitely modify this recipe to your tastes. I think next time I will throw in some green peppers and mushrooms or onions. This is good as is, but another dimension of flavors would make it great!

I used a round loaf of sour dough bread and cut into cubes.  It added great flavor and since the bread is more dense, was not mushy!

I'm giving the recipe five stars even though I didn't follow it exactly. I wondered how it would come out if I didn't let it sit for eight hours before baking so I decided to bake it right after combining all the ingredients. It was good but I think it'll be better next time if I let it sit overnight. I also added onions and green bell peppers.

I used egg beaters, skim milk and 50% reduced fat cheddar cheese to make a lowfat version and my guests still raved about it. I also sauteed onions and mushrooms in olive oil to make it heart healthy.

Great recipe, simple, basic. I cut it down by 1/3. The quality of the ingredients can make all the difference though. We had excellent breakfast sausage and that's what really made it.

This recipe is excellent as is.  I have made it several times.  The last time I added 1/2 cup of fresh chopped onion to the sausage while it was frying and topped it with one can of Cream of Mushroom soup just before baking.  Yummy!

I make this often, whenever I'm planning a brunch for family/friends! I have made different versions at times, adding different veggies I had on hand, but this basic recipe is great. I always use the maple sausage and it's fantastic. I've also tried different types of cheese - use whatever you really like and it will turn out great! I've used different types of bread too, and will say I think the best was the french bread. I like it uneven, so I always cube my bread, but think it would be good if you skipped that step too. Thanks for the recipe!

When I told my family we were having strata for Christmas breakfast they were very skeptical (it's not part of the tradition).  We now have a new, delicious tradition!  I added sautéed mushrooms and onions to the layer of sausage, and increased the eggs to 8. I also made a second dish using vegan sausage for my vegetarian daughter. Yum!

My family liked this breakfast casserole.  I liked that I made it up the day ahead.  The only change I made was the cheese - used co-jack as that is what I had on hand.  Heated up great as leftovers the next morning.  Thanks Lisajani for sharing.

This was very simple to make! tasted great the first day, but even better the next morning. I would def. add some color to the recipe. I added sauted red and green peppers to mine. Next time I plan to use a lot less sausage. overall its a great easy recipe that I will be making again.

This is an excellent breakfast or lunch meal.  I am typically not crazy about the blandness of the bread portion of the meal so I tried adding a tsp of rubbed sage and some canned, diced green chilies to the egg mixture.  Also, I found that white bread is good but sourdough french bread worked even better.

I used ham instead of sausage and it was great. I also baked it in a 9x13 inch pan and it turned out fine. Very good and easy recipe!

Easy and delicious! Taking comments from both this recipe and the Christmas Breakfast Sausage Casserole recipe, I used 12 eggs, 2# sage sausage, 2C half & half, 1 C milk, 16oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 2t mustard and 2 boxes of Marie Callendar's Garlic & Cheesse Croutons. I omitted the salt and combined everything in a large bowl. This mixture made enough to fill a 10" x 15" pan and a smaller baking dish for later! Only found it necessary to bake covered for 45 minutes and then uncover, bake for an additional 15 minutes, then sprinkle extra cheese on top for 15 minutes longer. VIOLA!

This was very good!  I used bacon instead of sausage because that is my meat of choice.  I used just 1/2 teaspoon of salt and that was plenty, and added a little black pepper, also, I served it over hash browns.  Family really liked it.

VERY GOOD, but too salty.  Cut the salt in half or leave out all together.

This recipe is fantastic!  My guests at Easter raved about this dish.  It's very quick and easy and all you have to do is throw it in the oven the next day.  I used diced ham on the top and it was fantastic!

This is a really good recipe! I DID make a few changes, though, LOLz! Instead of cubing the bread, I left the slices whole. I also substituted cinnamon for the salt and nutmeg for the dried mustard. I also left out the cheese and sausage, because I didn't have any on hand. Finally, instead of baking it in the oven, I just dipped each piece of bread in the egg mixture and individually cooked each slice of bread in a skillet. I thought it tasted a lot like french toast. My fam. TOTALLY loved it! I give this recipe five stars with my changes.

5 stars for this bad boy.  I made it as written and it is wonderful.  I also made this with onions, peppers and mushrooms, also wonderful.  I made this one and cut it into portion size pieces which I wrapped and froze.  I can then have a piece which I nuke anytime I am in the mood.  So easy and good.  Thanks so much.

this was really good. i only had wheat bread so i used that...i will probably just go to the store next time and get white bread though. but it was still good. added some onions with the sausage when it was cooking...im still kind of a new cook so it was fun to ready all the reviews and see the different things all the great cooks did. next time i think i will use italian bread, ham, swiss cheese, spinach and mushrooms! :) mmmm!!

Just the recipe base I was looking for.  Perfect for some stale wheat sandwich bread I found in the freezer.  Cut bread into cubes while frozen makes it very easy.  I used link sausage (removed from casings) because that's what I had on hand.  This dish was a big hit at work, baked in a foil 11x7 pan and no clean-up.  I can see all kinds of possibilities for variations in the future, but you really can't go wrong with the basic recipe either.

I made this and everyone seemed to like it!  I did tweak it a bit as follows:  I used the sage flavored pork sausage, 6 oz. of leftover cubed hamburger buns, the cheddar, 7 eggs instead of 6, half and half instead of milk, 1/2 t. salt, the ground mustard and a pinch or two of cayenne pepper.  I also sautéed 3-4 sliced green onions and one minced clove of garlic in 1/2 T. butter and added that to the egg mixture.  Mine baked up beautifully and tested done after 40-45 minutes.  This is a great basic recipe that you can change up to your liking.  I’m sure I’ll be making this one again!

This recipe has become a holiday breakfast tradition in our home.  It makes Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas mornings so much nicer!  I prepare the night before and all I need to do in the morning is bake it.  If I were to make a change to this recipe, I might add some sauteed peppers and onions.

I made this recipe last night and baked it this morning.  I needed enough for 12 ladies, so I increased the ingrediants by 50% and baked it in a 9x13 glass baking dish, using 1 lb. bulk Mild Italian sausage and 1/2 lb. spicy Italian sausage, sauted with l medium yellow onion, chopped. Instead of white bread, I used 8 slices of dense whole-wheat bread and did not trim off the crusts, and I added sliced black olives. I used sharp cheddar cheese and served fresh salsa as an availale topping. The recipe was very well received!

I've used this combination as a make-ahead breakfast casserole for years. FYI: for those who are GLUTEN intolerant, you can use rice cakes instead of bread on the bottom of the dish -- spraying the dish first with Pam or some equivalent. After being in the refrigerator overnight and baking it the next morning, you can't tell that there were rice cakes instead of bread on the bottom. I made this once for a weekend beach getaway. Everyone enjoyed it, even those who weren't gluten intolerant. Very EASY.

I have been making this for over 20 years.We call it Christmas Morning Souffle because we place in oven when everyone gets up and around the  Christmas tree and in 60 minutes, we are having a hot breakfast with no cooking because we made it the day before. I do use half & half instead of milk and everyone looks forward to it every Christmas!

Excellent! I made this in an 8x8 pan. I used white hot dog buns (3 of them) for the bread, only 4 eggs, and subbed 1 cup buttermilk for the milk. The bottom was fluffy, and the smell of maple sausage was amazing as it baked.

This was delicious but I agree with some of the other reviews that adding other ingredients such as mushrooms would be great additional flavor to this otherwise bordline bland dish.  The cheese topping was wonderful, getting crispy and crunchy at the edges YUM!  I used sage flavored Jimmy Dean sausage and omitted the ground mustard. You MUST do this! It's wonderful and easy. I also browned the sausage until it was pretty crispy, it adds so much flavor and is what I do with the sausage I use in my chili recipe as well!  I topped it off with fresh ground black pepper to bring it all together. I loved it, my husband loved it, I'm keeping this in the recipe box(with my own alterations of course)

I needed a little more for our group, so I used 12 eggs and 8 slices of Texas toast, keeping the milk amount the same. I also left out the salt, used sage sausage, added 2 tsp. of white pepper and 1 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to the egg mixture (for a little kick that our family likes). Lastly, I browned 1/4 pound of bacon which I crumbled on the top of the strata before cooking. It was a hit with everyone at our Christmas brunch. Thanks!

This recipe was really easy to make and tasted great! I made a few changes only due to not having the exact ingredients on hand.  We never have real eggs on hand (we always use Egg Starts from Costco) so I used the egg start equivalant for the 6 eggs it called for.  We also use multi-grain bread all the time so I used that rather than just plain white bread.  I think that the bread added a lot to the recipe since it had sunflower seeds in it, it added some extra texture to an overall mushy dish.  I don't mean mushy in a bad way though, I think the texture was just how I envisioned it.  I also added some turkey bacon to the recipe as I had it on hand and who doesn't like a little bacon added to a meal? I added some slices of pepperjack cheese for a little kick and when all was said and done it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had! My boyfriend's dad was visiting us which was the main reason I made it.  He's supposedly a very picky eater according to his son, his wife and him himself, but he ate it to the surprise of everyone.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  My mother-in-law has been making something like this for years and I've always tried to duplicate it but never been successful.  This recipe was it!  I only had 1/2 lb of sausage so I also added some bacon as well and that was really good!  I baked it in a 13x9 casserole (make sure you grease it really well) covered with foil for half of the baking time to keep it moist.  Also, I didn't have time the night before to put it together so I just let it sit on the counter for about 15 min.  It worked perfect!

I made this recipe for a brunch with my grandparents.  Even my grandpa, who only likes my grandma's cooking, praised it.  It was easy and delicious!  The only thing I changed was toasting the bread before cubing it, so that it stands up a little better to the eggs; and I combined jack and cheddar cheese.

I served this strata for our family Easter brunch, and it was a big hit!  My daughter-in-law asked for the recipe.  I scaled it to serve 12 and baked it for about 60 min. in a 13x9 pan.  I did use part half and half and part milk as someone suggested.  It is important to let it sit for about 10-15 min. before serving.  The few leftovers reheated nicely in microwave the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fabulous egg casserole dish.  I tried this for a dinner with fried potatoes and melon and it was a hit.  Very moist and creamy tasting.  You can not go wrong with this.  I'm making this for a big bridal brunch shower.  Two Thumbs Up.

needed to cook about 20 min longer than suggested or bread will be too soggy.  Other than that my family loved it.

Make it the same morning and skip the overnight soak. Just mix the bread, milk, eggs and dry mustard together then let them sit for a few minutes. Then mix the sausage and cheese in. An hour is too long when you do it this way. Turn the oven up to 375 and bake for 35 minutes on center rack. Browns beautifully.

Very good! (I didn't use the mustard.  I will try it next time.)  This is the perfect dish for company.  Easy to make and everything all in one dish.  I used an 8X8 pan.  Make again!

This is a great way to feed a crowd in the AM w/o a lot of fuss. I did not make the recipe exactly as described, but I do like more "additives".  I used crumbled bacon instead of sausage, and added sauteed mushroom and onions and sun-dried tomatoes. I did try to make sure the additives did not add too much water.  I have varied this numerous times-always easy and tasty!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Had surpise elves spending Chistmas morning with us.  A quick trip to the market for sage sausage, large herb seasoned croutons and some sharp cheddar cheese. Added  some chopped, butter sauteed veggies from the bin ( 1/2 green pepper, a couple  of small onions, and 1/2 pound mushrooms) to the drained, cooked sausage. Baked covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes. I let the casserole  stand for 10 minutes. I cut into squares and served with a good salsa and sour cream. A couple of tangerine "cuties" and a few Xmas cookies filled up the plate. All were happy, full and ready to open presents. I will definitely make again but may play around with the dairy, sausage and cheese options. Unlimited possibilities for limitless occassions. Happy Holudays all!

My grandfather made this for Easter breakfast for the last 15 years. Although, his had an added 1 tbs of onion soup mix in it. This year we made it in his memory. We've always loved this one. We'll keep making this one for generations.

I followed this recipe to the letter other than adding pepper.   I found the flavors came together nicely.  Only think I might do different next time is put the cheese on top after 20 minutes of cooking, it was a little hard but still very good.

I always add whatever veggies I have on hand, spinach, onions, mushrooms, peppers, broccoli.  Be sure to cook the veggies some first otherwise they add too much moisture and the strata will take longer to cook.

This was really good. I used plain old white bread because that's all we had - I think it would be a lot better with a crustier, more seasoned bread. Next time I will try a french baguette bread that is pre-seasoned. I also did not refrigerate - I'm not sure what benefit this would provide. It turned out fine without the refrigeration.

I used sliced bagette from the grocery store day old shelf. It was already sliced thin, and therefore pretty dry. It worked great. For one pan I cut the slices into fourths, and I think the consistency when baked was better, those smaller pieces "puffed" even better than the slices. I got the sausage really brown which looked so appealing when the final dish came out of the oven. I used a tube of spicy suasage, sliced into rounds. When the sausage was done I cut the rounds into six pieces so no knives would be required at brunch. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about three hours before baking. It took an hour to bake. Everyone lived it, big hit.

I use this recipe every Christmas morning. I have gotten a more souffle-like result by covering it for 40 minutes and uncovering it for 15. I alternate red & green bell pepper rings on top to make it more festive and add a little extra flavor. It bakes and rests while we open gifts. Delicious!

Made this for my parents for when they stayed from out of town and it was a big hit.  My 5 year old son had 3 helpings!  Simple and VERY yummy - what could be better!  I did add more meat to it but it is simple to add whatever you would like!  Give it a whirl you will love it - thanks for sharing!!!

Very delicious. I am a vegetarian so I did not do the sausage and just added some spinach to the egg. When it came out of the oven I sprinkled a little extra cheese on top. Everyone loved it and it was just as good reheated the next day. Don't know if with the sausage it would be as good reheated but without it, it was perfect. Made again last night for today.

Always a hit. In a pinch I put it in the fridge whatever time I have - even if it's just an hour. A great kitchen cabinet recipe...add some type of meat, some type of cheese, and some veggie and it's good to go.

I prepared this Christmas Eve and popped it in the oven Christmas morning letting it cook while we opened packages.  I will do this again next year!  I made one change:  I put frozen cube cut hash browns in the bottom of the pan instead of bread.  The dish was still very good.  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the cheese made it a little too greasy for me.  I'll cut back next time.  Also, it's a great way to use up some of that left over ham.

A good start, but I adjusted it in several ways.  After reading the comments about salt, I cut it down to 1/2 teaspoon. Even that was a bit much. Also, I found all that sausage made a very heavy dish, so I substituted mushrooms for 1/4 lb of the sausage (cooking them together). Finally, I used half white and half whole wheat bread.   This resulted in a dish that got a number of requests for the recipe!

We made a few pans of these for a Girl Scout party, and most of the girls loved it. I like this one because when you are making it for children it's just nice and simple, no "green things" that they won't eat. When I make it for my own family, in spite of my picky eaters, I like to add mushrooms and peppers. Yum!

I too have been making this recipe for years, frequently for Christmas morning, but I use herb seasoned stuffing mix as the bread base, and then add whatever else I need to get rid of that is in the frig!  Never fails to be a hit.  Just be careful not to use too much of the seasoned dry bread cubes.  They really soak up the eggs.

I made this for New Year's Day brunch.  We had a couple people with health concerns so I used about 3 oz deli ham instead of the sausage and then cut the cheese down to just enough to sprinkle over the top (about 2-3 oz).  I also added a sprinkle of minced onion instead of the salt.

I got rave reviews!!

Easy, hearty, and delicious!  A great way to use up stale bread.  I added about half a yellow onion, diced, to the skillet and cooked with a pinch of salt until soft and translucent before browning the sausage.  The onion was a great addition.

Okay maybe I'm not a Strata person but this turned out horrible. The eggs would not cook all the way and when I left it in longer..everything burnt!! It might have been me and not the recipe..don't know!

Fantastic! I did change it a little, though.First, I cut it back to serve 2 poeple. Then I used a couple of English muffins that had been in the fridge for about a week.  Sine I had some bacon and no sausage, I used the bacon . Then I sauteed onions and fresh mushrooms in the drippings. Also added frozen, thawed chopped spinach layered with the veggies. Changed the cheese to a mixture 
of Montery Jack and Fontina cheeses.
About 15 min before it was done I sprinkled 1/2 chopped plum tomato and Parmesan over the top for color.
 It really wasn't very much like the original, but it sure tasted good. I agree with other reviewers in that it tastes even better the second day.

This is a very reliable recipe.  Having made it several times now, I'd agree with suggestions to leave out the salt.  I tend to add about 4 more eggs than called for as well.  When serving vegetarians, I'll stir-fry peppers and asparagus and toss those in instead of the sausage, and in that case throw in salt and more pepper and some Herbes de Provence to give it a little more "oomph".

I really enjoyed this strata! I used a combo of Fontina and Monterey Jack instead of cheddar cheese. I cubed a half dozen of day old , small crusty rolls (Portugese rolls)in place of the sliced bread. This recipe reheats very well...actually I think it was better the day after! I drizzled a little bit of maple syrup over it. It's not just for breakfast...very satisfying!

My hubby raved about this! For such a simple dish, it really is tasty. Here are the only changes I made: I only had half pound of sausage, and frankly, it was plenty; added 3 pieces of cooked & crumbled bacon; did not add the salt--there was plenty in the cheese & the sausage; like brwneyedchef, I sauteed the sausage with some onion; finally, I sprinkled dill weed over the top before refrigerating. I only had 6 hours to refrigerate, but it worked just fine. Very, very good recipe and one I will certainly use again, especially for overnight guests.

I added mushrooms and onions w/ the sausage.  This turned out great and was easy to make.  It took just a bit longer to bake though in an 8x8 glass casserole dish for an hour and 10 minutes.

Made this for Christmas breakfast and it turned out great! I might keep some cheese to sprinkle on top next time, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

The second time I made this I added green chiles and red bell pepper. I forgot to prep it the night before, but it was just fine fixing it in the morning.

I modified this recipe slightly. I used ham instead of sausage and I ran out of dry mustard, so used prepared dijon instead. It was FABULOUS!!!!  I took it to a MOPS meeting and there was not a 
crumb left!

We have had this recipe numerous times and everone alway enjoys it.  It is great to make ahead for overnight guests, saves so much time in the morning.  Fresh fruit is a good compliment to the dish.  I make it exactly as written.  People need to remember that the amount of salt or any seasoning is a personal taste and can be adjusted easily.

Thank you for this wonderful strata.  It made my Christmas morning breakfast a "hit" with the entire family.  Fabulous flavor!  The best part was taking it out of the fridge and tossing it in the oven.  No morning prep.  Just bake and eat.  Yahoo!!

My family has made this recipe for Christmas brunch for many years. We put the ingredients together the night before and it bakes while we open our presents. The only thing I have added over the years is green bell pepper and onion sautéed in the drippings from the sausage. Not only is this easy, but it is also delicious!

Excellent. I often get this "to make request" when I need to bring a hearty breakfast item to a meeting. At home, my kids like it too. Also, tastes great using a good turkey sausage. Unfortunately, whole wheat bread gives it a "different" taste. My recommendation is to just give in and use white bread.

Just got done eating this for breakfast. It was fabulous.  I used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage in place of the pork sausage and added a chopped onion.  I didn't want to stop eating it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was delicious!! I put in Smokies instead of Sausage, and added onions and asparagus.  I will be making this with some pepperoni bread that we can get locally.  I will also make in a 9x9 pan, as it took longer to cook in the loaf pan than the recipe stated.  Joy

It is great! Love this recipe! I did as others suggested, I sauteed
1/2 cup each of diced bell pepper, diced onion, sliced green onions,
& 1 finely diced shallot, upped the dry mustard to 1 1/2 tsp. and
lowered the milk to 1 1/2 cups (used 2%) & whisked in 3 Tbsp. reg. sour cream with the eggs--my eggs were at room temp-and I let 
the casserole sit on counter 20 minutes, then baked it at 350^ 
for 45 minutes--it was fantastic! Husband loved it-we even
ate the left overs for dinner! Recipe generously feeds 4.

In it's basic form, this recipe is GREAT breakfast food, especially when entertaining overnight guests. Pre-prepping makes for an easy morning. This recipe can be dressed up anyway you like (addition of green peppers, onions, mushrooms, bacon or different cheeses). Fun to experiment with this one 'cause if you ruin it, it won't set you back much. Try lightly covering with some diluted (w/milk) cream of mushroom soup and/or substituting boiled (el dente) potatoe cubes instead of the bread cubes. I used to call this "Beeba's Big Breakfast Bake" and watched as the sleepover kids devoured. And yes, they can help prepare it the night before. Fun, fun fun

Wonderful!  I don't eat much bread so used shredded hash browns (cooked 3/4 of the way) and did the rest exactly as the recipe says.  Mmmmmm.  And, let it sit for another day or two to let all the flavours meld together and then re-warm it (I microwaved it) ... so amazing!!!

This was super easy and delicious. I modified it a little. I used 2/3-pound of sausage, a couple sliced of ham chopped up, a squirt of prepared mustard (about a tablespoon) because I didn't have dry, and I added a touch of vanilla and dash of cinnamon on top. I will definitely make it again.

This wasn't my favorite breakfast casserole - not enough flavor? Too much bread? Not sure, but I will keep looking for a go-to recipe.

Very good...I used an 8X8 pan but would not next time.  It was a little thick.  I also didn't let it set overnight, just for a few hours, and that seemed to work!  Used turkey breakfast sausage.

This turned out great.  I would however suggest only using white bread.  I used the Homepride wheat bread that I always keep at home and it had a little too much texture for my taste.

Excellent recipe!  Just know you need to make this the night before (mine became lunch, and sat for only five hours, which worked fine). I cut the recipe in half, and used a 1-1/2 qt. casserole dish, with half a package of stuffing croutons.  Got scared after reading one of the reviews about croutons soaking up all the egg, so added a fourth egg with 1/3 cup buttermilk--it was perfect.  I added sliced mushrooms, diced onion, sweet red pepper and zucchini and a little sun-dried tomato to the sausage mixture---fabulous!  Buttermilk works as a substitute for the half and half.  This will become our new Christmas morning staple!  Thanks for this very versatile recipe.

Very good!! I used 4 slice of bread, 6 eggs, 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half. I also cooked it in a round casserole dish. Don't forget to grease the bottom of the dish! Delicious, will definatly make again! Thanks!

I just made this over the Thanksgiving weekend and it can out a bit too oily for my liking-Was it the cheddar i used or was i suppose to maybe towel blot the sausage since it sat overnight to be cooked early next morning-And i also sprayed hte pan instead of greasing it.

This was a nice change for breakfast. I also added a can of mushrooms (drained) and a chopped onion. I took the advice of another reviewer and used seasoned salt in place of regular. I want to try this again with throwing in some chopped green pepper, maybe a colby monterey jack cheese, a different kind of bread. This is a very flexible recipe. My husband, who is against all things egg, even ate it!

Very good, even the kids liked it. I added mushrooms, onions, garlic and it had a great flavor. Made it spur of the moment, so it was only refrigerated for 5 hours. Baked up fine, so don't worry if you can't let it sit for 8 hours or overnight.

Excellent,tripled the recipe,added sauteed onions, mushrooms, and a jalapeno peppers,made enough for 3 breakfasts. And froze two for later.   Also used sourdough bread and aged white cheddar.    You can mix it up with different gourmet sausages.

We made this for Mother's Day and it was delish.  I used a 9x13 pan so I added another egg and extra cheese.

I used turkey sausage and a 1 pound loaf of multi-grain bread. This actually doubles the amount of bread called for in the original recipe but it did not seem to dry to me. Even though it was a hearty multi-grain bread. (I do not like mushy, soggy stratas.) Added tobasco and some sliced green onions. I did this in a 9 x13 pan and due to time I only soaked it for about two hours. Would definitely be better with an overnight soak. This is a good and easy recipe.

So easy and tasty.  Made the night before and then I was ready for christmas morning.  Family questioned it until they tasted it and there was nothing left.  Great for brunch.

This is delicious!  I have been looking for a good strata that did not taste too "bready".  Make it the day before and pop it into the oven in the morning.  Yum!

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe and made it in an 8X8 pan.  We don't care for sausage so I put crumbled bacon and carmelized onions.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good.  I added mushrooms and onions.  I think next time I might add one more egg, and a little less bread. Very good though as is.

This was so easy and very good.  I used turkey bacon in place of the sausage.  Next time I would not add any additional salt as the bacon was salty enough.  Also, I wasn't sure whether to cook it covered or uncovered since it didn't specify.  I cooked it covered b/c I didn't want to burn the cheese and it was a bit soggy in the middle..cooked but soggy.  So next time I might uncover it for the last 15 min or so to try to firm it up a bit as my family prefers our eggs very well done.  Definately try again for company.

I make this all the time, and it's really great.  I don't care for mustard at all, so I eliminate that from the recipe.  My husband is on a low carb diet, so I use whole wheat bread instead of white.

This recipe was so easy to make and turned out great!  We have frequent brunches and this will become a staple at those get togethers.  I added raw baby spinach and mixed it in with the bread cubes.  Very flavorful

I worked for a coop that had monthly breakfast meeting for the board. The office girls took turns cooking and each time it was my turn (and sometimes when it was not) they requested this recipe. I have added bell peppers, hot sauce, sliced hot peppers, mushrooms, and used wheat bread instead of white. Just depending on what I had on hand. They loved it. I no longer work there but last month the president of the board called me and asked me if I would make it for this month's meeting - even offered to pay me!!!

I liked the recipe for its simplicity. I will definetly add some onions and pssibly mushrooms the next time though. It was slightly bland for my taste but I'm not a fan of sausage. Will probably make again and use bacon the next time. Still a great recipe.

Substituted cubed ham for the sausage, otherwise kept everything else the same.  Delicious!  Made it for overnight guests who were leaving right after breakfast.  A perfect send-off!

This is great, my husband and kids loved it. Since I keep kosher, I used vegetarian hot dogs. I suggest cutting the cheese to one cup - no more is needed, and you MUST add one large onion which you saute with the sausage/hot dogs. Thanks for a winner.

cut recipe in half and made with bacon as 

cut recipe in half and made with bacon as I didn't have sausage on hand.  It was terrific.  Had leftovers even so ( there are just two of us) and they heated up well the next morning.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for father's day brunch - one with sausage and cheddar and one with ham and swiss. Everyone LOVED them and there was hardly any left. Had to cook about 20 min longer than noted here but that night have been due to the fact that I had 2 in there together. These are simple and delicious and EASY!

Really, really good! My arteries are hardening just looking at it, but oh, oh, oh, so tasty. Pretty easy to make too. I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 milk. You just can't go wrong with sausage, eggs, and cheese. I bet bacon would be good too.

This is one of those outstanding make-the-night-before, bake-the-next-morning recipes.  This was absolutely wonderful.  I used a 9X13 pan, and baked it for one hour.  I did not let it sit out for the extra 1/2 hour before baking as the recipe called for - - we were too hungry!  I froze the leftovers for next weekend.  *****

Easy is right!  This was a breeze, and tasty too.  The only change I'll make next time is to not add all the salt.  The sausage has plenty.  This recipe is a keeper. . . thanks!

I thought this was a little too salty but I used ham which is salty anyways.  Next time I will try sausage.  My husband absolutely loved it!!

I made this for a small group (10-12)  and it was a huge hit! I used cut up sweet Italian sausage instead of the pork sausage link and I baked it in a convection oven at 350 for 45 minutes and it turned out the perfect golden brown.  It is so easy and a great dish to make for a group.

Good basic recipe. Much better if you omit the added salt and only bake for 40 min. Also, don't forget to completely drain and blot the sausage to remove all the grease. Make sure you use breakfast sausage and refrigerate overnight.

I have been making a version of this dish for years!  We made two versions of it, 1. overnight French toast and the 2) was overnight egg and sausage French toast. We served it for Christmas, Easter and at weddings the morning after. Note - it's even good cold.

This was part of my Christmas Morning brunch and it was very well received. I thought it was a bit too salty. Maybe because my sausage was already salty and adding the tsp was too much. Guests seemed to like it. I made with turkey sausage and added a small red pepper. Kept everything as written. Baked for an hour covered and then I broiled the top to get nice and brown for about 4 minutes.

This is a great recipe and I have been making it for years. It's easy to change it up with other add ins besides the sausage. Just to make it a little easier I don't cube the bread. I butter each slice and just lay it in the 9x13-inch pan. Then sprinkle the sausage over the bread, pour on the egg/milk mixture and top with the cheese.

Awesome!  I used a lb of breakfast sausage instead of Italian.  I also added layer of sautéed onions, spinach and diced sundries tomatoes.  This was the BEST strata/breakfast casserole I've EVER made from this site or any cookbook.  I like the idea of a "basic" recipe that you could adapt to your own personal taste.  Again, this was awesome, and the leftovers were even better!

I make a casserole like this but use crescent rolls as a base. Then do the rest, pour egg mix over and bake. My group for brunch loved it.

I make this every year for Christmas breakfast. I do not add the mustard as we are not fans of it. It uses a little over half a loaf of Safeway French bread. I think next year I will follow the instructions on the sausage which say to slice it before unwrapping it. My family loves this recipe.

This was delicious and super easy to make.  After reading the other reviews, I cut the salt in half and used turkey sausage as a personal preference.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.

This was one of my mom's favorite recipes - I've been using it for over 30 years - we dress it up with fancier ham or cheeses, or prepare it as shown.  One optional item on my recipe is a little chopped green pepper, and sometimes a little lightly sauteed onion.  It also reheats well. 
I've made it for large groups (100+) and it's always a hit.

Sorry but I found this dish to be tasteless and gummy.  I think the bread on the bottom was a bad idea as I thought it made the dish mushy.  The bread should have been placed on the top to brown.  I think it had to much milk and made the dish a soggy mess.  I had to remove the aluminum foil and cook 15 minutes longer to get the eggs to set.  I even used seasoned salt and I sauted an onion to try to add flavor.  No need for the dry mustard it did nothing for the dish.  Sorry for the rating but I have to be honest, hubby gave it three stars.  Will go back to my old standby breakfast.

This was delicious and extremely easy to prepare. It reheats well too! I've made this numerous times now and always get rave reviews. I always use breakfast sausage in mine (not maple flavored) and it brings it all together.

I've made this following the recipe and with different twists. My sons devoured nearly an entire 9X13 pan for supper one evening when I made this using left-over cubed kalamata olive Artisan bread, pepper bacon, and packaged Italian blend cheese (parmesan, asiago, mozarella and provolone.) Didn't change the seasoning at all. EXCELLENT!

This was so good, everyone loved it. I had leftover Italian bread soup bowls I used, and I added bacon because i was short on sausage. It came out wonderfully.

Easy to make (almost too easy!)and disappears fast! I made 2 for a baby shower - one ham and cheddar, one ham and swiss.  Both turned out great and I was asked several times for the recipe! Loved it!

I doubled the recipe and made casserole for a breakfast at church. It was great.Used mild sausage and also sauteed yellow onion in with the sausage while I was browning it. To make it for my family I will use the hot sausage as we like the spicy-kick. Great breakfast or brunch item. Will definitely make again!

This was tasty, but my husband and I both thought that we would prefer it with less sausage next time.  I will most likely reduce the sausage to half a pound or 3/4 of a pound next time.

Love this recipe.  I made it for my son's birthday party so the grown ups would have something nice to eat.  Also made a vegetarian version by using 1 box of frozen spinach, thawed and drained and gruyere cheese instead of cheddar.  Everyone at the party RAVED!  Oh, I doubled the amount of dry mustard to give it a little zip.  Really easy and yummy for a party.

This is a favorite of our's for holidays.  I don't change a thing usually.  Last time, due to what was in the kitchen, I used whole wheat bread and Dijon mustard because that's what my parents had at their house.  Still tasted great!

I followed some of GrannyLooHoo's tips and omitted the salt, sauteed onions and green pepper with the sausage, and added dill weed. I also added garlic to the egg mixture. I had some leftover marble rye and some wheat bread, so that is what I used for the bread. It was yummy. The kids loved it as well. Thanks for a good recipe

This was a great recipe!  I added chopped broccoli and onion to the top, with a sprinkle of extra cheese.  I used light pork sausage, reduced fat cheese, whole wheat bread, and added a little seasoned pepper and parsley.  I will definately keep this one!  Thanks!

They don't call this "Easy" Sausage Strata for nothin'.  I am NOT a cook (I make one thing and bring to every family gathering/potluck).  I made this for Easter Brunch and amazed my friends and family.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Yummy!

I made this for Easter brunch, adding bacon to the sausage, and served it with honeydew and mango chunks.  It was sooo good!  This will definately be repeated at my house for any and all holiday morning breakfasts!  Delicious!

Great recipe for a breakfast/brunch since you get it all ready the night before and it is really versatile.  I used a leftover baguette, cooked bacon, gruyere cheese and spinach (cooked in a little of the bacon grease).   
Note: people complain about rating a recipe 5 stars when you change it but these reviews are what makes this site so useful.   Often we don't have the exact ingredients so knowing what other people did is really helpful.

I added mushrooms and onions besides the sausage and cheese - it was fabulous!!  The flavor from the mustard is wonderful and the texture was amazing.  I will absolutely be making this again.

Since I was serving only two, I cut the recipe in half. It was easy to make and tastes great. Great idea for a large group. My grandson  came in and finished the dish.

Great recipe you can adjust per your preferences.   I use 2 cups almond milk and 1 cup of Heavy Cream  Also increase eggs using 12.  Cover for 50 mins with lid (or use alum foil), remove lid and cook 10 more minutes to thicken.  I make this dish for dinners also, we love it!

I used Jenni-O Turkey Sausage, reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese, a pinch less salt (sausage was salty enough) and added green onions. It was a hit with everyone, including me! Will definitely make again.

I wasn't crazy about this.  My hubby didn't like it at all.  I think if it had more eggs that would help.  My son really liked it but I don't think I will make it again.

We thought this was very good and very easy for a Christmas morning.  I did add a 1/2 pound of cooked bacon, which, of course, made it even better.  I think next time I might add an additional egg or two just to give it even more protein and a bit puffier.

I made this recipe as is.  At the time I only had parmesan cheese.  Great.  Next time I made it, I added garlic, green chile, and thinly sliced green onion.  YUMMY.  Thank you for an EXCELLENT recipe LISAJANI.

Easy.   I do leave out the salt when using sausage as that is salty enough.    Also, I  make it in the moment and don't leave it in the frig or overnight and it turns out fine!

This is very similar to the recipe my Mom would make for Thanksgiving and Christmas morning.  We'd whip it up the night before and then have a special breakfast.  It's fast and easy.   You can customize it however you like.  We mostly did ham and cheese, but we've tried sausage, bacon and various veggies.  Great dish.

So easy and yummy!! For the bread I used Texas Toast, which I think was perfect! I was a little hesitant to use bread instead of potatoes, but my whole family loved it for our Thanksgiving breakfast!! I used maple flavored sausage and to that added dried cherry cranberries. I love the simplicity of this recipe, but also love how you can make it your own.  I'm making it again tonight for our Christmas breakfast and I'm not changing a thing!

I've been using this recipe for years and it is a big hit on Christmas morning.  I NEVER use the amount of salt suggested here--the sausage and cheese have plenty so just a bit of sea salt is all that is needed.  I add sauteed (or softened in microwave) chopped red and green peppers for color, along with some chopped green onions and mushrooms.  I've had better luck letting it sit out for at least one hour to get the chill out before baking in the morning.  You can also increase or decrease this recipe by adding the same number of eggs to slices of bread (I use 8 of each for a 9x11 pan, 10 of each for 9x13 pan) to feed a larger group.  Remember to cover it while baking and then take the foil off for the last 10-15 mins.  It is also important to let it sit for 10 mins or so before serving.  Sometimes I serve it with warmed up salsa on the side (I doctor a jar of good salsa with extra fresh chopped tomatoes and cilantro etc.)  Gets rave reviews every time!

I have made this 3 times. I use small sausage links,,,& a 13" by 9" pan. I cook the links & line them up in the pan first, covering the bottom of the pan  (you can use pre-cooked links). Put bread on top of sausage.  I also up the eggs to 9,& add about 1/3 cup Half & Half. I substitute Swiss Cheese for the Chedder. mix the rest of ingrediants,& pour on top of bread. Cover with more Swiss cheese. Put aluminum foil on pan to seal. Refrigerate overnight, & cook in the morning.

This is a great basic recipe, and I love to make a few of these for brunch for friends and family.  I always get lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  I will make just a veggie one, or one with bacon, asparagus, and swiss.  Try any combination of different cheeses, veggies, and meats. 
Let your imagination run wild with this one!

My husband loved this!  I added some sautéed onions and broccoli, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp, and also added 1/2 tsp of pepper.  I bet this recipe could be made with hundreds of different variations - it will be fun to experiment!

A huge hit anytime I've made it. Added chopped red pepper and baby kale/spinach mix a few minutes before the sausage was done cooking, then followed the rest of the recipe as is. Amazing.

Excellent, easy, and Enjoyed!  A few mods just so I could use what I had on hand, bread was a herb foccia loaf that I cubed, meat was ground italian sausage and a bit of farmer sausage, added a small sprinkle of a gourmet italian seasoning, ground coarse salt and pepper, and used dijon mustard.  baked for 40 min covered, 20 min uncovered, let sit 5 min before serving.
It was well enjoyed and will make again, my adult son wants recipe!

Served it for Christmas brunch -- turned out great. Only change I made was to use frozen tater tots instead of bread and sauteed mushrooms with the sausage. Kids said they want this for next Christmas, too!

I have made this recipe for years, sometimes using sausage but more often using coarsely diced ham - saves time and dishes! My only addition to this recipe- if I remember- is to evenly spread one can of chopped green chili's (drained) on top of casserole just before baking. Superb, tasty recipe which is so easy to make!

I got this recipe from a coworker 30 years ago and it is still a family favorite. I prefer using ham and the original recipe includes a small can of mushrooms and a can of water chestnuts. It adds flavor and texture. Yumm!

Made this for Easter Brunch and it was a smash hit.  Made exactly as written with the exception of adding sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Will definately make this again and again and play around with ingredients.

I have been making this actual recipe for a couple of years now.  It's perfect for a brunch gathering and I love anything you can put together the night before.  We had it today for Easter morning and again it was a hit...actually the entire thing is GONE.  I have made it with both turkey and regular pork sausage and I prefer the turkey.  My stepson and husband prefer the pork.  The pork sausage is a tad on the salty side for me but that has to do with sausage quality, not the recipe.  You can doctor this recipe a million different ways.  Next time I may add some Rotele tomatoes for a Mexican flavored twist!

I have now used this recipes a few different times with some variations.  Last time I kept it overnight in the refrigerator instead of baking it when prepared.  Better if cooked when prepared, as the bread was too soggy left overnight.  Husband liked best when ham was used instead of sausage.  Last time, sausage was made by a local butcher, not a brand name, and the spices did not go well with the recipe.  I do like this recipe.  It is easily adaptable to individual tastes.  We omit the salt as there is already enough in the eggs, ham or sausage, and cheese.

Made it last night with mushroom/spinach/bacon bits and homemade sausage.  Used 4 day old homemade sourdough bread and this was a hit.  Didn't even measure just went with the flow.  My husband loved it! My daughters friend loved it!  And guess what I didn't even let it sit in the refrigerator just mixed it all up then baked accordingly.  Next time, however, i will let it sit overnight in the fridge just to follow tradition.  Will be taking to church breakfast in the near future.  Can't wait to experiment with other combinations.

Loved this recipe, I've made it twice now, exactly as the recipe calls and it turned out great!  Also, I noticed that some people thought this recipe called for italian sausage - it doesn't.  Just your favorite breakfast sausage.

Most good recipes act as a base that you can tweak in a myriad of ways and still get great results. This one definitely falls into that category. There are a ton of ways to tweak this, and they're almost always good. You can swap out the meat, cheese, seasonings or even the bread (if I don't have time to prep ahead of time, I use a bit of browned hashbrowns in its place). Seasoned taco meat, onions and olives are a good spicy alternative to mustard and sausage.

I made it just like the recipe stated, except I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp., since so many reviews said it was too salty. I also added some coarse ground pepper.  My husband and I loved it and I will start experimenting with some different variations now.  Also, it didn't take as long to cook as in the recipe....probably about 40 min. for me.

I would prefer this with less liquid, so I would reduce the milk a bit and I'd probably bake it immediately, like I would a dressing recipe. Thanks for sharing, it was well-received!

Made the recipe as written. It was good, but the bread layer was a little bland. Next time I will mix the bread, egg mixture, some cheese and sausage together and then top it off with a little more cheese. I know. That isn't a strata.

It was a good dish, but I think you should use less milk in it and cook it a bit longer.

I have been making this strada for years and years, we love it. the only thing I can not understand is HOW people can say that they "take it to the office, or to a pot luck,"  My strata raises up nice and fluffy like a souffle. but, when it starts to get cold it falls. and when heated the next day, it tastes good, but does NOT raise up again.

This was good, but the baking time was way off for me. I checked it after only 45 minutes and it was a bit overdone. It was set and the cheese had actually hardened after melting. It was still good, though without the cheesy goo that I was expecting so I took 1 star off because of the timing.

Very yummy!  I cut the salt in half, you can always add more to your own serving.  My pan was too deep (it wasn't a 7 x 11) and it took a long, long time to cook through. I look forward to trying again with the right pan.

Add leftover leeks from the last strata and also mushrooms.  Tom wasn't too keen on the sausage...said it's too heavy.

This was outstanding!  I will definitely make this again.  My boyfriend said he would prefer that the cheese wasn't as well done, but I love it that way.   Not well liked by our 12 year old.  He ate all the sausage & cheese, but left most of the eggs.  Then again he is a very picky eater.

This recipe was definitely easy and tasty.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it's not the type of food I want to eat a lot - lots of fat.  I liked another reviewer's suggestion to replace the sausage with lean ham and may try that next time.  This strata cooked for me in 40 minutes instead of the 50-60 specified in the recipe.

This is a good base recipe.  I chopped an onion and large clove of garlic and browned them with sausage, adding some rosemary and hot peppers as well.  Rye bread also added flavor.  Reduce or eliminate salt.  You could also eliminate the sausage and substitute more veges, such as broccoli.  Worked well in my 8x11 pan.

This was very good. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is that I would prefer some veggies in the recipe to help in the healthiness factor- I added a package of spinach. I recieved lots of compliments and will probably use this as a base recipe.

I wasn't too sure about the bread part though it seemed to get better the more I ate or maybe it was the more it cooled.  I added some onion while frying up the sausage and some pepper to the egg mixture.  I served it with the Fluffy Biscuits from this site.  Great to make when you are expecting company since all the prep work is done the night before so the only thing to clean in the morning are the plates.

it tasted like the bread cubes just absorbed all the grease from the sausage, making the whole thing really greasy.

I have made this twice.  The first time it was awesome.  The second time it was good.  I'm sure that it was something I did the second time.  Each time I added roased red peppers and the second time I also added crab.  This is a very good recipe.

Simple, tasty strata. I added a half bunch of chopped small asparagus, and used the Jimmy Dean Sage flavored sausage. Also used sour dough bread for the cubes. Will definitely make again

Easily doubled recipe! I loved that you can clean out your freezer with this recipe as well as make it ahead of time. I made it to take to an early morning potluck breakfast. Everyone loved it! It was really tasty. For a change of pace, the next time, i'll throw in some diced green chiles. Thank you for this recipe!
