this is SO good and SO easy! notes: i cooked the grits in 2 c. chicken broth and 1 c. half & half, instead of water.  i sauteed some leeks (white part only) with garlic, then added the shrimp. right before the shrimp were done, i added about 1/4 c. chicken broth and the diced / seeded tomato; this gives the shrimp a "sauce".  when serving, i garnished the grits with crumbled bacon, and the shrimp with thinly sliced green onion tops. have available tabasco-type sauce for those who like more spice.  excellent recipe!

Pretty good. We couldn't find the garlic cheese spread at Kroger's store so we improvised and used a mixture of cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and garlic to taste. It turned out OKAY.

I love grits, shrimp and tomatoes so I thought I would like this but it was even better than I expected.  I added a clove of garlic to the shrimp saute.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was fantastic!  I read the reviews and as suggested I substituted the water in the grits for 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup half and half.  Also, I added leeks to the pan before adding the shrimp.I have always loved shrimp and grits, but never had a recipe this good.....until now!  I will make this many times.

This is a great recipe!  I left off the tomatoes, since I'm not fond of them.  It's so easy, great for a Saturday night supper, after working in the garden all day.  Thanks a lot!

Awesome recipe and super easy to cook for an after work dinner meal. Plus the garlic cheese spread in the grits created an amazing flavor. The only thing I would have done differently (and I did) was add Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp. Cause how are they low-country without this seafood staple.

This was great! I've been meaning to make this forever, because I've always enjoyed shrimp and grits in restaurants when I order it. This tasted different than the way I was used to, but still very good. I did as a previous reviewer suggested and made my grits with chicken broth and milk, and put a little chicken broth in with the oil and butter to sautee the shrimp also. I threw in some asparagus with the shrimp and tomoatoes that I had sitting around, and fresh crushed garlic in both the shrimp and grit pans, and I used Velveeta as the cheese for the grits. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  I also used 2 cups chicken broth, one cup half and half in the grits.  I used a lot of salt and after it was cooked, I put in sharp white cheddar and a little bit of left over brie.  Also three cloves of fresh minced garlic. For the shrimp part, I sauteed bacon first.  Then in a clean pan, I put in some olive oil and butter, added the shrimp and some green onions, sauteed, and added yellow heirloom tomatoes and a little bit of some crumbled bacon.  When I put them together, I added additional green tops from the scallions and more crumbled bacon.  This was really really good.

Sorry, my family and I just didn't care for this recipe.  It tasted o.k. but we didn't like the texture of the grits.  Very gummy.  Perhaps they sat around too long while the other ingredients were cooking.  My husband didn't seem to mind - he ate a huge plateful.  I doubt I will make this dish again.

Your grits are too crunchy! Grits cooking ratio is 4 to 1. Four cups liquid to one cup grits, and you have to boil them alot longer than five min,,at least 15 to 20 min. But the cheese and garlic is a great idea.

I subbed low sodium chicken broth for the water when making the grits, and light garlic and herb cheese.   Other reviewers had mentioned sautéing a leek with the shrimp and since I had one lonely leek in the fridge I decided to follow their lead.  After sautéing the shrimp I added chicken broth and seeded, quartered cherry tomatoes to make a bit of a sauce.  Tasty and quick, I will definitely make this shrimp dish again.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. The shrimp was okay, but the grits had too much garlic. I'm from the South, so I love shrimp and grits. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

Um, delicious! Love this dish! I used Laughing Cow garlic and herb cheese. Boursin was just too expensive for an experiment. Shrimp cooked in butter and oil was fabulous!

Loved this recipe, only change I made was to use a different cheese flavor because I don't like garlic.

Yum! I used chive and onion cream cheese and a little garlic powder instead of the garlic cheese spread. Everything else stayed the same.

This was so easy and delish!  We really do not eat that processed cheese stuff so I used 1 c. shredded cheese instead.  I also cooked the grits in 2 c. chicken broth, 1 c. half & half per previous reviews but added 3/4 head of crushed garlic (we LOVE garlic).  It was so good even the children ate it right up.

I took other contributors' suggestions of cooking the grits with chicken stock and milk, adding a large pinch of cayenne to the cooked grits and garnishing with cooked, diced bacon (I used Oscar Meyer's turkey bacon to cut out some fat and it was delicious).  My own addition to the recipe was sauteeing diced onions in the bacon grease, then adding the oil and butter to the cooked onions and sauteeing the shrimp in this mixture.  Very rich and delicious!

I must admit I was skeptical at first.  I would have never thought to eat shrimp AND grits.  However, I found this meal to be not only satisfying and delicious, but innovative.  I have never tasted anything like it and I love shrimp.  Thank you Allison!

4 stars rather than 5 because of the garlic cheese roll. In 30 years of shopping I've never found it outside the southeast. AND I don't like processed cheese. Real cheese of your choice can be substituted.

I wanted a recipe to make immediately, so I used ingredients on hand: 
- Precooked shrimp worked fine. I roughly chopped them (better for the bites with  grits) and sauted with olive oil and plenty of garlic. I added drained diced tomatoes. (Good fresh tomato would undoubtedly be better, but the canned was fine.) I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, which I think was a great addition.
- Grits: I'd never heard of  using milk for part of the liquid. I tried it; it didn't seem to add anything and the milk scorched quickly.) I added the drained tomato liquid and it gave it a pretty color. I stirred in 3/4 of the grated cheese I had on hand (Emmentaler, which I thought I'd love or hate -- loved it).

I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have any garlic cheese spread, so I sautéed chopped, fresh garlic with the shrimp and I added grated extra sharp cheddar cheese to the grits.  I also omitted the tomato.  The grits were really creamy and the shrimp was delicious.  I plan to try this recipe again with a little spice added to the shrimp, maybe something cajun!  :-)

I made this for supper last night. It was very easy to prepare. My husband loved it. I have to admit, I did not like the garlic taste but he did. He said this was a keeper.

Super recipe for a quick, simple, very tasty dinner.  I added 2 T of fresh lemon juice.  We had leftovers and very carefully reheated the shrimp portion to have a second meal.

This was very good. My family loved it. I chopped a small amount of fresh garlic and used shredded cheddar cheese.
I'll make this again!

Loved this! Couldn't find the garlic cheese spread, so I used the garlic butter spread and just added about 1/3 cup of parmasean cheese to the grits.  I did saute shallots and chopped garlic in the pan before adding the shrimp. It was very yummy!

I like this recipe for its simplicity, but it definitely didn't knock my socks off.  I thought the grits lacked flavor, but it may have been the cheese that I used.  I used garlic and herb pub cheese spread.  I added some cheddar and sallt.  I had planned to cook the grits in chicken broth, but I forgot to buy the broth.  The shrimp is really simple, though I did add some minced garlic.  The shrimp and grits are a nice combination, though I couldn't eat these grits on their own.  This was th efirst time that I made shrimp and grits at home, and I was pretty satisfied with the results.  If I were to make this recipe again, I'd try a different type of cheese.  I"ll probably try out a few more recipes, though.

This was AWESOME!  My hubby wouldn't stop talking about it for days.  He brought the leftovers to work, where he became quite popular after offering samples to his colleagues.    Like others suggested, I also boiled the grits in a combo of broth and milk.  I also tossed in with the shrimp a (drained) can of Rotel to give it a bit of a spicy kick.  Since I couldn't find the garlic cheese, I added 1 cup of shredded pepper jack and 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar to the grits.  Turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!  Even my mother-in-law (who's quite the gourmet) wants the recipe after hearing my hubby go on and on about it.  :-)

Really good and really fast!  I did not have any fresh tomato so I omitted it.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup 2% milk to cook the grits. I chopped up some onion and garlic and sauted in the oil before I added the shrimp and then used some cajun seasoning and smoky paprika on the shrimp.  Used the cheese I had on-hand - some sharp american cheese slices and some medium cheddar which I grated up. The grits were creamy and rich with the cheese - a stick-to-your-ribs dinner!

I have to say that even though this wasn't the best shrimp and grits that I've ever had, it was pretty good. I took the advice of other reviewers by using chk. broth and half and half. I also used minced garlic and velveeta since I don't think they make the garlic cheese roll anymore. Next time, will cut back on the tomatoes (I used a can of petite diced) and use fresh, not frozen shrimp. Husband said it was a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great and quick, I made a quick, easy lunch that tasted great.  The only thing I couldn't find was the garlic cheese, instead I added some garlic salt and cheddar cheese to plain grits.  It was delicious!

I cooked the recipe as written except I couldn't find 7oz. pkgs. of garlic cheese so I used a 5oz pkg. instead.  My husband really liked it and it was super easy and fast to make.  Next time, I'll try using the chicken broth and milk instead of water for the grits.

I added low sodium chicken broth instead of the water. Then I combined Gouda cheese and Parmesan cheese.

Was really good. I  wasn't expecting the cream cheese though. Hubby didn't like the taste too much... Added some Old Bay to the shrimp just to give it some Louisiana flavor. Will definitely make again!

Very good and simple to make. I also prefer to make "dinner grits" with chicken broth and cream. I agree with having hot sauce at the table.
Thank you for this recipe.

I actually made the shrimp with a cauliflower mash instead of grits. We used some shaved cheddar, olive oil and salt/pepper to season the cauliflower. The shrimp were a great topping and we felt healthy! We will have this again!!!

Cooked this for my wife (Thelma) and she called it a winner.  I used a ham broth left from the cooking the shank bone and the half & half ( as suggested above).  Also, I used chopped tomatoes & chillies and just dumped the can in after adding the garlic cheese.  As the grits cooked, I did the shrimp. . .adding about 3 tbsp of cooking sherry to grits and the cooking shrimp.  When shrimp were pink, I just dumped them into the grits and cheese and stirred it all together.  Did make a tasso gravy with ham, sherry, corn starch, little ham broth and little half & half.  Spooned it over the top of the shrimp & grits I served in a bowl and garnished with green onion.  Raves all around the table.

Yummy!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and cooked the grits in 2C chicken broth and 1C half and half.  I only added about 3 oz. of Boursin cheese to cut back on the fat, but the grits were still creamy and delicious.  I sauteed the shrimp with olive oil and a splash of dry white wine.  I left out the tomatoes, but added onion and garlic to the shrimp.  My husband, who had never had grits before, really enjoyed this meal.  Served it with a garden salad.

This was an interesting meal I would have never thought tasted good together (shrimp AND grits).  I tried it out with grits I had made previously for breakfast.  Instead of putting garlic spread, I used garlic powder and slowly added cheddar cheese until it melted.  Next time I will try adding crushed cloves of garlic and letting the flavor mix into the meal for a bit like you do when you're making alfredo.  All in all, the family thought it turned out pretty well.

This was so good! I used the suggestion of chicken broth and half and half for the grits and it was soooo creamy!!  I used regular velvetta and added some chopped garlic. I had a friend over for dinner and she does not even really like grits and loved them. Her fiance is from the north and had never had cheese grits and he said he really liked them too.  I liked it b/c it was very easy to make and so good!
