This was the best smoked turkey I have ever made. The brine made it super juicy, tender, and full of flavor. I scaled down the recipe because I was just doing a whole turkey breast and it still came out perfect. I injected some seasoned salt but that is the only change I made. Perfect and 5 stars all the way!
