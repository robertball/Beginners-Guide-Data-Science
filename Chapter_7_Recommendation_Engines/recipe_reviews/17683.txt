I have to give this bread a four star rating as written, but by incorporating some different reviewers suggestions, this bread is definitiely a 5+!!  First of all, I used 1 1/2 cups of chunky applesauce and only 1/4 cup of oil.  I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I doubled all the spices- this was definitely a must for me.  I didn't think the bread was even that spicy like that, especially for a recipe called SPICED Applesauce Bread.  I added a crumb topping of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as well.  This turned this bread into a real treat!  I loved how moist the bread was, and it made my house smell amazing while it baked.  I'm definitely not a baker (cooking is much more my cup of tea), so if I can make an amazing applesauce bread with this recipe, anybody can!

Good, very moist, but as others mentioned, the original recipe lacks sweetness and spice.  This is a great base recipe and making it better is quite simple.  It does need more sweetness, so the 2nd time, I increased the sugar by a 1/4 cup.  Use all brown sugar for more flavor.  And doubling the cinnamon and nutmeg is a must.  I also sprinkle the top with brown sugar b4 baking, which makes a nice, crunchy sweet crust on top.  Cooking time is definitely longer than 1 hour considering how much moisture is in this.  I baked mine for 1 hour, 15 min.  Was perfectly moist.  And add 1 cup chopped apples.  The apples will cook down and be tender and adds more flavor to this.  1 cup = 1 medium sized apple. Kids love this bread and with slight alterations, it's 5 stars.  Tip -cover tightly with foil to let it steam for 30 min. or more.  This locks in the moisture and a trick for all loaf breads.

I'm going to give this recipe five stars even with my changes. Seems only fair.

I've been doing my best to use what I had on hand so making this bread was a challenge. I used half brown/half white sugar (I only had a half cup of white on hand) and added in another 1/4 c. of applesauce as I only had one egg. (I used homemade slow cooker applesauce that I made yesterday, a recipe also from this site.) Since I had little white flour on hand, I did a cup of white, then ground a half cup of oats in my blender and added that to a half cup of whole wheat flour to make a full cup.
I also used a stick of margerine in place of the vegetable oil to make the batter fluffier.

Before I put the loaves in the oven, I 
sprinkled some brown sugar over the top.

They turned out beautifully. Not exactly according to the recipe, but workable with what I have on hand. Plus, they smell divine!

For those of you who are thinking of making this, use a homemade chunky applesauce. You'll appreciate the flavor and texture better with homemade over storebought.

BTW, this made two loaves that were a bit on the thinner side, to decrease cooking time.

EDITED TO ADD: This bread turned out SO good. Try it with my changes. You'll thank me. We've already eaten one of the loaves.

Great bread!  I used unsweetened applesauce, and only 1/2 c. of sugar and it was still sweet enough to please my kids!  I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose, increasing the spices by a bit.  I baked it for the directed time (at 325 since I was using a glass pan) and it came out very moist and tasty!  Thanks! **I make this recipe almost every week now for my kids to snack on and I think I've perfected it to suit their taste -- I add 3/4 c. chopped apples, 3/4 c. chopped pecans and I'm down to 1/3 c. of BROWN sugar.  Super duper yummy**

Wow! This is one fabulous applesauce bread! It's so moist and delicious, it's definitely one I'd make again. Plus it's a great way to use up the last of the applesauce. It's also a great base to "tweak" this to whatever you have on hand or whatever your tastebuds desire.  I opted to use butter vs. veg. oil and creamed that will all brown sugar until nice and fluffy. I used chunky applesauce and added an additional chopped apple.  The more apple flavor the better, right?  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1 heaping tsp. of vanilla.  I left out the nuts as I didn't have any on hand.  I topped this with some turbinado sugar before topping it into the oven to give it some added crunch and baked for a little over an hour.  It smelled heavenly and tasted wonderful - perfect with a cup of tea!

A sweet, homey treat. I am not usually happy with loaves made with oil, so I substituted 1/2 cup of shortening and creamed it with the sugar before adding the wet and then dry ingredients. It is also good when you add 3/4 cup of raisins (soak in hot water for 15 minutes and then drain well). And I always add a struesel crumb mixture made from 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup soft butter.  Cut all ingredients together until crumbly.  Top loaves with about 1/4 inch of topping and press lightly.

With other reviews I knew to expect that this recipe be bland.  When I used the milk I also added 1tbs of apple vinegar to it, it increases the sweetness and spiciness of the bread.  I also doubled the spices as recommended and added a crunchy oat and brown sugar topping to the bread.
  Also, I greased the pan and dusted it with a cinnamon sugar mix. 
  It made the bread magnifique. My finace' who normally hates applesauce bread, and begrudingly tried this 'new' recipe, ate the enitre loaf before it had cooled completely.   Needless to say, I'm saving it with my alterations. ;-P

I found the perfect recipe to use up some extra applesauce I had in the frig!  I made muffins out of this recipe to take into work for a Monday morning treat.  I used half white sugar/half light brown sugar, and only a 1/4 cup of oil.  You can also use Apple Pie spice, which combines all the spices in this recipe into one.

GREAT recipe. I am a 15-year-old and at a beginner/intermediate level in baking, but this recipe was incredibly easy. I did modify the recipe a bit, though. First of all, I had no pecans, but I did add walnuts (about 3/4 cup) and chopped apples (same amount). Second, I used 1 cup whole wheat flower and one cup all-purpose, and instead of using 2 eggs I used 3 egg whites. I only used about 1/8 cup of vegetable oil and substituted the rest with applesauce. I ended up using 1/2 cup BROWN sugar, and I used fat-free soymilk instead of regular. Lastly, I added a pinch of extra salt.I baked the cake at 350 for about 33 minutes. The cake came out looking very nice, having a nice texture and tasting great (you could definitely taste the spices, and I'm very glad I added chopped apples and nuts)

Good flavor, though a tiny bit bland- maybe needed more sugar.  I added a cup of chopped fresh apples, which added texture.  The directions mentioned pecans, but they weren't listed in the ingredients, so I added 1/2 cup.  My kids liked it!

I made this today and its almost gone already! I used chunky applesauce and 1/2 cup of baking splenda in place of the sugar. It smelled fab while it was cooking and I can only imagine how great it would smell if I had baked it in the winter and all the windows were closed! It was a big hit and I will definately make it again! I don't use nuts very often in baking so the absence of them in the ingredient list didn't matter!

This is really delicious.  Kudos to all the reviewers who had such wonderful suggestions too - we added: 1/2 tsp ground cloves; doubled the nutmeg and cinnamon; halved the oil; used 3/4 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugars; an extra 1/4 cup applesauce; a peeled and minced gala apple; a tsp vanilla; sprinkled the pan with sugar and cinnamon mixture after spraying with pam; used 1 cup white and 1 cup white wheat flour; and, sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon over the top of the loaves before cooking.  This made 3 mini loaf pans which were filled 3/4 full and rose perfectly while cooking to come slightly over the top of the pan.  Not sure how long the cooking was - maybe 40 minutes before the toothpick test came out right.  Wonderful for sharing with friends and family.  Thanks for submitting this healthy (except for the sugars) and delicious (because of the sugars?) recipe for us to try!

Agree - would rate this 5 stars except the spices need to be increased substantially. I used 1 tsp. of all the spices, and it's perfect in my opinion - nice spice flavour. 
I also did what another reviewer suggested (I usually do this anyway) - decrease the oil to 1/4 cup and increase the applesauce to 1/2 cup to compensate. It's perfectly moist this way and much less fat.

Definitely need to double the spices, but other than that, this bread is a keeper! Mine got a little dark around the corner edges as it needed to bake for another 10-15 minutes before it was done, but I can live with that. Very moist & flavorful! I didn't have pecans so I used almonds instead and it was pretty tasty, but I'll make sure I have pecans next time. They will definitely round this out nicely. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!  :)

Really good.  I didn't use pecans but could have, a crunch would be tasty too.  I think the spices taste good, but could be upped if you really want a 'spiced' bread.  I made three loaves, and froze two.  Still tastes divine thawed from the freezer.

I made thie recipe EXACTLY as written:

Husband and I liked this bread. Howerver if you are looking for a kid friendly Applesauce bread, this is not the recipe. It is NOT sweet...........AT ALL. My kids ate one slice right out of the oven and that was it. The blueberry bread I made last week was a bigger hit. 

(5 members of the family I rate on how many people actually liked a dish.)

I loved this bread! It was sooo delicious. I changed one thing in the recipe and I thought it turned out wonderful. I love to juice Carrots and Apples in my juicer and I always have a ton of extra pulp. Soo.... instead of throwing it away I used the pulp in the bread instead of using applesauce. It worked out beautifully. You should give it a try if you juice and I am sure you'll love it.:D

This is soooo good, this is an excellent and adaptable recipe. I substituted about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice for the individual spices and left out the nuts. I'd like to try this with golden raisins which I think would be very nice too.   I split the batter into two 8" loaf pans and reduced the cooking time, I checked with a toothpick and the loaves were done at about 45 minutes.

I made a number of changes to this recipe. First, I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the 'regular' flour. I was delighted to find that this didn't give it a heavy 'healthy' taste. I did find it a bit drier than I expected. Based on earlier reviews, I decreased the oil to 1/3rd of a cup (I'll leave it alone next time!). I added a half cup of walnuts and a half cup of raisins-putting the raisins in a 1c measuring cup and heaping the walnuts over the top so once I put them in a zip-lock and pounded them into smaller pieces...it works out to a good half cup for the nuts. I mixed the nut/raisins into the flour mixture (i.e the dry ingredients) that way the raisins stay where they belong in the loaf (evenly distributed) rather than sinking to the bottom. The last change was that I used the 'chunky' applesauce in place of the regular. It left pieces of apple spread through the loaf. The last change I made was to decrease the sugar to 2/3rds of a cup--this worked out fine for me/us. It might have been the addition of the raisins, golden raisins at that, but it was plenty sweet. All and all, a very nice recipe. I'll certainly make it again.

This was a yummy, easy to make quick bread.  It will smell like heaven while baking--and it tastes great too.  Not too sweet, great moist texture.  For me, the recipe worked great as is.  The baking temp and time worked like a charm.  And I truly love these autumn spices (pumpkin bread is a favorite of mine) so I felt that the spice levels tasted great to me.

Only gave three stars because modifications are needed to the original recipe and you can't taste much of the apple.  Used 1/3 c. of butter instead of oil, 1 1/2 c. applesauce and doubled spices as suggested in other reviews, baked about 55 min..  It is good and moist bread.  I always line my pan with greased brown paper bags as my mother has always done with sweet breads.  I buy the packages of lunch bags and trim a little off around the edges.  Next time will try with some small pieces of apple to enhance the apple taste as suggested in some of the reviews.

Following other suggestions, this bread was fantastic!  I used 1 1/2 cups applesauce, 1/2 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup oil, then doubled all spices (including the salt, which it definitely needed).  Mine had to bake about 1 hour, 10 minutes.  Even at the end, a toothpick inserted in the middle still came out a little wet, but the edges were starting to *really* brown, so I pulled it out.  Was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I used apple butter and omitted the seasonings as the apple butter was quite strong in flavor.  They turned out pretty good.

This was a great bread to make. I read many reviews before making it and was a little disappointed that I didn't listen when everyone said to add more sugar. That said, as is the bread is really good with peanut butter spread on top! Next time I will definitely add more sugar and spice though.

This bread is just okay. Like many others, I doubled the spices and used 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. I think it would be far better with bits of apple in it, but I don't intend to make it again. It's still quite bland with doubled spices. Even with 20 minutes added to the cook time, it is still far too moist (read: wet). Not a keeper.

I took a reviewer's advice and added some chopped apple, and only used 1/3 cup brown sugar.  It was great, despite the fact that the bread didn't rise too much because I ran out of baking soda, oops!

Loved it. So easy. I used (by accident) a whole egg plus an egg white instead of two whole eggs-I was worried but the result was a wonderful light-as-air bread with yummy apple flavor. Try to use unsweetened no sugar added natural apple sauce if possible. Awesome!

I used less than half the white sugar but added a brown sugar and cinnamon mixture in the middle (divide the batter in two) and as a topping.  It was delicious and moist and beats grating apples!

I made this several times. I started adding chopped, dried cranberries and chocolate chips. I use 50/50 brown sugar and white sugar. I also use a brown sugar streusel topping. This recipe makes good muffins and even better mini muffins. Regular muffins took about 20-23 minutes, mini muffins about 15-18 minutes. The bread style I had to extend the cooking time by 10-15 minutes as the very center was still raw. My family swears it's one of the best things they've eaten. I didn't try using butter instead of oil as it tastes so good as is.

We have a B&B and this bread is in our regular rotation. It is very easy to make, as is the cleanup. The recipe as written is very bland especially when you're calling it applesauce spice bread. I triple the listed spices and add 1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. I also add 1/2 teaspoon apple extract. It gets raves every time.

Just ate my first slice and Wow, it is GOOD! I followed tips to double spices, 1 1/2 cups applesauce, and 1/2 white/1/2 brown sugar, and 1/4 cup oil.  Will definitely make again.  Also went with 1/2 whole wheat flour.
Wonder how it would be with 1/2 the sugar?

I read some reviews and I tweaked this recipe as well. I doubled the spices, used raisins instead of pecans, about 1 cup and instead of 2 cups white four used 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup wheat. THIS IS AWESOME, and everyone else that tried it was just sad there was not more. This will definitley be one of my new fav recipes.

Was nice and moist, but very bland.  i even doubled the cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice.  I didn't use nutmeg or allspice because I didn't have any on hand.  Maybe this is the problem, but I don't thinkI will use this recipe again.

This is fantastic! I had some homemade applesauce I wanted to use up and decided to try this recipe. I did make a few changes based on other reviews, I used only brown sugar, 1/4cup oil, 2 cups chopped apple and my own mixture of spices. 
I am sure that the recipe would have been wonderfull as written, but I prefer Brown sugar in this type of recipe to add a bit more dimention.
 Next time I will be making this with Splenda brown sugar blend to cut down the carbs.

Very moist!  Made without nuts and the milk. Sub the allspice with 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves!  5300 ft. so had to cooked for 1hr and 10 mins.  I covered with foil after 1 hr to stop burning on top.  Came out very moist and yummy!!! Thanks for sharing

Pretty good, but for something called "spiced" it's not really.  I even increased the spices somewhate, still didn't think it had much to it.  But still tasty, and makes very nice french toast.

My family enjoyed this bread.  I told them it was loaf cake and drizzled icing on top.  It was really good, very moist and baked well at the time and temperature stated.  I did add some extra cinnamon per other reveiws and subsituted cloves for  the allspice for personal preference.  Passed the picky child test!

I'm sure this is great as is but adding 1/16tsp cloves makes it so much better. Everyone loves it! Of course, I made it dairy & egg-free (vegan). Use Ener-G egg replacement or ground flaxseed mixed with water til a gel forms.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and was pleased with the results.  I did use 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, and I left out the nuts (personal preference).  I did have to cover my pan with foil for the last 10 minutes as the loaf was getting dark.  This recipe produced a moist loaf, slightly spicy bread.  Thanks.

Great recipe, although I do agree with the other reviews - you should add a chopped up apple to the batter for texture. I made a brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice mixture for on top of the bread and it gave it a nice spice crust. All in all, wonderful recipe as is and I will make it again.

This came out very well. I reduced the sugar, used part apple butter, added some spices, and used part white whole wheat flour. I forgot to put any nuts in the batter so I sprinkled them across the top along with a handful of brown sugar, and I think I like that better than putting nuts actually in the batter, because they got toasted :) This took exactly 60 minutes for me but I did use less flour in my batter because of the whole wheat. This loaf would make good muffins or a good sheet cake, with frosting. It's just the slightest bit likely to stick to your pan though so keep that in mind for muffins/loaves and plan accordingly (IE spray your wrappers, use real shortening on your tins and not just spray, or line your loaf pan with foil or parchment so you can lift it out later). I do think the flavor would be improved with chunks of apples, but the lovely slicing texture would suffer unless the apple were cut very, very small. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious bread.  I could eat it all myself in one sitting!  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used chia gel for the other 1/4 cup.  I used raw sugar and reduced it 3/4 cups and used whole grain flour.  I also added one diced apple and doubled the spiced.

This bread was pretty good.  I put in a lot more spice than it called for, and I kind-of think it needed some more.  This would be fantastic with some diced apple or grated apple.  The pecans in it are great!  I also took some brown sugar and sprinkled it on top to make a yummy crispy crust on top.  Fantastic.  Great with a little spread of Brummel & Brown Yogurt Butter.  If you haven't tried it, you really should!!!

Love this! So yummy. Very dense loaf with a super-rich, moist crumb. I can't wait to share it. I baked exactly 60 min in my 20 year-old Maytag gas oven.  I followed some of the advice of those who came before and doubled the spices, used 1/2c dark brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar, an extra 1/4c brown sugar and added 1 cup chopped apples.   One important change I made was subbing apple butter for the apple sauce, which I didn't have on-hand. My loaf was VERY flavorful, nice and spicy. I suspect the apple butter had a lot to do with that and the exceptionally moist texture. Enjoy!

I adjusted this recipe just as bit similar to everyone else's.  I used 1/4 c oil, 1 1/2 c of my own homemade applesauce (one sweet apple chopped, 1 granny smith apple chopped and cooked in water, brown sugar and cinnamon and then pureed in my mini processor) 1 c of flour, 1 c of pumpkin pancake mix from Trader Joes, 1/2 c sugar, 3/4 c of brown sugar, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Then I made a crumb topping of brown sugar, chopped walnuts, TJ pumpkin pancake mix, cinnamon and butter.  Baked at 350 for an hour.  So tasty and delicious!  Very spicy with the allspice and cardamom.  I didn't measure the spice, just added and tasted.

Great recipe.  I've been looking for something to use the pulp leftover from my juicer in and this one worked out great.  In place of the applesauce I used equal parts grapefruit, orange, and apple pulp.  In place of the milk I used heavy cream.  And I substituted ginger for the allspice and nutmeg.  The bread came out a gorgeous sunset orange with bright orange flecks in it and tasted sweetly citrusy with a light ginger scent.  The crust was crisp and pulled away from a very moist but not dense interior.

Only used about 1 tbsp of oil and made up for the rest in more applesauce.  Added more nutmeg and cinnamon, and a little less sugar. Came out great.  Try sprinkling coarse brown sugar on top before baking.  Good recipe!

This was great, especially warm from the oven. I used chunky (homestyle)applesauce, walnuts and a crumb topping (just butter, flour and sugar).  The bread looked like it came from a bakery.
Will make again and again.

I love this bread. I use walnuts instead of pecans and make a topping of 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tspn cinnamon. Combine and spread on top of batter in pan before baking. Youi have to cover bread with foil if topping gets too brown due to the long cooking time.

I loved the texture and the spices and the moistness of this bread but I agree with one other reviewer...it needed something. I looked at the recipe and 1/4 teas of salt might not be enough to perk up the flavor so next time I try it I'll use 3/4 teas. I also missed the pecans in the recipe so I used about 1 cup and it was great.

My family has enjoyed this bread recipe for several generations, but we add the following topping to make it 'over the top':  Combine 1/4 c. chopped pecans, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Spoon this mixture over the bread before you put it into the oven to bake.  This makes a crumbly, bakery-like topping, that adds real pizzazz to this recipe.  Hope you enjoy!

Very good and simple to make. I added half a cup of raisins, and baked the loaf 55 minutes in a dark metal pan. My family asked me to make this again before the first loaf was gone!

Definitely way toooo long a cook time! It was over done after 35 minutes! I cooked it below 350 too. It's not my oven either. Cook this at 350 for 30 minutes or 325 for 40. The smell was great and it tastes great. Recipe says to pous into pan which is misleading for the batter is so thick it does not pour. It;s more like bread pudding it's so thick so it must be scooped into the pan. I had to use a 12x12" pan as well. The recipe is a bit off in some areas, but if you make the necessary adjustments it's a good recipe.

My family loved this recipe!  I added 1 Tbl of apple cider vinegar and doubled the cinnamon and allspice but that is all I changed to the actual recipe I made.  I wanted to make sure we were going to taste those spices!  I also put it all in my bread machine to mix and bake.  When the cycle was complete, it wasn't quite done in the center so I put the whole bread pan in the oven for about 15 min and it was done perfectly.  It was very moist and had a wonderful flavor!  Thanks for sharing!

Following the recipe exactly as it's written (except for cooking it an additional 5 minutes), I give it 4 stars.  After 30 minutes, I inserted the toothpick & it seemed a little undercooked, so I gave it a bit more time.  This might be because I lined my pan with foil.  The cake wasn't as "spicy" as I imagined it would be, so I might double the spices next time like others have suggested.  It's a very nice cake though!  Kinda crumbly on the outside & nice and moist inside.  Reminds me of a hummingbird cake, sorta.

The bones of this recipe are great. 

In an attempt to make it a *little* less bad for me, I subbed the vegetable oil for walnut oil I had on hand, used a stevia/sugar mix instead of straight sugar (1/2 c instead of a full cup of plain sugar), and 1 cup of AP flour with another 3/4 cup of white whole wheat flour. I doubled all the spices as well and added lightly floured walnuts instead of pecans. I stayed away from adding extra sugar since this is a quick bread and not a spice cake, and I love how this turned out. In the past I've added raisins or currants and those also make this even more delicious.

All-in-all, the base recipe is probably my favorite for applesauce bread that I've found so far!

Great breakfast bread, moist and tasty. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested but I left out the allspice (did not have any).  I used coconut oil, 1/3 sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, and 1/3 Splenda.  I know, crazy.  The bread bake fine in 60 minutes.  This really turned out very nice. I will, made this breakfast bread again.

I added about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract to mine. I also used stone mini loaf pans so that I could give them as home-made gifts. I just eye-balled it and they were done in about 40 minutes instead of 60 for the larger loaves. If you use metal mini loaf pans, it probably will not take quite as long.

Fantastic bread!  I had some homemade chunky applesauce in the fridge, so I used it in this recipe.  Because there was quite a bit of liquid, I just omitted the milk.  This made 3 (6 x 3 1/2) beautiful and tasty small pans of bread.  I love having small loaves of quick breads in the freezer for my family and for sharing.  Thanks LOUISE for sharing your recipe.  We loved it!

Great.!! I made this recipe today and it is great.!!
I used "Spiced Slow Cooker Applesauce" from a recipe I got from this site.
As regards this recipe, I only made one change in the basic recipe, in that I used 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the combination of listed spices. I made it in two medium size loaf pans; then as soon as it came out of the oven, while still in the pan, I glazed it with my favorite glaze:
1 cup of powdered sugar, a little oil and orange juice to the consistency you want.(I usually make it about the consistency of cake batter) Be sure to put plenty around the sides and ends of the pan to soak in good and let the loaf cool completely in the pan.
Enjoy.!!!!

Exactly as I wanted - perfectly sweetened, moist, and smelled delicious. I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and it came out great.

I followed the recipe except for using some whole wheat flour in place of some white and walnuts instead of pecans.  The bottom of the bread stuck to the pan.  I didn't find the bread to be very flavorful.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This is absolutely wonderful. It smells great and is really moist. I can store it for at least a week and it's still great! I usually don't put in the pecans because I like the smooth texture without them. It's quite dense but I like that!

I can't give it more stars, b/c like so many, I altered the recipe.  I doubled all the spices, cut the oil in half and added that amount in apple sauce, added a pinch of ground cloves, and added a tablespoon or so of apple cider vinegar.  I think this would've come out as very moist, but I placed the pan on the top shelf, and noticed halfway through that the top was already brownish.  So I cut down the temperature (325F) and placed the pan on the lowest rack.  Total cook time was 1hr 20min.  The top had a little crunch to it, but it really added to the flavor.  However, the loaf came out drier...like a moist bread instead of a dense cake (what I thought the texture would be).  Still I had no problem with the flavor.  Very spiced, very nice.

My two cents- definitely double the spices and replace at least half the oil with applesauce. I was surprised this called for any oil, since I know of many recipes where oil is omitted and applesauce used in its place.  I think this would have been spectacular with pecans and apple chunks...It would have been a much different recipe, but I would have liked the texture differences.
Also, I took the oven down to 325 half way through.  Next time I would bake at 325 for 1 hr 20.

Moist, delicious bread.  I used 1 1/2 cups applesauce and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  I also doubled the cinnamon, but left the nutmeg and allspice as directed.  Baked these in mini loaf pans, and the topped with a cinnamon/vanilla glaze.  It was wonderful warm from the oven, but even better today.

Very delicious. Slices are great spread with peanut butter, as suggested in the description. I made as directed and thought it was perfectly sweet, and spiced enough for my tastes. Apples, more spices, toppings etc. probably are very delicious but this recipe as-written is really all you need. Thank you for sharing.

Fabulous bread!!  I made my own chunky applesauce (with green apples) the day before baking the bread and even left the apple peels on.  Used 1-1/2 C. applesauce in the recipe.  Went with 2/3 C. sugar and 1/3 C. oil.  Hoping to reduce these ingredients even more next time, but sure is good right now.  Chose to incorporate 4 T. sour cream rather than 3 T. milk.  Increased the cinnamon and nutmeg, but not the allspice.  Added raisins and walnuts.  Cooking time was almost perfect.  Only added an extra five minutes.  Everyone in my house is raving over this moist and delicious bread.  Try it yourself.

Very yummy with a few changes. I added 1 1/2 cups applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp each of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. I halved the sugar. I also added 1/2 cup each of unsweetened cranberries, chocolate chunks, and slivered almonds.

Terrific bread!  I wish I had read the reviews before, otherwise I would have doubled the spices.  Nonetheless, we really love this bread.  It is moist and flavorful.  I used cinnamon applesauce and added one chopped, peeled apple.  After baking for 60 minutes it didn't test done, so I covered it with foil and baked for another 10 minutes - this worked great.  This bread is even better one or two days after baking!

I have made this recipe a few times and it is good just as is, hence the 5 stars. That said, I think it is even better with a few modifications. I used half brown sugar and half white, added a tsp. of vanilla, doubled the cinnamon, and used unsweetened applesauce. If I'm in the mood for a healthier version with more fiber I'll omit a 1/2 c. of flour and replace it with 1/2 c. of old fashioned oats. I also think it looks nice to sprinkle 2 to 3 tbsp. of oats on top of the bread before baking.

Yummmy Apple Muffins!   I just took them out of the oven.  I almost always make muffins instead of loaves of bread. I made large muffins and baked them 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  They turned out great!   I did use some of the other reviewer's suggestions.  I added more (but not quite doubled) cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  I used all brown sugar and increased it to 1 1/4 cups... and I added one cup of diced raw apple.  Try this one....... it is delish!!!

I followed this recipe only making a few changes. I added more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice) and I added 1 cup of diced apple. This loaf is wonderful and moist. I have added this recipe to my collection and will definately be making it again.

I made this for an extra credit assignment in Home Ec, and I did not care for this recipe! It was much too dense, chewy, and dry. It also had very little flavor. I do not recommend it.

Great healthy recipe and so moist and yummy. I doubled the spices after I tasted the batter and could hardly taste any. I used half whole wheat flour and used 1 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 of the oil. To make it a bit more fancy I put a crumb topping in it- ground pecans,oats, cinnamon,  sugar, flour and butter.

I thought it was a 2 star, my boyfriend thought it was a 4 star, so I'm going to compromise and give it 3 stars.  It is nice and moist, and while it smelled great while it was baking, I thought it lacked flavor, and what flavor it did have was kind of strange.  Don't think I will be making this again.

Yummy!  This was great with some adjustments.  I TRIPLED the seasoning (except the salt) and think next time I might even quadruple it.  Couldn't imagine how bland this would have tasted if I followed the recipes amounts.  Also used half white flower and half wheat flower as someone else did to make it not so dense.  This was delicious and light.  I thought served with butter its fantastic!

MMM.  Wow!  Fantastic!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and instead of 1 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup splenda.  I also added 1/2 cup of glazed walnuts and replaced the individual spices with pumpkin pie spice.  I reduced the oil to about 1/4 cup with no effect on quality or taste.  This stuff is heavenly and pretty darned healthy.

I made some changes that helped too I think. I used chunky applesauce that left pieces of apple throughout. I used 1/2 TBSP of vanilla (I like it a lot), I added 1/2 cup pureed butternut squash ( I hide veggies in my kids food), I doubled the cinnamon, added 2 TBSP of flaxseed meal (again to hide from kids.) I baked for 70 minutes and was very tasty. Two toddlers ate 1/2 a loaf! Thank you!

I made several adjustments to the original recipe, and with those, I would rate this 5 stars.  I used a little less than 2/3c. white sugar, 1/3c. oil (instead of 1/2c.), 1c. whole wheat flour & 1c. all purpose, I doubled the cinnamon & nutmeg (I might even use more than that next time), didn't have any allspice so I subbed 1/4 tsp. ground gloves.  I also added 1/2c. diced dried apples & 1/2c. chopped walnuts.  I made muffins instead of a loaf, and they came out extremely moist and flavorful this way.  Thanks for the post Louise.  I'll be making these often!

I took the advice of others with the brown sugar replacing half the white sugar and doubling the spices. I also added chunks of real apple. I sprinkled the top with brown sugar. At the accurate temp and doubling the recipe while baking in two loave pans...it required about 70 minutes. 

My husband loved it and I thought it was really good. My kids did not like the nutmeg flavoring or the chunks of apple in it. I had made an applesauce bread about 2 months ago they loved, so they were very disappointed with this. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

A great dense moist bread! I doubled the recipe but was just shy on the applesauce so added 2 very ripe bananas. Also, per other reviews, I doubled the spices, used half each of brown and white sugars, scaled back on the oil and subbed 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour, and added chopped walnuts. I baked it in a greased bundt pan for an hour.  A great bread but next time I will add 1/4 cup more sugar.  Then it will be PERFECT!

This bread was ok, but a little on the bland side. If I made it again I would use more spices.

..Really like this recipe.  I made this over the weekend for company and just kept it in the fridge to snack on.  Perfect with strawberry butter OR cream cheese with chopped pecans...The only change I made was used br sugar, homemade applesauce and rounded all the spices...Thanks Louise!

Very good, great flavor.
I increased the applesauce to ~1 1/2 cups and decreased the oil to 1/4 c. Also doubled the cinnamon and added a dash of cloves. I put in a teaspoon of vanilla out of habbit before I realized the recipe didnt call for it...
Great recipe, will try it as dense muffins to bring in to work next.

Excellent bread!  Easy to make on a moments notice too since everything is always on hand in my kitchen.  I doubled each of the spices but other than that didn't change a thing.  It was moist and delicious and my entire family really loved it.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is so easy and yummy!  I use 1 cup of bread flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the 2 cups all-purpose flour.  Also, I add 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves.  This is a great treat for your family or to take as a gift or a treat to be shared at an event!

This was a BIG hit at my house.  The texture is almost custardy it is so moist, and the spices really blend well.  My picky sweetie asked what the name of the bread was after his second piece (a good sign) and after his third piece he said he wished he wasn't so full because he wanted to just keep on eating the bread!!  That's as good as it gets.

This was an excellent bread. Next time I am going to try some chunky applesauce and I may add a little bit more seasoning because I like a strong cinnamon taste but it was perfect as is too. I will make this again!

This was a good bread, but I found the nutmeg too strong, and I didn't put in allspice.  60 minutes at 350 left the outside burned and the inside just done, so I think I'll turn it down and cook it longer next time.

THIS ONE"S A KEEPER!

I am definitely a beginner when it comes to baking, but this was really easy! And it took very little time to prepare.

I didn't have allspice, so I used a dash each of ginger and cloves, and used 3 eggwhites instead of two whole eggs.  Also I used Motts chunky applesauce, so there are little apple chunks throughout.

Next time I'll play with extract flavors or maybe chocolate chips...

Perfect base recipe! As others did, I doubled the spices, halved the oil, used half white, half brown sugar plus another 1/4 cup brown sugar. I threw in half a jar of orange marmalade as well just for kicks (and wow did that add to the yum factor), used half whole wheat, half white flour, and basted the bread with brown sugar glaze after it cooled a bit. Cooked it for an hour in a gas oven. This is the best spice bread we've ever eaten. Perfect for gifting.

Its tastes fine. The 2 stars is for a mistake in the recipe. It says 60 minutes. It's a good thing my nose said to check the oven, because if I had left it for another half hour, the bread would have been a smoldering lump of coal. I check after about 25-30 minutes.  I know this because I used a timer.

Since I am a Celiac, I used Bob's Red Mill Baking Flour 1:1.  It already contain xanthum gum so I didn't add any more.  I used homemade applesauce that was a little chunky, doubled the spice due to other reviews, had to use some coconut oil because I didn't have enough vegetable oil, and I used walnuts because I didn't have pecans on hand.  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and it turned out excellent!  I always wonder about people reviewing a recipe then tweaking it so much, but truly, this recipe was versatile  enough I could use the substitutions because I didn't shop first.  This one is a keeper for sure!

Followed many suggestions and upped the spices, cut the oil, etc:
Used 1 1/4 C sugar free applesauce
Added 1 C chopped Fuji apple
Cut white sugar to 1/2 C
Added 1/2 C brown sugar
Cut oil to 1/4 C
1 t cinnamon
1/2 t nutmeg
no allspice, so subbed an extra 1/4 t cinnamon,
1/4 t cloves, and
a pinch of nutmeg.
No change to eggs, milk, flour, baking soda, baking powder or salt.

On the second batch, added a topping of 1/4 C brown sugar and 1 t cinnamon. Made a nice crust, but tastes fine without it.

Baked in four foil mini pans for 42.5 minutes.

Even with doubling the spices, I wouldn't call it spiced--more a nice apple bread.

Best cream cheese frosting ever! I baked my cake 10° lower than  suggested, but I always do this and bake a little longer if necessary. Glad I did it this way because at 340° for 30 minutes it was done. Cake was not as light as I had hoped.

I decided to give this 5 stars still despite all the changes I made because if there’s anyone else looking for a similar recipe like I was, the original recipe serves as a really good base.

I read all the reviews and doubled my spices. I also don’t like all spice so instead I used 1/4 ground cardamom & 1/4 ginger. I also used Pamela’s GF flour instead of regular flour. I used ghee and butter in place of the oil. I subbed maple syrup the white sugar. I *didn’t* use any milk. Lastly, I made my own applesauce following ‘Sarah’s Applesauce Recipe’, which can also be found on this site. It made exactly enough for this spiced bread cake.

Despite GF flour being so dry and despite not using any milk, this was still a very wet batter and took much longer to cook. But it smelled heavenly and tastes heavenly. It’s moist, has a really wonderful dense-yet-airy texture, and the flavor is fantastic. Really loving the cinnamon-nutmeg-cardamom-ginger combo.

Reduced the amount of sugar (just as a preference by 1/4 c.) ,used only 1/3 c. oil, and used walnuts. It turned out wonderfully but took only 50 minutes. Sifting the flour makes a difference for certain.

Great recipe. I changed a few things. Skipped the oil and added more applesauce. I also added cardamom, went heavy on the cinnamon  and I used less than half a cup of evaporated cane juice sugar. I wanted them to be flavorful  but not to be too sweet because I intend to eat them for breakfast with my homemade vegan butter. Very delicious! Very moist! I made 18 cupcakes and I baked them for about 25-30 min just keep an eye open for them. They were very moist and not dense. Very cakey! The batter was wet and thick and it caused my cupcake liners to get stuck so be careful! I had to stick the cupcakes upside down inside the microwave, on a plate and then I had to moistened a paper towel and placed it on top of them and microwave for 15 sec to be able to remove the liner.

Used homemade chunky spiced applesauce. It turned out excellent. For high altitude I added an extra egg and an extra handful of flour.

this is a very easy recipe, i substituted 1 tbsp of greek vanilla yogurt for 1 of the eggs, and I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I put pecan halves on top instead of putting crushed pecans in the batter.  It is very tasty and looks beautiful.

Yummmm!  Read through some other reviews and made tweaks that sounded good (along with limitations to ingredients on hand).  I altered to have:  1 c applesauce and half cup of minced apple,  sanded the greased pan with sugar, used almond milk vanilla creamer instead of milk, did half brown sugar and half sugar (and I'll increase sugar by another 1/4 cup next time), added a streusel topping, used walnuts instead of pecans, and went nuts with the spices)!  I suggest to at least double the cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg, and add similar amounts of clove, cardamom, orange peel, and pumpkin pie spice - and then just a dash of cayenne for some je ne sais quoi.  So freaking GOOD!  Baked up perfectly in exactly one hour for me: nice, dense and moist after a wooden kebab stick came out clean testing for doneness (which I use instead of toothpicks because they're longer).

This is a wonderful base recipe - loads of room for creativity to make it your own!

I made this twice .... the first time I followed the recipe as written substituting golden raisins for pecans...nut allergy.   I baked it a little longer than suggested.   My husband loved it.  The second time I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. & the nutmeg to 1 tsp., allspice the same.   Again, added 10 min. to bake time.....as with the first my husband loved it.   It’s moist, not over spiced (both times) and is really good slightly warmed.   I used fresh, homemade applesauce for both loaves.   It’s a keeper.

Delicious!  I substituted a stick of butter for oil. I threw in a few raisins and used black walnuts (yum!) instead of pecans. I doubled the cinnamon and allspice and added 1/2 tsp of cloves. I didn’t have any baking powder but the bread turned out just fine. Very moist!  It tastes so good!

Very nice, moist quick bread. Topped it with a glaze made with Pillsbury apple caramel frosting, and everyone who tasted it said the recipe is a real keeper.  This will undoubtedly become a staple.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I was very satisfied with this bread. I liked that it was not too sweet. I wanted it to be like a bread, not like a cake. Perfect for breakfast by itself, or with a spread of butter or cream cheese.

I followed the recipe exactly, which I do 99% of the time when trying a new recipe.  I think it might be better using chunky applesauce. The bread has nice texture, is moist and delicious, but it isn't one that I would go shopping for the ingredients.  It's great for using leftover applesauce, though we seldom have any leftover.

It was moist and not to sweet which is good but was really lacking spice. I will double the spice next time and try with chunky applesauce to give it some texture.

Excellent recipe with the additional quantities as mentioned in other reviews. Double the spices and add 1/4 cup of apple sauce. The brown sugar glaze topping is a just as well. Just add a glass of cold milk to drink and your set!

I liked this bread a lot.  I didn't think it was bland but yes could of used a bit more 'spice'.  No biggie.  And I love the ease of the recipe as this a true 'quick bread' in every sense of the word.  

My one disappointment however (if you can even call it that)--is that, if you love Traders Joe's (seasonal) Pumpkin Bread Mix as I SURELY do and I typically diplore 'mixes'--yeah well, don't pass out in the aisle------just go home and make this cause it taste almost like that if not just as good.  

That's the disappointment.  It didn't taste errrrrrrrrrrrr....'apple-lee-e'?    At all.  Next time though,  maybe I'll add some shredded apple to the batter.  Don't know if it will make a difference but I'm not sure if the "chunky applesauce" suggestion--- is going to make much of an....an 'apppllleeee--eee'  difference either.  

However.....

It's not so much of a disappointment that I won't make it again.  I will DEFINITELY-- make this again.  I made two loaves for my church leadership breakfast that me and my sister host every month.  One recipe as written & one with b. sugar,  amp'd up spice & I threw in some pecans for well---no good reason.  

I'm going to be honest.   First, the 'as written' --was better tasting to me.  The b. sugar (and what doesn't IT enhance) detracted away from it to me.  And I'm a sugar baby...and it was sweet enough for me to love.  Second, not overly moist but was a perfect texture to me .  Third, I absolutely LOVE a bread that 'crowns' beautifully.

made in 2, small tins or 4 mini tins - doubled to make bigger batch.  Changes as suggested by another user a MUST.   Used chunky applesauce, 1 1/2 cups, oil 1/4 cup, half white sugar, half light brown sugar, double the nutmeg and cinnamon. I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.

I made the following changes based on reading some of the reviews and what I had on hand. It came out moist and not too sweet. This is a good recipe for a basic bread. Adding raisins made a huge difference! I'll be making this again.

1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour
1.5 cup unsweetened apple sauce
1/4 cup canola oil (what I had on hand)
1 cup brown sugar (what I had on hand)
1.5 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (what I had on hand)
1.25 cup raisins

Only thing I added to this were some chopped up apples.  This a great recipe. Second time I made this good snacking bread.

It seemed like too much batter for one loaf.  I put it in two pans and baked them for 45 minutes.

After reading reviews, I decided to make the follow alterations:  Used 1/2c unbleached AP flour, and 1/2c whole wheat flour.  Used apple cider instead of milk, and decreased the oil to 1/4c .  I  increased the baking powder, cinnamon and allspice to 1 tsp., and increase the freshly ground nutmeg to 1/4 tsp.  I added 1 chopped granny smith apple and about 1/2c of chopped walnuts.  I baked mine in small loaf pans for gifts.  Wonderful!

Delicious. Would make again. We put in extra cinnamon, used cinnamon applesauce, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. We omitted the pecans and nutmeg. Still tasted great. We had to bake it a little longer than the recipe calls for.

It's delish!  I will make this again.  I did as the prior reviewer suggested, used 1.5 cups apple sauce (I just used regular as I didn't have chunky open), reduced oil to 1/4 cup, used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and doubled spices.  Really good and really moist!

Always a favorite of mine.  It is not really sweet and lets you enjoy the apples, not the sugar.

This recipe makes a good base, but needs improvement to take it from slightly lacking, to delicious. I took the advice of another reviewer, who advised adding a streusel topping and doubling the  spices, as the bread isn't very spicy as written. This definitely improved the recipe.

i give this four stars for being very good.  since i made a good few changes to it, i rated it 4 out of 5.  for the applesauce, i used the big name brand chunky applesauce which already has some cinnamon in it, the chunks of apples is really great in this.  for the vegetable oil, i substituted coconut oil.  it's just delicious using the fragrant coconut oil.  i swapped out 1 cup of King Arthur organic whole wheat flour. KA flour is very finely milled and boosts the nutritional value without sacrificing a tender outcome for the bread.  also, i used half brown sugar and half white.  also, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and skipped all the other spices except cinnamon and made that a very heaping tsp.  also, threw in a scant 1/2 tsp of salt. and always have used walnuts just because it's what i mostly have around, though i'm sure the pecans are great in this.   i've made this bread countless times now, using three mini bread tins rather than one large bread, baking for about 40 minutes or so at same oven temp. (easier to give them away as gifts and not keep so much of it around!)  this is a very good recipe with room for personal touches.

I doubled the spices, per others' suggestions, and even though the bread wasn't bad by any means, it still had a bland taste.  It needed more apple flavor, so I may try the chunky applesauce idea next time or add in some chopped up apples.

It's ok. (Moist and edible) Didn't love it.  I will say that I followed instructions (as I like to do before I make variations) but this spiced applesauce bread is not a "hit" for me. 

Not bad, but not great either. Can be tweaked, I think. Thanks for sharing.

I did post a photo.

Other than using more spices than called for, I followed this recipe closely.  It came out a bit bland. Thankfully, I pulled it out of the oven about 5 minutes early - it was already starting to burn around the edges.  The bread was moist, but I'm sadly still on my hunt for the perfect applesauce bread/cake.

Followed previous suggestions about adjusting amount of applesauce, oil and spices.  When I canned my own applesauce, I saved the excess apple juice.  I used some of that in place of the milk for more apple flavor.  Rehydrated dried apples (in microwave) can be added.  Be sure to use unsweetened applesauce or it can get too sweet.

Although I accidentally baked this a little too long, it still came out dense, moist, and delicious (after the harder ends were cut off!). I doubled the spices and agree with some others that I will probably even triple the spices next time... but it was still gobbled up at the women's meeting I took this to! I noticed though after I cut it that it looks very nondescript... it could use some chopped apple pieces to jazz it up.

Turned out perfect! Just like my mom made us when we were kids. I doubled the spices, as people mentioned in other reviews, and also added some brown sugar and raisins. I made mine in miniature loaf pans and only cooked then for about 40 minutes. I will definitely be making this a lot!

I followed the recommended changes, doubled spices, reduce oil a bit, etc. This bread was so good that my adult son who was visiting ate nearly the whole loaf.  I added some fresh golden raisins I had -- with the fresh raisins, no need to soak.  I'm trying this again with some dried currents (not fresh, so soaked) and more raisins.  Yum!

This was one of the most moist loaves I have ever made.  Only a few minor changes: 1 1/2 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup crisco veg oil; whole white wheat flour instead of AP flour, doubled the spices and added 1/2/ cup chopped apple and 2 tbsp walnuts.  Amazingly better flaver the next days after as well! A KEEPER!

This is one of my favorite uses of our canned applesauce.  Wonderful, lighter snack around the holidays.  Even my picky daughter (age 6) loves it.

Excellent! I used up some apple butter I canned last fall and omitted the nuts. Would make a great holiday treat as well as an anytime snack. Not too sweet (although you can always adjust to your taste with both sugar and spice quantity). I recommend this highly!  One note - I lowered the temp to 300 after 50 minutes as it was still raw in the center - my total bake time was 80 minutes, still turned out great!

This made a good breakfast. I used half wholewheat flour and left out the pecans. My girls and their boyfriends demolished this in one sitting. They particularly liked it with peanut butter as suggested by the submitter. Thanks for the recipe Louise.

This is a very nice bread, moist & flavourful.  I did double the spices but other than that didn't change a thing.  My husband couldn't wait for a slice so had some warm with whipped cream on the side - he tells me it's a keeper!

This was a very nice recipe and probably would have been better had I remembered that I was out of CINNAMON.  Aarrggh.  Extremely moist and a very generous loaf.

I really wanted to like this bread based on all the good reviews it recieved. I just did not like it at all. It didn't have much flavor and it had a weird almost rubbery texture because of all the applesauce. I don't think I'll be trying it again.

I am giving it 4 stars as written because I don't think it would have enough spice. I doubled all of the spices and added just a touch of nugmeg and it was a dense, moist and delicious bread. I think next time I would also add some chunks of apple.

This was ok. I added chopped apples, wheat bran and oatmeal to the batter. I also used yogurt instead of oil and agave nectar instead of sugar.  If i wouldn't have added the apples, it wouldn't have had any flavor. It definitely needs at least double the spice.

These are AMAZING!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  I doubled the spices and didn't have allspice so used ginger instead.  I used raisins instead of pecans and added one chopped and peeled apple.  I also made them into muffins and baked for 25 mins.

This is a very flavorful and moist bread. I had just made a big batch of homemade applesauce (very chunky) and so I tried this bread with my applesace. It was great! The chunks of apple were a nice treat in it.

I wasn't too impressed with the way this bread turned out, so next time I will use the suggestions of "MommyfromSeattle."  She used all brown sugar, doubled the spices (I already did that and still think it needs more) and throw in some diced apples.  I think that should do the trick.  Raisins and walnuts would be a nice touch as well.

Moist, dense and quick, but other than that I wasn't overwhelmed by this bread. I didn't use all of the sugar (and am glad I didn't) because 1 cup seemed like way too much . Fragrant while baking, but the flavour in the final product wasn't that spectacular. It needs more spice. As is, this just didn't appeal to my tastes.

Pretty good.  I'll make again to see if the dryness was my fault with overbaking.  I used 4 mini loaves instead of oen whole one.  They were baked in 40 min.  Probably could've taken them out at 35.

I give this recipe 4 stars as written.  I did follow some of the suggestions in other reviews.  I increased the apple sauce to 1 1/2 cups, doubled all the spices and added a tsp of ground cloves, also only used 1/4 cup of canola oil and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar.  It was spicy and delicious, my 17 month old could not get enough of it and my husband even liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so delicious! I made a few changes though: I peeled and chopped one medium apple and added it, I used half white sugar, half brown, half white flour, half wheat, doubled the spices, and before baking i sprinkled with brown sugar on top with dots of butter. It's wonderful! I think i may end up making another loaf today!

I made this for a group of people tonight and they all loved it.  A few changes: Add 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Double the spices.  Bake at only 325 degrees for a glass pan, and add 10 minuts to the baking time.

Good, but after reading the reviews I added more spices, including cloves.  I think I had a bit of a heavy hand with the cloves--still tasting it now!  I do think that if I hadn't added more spices it would've been a bit bland for me.  Thanks!

We loved this recipe. I doubled the recipe and used half as much oil as was called for, substituted half whole wheat flour and added raisins and walnuts. I took a bunch to work and everyone loved them! Will make again.

I only gave this 4 stars because I made a few changes, the results were fantastic!  First off, I made it into muffins instead of bread, I reduced the sugar to a little more than a 1/2 cup, used 1 cup whole wheat flour and I cup all purpose, I doubled the spices, used fat free sour cream in place of the fat, and added raisins and chopped walnuts!  I sprinkled the top of the muffins with cinnamon/sugar mixture!  The family raved over them for breakfast this morning!  They were so moist, light, and healthy not to mention a great use for the tons of homemade applesauce I made this fall!!!

This is a great basic recipe for a moist applesauce bread, but as others have said the spices must be doubled for it to live up to the "spiced" portion of it's name.  I doubled the spices, added walnuts and raisins the first time I made it.  Served it with a cream cheese icing.  It was a big hit.  The next time I made it I played with it a bit more and added dried cranberries, walnuts and the zest of one orange for a Christmas brunch.  It was delicious!

I followed the suggestions on doubling the amount of spices. I used cloves instead of allspice. I also added 1 cup each coarsely chopped apple and walnuts. Mine baked at 350° for 42 minutes then at 325 for another 10. Perfect!  I sliced it thin and put on some cream cheese.  Yummy!  Next time I am going to try adding chopped dates instead of the chopped apple.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

I made it as written except I used butter because I had already softened it for another recipe.  It was great, next time I will try the oil, I assume that would be healthier.  Also, it could have used a little more spice, so I will increase the spice next time.  But all in all, extremely easy and if you stock applesauce, it is something you could make with very little notice.

This is not good. Moist, dense, and all that, but truly not spiced, and not sweet. I even glazed it, added chopped apples, raisins, and more spice...and still blah. Won't be making this again.

I doubled all of the spices and I felt as if they still weren't prominent enough. Yes, the bread was moist but at the same time it was way too dense for my liking. I boiled the applesauce and added the raisins into it, then preceded to do everything else as directed. I wouldn't ever make this bread again.

I just changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. It's a year since I found this recipe, and I just make it all the time! Wow, it is so good. I was low on eggs today, so I just did a half of a batch and made them into muffins instead, and it was phenomenal! The only change I make to the recipe is that I just brown sugar instead of white sugar. Everything else is perfect! It's so moist and flavorful. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was good but I was looking for something a little different. I have enjoyed one at a restruant with cream cheese and chicken salad on top of applesauce bread. I will keep looking for the right bread.

Very good bread and so light and fluffy.  Only had sweetened applesauce on hand, so cut sugar to half-cup.  Lots of compliments.

My husband gave this a 3, but my son loved this, so I bumped it to a 4.  I made it as is.

This recipe didn't come out right for me.  I followed it exactly except for I added chopped up apple and walnuts.  The batter in the middle didn't cook and I had to throw everything away.

A lovely, moist bread, delicately spiced.  I used unsweetened applesauce (which is all I had on hand) and added about a quarter cup of brown sugar.  I followed everything else exactly, with about a half cup of chopped pecans.  Everyone loved this recipe.

This tasted very good.  I would have given it a higher rating, but there seemed to be an ingredient (pecans) missing from the ingredient list.

I added in a grated apple and reduced the amount of applesauce.  I also added a handful of dried cranberries.  Try a slice toasted!
