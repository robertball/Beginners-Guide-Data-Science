I was skeptical about this recipe, but the roast turned out great. I don't keep wine around the house, so I substituted Lawry's New York Marinade (awesome stuff) and some au jus for the red wine.  Other than that, I followed the cooking directions exactly and it was easy and tasted great.  The roast was tender without falling apart. The sauce was also very thick without having to thicken it with flour.

Used olive oil and my own seasonings. It was good but I think there are better recipes out there.

Followed the directions exactly and it burnt to a crisp... was completely unedible.  Smelled good while cooking though, I will probably try it again and double or triple the broth.

I added cornstarch instead of flour, and used olive oil instead of generic vegetable, and it came out great.  everybody loved it.
