If you want this to tase like real chile verde, then follow my additions. Be sure to remove the jalapeno addition if you have kids to feed as it will make it to spicy for them. I did not use green salsa, I used green enchilada sauce (La palma), added two shredded, dried New Mexico chiles, 3 cloves of garlic, a can of roasted green chiles, 1/2 TB salt, 1/2  TB cumin, then I added 2 TB  cornstarch during the last 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Be sure to dissolve the cornstarch in cold water, then add to the hot chile verde. If you follow these additions, you'll have authentic chile verde from a slow cooker!

I would highly suggest replacing the diced tomatoes with stewed tomatillos and adding the following ingredients: corriander, cumin, lime juice, black beans, corn, & cilantro.  If nothing else, the tomatillos keep the chile more green.

The flavor of the meat is outstanding, and it's incredibly tender. Chili Verde is meant to be more than seasoned meat, so expect a *liquidy* product - the sauce is flavorful and has great heat, perfect on rice. The one thing I altered was the slow cooker setting - I just went for 6 hours on low, and the meat was perfectly cooked and tender, I'll be making this again and again - thanks so much for sharing :)

I get so tired of reading snarky reviews on this site because a recipe isn't "AUTHENTIC."  I, too, prefer green chile from scratch where I roast the chiles myself.  But I don't always have time for that, and often need to put a quick, healthy dinner together that the whole family will eat.  So I'm grateful when other folks put recipes on here with some shortcuts that make my life easier.  

Now the review part... this is a delicious, easy recipe.  It's good over rice, on breakfast tacos, burritos, or with quesadillas.  I left out the jalepenos because I have young children.  The green salsa still gave the chile plenty of heat.  I added 1 tsp. of cumin, 1/4 tsp. of white pepper, and 2 TBSP. of lime juice (I use those in my from scratch recipe).  This recipe works well with chicken if you don't have pork on hand (and, yes, I know the chicken isn't "AUTHENTIC." chile verde).  Happy cooking!

I HAD TO RATE THIS AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN BETER THE NEXT MEAL WE HAD OUT OF IT. I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO MAKE 3 MEALS OUT OF IT. WE HAD CHIMICHANGAS WITH THE PORK, RICE, AND CHEESE FRIED WITH SOME SAUCE POURED ON TOP WITH QUESO FRESCO AND SOURCREAM SO AWESOME. THAN WE SAVED THE SAUCE SINCE WE USED ALL THE MEAT FOR THE CHIMIS AND THE SAUCE IS GREAT WITH EGGS IN A BURRITO WITH CHEESE.tHANKS

This was to die for!  My husband loved it, my kids loved it, and so did I!  I followed the recipe exactly, the meat was so tender, it melted in your mouth.  There was a lot of sauce left over, so you could cut down the salsa verde by one can and it wouldn't make a difference.

Everyone loved this. I used Herdez green chile salsa and diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Very easy to make.

This was excellent.  I cut out one can of the green salsa and there's still lots of liquid.  I didn't have any fresh lime on hand so I used bottled lime juice and it was tasty, but fresh would have been so much better!  It definitely needed it to brighten the taste.  I didn't think it was too spicy at all and will use more jalapenos next time.  This made an absolutely delish lunch for work - I love getting excited about my lunch breaks.

Awesome! We all loved it! I used two 16oz bottles of salsa verde instead of 5 cans of green salsa, and italian style diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this recipe again. My hubby & I loved it, and my toddler-daughter who usually won't eat meat ate quite a bit of it. It was very easy to make and the pork was so tender! Thanks for posting this recipe.

Made this for a potluck and it was delicious and very easy.  Served it with sour cream and fresh cilantro to spoon in.  Easy to adjust heat with less or more jalapenos.  Next time will include some lime juice as one reviewer suggested, and cut back on jalapenos but add some roasted anaheim chilis.  Very, very good.

I've made this recipe many times and it's always delicious. It works with chicken as well as pork and it's tasty and has added nutrition if you add beans (I use black beans) and corn as well. I serve over rice with sour cream. You can't go wrong with this recipe and you can easily tweak it to your taste. Yum!

WOW!!! My family loved it. I used 1 can of Rotel and a 320z jar of La Victoria Salsa Verde instead of of the canned jalapenos, tomatoes, & salsa verde.  Really easy meal with excellent flavor!

This was awesome. I skipped the tomatoes and used a jar of salsa verde and about 8oz of verde enchilada sauce. I also cooked on low for probably about 9 hours rather than starting on high and reducing temp. Served on tortillas with jack cheese and avocado. So good!

My goodness, this was delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty close.   I used Mexican style stewed tomatoes and I added 2 small cans of green chiles, 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn.  I forgot to get the jalepenos and substituted several good shakes of red chile pepper.  Ive never cooked pork shoulder before and the cut I bought had a good sized bone in it.  I cubed the meat off of it the best that I could, but the bone still had lots of good meat in and around it.  I simply threw the whole bone in with the rest of the meat.  I cooked on low for 9 hours and by the time we ate the meat was tender and falling off the bone. MMMmmm good.  This recipe will be one I use to impress company!

I modified this recipe the following way and it was spectacular!  I added one packet of taco seasoning to the pork while browning and instead of using green salsa I used three cups Medium hot Pace Picante sauce , added one large green pepper, used one medium onion, two tbsp minced garlic, one fresh Jalapeno diced, and added one can of Kidney beans drained, one can of Black Beans drained.  It was a little too watery so I added flour to thicken it up.  Cooked on Low setting for 8 hours.  Everyone at my football party loved it!

Wow, this was fabulous!  I used two 16 oz. jars of La Victoria Thick 'n Chunky Salsa Verde and a can of Rotel.  I saved a step and did not cube or brown the meat.  Just cut it in half so I could trim some of the fat off. The cook time is plenty with the roast whole or half.  I cooked mine on low for six hours, shredded the meat then cooked another hour.  Served over rice with sour cream and cilantro.  Mmmm, really good!  Will wrap some of the leftovers in tortillas for lunch.  Can't wait!

This was very good. The meat was very tender after 6 hours on low and the flavor was great. If I didn't have to make it for my children, I would've put in more heat (my preference). The only thing that I had a problem with was that it was too soupy. That may have been because I had to modify somewhat since I didn't have any green salsa - I only had one can of green enchilada sauce. I also added a can of black beans. But I can't imagine that adding 4 more cans of sauce would've made it any less soupy, just more green. I ended up putting a little cornstarch in it to thicken it up while I continued to cook it with the lid off. I paired it with Best Spanish Rice (from this website). I'll probably make this again but play with it a bit.

This is good if you like SPICY! I love spicy, but it was a bit too much for me. Next time I think I will omit the jalapenos. Great flavor though, the meat was very tender and juicy. Cooked on Low setting for 7 hrs. Followed other reviewer suggestions and browned the meat with a packet of taco seasoning. Also added a can of corn and kidney beans (drained), cumin and served over rice. Very good, will make again (minus the jalapenos)!

Great concept.  I couldnt find salsa in cans, tho.  The first time I made this I used 3 jars of Herdez green Salsa. We found it a bit bland that way.  The second time I monkeyed with the R & D version.  I used a large jar of La Victoria green, half a jar of the Herdez--it was leftover in the fridge--a huge sweet onion, lots of chopped garlic and a couple teaspoons of cumin. I omited the tomatoes completely and squeezed the juice of two limes in on top.  I let it all cook, covered for 8 hours.  Then I broke the meat apart in the sauce and let it simmer another hour uncovered to thicken up the sauce.  This one was delicious and everyone at my house deemed it a keeper. We had it the first night served over basmatti rice cooked in chicken stock and lime juice.  A dollop of sour cream was the only finish.  For leftovers, the kids rolled the rice and beef in burritos with cheese.  A super multi-tasking meal that works for my whole family.

This was good, I added juice from two limes, more garlic, and slightly less tomato. It was missing something for sure, I am going to keep working on it.

Fantastic recipe!  I made the changes recommended by others:  add 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin, 1 can black beans (drained), 1 can corn (drained), juice of 1 lime, and chopped cilantro.  I served on top of white rice with cilantro and lime juice and added a tablespoon of sour cream on top of each bowl.  It was so good I sent the revised recipe to my son in college so he can make it in his crock pot!

I made this again using chicken instead and it was perfect. The heat was just right for me. I followed the recipe exactly other than to change the meat and added corn and black beans. My company loved it! The first time i made it with pork i didn't like it as much but it may have been the cut of meat i got. It was way to greasy.You can't go wrong with b/s-less chicken breasts though and definitly try it with black beans and corn. YUM!

I really wish I could have given this more stars but I changed the recipe so much I just cant rate it higher. I exchanged the salsa for 1 can of green las palmas sauce and the tomatoes for tomatillios. I also added salt pepper and cumin. But I did LOVE this and am enjoying the leftovers very much!

I'm a huge fan of Mexican food... I followed Apr. 22, 2007 by burkeoj 's advice, added corriander, cumin, salt and lime juice. I added more garlic, omitted Jalapeños (kids don't like them) and pour a can of Green Enchilada sauce instead of the green salsa. and replaced Tomatoes for a smal 10 oz can of green chopped tomatillos and added homony! YUM!!!  ..  I made this yesterday, started at 3pm....Slowed cooked it for 4hrs on high, then switch to low for 2hrs... I couldn't wait any longer and had a little bowl myself...It was AMAZING.

Yummy!!! As a mama of 6, I am always trying new recipes out on my family. I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit! I used Herndz green salsa and stewed tomatoes with jalepenos, and left out the can of jalepnos....that way I still got some heat, but not so much that my little ones wouldn't eat it. I took the advice of others and added corn and black beans. Lastly, once it was all assembled in the crock pot I set it on low for 6 hours (although, if it had been longer before I could get to it, it would have been fine), and it was wonderful. My husband kept picking at it before I could even get it to the table. We served it with rice, tortillas, salad, sourcream and pepperjack cheese. I want to add that this makes a lot, that even with 8 of us eating there were tons of leftovers, very nice. This is one I'll definitely be adding to my family cookbook, THANK YOU!

This smelled soooo good but unfortunately was  too spicy for my daughter and me. I even omitted the jalapeno's because of my daughters pickiness! Also, I added flour to help thicken it but still felt there was too much liquid. I will definitely make this again with a few changes~mild instead of medium green salsa and less liquid by reducing the number of cans from 5 to 2.5 cans. I will not be adding jalapeno's but canned corn was a nice addition. Garnish with cilantro and sour cream.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times. The meat is flavorful and tender every time! It is great exactly like the recipe, but sometimes I do add some diced potatoes and eat it as a soup. Either way, you can't go wrong.

My whole family loves this stuff.  I often just make it with one big jar of green salsa instead of the five small cans.  Safeway Select brand is so spicy it doesn't need the jalapenos. I serve them on the side.  Makes a nice big batch, first night over rice in bowls, second night in tortillas!  Very authentic.  My husband, who was raised in Mexico, loves it!  Thanks for a keeper.

Great chile verde recipe.  I didn't change any of the ingredients and it was perfect!  I am at work during the day so I couldn't change the temperature mid-way through as suggested.  I used the low setting for 7.5 hours and it turned out great.

MMM-MM Good!
After cutting the pork shoulder into 1" cubes, I seasoned it with taco seasoning mix then browned the meat in batches.
I also cooked the onions, garlic and tomatillos in the same pan to get all the fond from the bottom of the pan.
I served it with cilantro rice --- the end result was great!
Thanks for sharing...

This is a great start but I think it tastes better with fresh diced jalapenos. Also I always add corn (frozen), potatoes (fresh) and black beans (canned and drained). All 3 are really cheap and basically fat free. Saves you money and makes the meal healthier! My version ends up very spicy (because I use ~4-5 whole jalapenos and a mix of green salsa and green enchilada sauce) so I like to top it with low-fat sour cream or non-fat Greek yogurt.

My family loves this recipe!  It's so easy and so delicious.  What I also enjoy is that you can serve it various ways.  We use tortillas as a side with it so we can use them to scoop up every drop.  We've also enjoyed this with rice and with fajitas.  It has a spicy but tangy flavor that I can't get enough of.

I have set aside my long cooking, fairly complicated chile verde recipe for this wonderful rendition.  After reading others' comments, and needing to double the recipe, I opted for half Hernandez salsa and half store brand salsa verde.  Please, please don't tell anyone how easy this is!

We love this recipe served over rice, with warm flour tortillas on the side to use as "bread." We add sour cream to cut the spiciness a little.

My family loved this!  I used La Victoria salsa verde, medium hot, RoTel mexican diced tomatoes with lime juice & cilantro, and skipped the jalapenos.  I also sprinkled about 2 Tbsp of flour on the pork after browning.  My husband says this is a definite keeper!

Nuts to my family... This was right up my alley.  First off, I skipped the whole "browning" process.  Simply chopped up the meat, and threw it in the crock pot.  Then, I dumped in 2 - 16 oz LA PREFERIDA Salsa Verde (Medium), Penzey's Chicken Taco Seasoning, Garlic powder, chopped onion, lime juice, 1/4 can of black beans, diced tomatoes with chiles, corn and cilantro.  I did, however, skip the jalapenos because I thought my kids were gonna eat this... They didn't.  Nice heat regardless.  I didn't make anything to go along with it - just ate it plain, lapping up every last drop of the delicious broth it left behind.

Very good. This is supposed to be a bit soupe, it is a version og "Guisado". Use one less can of salsa, add black beans, mexicorn, cumin, corriander, and cilantro. Use the jalapenos at your discretion. You can always add more!

I've made this recipe quite a few time and we love it. I leave out the jalapenos because the salsa I use is spicy enough for us. I made it again today and didn't read the recipe. I forgot to brown the meat and add onion and it was still delicious (and even easier). I should also add that I have no idea what kind of pork I used since it was pre-cut and just called "pork stew" meat. That might make a difference as to whether you have to brown the meat or not.  I love recipes that I can't screw up no matter how hard I try. Thanks!

Absolutely the best flavor.   At the end, i did mix up about 1/4 cup corn starch/water mixture in to thickn just a tad.  I made up some scrambled eggs and put the soupy mixture over the eggs, heated up some corn tortillas, then rolled one tortilla up, dipped into mixture, took a bite, dipped into sauce again, another bite, yes, double dipping but its your own bowl and dont even need a fork.
Definately a keeper recipe!  I made it exactly as written except for the cornstarch at the end.
Highly recommend this with scrambled eggs!
my step dad who is picky, loved it

Couldn't be easier.  Make it for the family, and everyone loved it.  I started it in the morning  before everyone arrived, and I could enjoy the company.  Complete hit, and very little left over.  thank you!

It was very spicy.  I may have put too many jalapeno's in it.  I would suggest adding a can of corn to it right at the end - as well as a can of diced tomatoes.  The tomatoes tend to cool it off.  I also added some fresh cilantro and sour cream.  Delicious!

Superb. We skipped a lot of steps, just cut up a boneless pork roast from Costco and threw it in a crock pot with everything else. It sat overnight and in the morning we just put it on low and went to work. It cooked about 9 hours on low and was very, very good.

4/15/11 I have made this recipe more times than I can count and I think I have gotten at least 10 people hooked on it! My co-worker's husband thinks I'm the best cook EVER! hahaha! I do add black beans (homemade or canned that have been drained & RINSED) at the start and corn (frozen or canned) for the last hour or so. Versatile, easy and delicious, no matter how you modify it!

This recipe is right on the mark and super easy.  I did not change the ingredients but opted to use fresh (jalepeno) or homemade (green sauce) ingredients as much as possible. I feel that I have more control over the sodium/fat content that way. Just a note:  There is a difference in "Green Sauce" and a green salsa.  You can substitute with the salsa, but it would be best to change to a green enchilada sauce instead.  Otherwise, if you're going to use salsa, run it through your blender so it is completely smooth.

I used mild green salsa (from trader joes)the second time I cooked this and took the lid off the slow cooker after 4 hours and allowed it to cook another couple hours which made it a bit thicker consistency. Wrapped it in tortillas with a little mexican cheese and my husband LOVED it!

I used herdez green salsa and diced jalapenos. It was very tart and very very spicy. I loved how spicy it was but can't imagine anyone else being able to eat it. Very tart..almost needed sugar or something. will try again with different salsa

My husband and I loved this.  The green salsa I bought had a heat rating of hot, so I did not add the Jalepano peppers.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder, which I will increase the next time.  There was so much gravy that instead of making Spanish or Mexican rice I used some of the gravy to cook my rice in. We ate the pork and rice with sour cream and Mexican cheese wrapped in a tortilla.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe for a hearty, family meal.  Ours came out a little on the spicey side but was still super yummy and the pork was very tender.

Next time I'll make sure to use mild salsa and just a regular can of tomatoes and probably leave out the jalapeno entirely.

The following are the changes I made:

-used two jars of verde salsa (16 oz each) rather than canned salsa
-added one can of drained black beans
-added one can of drained mexicorn
-used one can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos in place of the canned jalapeno and can of tomatoes
-cooked the mixture on high for an hour, then on low for 8 hours (while at work) then put it back on high for another hour while I made corn bread
added about 3 Tbsp of chopped cilantro
added about 2 tsp of cumin

I could never have imagined that pork in chili could be so good or that green salsa could make such an excellent base for chili.

This was good. But, I agree with the others.. reduce the amount of salsa.  Also, its a MUST to add black beans, corn, lime, and cilantro (without these ingredients, it'd be bland)

This recipe turned out very well!  I used jalapeno salsa, which made it very spicy, but I made it for my fiance and I, and he LOVES spicy food.  He even requested that I make this dish again the following week!  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was super easy and delicious! My enire family enjoyed it...even the kids. We DO eat spicier foods than most so the recipe as is was perfect for us, but it should be easy to adjust for those of you who like milder dishes. 
Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!!!

good recipe for pork and the crockpot. A little spicy for my taste but my husband liked it (although based on his reaction I wouldn't claim it a new "favorite")As leftovers we put this in a tortilla wrap with salsa and sour cream and a little cheddar (kind of like a pork fajita I guess) and it was pretty tasty that way and the tortilla cut some of the spicy!

I have been looking for a good green chile recipe like what I would find in the Mexican restaurants back when I lived in AZ.  While I don't think this is it, I will say I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor it had.  It was very easy to throw together and the taste was pretty good.  I would likely make this again.

It is the perfect weekday meal. It was easy to make and very delicious. I used only 1 can of the green salsa and that was plenty. I typically smother my tacos with sour cream, cheese, and cilantro, however, I thought it was so flavorful that I didn't add anything. This will definitely be my new go-to meal when I am having a busy week.

This is a keeper! I cut up boneless pork ribs and added corn and black beans as others suggested, then served it with a squeeze of lime and chopped fresh cilantro...Delish! Ate it for lunch all week, and it only got better with time:) Thank you! Tastes authentic without all the fuss!

Gets better the next day! Used Mrs. Renfro's Hot Green Salsa and a mild green salsa and mixed them. Very tasty and will definitely make again this winter. Delicious with Jiffy corn bread.

very good.  Husband wanted me to make "real" verde  by cooking down the tomatillos myself. I didn't have the patience so I tried this one and he loved it and thought it was the "real" thing.

Colors and flavorings are amazing;  
added a few ingredients for heartiness like chopped green chilis, chopped green jalepeno, friholes negros, corn, cumin, and lime juice for a bright, refereshing soup or topping for any other entre.  This recipe will be a staple in my regular repertoire.

Fantastic....after tweaks. Used pork loin instead of shoulder. Seared before adding to crockpot. Used 3 onions & 10 cloves garlic. Pureed these together & satueed in same pan as the pork, after the pork was done. Added 2 & 1/2 cups chicken broth. Used large fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Added cumin, oregano & sea salt to pot. Broiled 3 poblanos, 2 jalapeno & 2 yellow/green bell peppers. Sweated in a bag. Peeled & pureed with 1 bunch fresh cilantro. All into the pot. On high until good & bubbly. Then down to low & left for 8 hours. Serve over steamed rice & topped w/ a sprinkle of pepperjack cheese.

Pretty good although it does not taste like real chile verde.  I found that it had a good amount of heat but overall the flavor was sort of one note.  If I make it again I will definitely add cumin, chiles, salt, and cilantro.  It's easy enough and not bad, just not as good as I had hoped.

Verde, verde GOOD!! Flavors were fabulous - as per the suggestions I added some cumin. The pork did come out a little dry - maybe I won't cook on high, and just low for 8 hours. Will make this again though! YUMMMEEEE!

This recipe was so easy to make, and has been requested again by everyone who has tried it.  If its a little spicy just have some limes handy to squeeze over it.  My husbands mother if from Mexico and makes everything from scratch.  So, I made this for my inlaws one night and it has been inlaw approved! Thank you!

Just wonderful. I did add a can of corn (drained) and black beans  (drained). I also added some salt and cumin. Just for fun next time I make this I am going to marinate the pork. I served it with tortillas.

Good, but a bit bland. I used Herdez tomatillo salsa. After I added some cumin and oregano, and let it simmer another hour, it was MUCH better. Served it with tortillas, over rice, with a dollop of sour cream on top. Yummy!

This is a very tasty, very easy recipe!  The only change I made was using one less can of the salsa and for me, I found it to still be a little too "soupy" especially for using the meat in burritos.  Overall though it was very tender and flavorful.

Great flavor. This was so easy and good. The only changes made were I used 1 1/2 cup Herdez green salsa and I used the Rotel tomoates with jalenpeno  instead of adding jalepeno to the can of diced tomatoes. I left it in the slow cooker on low for about 10 hours. Will make again.

This was a very helpful recipe. I did minor adjustments, the biggest one being that I used beef instead of pork. I also added the cumin, red pepper flakes, and used fresh peppers. This was actually my first "real" dish I've ever prepared and it came out fantastic. My husband was shocked in amazement that I cooked for him! It was perfectly spicy and just wonderful. I will make it again!

Great recipe!  I used a can of rotel tomatoes, 2.5 jars of medium green salsa (16.9 oz each), only half a can of jalapenos, and pork sirloin chops.  It turned out spicy and tasty.  I served it with tortillas.  Today I made chicken burritos and poured the chile verde on top.  Just what I was looking for!  Thanks.

Very good.  I don't like very spicy food, so I used less than 1/2 can of jalapenos and it was perfect for me.  I set out the extra jalapenos on the table for others to add if they wanted.  Leftovers make great tacos.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Followed the other reviewers advice of subbing enchilada sauce, omitting jalapenos, adding cumin for less spicy version. I don't precook anything, just throw everything in the slow cooker and let her rip!

We've had Verde out many times and never attempted to make it at home until I saw this recipe and how simple it was.  This was simple and very tasty!!  We enjoyed it the first night over Basmati rice and the second night we drained the Verde as much possible and put them in burrito shells, rolled them, and baked for 20 minutes and topped them with the Verde sauce and baked for an additional 10 minutes...delicious!

Whoa this is spicy. Just made this today. It was very good. I made rice and put the chili verde over it. Very yummy but if you can't handle spicy, this isn't the recipe for you. My mouth is still burning a little!

Made this today for dinner exactly as directed - delicious! And easy! Would recommend to anyone. There is a slight "kick" to it, but the meat is very tender and the sauces make it amazing. Thank you for sharing!

It was good! I eliminated the can of tomatoes; wish I had a can of tomatillos to throw in. Added a can of dices green chilies and another can of diced jalapenos because we like it spicy in my house. Needed salt. I'll probably follow reviewer Donna's recipe next time just to see. I've been a bit spoiled; my grammies and aunties make the best chili verde I've ever had, but I now live in a different state and haven't been able to recreate it without them, so I'm looking for new! :)

This was very good! I used a jar of verde enchilada sauce, and drained a jar of Picante verde garlic salsa, just added the veggies from it. I was afraid using the whole jar with the juice would make it too thin. There is a lot of liquid, but it is so good I could drink it! Very good with rice.

Took this for a potluck and it was a hit!  I did use 1.5 jars of herdez salsa verde and 1 can of las palmas green enchilada sauce as other suggested.  I also added corn and black beans which people thought was weird until they tasted it.  I also omitted the canned peppers and used 2 fresh ones along with cilantro.  As others also suggested I added taco seasoning to the meat when browning.  Have made with and without potatoes and like it both ways.  With potatoes makes a good soup.  Without makes good burritos.

I took this to a party in the slow cooker to keep it warm, and it was a huge hit.  Every year during green chili season, I buy roasted chilies. I then peel them and sautee them with onion and garlic and freeze them in zip lock bags for later use.  So instead of the cans of green salsa, I used my frozen chilies, onions and garlic for this recipe. I served it with flour tortillas.

Super easy with really good flavor for a "non-cooker" like me. I cooked exactly per recipe minus 7 oz of salsa. My notes: I used a 3lb pork shoulder and by the time it all cooked down, it was enough for four moderate to big eaters. The shoulder meat is extremely fatty, so the longer it cooks the less fat is left on the meet (the chile was already cooked at 4 hours, but the cubes still had lots of fat on them.) I served over brown rice with a salad for a quick, tasty and easy dinner.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe as is and it was great.  I didnt have to add anything.  Its a bit to spicy for the kids but for adults who love this type of food.  This is absolutely perfect.  I like that you can use the left over for anything; burritos, chimichangas, or even enchiladas.  I will definitely be making this again except I'll add more meat to eat.  Great recipe!

Very good, & even though I did not make it exactly as directed I do feel comfortable with the 1 star deduction. I'd made carnitas the day before so I started out with roasted, browned pork seasoned with garlic powder, cumin, mexican oregano, salt & pepper along with a liitle bit of chicken broth that was already with the meat in hopes of moistening it up a bit. So to THAT I added 1/2 onion & 3 cloves of garlic - sauteed, four 7oz, cans of Herdez salsa verde, & 1 can of original Ro-Tel tomatoes. I allowed this to simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour so the flavors could permeate the already cooked pork meat & also to reduce the sauce. I definitely did not need to add any jalapenos as this was plenty spicy for us, & four cans of salsa verde were more than enough. Next time I may even reduce salsa to 3 cans & add more chicken broth.
So you see, I deducted the star because I can tell it wouldn't have enough flavor without the extra herbs & spices, & I definitely believe browning the meat contributes additional depth of flavor, & the chicken broth lets you keep the chile verde flavor, just not quite as concentrated.

Insanely yummy. I used pork tenderloin bc that's what I had on hand. I also used canned green Heredez salsa (personal favorite) and added canned cannelini beans. Juicy, flavorful, delicious and EASY!! Even better the next day! Thank you for a great recipe!

Would use the bigger piece of pork - but excellent!  I took someone's advice and used one jar of chili verde and one large can of green enchilada sauce.  Also,   I bought some diced tomatoes that already had the jalapenos in it. Yummy.

This was ok, just not a favorite. I added an extra can of jalapenos and 2 cans of black beans.  There was way to much liquid.  I used 2 jars of Herdez Salsa Verde and think 1 would have been perfect. I most likely will not make again..

Great flavor and easy to make.  It does need some heat though.  The jalapenos don't really have enough for my taste.  I am also going to try it with canned tomatillos instead of the tomatoes but it was great as is.

Great recipe! To thicken it, crush up some tortilla chips and add to finished stew. It will not change the flavor. Instead of canned peppers, I sauted super cayanne peppers with the onion and garlic. Wonderful spice and flavor!

I'm rating this based on the modifacations I made. I couldn't find fresh jalapenos or fresh tomatillos so I used the canned version of both which, I realised, made the whole thing turn vinegary and weird. Also, I cooked the recipe on high for 4 hours instead of low for 6-7 hours and it after those 4 hours the meat was hard as a rock. Hoping to get the vinegar to evaporate a little and to get the meat to tenderize, I let it simmer on low overnight (7 hours) and it looked and smelled ok this morning and meat is like butter. So after 11 hours of cooking, I'm still a bit skeptical about the finished product, but I must admit, I really messed it up!

This was pretty good.  The meat was pretty fatty so I might get a better cut next time.  Really good served with warm tortillas.  I also added black beans, corn, cumin, and coriander as recommended by some previous reviews.  I also used much less jalapenos.

I forgot the tomatoes in this recipe and it was still easy and scrumptious... my favorite dish at our local mexican restaurant is pork chili verde or green pork enchilidas and this is even better than that.  My family loved it and we will make it again, regularly!

I gave it 5 stars because the meat turned out excellent.  It was moist and tender.  I think next time, I will use a different sauce.  The store only carried a HOT green salsa, and it was even too hot for my husband who loves spicy food.  I even omitted the jalapeno peppers.  If you like spicy hot, this is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe and my mom did too. After I bought the salsa verde I realized that I bought the hot salsa verde so I left out the jalapenos. Next time I will get the medium salsa verde, and get a leaner cut of pork.

Brought this to a work birthday party and it went quick!  I thought it had a great taste.  I used Nacho sliced jalapenos in place of the canned and the heat was just perfect.  I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I made this following the instructions the first time and we both loved it.  But, because we are fans of all things super spicy, we made some modifications for the second.  Instead of the jar of jalepenos, we used 3 fresh jalepenos, 5 fresh serranos, and 4 habaneros.  The heat was amazing.  Topped it with sour cream and cheddar cheese and we ate a double recipe with a friend.  Delicious.

This was pretty good!  I will be making my own salsa verde next time around.  It made for an easy meal.  I spent the day shopping and all the while, dinner was cooking!

I didn't care for this at all but my two kids thought it was okay. It was really greasy.

I only used 1 1/2 tsp of  jalapenos and it was perfect for us lightweights with the HEAT! 
Everything else was perfect. We'll be making this often!

I've never eaten salsa verde so I don't know what this is 'supposed' to taste like. I followed the recipe exactly. It is delicious, but WAY too hot! My husband likes spicy food, and he also thought it was too hot. I will definitely cut the jalapenos in half next time. Browning the meat in a pan took a while - too long to do before work. Next time I will either brown the meat the night before or skip that step.

Simple yet flavorful!  I improvised by using instapot (soup/stew setting)  instead of slow cooker. Also, substituted one can of green enchilada sauce and one can of green salsa for 5 cans of green salsa (that's what I had on-hand) and added a couple of chopped red potatoes.  Will definitely make this again!

I have used La Victoria salsa verde which is a thicker consistency, Herdez which is a thinner consistency, and even green enchilada sauce, each of which work great. I add 1.5 teaspoons each of cumin and ground coriander, and 2 tablespoons lime juice, and I substitute 6-7 quartered fresh tomatillos for the canned tomatoes for authenticity. In an Instant Pot I’ve used the Chile/soup setting (high pressure) for one hour and then I add a bunch of chopped cilantro after it is done cooking. I have substituted chicken for pork and it’s good also but not as good as the pork.

I really enjoyed this! However, it was much hotter than I expected. I had planned on serving cheese and sour cream with it, but ended up not having any on hand. That would have helped. I did serve cornbread with it, which helped some. But, we had a couple of people sweating :)
Next time I'll just find medium hot jalapenos instead, and be sure to have cheese and sour cream. For those who like really hot, use the jar of hot peppers like I did. Or, find a milder jar.
Ultimately, I will make again. Very tasty!!

I followed Donna LeMaster's instructions---I live on the Texas New Mexico border, and my relatives are from both states, so I know authentic.   This was very good.  I did mine from start to finish in a six-quart saucepan.  I used beef instead of pork, I added a minced  fresh jalapeno and threw in  strips of roasted Anaheim peppers.   Serve with a pot of pinto beans and hot tortillas.  You can also roll up in a burrito with pintos and Spanish rice.  Muy delicioso!

One of our favorite dinners! I always follow the add-ins that the first commenter on this recipe had recommended. Yummy— a major crowd-pleaser in my family. It also heats and freezes well. I serve over white rice or Mexican Rice III from this site, and we usually have it with tortilla chips and a Mexican-themed salad.

I trimmed as much fat as possible off the roast before cubing and browning. Also drained the fat before putting in slow cooker. The smell about drove me crazy all day. Served over rice with sour cream and cheddar cheese on the side. This is a great recipe. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I used a combo of pork belly and ribs. And made my own green sauce with roasted tomatillos, roasted each of poblano, Serrano and jalapeño peppers. Added a tablespoon of lime juice and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro near the end. The pork was incredibly tender. Will make Chile verde in the slow cooker from now on.

Didn't use the canned tomatoes and substituted diced poblanos for diced jalapenos (hubs adds Tapatio to his). Love this simple, quick recipe and make it every few months.

I made it exactly to the recipe and won a chili cook off last year with it.  People appreciated that someone actually made a hot chili.  I made it the other night and only used 1/2 the jalapeños and not quite as much salsa as called for and served over white rice for family.  It was a hit.

I followed the advice of some of the reviewers, using 2 bottles of Herdez Salsa Verde instead of the canned chilies.  I also used a fresh jalapeno pepper, 4 cloves of garlic and added 1/2 tsp of coriander and 1 can of italian stewed tomatoes.  It was wonderful!

This has way too much pork and has no-body.  Add 2-3 small potatoes diced and some cumin.  Pork should have bones and they should be cooked with the meat to make an extraordinary stew.

This recipe was so easy and tasty. I used a can of Green Chilies instead of Jalapenos just because I like a milder taste. One night we had it over rice. We also had it alone with corn bread and salad. I also used leftover pork from a roast I had. It was sooo tender.

This was a delicious, slightly spicy soup that is an excellent way to warm up during cold weather.  I've made it with pork and chicken, and both times it was delicious.  I only use 1/2 a can of diced jalapenos and that is plenty spicy for us.  The 2nd time I made this I used 28 oz of medium chile verde sauce, and thinned it out a bit with chicken broth, and served it over brown rice.  That is now my favorite way to make it.

This product is a soup, not a chili, which was very disappointing. And that was after I added beans and corn. Nice flavor but the consistency is all wrong. If I were to make again I'd just make it on the stove

I have made this several times, using some tweaks as suggested from other reviewers, replacing the salsa with enchilada sauce and the tomatoes with tomatillos.  I like to make a bunch it and freeze it.  It is good for breakfast with eggs and for dinner with beans and rice.

I used a Boston Butt Roast.  Cooked it in the crockpot for 12 hours with green chills, garlic, onion, salt pepper, and whole jalapeños with chili verda sauc.  The meat fell apart and was moist and tender.  I removed the fat and it was enjoyed by all.  I browned the roast on all side in a iron skillet with salt and pepper before putting in the crockpot.

This was my first time making chile verde. The recipe gets a 10 for flavor and a 10 for ease. Added cumin, white pepper and lime juice as mentioned in other reviews. Cooked on low for about 8 hours. Meat was very moist.

I liked a lot, Isaac thought was okay but agreed it was better with sour cream the 2nd bowl. Sandra made this and added cumin, cilantro, whole kernel corn, hominy while cooking and then lime, sour cream to serve.

One of the better things I've made. I only change a few things slightly. I used 4 cans of Herdez Salsa Verde, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 tsp. ground coriander, 2 tbsp. lime juice, 1 entire yellow onion chopped roughly and since it was still a little thin and watery when finished, I thickened it with a 4 tbsp. of corn starch and 4 tbsp. water slurry in the last five minutes. Total cooking time was 7 hours on High. The family raved over it and my hair baby is s a huge Chile Verde fan at the local big chain Mexican Restaurant and this beats theirs by a million votes! Served it with rice, beans and grilled flour tortillas.

Im a squeamish meat eater and so when I caught a look of the pork shoulder in the grocery store I quickly opted for the boneless trimmed chicken thighs as a sub and never looked back!  The recipe turned out amazing!  The chicken thigh stayed very moist and worked well with the recipe (I shredded the meat after 5 hours and let it simmer the rest). I also doubled the chopped onions and tripled the garlic but left the rest true to recipe.

I substituted boneless, skinless chicken thighs, used Safeway verde salsa - 1 large jar.  I sauteed garlic and frozen chopped onions in the instant pot, then added the chicken (large chunks) for a few minutes of sauteing.  Added verde salsa, a couple tablespoons of jarred jalapeno slices, a cup of pureed tomatoes and pressure cooked for 15 minutes.  After the pressure naturally released, I added a scant cup of white rice and a cup or so of chicken broth and cooked it again for 15 minutes.  Excellent!  One pot meal!

This was absolutely amazing! Better than buying tomatillos and creating your own sauce.
It was so good and easy, it was like cheating. My boyfriend loved it.  Ladies, make this for brownie points. The changes I made: I used 4 lbs of meat instead of 3. 7 oz of jalapeno peppers instead of 4oz. Cooked it on low for  11 hours.  
Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. No additional seasoning.  I love my food with extra sauce, and I agree with another review, you can do with one less can green salsa. 
I will make this for the  next potluck I go to.  This should be a 6 star recipe!

Made a few tweaks to the original - used 4 cans salsa verde, two whole brown onions, 4 cloves garlic, tablespoon chicken bouillon, dash of cumin, dash of pepper - slow cooker on low 8 hours (overnight).   Was outstanding!  Definitely make again.

We really enjoyed this, and it was pretty easy too. I followed the recipe almost exactly for the most part, but browned the pork in batches and did the onions and garlic separately because my pan wouldve been too crowded to do it all at once. I also left out the jalapenos because we have a toddler. we served it with white rice, tortillas and sour cream and it was very tasty. I'll definitely make this again, and won't change anything. I recommend doing yourself a favor and making the original recipe before you start adding things and making significant changes based on other reviews.

So good! I made this for a Superbowl party for the first time. Everyone loved it! Next time I'm going to add a tablespoon of pork bouillon for a little more taste. I served it with tostadas, cabbage and radish. Would be great with queso fresco also.

I took the others advice and I did the following: Cooked on high for 4 hours and used 1 onion chopped, 2-3 cloves of garlic chopped, used 19oz can La Victoria Enchilada Sauce Mild Chili Verde, used 16oz jar of La Costena green mexican salsa (medium), 16oz jar la Victoria salsa verde thick and chunky (mild), 16oz jar Simple Organic Truth tomatillo medium salsa, 4oz can Hatch diced green chilis (hot), 1 large Anaheim pepper shredded without seeds, 2-3oz of canned diced jalapeño peppers, 15oz can corn drained, 15oz can of black beans (rinsed), 1/2 tablespoon cumin. Added all to crock pot. Then added 4 still frozen free range chicken breasts  2-3 hrs before end of cook time. Checked chicken after 2 hours and if cooked I shredded and then served with cabbage, brown rice, diced raw onion, diced cilantro, sliced avocado and a squeeze of lime. It was heavenly!!!!

Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used roughly the same weight (14 oz) fresh grape tomatoes, boiled them & pureed them into a chunky consistency, also added cumin & coriander like suggested by "burkeoj". One of the best dishes I have ever made according to my husband. Brought a little bit to work to see if I could change the mind of a co-worker that is a self - proclaimed *shudder* "pork-hater". She asked me for the recipe because she LOVED it! Another co-worker compared the dish to a highly addictive drug. Success!

I have made this recipe as is so many times and it always, always gets rave reviews!!  I like to serve it over rice for dinner.  If there are any leftovers, I have it for breakfast with a fried egg over the top.  
One reviewer said they were going to add some roasted anaheims next time.  I think that is brilliant idea!!!

Was delicious .. I had a bone-in pork shoulder that I de-boned, cubed and seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin and Emeril's essence .. browned in the olive oil then added to the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients, leaving out the jalapenos, I also seared the bone because of the rest of the meat attached and added it to the chili.  Sauteed the onions and garlic in the meat drippings de-glazing the pan with a little marsala wine and adding in 1 - 15 oz can of black eyed peas .. Will make again

I had never eaten chile verde before making this last week, but have friends who frequently order it at restaurants so I wanted to give it a shot.  I did smoke the pork in an electric smoker for 50 minutes prior to adding it to the slow cooker mixture so that reduced overall cooking time.  I used Green Chile Sauce from New Mexico Foods and like other reviewers, also added corn, black beans, smoked paprika and cilantro to the mix.  My version may have been far from traditional, but we loved the smoky, earthy flavors in this SUPER EASY chile!

Great base. I threw in a handful of white rice to thicken, fresh lime juice and cilantro  for depth.
Green enchilada sauce is a better fit if you have kids; and cumin is a must. 
Love it.

I LOVE chile verde and thought I would give this easy recipe a try. It was a bit late in the day to use the crock pot, so I used my dutch oven on the stove top.  I let it simmer for a few hours to ensure the meat was tender. The flavor was great! Next time I will allow more cooking time so the meat can get to the tenderness I was looking for. Hey! I know...maybe I'll use the crock pot ;) Thank you for the recipe!

yum. made this a few days and it was a huge hit. i used fresh jalapeno by accident and loved it. make sure to drain water from meat after browning. I added cornstarch to thicken it at the end, since it seemed too watery. we ate 8 people.

I have to confess, I've never eaten "authentic" chile verde, so I don't know how this compares.  But just judged on its own merits, this dish is WONDERFUL.  Made it today and my husband and I both think it's a keeper -- very tasty, with just the right amount of heat.  I read all the reviews and made the additions many people suggested:  corn, black beans, cumin, coriander, lime juice, salt and pepper.  Also, my grocery didn't have pork shoulder, so I used a pork sirloin roast, which is a leaner cut and probably made it less soupy and/or greasy than what some reviewers described.  I'm giving this 4 stars because, if prepared as written (without the additional ingredients), I feel it would have been a little bland for our tastes.  But if you're going to be serving it to children, or others who prefer less spice, the original recipe (perhaps with fewer jalapenos) would probably be the better choice.

This came out great!  I couldn't find stewed tomatillos as one reviewer said to use so I just followed the recipe.  It was so yummy and the meat was so tender.  This makes a lot so I ended up freezing a good portion of it for a later "lazy day" dinner.

This recipe was really good!  My husband and I enjoyed it.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. I used rotel for the canned tomatoes and thats the only change I made.  We put the mixture in burritos and poured more of the sauce over the top with some cheese.  So good!  I will be making this recipe again!

This was wonderful! I had it the first night then the next 3 days. I used 2 bottles of La Victoria Thick-n Chunky Salsa Verde medium and I can of rotel.No problem with to much liquid. No jalapenos, but will add next time. I added the corn but not next time. Going camping soon and I'm planning on making this. Easy too

This was a great recipe. Pretty spicey but we both like hot food.  Very easy to make. We used the corn torillas to soak up the juice.

This is a very easy recipe to prepare.  My husband and I liked it, but my teenage boys didn't.  I used rotisserie chicken..it really enhanced the taste.
