This was excellent! I made a few changes. First, I used a flank steak and made my own marinade with lime juice, oj, fresh jalapeños, cilantro, vinegar,  olive oil, fresh garlic, s&p. I also subbed plain brown rice for the Spanish  rice suggested in the recipe. Trust me, there are plenty of flavors that you won’t miss it. I wanted something a little cleaner/less sodium.  This dish would also be excellent with black beans, but the pintos were delicious.

My husband absolutely loved it.  The combination of flavors hit all the right notes with him.  I used NY strip instead of beef tenderloin, and I also grilled red/green peppers, the onion, and the tomato.
