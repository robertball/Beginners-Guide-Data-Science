Delicious! My 14 month old loves blueberries. He has been eating them like crazy the last few weeks. I wanted to try a something different for him. He loves popsicles, so I thought he would enjoy this. And he did! He was so upset when it was all gone! We are going to have to go back to the grocery store tomorrow for more berries so we can make it again.

this was a great recipe, perfect for using the bluberries that weren't so sweet to start with.  The color is beautiful and the taste was refreshing and not too cloying.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A little on the sweet side for me. Next I will try adding a little more lemon juice to get the tart flavor I love so much.

used blueberries from local farmer's market. Nice and refreshing. I cut down the sugar. Will try with other berries too. Very good

Made this for my husband and he LOVED it.  Shared it with my son and wife and they were crazy for it (my daughter in law does not care for blueberries)  AWESOME thanks.  Can't wait to try other fruit!

Made it like a sorbet in an ice cream maker.  Used honey for sugar and more lemon cuz I like it. Heavenly.
