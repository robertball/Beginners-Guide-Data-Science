Not too shabby for a yellow cake mix, which generally has an obnoxious artificial taste. I tried to work around that in advance by substituting apple juice for the water, adding a teaspoon of caramel flavoring and, as I always do with yellow cake mixes, a teaspoon of vanilla. I was concerned about the cake being too moist and falling because I used a pudding-included cake mix, but it turned out not to be a problem. The cake is nice and moist, with pleasant little chunks of apple, not adulterated with a bunch of pie spices or cinnamon, which I liked. Knowing the glaze just might soak into the cake, which I did not want, I reduced the amount of milk considerably, only using 1 T. (I used half and half) rather than the 3 T. called for. It worked just as I hoped it would, though I found I didn't need the 10 minutes sitting time as it started to thicken before that. To finish the cake, I topped it with chopped Heath Bars which made for a pretty presentation (chopped, toasted walnuts or pecans would have been good too). Nice autumn cake that was very simple and quick to make from start to finish.

This tasted like a typical cake mix recipe.  It made for a nice presentation though.

This cake is absolutely AMAZING! It is so moist and the tart apples with the caramels are just great. I've made this one several times and it is a great fall/Thanksgiving/Christmas dessert.

Good! Definitely heed the advice in the footnotes and do not use a cake mix with pudding in it. My little store didn't have one without pudding, so I took my chances and wound up with a cake that was bordering on too moist. Great flavor though! I did replace the water with apple juice and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake batter. I wanted my glaze to be a bit thicker so I only used 1 T of milk and threw in a few extra caramels. Lovely presentation. Thanks :)

My family loved this recipe!  I have made it countless times since I found it last fall.  After the first cake I made, I switched to a spice cake and I thought it was much better and that is the only way I make it now.  For shortcut when needed, caramel topping for sundaes taste great on the cake.

Great! I made this for my husband's crew at work and got lots of compliments (with profanity, even!). I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and butter flavoring to the batter. The cooking time/temp is spot-on. I'm looking forward to making it at home so I can try it. Thanks!

So, so good.  It's almost better the second day when the gooey caramel has seeped into the cake.  I bet it would be good with honey in place of the caramel too.

This cake was ultrs moist and flavour full, at first I didn't know if three apples would be enough but it worked out perfectly! Also the caramel on top was good too.

I liked this cake, but it was very very moist.  I put on the caramel topping after the cake had cooled completely and the caramel was cool but still soft.  The cake looked beautiful, but about two hours later, the caramel had absorbed into the cake or fallen off the cake and the cake looked mushy and old.  If you make this recipe for an event, I suggest waiting until the last second to put that topping on.

After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to making this cake. Our family found this very average. I do like the idea of the apples in the cake but it was a big disappointment in flavor. Not only will I not make this again, I am not tempted to even have another piece! Much better desserts out there to put my calories toward!

This cake did not taste like much other than a moist version of a yelow box cake mix. It was good for a one-time dessert but I won't be making it again.

Wonderful cake thats wonderfully easy to make; haven't tried the caramel sauce yet but the cake itself with just a little whip cream is great, Im sure the sauce will just add to the flavor.

Yum! I made this for my husband and all of his male co-workers. They loved it, even my husband who was raised on a farm with a mother who made everything from scratch! I did what some people suggested and only did 1tablespoon of milk, which was a great decision. I also, didn’t have to wait the 10 minutes for the caramel to thicken; it was ready right out of the microwave. One bigger change that I made was that I used chunky apple sauce INSTEAD of having to peel and chop the apples. I substituted the 3 apples for 3 cups chunky apple sauce and only ½ a cup of water. I will definitely be making this again!

My family did not like this at all. The apples just didnt really cook and the taste was just off. Sorry.
