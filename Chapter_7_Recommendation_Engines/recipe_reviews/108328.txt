Awesome slaw! It has a sweet yet nutty flavor and was absolutely delicious! I used a bag of coleslaw mix, added a couple tsp. of lime juice and instead of grating the jicama I cut it into matchsticks. I didn't have black sesame seeds, so I toasted my regular ones and added it. This was a great side dish to grilled "Pork Tenderloin Marinade" from this site. This is a definite keeper!

Awesome dressing in this slaw recipe! Just a tip: If you don't have sesame oil, don't even bother making this until you can get your hands on some. Sesame oil is super-packed with a nutty flavor (a little goes a long way) and without it, the dressing will be entirely different (i.e. bland!) than intended and will have virtually no Asian flavor at all. Great with a handful of toasted almonds tossed in!

Delicious.  I could eat the whole thing!  I made some changes, used one head green cabbage a and one head purple cabbage.  Didn't have sesame seeds, so omitted that. Added one orange , chopped up. For the dressing I used  half part mayonaise, half part plain yogurt, with a little bit of lime and orange juice added. So pretty and so good.  I served it with Kalua oven pork.  I am salivating just thinking about it.

I've lightened up the dressing by subbing 1/2 cup lowfat plain yogurt or lowfat sour cream and 1/2 cup light mayo and it was really good both ways.  The dressing would be good on any combination of cole slaw ingredients you have on hand but I love the addition of jicama.  I added some toasted slivered almonds, finely chopped red bell pepper, and green onions.  I've also just added the dressing to the packaged cole slaw mix with a little chopped jicama. I found that scaling the recipe in half yields enough dressing for one bag of coleslaw mix. Fantastic.

VERY good! I 'matchsticked' my jicama instead of grating and added a little lime juice. Otherwise made as directed. We'll have this again - thanks!!

My mom makes coleslaw during the summer for cook-outs.  She doesn't bother with making her own dressing and just uses store-bought dressing.  It was always too strong of a taste for me - I never enjoyed the heaviness and stickiness of it.  I've been meaning to find a recipe to make my own slaw dressing that doesn't shock the taste buds and is more refreshing and light, and I found the perfect opportunity to finally do it this week, when I saw bags of  cole slaw on sale.  I like to try unique recipes, so I decided to use this one.  It came out really well, everything that I was looking for: not overpowering, refreshing, and a bit different from the usual slaw dressings.  It had a great balance of sweet and tangy, but not strong, so it also gave a good balance of taste between the dressing and the vegetables.  I really enjoyed the hint of a "nutty" flavor from the sesame oil and sesame seeds, and I absolutely love that this recipe uses honey.  The proportion of dressing to salad was perfect in the recipe, as well.  I did make some minor changes, but only because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used white balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar, white sesame seeds instead of black, and I didn't have jicama.  Not sure how much of a difference this made, but I was happy with the end result.  I made the slaw a day ahead, and the flavors blended really well during this time in the fridge. Will make this again!

Wow - I love this slaw!  First time I have ever used jicama - not sure how necessary it is to this salad - pretty much tasteless to me - mine had the consistancy of a firm pear is the only way i can describe it.  So I certainly wouldn't fret if you couldn't find one or didn't want to waste the money. I also couldn't find black sesame seeds so I just used toasted sesame seeds.  I used low fat mayo and the dressing was still incredible.  This slaw would be great on any kind of bbq sandwich or with a couple crab cakes perched on top which is what I used it for.  All I can say is wowzer - will definately use this again.

My bad for using Napa cabbage as I think the problem was the dressing was too heavy for the delicacy of the Napa ... after ready reviews (looking for help and TY AR tasters!), I went back and added more jicama, only jullienned this time, not grated.  That, along with a healthy dose of lime juice, brought it back to life.  I also threw in some baby bok choy I had for additional crunch.  I'd kill for some almonds right now!

This was wonderful.  I will certainly make it again.  Served it with pulled pork sandwiches.  I only used 1T of honey, which was perfect for our family; a little sweet but not too sweet.  Also added chopped cilantro and green onion.  I think next time I can cut back on the mayo.  I'm sure it would be plenty good with less.  Also, it only sat for an hour and was wonderful.

I knew I had a jicama in the refrigerator so I went out and bought a smallish head of cabbage.  Also, I had carrots (who doesn't) so I thought I had all the ingredients for this recipe.  Unfortunately, when I dug out the jicama, it was moldy so I had to run down the street to hated Walmart to buy another one.  Just some backstory, no reflection on the recipe. So anyway.  I had to use a combination of ff yogurt and lite mayo.  I've been put on a serious diet by my doctor.  I added a little lime juice, and since I had the lime out anyway, I grated some zest and put it in the slaw as well.  I let the slaw rest for the prescribed 4 hours and then tasted it.  It was a little dry.  I added a bit more rice vinegar, but it still seemed like it was missing something.  So I dug out and added some mysterious Chinese seasoning called "Salt Spice" that I picked up at the International Market. (the ingredients say "salt, spice" too).  That seemed to do the trick and we enjoyed this dish very much.  Thanks for the post, Celeste.

Good slaw.  Nice to find a recipe that isn't all mayonaisy.  The lime juice is a nice touch.

Delicous! I had no jicama on hand, so I had to omit that, and I used a bag of slaw mix, which worked perfectly. The dressing is wonderful...be sure to use the sesame oil, it really is key and makes it extra yummy! Loved the honey in this, as well. This is a definite keeper...Thanks for sharing, Celeste! :)

My wife being Korean doesn't like things too sweet. I must confess I eased up on the honey and added more sesame oil. The biggest trick in cutting the veggies the same thickness. We loved it! Got to practice my knife skills.

Excellent recipe! I admit I was sceptical, but it is delish. I used Tahini (no sesame oil) and added toasted almonds, knock your socks off good. The problem is waiting for dinner to scarf it down. The family may not get to taste this after all.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, but heeded other reviewers advice and cut my jicama into matchsticks. I also didn't have black sesame seeds (so didn't use them) and didn't have honey, so I sub'd brown sugar. The flavor of the dressing is so yummy. I was so excited to eat my salad when it was first assembled, but after sitting in the fridge for 3 hours, it lost a lot of it's flavor. Next time I make this, I will dress the salad right before I serve it. As other reviewers also noted, if you do not have sesame oil, don't bother making this salad!!

Very nice! The sesame oil was perfectly subtle which I liked. I think I will thin out the mayo and use less honey next time. I added chili oil to it for a little kick.

The dressing is delicious. I followed the recipe for the dressiong and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. I omitted the jicama and black sesame seeds, but I don't think it took away from the finished slaw. I served it at a potluck where it was a big hit.

The dressing really makes it - I used Best Foods Real Mayonnaise because it's not as sweet and heavy as many others. I don't really care for coleslaw as a rule (I made it for the family), but this recipe has made me a convert!

This is our new all time favorite coleslaw. I'll never use sugar again in coleslaw. Thank you for a great recipe!

Revised: My husband and I started the Atkins Diet, I modified this recipe using 4 packets of Splenda instead of honey and it was still terrific!

Served alongside pulled pork sandwiches and it was goooooood....even those who don't normally like cole slaw tried and loved this recipe. I probably won't ever make another version of slaw...I tooke the advice of another reviewer and matchsticked the jicama which added a great crunch. I used one purple & one green cabbage and it ended up being enough for a party of 20! Would definitely encourage making the day before as the taste gets better the longer it's allowed to marinate.

Tastes like what I'd I've had in japanese restuarants. It's the sesame oil that sets this slaw apart from others. I forgot to add the honey but I did add a few splashes of mirin which is also a sweetner. Didn't have the black sesame seeds but did add sliced almonds & chopped scallion. Just "cuz I had a bit of lime that needed to be used, I added a small amount which I couldn't taste. Even the pickier eaters enjoyed.

Great!  I served with a vietnemese nuoc mam, golden fried tofu and tomato stir fry, and steamed white rice.  The flavors and varying textures worked so well and my family really liked it.   Even with the mayo, it still tasted wonderfully Asian. Thanks for an easy recipe!

I made this exactly as directed and thought it was pretty bland, but it looks like I'm in the minority here!  I wish I would have taken another reviewer's suggestion to julienne the jicama, because it lost a lot of its crunchiness when grated.  I think I'll stick with sal's blue cheese cole slaw from this site, but thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love this recipe. I did mess up because I was making the slaw and marinade for Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi. I accidently put minced giner in the slaw. To remedy my error, I used half of all the veggies and doubled the sauce and sesame seeds. It tasted great even with the blunder.

Nice side dish.  I'm not convinced the jicama add all that much to the flavor though.  Next time, I may try it with larger pieces instead of shredding it.  But really, it's probably just fine without the jicama.  This was a nice contrast to our spicy beef entree.

I used a combo of lite mayo and vanilla yogurt, less sesame oil and skipped the honey to lighten this up and served with satay chicken tenders.  SO GOOD!

I had some cabbage and some jicama to use up, which led me to this recipe. Just great! We added some shredded chicken as well. All it needed was a little salt and pepper.

I was looking for a good jicama slaw recipe when I came across this one.  Outside of subbing white sesame seeds for black I made exactly as written.  I enjoyed the nuttiness the sesame oil/seeds add.  I really liked this slaw, although I couldn't really identify the jicama in it.  My daughter who loves coleslaw was not a big fan of this version.  As written I rate it a very good 4.  I'll try some alterations next time....match sticking the jicama as others have done, as well I think I'll try adding some fresh pineapple bits to it to brighten it just a bit.

I was very happy with the results of this recipe.  I only added 3/4 cup mayo--I wanted to keep the calories down.  I added an extra Tablespoon of rice vinegar and a little salt and pepper.  Delicious.

When I first read this recipe I thought the dressing sounded amazing.  I didn’t have the jicama or black sesame seeds, but I wanted to make it any way.  All I can say is WOW!  The dressing absolutely makes this slaw wonderful, and IMHO the sesame oil in it is a must!  Thank you!  We’ll be making this one again soon!

Very delicious.  Crunchy and tangy and beautiful.  Next time I will add some shredded red cabbage also.  I actually liked the slaw best the first day.

I cut the mayo in half for a drier slaw and it turned out just fine.  I added cherry tomatoes, chopped red onion and chopped bell pepper.  I really like the sesame flavor in the dressing.  This is a home run recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Yum! I made only the dressing portion, so the rating is for that alone. I used a bag of shredded cabbage and a bag of rainbow slaw mix with the amount of dressing indicated in the recipe, and I think it was a bit too much dressing. Next time I think I'll add more shredded carrots, green onions, and some toasted almonds as other reviewers have suggested. It's nice to get away from traditional slaw, and this recipe was exactly what I hoped it would be.

This was pretty good! I took a shortcut and used a bag slaw mix. I also used toasted sesame seeds (white) instead of black ones.

We LOVE this recipe. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan but I could eat this all summer. Some reviewers complained it was bland, and while I have no idea how they could think so, I wanted to point out that the recipe calls for "sesame oil", but "toasted sesame oil" might even add a bit more kick. The sesame oil I think is behind a lot of the flavor in this slaw, if you are substituting, it won't taste right.

i'm not sure if i had gotten some unusually large vegetables or what, but this made a ton of coleslaw. it was delicious, so i didn't mind, but i think it made a lot more than 8 servings. but whatever, it was excellent.

I didn't have jicama on hand, so just added extra cabbage and carrot. Didn't tweak anything else.

Delicious! DIdn't have jicama on hand but I'm sure that would have made it even better. I was a little worried on the sesame oil amount but it was just right. Had it for a side with fish.

I didn't have any mayonnaise or honey, so I substituted cultured coconut milk and coconut nectar.  WONDERFUL!!  I didn't have jicama either, but I added crunchy red pepper strips.  I'll make this again. So easy!!

this was fantastic! I didn't have jicama but added some finely chopped onion. A little runny but maybe that was because I was little under on the mayo since I ran out...still great anyway!

Awesome!  I didn't have any jicama or sesame seeds, so I left them out, and added dried cranberries and toasted almonds.  If I'm not careful I'll end up eating it all myself!  Thanks for this.

I loved this, it reminded me of a slaw I had in N.Y. at a very upscale restuarant.
