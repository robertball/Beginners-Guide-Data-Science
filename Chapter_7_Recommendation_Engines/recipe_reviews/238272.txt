I was very excited to base my recipe off of Bill's. I gave a few tweaks because I wanted more from the kimchi. 

A few changes, added swiss chard, radicchio, peppers, shiitake mushrooms, in the initial ferment. Then used paprika and cayenne pepper, and extra ginger sliced, anchovies with fish sauce in the mix for the 2nd ferment before refrigeration. Oh, and I used a brine instead of tossing it with more salt. When fermenting foods it's important and cautious to used not too much but certain enough salt, so a brine after the initial ferment is fine with me.

It was too salty, I could not eat it.  Next time I will allow the cabbage to sit in the salt for a maximum of 6 hours and then ferment the finalized kimchi in their jars at room temp for a few days.

This is excellent! I halved the recipe and purposely left out the carrots due to personal preference but other than that stuck as close as I could to the recipe. They didn't have serrano peppers this time of year in my Hispanic market and I was going to use jalapeno but the store owner encouraged me to use piquillo peppers instead. They are tiny so I went ahead and used 3 of them even though I was halving the recipe. WHOA! They may be small but they pack some heat. I had a lot of fun making this and the worst part was the wait. Everything pretty much turns to mush once it has all sat for a couple of weeks but that is the point I guess. This came out a little more bitter than what I'd had in the past but I'm not sure if it was the fish sauce or perhaps the peppers I used? I'm not sure but I will make this again and probably stick with the chili flakes mentioned in the footnotes so that I can control the heat a little better. I also would have liked more green onion. All in all great recipe and I already cannot wait to do it again!

This is a good basic recipe with the exception of letting the cabbage/bok choy rest for days. This causes the vegetable to become mushy after the ferment. All the 'authentic' Korean recipes I have found suggest 3 to 10 hours. You want the thick parts bendy but still able to snap. I rested mine 3 hours before rinsing and draining. I also only added 1 Tbsp salt after the rinse. Once jarred, I left at room temp for 2 days until I could see fermenting action, then refrigerate.      ONE REVIEWER commented that hers was bitter - that was because she left out the carrots for personal preference. If carrots are left out or dramatically decreased, 1/2 a grated apple added will balance out the flavors and inhibit the development of bitterness. This is a common ingredient in Korean-made kim chi.  And remember, as Bill the original poster suggests, you can adjust to your preferences. More types of veggies, red pepper flakes and no fresh peppers, bulb onions in addition or instead of green onions, daikon radish or globe radish... it's up to you! I use kim chi on scrambled eggs, fried rice, like sauerkraut in sandwiches, with biscuits and gravy... the uses are endless.
