I seriously did not expect this recipe to work considering the hassles I experienced in making it.  My candy thermometer had disappeared, my power flashed thus resetting my computer and causing me to search for the recipe again in the middle of cooking, AND I had the help of a kitten!  Still, this turned out to be excellent fudge.  It does make A LOT - this is not a recipe a person wants to use as a two person dessert.

Super easy and a huge hit at an open house we brought it to. I will absolutely be making this again. Plan ahead to allow for the refrigerator time and set time. Also, I do not have a candy thermometer and used my meat thermometer. I got the sugar mix to 220 and kept it there for several minutes with no issued whereas the instructions call for 240.

Too rich and sat very heavy in my stomach.  Going to be leaving a layer of graham wafer or some other sweet cracker layer on the bottom to reduce the richness and to keep the chocolate from melting on my fingers.

This recipe takes a while but it is totally worth it. This recipe is one of the best recipes for fudge because most don't set right. This works out good but one change I would make is I would add more chocolate chips. The sweetened condensed milk is a little strong vs. the chocolate flavor and in fudge the chocolate flavor is supposed to be a little stronger. Overall this is a very good recipe.

The fudge is great!!! However the marshmallow stuff on top isn’t as good. I just use Marshmallow fluff
