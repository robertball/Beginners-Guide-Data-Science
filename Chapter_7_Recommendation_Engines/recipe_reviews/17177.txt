This dish was sooo good.  I had it for a baby shower and everyone loved it.  The only problem was cooking all those chicken breasts and cutting them up.  Once that was done it was a snap. I cut the recipe down to 1/2 of what it was supposed to be and still had tons left.  I definately recommend this dish but make sure you have someone help you cook the chicken.  It's kind of fru-fru so I don't think kids would like it too much but a room full of women and a mom-to-be loved it.

This was delicious. I made it for a small potluck so had to cut the recipe way down. I used one boneless skinless breast, 1/2 stalk celery, 1 1/2 cup mayo. 1/8 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup buttermilk. For the dill I just sprinkled it in but I think it was between 1/2 -3/4 tsp. and I used 1 lb. pasta.I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic then dipped it in a breadcrumb/parmesan cheese coating and cooked it. This was so good and everyone liked it.

Very good recipe to feed a crowd. Served at a baby shower, on two large platters, on bed of lettuce with quartered bright red tomatoes for garnish. Place extra dressing on side.

Suggestions: add shredded white cheddar cheese and really bump up the dill.  Couldn't find lemon penne, so I poured lemon pepper seasoning in the water, when boiling the pasta.  I grilled bone-in chicken breasts, loaded with the lemon pepper seasoning.  Still not enough lemon flavor, so I would recommend adding the seasoning to the dressing.  

If you make this the day before, be prepared to add more dressing, as the pasta soaks it up in the fridge.  

Got rave reviews and presented very elegantly!

This was pretty good, but not very much chicken.  It had a very unique light flavor and would probably be great for a summer gathering.  I will use this recipe again.

Rave reviews with many recipe requests from the 16 people I fed (with leftovers) for under $20! Quick, easy, cheap, healthy (see my dressing changes below), and delicious! As I consider recipes as more of a suggestion than an exacting science, here are the changes I made: Used breast&thigh meat from 2Costco roast chickens. Used plain penne. Added 1c chopped red bell pepper, 1c frozen peas, 1c sliced green onions to the 1c chopped celery. For the dressing I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 nonfat plain yogurt, juice and zest from 2 lemons, 1t lemon pepper, and doubled the dill. Stirred in a little skim milk to thin it out a touch.

A yummy, light-tasting, refreshing summer dish!  Instead of celery (I didn't have any) I used chopped green onions which added alot of flavor and I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper and a touch of garlic.  I also used whole milk instead of buttermilk.  I would definately make this again, it's a hit!

I love this recipe.  I made it for a potluck at work and I definitely had a few requests for the recipe.  Rather than cooking the chicken, I bought a roaster chicken from the grocery store (the pre-cooked ones?) and just pulled the meat off of that. Oh, and that was with scalling the recipe WAY down! lol

MmmmMmmm Good!!  I couldn't find lemon penne so I just added lemon zest to make up for it.  I also added a bit of green bell pepper & green onion (just personal taste)  We all just loved it.  Thank-you.

Good stuff.  Substituted lots of fresh dill and supplemented with a little feta and kalamata olives for a little more zest.

Good and a snap to make. I scaled to 4 servings, and used regular ziti, with the juice of 1 lemon, and the zest of 2 lemons. I really increased the dill for flavor. Will make again!

Very refreshing!  Great taste and you can use macaroni pasta too.  My 2 year old LOVED it and ate left overs for days.  I scaled down the recipe for 5 servings and it still made a lot.

Found this looking up what to make with chicken and dill, it's a warm night something fresh like this was perfect! I didn't follow directions exactly, but most reviewers didn't, ok so I cooked chicken with a little bit of OJ and a bunch of lemon pepper, added lemon pepper to the water of the pasta, (spiral cause I'm out of Penne) the sauce I just eyed the mayo in a bowl and added a few sprigs of chopped fresh dill (from my garden;) and the juice from one lemon (also from my yard;) I forgot the buttermilk,  added a can of artichoke hearts. It as really good. my husband loved it, and my daughter liked it but not the artichoke hearts. I am reallyt please with myself i am no chef but this was easy, fresh and sooo good. Oh we ate it warm but i'm sure it would be good cold too.

Took this salad to a potluck and it's pretty good! Made some modifications that I think added to the flavor. Roasted the chicken simply seasoned with olive oil, salt, peper & lemon pepper--easy and delicious. Did not have buttermilk (wish I did) but used milk and a splash of white wine vinegar & added 2 diced green onions. Made it the day we ate it and was not dry at all.

Not a fan of chicken salad, but this was delicious!  We raise our own chickens and I'm always looking for new ideas - this was a winner.

This was sooooo good.  The only thing I added was broccoli florets .  My husband said this was one of the best dishes I have ever made.  I couldn't find lemon penne pasta at my local grocery store so I added lemon juice to the pasta while it was cooking and just a little extra lemon to the recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk.  It was still delicious.

I made this salad to use up some chicken I had, but since I couldn't find lemon penne I just used some radiatore pasta that I had on hand.  When I went to take a photo, I realized that everything was white, so I added some chives and tomato to the plate to make it more interesting.  I do think that adding something with color to the pasta is an important step, so think about that when you are mixing this up.  Salt and pepper are necessary additions as well.  I am sure that the little girls in my life will love this!   Thanks for the recipe, Cobra!

I thought this was good, but the people I served it to asked if it was tuna vs chicken due to the mayo, dill, and lemon taste that it gave to the chicken.
