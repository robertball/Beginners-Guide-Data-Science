I was looking for an eggplant recipe that didn't contain gobs of cheese. This was very delicious! Thanks for sharing.

excellent salad and very healthy, I added fresh cut up roma tomatoes at the end when I tossed everything together, my hubby and 4 yr old son loved it too...I served with seasoned chicken breast, definitely will make again!  Thanks

iâ€™m sorry this may be biased. but the ratio from eggplant to other vegetables was kind of outrageous. neither of us really care for eggplant, apparently, but we will admit the dressing was pretty fire. maybe put three carrots in? (and my roommate says two bell peppers but tastebuds can only handle 1) also maybe jst more veggies in general
