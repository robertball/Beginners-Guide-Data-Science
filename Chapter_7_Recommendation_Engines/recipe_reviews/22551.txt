If I could give this recipe SIX stars, I would! I have made this over and over again - it's my family's ALL-TIME FAVORITE! If I'm making cookies for neighbors, friends, or get-togethers, this is the recipe I make. I go a little further, though - I double the recipe and also add a bag of white chocolate chips. If I don't have time to bake all of the batter, I freeze it, and it's ready for next time. This is the best cookie recipe ever! Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe!  The five stars are for taste and time in the kitchen.  These cookies bake up higher than they do wider so you can fit about 2 1/4 dozen on a 12X15 cookie sheet.  Quick to make, easy to bake, the dough need some hand help in the end once the toffee bits are added.  A BIG hit with the snickerdoodle lovers at the office!

Toffee makes these snickerdoodles amazing.. plus it's one of the few snickerdoodle recipes that stayed soft after a day!  Highly recommended.

Surprisingly, this is a cookie that tastes better after cooled rather than fresh out of the oven. I think the toffee bits had melted in the oven, but after they're cooled, they caramelize again and it really does kick this cookie up a notch! I added some cinnamon to the batter and flattened the individual dough balls b/c I find that cookies with shortening tend to keep shape and not flatten on their own.

This recipe is wonderful. I made it for a Thanksgiving snack and everyone in the family LOVED it.  This recipe was very easy to follow and it turned out perfectly.   The toffee definitely did add a wonderful taste to the usual snickerdoodle.

I didn't use the shortening I used 2 sticks of butter instead. I also used 2 cups of oatmeal and only 1 3/4 cups of flour.  They tasted AWESOME!!!

I first tried these cookies around Thanksgiving and since then have made them four times.  We absolutely LUV them.  If you enjoy snickerdoodles, I highly recommend you KICK IT UP a notch and try these.  Big Hit at our home!!  One more thing, I stored mind in a Gladware container with the lid loose.

this was great- I left out the toffee because I wanted a plain Snickerdoodle and I liked that this had both butter and shortening

Parchment paper is a must for these cookies! The toffee melts and sort of blobs out of these and sticks to the cookie sheet and makes getting them off a chore, and breaks the cookies all apart. That aside, these weren't too bad. Kind of a chewy, sweeter snickerdoodle than what you'd normally expect. Not too bad, not incredibly special though.

This is one of the best cookie recipes i have ever tried. I followed it exactly, baking until the edges turned just slightly golden brown, and they turned out PERFECT. I had to make them twice in 2 days because my roomates and I ate them all so fast! AMAZING!!!

I made these several months ago when I was searching for recipes with toffee.  They were good, but I'm not sure I would make again.  I don't think I was in love with the cinammon-suger/ toffee combination.

These were *okay*, but nothing more.  I bought two bags of toffee chips when I went shopping for this recipe and I'm going to look for another use for the second bag.
