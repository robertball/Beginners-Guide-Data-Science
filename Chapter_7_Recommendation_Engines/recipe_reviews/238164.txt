Great, great recipe. It's something everyone can adjust to taste, but the ingredients listed are the perfect go to amounts.

Delicious! I really thought I'd miss the tomatoes that are usually added to guac., but I did not at all. Great combo of flavors, that can be adjusted to taste, as needed, and I liked the spicy background of the jalapeno. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Iâ€™ve tried a ton of other guacamole recipes, however this one is the absolute easiest and is very good. I tried it with and without cilantro - I have to have cilantro - and it was excellent both ways.

It was a good guacamole , but I am one that just cannot leave a recipe as it is. For my family I added sliced black olives and 2 Tbsp of medium salsa to it, I also cut the mayonnaise amount in half. It was a big hit.  I plan to make it my go to recipe for Guacamole.

This tasted pretty good. The texture and color is spot on. I used a potato masher. Only change was leaving out the jalepenos, as I never tasted heat from theirs. Something seemed to be missing. I wasnt sure. I added a little extra squeeze of lime juice. The more it sits, the more the flavors meld. I made 1/2 recipe and it does make a good sized bowl. I would make this again for a bean burrito.
