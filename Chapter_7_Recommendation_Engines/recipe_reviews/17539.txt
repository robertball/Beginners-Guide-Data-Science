TO SUM UP ALL THE REVIEWS:    YOU MUST do these changes and you will have PERFECT results!  Add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to heavy cream before whipping.  CHILL the bowl and mixers you will use to whip the heavy whipping cream for atleast one hour in the freezer. After baking the cake and letting sit for 10 minutes to cool immediately wrap cake tightly in plastic wrap(a very successful wedding cake baker gave me this tip) It will make the cake SUPER moist! After wrapping the cake put in fridge until completely cool or if you have time let cake sit out until completely cool. You must follow the recipe and cool everything for its specified times or mousse will end up runny. Fold in mousse like stated!  VERY important!  Do NOT stir!  Fold and fold until completely incorporated. ALSO, change the amount of water you add to chocolate mixture to 1/3 cup.    I used two dark 9in pans for the cake.  I cooked my cake for 30 minutes at 325deg.   The mousse is so unbelievably decadent and delicious!   My cake turned out PERFECT! VERY best cake recipe out there! I did use a yellow cake mix b/c I feared chocolate may be a bit over the top(and im a chocoholic!) im glad I did, the mousse is SO rich! Hope this helps!

This has got to be the best cake I have ever tasted.  Hard to believe it started with a box.  I used the "butter recipe" box mix that uses a stick of butter.  I made mine as a torte with 6 layers and it turned out great.  A lot of reviewers had mentioned trouble when they went to take the cake to work or such.  So here are a few little catering tricks I use when I need to transport delicate cakes like this one.   If you don't want your icing to slide on the layers, add a 1/4 teaspoon cream of tarter to the heavy cream before you whip it up.  It will stablize the whip cream somewhat, just as it does for egg whites.  Be sure to whip until you get stiff peaks.  Also, after you put the mousse between the layers, chill the cake for about 30-45 minutes and then frost the rest and return it to chill until you need to transport it.  With the extra time in the fridge, the mousse between the layers has time to set up and settle in to the cake.

Just made this cake for the second time in as many weeks.  I'm a great cook...not such a great baker, but this recipe let's me pretend I am.  Wonderful, moist recipe and definately better if combined and let to sit overnight.  I also used only 1/4 cup of water and used Fudge chocolate cake and fudge chocolate pudding.  I thought that it was perfect! For those of you the have the problem with the runny mousse.  Please heed previous advice about cold cream and beating it until very stiff.  Also, just in case you don't know.  You must'nt beat the cream into the chocolate as it deflates the whipped air.  What you need to do is gently fold  about 1/3 of whipped cream into the chocolate and fold over until white stripes are gone and then add more whipped cream.  Continue until all whipped cream is folded into chocolate.  STOP when there is no more white streaks showing.  Refrigerate immediately and you should have a wonderful mousse.

This was a wonderful recipe! I made this cake for a co-worker's b-day and used a yellow cake mix instead of chocolate, put strawberries between the layers as decoration and it turned out awesome! I even got several proposals of marriage from the guys I work with...LOL (already married though.) I read where a great many people had problems with the icing & I can't say I encountered any problems. The tip about reducing the water by 1/4 c came in handy, as well as the tip about the cream of tartar to stabilize the whipping cream.  I will say that having worked with whipping cream before it can be a little tricky, you have make sure it is whipped into stiff peaks or it will turn any recipe into a BIG MESS if you don't. Definitely do not make this recipe if you are in a hurry and I agree with making it the night/day before. One tip I have not seen that may help is to make sure you are using heavy whipping cream and it is very cold, do not take it out of the fridge unless it is to put it straight into the bowl to whip. It is also best to use a beater that has a whisk attachment, regular beaters do have the same effect sometimes. The most important tip I give to all my friends when working with whipping cream is to be sure to CHILL YOUR BOWL this can make a huge difference. Stainless is the best, I let my bowl sit in the freezer while I am preparing the cake mix. Once I am ready to whip the cream I add it to the chilled bowl and whip it to stiff peaks and then place it in the fridge

The mousse worked perfect for me, here's what I did: melted chocolate and added condensed milk and mix until JUST combined. Added water (at room temp.) and stired through, when ALMOST combined add pudding mix.  Refrigerate for 45 minutes.  While chilling beat cream until thick and heavy (just before it turns to butter - I mean REALLY thick) refrigerate cream to get very cold (use a ceramic or metal bowl to help it get as cold as possible). Add the cold cream to the cold pudding and mix well.  Refrigerate overnight covered with cling wrap(8 hours plus).  Bake what ever cake you like (chocolate sponge is my favourite)and top with the mousse.  Refrigerate again (for about 2-4 hours) and serve.  It does take a little pre-planning, but worth all the effort.

I love this cake so much that I made it three weeks in a row!  I used butter cake instead of chocolate for one version, just as good.  My only recommendation is the same as the other reviewers, use REALLY cold cream to whip.  Try putting a metal bowl in the freezer for about 10 minutes before adding and whipping cream.  Also, don't whip or stir in the cream to the chocolate mix, fold gently.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used Hersheys deep dark chocolate cake recipe from this site instead of a mix. The mousse I used to fill and frost the two layer cake. It was one of the most moist cakes ever. I even had extra mousse to use with each serving. wonderful!! Will make again and again! Thanks

Very rich cake! Co-workers RAVED about it! The mousse was thick, more like a frosting, but nevertheless, it was to die for! Thanks for the recipe!

This is simply fantabulous... I have made this 3 times so far, the 1st attempt was in Singapore, the mousse turned out fudgy, but still the taste is good.  The 2nd time, I made it in Melbourne (Winter) I cut the water back to 1/2 c and the result was perfect.  Just over the weekend, I made it again and it was simply the best.. Using Devil's Chocolate cake makes a difference too!  Best of all .. it's so easy to remember the ingredients.. Stephanie.. thank you.

This cake is wonderful - you can't imagine how many copies of this recipe I have given out!!  My only suggestion is that I often cut back to 1/3 cup of water in the mousse - I found that it helps hold the layers together better!!  Many thanks for my new favorite cake!!

This has become one of my signature cakes.  Made it for an MDA Bake Sale Fundraiser at work and it sold for $490.00  Breaking all records.  The person who won told me it was worth every bite of it.  The only problem is that when they ask for the recipe is embarrasing to tell them how simple it is to make.  I love this cake.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Really good!  I froze one layer and half the topping for a later date.  I served the remaining layer topped with the mousse tonight and got good reviews.  Will make again.
*Have made it 3x's since initial review, once in a 9x13 and twice as a Bundt...Everyone prefers the Bundt.  It doesn't matter if the mousse gets a bit soft on the Bundt because its not holding layers together.  Also, easy to cut and serve.  I think its better the second day because the 'grainyness' of the pudding mix in the mousse has dissolved completely.

Do yourself a favor and save this recipe!  I've been looking for something that would compare to a cake we enjoy from the Cheesecake Factory and this is it.  I was skeptical about starting with a boxed cake mix but this turned out so good.  I even forgot the final step of folding in the whipped cream and it was wonderful.  I used two 9" round cake pans and used a chocolate cake mix. Even after forgetting to add the whipped cream at the end, I had enough mouse to frost the layers of a 4 layer cake but ended up having to use a tub of icing. If you can find them, insert a couple of long cocktail toothpicks to keep the layers steady.  I added chopped chocolate chips to the sides for a finishing touch and received many compliments.  Its a keeper!

This cake was quite delicious and easy to assemble.  Be careful not to chill the mousse longer than the recommended 30 minutes.  I left it in the fridge for almost two hours and had a very hard time softening it enough to fold in the whipped cream.

This was a great recipe!! I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday and everyone devoured it!! I took others advice and made sure to place a couple skewers in the cake before transporting it which worked perfect to keep it from slipping. I also added a layer of whipped cream on top of the middle mousse layer and added shaved belgium chocolate to the top. Easy and incredible cake!

Mmmmmmmmmmmmm-I loved this mousse. I did chill the bowl and beaters; so the cream would beat up quick and stiff peaks. That is important. I folded 1/3 of the cream at a time into the chocolate mixture. This way it leaves no streaks. I chilled this for 20 minutes and than split the cake into 4 layers and filled and frosted. It made a wonderful 80th birthday cake.

this recipe was a waste of my time. the frosting was excellent tasting, but was so runny that i could barely keep it on the cake.  i would definitely make the frosting again to use as a dip for fruits or so.  all in all, i would rather just buy already made frosting and save me all that trouble.

The mousse/filling/icing is very good.  I had no problems with it like others I read.  However... everything I read is mentioning "great cake"... The recipe calls for a box of cake, so I don't think that's accurate.  I am making this again tonight with yellow cake and strawberries.

If I could give this more stars I would!  Wow!  I had no problems with my layers slipping.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and ended up with a very thick mousse that held everything together wonderfully. Not only did it taste great, but it was the most wonderful looking cake I've made so far!  Boyfriend said, "Oh my goodness wow!" about 20 times after his first bite.  I will be making this on many occasions.

This recipie was pretty good overall, but I was disappointed with the mousse.  I think that the same effect could have been achieved by folding cool whip into chocolate pudding.  I dont think I will take the time to make it again.

What a delight!  Lot's of chocolate flavor.  I used a devils food cake mix and made it with applesauce instead of any oil and it made a moist and delicious cake.  There was plenty of mousse to fill & frost the entire cake.  I used two drinking straws poked through the top of the cake to keep it from sliding when I put it back in the refrigerator.  I served it with a fresh fan-sliced strawberry and everyone loved it.
Hint: Be sure to use stifly whipped cream as the recipe calls for.

Loved this. The mousse is quite stiff so you can mound it high up on the cake. The cake is a box mix so nothing interesting there.  But the mousse, considering it has no eggs, would be a fabulous dessert on its own.  I would add an extra 1/2c of whipped cream (so 1 1/2 in total) just to make the mousse lighter if you were using it on its own.  some instant coffee in the water mixture would be awesome.

The taste was really delicious and everyone loved it.  However making everything was a big pain in the rear.  Did everything per recipe and review instructions.  When I put the chocolate mixture (w/o whipped cream) in the fridge for it's 1/2 hr and it came out like a rock.  I could not stir it, let alone fold in the whipped cream.  Ended up mixing it in the mixer.  Once I put it back in the fridge I was really wary of letting it sit for 8 hrs.  after 2 hrs i took a little bit out and tried spreading it on the cooled cake.  would not spread, way too thick and was pulling up cake with it.  Ended up putting in another cup of whipped cream.  By then I was able to frost the cake but it was still really difficult.  Next time I make this I will:  Start out with 1/3 cup water along with 2 cups whipped cream.  If it's still too thick I will add enough water to make it the original 1/2 cup.  add the cream to the chocolate mixture before putting it in the fridge.

Even though the mousse didn't set up very well, this cake was still delicious! I used vanilla pudding mix instead of choc, and it was SO yummy! I'm not sure what I did wrong, but i'm gonna read through all the other reviews and try this again soon.

Outstanding!! My 9 year old son asked for a chocolate mousse cake for his birthday and I will admit I was a bit worried it would be too complicated and not come out well, then I found this recipe. Soooo easy! I used a devils food cake mix and followed the recipe exactly. Do make sure you whip your cream until stiff peaks are formed and this cake is best served after setting up in the refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight. I also divided the cake layers in two so I would have a four layer cake. I think this helps with keeping the cake from sliding because the cake layers are lighter weight which helps keep the mousse from oozing out the sides of the cake. It also makes for a great looking slice of cake!  My son LOVED this cake and so did my husband! I will definitely be making this cake again, thanks!!

I made this cake twice so far - one with a box cake mix and one from scratch.  The cake from scratch tasted a lot better!  To cut down on the sweetness, I modified the mousse recipe.  I only used about 3/4 can of condensed milk, decreased the water to 1/4 cup, and increased the heavy cream to 2 cups instead of one.  I put the mixing bowl and beater in the freezer before I whipped the heavy cream and I mixed in the pudding with a wire whisk.  The cake did slide a little when I was frosting it, but I was too impatient to wait for the layers to set in the fridge before I frosted the outside of the cake.  I brought the cake to work and got lots of compliments.

Very delicious and rich cake. I add 2 tablespoons coffee flavour liqure each into both the cake and the mousse. That enhance the chocolate flavour and my friends went over it. 10 people finished a 10-inch cake after a big fancy dinner.

Everyone adored this mousse topping!! It really reminded me of those refridgerated McCain cake's frosting, so if you like that, you will adore this - it's even fluffier. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Excellent!  I followed the advice of so many others and cut back the water to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tarter to cream prior to whipping.  I made the cream the day before and chilled overnight.  Absolutely perfect!  Everyone raved about it, especially my husband who is a huge mousse fan!

Let's get real - It won't look like you bought it at a bakery.  Anyway, the mousse frosting was wonderful.  A tip about transportation is to stick toothpicks or chopsticks in the cake because the mousse is so slippery that my top layer slid halfway off during its car ride.

This cake is a chocoholic's dream!  I made this for my husband's birthday and we enjoyed it quite well.  It is very rich!  The only thing was that the mousse was not quite as thick as I had imagined and the top cake layer slid around a bit.  I think I should have whipped the cream a little longer.....otherwise this is delicious!

Easy to make for a party when you have lots of other things to make.  Doubled it and made it for a baby shower and it was delicious!  Everyone ate some and took some home and I freezed the remainder which my hubby and I ate a month later and it was still moist and delicious!

I made this cake for my dh 2 years ago and snce I made it for my father-in-law, and my neice 2 years in a row! This is a delicious cake! I do change a few things: I use "Chocolate fudge" flavored cake mix...and 6 TBL cocoa powder with 2 TBL oil (in place of the squares). I also buy Fudge frosting and put that on the top of the cake. This way I have extra mousse which I put in individual dessert cups for later!!! DELICIOUS!

The flavor is good but I think it could have set better.  I also realized that there's "instant pudding mix" and "cook and serve" (here in Beijing, I only found the latter and didn't realize there was a difference).  Needless to say, after realizing this 6 hours after setting the chocolate part in the fridge to "set" (pre-whipped cream), I ended up having to cook it.  If others made this mistake too, it probably wouldn't set very elegantly.

HELP? First, I couldn't find a 3.9 oz box of instant pudding. So I used one large box and one small box. The mousse didn't come out at all like it should've have, it was almost like glue. I really want to make this again, but don't know what to do about the right amount of pudding, could that have been the problem??

Good cake, although since I normally bake from scratch, I could definitely tell that it wasn't totally homemade.  I followed recipe with only the two most recommended changes (adding cream of tarter to the whipcream and reducing the water to 1/4 cup). The mousse turned out just fine. I used it for the filling, but folded in a bit more whipping cream for the frosting so it wasn't quite as rich. I enjoyed it, but I will probably look for a different recipe next time.

Tastes good, but the pudding mix left the filling with an unappealing gritty appearance.  Any suggestions for what could be used instead of the pudding?

this cake was EXCELLENT. i took the other comments and only used 1/2 cup of water, and used cream of tartar in the whiped cream. i also made the mousse a day ahead, to really give it some time to set. before serving i put the cake in the freezer for about 1 hour!! it was perfect and delicious!

This recipe was really good. When I put the cake in to bake I put the metal bowl and beaters in the freezer.  Also!  for those that had problems getting their whipping cream to whip, oil of any kind is diaster for cream, so before you put it in the freezer, add about a capful of vineger and a teaspoon of salt to the metal bowl and use a paper towel to wipe it all around the bowl, rinse it well, then put it in the freezer.  The cream of tartar is a must also, great stabilizer!  I had to stir a loooong time to get the powdered chocolate pudding and pie mix to mix well enough so that there wasn't any grit left.  I also put the cake in the fridge after it had baked and cooled, during all those "chill for 30 minutes/chill for an hour" steps and it really helped when you went to frost it.  Over all, it was a pretty easy cake to make, all the steps just make it seem difficult.  Give it a try!!

I first made this cake  for Valentine's Day last year and boy was it delicious! I have added a bit of instant espresso powder to the cake batter and the mousse to make it "mocha". If you really whip the cream till stiff peaks form you will have no problems with the mousse.

This cake is pretty good, but being the chocoholic that I am, the mousse didn't exactly satisfy my sweet tooth, it just wasn't sweet enough for my taste.  However my husband who is not a huge fan of sweets really liked it!

great recipe. i get raves whenever I make it. I have used a 1/2 a cup of coffee instead of water to make mousse and sometimes I;ve used coffee in place of water to the cake mix. I have also tried this recipe using lemon cake mix, lemon pudding or vanilla an added lemon to make a lemon mousse cake. Both are favorites with my freinds and family.

Made this as a filly in a pound cake, and the left over where awesome with fresh fruit.

I made a chocolate one and a white chocolate one. Do the white chocolate I just subsituted the bakers chocolate for white bakers chocolate and chocolate pudding for vanilla. I liked the white version better then the chocolate, but bother were awesome!

Made this for DD's 14th bday party, and we feasted on the leftovers for a couple of days. Delicious! I used the cake mix with the pudding inside to make it more dense, and the guests enjoyed watching me whip the cream (and tasting the results!). Keeper!

The mousse tasted great. I used 50 cal. Dr. Oetker mousse dessert and it turned out nice and light. However I reluctantly bought boxed choc. cake and it was too fluffy and wouldn't come out of my nonstick pans, I should have buttered and floured the pans I guess. So I remade chocolate cake from scratch and the texture and weight was much better. If you can, make the cake 2 days ahead so the flavor of the cocoa has time to absorb. The last piece I had definitly tasted the best!

For this recipe I chose to make a butter cake instead, not because chocolate didn't sound yummy but because the person I was making it for preferred a white cake. The mouse was incredibly easy to make and so much more delicious than I could have imagined. Make sure to let sit at least the hour after folding in the whipped cream in. I chilled mine for aproxmiatly two. I tasted it before and after and the time just made it even more rich and tasty. I would absolutely recommend this and I will deffinetly be making this again!!

This is by far the best and easiest chocolate mousse cake!  The only thing that I was not familiar with was how to make heavy cream whipped.  After some research, I put the bowl and beaters in freezer for 30 mins. prior, and then proceeded to add the heavy cream to the kitchen aid bowl and blend.  Thank you for sharing this yummy cake that my whole family loves!!

Not sure what all the fuss is about.  I followed the recipe exactly and it tastes like a plain chocolate cake with chocolate whipped cream.  Nothing special.  I baked it in two layers, frosted liberally and while it was very pretty in presentation, it lacked a lot in the taste department.

Easy easy easy.  I used Betty Crocker's Gluten Free Devil Cake Mix because my son has celiac disease and then made the mousse as instructed.  Came out perfectly.  Very simple and seems good.  Will find out what the rest of the eaters think when I serve it tomorrow for Christmas dessert.

LOVE this cake! I have made it several times.  Be sure to do as the other reviewers have suggested (1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar before whipping the whipping cream & place beaters and bowl in the freezer to keep the whipping cream cold during whipping).  Enjoy!

Phenomenal!  Instead of a layer cake (which I do not have good luck with)  I made a 9x13 cake and poked holes in it after cooling.  I then let the mousse ooze in to the holes and then spread a good portion over the top.  The result was fantastic!  Everyone loved it!  I did use only 1/4 cup of water instead of the 1/2.

I made the mousse part to go with another cake recipe from this site.  The frosting was really easy to put together.  I got lazy and opted to buy a container of cool whip instead and I think that affected the end result.  When I frosted it on the cake, it felt runny.  Maybe next time I'll try to whip up the heavy cream myself.  But overall, it was delicious!

I'm editing this review since I first made it many years ago. I made it again today and I wasn't as impressed as I was the first time.  My culinary skills have evolved and my tastes have matured since I made it so I have a different perspective.  Now I'd say this cake passes for decent.  Stack it against the Barefoot Contessa's chocolate cake recipe and this is downright pedestrian. I put the frosting mixtures into the freezer to hasten the chilling and that worked beautifully. It helped keep things stiff even with 1/2 cup water as the recipe calls for. Several people reviewing this recipe have said the butter cake mix from Duncin is the best. I disagree. I used a butter fudge cake and was disappointed. It was very dry. Oil etc makes a cake moist and this had none. Anyway -- it's a decent cake but don't try it on your foodie friends -- it won't impress them. It will make your non-foodie friends and average joes very happy. :)

This was my first time ever making a cake.  I made this for my boyfriends birthday, (he is a serious choc-o-holic) he loved it, I thought it was too rich to have more than a tiny piece, although I thought the mouse was awesome!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (make sure the cream is super cold) I also chilled the bowl and the beaters for good measure.  I thought this was time consuming, (with all the chilling) but super easy, will definately make again when I have the time!!

This cake was DELICIOUS! I made it as directed and it was easy and fun but time consuming. It does take a while for everything to chill. This is good cake to make on a "clean-up" day.

I have made this cake several times. It is always a hit. I have made it strictly by the recipe and made it by reducing the water to 1/4 cup, I like it better with less water. either way, an outstanding recipe and easy to do.

I made this in a bundt pan, decreased the water in the filling to 1/4 cup, and added 3 T Chambord to the melted chocolate. I split the cake, spread it with the filling, then put rasberries on top of the filling before putting the top of the cake back on. After frosting the cake, I pushed rasberries into the frosting, and sprinkled the cake with chocolate sprinkles.  My family raved about the cake (oh my gawd, this is better than sex, etc). The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because I am not fond of chocolate cake made from a mix.

I was looking for a new cake recipe for the holidays and I found it! I used the cake mix that was deep chocolate so yummy.This cake was the best so easy. I will definitely make this again and again, although I may take the advice of others and try decreasing the water to thicken the frosting. Thanks:)

This is the best, easiest recipe for chocolate mousse I have tried.  Since I wasn't making this cake for extreme chocolate lovers, I used yellow cake mix instead of chocolate.  It still turned out fantastic and wasn't quite as rich.

I made this cake with a mix from the store that contained chocholate chips in the cake, and oh my goodness!!!  This was a heavenly recipe - my husband is insistant on me making this every year for his birthday cake.  The frosting is wonderful.  We usually throw some cake away, not this one - it was ALL gone.

Unbelievably good!  I layered some crushed Oreos (without the cream filling) onto the mousse in the middle of the cake to give it a little crunch. I also grated a dark chocolate Hershey bar and sprinkled on top of the finished cake - it gave it a really cool texture.  I made this recipe for a friend's birthday.  Most of the people at the party are in the restaurant business, so I had a tough crowd to please.  They were so impressed with the cake!  It was DELICIOUS!  They didn't have a clue that I could cook, since I'm always eating THEIR food.

I made this cake on Valentine's Day, it was a huge hit, everyone loved it. I'm not a very good cook and it was such a simple recipe to follow that anyone could make it. I noticed how some people put that it wasn't sweet enough, try using one square of sweetened chocolate and one square of unsweetened chocolate thats what I did and it turned out simply wonderful. I will definitely make it again!

My family really enjoyed this cake.  It's smooth and light, and a nice change of pace. My daughter wants me to make the mousse again, to spoon into a bowl with whipped cream.  Next time, I will use the mousse as a filling, and frost the cake with regular chocolate frosting and serve the mousse on the side.

Honestly the best chocolate cake ever!! The frosting is yummy...just like real mousse.  I used two cake mixes in order to make a 3-layer cake for an office party and doubled the recipe for the frosting (fortunately kept the spare layer with the extra frosting at home) ...everyone loved it!!

I've made this recipe 3 times and everyone loved it. Once, I used a yellow box cake mix and the other 2 times I used Grandpop's Special Chocolate Cake recipe on here. It was a little sweet using the box mix.  Grandpop's cake is not as sweet as typical chocolate cake, I thought it complimented the mousse perfectly.

Made my own cake, but mousse was great. Have it 4 stars because it's not as airy as I'd hoped for. However, if you want an easy quick mousse without eggs, it's perfect! I should've read the review which says to add cream of tarter to cream, I'm sure that would've helped. Lastly I added a thin cream cheese filling layer, made sure it wasn't overly sweet to balance the mousse.

I've made this cake a few times & it has turned into a family favorite. Chilling the beaters & whipped cream bowl helps & I also add a little less than a 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to the whipping cream.  Raspberries are a nice complement to the chocolate & look nice. They need to be dry when putting them on the cake. I also like to pipe melted white chocolate onto wax paper lined cookie sheet spelling out Happy Birthday... It sets almost instantly in the freezer after a couple of minutes & you can just gently lift the words off & place them on the cake!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I followed the original recipe first time. It came out so silky smooth, chocolate was out if this weld rich! When I cut each layer in half I put the mousse between and ONG, just fantastic. I kept the cake chilled the whole time because of the shipping cream in the mousse .  I want to wellout one of the middle layers next time and put cherry pie filling in it. Oooh this will be gooood!

This is one of our favorite recipes. I make a double batch of mousse and then we eat it later. I use fat free condensed milk and sugar/fat free pudding mix and it turns out great. My family is addicted to chocolate so I make it TRIPLE chocolate by sprinkling a generous layer of mini-chocolate chips on each layer. I also refrigerate each part of the recipe until very well chilled and I've never had trouble with this being runny. I really think it is in the whipping cream layer and if you chill the bowl and beaters well before mixing it and then also making sure STIFF peaks form. The post-mixing refrigeration helps as well.

Used unsweetened cocoa powder (reconstituted according to pkg directions), which saved time and made it so we didn't really need to wait to add the whipped cream (since the mixture was already cool). Made this even quicker and easier, and it was delicious!

Amazingly good - raves all around. I made two changes (because I didn't have all the ingredients), but I don't think they changed the overall taste at all. The first change I made was to use 6T unsweetened cocoa powder and 2T vegetable oil to sub for the unsweetened chocolate squares. This was better because you didn't need to melt it first. The second was to sub 2C of pre-whipped cream in a can rather than whipping 1C of heavy cream myself. I added it 1C at a time to "lighten" the mix then to make the final mousse. It was so good I may just make that as a quick chocolate mousse and serve it in cups. 
Oh - and I leveled the tops of the layers before I stacked the cake. It didn't slide around at all on me and the kids loved the pieces I cut off :)

I thought this was pretty good. Frosting was fairly light but rich. Definitely best served very cold. I think it needed choc curls on the top or as suggested raspberries as it wasn't that pretty when I finished frosting it. One really has to love chocolate to appreciate this cake. I made it for my daughter's birthday and she seemed to like it. I think I'll try another recipe for frosting like this just to compare.

I made this recipe before,but this time was the second time and i tweaked it a little bit.I made it for easter,and it was a hit!I did everything what it says,except i made it in a 13x9 pan,and I cut it in half and did that to layer.I thought doing it in two round pans made the cake part to thick,and using one big pan seemed to make the layers more even.

I made it just like recipe, but, used Yellow Butter Cake. Decreased water to 1/3 cup and added 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar. to whipping cream before whipping, as others recommended. I baked in 3 8in. cake pans, and , when they cooled, I topped ea. layer with raspberry preserves before icing each layer with Mousse. Used remainder of Mousse to ice top and sides of cake. Refrigerated Cake til' next day. Yummy! What a rich and Wonderful dessert, easy to boot!! I will certainly use just the Mousse in stemmed glass ware with raspberries and whipped cream. Thank You.......

This was delicious!!  I made it for company this weekend and was of course concerned that everything especially the cake would not be fabulous.  I had nothing to worry about, this was so easy to make and the taste, oh-h-h is this smooth eating.  I decrease the water to 1/3 cup because it was very very humid this weekend, I also beat the whipped cream until very very stiff, almost before it turns to the butter stage.  It came out great and had no problem with my layers sliding.  There was not one crumb left and there was only 6 people.  They loved it.  Thanks Stephanie, this is truly a great recipe!

This was fabulous! I just made this for my mother's birthday and people raved! I did not have unsweetened chocolate squares so I substituted 3 tablespoons cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons oil. I also lowered the water to 1/3 of a cup per the other reviews. Otherwise I followed it to the letter and it was outstanding. Thanks for sharing.

The filling/frosting is delicious...my husband and I couldn't stop eating it. It does help in step#2 to stir in the pudding with a wire whisk to help dissolve the pudding so you don't have a gritty texture. I plan to make the filling as a chocolate mousse dessert alone next time.

the chocolate mousse was delicious! i couldn't stop licking the spoon, while my husband waited for the empty bowl...this is definitely a keeper.  i did follow some suggestions like cutting water down to 1/4 c., making sure that the bowl & mixer was cold prior to whipping the cream, and folding in 1/3 of the cream mixture at a time...i also added about over a tbls of powder sugar to the cream.  the end result was very rich---i cannot wait to make this chocolate mousse frosting with homemade chocolate cake :)

This is really a very good cake recipe!  I do not like frosting AT ALL (to the point of scraping it off the cake) and this mousse "frosting" is a great alternative -- it's rich and chocolatey without being too much.  I took some other peoples advice and used 1/3 C. water instead of 1/2 and made 2 square 1-layer cakes instead of 1 frosted layer (after reading the "sliding" issue, I thought this would be good -- plus I can take 1 cake to the dinner and keep 1 for our family!).  I would recommend this for any chocolate lover (and I can see so many possibilities for this using different flavored cakes -- amaretto, cinnamon, orange, etc.).  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this as my Mousse to go along with 'Aunt Joyce's Chocolate Cake".... lets just say sooo easy and sooo good! My mom had to make a cake for work a few days later and used this as icing. But with sweetened chocolate, and was still good.  Awesome recipe will def use again.  Thanks!

Great taste, very rich! So, I'm beating the chocolate mixture with the hand-hel mixer and suddenly there's an electrical burning smell and the beaters start to smoke. Needless to say, I finished mixing by hand. When it came time to add the cream, since I couldn't whip it, I just added an entire can of redi-whip and mixed it in. Surprisingly, it worked just fine. :)

For a slightly deeper chocolate taste, I did add one tablespoon of dry instant coffee to the water to add just a hint of mocha. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe!! I made it because a friend specifically asked for chocolate mousse cake and i didnt imagine it would be this good! I used leftover semi- sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and I made sure to keep beating the cream until it was stiff. I also mixed the condensed milk, pudding mix and chocolate well before i added the water so make sure to get it as smooth as possible. Otherwise i followed the recipe exactelly as written.. Yummy!

I should have used a better cake mix. I thought the mousse part was great. It wasn't too heavy where it broke the cake like mentioned in previous reviews. This is VERY rich and it takes a lot for me to say that because I have the biggest sweet tooth of all! I will surely make the mousse part again, but maybe put it on an angel food cake or something, but next time the cake will be made from scratch. I followed the recipe as it is written. Just be sure to grease your cake pans up so the cake doesn't stick!!

I made this for my son's 6th birthday and it was a hit with the family!  The creamy chocolate mousse frosting made a beautiful presentation.  A little sweet for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  Will definitely make again for another special occasion.

AWESOME!!!!  If I could give this recipe more stars I would.  It was delicious and so easy and my guest were raving.  I shared this with lots of people and the only two things I did differently was add 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar and used non-fat condensed milk.

Call me decadent, I added some mini-choco chips to the cake batter and used an extra half cup of cream for the mousse. Took the advise of chilling bowl and beaters, adding cream of tarter before whipping, leaving the mousse overnight, and chilling the cake before icing. Served with fresh raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. Yummy.

This was so delicious and so easy to make!  I made it the day before and it held up beautifully.  I sprinkled it with a little cocoa powder for decoration.  Chocolate shavings or would also be good, but neither would be necessary.  I made it for a family birthday and everyone raved about it.  Great job on the recipe!!

this is a great cake, esp the mousse part. However, it does take some time to make and would only make it on a speical occasion. i used the perfect choc cake recipe. It's not a good idea to take to a picnic because the mousse will melt.

Everything that other raters talked about happened to me.  The cream never peaked, the "mousse" was too thin, the top layer slipped, and all the mousse ran down the sides.   The end result tasted like chocolate pudding over cake.   Waaay too much effort for not so great results.

YUMMY! Served this to dinner guests for desert and it went over great! Had absolutely no problems with the mousse what so ever! Actually, the mousse tasted exactly like this cream my grandmother used to fill these cream puffs that she would bake for the holidays when I was a child. This cake tasted delicious and also brought back many wonderful memories!! thanx stephanie! :)

I decided to use the mousse as a filling for a chocolate roll cake. I was disappointed that the mousse did not stiffen more--it didn't hold up well when the cake was sliced. Also, it had more of a creamy, pudding-like consistency than the preferred light, airy, mousse-like texture. The mousse was also overly sweet for my taste.

I have not tried this cake yet...but i often make cakes for people at work... so this is one i tried to make for a co-worker. It sounded easy and delicious...let me tell you though...i will never try to make this again..this cake frustrated me more than you will ever know...the cream wouldnt form any still peaks...it went from cream to mush..so then i have to send my boyfriend to the store to get me some cool-whip..i thought that would be easier...now it is around 11:30, he comes back...i mix the cool whip in..i stick it in the fridge for about an hours..and it is like chocolate syrup...i never could get it thick enough to ice with. so i ditched that idea around 2:00 in the morning...mind you i have to be at work at 8:00, dressed and looking beautiful.. i had to go to walmart and get some stuff to make my trusty stand-by icing. im never making this cake again. i dont care what yall say about it being delicious.

I'll make it again though.

A big hit, those who tried the recipe and had problems with the frosting, seems to be a result of not whipping the "heavy" cream enough.  you should whip it till you get at least stiff peaks.  I did not cut back on the water, you can, the problem seems to be more with the cream thinning the pudding if under whipped.

Mmmmmm...this almost gets 5 stars for easiness.  You could use your own chocolate cake recipe if you have a good one, but the mousse will dress up any passable cake & make it wonderful.  The mousse could go on its own too, as it is very nice & a good texture.  Try topping with raspberries or bananas & chocolate sprinkles.  It DOES taste like a bakery's!  Note I chilled a long time & no problems with jiggling or breaking.

The cake turned out delicious.  We used Duncan Hines Swiss Chocolate cake mix and the cake turned out very moist.  The chocolate mousse  turned out creamy and delicious, but my boyfriend said it wasn't chocolate mousse that we made...it was frosting.  That was just his opinion though.  We also ended up with a lot of extra chocolate mousse that wouldn't fit on to the cake.  Overall the cake was very very good and one of the best we've had.

The icing was a bit runny.  I was expecting it to be a bit more fluffy.  Maybe adding more whipped cream would have helped.

I've made this twice now. Each time I found that it was best after about 3 days. The first time I took recommendations from the reviews and added cream of tartar, but I feel the mousse came out too stiff. It's a bit easier to get a thick layer that way, but I think I liked the recipe better without modification. I definitely recommend eating with fresh strawberry, and it's also good with banana and walnut.

This is a great recipe! Easy to do. I used two boxes to make a four layer cake, added cherries to the top and around the bottom.  The mousse is awesome, its sweet but not too sweet.

Just made this with the addition of a Gnache on  top and was amazing... I always mess up my GF's birthday so I decided to step up a notch or 2 by making a cake....

I followed the recipe as listed, but I added a tablespoon of spiced rum  and then I topped the whole thing with a ganache recipe that I also found on this site The only other alteration I think I'll make is to find a better recipe for the cake part, but this mousse recipe is great.

One small critique/question... where do you find 3.9oz packages of instant pudding. All my store had were 1.4 oz packages so I used two... are you sure you don't mean "39 Grams" cause thats about the same as 1.4 oz...

Made  a 2 layer, 1/2 sheet cake 1/2 chocolate, 1/2 vanilla cake (use 2 boxes of each mix), and 1 recipe of the mousse for the  filling.  Then I made a buttercream frosting and decorated it for my daughter's sorority.  My daughter said it was the best cake I have ever made!

Such good mousse!  I made the mousse and paired it up with the "White Almond Wedding Cake" recipe from this site for our wedding anniversary.  I could have eaten this mousse with a spoon!  I did follow some other recommendations and chilled my bowl in the fridge while I was making the cake, used 1/3 cup cold water and added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to the heavy whipping cream before I whipped it.  Will be making this again for sure.

There were a few changes we followed from the comment section: definitely add the cream of tartar to the heavy whipping cream, chill the bowl and mixer before you whip the cream and 1/3 cup of cold water and it turned out great!!  Thank you for the helpful changes !!

This is a delicious frosting. I heeded the advice of other reviewers and decreased the water to 1/4 c. I also added 1 tsp of whipped cream stabilizer and 2 T of powdered sugar to the cream. When I removed the chocolate mixture after 30 minutes in the fridge, it was very stiff. I stirred, but it didn't really loosen up. I tried folding it into the whipped cream, but it was just too stiff, so I ended up putting it in the mixer. It turned out a nice spreadable consistency. It would have been plenty for a 9x13 or a 2-layer cake, but I had a four layer cake. I managed to make it work, but the layers between were too thin. I should have filled it with something else or made more frosting. Regardless, the cake will be delicious. I pressed toffee bits around the edge of the cake for garnish. It's in the fridge now ready to enjoy!

I made this as our wedding cake and it was wonderful. Everyone loved it, and people could not believe that I made it. Since the wedding, I have had many requests for me to make it again.  I did make slight modifications as others have mentioned such as reducing the amt of cold water to 1/4-1/3 c.  I also added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to the whipping cream before whipping and I chilled the bowl and whisk in the freezer before whipping.

This was a great recipe! I made this for the triple chocolate cake I made for my husband's birthday (he likes chocolate). Whilst it did take some time and you MUST refrigerate it before mixing in the cream, this makes an awesome frosting. This was in the top 3 of my husband's favorite frostings I've made for him. Definitely recommend!

OMGOSH!!!!! So good! I did do 2 cups of heavy cream after trying it with the one. What a difference! The only problem was there was so much frosting the cake shifted after slicing. Easy fix. Less frosting!

I make this cake every year for my husband's birthday. He loves it. I have never had any problems. (knock on wood) I do freeze my bowl and beaters before whipping. I was wondering about using vanilla pudding? To tone down the chocolate. Might not be chocolaty enough? Glad I found this recipe.

This is our go to birthday dessert.  I like to make 3 or 4 layers for my cake as I find there is lots of mousse. I also cut the water down to 1/3 cup to make thicker mousse.  You can easily use scratch chocolate cake instead of box if you like.  I like to use Suzanne's chocolate cake recipe I found online..  Enjoy.

Very good cake. I suppose this isn't necessarily a BAD thing, but the cake was so moist it was almost falling a part. Besides that, it tasted amazing and the mouse was to die for.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was a big hit.  The frosting is unbelievable.  I did add orange zest and triple sec to the cake because I like the flavor combination.  I will be making this again & again and trying different flavor combinations.  Perhaps coffee will be next.

This cake is simply DELICIOUS!!! It is so moist and the chocolate mouse frosting came out to the perfect consistency. I put my own little spin on it by dividing the cake into 7  1/2inch layers so that there is chocolate mouse in every bite. It also helped make the cake a little more moist...I am making this cake for turkey day this year it is so good :)

I made the mousse filling (with yellow cake) for a Mickey Mouse shaped cake for my nephew's 2nd birthday! Everyone loved the cake, but everyone agreed the mousse really made the cake. My nephew ate two pieces and asked for more! (Mom said he'd had enough...booo) My other family members requested I make this cake for their upcoming birthdays, different shapes of course. :)

Very tasty and easy to make, although it is somewhat time consuming because of the refrigeration time for the filling. It is not a very pretty cake, so plan to add some kind of decoration. Thanks!

This mousse was fabulous.  I didn't use a box mix, rather I used the recipe "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III".  The results were wonderful.  I did find the mousse a little difficult to spread, and in the future I may tweak this a little to modify the consistency.  The taste though is really fabulous.

This rating is for the mousse ONLY - The reason is that it was so delicious, it didn't need the cake! We tasted the mousse and LOVED it, so we decided to enjoy it on its own.  I may try putting it in mini graham cracker pie shells for something extra, but either way, it's fantastic!

Excellent recipe and really fairly simple. I love that it used a boxed mix, sure one can develop cake making into an art, but a mix is so much simpler. The mousse was simple and fantastic. I made this for a church dinner and got rave reviews and my kids and husband are begging for their chance to eat the whole cake and not share!

The mousse was DELICIOUS!  I followed the recommendations of others and added the cream of tartar to the whipping cream and definitely made sure that it whipped up to stiff peaks.  Took awhile, but I think it was worth it.  This was very rich cake, I used devil's food cake, good, but probably a little too rich for me to have again.

OMG!  Great Mousse!  I made this for my husband for father's day since he is such a Chocolate Mousse Cake fanatic.  Although, I took the advice about the cream of tarter & the 1/4 cup of water instead of the 1/2 cup, the top layer did slip off the bottom layer.  But I improvised!!  I put the cake in the freezer for about an hour and it kept its composure!  In fact, it tastes much better cold.  Thank you for helping me make my husband's father's day sweeter than ever.

this was really good however the  filling kept making the top layer slide...next time I think I am going to poke holes through the cake and pour the icing in it so saturates the cake.

I thought this was a really good cake - frosting really, since the cake is just a mix.  My husband thought it was very rich, and he was right, so you can't eat too much in one sitting.  However, the frosting was very easy to make.  I didn't have unsweetened baking squares, so I used baking cocoa instead.  The conversion is one 1oz square = 3 Tablespoons of baking cocoa + 1 Tablespoon oil.  It turned out really well!

This cake is awesome!  I get rave reviews every time I make it.  I bake the cake at 325 for 25 minutes and it comes out super moist.  The frosting is so light, yet so rich.  This cake is one of my favorites!

Really easy to make! The mousse takes a bit to make but it sure is heavenly!

If you're uncomfortable making cake from scratch, but feel like baking gourmet, try this!

It's a must-make and must-EAT!

Good cake, but the mousse was very heavy for the cake itself and made my cake split right down the middle of it from the weight of the mousse. It ended up spliting in three sections.  My advice is to not reduce the water, but keep it as is in the recipe as mine came out too heavy and thick. I made this for a co-worker's birthday cake and felt bad that I had to bring a split up broken down cake. Everybody said it was delicious anyways.  I'd make it again, but use a little more water.

Eh.  This was ok.  Not terrible, but I wasn't thrilled that this was what I brought with me to a dinner.  The mousse ended up being thicker than I thought it should be, if I made it again I would add a bit more water.  If you beat the cream until stiff peaks form, there is no need to cut down on the water.  I didn't love the flavor of the mousse I got so I'm not sure I will attempt this again.  I do have to say that it was better the second day having been in the fridge for more than 24 hours.  I ate a piece with some mint ice cream, and it was even better.

Cut down to half of the water, and added 1/4 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to the whipping cream, like others suggested. I used a box cake and it was DELICIOUS! OMG this is my new favorite. It was devoured by everyone...Not a crumb left. Like the saying goes...Try it, you'll like it!

I was looking for an eggless mousse to serve at a church luncheon and found this one.  It was perfect!  I made edible dark chocolate cups and used a piping bag to fill them with the mousse.  I followed the suggestion of whipping the cream very cold and very stiff and I didn't have a bit of trouble with runny mousse.  It was perfect....did I already say that?  I will definitely be making this again--perhaps with the cake this time!

Made for my mother's birthday.  Very light and fluffy frosting.  Liked it almost better by itself.  Kind of like a very rich pudding.  Think I will stick to the traditional buttercream but this was a nice change.  Will think of some other uses for it too.

I cannot say enough good things about this cake.  I used the Deep Dark Chocolate Cake from this site and it could not have been better.  I scaled back the water to 1/4C. as many people suggested.  The leftover mousse has been in my fridge for 2 days and it is starting to get slightly gelatinous/gummy, but on the cake it still tastes great.

I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 layer cake for a birthday party. I used just about all the tips & tricks and it came out so good. People are still talking about it. Definitely follow the advice that says to refridgerate the bottom layer after you frost it.

This recipe is wonderful! I served it to guests and they thought it was the best chocolate cake they have ever had! Instead of baking two cakes I did just one and frosted it with the mousse. It turn out fabulous! Thanks for the recipe Stephanie!!

This cake was fantastic!  I made this for a bridal party and everyone loved it!  Definitely a winner!  The only thing I would do differently is to add some gelatin to firm up the mousse a little, to make it better for frosting the outside of the cake.  Just a little though.  It is almost perfect already!  Sit back and enjoy this one!

This was great and so delicious.  I made it for my mom for Mother's Day.  It tasted so extra-super good.  (Another reason I loved this recipe was because I got to whip cream.  I've never did that before and it was always seemed like so much fun.)  I don't have anything else to say because I didn't have any problems with it or anything.  (Just make sure you don't make chocolate shavings from the chocolate you used to make the mousse((it's unsweetened))  I almost did that but remembered.)

FABULOUS!!  I made this for a co-workers birthday & everyone raved over it.  It was easy & the "Ready In" time of 2 hr 30 min is about right.  It was amazingly delicious for such an easy recipe.  A KEEPER.

One word: DELICIOUS. The mousse is very chocolatey and smooth. When my sister and I taste-tested the mousse, I remember saying, "we should not be able to make something this good". Simple can be good, and this recipe is super-easy.

This turned out beautifully.  I also did not have any problems with the cake sliding around.  After I spread the mouse on the cake, I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight...ummmm.  Really good.  I think I am going to try this mousse on the Dark Chocolate Cake (found also on this website).  Thanks

I have made this cake twice in one week and everyone loves it.  I made it for work they started to eat the cake at 8:00 in the morning and by 12:00 no more cake.  Both times that i did the cake i made them the night before and turned out great.

The mousse was easy and tasted great.  But  it isnt really mousse.  I used my own cake recipe instead of one out of a box and i put sliced strawberries in the middle and ontop.  Everyone loved it.  I didnt have anyproblems with the cake sliding around but the mousse did get gloopy on the sides and ran down it.  Otherwise it was good

Scrumptious! I took the advice and used a bit less water and it was perfect! The mousse was like velvet and just rich enough to take care of that chocolate fix we need on occasion. This will be made over and over for sure. Oh, by the way.....this is MUCH better than store bought. Thanks for sharing.

If you weren't diabetic before you ate this cake, you will be by the time you finish your piece. Although it is extremely simple (which is ALWAYS appreciated), the mousse does come out more like a frosting. For all the trouble you go through, you might as well buy the stuff from the can, since it's almost the same consistency. I added some milk and extra whipped cream to balance the sweetness out.

The only issue I had with this cake was that the mousse did not firm up as much as I had hoped.  Next time I will probably use just a little less water.  As for the taste...it was delicious.  I took it to work and got many rave reviews!  A co-worker just asked me today if I would make it again for them!

This cake was great. If anyone has any problems with the stiffness of the mousse, try adding a packet of Whip It when whipping the cream to stiff peaks. I added crushed nuts to the side of the cake. Served for Mothers day dessert, it was a hit!!!

This was pretty good, the mousse tasted better than I expected, since it was a fake mousse.  It was a bit mushy and I did whip the cream to stiff peaks.  My husband liked it, but I thought it was a little too bland, but worth trying.  UPDATE---- STOP THE PRESSES!!!  I TRIED THIS THE NEXT DAY AND IT WAS PERFECT.  FIRM, MOIST, AND NICELY FLAVORED. FIVE STARS!!  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!

If you follow the recipe as it is written there is no need to change amounts of any ingredients used.  The consistency of the mousse is good for frosting the cake.

I love this cake, it was pretty simple and tasted great.
For all the people having problems with the top layer sliding, try putting a layer of strawberries in between. It tastes really good and gives the cake some traction so it wont slide.

This recipe was the best! It was fairly easy to make, and the results were spectacular! The mousse was easy to spread, and gave a very professional looking icing on the cake. I used Duncan Hines Devil's Food as the cake, and it was perfect. I will make this cake over and over again!

Fabulous cake recipe.  The mousse is so delicious!  This cake is wonderful because it is chocolately enough but not overly sweet.  I added chocolate shavings on the top of it and it did look like a high end bakery quality cake.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will be using it again and again!

I made this for a family THanksgiving dinner; everyone's eyes lit up when they saw this pretty cake being unveiled and there were more takers for this cake than for all the other desserts put together.  It's a wonderful chocolate cake!
