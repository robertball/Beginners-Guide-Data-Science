I gave it 5 stars because the combination of spices is the best I have tried (and I have tried a lot!). I recommend to simply mix the dry and add the beer to desired consistency. I (also) found the pepper and lemon very overpowering so I halved the lemon pepper cayenne and black peppers and eliminated the lemon juice. This gives wonderful flavored batter but still allows the meat to remain the central focus. I used this modification on alligator bites in our concession trailer with lots of compliments.

We halved the recipe because we had only 1.5 lbs of fish to cook. After halving the recipe we toned down the lemon pepper cayenne pepper and skipped the black pepper (because lemon pepper has black pepper in it already). It still had great flavor and a little kick to it. The cumin adds a fantastic flavor. Also ended up adding the beer until the batter had a nice consistency so we used less than the recipe called for. Turned out delicious--very golden brown and crispy.

Loved the crispy flakiness of this batter. Adjusted seasoning and spices to my husband's taste. Also added beer only until desired consistency which was less than recipe. Cumin was quite overpowering in smell and taste test so added 1/2 tsp Kosher salt.

This was really good! The spice level was perfect (although I omitted the lemon pepper because I didn t have any) and it fried up really crispy! I did what others suggested and mixed up the dry ingredients first then added beer and lemon juice until the right consistency which for me was about 1.5 bottles. Great recipe!

Amazing. I just skipped the cumin, lemon pepper and lemon juice and used a little less pepper. I love lemon but since i add lemon while i eat no need for lemon juice.
