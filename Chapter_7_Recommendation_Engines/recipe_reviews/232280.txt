Quick, easy, tasty. I had always eaten winter squash by scooping the cooked flesh out of the rind, so I was confused about how one would eat this. If anybody else is wondering: You can eat these slices skin and all. Once you scrape out the seeds, you eat everything that goes into the oven.

I don't write a lot of reviews and I have been on allrecipes for years. However, I HAD to rate this because my husband hates squash but he absolutely loved this! At one point he even said he couldn't believe he was actually eating squash!

I followed the recipe as stated, except I don't own a jelly-roll pan, so I baked them on a cookie sheet lined (shiny side up) with heavy duty tin-foil and sprayed a generous amount of PAM cooking spray. (Emphasis on the "PAM" because I have found that off brand doesn't work as well for me.)  

I also didn't have any fresh thyme. So I just used a tsp or two of dried. The amount of salt, pepper, and parm was perfect. 

Baked 15 minutes on one side, flipped them over and baked them another 15 minutes. SO delicious.

Only one criticism...if sliced into 3/4" slices and baked for the length of time directed (I did 25 minutes) this was too long.  I think 20 minutes would have been perfect.  Other than that it was delicious, the peel slipped off easily, it was visually appealing, and a welcome departure from "sweet  squash."  The Parmesan and thyme were additions I've not tried before on squash and I loved them both.  I will try this again with exactly the same preparation,  reducing the time in the oven and as soon as I can persuade Hubs to grin and bear it again (he does NOT like acorn squash - no fault of the squash or this recipe).

Someone else said it "Great alternative to the butter and brown sugar acorn squash" Healthier too I'm sure. Only  things I changed wa to double coating ingredients used italian seasonings instead of just thyme.
I also  cut the squash across into 3/4" slices, for  more  eye appeal. Looked like flowers.

This is as good as acorn squash gets.  I used asiago as that is what I had on hand.  It did not take near 30 minutes to get soft but then I think I sliced my squash thinner.  I was worried about it because it looked like the cheese burned but it added a nice crunch to the tender squash.  I have never had acorn squash that wasn't sweet, I'm not a sweets person...so I'm ecstatic to have found this recipe.  Who knew the skin was edible!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Both my husband and I decided this is probably the only way we want acorn squash.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious.

I found that the Parmesan sticks better if you coat the squash in all ingredients except the squash and then roll it through the parm like breadcrumbs. Toally agree with the other reviewers - made 1.5 of the dressing. PERFECT squash recipe - thank you!

Very tasty, a nice change from most recipes that use brown sugar.  I used Kraft Parmesan (the kind that is almost like powder), not the fancy grated kind, and it turned out perfectly. I only had to bake it for 23 minutes. I also rubbed the cheese/oil/spice mixture on the slices, as it didn't make a lot of "sauce" and it was easier to just rub it onto the squash than to "toss" it.  Next time I might make 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 times the sauce, as this just barely covered it.  But it was super yummy.

LOVED IT!!! This recipe changed the way I thought about squash. Up until now, my only experience had been with the old-school butter and brown sugar approach --- way too sickeningly sweet. This savoury recipe is utterly delicious and ultra-simple to make. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon or so of garlic powder. Take care not to over bake it as with squash, you really don't want it mushy!

I actually got my husband (who Hates squash!) to happily eat this. A Simple & Unique side dish. Also, a nice change from the usual "nutmeg/butter/maple syrup" routine.

I made this with a delicata and decreased it to 1/2 of a small squash. Very yummy as a side dish! I used ground thyme just because it was closer to the front of the spice cabinet. This recipe is already copied into my recipe book.

I followed the recipe exactly and no one in my family would eat it. Bland with an unpleasant sweetness and mushy/crunchy and chewy textures at the same time. I can't see what I did wrong.

My first time cooking acorn squash. I didn't want to try a sweet dish so opted for this more 'savory' recipe. My husband really liked it! I didn't have thyme and sprinkled a little Italian seasoning and I used a little feta cheese along with the parmesan.

Scrumptious!!  I had to force myself to slow down when eating it, to savor it and make it last!  The only adjustment(s) I made was, I found I had to add another 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, otherwise it was more like a paste almost to coat the squash.  I had no thyme, so did without, and honestly didn't miss it.  I have the other half for another meal or to puree for an awesome soup base!

Yummy!!  This is a terrific recipe and a great change from the "normal" way to bake acorn squash.  The next time I make it, I will be adding a small amount brown sugar and will be adding more parmesan cheese.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Very good! This is my first expierence w/ making/eating acorn squash (crazy, I know!), but I really enjoyed it. Hubby and the kids didn't really care for it, but that just means more for me, lol. I liked the flavors (I even used the thyme, (dried), which really is not my favorite, but I liked it on this), and it was really simple to make. I did peel my squash. I still prefer butternut squash, and I may try this recipe using that next time, but this was a nice change and one I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made exactly as described, but placed it in a 450 degree oven alongside a roasting chicken. Perfect at 20 minutes.

I coated the squash in the Parmesan after putting it in the olive oil and I used ground thyme, but I followed the recipe otherwise. It was the first time I ever made acorn squash and it was delicious! I wasn’t a fan of eating the peeling as other reviewers said you could do. I’m definitely making this again!

A perfect recipe!  Easy to prepare, simple list of ingredients, fast to cook and delicious.  I try to get healthier foods into my family and it isn't always easy, but these were a hit (even with the self-professed squash haters).  Crispy, golden, and a taste almost like fried potatoes, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

It's so hard to find a savory recipe for acorn squash, and this one was delicious! I substituted 1 Tb Italian seasoning for the thyme, and added some garlic powder. I think next time I will double the amount of coating, which cooked to a very nice crisp.

This was very easy and very tasty!  I'm always ready to try a new savory squash recipe!  I made a sheet pan meal out of this by adding some sweet Italian sausages.  Instead of plain thyme, I used a Tuscan seasoning blend.  Served with some microwave steamer Brussels sprouts.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

We probably didn't put enough cheese/spice on it, but that was really the most tasty part.  We really like spaghetti squash, but this was not a hit in our household.  It was unique, but next time we will return to the old favorite Acorn Squash with brown sugar.

Worked well.  I substituted Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb for the thyme and added 1/2 sweet yellow onion. Acorn squash if picked too early bakes up watery and stringy. Those that had watery maybe that was the problem. The acorn squash that I used was orange on the outside.

This was so yummy!  I didn't have a Rosemary sprig so I used dried powdered Rosemary.  I mixed all the dry ingredients together.  The oil helped the dry ingredients to stick to the squash.  It made a crispy crust on each piece.  Really good tasting.

Just tried this recipe.  Didn't have fresh thyme, so used dried version.   Loved it, saved it, and will make it the next time I buy acorn squash. Excellent!

I do not like squash, but I had an acorn squash I was asked to cook at a friend's home. Chose this recipe since it had good reviews (several people saying it didn't taste at all like squash). They were right! I will most definitely use this recipe if I need to prepare one again! The only things I might add next time is a little more olive oil and cheese.

I loved this, made exactly as described. My husband doesn’t like thyme, so he wasn’t crazy about it, but we both liked the crunchy Parmesan coating. Next time I may sub garlic for the thyme to see if that’s more to his liking.

first time I made this, and my family did like it.  Added extra oil to the mixture to help with the coating, and next time I won't add the salt since the parm cheese is already salty in taste.

WOW - loved it! Great change from the usual brown sugar/syrup squash (and healthier, I'm guessing). Will definitely make again. By mistake I sliced them thinner than 3/4 inch (more like 1/2 inch), but it came out beautifully; will probably do the same next time. Also, as others suggested, I used Italian seasoning because I didn't have any fresh thyme.

I made it! I love it! The only change I will make when I make it again, is to sprinkle the cheese on after the squash has had it's marinade bath.  I found that I lost some of the delicious cheese when combing everything beforehand.  Boy was this delicious.  I'm the person who prefers savory to sweet for all dinner dishes, and this was perfect.  Thank you for submitting it.

Loved it. A nice, easy, different way to prepare squash. I added a little cayenne pepper, which gave it the perfect complementary heat. Next time I will toss with the olive oil first, then add the cheese.

Wow!! I had no idea roasted squash could be this good. Hubby and I absolutely loved acorn squash cooked this way.

The idea is good, I needed to season it more. It was to bland. Garlic salt will make the dish.

Tasty. Of course, it’s hard to go wrong with anything that has cheese :)
My only disagreement is with the reviewer that encouraged the eating of the skin on the acorn squash. I tried. I really tried. Don’t get me wrong, summer squash, zucchini, potatoes, carrots... I eat it all; why bother peeling it! However, this skin was sharp and chewy. Eww.

My Boyfriend doesn't like squash but I do ;-) So I was making a roast veggie smorgasbord for us and decided to sneak this recipe in.
He DEVOURED nearly all the squash and couldn't stop exclaiming out loud how he hates squash and but couldn't stop eating THIS squash!


I substituted dry thyme (about a tablespoon?!)  for fresh thyme,  and did half KRAFT parm and half fresh finely-grated Romano, Cuz that's what I had in the fridge. 

At the very end,  I switched to broil, and basted the squash pieces with melted butter that had a sprinkle of minced garlic in it.

I hope you love this, too!

I just rated this recipe, but pressed done too soon. So here’s another review. This recipe is a four star the way it is. I made these changes to make it a 5 star recipe. I usually substitute 1/2 tsp garlic powder for the thyme, 1 tsp salt instead of 1/2 tsp. I put everything except the cut up squash and olive oil in a gallon zip loc bag, seal and shake up until well mixed. Then I add the squash pieces, seal and coat them. Then add oil; seal and shake up again. I cover my baking sheet with foil for easier clean up and bake as directed. These are extremely yummy to me. My husband won’t eat them because it’s not corn, canned green beans or potatoes.

I don’t think I’ll ever again make squash any other way - this is delicious.  I used fresh Parmesan but otherwise, no changes.

Made this  dish just as written and it was very tasty. Baked it a little longer at 425F and got a crispy crunchy bite of deliciousness in every mouthful.  We devoured every bit of it. 
I may have used a little extra olive oil and cheese to get a good coat on each piece, I just eyeballed it.  

Thank you for sharing this easy recipe.

This was my first introduction to acorn squash. So, with that in mind, I'm not certain if it's just that I don't like acorn squash. 
However, I will probably not make this again. If I do, I'll be using a different cheese than parmesan. It was totally inedible and I ended up throwing over half of it away. It was dry and kind of gross. 
On the other hand, my husband liked it enough to eat half of it by himself...
Also, neither of us liked the rind enough to eat that.

Yummy! A little greasy so I'll adjust the oil next time. I used 1/4 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp dried oregano. My husband loved it! Great alternative to sweet acorn squash reviews which I also love.

Holy acorn squash! This is so tasty! Easy to make. I didn’t change a thing except I used dried (bottled) thyme instead of fresh. 2 teaspoons as another reviewer recommended. It smelled fantastic when it was in the oven baking but eating it is what counts and boy it was gooood!

I was disappointed with this recipe but I think the problem may have been the squash.  I used an acorn squash, but it had been in my fridge a long time.  Definitely not spoiled, but not very flavorful.  I will try this again, with a little more salt and a fresher squash.  If it is still bland, I will have to rethink this recipe.  But it is definitely easy!

Pretty good recipe but not a fan of the roasted peel. It got tough while the squash was very soft and yummy. I'll definitely make this again but without the peel.

A great upgrade from my usual plain roasted acorn squash. I used a shake or two of dried thyme. Recommend using parchment on the baking sheet for easy cleanup.

Delicious! Used 1.5 times the coating ingredients. I used dried thyme instead of fresh (about a teaspoon for every 2 sprigs). First time we had acorn squash, and husband and I both loved it!  Will be making this again.

My vegetarian daughter really liked this, she enjoyed the salty cheese against the mild squash. Yummy, healthy, and easy??  A keeper!

I made this exactly as written.  It was OK but it needs more seasoning as it didn't have a lot of flavor. Will try again adding more seasoning

The first time I made it per the recipe.  The flavor was delicious but did not care for the skins.  The second time I peeled the squash and cut into cubes.  It was perfect.  My dinner guests loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

Trying to eat Keto or just less sugar and this acorn squash is amazing! Used a generous amount of olive oil and baked for 15 minutes on Pam sprayed aluminum foil and then turned them. They were gorgeous! Baked another 8 minutes. Perfect! Will definitely make again! (I already have!)

I followed the recipe as written. Again, I would peel the squash as the skin was tough. I would also slice the squash a little thicker. I will make this again.

To be fair, we had squash that was picked this morning  so it was going to be good pretty much no matter what we did with it.  This recipe is a nice change from the sweet flavors usually associated with acorn squash.  I did not have thyme and used Italian seasoning as suggested by others.  I also added garlic powder since it  just goes with the other seasonings.  Was pleasantly surprised that the peel is edible since peeling the squash is more work.  Turning the pieces half way through cooking ensured consistent browning.  We most certainly will do this recipe again but I have to admit I kept thinking how good this would have been if made with potato wedges.

This recipe was so tasty and so easy!  I  made it exactly as stated and I will definitely make again.  I was a little skeptical that you could eat the skins of the squash as well, as I've never eaten acorn squash that way.  But it was delicious.

Delicious and simple recipe! I had a small acorn squash on hand so used only 1 tablespoon of oil, but kept the amount of parmesan cheese the same (because I love cheese...) with a pinch of salt and pepper. I substituted dried ground thyme for the stalks, about 1/2 tsp, since that's what I had. Turned out beautifully! Will definitely make again!

These came out great on the grill (using a grill pan). I could have held off on the parmesan cheese until closer to fully cooked but still were very good—although we took the outer peel off before eating. Will make again in the oven or on grill.

This is a big winner at my house. After cutting into slices I used a potato peeler to remove the skin before baking.  They were crispy and tender and the first thing to disappear!

This was great! The Parmesan on top had a wonderful flavor. I didn’t have any kind of thyme so I just left it out. Instead of mixing it in a bowl I put it all in a plastic bag, sealed it and tossed it that way.

I don't comment very often but my hubby asked me to make this for a 2nd time.  Great as it is.  Have fresh thyme from the market but a little low so added some dried oregano.  Great for lo carb diet too.  Yummy!

This is amazing!  Easy to make and delicious; my husband even liked it!  Eat immediately out of the oven, crisp and yummy.

Super fast and delicious.  Can't do lactose so I melted some butter and poured it on top instead of parmesan, but either way would be delicious.  So simple to make and sweet yet the thyme adds just enough savory flavor.  Will be making this again and again!

Excellent flavors. What a way to dress up a squash! I only added garlic powder. Will be in my portfolio.

I really liked this. The seasoning really highlighted the delicacy of the squash. Of course, it wasn't cloyingly sweet like the common holiday side dish.

Wonderful alternative to sweet squash!  I used half the oil to cut down on fat and calories. It was still delicious. Squash came out very tender and peeled easily. Will definitely make again.

I am not used to eating the fall sqaushes.  It was very tasty, had good texture, and easy to make. The 4 stars is because the flavor is new and I don't know what I think of it yet.

Coated in oil first the dredged is dry ingredient mix. Squash skin turned out crispy, flesh was seasoned perfectly and tasty. Definitely a great new side dish to serve again.

I didn't have thyme so I used dried Italian seasoning. I otherwise made it as directed. I baked these for 30 minutes, and they turned out perfect.

This was a great mix up on acorn squash. We ate the whole thing, rinds and all! The cheese is the best part, as you aren't expecting the saltiness from it when you take a bite.

Very easy , as long as you have a good knife.  Also  ingredients are flexible.  Didn't have fresh or even  dried thyme and while preparing I realized all I had was grated parmesan.  Never fear.  I used sage and the cheese worked fine.  It was yummy.  Next time I'll try the real recipe!

I thought I was going to love this but not at all.  The squash was too sweet by itself and didn't lend well to adding the savory herbs & cheese.  I use these herbs when making spaghetti squash and it is fabulous. Will not make this again as I actually threw the majority of the squash away.

Very good! I  used a Delectica squash and did cook it for 25 minutes and that was long enough. The best thing is to check occasionally for doneness. This is a new favorite!

This was awesome! I deleted the salt as we all have heart issues. I did not have any olive oil so I used 1 tablespoon canola oil that I soaked garlic in and 1 tablespoon of canola oil that I soaked onion in. I also used dried tyme. I cooked them on parchment paper for 30 minutes, flipped and cooked 10 more minutes. They were beautiful and golden and crispy on the outside and soft inside. Sooo good! We have always cooked acorn squash cut in half with butter and honey or cubed and cooked with a roast or stew. This was lovely and will be a new family favorite! M

I've never actually had acorn squash before and was surprised at how good these tasted. I bought the acorn squash to made homemade baby food and was looking for a recipe to use up the rest. I was not sure if I should keep the skin on or not so I peeled them after roasting them. This was very quick, easy and delicious!

Doubled the recipe, but used 1 acorn squash and one butternut. The butternut was edible, but the acorn was delicious! Was a little too greasy, though. Would reduce the amount of oil next time. Also, used dried herbs.

Good, but not bursting with flavor. Perhaps this was due to the fact that I did not have fresh thyme.

The texture of the meat was good but the skin was rather tough. If I make it again I will peel it. Also it seemed a bit bland. It needs to be spiced up.

Made this last night. Had some squash leftover from our garden. It was fantastic. Made it just as written. My husband had the leftovers for lunch. He loved it. Thanx for a "keeper" recipe!

This was quite tasty for something so simple to make. I didn't have fresh thyme, so used dried, but it still worked out just fine. It was nice to have a different winter squash.taste.

Very yummy.  The flavors blended together nicely, though it was a little mild.  I added garlic powder because I love garlic, and added a little more seasoning to add more flavor and it was very good.  The only down side, was they were a little dry.  This was the first time I have ever made acorn squash, so I just need to figure out how to make it a little moister.  But overall, very good and I will be making again.  A drizzle of EVOO right before serving helped with the dryness.

I love acorn squash.  Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great.  I do not like to sweeten versions of acorn squash so this was perfect.

04-20-16 ~ A recipe doesn't get much easier than this one. I didn't have fresh thyme, so I had to use dried. I really enjoyed this dish, but DH is not a fan of squash, so he ate one slice and told me to eat the rest. I served this along side 'Fiery Pork Skewers' from AR, a salad and leftover 'Blueberry Boy Bait' from AR.

It was good. I did not salt it and I should have. I know that parm is salty and I thought that would be enough, it needed a little extra.  We had pot roast and gravy with mash and carrots so there was a lot going on during the meal. I had people over and no one had ever eaten a acorn squash before. It was fun as everyone tried something new. Everyone liked it no complaints. One person said it's even better with gravy. I will make this again.

Wonderful. My husband doesn't usually love squash and kept eating this. In my 37 years of life so far I think I've been missing out with my old boring microwaved half squash with butter. Just keep buying squashes several weeks in a row now that I've found this recipe. Been eating with the skin too per another reviewer. Try it! ;)

I found this recipe in the allrecipes magazine.  The recipe called for 8 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme.  I made it with dried thyme and I feel that was way too much thyme.  My husband and I really enjoyed the squash this way, but when I make again I will cut the thyme to 1/4 tsp. Thyme or use Italian seasoning like some of the other reviews said.

The parmesan and thyme didn't compliment the squash flavors very well for us, and the skin was difficult to maneuver around.

Super easy and yummy.  I didn't have as much acorn squash as the recipe called for, so I just guestimated amounts of salt, pepper, oil, and thyme.  Skipped the parmasan cheese to save a couple of calories and it was yummy and delishe.  Would definitely make again.

This was really good and I will definitely make it again! I don't eat cheese so I used nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan, dried thyme instead of sprigs, and a little more olive oil than recipe calls for (the NY really soaked up the oil!). I put it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. It tastes great cold too :)

I also made some with basil ,  loved it too.   I did not bake the full time because I do not like mushy veggies.  i cut   squash into chunks and cooked approx 20 to 22 min.

I made this recipe without the salt and thyme. Used Romano instead of Parmesan. Added crushed red pepper and added about 1/2 cup of water to the cookie sheet I baked it on. I would suggest spraying some nonstick spray to the foil to keep from sticking. This was shockingly delicious and will make it again.

I have never, EVER, liked acorn squash.  In fact, since childhood I've turned my nose up at it and refused to touch it as memories of butter and sugar soaked squash ran through my head.  But I'm so glad I decided to give this recipe a try.  The savory twist on it is gold!!!  It was so delicious.  The only thing I did differently was add a garlic/Mediterranean spice blend to it.  I also used freshly shredded Parmesan.  I didn't want to stop eating it, I could've finished the whole squash by myself.  A must try, even for those who think they don't like acorn squash.  I'm a believer!

I didn't have any fresh thyme and forgot to sprinkle in dried.  It was great that way.  Even my squash hating husband said it was good.

This was very good.  It came out perfect and adds a twist to acorn squash.  We really like it.  We scooped the squash out of the rind.  We did't eat the skin.  A little butter and it was good to go.

Probably the best way to make roasted acorn squash!  This is a definite keeper.  Super easy to make to very little clean-up.

Wow this was really delicious and easy!  Used asagio cheese - and Pam olive oil spray to lower fat.  I was really impressed with how yummy this was. Cooked in 15 min. I will peel them next time - the skin tastes good but it's kinda tough and hard too chew.

This recipe needs additional cheese flavors other than just parmesan to give it a kick. I made it exactly as instructed and I think addings some panko breadcrumbs and additional complimentary cheese is what I would do if I make this recipe again.

Squash was dry and needed butter at the table, but otherwise very easy.  I pre-cooked the squash until still quite firm, then put the whole baking sheet in the refrigerator, put it back in the oven about 15 minutes before eating. I used Delicata the second time, and it really didn't work.  The squash took forever to cook when I followed the recipe more closely.  And I agree that it's easier to eat it skin and all.

This was just OK. Made it exactly as written, but mine turned out mushy and kind of bland - which DH hates - but I ate it as if it was a baked/mashed potato (put some chicken in gravy on top) and that was just OK. I think it must have been over cooked. Also - the skin was not great to eat, even though many said it was. Kind of tough compared to the soft, mushy interior..... :( Disappointed!

Awesome!.... similar texture to baked fries. No Parmesan but had some Feta crumbles. Used fresh parsley, a sprinkling of garlic powder, and a good bit of fresh ground black pepper for a spicy taste.

I followed the recipe and this was my first time eating and cooking acorn squash.  If I make this again I will peel the squash and probably mix it with sweet potato due to the sweetness of the squash.  I used the parmesan cheese but I didn't like the two taste together.

Yum.  I cheated though, I used butter instead of olive oil and added some garlic powder.  Until this year I have never eaten squash without the brown sugar and butter, etc., but decided to try some other versions.  I am finding I like squash a lot prepared other ways.  Will be making this one again.

This was simple and delicious!  I added a little garlic powder and some parsley for color.  The squash was sliced about 1 inch thick and cooked up almost like a roasted potato, nice and crispy with a creamy interior.  Excellent side veg we will have again.

Everyone in my house liked it and that is saying something! Very different to have a savory flavor instead of sweet. Nice option. I did sprinkle a little extra parmesan on top of slices once I put them on a cookie sheet. Skins were pretty soft, much like potato skins and tasted nice.

I subbed grated cheddar cheese and dried thyme because I didn't have the other. It turned out so good! My husband doesn't like squash at all and actually loved this too! It basically highlights the buttery flavor of acorn squash and downplays the sweet.. perfect for people who don't love super sweet squash.

The best way to eat squash. It was easy and delicious. I roasted for 20 minutes then flipped them and roasted another 15. They were perfect. The roasting time would probably depend on moisture content of the squash.

I made it per instructions, with the exception of ground thyme instead of fresh thyme. Guests who don't like squash loved it, and some folks had a second helping. I'm making it again for Sunday dinner.

I have found how to make them crispy!  My family LOVED these! So much flavor.  When I made them I lined my jelly roll pan  with parchment paper and cooked them for 30 min at 400 - but since my main dish wasn't ready yet I turned off the oven and left them in for another 10 min and they came out crispy!  Granted - a couple of the thinner slices were a little too crispy - but overall a huge success at our house!

So simple, so delicious!
I made this the other night for family and friends. We were having a BBQ so I needed a good veggie side dish, something different than corn on the cob. I could tell by the looks on peoples faces that they were hesitant to try it, as I live with some serious carnivores who are seemingly scared of vegetables... Anyway, it was a HUGE hit! Every piece was devoured and I have since been using this method for all my other squashes and garden veggies. A must try for picky veggie eaters.

Planted acorn squash in the garden and had no idea how to cook it. Most of the recipes I found were for a sweet recipe, so was happy to find this one and we LOVED it. Thank you!

I have always had acorn squash with brown sugar and butter and I was not sure how I would like a savory version.  I loved it!  I could have eaten it all myself.  delicious, my new favorite way to make acorn squash.  and a bonus is that it cooks more quickly in slices than in halves.

Made this last night and it was Delish! Husband (who doesn't always like squash) loved it also. I added a little Italian seasoning into the Parmesan cheese and to top it off I toasted the squash seeds and sprinkled them on before serving. Nice little added crunch!

Parmesan Roasted Acorn Squash Haiku: "Squashy 5-star good! Just the right squishy, squash taste. All of us loved it!" Gosh, how did one of the reviewers manage to cut her acorn squash in the direction for "flower" shaped slices?? Those things are a beast to cut more than once uncooked! I was happy to get my 3/4" thick slices at least, and left 2 of the slices "naked" to mash up for my baby, while the other slices I prepared as written, only I had to use bout 1/4 tsp. dried thyme as I didn't have fresh. But RIGHT ON, that thyme and parmesan really came together beautifully w/ the sweetness of the squash, and I do also love eating the skin!

I flipped at about 10 minutes ans added a little more cheese herb mixture to the tops and finished them off.
Next time I will peel the acorn before baking, we found that skin took away from the overall taste of the baked squash.

Excellent! I see a lot of sweet squash recipes, but this is a fabulous savory one (my preference over sweet). The only thing I did differently was to cut the squash up into about 3/4"-1" cubes…just a little easier and I think would be a little easier to eat. I didn't know that the skin could be eaten, so I left the skin on after seeding the squash. I'll definitely make this again!

This is superb!  I couldn't believe how delicious the sauce turned out. Now thinking of what else I could use it on. I used a cast iron deep skillet. Only roast 20 minutes and eat peel & all.

Five stars for teaching me this easy peasy method of cooking acorn squash, but only one star for taste.  I followed the quantities to a T and used my very best parm. reggiano and still the inherent sweetness of the squash overrode the parm. flavor.

I tried this recipe (substituting dried thyme for fresh) and thought it was wonderful the way it turned out.  Thank you for a great idea other than just baking the squash like I usually do.

We tried this with a mix of zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and green peppers and it was incredible!

My hubby is not keen on squash, nor parmesan. That's ok, I made this recipe for ME. It is marvelous and I will eat it all! I liked a non-sweet main dish for my dinner party, plenty of other folks tucked right into it...the husband wouldn't even try.

This recipe was wonderful!  I was looking for something to do with acorn squash that didn't involve adding sugar or anything sweet.  This was great as a side dish or to snack on.

This is a great way to prepare squash!  Everyone I have made it for has loved it.  It's also an inspired coating for other veggie.  Try it on potato wedges; you'll love it!
