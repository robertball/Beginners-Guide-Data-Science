This was a yummy recipe for using up leftover ham. I didn't have the "scrambled egg" effect that some reviewers complained of. Perhaps because after I combined the noodles, cheese, ham, etc., and put it into the casserole I let it cool off for about 15 minutes while I was doing other chores before adding the egg/milk. Nice combination of ingredients. We enjoyed.

I took the other reviewers' advice and subbed in a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the mushrooms to give htis better consistency, which worked really well.

I have tried other recipes using cream soups, but after trying this one, I find that it is the best yet!  The only change I made was to switch the swiss cheese with cheddar cheese, because I had that on hand.  Absolutely delicious and my hubby is a picky eater.  He loved it too!  Definately a keeper!

Using feedback from other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and decided to skip the egg/milk combination and used a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a cup of milk instead.  I also added a 1.5 cups of frozen peas (for color) and made it with a wonderful gruyere cheese - it was creamy, tasty and terrific.

Husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The egg/milk combo added a nice texture and variation on the traditional 'noodles with meat and cheese' casserole.  Made it exactly as the recipe directed and probably wouldn't change anything.

Made this today to eat during the Rose Bowl parade. This is a bit hard for me to rate. First of all, I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese (good move). I omitted the mushrooms. I should have omitted the salt. This recipe is VERY DRY! I had read the other reviews and knew that it was dry and added a little extra milk, but wow, it really is a dry recipe. I should have compensated more and added sour cream or something. I did have a bit of the scrambled egg effect that others described, but it wasn't bad. I used butter to saute the onions instead of oil. Thank you.

Enjoyed this recipe.  I added a tablespoon or two of butter to it and a tad extra milk then covered it to bake it.  Turned out very good ... much better than the overdone canned soup mix-ins!

I read the reviews and made a couple of changes - I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup milk and 1 egg for my casserole. (I increased the serving #, thus increasing all ingredients.) I also didn't have egg noodles on hand, so used elbow. The casserole was delicious and everyone liked it.

To those of you who change the recipe by using a cream canned soup, please just submit your recipe rather than tell us you changed it. Some people cannot cook without canned soups.

I have to admit I made a major change in the recipe.  I had some leftover rice pilaf, so I added 4 C of that to substitute for the noodles.  The pilaf had sauteed onions and garlic in it and was cooked in chicken broth. So I did not add extra onions.  Also, I added the parmesan to the mixture (and added maybe a little more, too).

Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.  We all liked it and did not find it bland at all.  I think I'll make it this way again.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's always good to find a new way to cook with ham.

Great recipe.  I did use fresh mushrooms - my favorite - along with fresh garlic and a little extra milk.  So nice to see a casserole recipe that DOESN'T use mushroom soup.  Tooooooo much salt in it!!  Not healthy.

A tasty dish, but don't toss the noodles in oil if you want the sauce to stick to the pasta.

This is a tasty, quick and satisfying dish!  I used regular pasta noodles, and I added some cream of mushroom soup on the advice of others, since hubby doesn't like chunks of mushrooms, it made it creamy.  I also didn't have swiss cheese, so I cut up Velveeta, it was soooo good.  Thanks for sharing!

This was ok.  I did use mushroom soup instead of mushrooms.  Other than that everything was left the same.  It wasn't bad, but I do not think we'll be making this again.  Sorry.

Received positive comments from my husband & step daughter!  I added peas, substituted spagehtti for egg noodles, & fresh mushrooms for canned (which I sauted w/ the onions).  I omitted the salt and doubled the pepper.  The ham I was using was salty enough.  Was filling and tasty.  Perfect on a cold evening when we got our first snow!

This is a keeper. Great way to use up last of the ham. Did add 1 c. frozen broccoli, fresh  mushrooms and some mozzarella cheese--DH kept nibbling on the Swiss. Used a little oil and some buttery substitute on noodles and sprayed PAM in the fry pan. Then ruined good intentions by adding a little heavy cream to the eggs and milk. Did cut down on salt too. I also put the lid on the casserole so it wouldn't be too crisp on top. Great flavor, nice consistency--not soupy.

This recipe is great. Instead of egg/milk mixture, I added 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom 10.5 ounce soup,reduced sodium version. I added 3/4 cup of whole milk to the soup mix. Added a small jar of already cooked mushrooms, added extra cup of swiss, and extra parm cheese on top, It came out creamy and wonderful. Will make again and again!!! FYI- omitt the salt, there is enough in the ham.

We love this recipe as is minus the mushrooms, but it is heavy on the oil, so I normally cut the oil in  half.

Very good recipe. I used whole wheat rotini extra grated swiss and parmesan cheeses, and @ 1 cup canned milk rather than the regular milk and eggs.

Very good after making a few adjustments!  The only ingredients I changed was I substituted half the swiss for sharp cheddar because my son isn't crazy about swiss, I used cream of mushroom in place of the mushrooms, and I added about a cup of sweet corn.  Also, I modified the directions slightly where I added the ham to the onions which I sauteed until they started to brown, and then I added the cream of mushroom to 'deglaze' the bottom of the pan and get all of those tasty brown bits.

Added an extra 1/4 cup of milk with a 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to make it creamier.  I actually skipped the ham, and had it as a side with some chicken.  And I only cooked it on 400 for fifteen minutes.  It was very good!

This was pretty good.  I did add some frozen peas to it before baking it.  I added a little less salt than it called for and I did add some garlic to the onions while they were cooking.  Overall a pretty quick and easy dish to throw together.

I made this exactly as written, except added frozen peas and carrots.  It's not bad, but it's not great either, kind of bland and very dry.  Should have paid more attention to the other reviews and added a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the egg mixture.  Or made it like a Tetrazzini, with a little white wine, cream and butter thickened with flour.  It needs a little work.

Very good.  I liked the egg/milk combo poured over the hot dish.  Frankly, it was a nice change from a cream soup and less processed.  I added kraut to the ham mixture, it was fantastic, added nice flavor.

This is delicious and easy.  I made 2 minor adjustments.  I didn't use the 2 Tbs. of oil.  The noodles were fine without it, I used 2 tsps. of butter to saute the onion.  Secondly, I mixed all the ingredients together, rather than pouring the mixture on top.

I added some sour cream; also some red/green chopped peppers, and also let the mix cool down before adding the egg and milk.  This isn't a bad base for something, but on its own...it's not very flavorful at all.  My husband said, "You don't have to make that again!"

Very disappointing but will give 1 star as that's the lowest rating.   Recipe as written is very bland, eggs seemed to curdle giving an unappetizing look.   Adding additional ingredients in my opinion is only trying to salvage the meal, better to start from scratch with a different recipe for leftover ham!   Already removed this recipe from my recipe box.

As others have posted, my rather picky boyfriend actually loved this recipe, had seconds, and even brought the left-overs to each for lunch at work! I will try it again with cheddar cheese, too. I also got the 'scrambled egg' effect, but neither of us seemed to notice or really care.

We will definitely be having this again, and I am going to add this to my repetoire! Thanks for posting such a good, easy recipe!

This was rather tasty and a good way to use up some noodles I had not to mention a very thrifty dish to make.  I used some julienned ham strips that I purchased at Aldi to prepare the dish with, but a it could really be a budget dish by using ham leftovers.  I added a little nutmeg for flavor...it was a nice touch.  It's the perfect dish for a cold, winter evening, not to mention quick and easy.

Okay... not too exciting... I left out the mushrooms because husband is allergic and I'm sure it would have been better with those, but it was still okay... I think I wasn't as enthused with this recipe because I really tasted the eggs and I'm not a big egg lover- especially in a dinner.  I probably won't make again.  I substituted fettucine noodles for the egg noodles and that worked out fine.  Could have used more cheese and then some more taste.  I wasn't crazy about it.

My husband and I enjoyed this casserole although the egg mixture did kind of turn into scrambled eggs when it baked.  I will make this again but will play with the egg mixture to try and get it a little smoother.  Maybe a white sauce would work well?  The flavor of the ham and swiss was delicious.  I made one change and used whole wheat egg noodles instead of regular.  I would recommend this recipe to others.

I used cheddar and fresh mushrooms. Added garlic too. Pretty tasteless and dry. I did not like the whole scrambled egg/sauce. Kind of just tasted like ham and eggs.

I used canned corn instead of mushrooms, and added cheddar along with the swiss. It was delicious and satisfying. A great way to use leftover ham.

This was excellent! I added cream of mushroom soup and left out the mushrooms. Next time I will also cut down on the salt, maybe to 1/2 teaspoon. I'm definitely adding this to my regular recipe rotation!

This came out dry and oily at the same time.  Next time I will saute the onions in less oil, and maybe try a different cheese.

That was a wonderful recipe.  My mom makes a similar one, but this one is much better.  The only change I made was that I used shredded italian cheese instead of swiss cheese because I had it on hand.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It tasts great with a mixed green salad on the side.

This was really a quick preparing dish.  I didn't have any green peppers or minced onions so I used a small white onion chopped.  I went with Amanda's idea and added 1/2 cup of water to the soup mix.  It just didn't look like it was going to be enough of it to add to the mixture. Now I did cook it in the crockpot but turned the heat up to high and it only took 4 hrs to cook.  Next time I'll add other veggies like carrots or even broccoli to it.  I think the type of ham you use also decides the saltiness.  Mine hardly had any salt in it and I think thats what made the difference on the flavor. Was very filling.

Just made this recipe (doubled) and it's a keeper (all of us to include hubby and 3 teenagers). I added fresh chopped garlic and used fresh baby bella mushrooms (10oz container). I saute'd the garlic, onion and mushrooms in butter. I completed omitted the salt because I add salt when cooking the pasta and because the leftover ham I was using up was a MASH's ham and it was salty.  I also added a 16oz bag of frozen peas.  I didn't have milk and used 1/4 cup of half and half and about a 1/2 cup of leftover sour cream. I didn't have the scrambled egg effect and like another reader I attribute that to having the ingredients cooled before I poured the liquid on top. This literally made 2 casseroles dishes worth! I covered each casseroled with foil to avoid possible drying out as some readers experienced and they turned out perfect.

this one is a bit tough for me to rate because there are the 2 versions of it...as written and with my changes. I think I will give it 3 starts because that is "as written" which is a good base to start from BUT....comes out really dry as other posters noted. With some tweaks it was a hit. My changes.....2 minor ones were use half the salt (with the cheeses and the ham it has plenty of salt already/did not need that much salt) and doubled the parmesan cheese. The big change was with the sauce. That was a big change....1/2 cup of milkl hardly makes any sauce at all.  I made a white sauce: 2 TB of butter, 2 Tb of flour/make a roux and add swiss and parm cheeses. Remove from heat and cool a bit/add the egg.

Very nice.  To accommodate my onion-loathing husband, I omitted that.  I used 1/2 pound fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms, sautéing them in butter instead of oil until the liquid evaporated and the mushrooms were starting to brown.  I also added about a teaspoon of dill weed.  I mixed everything except the Parmesan in the noodle pot, then turned into ungreased baking dish and topped with Parmesan.  I think if one substituted parboiled spuds for the noodles, this would make a tasty brunch dish.

It was a nice change from chicken or beef.  I used elbow pasta instead of egg noodle and cheated with cream of mushroom soup instead of egg and milk and vegatable oil.  I also added in sweet peas.  Was pretty easy to make.

Thank you for a good recipe that does not call for the all- too-common "mushroom soup," or "cheese soup."  I like cooking with real, natural, fresh ingredients.  A good, wholesome, list of ingredients that tastes great!

This reminded me of tuna noodle casserole.  It came out very flavorful but a little dry.  Maybe a little more milk would have done the trick.

This was very good; my entire family loved it.  I used 1.5 cups, instead of 1 cup each, of both cheese and ham; I like more.  Plus, I added and extra 1/2 cup of milk and 1 can of 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom soup to the mixture.  My parents are picky and even commented on how tasty this was.  I have already made this twice.

I love ham and swiss cheese and casseroles so I thought this would be a winner.  It was not.  It was ok but I probably won't make it again.  It wasn't awful, it just wasn't worth the ingredients.  I followed it pretty closely.  I make a similar ham and potato casserole with cheese using whatever cheese I happen to have on hand - usually cheddar or swiss as we don't care for "process American cheese" - tastes like plastic.  Anyway, I'll stick to that from now on.  If I could have given this a 2 1/2 stars that's what I'd have done so I'm being generous with 3 stars.

I pretty much followed the instructions on this one although I did amp up the portions to make it serve more.  I increased the milk, added a can of cream of mushroom soup in place of the mushrooms, and also added peas.  The best suggestion I could make is to cover the casserole w/ aluminum foil because the top of mine was a little dried out when I took it out of the oven.

Three stars for a great start.  When I read the other reviews I didn't know what people meant by "bland" and "dry".  Then I made this recipe and found out.  I really loved the base recipe, but it is not at all "creamy" like you would expect with the name "casserole".  More like "Ham and Swiss Oil and Noodles".  I didn't mind the "scrambled egg" texture even though I read the reviews and tried to avoid it by warming the milk and adding it a little at a time to the eggs as I whisked them.  I would use this recipe as a base, but definitely add probably twice the mixture of milk and egg and possibly a vegetable like broccoli/peas, like others have suggested with a tangy cheese like the sharp cheddar.  Really though, why would you even suggest adding salt when you are using ham?

Has possibilities but I would not make it again using the exact recipe as the eggs scrambled and I did not like the texture. Next time I am going to try adding a can of  cream of mushroom soup and omitting the egg.

I have made this recipe a million times now.  It always comes out well and my whole family loves it.  We don't like mushrooms, so I don't add those and I change out the cheeses, using whatever ones we have in the house.  I normally just shred the cheese instead of cubing it.  It's always delicious!

First, in answer to the previous poster – no, 2 cups is not equal to 16 oz with light things like noodles.  The noodles are measured by weight, not volume.  So 2 cups egg noodles would probably be closer to 8-10 oz.  It’s a very easy mistake to make, though.  

I really liked this recipe.  I changed a few things, mostly due to necessity.  I went to the cupboard and realized I was out of egg noodles, so I used pasta shells.  I added a generous pinch of dry mustard to the milk/egg mixture.  I coarsely shredded the cheese, rather than diced it.  And I did not sauté my onions first because I like the sharper raw-ish onion flavor.  I didn’t use a whole cup, though.

It did have a slight “eggy” texture, but that didn’t bother me.  I liked it.  I eat a breakfast pasta at a local restaurant that is very good and it reminded me of that.  In fact, I may doctor this next time to get it a little closer to that – adding crumbled sausage, an extra egg, and some chopped peppers.  But it is a very good recipe as it is.  Very simple and filling.  If you wanted some color, you could easily add some chopped broccoli or peas before baking.

I thought this was ok, nothing special though. I used sharp cheddar cheese and a little garlic powder to give it added flavor. We don't like mushrooms, so maybe that was what made the difference? I probably won't make this again. I think it is a good starting off recipe though, maybe if you added some chopped broccoli or peas, maybe roasted chicken rather than ham. Easy though, and uses common ingredients I had on hand. I originally had 3 stars on this, but changed to 4 after my husband, a picky eater, absolutely loved it!

My husband and I both really liked this. With the ham, swiss cheese and egg mixture, it really tastes a lot like quiche. Very good.

I had a lot of ham left over so I doubled this recipe. I always cook my ham on the grill so it has a great flavor. I had a whole bag of egg noodles so I used 2 cans of low sodium cream of mushroom soup. I sauteed onion with the squeeze garlic. I added 1/2 cup, or so of whole milk, so it would look so dry. It was not dry, the perfect amount of sauce. I like enough sauce for reheating it. Noodles tend to act like a sponge and suck up the sauce. Pepper and no salt. I also added peas. No eggs and no oil. I used shredded Swiss and mild cheddar cheese. I like a lot so I didn't measure it. I baked it for 30 min with foil on top. Then another 15 without.  It was really good! A great recipe if you have leftover ham.

I added my photo to the group of photos for this dish. Followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I used 6 oz of frozen mushrooms instead of canned. I do think it's a bit weird that they want you to put the Swiss cheese into the skillet to warm with everything else. I think it's best if you only do that VERY briefly just to bring everything together, otherwise you will end up with a stringy mess in your skillet. It came out a bit thin in the 3 quart casserole. I don't see why you couldn't use a 2 quart. It would just be thicker. The noodles made a nice crunchy sort of texture after being baked, and the egg/milk mixture is a good binder. You could probably also add other leftover veggies and it would still be good.

This was a hit with the family.  I did leave out the eggs and used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup milk instead of the 2 eggs and milk.  It was very moist and the flavors were great!!  Even a hit with my teenage son!

I really enjoyed this casserole, even though I accidently over-noodled it, LOL...I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup and almost a cup of milk...I also added peas for some color...the only thing I would change next time is maybe adding the soup mixture into the noodle mixture instead of just putting it on top...just so the noodles wouldn't be so dry...but all in all very good....LOVED the Swiss!!!

This had a good flavor, but wasn't at the top of the list. I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 2 cups of ham, and 2 cups of swiss cheese. Nice and creamy though. Dale enjoyed it, but isn't crazy about ham.

Very easy and tasty!  I sauteed the ham until brown and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions, so the whole dish was very moist and juicy.  We all had seconds.

This was pretty good! I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk since so many people said it was dry. I also substituted peas for the mushrooms due to personal preference.

Very tasty! I added almost a whole can of cream of mushroom w/garlic soup instead of the plain mushrooms, and then mixed it all together. Also doubled the ham to make it more meaty. Also took the advise of another review and let the ingredients cool b4 adding the milk/egg on top. Very good! Husband loved it! Next time I am going to double or triple ingredients to make a lot more servings for more people.

Outstanding, added 1/2 cup sharp chedder 1/2 cup sour cream. My boys (even the picky one) ate every bite.

We made this again, this time we used red skin potatoes sliced thin and layered with the cheese, ham and sourcream mix then baked like before WOW.

This was really good! My family ate just about all of it so next time I will need to make a double batch so there are leftovers.  I did change a few things based on suggestions from other reviewers. I sauteed the onions in garlic and used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of mushrooms. I added just a little bit more milk to the egg mixture as well.

I loved this recipe. I did make a couple provisions. I added broccolli, fat free cream cheese, low fat cheddar-shredded and a can of campbells cheese and broc. soup.  no eggs were used. I put the ingredients into weight watchers and there is 11 points per serving. Very good. My husband loved it.

Quick dinner option that I'll definetly make again.  My 7 yr old didn't like all the onions or the swiss cheese, but I think I can modify the next time for his taste.  I also left out the mushrooms because my family doesn't like them.  I think ti would be awesome with!

I should not review this, but it was awesome place to start.  I did what other said and did the mushroom soup and milk thing.  Then a can of muchrooms with juice.  I add swiss cheese and every cheese going bad in the frig.   t  Mixed the soup and mushroms,pepper no salt as cheese has a lot.  Added more milk, up to the top of the dish and  the para. cheese on the top.  
Turned out great. thank you for the posting.

If I could rate this recipe lower than a 1 star, I would gladly do it. This was horribly dry, and had the most bland flavor. The consistency was just not right with the eggs, noodles, and parmesan. I can't think of anything that could help this dish other than to never make it again.

I thought this was very tasty, as did my picky husband.  I made it exactly as written except used fresh, sliced mushrooms instead of canned and sauteed them with the onions and used shredded chaddar instead of swiss.  I didn't find it to be dry and I didn't get the scrambled egg effect.  I would definitely make again.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!!!

This was great!  I ended up using the cream of mushroom soup, instead of the canned mushrooms and No Yolk egg noodles.  I did get a bit of a scrambled egg texture out of the egg/milk mixture once it was cooked. I might try some sour cream mixed with the milk and eggs next time to make the mixture more creamy, but it doesn't really matter, because it tasted great.

EVERYONE loved this!!!  Don't use a long and wide 3 qt casserole.  (9X13?)Find something that is deeper.  I've made this twice and a deeper 3 qt works better than the usual casserole dish.  Didn't change a thing except for using extra shrooms.  This is good!  Give it up for Cynthia!!

Well I don't even know if I should be rating this recipe because I changed it so much!  I omitted the swiss cheese from the casserole and added 1 can of cream of celery soup and a half can of cream of mushroom soup that I had leftover (in place of the eggs and milk).  I also omitted the parmesan cheese, added fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion/mushroom mixture.  For the topping, I crushed up 12 Ritz crackers and combined with 1 cup of grated old cheddar and 1 Tbsp melted butter.  I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes and in the end, it was a very good/quick meal.

This was very good and had great flavor.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a can of cream of mushroom instead of the egg mixture, but I still used the milk and mixed it with the soup.

I have to say for a super auick meal it was great!  I did not have any of the swiss cheese on hand so i used mozerella instead and I cant use mushrooms when I cook for my mom! but other than those things i think if i would have used the recipe as called for it would have been way better, but i will make it again for sure.

Hubby didn't like this very much.  It is one that I will make again when I know that I will have to have something that doesn't take a whole lot of effort.  I add a can of peas in to get the veggie for my kids.

This was good.  I too added a can of cream of mushroom soup which I felt was a necessary addition.  I substituted the egg mixture for a toasted bread crumb topping (2 tbsp. melted butter & 1/2 c. bread crumbs).  The second time I made this I subsituted sharp cheddar which I preferred over the swiss.

This is to die for.  It's addicting and even better as leftovers.  Asparagus is especially nice served on the side or diced in the casserole.  Thanks a million for the best recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly.  After reading the reviews I even measured out 2 cups of noodles and ended up using about half a 12 oz bag.  It's a good start and I will definitely make it again, but next time with some changes.  I did get the scrambled egg effect, but that was okay.  My noodles did come out dry so next time either more milk or a can of crm of mush. soup.

Great- even my fiancee liked it, and he is quite the picky boy!  I've been forced to remove mushrooms, and he asked that I cut down on the onions.  I missed the step to sautee them, but it didn't seem to matter.  I used apple-smoked swiss cheese and deli honey hame cut about 1/2 inch thick.  These flavors mixed wonderfully together. Thanks for an easy recipe!

Great recipe for leftover holiday ham. I had to add a little chicken broth due to it looking a little dry. I also used whole wheat noodles which were not bad at all. I highly recommend this recipe especially if you have children (my 14 month old LOVED it). A salad goes well with it.

I used my leftover Christmas ham for this recipe. Overall, I liked it very much, however next time I would like try cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Also, I would use shredded cheese, as the cubes of cheese make melted "globs" in the casserole. I would also add more milk to make it creamier. Maybe cream of mushroom soup?

Loved it.  Used whole wheat egg noodles and cheddar instead of swiss.  It was very flavorful.  Watch the time... 30 mins was too long, I guess my 3qt casserole dish is rather shallow.

Thought this was VERY Bland!  It needs something to bring out more flavor!  Not sure if adding a different (sharp) cheese or some other sauce.  I may try it again and doctor it up to see if it is any better.

I didn't like the way the egg mixture just turned into scrambled egg. Adding spinach and wine as noted sounds great. Maybe I'll substitute the noodles with frozen hashbrowns, add the spinach and try it again for a brunch recipe.

I changed it a little bit when I made it.  I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in butter until they were soft and then added 1/2 cup dry white wine and a 1/2 cup spinach.  Cooked it down a little bit, and then put it in the dish to bake.

Great taste, didn’t change the recipe at all except i chose to use fresh mushrooms rather than canned ones (baby portobellos i had on hand worked fine). I pondered if just salt and pepper were enough for seasoning, but left it alone. The Swiss cheese and fresh grated parmesan regianno made the taste really pop beautifully in the mouth. More seasoning would have detracted. So, again, great recipe. Fresh whenever possible just adds a bit more.

I really liked this dish. I didn’t put the mushrooms in and saw on the other reviews that it was dry so I added a can of cream of potato and it was amazing! My husband really liked it as well. I used Italian seasoning and garlic salt as well instead of salt and pepper. Definitely will make this again!

I really liked this. It was a way to use some of my left over Christmas ham. I followed recipe as written except I doubled it.
My family really loved it. Only change I would make was to add more milk. It was a little dryer than I liked. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

It’s pretty basic and boring.  No real depth.  I wouldnt make it again.  I did follow others suggestion and doubled the recipe, used a 13x9, Cream of Mushroom instead of the eggs/fresh mushroom.

I wanted a ham/egg noodle casserole that doesn't use creamed soups.  I have made once as written, then a 2nd time with fresh instead of canned mushrooms.  Both times the eggs separated from the milk and I got the scrambled egg effect with a watery base.  The taste is good, but the presentation is not very appetizing.  I am going to make this casserole using the ham, mushroom, onion, swiss and parmesan ingredients listed but instead with a béchamel sauce with the swiss cheese melted in the béchamel.  I think 1 cup to 1 & 1/2 cup béchamel with the swiss would make the right amount of sauce.  No soup required.

Turned out great.  Used mushroom soup and a bit extra milk for creamier texture based on other reviews otherwise followed the original recipe.  Will definitely have it again.

This was tasty! I realized why it was so dry though. 2C of egg noodles is only about 4 ounces dry. I upped the milk to 1C and used 16oz of elbows (its what I had and I'm feeding a teenager). Family raved about it even though it was still a bit dry. I will definitely be making again. Might work on the liquid amounts some more.

I had leftover ham and decided to try this, and I thought it was just okay. I prefer a casserole that's saucier.  I added an extra egg to this and used fresh mushrooms. The hubby liked it. Not much left.

The final dish looked rather bland in the picture.  So, I used a red onion rather than yellow; cut up a red bell pepper; added about 1 cup of snow peas; used Rotini rather than flat egg noodles.  I baked it at 375 in a convection oven for about 20 minutes.

My husband and kids loved this although I had to change several things because of what I had in the pantry.  I used tuna instead of ham and I didn't have any swiss cheese so I used cheddar.  I'll definitely be making this again and switching it up by using whatever I have on hand!

A versatile dish, you could serve this for dinner or brunch if you wanted to. We quite enjoyed this though, even if the noodles near the top were a bit crunchy and dry in some parts - be sure not to overcook/undercook anything! It might ruin the whole recipe in itself, however this is really good with loads of salt and black pepper.

The casserole turned out kind of dry and salty.  Next time I will cover while baking and omit the salt.  Maybe adding some garlic or other spices will give it a little punch.

This was okay but it needs something to make it creamier. Next time I'll try adding a can of cream of mushroom soup like others suggested. The eggs scrambled a little bit, but it didn't bother me. I'll give this recipe another try with a few changes.

This recipe was not only delicious, but soooo easy to make!!!  I didn't change a thing about it except since we love cheese and ham--I probably tripled the amount that the recipe calls for!!
I will definately make this again and again...thanks sooo much for sharing :0)

Good flavors. Left out the mushrooms since my husband won't touch them. Did get some scrabbled egg effect but was not bothered by it. Reminded me of quiche but with noodles.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. After reading all of the good reviews, it just didn't turn out like I had hoped. It was decent but not yummy. I followed the recipe perfectly but it was lacking something. Not sure what. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway!

pretty good, but make sure you use a deeper casserole dish. I mixed the eggs and milk with a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, good consistency. Try using foil on top of 13x9 caseserole dishes until the last 5-10 minutes.

This is a good, stick to your ribs type of recipe.  There were few changes that I made that included the following: I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup instead of milk and eggs, and I used approx. 1/4 cup of lowfat sour cream to make more cream/sauce.  I gave it a few twists of sea salt (as opposed to recommended serving), and used garlic pepper instead of regular.  It turned out very tasty!  Husband liked it a lot.

This was really pretty good.  I'm not as crazy about ham and cheese as my husband is, but he really enjoyed it.  I omitted the mushrooms and used a cup of frozen peas, and I used a can of cream of mushroom instead of the eggs.  That gave it a very creamy texture that was great.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very good - I used chopped leftover ham.  My husband was wary when I told him what was for dinner, but he enjoyed.  The only problem was that I got the scrambled egg result, and I am not sure what caused it.  I let the noodles sit for a good ten minutes before adding the milk and egg mixture.  Nonetheless, a satisfying meal!

This has great flavor, but I thought it was dry.  I definitely recommend baking it in a casserole dish that is deep rather than wide.  I had too much crunchy top surface even though I baked it for only 20 minutes.  The taste is good enough to warrant some playing with this recipe to make it better--perhaps the addition of cream of mushroom soup as others have done.

This was quick and easy to put together. We try to cut back on eggs, so I omitted them (probably will try them next time). I put in 1 cup of chicken broth for moisture, since I didn't use the milk. Next time I will try the mushroom soup, because it was still rather bland and a little dry. I did add 1/2 pkg of peas and that was good. I'll make it again. Thanks for an easy, quick dinner dish.

This was very good.  I did not have swiss cheese on hand, so I used mozzarella cheese.  I did fine that the top was alittle too crunchy,  but other than that it was great.

we thought this recipe tasted pretty good. i added 1 cup of blanched broccoli florets for color & to avoid having to serve a veggie side dish. i also stirred in a little more milk to help guarantee the casserole came out moist. thanks cynthia!

Fantastic with these changes.  Substituted spinach for frozen peas, added i can creamed onion, used mozarella and added milk to base.  The onion soup really makes a difference and I also added some red pepper.

Since I'm a big fan of Swiss cheese I had to try this.The taste of the cheese really comes through but it's not to the point of overpowering.My only complaint about this recipe is that it serves only 4,I wish I had noticed this before I made this.I was expecting this to last the better part of a week but I had it finished in 3 days.The next time I make this I'll double it.

This is a solid four.  It had a really good flavor when made with my leftover brown suger glazed Christmas ham.  I upped the cheese and milk.  It still was a little dry. I would decrease the amount of noodles next time.  I used a 16 oz bag (2 cups right?) of noodles.  I might just use 8 oz (1 cup) next time.

Loved the casserole. Followed directions as written except that I added extra swiss cheese and parmesan cheese and I also added steamed broccoli, broccoli really added flavor. Did not notice the taste of the mushrooms. We felt that it was very good but a bit on bland side. Next time I make it I will be adding some Sharp cheddar cheese along with the swiss and parmesan and I will be adding more mushrooms and more eggs and milk, seemed a bit dry. After reading other reviews I was wondering What soup mix are you talking about? Also I had no problems with "scrambled egg" effect at all. 
We will definitely make this again

I thought I would love this recipe since I love ham and Swiss cheese.  It tasted fine, but it didn't really come together as a casserole.  And shredded cheese would probably work better than diced, since my diced cheese did not melt completely during the bake time.  I'm not sure if I will try it again.
