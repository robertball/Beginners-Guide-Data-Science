Simple and very good.  The only thing was after I baked them some of the balls fell apart while I was trying to coat them in the powdered sugar....any suggestions on how to keep them from falling apart?

And the purpose of the 2teaspoons water would be...?     
Sorry gail, I did not like the crumbly texture of your peanut butter balls.  (But perhaps that's the way they are supposed to be?)

Made these just now and I had to eat one warm: it's literally like eating a butter cookie with a little tint of peanut butter. If you're looking for rich peanut butter cookies you're in the wrong place but these are still very good.
The only alteration is did was only use 1 cup, 1/3 cup and about 2 tblsp of flour, due to the comments about how crumbly they are. They flattened a little bit so if you really want balls then 1 and 2/3 cup flour would probably work. Melt in your mouth delicious!
