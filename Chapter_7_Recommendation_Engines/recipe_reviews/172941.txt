These were pretty good. Made to the recipe with the exception of the creole seasoning. I was ready to put it in when I found I didn't have any! So added some paprika, basil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. I used my frozen green beans which were a little watery as opposed to store green beans so I ended up cooking them a little longer. I think the butter is unneeded in this dish with all the bacon in it. Unless you use just a couple of Tbsp and saute the onions, peppers, and garlic first, then add the beans and bacon. The bacon also could be cut in half. Had a good flavor, wasn't too spicy for us. I will probably make again. Thanks for the recipe.

These were really pretty darned good and a far cry from plain old cooked frozen green beans.  GREAT way to doctor them up, but I can’t imagine using the amount of cayenne pepper called for.  I can’t imagine there’s an “asbestos tongue” around that could tolerate that kind of heat!  And in our case, I omitted it altogether.  I sautéed the bacon, then added red and yellow bell pepper (rather than green) for color, then the garlic. Once that was cooked and seasoned I added the cooked, French-style green beans.  I used half the amount of bacon called for and it was plenty.  My four star rating is assuming that the directed amount of cayenne will not be included.

Good side dish, did not use the butter b/c bacon had plenty of fat, used cajun spice b/c that's what I had. Many variations of spices can be used with this recipe as a base, will keep subbing and inventing, Thanx for the recipe

I started with fresh green beans, so I blanched them while the bacon cooked to not quite crisp(I only used 3 strips.) I sautees the onions, garlic and pepper until the onions were translucent then added the beans and bacon back in.  Since I make my own Creole seasoning mix, I added 2 tsp and omitted the cayenne,salt and pepper.  The butter was unnecessary doing it this way and the dish was flavorful, the vegetables tender crisp.  This is a nice change from our usual green beans.

I consider this recipe a treat because of the bacon. It is very good and is a good substitute for the typical green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. It worked well with the Turducken this year.

We love these greenbeans.  They're very tasty.  If you like more heat add a little more cayenne pepper.  Also, you can cut the bacon down to half.

These are very delicious.  I omitted the cayenne and left the salt and pepper for the table.  We'll enjoy these again.

Spicy and fattening, but good!  I did not add the extra pepper or cayenne pepper, I only used the creole seasoning (I made "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site).  It was plenty spicy.  I also did not add any salt.  The butter, bacon, onion and garlic mixture smelled heavenly while cooking!  I think you could get by with decreasing the butter by half to reduce the fat in this dish.

Fantastic!! After the first bite I said I was going to make these again.  I will use less butter next time, as advised, but these were so full of taste, it was amazing.  Everyone loved them!

I didn't have frozen greenbeans so I used canned whole green beans. I topped with the bacon instead of cooking it with it. I thought the green pepper was weird with green beans? Will probably make again but without the green pepper.

Pretty much did what Bigshotsmom did.  Used fresh gb's and sauteed the onions, garlic and peppers first then added the gb's and only cooked a couple more minutes until they were cooked but still crispy.  Then added the bacon in last.  I also think the creole has enough heat on it's own and the cayenne is a little un-needed, but that's just IMO.  Great recipe all together though!

This is a very nice side dish.  I used fresh haricot verts and sauteed them in olive oil with my onion, bacon, and garlic, then added diced red pepper (what I had on hand and I like a little color contrast) and creole seasoning.  I used about 1/4 teaspoon of cayene based on the previous reviews.  They were very tasty.  A great side dish for summer grilling recipes.

I had to leave out the bacon, onion and bell pepper, but we really enjoyed the cajun seasoning.  I would definitely use the bacon and onion next time.

These taste incredibly awesome! However, they do NOT need that extra cayenne if you use a Creole seasoning that already has it, it was super spicy- but, to be fair, I was given a warning :)  I will make this again, because it's delicious- but next time no extra cayenne for me.

Replaced the bacon with tasso, excellent idea!  We used canned beans so it didn't re-heat well, but otherwise it was great.

This was very tasty, prepared as directed; my only tweak was to use a red bell pepper for color contrast. The only part that didn't work out per the recipe was the initial "cook until the onions are transparent, about 2 minutes". In increments of 2 minutes, I would stir and raise the heat, and repeat; in about 10 minutes (ending at medium-high heat), the onions became translucent. Many people said the fat was too much and the amount of spices were at nuclear level; there is A LOT OF FAT and A LOT OF SPICY SPICES, but in the end, I think the high fat content reduced the severity of the spices. I served with sauteed chicken andouille sausage slices and white rice prepared with chicken broth. I think the accompanying white rice also helped to calm the residual spiciness. This dish did not exceed our 2-alarm chili spiciness tolerance. I would definitely make this again, just not during the week prior to having blood tests drawn.

Reduced butter to 1 T., cut bacon in half, omitted cayenne and doubled Cajun seasoning.  Very very good.  Will repeat.  Paired with grilled chicken with Dinosaur BBQ Creole Honey Mustard sauce.

This was great!  I didn't use the green pepper(my husband doesn't like it).  I cut the spices in half and was still too spicy for my kids, but I loved it.
