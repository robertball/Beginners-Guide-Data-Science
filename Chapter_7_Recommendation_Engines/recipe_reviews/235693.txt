This recipe was really good. A couple of things, 1) Use whatever sausage you like. It doesn't have to be buffalo chicken sausage as the rest of the seasonings in the dish wouldn't ruin any type of sausage. 2) I'm guessing you could add any type of fresh herb at the end as well. We didn't use parsley, but instead used cilantro and it was great.

This is delicious!  I made it with shrimp instead of sausage, and used regular parsley.

This recipe was really good. My wife doesn't like buffalo chicken so I used garlic chicken sausage instead and it was great. I will definitely make this dish again.

I made this dish vegetarian by eliminating the sausage and cooking the quinoa in vegetable broth.  Came out great!

We eat it hot.   Roasted the butternut squash first before adding it right before mixing it all together. Yum!

I have not tried this recipe. But I do plan on making this for our Christmas family dinner as my passing dish. I can't wait to taste it.

Great hot or cold. My spouse who doesn't like butternut squash or quinoa cleaned her plate. Works great with any sausage.

This is an incredibly flavorful dish. I made it vegan (omitting chicken and subbing vegetable stock) and found it to be tasty without any modifications. That's the mark of a perfect recipe in my opinion.

Hearty and delicious! Dress it up with goat cheese and/or walnuts. Or, as other reviewers have said, make it vegan by switching to vegetable stock and removing the sausage.

This was pretty good. I would have found it bland if not for the buffalo chicken sausage.  Next time I will roast all the veggies for more texture (and keep them larger - not diced onion and shredded carrot) and probably add some garlic to the quinoa.

This was OK, but nothing to write home about. A few modifications: Make sure to rinse the quinoa before cooking to take away the bitter flavor. Second, the recipe does not mention when to add the red pepper, so I added it with the rest of the veggies. After the veggies cooked, I deglazed the pan from the sausage with a little white wine and added it to the mix. It still lacks a little flavor in my opinion.
