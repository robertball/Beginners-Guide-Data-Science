Skip the spoon to dip truffles. Use a plastic fork and break out the middle to tongs. Works much better! The coating can drip off better and the truffle slides off the two prongs easily!!

Very very good. The only reason I gave these a 4 instead of a 5 is because they melt as soon as you pick them up, so you have to keep them constantly refrigerated and eat them quickly! Rich and wonderful. They are beautiful if you can get the coating on smoothly. I suggest wearing latex gloves so you don't get fingerprints on them.

These are delicious.  Instead of using a spoon, I put toothpicks in them and it works a lot better for dipping and eating.

Wow - taking the butter out is definitely the key to melting this chocolate.   Once we did that, these were fabulous.    Wish I'd read the reviews before diving in.  We will make this again - they were great!

i had problems with scooping out the chocolate mixture as well.  it was pretty liquidy so i let it sit for about 1 hour and was able to roll the chocolates into balls, then i placed them onto the wax paper and in the fridge for about 10 minutes.  this made them a lot easier to dip and not have to worry about them melting in the milk chocolate mixture.  the tongs trick was definitely easier than using the spoon.  an alteration i made on an earlier mistake was adding disaronno into melted semi-sweet chocolate in a makeshift double boiler (small pot below and metal mixing bowl on top) as soon as i put the disaronno into the melted chcolate it harden to more of a fudgey texture, i rolled those into balls and dipped them in the extra milk chocolate as well.  these were a hit at my potluck

Pretty good. But the mixture stuck to my melon baller so I ended up using my fingers. I made half of them with semisweet and half of them with ghiradelli white chocolate.I rolled some in walnuts mixed with brown sugar,some in crushed heath toffee bits, and the rest in hershey's cocoa mixed with sugar to make up for the unsweetened cocoa. great for v-day!

I followed the recipie but I could not spoon the chocolate onto the pan. It was way to liquidy. I placed the pot into the freeser to cool it right down. after and hour i took it out and spooned in onto cookie sheet and back into the freezer. the muixure spread right out into disks. They taste good but are a huge mess. I was unable to even dip them.

These are absolutely DELICIOUS! I made these for my boyfriend for our two-year anniversary/Valentines day, and he LOVED them (as well as my mom and her friends). I used Ghirardelli chocolate and also, after they had been dipped in the semisweet chocolate, I sprinkled a little bit of sea salt on them, as I think it tastes amazing that way.
Great recipe! I'm already planning on making it again sometime this week!

I was not impressed by these truffles. My idea of a perfect truffle is one that can even be delicious if no flavoring is added. This truffle is mediocre, only if you add a flavored extract. Even then, they are lacking. They are not smooth or rich, but almost taste like you are biting into an old Hershey bar. I used Ghirardelli chocolate, and it still turned out bland! Another problem with this recipe is unless you are making teeny tiny truffles, there is no way you will get 50 out of this. Even after making them smaller than regular truffles, I only got 30. I will stick to my Alton Brown truffles from now on.

i always wanted to try to make some truffles, now i know they are more trouble then they're worth.  very rich & messy to make & a lot of work for not a lot of reward.  can't make with kids around, too fast paced trying to get them back in the fridge all the time.  i'll stick with cookies...

This recipe is amazing! Very easy to follow, and simple to do for such fabulous results! I've always dreaded trying something like this due to the lack of a double boiler, but this was so simple. For the milk chocolate I bought the stuff that you just toss in the microwave and melt, and it worked wonderfully! Saved loads of mess!

these were pretty good, but I'd stick to the basic recipe, I tried to mix it up a bit by using a bit of marshmallow cream with the center, not a good idea, however I did add mint flavoring to it and that was very good!

this is a simple and yummy recipe.  when i made it instead of using the light cream i used flavored coffee creamer (hazelnut and vanilla), it set up wonderfully and gave the chocolate a hint of more flavor

DELICIOUS! The only problem I had was covering the milk chocolate with the semi-sweet without melting the center.  I found it easiest to roll the milk chocolate up and chill it in the freezer.  Also, I let the semi-sweet cool down as well.  They weren't pretty, but they were good when it was all said and done.

These were way more trouble than they were worth. I used expensive Belgian chocolate so they'd be really good, but it was such a hassle, and made such a mess. I had chocolate up to my elbows. I added mint to one batch, and it did make a good french mint flavor, but I would have rather just eaten my chocolate bars without all the trouble!

These taste delicious! I would recommend after melting the chocolate and putting in the cream and vanilla to spread the chocolate out on a pan with wax paper and stick it in the freezer for about 30-45 minutes- enough to where you can roll the chocolate into a ball with your hands. Use a spoon to scrap the chocolate into the size you prefer. By this time, it shouldn't be sticky and should be easier to cover with chocolate too. I used Kroger white chocolate candy coating for the outside layer. Once I was finished coating them I stuck the tray in the refrigerator over night. They were fantastic! My friends and family (especially kids) loved them!

This is an excellent recipe - very easy to make and everyone loves them so they don't last long.  I used toothpicks to coat them, which makes it much easier and not messy at all.  I also used butterscotch flavoured chips which made them taste fantastic.  Experimenting with different chocolate, flavours, and chips until you find the right one for you is highly recommended.
