This cake is wonderful--delicious and easy to make.  I found that it tasted better, when I used two 9oz. Jiffy yellow cake mixes (without pudding in the mix) for the topping. I've made this about 5 times, and everyone loves it.

This recipe is four stars to me the way it's written, but I found a better way after making this a million times. It always bugged me to use so much margarine or butter on top, just to moisten the cake mix. But if i tried cutting back the amount of margarine, it turned out dry and yucky on top. So next i tried half a cup of margarine melted and 1/4 cup of water and that made it soggy and yucky too. So I tried softening only one stick of margarine in the microwave and then mixing it in the cake mix with a fork in a large bowl, like a streusel topping until it looked like coarse crumbs. Then sprinkle it with your fingers on top. It turned out looking much better and crumbly looking and nicely browned but saved half a stick of butter or margarine. It also improved the presentation appearance of the dish!

Wonderful. Used 4 eggs for a firmer texture.  Spread dry spice cake mix and dropped pats of butter (about 1 1/2 cups -- we love butter) across the top. The butter melted and made a crispy topping. I skipped dinner and went straight to dessert!

When I took this cake from the oven rich aroma of the season lured my downstairs neighbor up to my door wanting to know what I had baked.  She ran downstairs to put on a fresh pot of coffee and we had two pieces of this fabulous "pie cake" while it was still warm from the oven! Yummers!!! One thing I did do was before I baked it I toasted the walnuts then I sprinkled them over the cake.  I have shared this recipe with four people so far.

Very nice!  Just a tad bit on the sweet side, so next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar I add and cut back on the cake mix topping.  The pumpkin mix on the bottom was very pie-like; and the topping had a nice crunch to it.  We will do this one again---only less sweet.

There simply is no better use for pumpkin, it is unbelieveably delicious. I'm not exaggerating.

Not so good!  The pumpkin filling was great, but the topping was too sweet.  I would have liked to have some type of bottom crust, but the topping was not at all what I was looking for.  If I knew it was going to turn out like that I would have just made a pie.  No one in my family liked it and I ended up throwing the entire cake (with the exception of 2 pieces) away.  I was very disapointed.

This has long been a favorite of our family and friends. One change that I learned from my Gram years ago is to use Butter Pecan cake mix instead of the yellow - that really makes it taste like a brown sugar type crisp topping.  Yummy with fresh whipped cream on top!!!

Everyone in my family loves this cake and wants the recipe. My daughter has a birthday in October and even chose this over the traditional cake. Even though it was easy before, I did find a cheater way to make it - bought pumpkin all ready for pumpkin pie and only have to add eggs and evaporated milk.

Amazing! I didn't use the walnuts because I didn't have any and used white cake mix instead of the yellow.

I was excited to make this as it sounded great from the reviews but unfortunately, my family didn't enjoy it at all.  The combination of ingredients is good but the topping comes out too sweet - probably the combination of melted butter with the powdered cake mix - pure sugar.  Also, the cake didn't rise as much as I expected which made for quite a dense, moist dessert.  Moist is good, but a lighter cake would have been better.

I brought this to church tonite. Brought the pan home empty. Many asked for the recipe. All I did different was use the Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix instead of pumpkin and spices. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was FANTASTIC!! I may never make pumkin pie again! I made this as written except for adding another egg and it was so good I didn't want to share it. Wasn't too sweet at all. I used a Pillsbury golden butter cake mix so maybe the brand you use makes a difference.

I liked the filling for this cobbler-like dish, but I did not care for the topping.  I mixed the butter with the cake mix as suggested by others.  It just didn't seem to have the topping taste I was looking for.  I'll try it with a different topping possibly.

I always get rave reviews when I bring this to a party. I cover with foil for first 30 minutes of baking so nuts (I use pecans) don't get over-cooked.  Probably my oven or where my rack was placed first time I made it...who knows!  Super yummy! Thanks!

This has become a favorite at our house. But not only with my crew... It's now a much requested dish for potlucks or when company comes over. If you make this, go ahead and prepare some copies of the recipe- you WILL be asked!!

No, this was not a big hit with my family! Not really a cake at all, it's more like a crustless custard?! The cake mix just sat on top of the pumpkin and didn't get absorbed. I don't think I will try this again.

*Much* better when chilled. I used a spice cake mix and sprayed with butter spray, which gave me the toasted color all over.

The filling didn't come out very well.  It was a weird consistency and tasteless.  I put in spices that I've used for other recipes but it didn't help at all

I used sliced almonds in the place of the walnuts (which make my throat itch) and brought the cake to book club. The ladies loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

The only tip I have to is make sure all the cake topping is covered with butter (I found it best to make my cake concave in the center).  Batter where the butter cannot spread will stay powdery and be a bit of a bummer.

My family loves this cake! I use 15oz of pumpkin instead of 29oz and follow the directions for milk eggs and spices as indicated on can of pumpkin. It only takes 45 minutes or so to bake, the pumpkin layer is much thinner and crust is crunchier(if there is such a word).Also I don't put the nuts on. My son who does not like pumpkin pie loves this dessert. Serve with cool whip and you will think you have died and gone to heaven....!

This is delicious and so simple. I couldn't find my recipe for pumpkin pie cake, and used this as a substitute--well, this is my new recipe!!! Not too sweet, with lots of pumpkin flavor. In response to the person who gave it only a few stars because the cake sat on top and didn't get absorbed---that is exactly what the recipe is suppose to do. The cake makes a streusel-like topping. Yummy!!!

With the walnuts, the recipie needs more sugar, but without it's fine. A little bland for my tastes, but my husband loved it.

If there was even a possible rating of 10 stars, I'd give it just that. This was a wonderful recipe and will definately share it even on non-holidays. Thanks for sharing this Christine!!!
