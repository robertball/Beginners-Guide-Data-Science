Recipe Group: Creamy and comfy! This is a very nice rice dish. I made instant brown rice while I mixed everything else up, then popped it in the oven while I made a salad. Served it in flour tortillas with sautéed onion, garlic, mushrooms and corn. Super yummy, thanks for sharing the recipe!

Outstanding.  Simply outstanding.  I had to cobble this together using ingredients I had on hand, so bear with me.  Halved recipe as just hubby & I, didn't have enough sour cream so I had to supplement with about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt; out of Monterey Jack so used a combo of white American and cheddar;  out of chopped canned peppers, so used a few diced jalapenos I had available.  Yeah, I know.  But don't care.  Because this was delicious.  Served with BBQ pork chops, tossed green salad, and corn.  Thanks SO much for recipe - we loved it!

I made this for the Buzz Recipe Group Selection for March 7, 2015. This earned a 5 star rating at our house - WE LOVED IT.  The only tweak I made was to make 4 servings instead of 8.  We loved the slightly tart and creamy texture of the  Monterey Jack cheese,  sour cream and basmati rice in this recipe. I only had to bake for 20 minutes.  We enjoyed this as a side dish with baked chicken.  Thank you, bryantgal31 for sharing your easy and delicious recipe.

Recipe Group selection 3/7/15.  I made half a recipe for DD and me and I built our meatless Monday dinner around it.  The only change I made was to use a Mexican cheese blend rather than the Montery Jack and Cheddar.  It was rich, creamy, and very satisfying.  The green chilis were perfect.  Thank you Bryantgal31, this recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! Didn't change a thing, and won't next time either! This dish is mild (which is great for me) but still has that great chili flavor. Also great dish because it lends well as a side dish for many types of entrees. I served as a side to pork steaks and asparagus.  Husband and I both ate way too much!

Super yummy, easy and quick. Thank you. I used only 2 cups mixed cheddar and jack cheese, total, and about 1/3 cup green chili sauce or maybe even less because that's what I had on hand and it was still delicious!

This was good not great. It just wasn't flavorful enough. It was VERY bland/thick/creamy as other reviewers thought. Will search out a different rice recipe instead next time or maybe just add some key ingredients/spices to try to make this one have more flavor...gave it 3 out of 5 stars but would have rather given it 2.5 stars if I could.

BIG HIT! I used a box of yellow rice that I wanted to use up and 1/2'd all the other ingredients. Nice creaminess and great flavor. This went perfectly w/ our chicken enchiladas and sweet corn cake tonight...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely delicious. The only thing I really changed over multiple times of making this dish is to use slightly less than 2 cups of sour cream. It’s an easy recipe to experiment with and you can substitute as needed. I’ve used instant rice for ease and it turned out just fine. I’ll also add hot sauce for extra kick or more cheese for extra comfort food feeling. This is on frequent rotation at my house as my stepson always asks for it. In fact, I’m making it now. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband said it was "The Bomb".  He just loved it.  (I knew he would).  I didn't have the green chilies on hand so I put jalapenos instead.  My husband likes things spicy.

Love this. I didn't know till I made it and tasted it that this is a dish my mom use to make when I was younger. I always loved it. Now my whole family loved it. Is a little high on fat side but so quick and easy to make. You can always add things to it to like chicken, bacon, broccoli etc. Deffently a heart side dish or main dish.

Recipe Group Selection:  07, March 2015 ~ LOVED this dish!  I made a half a batch using sticky rice.  I didn't measure the cheeses just eyeballed and know I used a little less of each.  It is nice and creamy and went really well with 'Fajita Quesadillas' and 'Quesadilla Jalapeño Spread', both from AR.  I'm sharing this recipe with my mom and SIL's as I know they will all love it.  Thanks bryantgal31, for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper.

I didn't add chillies--added crabmeat, cut spinach, cooked egg and grated carrots. I also used Mexican cheese which had Monterey Jack. Also a difference in the rice --I used the typical rice vinegar, sugar and salt recipe for sushi since I had left over sushi rice. It was really good!

I made this but didn't use nearly the amounts of cheese or sour cream. Probably cut them in half and it was creamy enough.  Really good flavor.

I had some dental work done so have to eat soft food. Got bored with mashed potatoes, pudding and applesauce so went rice recipe hunting and found this!  It's easy to make, very flavorful and lots of protein to help keep me full!  Thank you so much for posting this!

I have a friend out west who makes this all the time. My husband fell in love with it when she made it for us. I use whatever cheese i have on hand, this time it was a taco/nacho cheese blend. You can add fresh chopped jalapenos to give it a little more spice. So easy and a different spin on rice. Thanks for sharing...

I didn't do the original  recipe because the reviews talked about how bland it was. I cooked the rice in chicken broth, only used 1/2 cup of sour cream and added chives, that was probably the best part added to the dish

My new go-to dish for company. Goes with chicken, fish, or steak. Everyone loves it. I used smoked basmati rice a couple times which I love but it is an unnecessary change. I leave out the butter.

made tonight with some left over jasmine rice. cu back on the sour cream and grated montery jack cheese. Stepped it up a notch and used jalepeno cheese and garlic salt instead of  regular salt. Mild with a little kick turned out to be a nice side dish. thank you for sharing

Too much cheese. I would say even less than half would be sufficient. Did not like this at all.

Used a bit more rice, jalapeño jack cheese and jalapeños vs green Chiles. Also used low fat sour cream since that is what I had.

Very good.  Served with fajitas.

Recipe Group 3/07/2015.  Very good, a nice twist on rice casserole.  I made it as written and would not change a thing.
