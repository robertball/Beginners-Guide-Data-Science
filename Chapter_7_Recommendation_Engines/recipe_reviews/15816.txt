I make this pie all the time and everyone loves it! I use the fat free sweetened condensed milk and it tastes just as good! I also allow my cans to cool for 40 minutes on one side, then flip over for another 40 minutes. If not, there is a build-up of pressure and it's a pain to open the cans. I let the pie cool in the fridge for at least 8 hours, otherwise the caramel is not sweet. Be sure to add the cool whip after it has cooled b/c it will melt if the pie is still warm. I also garnish with mini chocolate chips.

Great simple recipe.  To the other reviewer, let the can completely cool before opening.  You can boil more at the same time for another pie later.  This is the O'Charleys Caramel Pie.  We made them the very same way when I worked there way back when.  The best Caramel Pie on this site.

Thank you for this recipe!  It is absolutely delicious.  I made it as the recipe states the first time.  The second time I made it, I put the cans of sweetened condensed milk in a slowcooker all day, and it turned out great.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to boil the cans a little longer to have a thicker pie. It turned out wonderful! But I agree with the user who said to let the cans cool for 40 min. then flip and cool for another 40 min. It helps the caramel to thicken for a fuller pie, not runny. I topped this with cool whip then drizzled caramel on top....it was a smash hit for a quick version!

My mother and I are huge fans of the O'Charley's caramel pie and that's why I tried this recipe. It was exactly the same! I let the two cans of sweetened condensed milk boil for three hours. Then I let them cool in the can for 40 minutes. After that I poured them into the graham cracker crust and refrigerated for 8 hours before topping with whip topping.

You only need a small piece of this pie because it is very sweet.  It is a good recipe and the caramel is real.

Best ever! So easy, so good. I filled 24 mini-tart shells, skipped the whipped topping, and they were a hit at the Christmas Eve party. I even have a can leftover for next time!

This recipe is awesome!!!
It tastes EZACTLY like the one from O'Charleys which rocks b/c that is what I was trying to make.
The only thing I did differently from the recipe was take the condensed milk out of the can and put it into the heatproof bowl and stirred every 15 minutes for about 2 1/2 hours.  I DID NOT BOIL IN THE CAN.  I also used Fat Free Sweetened condensed milk.  It was SOOO good!!!!

I love this recipe. I have made it the past two years for the holidays. I have never had anyone tell me it has an aftertaste. I only get asked to make more and more every year. I cook mine 3 hours and then leave in the can for an hour out of the water to cool. Then I refrigerate it for 8 hours. Yummy!

I don't remember what life was like before this pie!  It is awesome--- I'm constantly being asked to make it.  Must add that I only boil the cans for 2 hours, just as good!
Most the time anymore, we substitute all ingredients with fat-free-----fat-free whip cream, fat-free sw. condensed milk, & even the fat-free graham cracker crust.  Makes no difference in taste---delish!

Once this pie was finished, it was truly delicious, and our friends were coming over just to steal pie out of the refrigerator. However, the cans kind of exploded when I opened them after three hours of boiling. No damage done (except to the paint in my kitchen)... Did I boil them too long?

I have been making this for 20 years.  I always put the cans of milk in boiling water. I place the cans on there side. Then turn it down to simmer. I simmer for 4 to 5 hours.  I may roll the cans a couple of times.  Just make sure the water continues to cover the cans. Also let the cans cool before opening.  (common sense).  I put pecans and whip cream on top.  You need to cut the slices then because it is so rich.  Everyone will think you spent hours over a pot stirring. lol

Time consuming, but well worth the wait!  I boiled the cans of sweetened condensed milk for 2 1/2 hours, took them out and let them cool for 40 minutes, flipped them over and allowed them to cool for another 40 minutes.  I garnished with nuts and mini chocolate chips.

This pie was okay, very sweet.  It probably would have been better with on top of apples or bananas, but not plain.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  Amazing to me that boiled swt. cond. milk could taste exactly like melted caramels. I used regular pie crust, since that's the way I've had this pie before.

Love it! Love it!  I boil my cans for 3 hours and 30mins.  Turns out great. I like to coat the pie crust with melted chocolate and top with chocolate shavings.

I made this pie for the first time this afternoon and it turned out perfect! I topped it off with a tower of meringue and will let it sit overnight before we cut into it. I DID boil the cans directly in a large stockpot for 3 hours and let them cool flipping the cans so they cooled evenly. This pie really does taste like liquid caramels. My husband, the sweetaholic was very surprised to learn that the filling was 2 cans of boiled sweetened condensed milk! I recommend this recipe, takes a few hours for cooking/cooling, but well worth it.

YUMMY!  Tasted exactly like O'CHarley's version.  Just make sure you don't let water run our of pan when boiling the cans.  I let water level get just a little too low and the contents of one of the cans was slightly burnt at the top.  It was still delicious though!

I felt there was a small aftertaste with this too, but I don't know if that was because I used fat-free milk?  Next time I will try reduced-fat to see if that helps.  I poured these into mini phyllo tart shells, garnished with Cool Whip and mini chocolate chips.  No problems with them being runny and found they were easier to put out for entertaining.  Easy and pretty good!

Wow, this was really good. I don't typically like things that are super sweet and rich, but small servings are worthwhile. I kept mine in the freezer so it lasted a lot longer. Otherwise it started to get goopy. It's so cool what happens to the milk when you cook it in the can!

The flavor of this was great--very rich and creamy just like caramel. However, it never "set up" so the pie is a runny mess. I let it cool on the counter, then refrigerated it until serving time.

I covered it with a layer of melted milk chocolate and chopped pecans.

This was perfect! I boiled the cans on medium for 4 hours. Then, I let them cool almost to room temperature. The consistency of the caramel when it came out of the cans was like the jelled cranberry sauce (i.e. it plopped out of the can and kept the shape of the can). The caramel was spreadable. It set perfectly in the refrigerator. I hope this helps the people that ended up with runny pies!

I am a bit lazy, so I boiled in the cans, making sure they were cooled before opening them, as heating something with a constant volume increases pressure. This pie was unbelievably good. Just like O'Charley's.

Delicious! I boiled the cans for 2 hours the first time I made it and the pie was a little runny after chilling overnight. The second time I made it, I boiled them for closer to 3 hours and had a thick, creamy pie. I sprinkled mini chocolate chips and pecan pieces on top and covered with whipped cream. Yum! I've also used the mini graham cracker crusts for individual desserts- so cute!

I am giving this 3 stars because it took so long to make this and it was soooo sweet, I even made my own whipped cream by whipping heavy cream until stiff (without powdered sugar to cut the sweetness) and it was still very sweet. My nieces and nephews had a piece each and they thought it was very sweet also! They are are 11 and 12 so they love sugar but this was too much for them! The adults did not like it much. I had a piece and thought it was okay. For the effort it took to make this I did not think it was worth it. I will not make again. thank you anyway.

This recipe took me 3 1/2 hours, but I may not have been simmering my water on a high enough heat.  I stirred every fifteen minutes as one other reviewer said.  Let me tell you it was WORTH IT!!!  Everyone wanted to try the caramel pie!  EVERYONE loved it.  A little goes a long way.  Many of them paired it with a piece of apple pie.  In the future, I may try it without the whip cream and top with apples of some sort!

This makes a wonderful pie. It is sweet, rich, and so easy! I am extremely glad to see that the recipe no longer calls for boilding unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk. Please never do that. I did it once, and when I opened the still-warm can,the pressure difference caused hot caramel to shoot out onto my face.Ouch!

I made this recipe 10-15 years ago.  It was always wonderful! My husband lectured me on the safety issues of Boiling an unopened can of ANYTHING for hours. "It will EXPLODE", he explained! Sure enough, shortly thereafter there were 60 Minute stories on that exact thing.  Also around that time, the Eagle Brand Milk I used put a warning on the label...Caution - Never Heat Unopened Can.  Needless to say, I haven't made the recipe since but I am still for looking for something that is as YUMMY as I remembered it was.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. It reminded me of O'Charley's Ooey Gooey Caramel pie. I made the sweetened condensed milk for 4 hrs and a day ahead of time so it would be just right to put in the graham cracker shell. I made it and after the first piece was taken out it started to run to the open space. Should I have whipped it with mixer or what. It was thick and creamy when I put it in the pie shell. I made sure to keep it refrigerated but it sunk in anyway. What can I do next time to keep it from sinking into the extra space? I want it to set up like pies should.

Absolutely delicious!  Wonderful caramel flavor.  I used the chocolate graham cracker crust as another reviewer suggested...loved it.  There was absolutely no negative "aftertaste" as one reviewer mentioned.  Maybe it was the brand of milk they used?  Plan to start this recipe at least 5 hours in advance though, as it takes awhile to cool down even after the pie is prepared.

I love this pie!  It is so easy to make, and it is a HIT wherever I go.  I use a regular flour crust instead of graham cracker, just because it is my preference.  Very easy and little to no mess!

I love this recipe, it's so easy, it takes 3 hours but you can walk away and leave it to boil while doing other things.  My husband thought it at a strange aftertaste so I've started adding a large dollop of heavy cream (whipped) to the recipe and blending it. It smoothes out the flavour and the appearance.

I didn't like this very well.  My family didn't care for it either and I followed the directions exactly.  I thought it tasted very blah.

This recipe was really easy.  It was a little bland on flavor to me though.  Next time I will probably use some sort of butterscoth or carmel extract to give it more of a creamy flavor.

cooked this for the in-laws family visit/dinner, without having previously tried. OMG! follow instructions and it is soooo easy to do. i used a ten inch pie crust and added an extra can of condensed milk, and used 1/12 tubs of cool whip with crushed skors toffee on top and curled chocolate ribbons.  The family was fighting over who could have the last of it. huge hit in this house hold. definatly a keeper.

I made this For Thanksgiving.
I was skeptical, because it seemed very "gloppy"
but after letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours, it sliced perfectly.
However, it was so sweet, that even I--the sugar queen-- could barely finish a whole slice. 
But it does taste just like caramel!
not sure if i will make it again.

Loved it and can't believe how easy it was. Kept me in the house but well worth it!  The only warning I have is don't use a coated pot. The cans will ruin it. It eats at the finish but yummy dessert!!!

Made it for the first time yesterday, just a bit too sweet.  I added apple to mine for Carmel apple pie, the apples were delicious. Carmel was just too much.

Incredibly rich!  But I walked on the wild side by serving this at Thanksgiving without having tasted it first.  What a hit!  I used a chocolate grahame cracker shell and topped it with Cool Whip and sprinkled toffee brickle bits on top.  No one could believe it when I told them how it was made.  It was such a time saver to make with impressive results.  You need to try this!

This recipie was quite delicious.  The only drawback was the three hours it takes to make.
