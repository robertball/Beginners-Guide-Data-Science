I didn't find this fast or easy as others said . I sweated the eggplant first . I also added roasted garlic and spinach to the ricotta mixture. It was fantastic.
This is a great recipe that has alot of room to add and play with.

I've made this twice and really enjoy it. I made a lighter version the second time though. Instead of using a whole egg and frying it, I used a couple of eggwhites mixed with a little water. I dipped that in bread brumbs and put them under the broiler about 5 minutes per side on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. It takes no extra time really. I also used part skim ricotta.

I didn't use the prosciutto.  I added chopped spinach to the ricotta cheese instead.

This was wonderful!  I am a huge eggplant rollatini fan but this was the first time I attempted it on my own and it turned out great - even my husband, who has never been an eggplant fan, loved it!  The only change I made was to add some fresh basil to the ricotta.  I also made my own basic sauce, lots of fresh basil and tomatoes.

This was great! Instead of proscuitto, I mixed some cooked sausage (which I took out of the casing and browned on the stove) with the ricotta. I also added parsley to the ricotta. Outstanding!

So great! I made it a point to "sweat" out the slices to rid the bitterness.

This recipe was fantastic! I did make some healthy modifications and the recipe was still five stars so I thought I would share.  First, I breaded the eggplant using panko bread crumbs and italian seasoning. Then, I broiled it instead of frying. It took about 5 minutes on each side (or until brown/crispy). Then I used low fat ricotta (which cuts the fat significantly). I did add some italian seasoning and about a 1/4 cup each of parmesan and asiago cheese to the ricotta for extra flavor (this added some fat, but increased the flavor- of course could leave it out also). I substituted fresh spinach for the prosciutto and instead of using jar sauce, I made up a quick sauce with just organic diced (for texture) and crushed tomatoes, lots of garlic and basil, salt, pepper to taste. Let it simmer while I was preparing the eggplant (about 30 minutes). The result was perfect. The eggplant retained it's form and didn't get mushy (one of my gripes about eggplant parmesan) and the flavors were wow! Enjoy!

Thanks for this recipe! I don't know why I never made this from scratch before! I usually make eggplant like Lasagna. I did not use Prosciutto. And I didn't peel the eggplant, I left the skin on. Also soaked it for a little bit first. I made a ricotta cheese mixture that I do for lasagna which is ricotta, egg, Italian Medley seasoning and shredded mozzarella...I mix it all together before spreading it on the eggplant. I think next time I'll add garlic powder to the bread crumbs and spinach to the ricotta mixture. I also want to broil it instead of fry it next time. Of course I use LOTS of shredded cheese on top! It was yummy! I'll be making this for my daughters 3rd B-day party in December rather than paying $35 for half tray for it from my local deli (but theirs is really good too).  Thanks for sharing!!!

I can eat eggplant made this way.  Even the kids ate it and liked it. I sweated it out with salt as suggested, added spinach, garlic S&P and nutmeg to the ricotta, had to make my own breadcrumbs and pasta sauce because i ran out.  Kind of labor intensive though, not a great recipe for a weeknite without all the ingredients on hand premade. Probably took 1.5 hrs total for making 7 rolls.  and you use more than 2 tbspn of EVOO to fry.  Leftovers were good as well. had w/ brown rice. would make again for a weekend meal

Being of Italian descent - Mom & Gramma gave me a tip to make this dish so much easier.  First slice egplant lengthwise 1/8".  Coat slices w/flour then dip in eggwash.  No breadcrumbs!  Then fry in oil.  Cool & drain on papertowels.  Stack slices when cool - wrap in foil then into a freezer bag & into freezer.  When you want to make this dish just defrost.  The hard part is over!!

This was great. I don't see the point though in rolling up -- unless you are having company or a nice dinner, and then it's a great touch. Otherwise, save yourself some time on a weeknight dinner and do as others have suggested and layer. I followed some other hints and sweated the eggplant and also broiled the breaded slices to avoid frying them. I did this for five mintues per side. Then I layered this way in a glass baking dish: eggplant, ricotta, spinach (another addition that caught my eye in someone else's review), prosciutto, tomato sauce, and mozarella cheese. Baked at 350 for about 20 minutes or so, until the cheese was melted and starting to brown. We loved this and will make it again.

I followed Chuckster's variation and then made two additional slight modifications.  I chose to go with Chuckster's changes because I preferred baking the eggplant slices rather than frying them to avoid the extra oil.  I also liked sweating the slices first with salt.  While I don't find eggplant particularly bitter (which is why many people start with this step), I think it helped soften the slices, making them more pliable and easier to roll up.

I sliced the eggplant about 1/8 inch rather than 1/4, using a mandoline.  My guess is that made  the slices even easier to roll up.  Second, I used cottage cheese rather than ricotta because that is what I had on hand (and I use cottage cheese rather than ricotta when I make lasagna). 

Even though I suspect I had more rolls because I sliced the eggplant thinner, I still had enough of the cheese mixture for the filling as written.  I did find the sauce a little skimpy and will use two jars next time to make sure I have enough to cover the rolls so they don't dry out and to serve with the rolls and angel hair.

Can't wait to make it again!

This was delicious and pretty easy to make. I think basil or garlic are a good addition to the ricotta because it's a little bland otherwise.

I absolutely love eggplant rollatini and this is the first time I have made this. I do not think I sweated the eggplant long enough because it was a little bitter. Next time I will sweat longer than 30 minutes. Also, I used a lot more EVOO and I do not think that the eggplant was cooked long enough. Recipe was good, I just need more practice! :)

Good and simple to make.  I agree though that is is not fast.  I don't sweat the eggplant using salt, I pan fry it with a little bit of oil on both sides and then add about two tbsp of water to the pan so that it evaporates and then cover the pan.  Basically, I sweat it out in a different way.  This takes a shorter amount of time than the 20 minute salt sweat and is much easier.  Also I used seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs and did without the prosciutto.

This is the best eggplant rollitini. My husband and all my friends say its the best they ever had. I do change it a tiny bit. I add garlic seasoning to the egg and fresh minced garlic and parmesan to the ricotta, but that's just because I love garlic. Sometimes I switch it up and use ham instead of prosciutto or If I want to do it vegetarian style I dkip the meat and mix spinach with the ricotta. Every way is absolutely delicious. I always have to make a lot cuz everyone wants seconds or wants to take left overs home.

Great recipe! Used thinly sliced pancetta instead of prosciutto. I also used egg, parmesan, salt, peppper & garlic powder in my ricotta. My fiance loved it. Will definitely make again. I agree with other reviewers about sweating the eggplant. Wonderful meal to prepare on rainy Sunday.

When I made this, I added some ground hot sausage in with the ricotta cheese (mainly for my Husband, and because I had no prosciutto).  I also diced up the extra bits of eggplant that were not good for rolling and added them to the sauce.  I Loved how it turned out, and so did my Husband - I only had one rollatini and he gobbled it all up!!

The only reason why I didn’t give the recipe 5 Stars was because I seasoned the ricotta cheese with some onion and garlic powder with a pinch of freshly ground oregano, and I choose to bake the eggplant instead of frying it.  Other than that, this recipe is very delicious and very forgiving.  You can add into this recipe and it’ll still come out yummy.  My husband and kids truly enjoyed this version of eggplant.  I’ll definitely be a keeper in my recipe book.  Many thanks to the readers who shared their reviews and added some insight.

This was a great recipe. Instead of just ricotta, I actually made a mixture of ricotta, mozzarella, a little parmesan cheese and garlic powder and then spread that onto the eggplant. Delicious!

This was such an interesting dish. One thing I need to suggest to anyone who is willing to try something new, prosciutto is meant to be paper thin! Unique... probably worth a second shot, (with paper thin prosciutto!)

I LOVE this recipe! wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Well done! And thank you to the reviewers who mentioned 'sweating' the eggplant!!! Life saving comments! All this time I've been wondering why I have such a hard time making eggplant taste good. That's all I had to do

delicious! Used fat-free ricotta and spinach, mushroom, and garlic in the ricotta mixture. Broiled each eggplant slice under a broiler for 8 minutes on each side. Very good. Paired with tomato-cream sauce from this site and linguine.

Awesome! I agree with 3 of the major suggestions: (1) de-bitterize the eggplant for 30 minutes by putting salt generously and letting it drain out, (2) Ricotta Mix: Didn't use meat - sautead spinach and garlic and then mixed it in ricotta mix. I also spiced up the mix  - the spicier the better. I only had Frank's red hot but I would use Sriracha or chili peppers. (3) No need to fry the eggplant - just broil it 5-6 minutes each side when you put all the mix. This dish was AWESOME!

Quite a lot of effort for fairly minimal results, I will try as others suggested and do this as a flat bake next time rather then rolling (you put the same effort in to a Parmesan but yield more food..).  Also, ended up a bit too salty with the combination of prosciutto and bread crumbs (perhaps it was the brand of each but it was way too much).

So Simple and so Good.  My Husband, who is not a big Ricotta Cheese fan Loved it. Called it Restaurant Quality! WOW.  So needless to say this is a definite Repeat.

Great recipe! Added some italian spices, garlic powder, and parm cheese to the ricotta mixture and fried the eggplant in vegetable oil. Will definitely be making again.

Love this recipe!  I did change it just a little; I used the breading I keep on hand which is a combination of flour, panko bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. As always, I sweated the eggplant and added fresh basil on top of the ricotta.  Paired with  homemade linguine and a nice mixed salad, this was a wonderful meal.  I can't wait to try some of the variations mentioned in other reviews.  This one is a keeper!

Pretty good.  I didn't peel the eggplant but I did sweat it.   I also left out the prosciutto to keep it vegetarian.
It definitely took more than two tbsp. of olive oil to fry up the eggplant though.   I also served it over the veggie linguini instead of angel hair pasta.   Everyone loved it, including the 19 month old baby who couldn't get enough.   
My complaints are that it's "messy" in terms of dishes to clean up (dish for eggs and breadcrumbs, frying pan, baking dish and pasta pot), and it's pretty hard to get those slices at an even thickness.  Next time I'll use the mandolin.

DIVINE!! Few changes:  I baked the proscuitto until crispy and broke it over the top after it was baked.  Also, cutting the eggplant even and thin enough to roll was difficult so I just layered eggplant, ricotta mixture(I added fresh oregano, garlic, salt/pepper) eggplant, ricotta mix, eggplant (I doubled the recipe) then poured the jar of sauce and a can of italian diced tomatoes, then shredded cheese.  Baked about 45 min. Then crumbled proscuitto on top.  It was heavenly!!  Everyone loved it!  I made "Worlds Best Chocolate Cake" that has ricotta cheese in it and sour cream in the frosting.  The entire meal was divine!

My husband really liked this dish, but I didn't care for it. I sweated the eggplant as others suggested but just didn't care for the eggplant. We used a spinach/ricotta mixture for the filling but our eggplant slices weren't long enough to roll so I just layered the ingredients.

My family loved it!  I made a lower calorie version by baking my eggplant first rather than frying it.  I pre-heated my oven to 450 degrees and sprayed a baking sheet with a non-stick spray. I baked 12 minutes per side.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe.  Since I baked rather than fried my eggplant was firmer.  I had to fold rather than roll but the end results were the same.

My family loved these. I did broil the breaded eggplant on each side which was not as messy. Added a cup of frozen spinach, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of minced onion, and some chopped oregano and basil to the ricotta (had to have some more flavor). we didnt use the mozzarella only because i didnt have any. Just added some parmesan to the top. Im excited to try the same recipe using pounded chicken.

I was really looking forward to this dish. I made it without the prosciutto which is probably why I didn't think that it was great. Besides omitting the prosciutto, I made the recipe as it indicated and it was just too bland for me. As another reviewer stated... it was "quite a lot of effort for fairly minimal results". I wouldn't say fairly minimal though... more like "just OK" results. I think that I may have another go at it though and use some seasoning and parmesan cheese.

OMG - so very good.  I'm sure it is excellent made the way the recipe calls but I changed to accomodate my veggie husband.  Instead of frying I baked and sprinkled with EVOO.  Instead of pancetta I rolled two veggie meatballs in the middle.  They stayed together perfectly and the texture was perfect.  I also used 2% ricotta.  We bothed loved it.  HOMERUN RECIPE and better than Eggplant Parm!  Thank you!

I've made this recipe several times and love it. Like others, I sweated the eggplant, broiled instead of fried, and added spinach and garlic to the ricotta. This time I also added pesto, which I think was a great addition. I forgot to put in the salt and pepper in the ricotta like I usually do, and it was a noticeable difference. I'll remember it next time!

Delicious and fairly easy. The eggplant was softer then I anticipated after frying and was easy to roll. Have extra sauce on hand as the sauce in the pan wasn't quite enough for the pasta. Also, I used more than 1 c. of bread crumbs to coat the eggplant and more than 2 T. olive oil to pan fry the pieces. I will definately make this again!

Delicious -  An excellent use of eggplant from the garden.
I thought it was a fancier version of eggplant parmesan with the added bonus of prosciutto.   I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was very good, but the next time I will add a little garlic and fresh basil.

This recipe was delicious! I did change it a little...I just layed foil on the BBQ and cooked the eggplant that way instead of frying it. I used panko (seasoned with garlic powder, italian seasoning and s&p) instead of bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. (might try bread crumbs next time to see which is actually better) I used sauce made from my garden tomatoes (eggplant also was from the garden) and instead of angel hair pasta I used a small ziti cause I hate going to the grocery store when I have similar items in the house. The flavors were very complemetary, very good recipe.

No need to ever fry eggplant! Prepare as the recipe says except broil on each side for about 3 minutes instead of frying. Added some savory and pepper and garlic salt to the ricotta mix and laid some julienned zucchini on the ricotta instead of meat.

So good! I did sweat my eggplant for roughly an hour. I ended up cutting the slices too thick so instead I layered it in a 9x9. From bottom up, a little spag sauce, eggplant, ricotta,eggplant, ricotta, prosciutto,remaining eggplant, remaining spag sauce and all of the mozzarella. It was soo good, even my picky 8 year old loved it.

I was looking for low carb meatless main dishes for variety and stumbled across this recipe.  I did make some changes that made each serving 11.5 carbs each.  First I put salt on the eggplant pieces and let them sit on paper towels for about 20 minutes to reduce any chance of bitterness.  Instead of using the bread crumbs, I used 1/2 c ground pine nuts mixed with 1 c ground pork skins seasoned with basil and oregano.  I also used more oil than 2 T, probably more like 1/4 - 1/2 cup for the frying of the eggplant.  But this recipe was simply amazing even with these changes.  My husband loved it.  We ate it with spaghetti squash.

Excellent recipe for eggplant Rollatini.  I agree about sweating the eggplant.  Also - I think that the people who reviewed this recipe and were not happy with it or confused may not be familiar with "New York classic Italian" dishes.  This is pretty spot on to any Eggplant Rollatini that you order in an Italian Restaurant here in New York.  The Proscitto Ham...that is optional.

Delicious and easy recipe that I will certainly make again. With an addition of chopped spinach and granulated garlic to the ricotta filling, this recipe was so tasty, and the prosciutto complimented the flavors  so well.  I'm thinking maybe a fresh italian herb medley or roasted peppers with spicy sausage for the next round. The eggplant could have been sweated more; maybe salting eggplant slices and chilling on  papertowels for a few hours in the fridge will release more water so you have a firmer roll in the tomato sauce.

The eggplant rollatini was a success!  My husband said this is his new favorite meal.  I made some adjustments to the original recipe.  With the ricotta cheese, I added spinach, diced tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and peper then spreaded the mixer on the fried eggplant.  I excluded the prociutto.  This was a great recipe and I'm sure I will be making it again in the near future.

I am making this for the 2nd time this week because we loved it so much!  The only change I made was to sub bacon for the meat because that is what we had on hand.  It is soooooo good!

Instead of frying, I baked the eggplant slices after breading in a 375 oven until light brown. I was able to roll them right after they came out of the oven.  The kids had fun helping me make it!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I did have a hard time slicing the eggplant thin lenghtwise.  I do have a hand slicer, but could only slice it the short way.  I sliced it by hand, but did not slice thin enough, so I made the eggplant just like lasagna.  I did not fry as the recipe stated, but baked as other reviews stated--it was good--even better the second day.

This is a wonderful recipe. I use it as part of an Italian dinner without the pasta.  I make a marinari sauce instead of buying a spaghetti sauce. You can make the rollatinis in the morning and refrigerate them until ready to bake with the sauce and cheese. Also, make sure to "sweat" the eggplant to take out the bitterness.

This is really tasty.  I didn't use the proscuttio because I didn't have any and it was still awesome.  I recommend cutting the slices really thin, frying them until really golden and added just a very thin layer of riccota.  I wiil be making these again whenever I have eggplant.

First time really cooking with eggplant. This dish is really easy and soo delicious. I could never find that prosciutto so I had to use turkey bacon. I'm sure it's not as delicious as the original recipe, but it was so delicious. Next time, if I can find it, I will use the prosciutto.

I made the recipe just as is I did not have to do anything at all to the eggplant like some reviews are stating for example sweating the eggplant. This recipe can't get any easier!!! It was so delicious! I don't even like the taste of eggplant but I tried this anyway and it tasted great

I have never had eggplant, thought this was a good recipe.  I sweated it for about 45 mins and broiled it instead of frying.  Also added garlic, parmesan cheese and some fresh basil/parsley to the ricotta.   Will try this again.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for using non-fat ricotta) and it was delicious! My parents and fiancé both loved it. One thing - 14 ounces of sauce was a little light, next time I'll have more ready on standby for those who like more!

My 5 yr old son asked what an eggplant is and what it tastes like. I couldn't really tell him because I'd never had one. So we went to the store and he picked one out. I searched allrecipes for a popular recipe and came across this one. I was skeptical at first. I even prayed that it would turn out good. :) It was REALLY good. I didn't have any of that funky Italian meat so I used really thin sliced smoked ham. And I used panko bread crumbs instead of traditional bread crumbs (because I can get panko in natural). I also sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on right before the mozzarella. This was kinda time consuming, but totally worth it. My son even ate it!!

I found that this recipe did not clearly indicate that the eggplant should be thoroughly cooked during the frying process. I did have browned eggplant strips, but they were not cooked through. So, when I rolled the eggplant with the ricotta cheese and heated it for 15 to 20 minutes, I did not know that my eggplant was not cooked enough. I would recommend that one test their eggplant before rolling it to ensure it is thoroughly cooked. Otherwise great recipe!

This is one of my new favorite recipies... I used motzarella and home made ricotta cheeses since I can't get everything where we live overseas, but this just melted in my mouth.  My husband thought it was a nice dish, but he probably wouldn't request I make it again.  It also doesn't warm up very good the next day... it's okay, but not quite as good.

Great meal!  My wife and I had never had eggplant rollatini before so we didn't really know what to expect, but really what's not to like?  only suggestion would be to use more pasta sauce, or at least to save some for use on the angel hair, as it can be a bit dry otherwise.

I thought this was delicious!  An excellent way to use the eggplant from my CSA.  I added some basil, parmesan, and mozzarella to the ricotta mixture.  Having a mandoline really helps when cutting the eggplant.

This is one of our favorite recipes. It's great for a dinner party, you can make it ahead and throw it in the oven before guests arrive. It's even better than my Italian father-in-law's rollatini :)

Very good! I'd give it 5 stars if it had a few changes. I "sweated" out the eggplant. I chopped up Bordeaux spinach and mixed it in the ricotta cheese. I also mixed in Romano cheese and roasted garlic in the ricotta. Super easy to make and you can make so many changes to the filling. Next time I'm giving Italian sausage a go.

This is a good recipe but I did mix mozzerella,ricotta cheese,  an egg, garlic salt and parsley for the filling. And I added parmesean cheese to the bread crumbs. I made my own homemade sauce which is pretty easy to make. The sauce makes this dish really fabulous so choose a good sauce

Restaurant style! I got so many compliments on this dish I just had to rate it. I did nothing to change this recipe other than I used La Familia Marina Sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  I will be making this recipe for years to come. Thanks for sharing with us.

Have never had eggplant Rollatini before so don't know what it is supposed to taste like but LOVED this recipe.  Did not add prosciutto but did add spinach, nutmeg, abd basil to the ricotta cheese. Great flavor!!

This is pretty and tasty. I added garlic and parmesan to the ricotta (it definitely neeeds a personal touch). Although this was easy to make, it was kindof messy and took a little longer than expected. You can't step away from the eggplant while frying, or it will burn. I don't reccommend this for busy weeknights or if you have little "helpers", but it would be great for special dinners or company.

I am a beginner and my husband is my guinny pig and he loved this recipe. I bought an eggplant and wanted to do something different than just fry it. I substituted Italian bread crumbs for a mix of bread crumbs, parmesan and crushed parsley leaves. Since I could not find riccota cheese I mixed sour cream with a shredded italian mix cheese.
We will definitely make this one again!

This is a fantastic recipe! To make it a little lighter, I used part-skim mozzarella and ricotta.  Also, I like it just as much without the prosciutto as with it.  In some ways, I think the prosciutto over-powers the delicious taste of the eggplant.  Definitely and DEFINITELY delicious!

I am not an eggplant lover, but I will make this dish again & again!  My eggplant was too short to roll the slices, so I just made little eggplant "sandwiches" and baked them.  Had them on pasta & topped with sauce as suggested and they were fabulous.  Even my 6 yo and 4 yo asked for more...but their father had already cleaned out the pan. :o)

This is a good, handy recipe.  I'm trying to eat low carb and eggplant is a great substitute for lasagna noodles.  The only thing is you do need to add some salt to the eggplant slices to cut the bitterness.  I usually salt my eggplant and let them sit for a few minutes.  This draws out the extra liquid and helps with the flavor.  I'm a big eggplant fan and I love finding new ways to use this.  Thank you!

Gave this 4 stars only because of my adaptations. 
My family thought they weren't eggplant fans until now! 
To make this lighter, I sliced and sweated the eggplant, rinsed and dried the slices and laid each slice on a hot griddle that had been sprayed with cooking oil for 4 min/side. Skipped breading and frying and followed the rest as instructed. Served with Caesar salad. YUM!! All agreed: MAKE AGAIN!

This recipe was right on! You can tweek it here and there, but it's so solid on my first try. I did squeeze out some moisture of the slices before the eggwash. It was so good, I didn't want to share the leftovers with my coworkers. Made it along with some Roasted Chicken thighs, forget the pasta, Excellant.

I tried this recipe just the other day it came out great everybody loved it. I used hot ham instead of the prosciutto and 3 small leaves of basil from my garden and of course my Own  homemade sauce I thought this recipe was very easy to make. I had to sweat the eggplant for 3 hours because I just picked  it from my garden I'm glad I did it had a lot of water. Liked t so much I'm making it again this week with some left over sauce.

Delicious!  Made it on the fly without time to run to grocery store, so substituted pepperoni slices for the filler.  YUM! Whole family loved it, even the toddlers.

This recipe is pretty great! The only thing, is that I made my own sauce, rather than using spaghetti sauce in a jar. It has a much better taste on the eggplant AND pasta, rather than tasting synthetic. Another thing, I allowed the eggplant slices to sweat out.

Instead of ricotta cheese I used cottage cheese and omitted the prosciutto.  I added spinach, garlic and basil to the mixture.

This is a nice recipe.  I was able to cook three slices of eggplant in a 12" skillet.  The first batch of eggplant slices was cold by the time the last slices were cooked.  Hmm, what to do?  I suggest baking the eggplant rolls in a covered dish at 350° for 30-40 minutes.  Then add pasta, more red sauce, and mozzarella cheese before baking it uncovered for 15 minutes.  Wrapping Italian sausage, pepperoni, spinach, or whatever, inside can vary this recipe into some nice dishes.

This recipe was amazing!!  I added chopped fresh garlic and sauteed spinach(chopped to the ricotta and some parm cheese)  I sweated the eggplant and probably won't do that again....some of the salt didn't wash off and I did not see the difference in tase between sweated and non.  I also didn't use the ham.  It turned out so good, but boy was this time consuming!  it says 45 minutes....try more like 3 hours with soaking, slicing, frying, chopping, cooking the sauce and then rolling it up, and then clean up.

This is a great recipe.  Our modification utilized our homegrown smaller Japanese eggplants, making it a bit more intense in the prep arena.  Because of this, we made it into a layered lasagne style casserole which turned out to be marvelous.

This was very good.  I sweated the eggplant as was suggested by others.  I used ham instead of proscuitto.  I also seasoned the ricotta with some garlic and italian seasoning.  Will make this again.

I've made this twice, and I just realised that the second time I left out the breadcrumb bit, but it turned out great anyway!  I added grated pecorino and, like many others, spinach to the ricotta.  I poured over tomato passata (puree) to which I added salt, dried oregano and minced garlic, and that seemed to be enough.  I think not crumbing them might make the process a little quicker and less messy, I just sliced and lighty fried the eggplant in a griddle pan.  I'm happy with them either way, and so was everyone else that ate them (incl my bro-in-law who didn't want any but after having one decided that he was taking any left-overs home with him so he could take them to work for lunch the next day)!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe but wasn't too happy with the fatty part of the prosciutto.  Maybe cut this part off first or use high grade of ham?  Overall, was great!  Will make again.  Also, I added spinach to the ricotta cheese, and topped it off with parm/romano cheese.  Many thanks!

Never had Eggplant Rollatini before and I was very impressed! Was even better the day after. I served over linguini. Perfect for company, looks like you slaved over the stove all day!

Excellent.  We love to get Eggplant Rollatini at our favorite Italian restaurant, but this is the first time I've tried making it at home. I was thinking of freezing it before baking.

This recipe was SO GOOD!  I didn't know what proscuitto was (I thought it was a cheese) so I used swiss inside the eggplant and it was great!  I will try the meat slices next time though!

I've made this twice now and we've loved both times. I cut back a little bit on the mozzarella. I also added a little pesto to the ricotta cheese. My family loved this.

I wanted this to be better. It looked and smelled so good in preparation, but was rather hard to chew in its finished state. The flavor of the eggplant was more pronounced than I imagined it would be.

This was easy to make and DELICIOUS.   Kind of like eggplant parm with a twist.   I served it with a small side of spaghetti.   Will definitely make this again.

I bake the breaded eggplant rather than fry it; less mess and just as tasty. My family loved this recipe with my homemade arrabiata red gravy.

Only modifications were adding fresh basil to the ricotta and I sweat the eggplant for about an hour...perfection! Did end up taking about 2 hours including sweating the eggplant, but totally worth it!

This was really good.  I sweated the eggplant and breaded it then cooked it in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I rolled it with ricotta cheese and left-over steamed rice, covered it with left-over chili with beans topped with mozarella cheese and baked as per recipe.  It was so good!  Even my husband, who hates eggplant, ate it all.

Added tons to the ricotta mixture for taste, left out the prosciutto for a "meatless" dinner.  Sliced my eggplant on my mandolin, I think I will slice thinner than 1/4 inch next time.

I added spinach and nutmeg, garlic and pepper to the ricotta cheese.  My husband and I love this recipe.  He eats eggplant because it is healthy but he said he loved eggplant prepared this way.  There is some prep time involved, but it is definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

needs work!  Cook much longer than the writer's recipe.  Suggest 25 min plus in oven.  Be prepared to use much more oil than recipe indicates.

What's not to love? I made my own sauce (can of San Marzano whole tomatoes, sauteed some onion and garlic in a little EVOO, added the tomatoes, salt, pepper, splash of red wine and a bunch of frozen basil that I had in the freezer from my garden). I was out of proscuitto, but I had a block of ham that I shaved very thin, and subbed that instead. One thing to note though, I needed 2 eggs - probably could have used 3, as well as close to 2 cups of bread crumbs to coat 1 eggplant (sliced in 1/4 sliced with my mandoline). I added a bit of Pecorino Romano cheese to the bread crumbs as well,  as I usually do when using Italian bread crumbs. Very tasty dinner, and one that I will make again!

I sweat the eggplant for 30 min then rinsed. Instead of frying, I baked it for 10 min (turning halfway). I used thinly sliced spiral cut ham in place of the proscuitto. I also did what a reviewer mentioned, and it was easy....just layered  everything.... eggplant, ricotta, ham that I used, then sprinkled with garlic powder & pepper, sauce and mozzarella. Baked at 350degF for 20 min. Thanks - came out perfect!

This came out great but it is labor intensive. I made it as written however the next time I make it I will add garlic and Italian seasonings to the eggplant itself to give it more flavor and I will also add to ricotta. I always sweat the eggplant to get rid of the bitter taste. Not a step worth skipping as it makes a difference in the taste. I always leave on the skin for the texture and the look.   A great recipe I will be making again!

This is a very good (...and simple) recipe, which I very much appreciated. Quick and easy to follow.  However....as is the case with so many Italian recipes,,,,don't mislead yourself.  I think you will find  a need for more oil working with eggplant, and more egg batter.  Also, try dredging the sliced eggplant in flour before dipping in the egg.  And, I have found that you can decrease the usual frying mess, if you bake the sliced eggplant on an oiled cook sheet .

A very tasty and great new way to serve eggplant at our house. I sweat the eggplant first and baked it rather than fry it to save a few calories.  I also used low fat ricotta.  I will make this again.

This was AMAZING! Sweating the eggplant was not necessary. It was rather easy to assemble. I made this recipe as recommended, as as a few other reviewers advised, I added spinach and chopped garlic to the ricotta cheese. I cooked it without a layer of foil in the oven too. It was just the perfect meshing of all the different flavors. The rolls were moist, the prosciutto, although I'm not a fan of it, really added much flavor to this dish. We cleaned this 9x13" dish of food in two days flat. I will be adding this to the list of family favorites. Thanks so much for the recipe, and the critical reviews.

I did not have the spaghetti sauce so used a 8oz can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomato instead. Just added a little salt/pepper and garlic to the sauce. Very good!

Well I did it! This recipe was Fab! I agree with others that it takes a bit longer...a bit more oil to fry eggplant. But worth the time. The flavors meld together perfectly. I did add a little more spices like garlic powder and parsley due to others saying it was bland but otherwise followed the recipe. Very yummy indeed, even my husband loved it. Surprise surprise!

My family loves this dish.  We don't care for prosciutto so I substituted with thinly sliced ham.  Imo the dish is to good for store bought sauce (and I never use it)  I made a triple batch of "Best Marinara Sauce" that uses stewed tomatoes, it's excellent.

I have made this dish twice.  The second time I used partially cooked bacon and it gave the dish a different flavor...yum!

WONDERFUL recipe for Eggplant fans! Easy to make. YUMMMMM!
I omitted the prosciutto & added Italian seasoning to my ricotta. 
* Also boiled the eggplant for a couple of minutes first (because that's supposed to get rid of any bitter flavor. Had to pat it dry then dip in beaten egg.
The suggestion of adding spinach sounds great, so next time I will try it that way.

Two of us liked it, two didn't.  I tripled it because this is a lot of effort for one egg plant.  Didn't make the pasta since I didn't have a lot of sauce.  I'd give this 5 stars if the house wasn't split on this.

Very Good. I added some parmigiano regiano to the bread crumbs.  Next time I will use a sausage or ground beef mixture instead of the prosciutto. It was very good with the prosciutto I will probably add some roasted red peppers next time as well.  Served with rice balls instead of a pasta, great filling dinner.

I baked the breaded eggplant instead of frying it.  I thought the rolled eggplant could fit in a smaller baking dish (8x8 instead of 13x9) not sure if that would affect the way it cooks at all.  Overall, I enjoyed it and would make it again!
