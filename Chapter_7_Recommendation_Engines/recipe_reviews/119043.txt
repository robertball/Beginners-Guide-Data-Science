This was fantastic!  I skipped the butter and drizzled olive oil instead.  I also skipped the cheddar and subbed a handful of mozzarela.  Perfect to dip in soup!  Will make often.

This stuff is great!  I decided to make this as a side to "Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs" from this site instead of traditional garlic bread...just to make something a little different.  It was sooooo good!  I will certainly make this again...as a snack, as a side, as an appie...you name it!  We loved it!

An easy and delicious recipe.  I did not have Romano cheese or fresh basil but it still tasted great.  I I will be making this alot in the future.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. I did not care for the refrigerated pizza dough taste with this recipe. I think it might be better for me with frozen bread dough. But, if you really like the refrigerated pizza dough, you will probably like it!

I liked the toppings on it, but I'm not thrilled with the crust. I really like the idea of it, I'm just going to have to experiment with different crusts.

Good! My only complaint is that it was a little greasy, but that could very well have been the brand of pizza dough I used. I'll make this again next time I have leftover homemade pizza dough. This was a nice change from the usual garlic bread. Thanks! :)

A easy way to make a Italian starter or snack. This recipe would be ideal for parties, special occasion. It would go a long way with the kids.

I used my pizza dough (jay's signature) from this site, and these turned out great.  I rolled mine into a rectangle, cut in in half lengthwise and then in 1" strips, and then pre-baked for 5 min.  I used mozzarella and parm in order to make them like the cheese sticks at our local pizza place and cooked them for 6 minutes more.  Great with marinara sauce!

This was good but I think next time I will use cresent rolls/dough to make it flaky as I felt the pizza dough I use was flat. Other than that, it was pretty good.

Really Good I think I used a little extra cheese than recipe calls for, but that was all personal preference.

Delicious, and very easy! I didn't use the parmesean cheese because I didn't have any, but otherwise I followed the recipe.

So easy to make.  This was a perfect bread to go with our baked pasta dish for dinner.  Would also be great as an appetizer with marinara sauce for dipping.

I didn't have pizza dough but I did have a loaf of Chiabatta bread.  I sliced it in half, opened it like a book and proceeded with the recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for the bread, and it is now a family and company favorite.  Wonderful!

Tasty and easy to make. I found it a little too greasy, even though I only used half the butter called for in the recipe. If I make it again I will omit the butter completely.

Domino's cheesy bread is my favorite- this bread is similar, but something's missing- going to try adding 1/2 tsp onion powder & 1/4 tsp oregano...

This was easy and turned out good! I used olive oil instead of butter, and also used oregano along with the basil. Used a lot more cheese than recipe called for ;)

This is really good but I think we prefer this garlic mixture on white Italian bread under the broiler. Either way, it's really good.

I found it to be very greasy once cooked. Kids loved helping prepare it though so I will try it again but with half the butter!

Love it.  Will never use the frozen garlic bread again. Used mozzarella cheese and cut back on cheddar. Used dried basil since that was what I had. Still sooo tasty.  I would have been happy eating just the bread and forgetting my lasagna.

This was absolutely fantastic.  The whole tray disappeared in seconds!  It was an instant hit with everyone and they begged for more. However I did make it using my pizza dough recipe rather than the store purchased dough.  But I'm sure it's just as good using the pre-prepared dough. The other thing that makes this great is that it goes with anything, but can also stand alone as a tasty appetizer.  It was also sooooo easy to make.  Thanks Tom!

Quick, easy and tasty, always a good combination.  Daughter was four days removed from having wisdom teeth cut out, so I folded over the pizza dough for less crispy, more fluffy.
