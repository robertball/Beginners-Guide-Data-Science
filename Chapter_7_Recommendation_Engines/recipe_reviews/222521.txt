This is the original recipe described in Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide (Revised, c. 1972).  The 17-year J. Wray Nephew rum has not been available for decades.  For a substitute, visit my profile to see my Mai Tai Rum Blend recipe.  I agree with The Lobster Lady: use Fee Brothers Ogeat for any cocktail calling for this ingredient.  Do garnish with the spent lime shell - the oils from the lime skin add to the drink.

I made this with Captain Morganâ€™s Black Spiced Rum since it was on hand and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper and I can wait to try it out on friends.

Well done.  Could not find French Garnier Orgeat, but I will be on the lookout.  Thanks for a proper Mai Tai recipe.
