These are great and will be super cute on the Christmas dessert tray.  I have frozen them in hopes that they make out just as well as butter tarts do frozen, don't see why not.  I made them in little muffin/tart cups and they come right out of the paper.  To drizzle the chocolate I used a Ziplock bag and cut a tiny hole in the bottom.  Worked really well.  I only used about 1/2 the chocolate though, so you can likely cut down on the melted chocolate if only drizzling.

HEAVENLY!! Made these so much during the holidays that I had the recipe memorized. Made the crust ahead of time and let "set" before molding into the muffin tins. Don't fill nearly as much next time - these puff up/overflow and don't look as nice. Err on the side of underfilling. Topped with confectioners sugar once cooled. This was great for a holiday party, as well as a football tailgate!

These tiny pies are absolutely tasty!  You don't even need to grease the mini muffin pans.  And, I did a test, I only put the melted chocolate on two of the little pies and it wasn't nearly as good as the ones without the chocolate.  You don't need chocolate on these, it takes away from the pecan pie taste.

These are very very good--surprisingly so.  The crust is super flaky ans delish!  I only had a half cup of pecans and it was fine.  I also left off the chocolate drizzle...didn't need it!  I would suggest getting a mini tart shaper--the hardest part was forming the crust in each mini muffin cup.
