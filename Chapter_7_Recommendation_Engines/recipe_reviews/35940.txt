Very simple like the recipe says, but I could have saved time peeling the pears and just used canned pears. It's not going to be that recipe that makes everyone say "WOW! How did you do this?"

The first time I made this it was good---didn't look that nice as the chocolate was rather 'gloppy' on the pears, but my family of men didn't notice.  However, the second time...well... WHAT HAPPENED? I don't know.  The chocolate didn't stick to the pears at all... it was a mess.  (Very sad...) I won't venture into this territory again.

I made this for my parents when they visited me recently.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of squares, but next time I think I'll try milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  My parents loved it, but I thought it was just okay.

okay not satisfying as a dessert.  Perhaps a snack midday that is a bit sweeter than fruit.
