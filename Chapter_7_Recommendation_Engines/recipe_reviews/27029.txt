These turned out perfect. I had never done candied anything before and most of the recipes I found for nuts seemed like they would take forever and turn out like brittle or something. 
After I turned them out onto the parchment paper I scattered them so they wouldn't stick. After about ten minutes they were dry and not sticky to the touch (something I was worried about) They tasted so yummy. 

I also found that toasting them for about 5-10 minutes (watching so they dont burn!!) in the oven at 400 f. brought out the flavor or the nuts. Do this step before candying them.

Excellent recipe. I made a few changes to make it lower in carbs. Used 1/3 C. Splenda and added a handful of brown sugar, added 1 t. chili powder, omitted the nutmeg (added a shake of cloves instead); upped cinnamon to 1 1/2 t. Mixed in almonds and salted cashews. YUMMY! I was worried that the Splenda would give an after taste, but it didn't.

These are excellent and so easy.  I toasted walnuts in the oven for a few minutes to make sure they were nice and crunchy.  Also added a bit of cayenne to the butter mix to give a subtle bite.  Added a light sprinkling of salt after the nuts were resting on the paper.  Delicious!  I'm packaging these for the family this year instead of all those Christmas cookies.

I've made about six batches of these this year already and am getting ready to make another - they're wonderful!  I start w/ pre-toasted nuts (using walnuts 'cause they're the cheapest) which I buy in bulk.  When they come out of the microwave I spread them out and immediately sprinkle them lightly with kosher salt.  Absolutely delicious!  Also, when I buy nuts of any kind I always toast them as soon as I get home, put them into storage containers (zip type baggies) and keep them in the freezer.  Nuts keep forever that way and are so much better when toasted.

Wow!!! Very easy and a sure-fire pleaser.  Works great as a last minute Christmas gift, snack for company, or...for yourself!  Great flavor.  Work good with other types of nuts, too.  I used a couple cans of mixed nuts and they were just as good.  Thanks, Jim!

These are great!  I made them for holiday gifts for the neighbors.  I increased the amount of cinnamon, roasted the pecans at 400 for about 7 minutes before starting and then sprinkled with kosher salt afterwards.  They turned out really good!  And SO easy!!

Very good. I used cinnamon, allspice, ginger and a sprinkle of kosher salt to bring out the flavor. I agree with other reviewers that its good to add some extra cinnamon, etc. I think the could have turned out crisper if not prepared in the microwave, but the microwave sure makes it easy. Perhaps I will try pre-toasting the nuts next time.

This was super easy and tastes really good!  The only things I added was 1/4 tsp. of salt to bring out the flavor, and as previously noted, I did toast the nuts at 400F for about 7 minutes.  I'll be giving this away for Christmas Gifts!  MMMMMMM!

2009: PHENOMENAL!!! I substituted  orange juice for the water, and 1/2 t Chinese 5 spice powder for 1/2 t cinnamon.  I had enough caramel sauce to coat 16 oz (4 cups) of walnuts.  The cooking time totaled 5 minutes, and I cooled the nuts on a cookie sheet that I'd sprayed w/ butter-flavor Pam.  The nuts were soft while they were hot, but crisped up after they cooled, tho the caramel stayed slightly sticky.  DH tasted and thought they needed "something" so I sprinkled the cooled nuts w/ a few good pinches of salt, and that seemed to do the trick.  I just packed them back into the original Diamond walnut container (after I covered it in wrapping paper and added ricrac to the lid!).  This is a new holiday favorite!  2010: Gave these to a friend who was heading out on the road (apparently they didn't last past the state line...), and to coworkers for Christmas gifts, to RAVE reviews.  2011: One of the guys to whom I gave these last Christmas used his to make baked French toast for their family's Christmas breakfast. I haven't seen him in months, but I got a call from him shortly before this Christmas, asking for this recipe, as his newly pregnant daughter-in-law was asking for his baked French toast with the spiced nuts in it like he'd made last year! 2013: Made these for coworkers for Super Bowl snacks, to the usual rave reviews; used walnuts, pecans and almonds, changed up the spices...I will NEVER tire of this recipe!

I just made these and have them cooling now. They are Wonderful!! Made them hoping they would turn out so I could give to co-workers and I really think they will be a hit! The easiest recipe I have ever made Can't believe they turn out in the microwave!! I am sure all microwaves are different but I stoped cooking at 4.5 minutes to be on the safe side with mine and they turned out perfect! Thanks

These were good, though I thought could be more spicy, and my preference is for the toasty crispiness you can get from an oven, but not the microwave.  Would be a nice snack-in-a-hurry.  They are very quick to make, and are dry and cool enough to eat in a few minutes.

Great - we love these nuts!  I increased cinnamon to 1.5 t and added 1/4 t salt.  I toasted the nuts ahead of time as suggested by others then microwaved for 4 minutes stirring every 30 seconds.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

Just made these, they turned out awsome, I did add a bit of salt and then I see one other reviewer did the same, i just like the sweet, salty it gives them. I did a cup each of pecans, walnuts, and toased almonds... I thought for christmas the variety was nice.

We were craving a snack and since I had some pecans in the freezer I decided to try this recipe! I made a few additions/changes. Since my nuts were frozen I toasted them in the microwave until they were crispy. You can do that in the oven if you prefer but I use my microwave for it all the time. You just have to stir them every couple minutes or so. I used 2 tsp cinnamon since many reviews suggested to use more and I love it. I also added about 1/4 tsp Allspice, a bit of sea salt and a couple shakes of the red pepper. The end result is super yummy!

Tastes great using 1/4 c. Splenda brown sugar instead of brown sugar, too. Great taste, great ease, and great compliments. Thanks for sharing!

These are great!  Pre-toasted the nuts as recommended by others.  Used 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Microwaved for 4 1/2 minutes.  I used walnuts, but I think it's a solid recipe for use with whatever nuts you have on hand.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I scaled mine for 1 cup of nuts and added a pinch of cayenne.  I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of nuts but still perfect.  Used them in a pear and goat cheese salad with lemon viniagrette.  Huge hit in salad or plain!

Great recipe!  I too prefer the nuts to be a little crisper (oven-toasted), but you can't beat the ease of this recipe.  The batch I made was eaten up in no time that same day!  Thanks for sharing Mom's recipe.

I give it 5 stars due to the ease of this recipe.   I have made several batches on these spiced nuts and I always try something a little different with each batch.  I slightly toast the nuts before adding to the mixture.  I also followed other advice by added a couple of sprinkles of cayenne pepper and have salted the nuts after coming out of the microwave.  I have also added in a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batch.  My family loves these!

They're pretty good! They make great gifts for coworkers and friends. Make sure you watch your batch closely because they burn easily. 50 sec at a time in the microwave was perfect for me.

Yummy!  I quartered this recipe, as I just needed a few spiced nuts to add to a salad.  I microwaved them in 30-second increments for 2.5 minutes. Easy and good.  I'll add more of each of the spices next time.

I usually roast and candy nuts in the oven, but was short on time today. First batch, I wasn't paying attention and put the nuts in for 5 minutes without stopping to stir them. They burned, as you can imagine. Second batch I remembered to stir, and they came out great! So, remember to stir the nuts!!

I reduced the recipe to make just enough to use as a topping for a salad.  
2T Sugar
1T butter
1/2 t water
1/2 spice (next time I will use more, but it was still tasty as is)
3/4 cups nuts.
But I found it burned on top if I tried to cook on high for any more than a minute.  I would stir it every 30 seconds when making the smaller portion.
And a hint.  Push the nuts up against the side of the bowl so there is a cavity in the middle of the bowl and it will heat more evenly.

Soooooo easy and really good.  I followed the ingredient list and method exactly with the exception of using a mixture of different kinds of roasted and salted nuts.  These were very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I used some of the other suggestions combined: pre-toasted nuts  for 7-8 min (I used unsalted almonds and cashews), omitted nutmeg and used a pinch of ground cloves instead and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne powder. I also increased the quantity of nuts to 6 cups and found there was enough mixture to cover another cup or so, so might do 7 cups next time. Delicious!

WOW!!!  This is so much easier than trying to do them in the oven.  I had the family over and they were all gone.  I did decrease the water to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons and used 1/2 tablespoon vanilla.

This is amazing. I used fresh nutmeg (grated the nut). It tasted like pumpkin pie in every bite.
My husband loves coconut so I made another batch with coconut. I put approx. 1\2 cup of coconut in food processor and grated so not so long. If I had coconut extract I would have added to the egg white. Mixed sugar with coconut and followed recipe. Very good, next time I will add a bit of cocoa, then it will taste like mounds bar...

I just made a double batch of these nuts and they are delicious.  I used almonds, pecans and salted cashews.  I toasted the almonds  and pecans as suggested by other reviewers.  I hope these make it to the containers! And just as easy as everyone else has said.

Oh, yum!  Made these out of toasted pecans and walnuts using Brown Sugar Splenda blend before I went on a girl's weekend.  They were a hit and we couldn't stop eating them.  I did add a generous dash of cayenne, and that was a good addition.  I especially appreciated a 'no salt added' option for fancy nuts.  Would make a great gift.  If they are in your kitchen, you will just keep eating them!

Be careful, if you make them you will eat them.  They are so good, I made them as directed, wouldn't change a thing.  Used walnuts and pecans, roasted, had almonds but forgot...next time, there will be a next time.  Maybe today!

Excellent. I only made three tweaks. I had a jar of unsalted roasted peanuts, and the hubby will not eat unsalted. So, I decided to try this recipe to use those up. I added about 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper, cooked in the mic. as written, but sprinkled with a little kosher salt after I spread them on the parchment while they were still hot. Delish. Will do this one again.

This are very good and so simple. I've made them twice now. The first time was as written. The second time i toasted the nuts first, left out the nutmeg, upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp salt. That made them just the way we like them. Oh, and discovered that if you over cook them (that was 5 minutes in my microwave) they turn out more like a hard glaze then sugared.

I made this recipe the other night. Very quick. simple and delicious!  I definitely recommend roasting the nuts in the oven per previous reviews for 8 or so minutes and doubling the cinnamon. I forgot to add cayenne pepper, but bet that would've indeed given it a very nice kick...will definitely add next time.

Made these for a Dad's day party today and of course I had to take a taste. Yum! I used the oven method to make them crispier, doubled the cinnamon and added a touch of cayenne for some zippity-do-da. Nothing like a couple of spicey nuts to get you going. Thanks Jim!!

I'm always looking for recipes that add more nuts and cinnamon to our diet since both are very nutritious.  This recipe is a keeper!  Don't just use it during the holidays.  These tasty morsels are great to have around all year long!  I did use just a tad less butter and sugar, and doubled the cinnamon.  Wonderful and so very quick!

I used all Penzey’s Spices and the ground nutmeg was opened just for this (coincidentally).
Vietnamese Cinnamon.
And added 1/2 teaspoon RECENTLY opened ground ginger.

This is so good - every time I make it it disappears quickly!  Because I have family members who can't eat sugar, I substitute Stevia for the brown sugar (1/2 cup).   I use walnuts, pecans, and cashews - a yummy combination.

Quick, easy, delicious and gone.  I thought all the proportions were right for my taste.  I used walnuts, pecans, and almonds.  I also "finished" it in the oven for 12 minutes at 350dF.  Love it.

Excellent and super easy! If you decide to toast the pecans prior to microwaving, I suggest 3 minutes. Really easy to burn on a cookie sheet.

I changed nothing. They were fast and easy to make and I always have those ingredients on hand.
However, the texture left a little to be desired. They weren't crispy like they are when made in an oven but I guess that is the trade-off for making them so speedily. Everyone seemed to enjoy them. I will probably make them again.

Was warned by hubby to remove these from sight or he couldn't make any guarantees there would be any left. I didn't have enough pecans so added some walnuts, peanuts & sliced almonds to make enough for a batch. Will make these again, but can't to often for my hubbies sake.

These turned out great and everyone at the party wanted the recipe.  I added  1/8 tsp Cayenne to spice it up a bit.

Well so far so good!  I will never overly scrutinize ANYTHING this nice enough looking and tasting that is prepared in the microwave!!! Found walnuts on sale at a VERY GOOD PRICE which helped render my decision to spice them up for Christmas gifts!  Doubled my 1st batch and plan to cool and repeat, and repeat a time or ten??. BTW, snagged one while scattering to cool-WOW!

Love this!! I threw a small party (12 people) and needed something for all of us to snack on and my pantry was practically empty. I made this (substituted canola oil for the butter due to my empty pantry & fridge). It was a hit!

Mine did not turn out well, which is probably b/c of the cook, not the recipe.  The nuts were chewy and sticky.  I didn't use real butter - so that could have been the problem?  Def. easy to prepare, may try again around the holidays.

I made a batch of these, and I personally thought they were just okay. But I gave most of them to The Woman I Love, and she loved them (she said she'd give them a 5-star rating herself). A friend of hers also tried some and she liked them too.
For the record, I used unsalted butter, and I cooked the nuts for a total of 5 minutes. Maybe this turned out wrong for me, but I was expecting a glazed or candy-coated nut, and these were more sugar-coated. They were okay, but I won't make them again for myself.

Love the ease of this recipe! 
Made a half batch using whole almonds (which I toasted ahead of time) and 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/8 tsp cayenne for the seasoning.  Came out pretty well.  There was extra glaze that I should have tried to leave in the bottom of the dish instead of pouring it all out onto the parchment paper, but I separated the nuts and it was o.k. Some of the nuts had a thicker coating of the glaze than others, and that glaze doesn't harden completely (it get's caramel-like).  I'll definitely use this recipe again, but will tinker with the seasonings to give the nuts more of a flavor kick.

These were ok.  I made these at the same time I made the sugar coated pecans from this site.  These were done first and I liked them but once the others were done, they were super Yummy while these microwave ones were just ok.  Guests thought the same way.

This recipe is very easy and delicious. I made three batches and took other reviewer's advice and added cayenne pepper. Each batch got progressively spicy. These are supposed to be Christmas gifts but I'm not sure I can keep my husband out of them! Thanks for the recipe.

Thank goodness this is an easy recipe!!  I made one batch, for guests, and they were gone in no time.  Not only did I have to make more...I also had to print out several copies of the recipe!  This one is a keeper!

Not very good.  Not enough flavor.  Not enough to cover and stick to the nuts.  Also the nuts were soggy, not crisp.  Won't make again.

the best thing that i can say about this recipe is that it is a quick fix to a craving.  i was a little disappointed with the flavor; i wanted them a little sweeter.  i used curry, cayenne, and ginger, so maybe i just need to add a little more sugar next time.  the easiness of this recipe will encourage me to keep trying.

This is a great recipe.  I really liked it.  I did pre-toast the nuts and I added ground ginger.  I will probably modify it a bit next time too, as I taste more nut than spice, and I REALLY want the spice!  :-)  Thanks for a great recipe.

My mistake in choosing this recipe was that I was
expecting sugared nuts as opposed to glazed nuts.
It's still a tasty recipe. With my microwave, the recipe required more cooking time. My glaze didn't set up very well.

This was quick, easy, and yummy!  I needed a quick Easter gift for my daughter's nursery school teachers.  I made this nut mix, combined it with pastel malted milk Easter egg candies, and packaged it in pretty cellophane bags with ribbons.  Great!

My family loves these! I use sucanat instead of brown sugar, and I found the coating was enough for 4 cups of nuts. It did take a little longer in the microwave, but I guess that would be dependent on how powerful your microwave is.

I was really excited to find a spiced nut recipe that you didn't have to cook on the stove, but this one burned in our microwave! :(  I was very sad...I don't know if our microwave voltage is too high or what I did wrong.  I was kind of dissapointed.
