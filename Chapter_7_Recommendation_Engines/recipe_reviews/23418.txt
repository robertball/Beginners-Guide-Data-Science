This recipe is a jewel of a recipe--I've made them twice now using nectarines only. It's like eating a muffin with peach preserves on it, only better. I made some minor adjustments after reading previous reviews: My medium sized nectarines were a little tart & not ripe enough, so I made a chunky puree in my food processor then adjusted the milk to 2 or 3 tablespoons instead of 1/3 cup--I would recommend not adding the milk until you see how liquid the batter is after adding your fruit. Additional ingredients: another 1/4 cup brown sugar for a sweeter muffin, which I prefer, 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg, 1 T vanilla. Also mix just until ingredients are moistened, don't overmix. I made 12 muffins, added a streusel topping of brown sugar, flour, butter & a sprinkle of cinnamon the first time, then just the sprinkle of brown sugar the 2nd time--it really only needs the brown sugar sprinkle. These would also be good with fresh summer peaches, but liquid content would need adjustment. Thanks Elizabeth, these are excellent!

This is an excellent recipe once a few adjustments have been made.  I used some of the previous suggestions and added a couple of my own.  Instead of 3/4 c. white sugar, I used 1/2 c. white and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  I added 1 t. vanilla, 1 generous t. cinnamon and 3/4 t. nutmeg.  I baked them in mini muffin cups for 13 minutes in the highest oven rack.  It made 34 minis.  Very moist and very peachy.  I only had peaches so I used 3 medium peaches.

These muffins are absolutely delightful!  I used all (very ripe) nectarines (no peaches),and added a touch each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla, which really brought out the fruit flavor.  The brown sugar topping has a wonderful crunch when the muffins are just out of the oven.  They taste just as good after being frozen as they are fresh.  I suggest doubling the recipe (which I did), because you will definitely want more of these treats. This is a perfect way to use those extra ripe peaches and nectarines!

I doubled recipe and used 2 peaches and added 1 tsp vanilla.  TIP: Drop peaches in pot of boiling water and skin can easily be removed.  I topped with brown sugar and walnuts.  YUMMY!

These are excellent.  I've read a few of the reviews that said the muffins were bland.  POPPYCOCK!  I believe those reviewers used peaches that had a low sugar content or were not sufficiently ripe.  Made with good peaches and nectarines, I could eat these muffins every day for the rest of my life.

I really enjoyed these muffins.  I used 5 small nectarines as I had no peaches. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon in the dry ingredients. Two other people tried the muffins and really enjoyed them as well!

These muffins are delicous!To make them healthier I used applesauce instead of butter and 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg.
I will make these again!!!

The muffins were very light, but did not have an intense peach-nectarine flavor. Very bland. I also think that I might have added too much of the nectarine-peach combo. The muffins were *too* moist for me. One nectarine and one peach yielded 3 cups of fruit for me. It would be helpful to have measurements for the fruit, because sizes and amounts will vary. Thanks for the opportunity to have tried something new, but I will not be making this again.

We really enjoyed these, a truly summery muffin recipe. I made some changes following others' suggestions, though: Used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, substituted half the vegetable oil with apple sauce to lower the fat, and added two teaspoons of freshly grated ginger (I love the combination of ginger and peach)... Awesome. I think the original recipe would have been a little too plain for me as well.

Yummy!  I used about 1 cup of diced nectarines, applesauce instead of oil, added cinnamon and vanilla, and used half whole wheat/half all-purpose flour!  They turned out great, except they stuck to the muffin wrappers a little.

Del-icious! Everyone loved these! Next time I make them I am going to sprinkle sugar in the raw on top instead of brown sugar! The difference in texture will add to the fantasticness of the recipe!

These muffins are fabulous!  I followed Grannyloohoo's sage baking advice and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I also used ¾ cup all purpose flour and ¾ cup King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour and they were moist and perfect.  I cut my nectarines and peaches into a large dice and I loved biting into the fruit.  I had some streusel topping, oatmeal, flour, butter and cinnamon, left from something else I had made so I topped them with that.  Following the submitter’s directions and filling my muffin cups to the top yielded 8 beautiful, good sized muffins.  YUM!

Absolutely wonderful! they came out fluffy and not overly sweet. The whole house loved them including a fussy 2 year old who refuses to eat any other fruit than banana. The only change I made was to add a tea. of vanilla. I think this recipe would work well with blueberries or strawberries as well, I look forward to trying it out. Thanks for a great recipe, I'd give ten stars if I could!

Great recipe! I just moved to the South Okanagan in BC, where fresh fruit is plentiful. Found myself with a box of nectarines needing to be used. Unfortunately my muffin pans are packed somewhere - so I made a loaf instead. I used 6 small nectarines, threw them into a food processor until it was a slightly chunky slop. As suggested in another review, I waited until the fruit was mixed with the flour mix before I added milk - good thing, because I didn't really need any added liquid. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla. Took about 50 minutes to cook and it turned out fantastic!!!! My boyfriend even said it was the best "baked concoction" I've ever made!

Cannot wait to try this recipe again once the muffin pans get unpacked. This will certainly be an often-used recipe in my household!!

These were delicious!!!  I doubled the recipe and ended up getting 24 muffins instead of the amounts listed. Also I used water instead of milk (due to allergies in the house) and it didn't seem to hurt it at all...they were still fluffy and moist! And the peachy flavor wasn't overwhelming as I thought it might be-I am not a huge peach fan. ;)
I'm excited to try this with other fruits!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

These were pretty nice. I used canned peaches (I didn't have fresh) and no nectarines. I also used half white and half brown sugar. They are a little bland; next time I'd like to substitute some of the oil with some peach puree to add more flavor. All the same, the texture is nice, they're sweet, and my FAVORITE part was the crunchy brown sugar on top. I'd make these again with some tweaking.

These taste fantastic and I've made them several times. It is a great way to use up  ripe peaches and nectarines. I must admit this is the first time I have ever made muffins from scratch. I'll never go back to the cheap muffin in a bag again!

I just made these for breakfast, and they were wonderful! My changes: Used only peaches, used part applesauce part oil, added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla as suggested, used 1/2 c wheat flour in place of regular, used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. They were very peachy, and I'll definitely make them again.

So I have to admit I don't follow this recipe as is.  The biggest change I make is that instead of fresh fruit, I use a Del Monte fruit cup - the mango and peach kind - scooping out all the fruit and adding the syrup into the batter until it's got the right consistency.  It probably makes the muffins much sweeter than with actual fruits, but I've got a sweet tooth, so I like them just fine.  The other changes I make are to substitute 3/4 cup white sugar with half white, half brown, and to add a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon; and I skip the milk, using the syrup for the same purpose instead.  Using the fruit cup really makes this recipe so convenient - I've made it four times in two months already!  Plus I love that it uses vegetable oil instead of butter.

Yum. I used 1 nectarine and 1 peach and didn't bother to peel them. They are extremely moist - maybe I underbaked them a little. But the flavor is great! A little heavy on the baking powder, maybe. I might cut back on that a little next time.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly - but I guess that's what we do on this site! I used 3/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup white flour, added 1/3 cup ground flax, increased the milk to 1/2 cup, and added 1 tsp vanilla.  i used 2 peaches that weren't that sweet so I added about 1 tablespoon sugar to the diced peaches before mixing into the batter.  I didn't top the muffins with brown sugar at all.  These are best when they are completely cooled, or even better the next day.

Oh my goodness - I can't stop baking muffins!!  Yum, yum, YUM!  These were excellent.  But of course, I can never make something without adjusting the recipe.  I used 1 C wheat flour + 1/2 C white; didn't have nectarines so used 3 small ripe peaches; ran out of sugar so substituted just under 3/4 C organic maple syrup instead (yum!!) and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger per another reviewer's suggestion.  Of course, also had to add raisins.  Baked about 19 mins. DELICIOUS!  These were very much like little individual cobblers that would be a GREAT dessert out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.  Mmmm! Also, boiling the peaches just a few seconds does make the skin remove easily.  Lastly, do not mix the ingredients "well" as the recipe instructs-- keep dry and wet ingredients separate, then mix JUST enough to moisten & your muffins won't come out "rubbery" or tough.  Mmm! Thanks!

I made this with all peaches and tweaked it a bit like others had suggested...I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/4c brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and these were delicious.  My kids love them which is always a good thing!  I will definitely be making these again!

I was a little unsure on step #2 if I should add both the white and brown sugars or just the white sugar. I think I should have added both *duh*, so it was my fault these needed a little extra something. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as someone else suggested, but it still wasn't "enough" flavoring in my opinion. And make sure to put enough brown sugar on the tops! I'll definately make these again, just experiment a little more.

These muffins have to be some of THE BEST Ive had. So moist, and fresh tasting. Our 4 year old son LOVED them. The brown sugar on top is an added pleasure. A must try!

Delicious!!  I used two barely ripe nectarines.  I ended up having enough batter for 10 muffins, probably because my nectarines were big.  The muffins are moist and flavorful, but not too sweet.  My family members who don't go for my typical chocolate-filled creations loved these.

I only had 2 super ripe nectarines on hand, so I used those.  They hubby LOVED these. These were good, but even after halving the sugar they were still very sweet - I'd probably go down to a 1/4 cup next time when using really ripe fruits.  I'd like to try this with the peach as written next time to see if it kicks up the fruit flavor a bit.  This looked like another recipe that added the oil and egg to a 1 cup measure, then to fill the rest with milk - I was going to do it then didn't. Next time I will - I needed to add more milk as the batter was really thick without it.  This took 22 minutes in my oven.

We both really liked the muffins as the recipe was written. I think that the suggestion of adding some vanilla may be a good idea to make them even better than the awesome that they already were.

I have made these several times since I saw this recipe a few weeks ago.  Honestly, the best homemade muffin ever!  I haven't had peaches, so I have just been using 2 nectarines per batch and they still turn out awesome! (Also I added in vanilla, pumpkin pie seasoning and cinnamon based on others comments)

Soooo yummy. I used 2 peaches because that's what I had. I also added a little cinnamon and about a 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. I got 12 muffins, not 8. I am definitely making this again but might make it in a square pan instead of muffins.

These are excellent. I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I added about 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I only used nectarines. I used a little less milk than was called for because the nectarines were very juicy (and I might have used a bit more fruit than what the original poster had in mind) -- the batter was still very liquidy but baked into light, moist, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth muffins. For me, this made 12 smallish/regular muffins and 8 mini muffins.

I loved these, and so did my kids! I did make a few changes. I made a double batch and used all very ripe peaches. I used half whole wheat and half whole oat flour. I added a very generous pinch of cinnamon and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. I will be making this again!!

Love this recipe. I only had peaches, so that's what I used.  There was a little too much of the dice fruit, so I pureed 1/3 of it and kept the rest diced.  I also used a blond streusel topping of 1/2 C all purpose, 1/3 C sugar, 1/8tsp salt, 3 Tbs cold unsalted butter and 1-1/2 tsp milk/cream.  It was a big hit!!!

These were good, but a little bland, even after taking other's suggestion of adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I doubled- the recipe, but used 2-1/2 cups white flour with 1/2 cup wheat flour.  Used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  Also subbed 4 oz applesauce for part of the oit.   2 peaches, 1 nectarine, and 1 apricot; the batter was very thick, so I added 2 Tblsp milk and 1 Tblsp oil.  As others also suggested, much prettier with some cinnamon-brown sugar sprinkled on top.  Will try making these again tonight and add another peach, but will mash it up to try to give the muffins better flavor.

Pretty good, I made mini-muffins so I suppose that is why a lot of the fruit fell out.  Will make full size next time.

MMMMMM, yummy!  I had both peaches and nectarines that were well ripened, so wanted to use them up instead of throw them out!  I doubled this recipe & used both brown and white sugar - 3/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown (yes, cut sugar down a bit), 2 tsps cin and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and used half vegetable oil and half unsweetened appleauce.  Used one egg with 2 egg whites to use up my carton!  Baked at 375 for 15 mins, perfect!

These were so yummy.  I ate 3 straight out of the oven!  I only had nectarines, which were super sweet but rather small, so I used 4-5 of them and no peaches.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I forgot to add the other spices that they suggested, but they were great as is!  I might make another batch tomorrow.  The recipe made 12 for me.

I used pears and nectarines because that is what I had on hand and needed to use up. I read a few of the "bland" reviews so  added about half a can of whole berry cranberry sauce which really added a nice bit of tang. They were a bit like cobbler but we really liked that about them.

I made the changes suggested by other people but also added pecans to half.  The ones that had the pecans were a hit... the others were okay but not that great.  I think if I will probably skip making these again though as they weren't that great.

This is a great recipe! I am thrilled to have a made from scratch muffin recipe in my collection! I made them as directed, but tripled the batch to make 24 muffins. They turned out beautiful! My family enjoyed them for a Sunday morning breakfast. Thanks Bean13!

Tasty and moist muffins!  I made them with 2 nectarines (no peaches) and added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg as another reviewer suggested and I have to say these are outstanding!  What a great way to use up fruit that is ripening faster than you can eat it. Fast and easy.  Try them, you won't be sorry.

I was browsing through the Daily Recipes when I came across this one. Good thing,
too, because I had several ripe peaches and nectarines I'd been wanting to use.

Easy to make and has a light taste. Not overpowering. I added a tsp. of vanilla to the batter, that was the only thing
I changed. These will be good to stick
in the freezer for my husband who drives
a truck and often is running late and dosen't have time for a hot breakfast.

I think next time I might add a tsp. of nutmeg or cinnamon.

I cooked mini muffins on the top rack for a little longer than 15 minutes.  They turned out tasty and moist.  But they didnt have much of a nectarine flavor even though I used 2 and 1/2 large and very ripe nectarines (no peaches).  I also left out the milk because the batter was already very moist, and I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and tbsp vanilla (didnt have any nutmeg).  
I also altered the recipe to make it a little healthier.  I used less oil, 3/4 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.

These were really good...super moist.  I've made them a couple times now and the second time I made them with two peaches (no nectarines) and since they were such large peaches, I should have only used about one and a half chopped.  The end result was really moist and dense, but they sank a little during the cooling process due to all the moisture (I even baked them longer than the recipe suggested).  My hubby still loved them, but I like them to be pretty too. :)  So next time I'll be more careful about how much fruit I use.

Yummy!  I doubled the recipe and added 6 peaches.  For a more healthy recipe, I also used a sugar substitute instead of white sugar and egg beaters instead of eggs.  1TBSP of vanilla, 2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of nutmeg was perfect for the double recipe!

I thought these were very good. I only used nectarines because that was what I had on hand. I used two and a half large nectarines and felt I could have used three. I also used only 1/4 cup of milk as per other reviewers advice and it was plenty.

I used half white and half wheat flour on this recipe, and I also used only nectarines. The muffins turned out very well, but they could have used a little more spice, I felt. Still good, though, and I'll definitely make them again.

I added 1/4 cup rolled oats, a half cup of additional flour, a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon, and used a 12 ounce can of canned peaches packed in juice (with about half the juice drained) and substituted buttermilk for regular milk. Superb muffins.

Very southern tasting.  Light.  Try using applesauce instead of butter for a low-fat version.

These turned out great! I made a double batch. did half as written and half adding cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and a dash of ginger. The ones as written you can taste the fruit better. The ones with the added spices were equally as good but the fruit flavor was masked.

The muffins were moist, flavourful and delicious. I will make them again this week. The muffins didn’t last long and it is peach season so it’s the best time to make them.

Loved these muffins!  The fresh sun ripened peaches really showed through the not over sweet muffin.  And I appreciated the much less amount of oil in the recipe.  Will keep this one!

My roommate and I made this recipe and doubled it. We made sure we used all the correct measurements, but the "batter" did not turn out. It became the consistency of a dough. We added more of the wet ingredients, but we could not get the consistency correct.

Loved this recipe. Made a slight change that was wonderful. I used French vanilla creamer in place of the mild and it added a light flavor that my family loved. Great with my family that doesn't eat fruit desserts much but the devoured these muffins. Great recipe.

I made this recipe yesterday, and just loved it. I didn't have any peaches, though, so I had to double the nectarines in order to get a good fruity flavor. Even then, the recipe was a hit. I hope to make this for many years to come.

I've made some slight changes like sprinkling the diced fruit with lemon juice, brown sugar and some brandy. I drained the fruit before blending it in the dough mix. It's a ver nice recipe.

Awesome muffins!!  I added a little cinnamon and some vanilla to the mix, but otherwise, just followed the recipe.  It's like eating peach cobbler in muffin form.  I will make them again for sure.  Great recipe.

Delicious, although I changed more of the recipe than I kept! I doubled it, for a start; used all nectarines, no peaches; swapped the vegetable oil for butter; used half yoghurt and half milk; added vanilla and cinnamon; used half brown sugar and half white; and put a proper streusel topping on top. The resulting muffins were delicious! I will make these again - we have nectarine trees in the vicinity. 

I did find the muffins tasted slightly of baking powder; I'll scant the last teaspoon next time.

Very good muffin recipe!  They are best the day they are made, but still okay the next.  I also added a tsp. of cinnamon and used all nectarines as I had some that needed to be used.  I meant to add vanilla but forgot.  Lemon zest would also be a wonderful addition.  I will try it next time!

I only had nectarines on hand (that I *really* needed to use up), so just went with that fruit.  I also halved the sugar and threw in some vanilla.  Husband and I really like them and I will be making them again with whatever fruit I have on hand at the time.

Made these tonight because I have a bunch of nectarines and needed something quick for breakfast in the morning. The only change I made was using all nectarines, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It did not turn out at all.  Instead of nice rounded domes I have muffin spread across the top of my muffin pan.  I figured I could deal with that all right, but they also stuck to the pan and I had greased the pan well, prepping it the same as I would for any muffin.  I figured that wasn't too big a deal, I could just run a knife around the edges and pop them out with a big spoon.  Well that worked but then the muffin fell apart completely.  So much for a quick, easy to take on the run breakfast. Maybe when people post baking recipes they could give their general geographic area because I am pretty sure that my spreading problem is due to the fact that I live above 5,000 ft altitude and I am betting the recipe is more for sea level or very low altitude.

I made this with just nectarines and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. They came out really really yummy. I will definitely make this again!

I adjusted the recipe to make 12 muffins. I had enough batter to do 12 regular muffins & 12 mini's. They were very tasty, similar flavor to a pineapple upside down cake. My minis were perfect. The regular size were a little too moist and probably could have been cooked a little longer. Will make them again when I have left over ripened fruit.

What a great muffin! Nice gentle taste. I partly blended my fruit instead of chopped, so it was less visible and my son would eat it. (which he did by the way! yay!). Also, I confess I added a bit of cinnamon. I will make these again for sure. Thanks.

This is a great muffin. I used 2 very ripe nectarines, added a good squirt of almond extract (about 1/2 tsp.) and about 1 tsp. of cinnamon. There's no shortage of flavor here!

Loved it, loved it, LOVED IT! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe. So fantastically good. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. I will say that I made a little addition as some of the other reviewers suggested - frozen pureed raspberries (I also left out the peaches, as I didn't have any). They made the muffins a fantastically cheery pink color. Everyone at work loved them! My husband ate half a dozen fresh out of the oven! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was a very simple recipe to make and they baked up nice and pretty. They were, however, a little bland even after adding some extra vanilla and cinnamon. Good way to use up peaches in season, though.

These were great and so filling!  I had a ton of peaches and nectarines to use, so I doubled the recipe with 3 peaches and 5 small nectarines. Followed several suggestions here and added a splash of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Didn't peel the fruit-- chopped it and threw it in the food processor to turn in to a chunky puree.  It made a dozen perfect, heavy & moist but not soggy muffins.  Great out of the oven with a pat of butter.

I'm a novice baker and found this very easy to make.  I used 5 small, very ripe nectarines and took the advice of others by adding 1 Tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 Tbs vanilla.  I also added 1/4 cup of oatmeal and waited to add the milk until after I mixed everything together. The batter was so moist that I ended up only using 1/4 cup of milk.  It made 12 muffins (in a cupcake tin).  

It seems like the recipe is pretty forgiving, so next time I'll try other people's advice of making it healthier by mixing whole wheat flour and oatmeal along with apple sauce instead of oil.

I used nectarine only. Made 12 servings. I add cinnamon, nitron and vanilla. I don't have muffin tray so I baked using bread loaf tray. This is the first time I made muffin and I don't have background for baking. I bake for 50 minutes at 200 C. My father-in-law and my husband loves it, and so do I.

Yummy! I had tart nectarines that I used with this recipe.  5 small ones, to be exact.  I sprinkled in a little cinnamon, a little drizzle of vanilla and skipped the brown sugar topping.  They were delicious and even made 15 muffins!

These were GREAT, even without the peaches being very ripe. I increased the sugar to 1 cup since I didn't have nectarines and my peaches weren't very sweet. These were REALLY good! I'll be making a lot this summer when my peaches all start ripening at the same time.

I made them with brown sugar and added cinnamon and cloves, I also mashed the peaches instead of dicing them.

Pretty good.    The muffins were moist and the brown sugar melted nicely on top.  I didn't think they had a lot of flavor though, but I only used nectarines.  Unique recipe.

These are very good.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour, and half applesauce for the oil.  I also used skim milk, and needed the full 1/3 cup.  I used only peaches and tried to chop them in my processor, but ended up pureeing some of them.  Still good though.  Added vanilla and cinnamon.

The whole family enjoyed these flavorful muffins!  I used only nectarines and followed the recipe given, but next time I might try a whole wheat variation listed in some of the reviews.  Yummy!!!

I loved these muffins!  They were still moist and fresh the next day.  I am sending this one to my sister!

Excellent recipe!  These muffins were as good on the fourth day as they were coming out of the oven.  Thanks Beth!
