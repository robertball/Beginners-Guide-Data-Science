A pretty salad.  I used less mayo because I don't like mayo much.  I also added some spices/fresh herbs.  Bright colors and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a casual picninc/barbque and everyone did the full-mouth head nod and continued eating.  Usually I get some yes and some no but this was an all around pretty good.

Veggies, veggies and more veggies.  This recipe has a wonderful combination of 7 different vegetables.  My family loved this and have requested I make it again.  The only change I made was to use fresh corn instead of frozen corn.  A plus was the leftovers held up nicely without getting watery for the lunch the next day.  Thanks Lori for sharing this.  It went well with Super BLT's from this site.

This salad is amazing.. I have never had corn salad before. I did replace italian dressing for mayo and next time I will try some Lime & Cilantro as the dressing. This is a great combination for the taste buds :) I hope its a hit at the party tomorrow!

This is easy, it's refreshing, it's colorful, and it's healthy! What more could you ask? I left out the cukes because my husband doesn't care for them, and used lite mayo to lower the fat and calories a tad. I'll serve this often, especially during the summer. Thanks, Lori, for the recipe!

Easy to make and tastes great.  I added fresh basil from garden and used cherry tomatos.  I think it tasted even better.

I really wanted to try this but we don't eat mayo so I substituted fat free sour cream and caesar salad dressing, I didn't measure just added enough to the vegetables, my family really liked it.

My family has been making something similar to this for years. As a time saver we use canned mexicorn that already has the peppers in it. But the addition of cucumber is new to us. We also sometimes add diced avocado(we have an avocado tree).

Great receipe, very easy to prepare! We had 3 ears of corn leftover from grilling. Sliced the kernels off of those which added extra flavor. Used lite mayo. Just add a little Salt & Pepper.  My daughter even used part of this salad mixed with romaine lettuce & canned tuna the next day for a great light lunch.  Will definitely make again and again

Great recipe for getting the kids to eat veggies. I used red and orange peppers since they seem sweeter, along with the cucumbers and some red onion. Couldn't decide on spices so I added Mrs. Dash to the mayo and mixed before adding to salad. My 12 yr old won't eat "salad" so my 10 yr old changed the name to "medley" and that worked. Great recipe with no heating the kitchen up!!

This was yummy and easy.  I didn't have cucumbers or tomato so left it out.  Also I added some dill seasoning to the mayo.  Used it for a salad at our church Sunday Lunch!  Thanks for for the good idea!

Wow! I used light mayo and after reading reviews, threw a couple squeezes of lime in and some fresh basil. This is soooo good. This will be the perfect summer side and so healthy! Also added a little salt and fresh cracked pepper and I don't even think hubby will get to try this, might eat it all myself:) Excellent recipe

I made this with some changes (thanks to reviews) & it turned out great.  I used the veg I had on hand only green/red bell peppers & green onion.  I used 50% Hellmann's Mayo w/Olive Oil & 50% fat-free sour cream & added some dried dill weed.  Will try variations of this in the future.

This is a great alternative salad that you can have for a couple of days.  I didn't have a green pepper but did have an orange one - don't think it matters what colours you use.  Didn't have a red onion but did have green onions so I chopped up some of those and I also added a bit of dried dillweed.  Turned out great - my husband loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

My mother made this my whole life - except, of course, for the yellow bell peppers - green was the only type available back then. It always makes me think of summer and I can eat a whole bowl of it as a meal in itself! Thanks for reminding me of it - I love to serve it with grilled chicken or burgers.

I also doubled the ingredients because it was a hit at our potluck. Used cherry tomatoes and fresh basil, and used Italian dressing instead of mayo, because that's how I grew up eating corn salad. Loved how colorful it was with all the peppers!

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I wanted something different than rice or beans to go with fish tacos. I added a little fresh lime juice and some fresh cilantro. It was a nice change for a side dish.  Next time I will try part sour cream and mayo.

This is a great recipe!  Can add or delete ingredients to liking.  If bland, add your own spices to spice it up!  Very colorful, super easy and quick to make, serves well.  My crowd gave it a definite thumbs up! Can top it off with Cheetos, which appeals to some taste buds.  Make it your own to taste!

I did not use mayo; I used the juice from a jar of jalepeno peppers and olive oil.  It was very fresh and crisp.  Lovely textures and colors.

Incredibly yummy!  I did make a change though.  I just couldn't bring myself to put mayo in this.  Instead I used bottled zesty italian dressing. Approx. 1/2 cup (I had doubled the recipe) was just right.

Try adding a bit of shredded cheese and right before serving crush some Chili Cheese Fritos into the salad.  Changes it a bit and it's delicious!

This was a really nice alternative to plain corn.  I didn't have the peppers, but tripled the cucumber and added some garlic salt and a dash of lemon pepper.  I also used Ranch Dressing because I got all the veges put together and found out I didn't have Mayonnaise.  Ooops!  It turned out well despite that and my family ate it up!

Really didn't much care for this. I made it  for a work party, and although I doubled the recipe, I followed it to a " T".   I thought it was pretty bland...and watery.  The water from the vegetables wound up making the mayonnaise watery. It was kind of a soupy, bland mess. Would not make again.

I will be making this yummy salad again. I followed the ingredients in the recipe as written but I didn't measure anything.  

Next time I may add a bit of lime juice and cilantro.

This is so good! I used fresh sweet corn since we had it on sale at the store where I work, and I chopped up the onion and pepper with some garlic and let it soak in balsamic vinegar and white vinegar for about 30 minutes to "pickle" a bit before draining and mixing into the salad. I also used avocado oil mayo. So delicious!

Of course I made some changes.  You know that part of the celery in the middle that is mostly leaves?  I cut that up, cut up 4 fresh mint leaves and 6 fresh basil leaves mixed all that with the mayo and onions and let is all rest together while I cut up the other veg.  I was making a large amount so I used the whole peppers, a whole english cuke and a large tomato as well as 2 bags of frozen corn I froze last summer from the local organic farm.  I credit this corn with the incredible flavor.  add salt pepper juice of 1/2 a lime and voila!!  Incredible!!!!

Easy and good!  Followed as is but used a homemade creamy Italian dressing from another corn salad recipe on here since I had some leftover.  Made it last night and can't wait to eat more today.

I wasn't sure how this was going to taste being that mayo was the only ingredient for the dressing and typically I would try to "doctor" it up but I decided to just do what the recipe called for and was pleasantly surprised. But I did end up "doctoring". When I got home from the store, I realized I forgot the cucumber so I omitted those and added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) at my husbands request, and it turned out very good!!

I made this using fresh sweet corn from the cob, and I added green onions and a bit of fresh chopped cilantro instead of red onions. I also left out the mayo to make it a bit lower calorie. It tasted absolutely delicious and everyone finished their servings.

This is the best BBQ/picnic/potluck salad. I was going to add my recipe until I found it already on here. My only suggestion - double the ingredients because it goes fast!

This was very different.  I felt the onions took over the taste.  I will use less onions (probably green onions) the next time.  That way the other flavors will stand out.

I wasn't crazy over this. There were so many other veggies that the corn got drowned out. It also needs spices - I used salt, pepper and basil.
