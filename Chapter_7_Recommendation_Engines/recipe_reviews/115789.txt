We really liked this after a few additions. We added 1/2 can evaporated milk 1 tsp basil 2 cloves garlic to the blender and a few dashes (to taste) of hot sauce to each individual bowl. My kids said gross we don't eat green food and then they finished their bowls. Great fun detox before all the candy this week. Doubled made way too much for 6 people so we froze the second half. Next time I would also cut back on the olive oil by about 1/2.

This soup is really yummy. I loved it just as it is (except for taking the advice to halve the oil). It is filling and rich. I poured a little bit of half 'n half I had left from another recipe into each bowl and gave it a swirl it looked great that way.

This was the PERFECT soup to serve to my grandsons ages 6 5 3. They loved the taste but of course the fun name and look of the soup. It will be a halloween tradition from now on

Yummy soup. I made this a day in advance and the flavor did improve a lot. I left out the oil entirely and just topped the dish with a drizzle of some hot pepper olive oil and a few red pepper flakes

This was good! We used fresh onion instead of onion powder and just blended it with the other veggies.

This soup was a big hit.. and I feel healthy! It was a little bland so I added hot chili pepper which made everyone happy! I topped with Parmesan cheese instead. A great way to get a big dose of greens.
