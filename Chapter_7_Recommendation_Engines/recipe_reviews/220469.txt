Honestly, this was a little weird.  Irish cream just doesn't go all that well with the other ingredients on the list. The sauces on the chicken and beans tasted more like they belonged on a dessert than a dinner.  There is absolutely no seasoning anywhere in this recipe. Maybe it's implied, but "salt and pepper to taste" would be the bare minimum. I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chicken before baking. One hour is a long time to bake boneless chicken breasts, and mine were pretty dried out even though I stopped the baking after 50 minutes. Stuffing the chicken with uncooked bacon sounded like a very bad idea, so I did cook my bacon first. It did not overcook even after 50 minutes. I added freshly ground black pepper to the green beans. These were my favorite part of the meal, before I added the sauce (I skipped the peanuts).  I also added pepper to the potatoes, which I put into the oven for about 20 minutes while the chicken was baking.  I ended up adding salt and more pepper to them before eating them.  In short, this meal wasn't a success, especially for the amount of work it required, and my husband hardly ate any of his portion. I won't be making it again.  Sorry.

The Irish cream was too much.. The family liked the chicken, bacon, cheese, will make a different sauce. Green beans. Didn't make the potatoe in this recipe did some creamy au gratin.

Dont listen to the haters. The Irish cream was amazing. We made our own. Everything turned out perfect. The green beans were pobably the best part.

Ya know, I'm a nubie at being a cook and I chomp at the big recipes.  I had a top notch experience with the chicken and the beans/bacon, though the latter required a good bit of time and work.  We enjoyed making our own Irish Cream, and quite honestly the flavors were unexpectedly delicious for all of this recipe.  To each his/her own if you didn't like it. Smiles were plastered on our faces!
