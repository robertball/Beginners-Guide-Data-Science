Recipe is fantastic. I disagree with a previous review that squid takes forever to clean though - it is very quick and easy. Cut the tentacles off just in front of the eyes. Remove the beak. Slide your finger down the back of the tube and break through the membrane holding the body in the tube. Pull the body and guts out. Slide your finger down under the cartilage and lift up - the cartilage will now come out. Slice the skin with a knife and peel off.

Taste very good.  My husband and I love it.  I use pineapple crushed in a can and it still turned out so good.

I agree this is a very good dish. Remember you can add tomatoes and cubed bell peppers in this dish too and garnish it with cilantro! :)

YUM! I'd never cooked with squid before, so I was a little worried, but this turned out just great!  I actually used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce because I had it around. Not fishy tasting at all:)

Growing up in a Vietnamese household, I would have to say this dish is very bland. My mom always used tomatoes in this dish. Cut them up into quarters and cook with the celery. I put spring onions in whenever I make this dish.  If you don't want to clean the squid, you can buy them already cleaned and cut up if you wanted to. I've gotten them at the Asian supermarkets like that.

We did not like this at all (I'm American my girlfriend is of Vietnamese decent).  A very mild mellow flavor.  The flavors didnt blend or meld together well.   "Fried" is the wrong term for it.  Like another reviewer said, there are better uses for squid.  Too much fish sauce also.

This was fairly bland, so I added some chili sauce, which kicked it up a bit. All in all, I'm sure I could find a better way to prepare squid. Not horrible, but probably won't make it again.

I used mango instead of pineapple.  Ignored the sugar and celery.  Then I chilled and it was really good.  It was a bit oily but mango provided a sweet counterbalance to red peppers I added.

So good! I switched out the fish sauce with oyster sauce and vegetable oil with olive oil. Definitely not bland, and actually quite a hit. Worth a try, to say the least.

Not too "into" this one.  The celery contradicts the pineapple, onion and fish sauce...  Interesting.   Maybe "just not my thing".
