This was great. I did not pay the chicken dry after they were out if the marinade. It gave a lot if flavour and broiled the top of the chicken after they were done baking. Served with herb roasted potatoes, saut√©e peppers,onions and snowpeas with balsamic glaze. Finished with a nice kale slaw at the end of the meal.  Bbq'ing this will be great too.
