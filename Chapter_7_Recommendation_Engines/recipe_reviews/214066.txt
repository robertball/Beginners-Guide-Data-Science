I have made this recipe many times.  The only difference in my version, is to use chocolate pudding.  I use a clear glass bowl and place gummy worms along the edge  and on top for added effect.  Children love it!

This is the old DIRT PUDDING recipe, except I layer the cookie crumbs w/ pudding mixture until u end w/ cookie crumbs to look like "dirt." You can put gummy worms or chocolate mushrooms on top, still fil in a bucket & serve w/ shovel. It's a great recipe I have been making for over 30 yrs!!

The first time I had this, (it was called "dirt" then), I was visiting my parents and at supper, there was a flower pot in the middle of the table with plastic flowers in it. When we were finished eating, Dad said, "Ready for dessert?" Then he took a spoon and started dipping out the "dirt" in the flower pot. I was shocked for a minute until I realized what it was. Dad had great fun pulling that joke on us. This is very delicious too!

This is a classic and especially fun for spring and summer time groups! I have made this with my boys a few times and they love it. Like another user posted I also like to use chocolate pudding! It's delicious and fun even though the name is rather gross.  And finding the worms in the mud is kind of exciting. I like to fold a few (gummy) worms into the mud, and strategically place some on the top poking out.

I have made dirt for years and placed the mixture in a terra cotta pot and placed a bouquet of silk flowers in it with gummy worms and bugs crawling around the flowers.  We used a new garden shovel for the spoon.  I also used chocolate pudding to make it mud colored!  Great recipe!

I used two boxes of Jello brand Oreo pudding. I also added a small box of sugar free vanilla pudding to make it a little thicker. I lined the bottom of my pan with whole oreos instead of making the crust. I added whipped topping and cream cheese to the pudding mixture and then spread over the cookies. I topped that with broken cookies, then a layer of whipped topping, then another layer of cookies. I used 1.5 packages of oreos in all. YUMMY! Very thick and delicious!

Made this for a 4th of July picnic in a small beach bucket.  It was such a HUGE hit! The kids can't get enough of this and the adults went for seconds too!
My kids had a blast helping me make "the mud".  I see this as a new tradition for us!  Thanks for sharing!l
FYI:  I would even taste good added to an oreo cookie or graham pie crust and served as a pudding type pie.

I used golden Oreos instead of regular to make a Bucket of Sand. I saved a cup of crushed cookies to layer on top. I reduced the amount of margarine blended with the cream cheese and will likely leave it out next time as I don't think it's necessary. You could also use Vienna Fingers instead of the Oreos. This recipe is a hit!

This recipe is delicious and fun to have your child/children make with you. First time I made it, I did the gummie insects (you can get more then worms) and then put it in the largest toy dump truck I could find. I then had the children serve themselves from the truck. MESSY and FUN. And as a side note, my little girl is not fat, extremely active and healthy. I served this dessert at her birthday party (as well as cake and ice cream) the last three years and then the children played outside. I guarantee those children burned more calories than they consumed.

Jeez, it may not sound appetizing, but give it a try sometime because it is a great dessert! I like to assemble mine in a large glass baking dish with a layer of extra cookie crumbs on top. I'm licking my lips looking at the empty baking dish- maybe I can scrape just a bit more off the side? Be right back-

Everyone loved this dessert at my son's graduation party. Very tasty.  I don't know why it is called Bucket of Mud when it looks like cookies and cream but it was really good.

I just made this tonight for Easter Dinner tomorrow.. I think my guests will like it, the spoons sure tasted good!  I put ''Peeps'' around the edge of the 7" plastic bucket and gummy worms coming out in the center & between ''Peeps''.. I reserved about 1/2 cup of ground up Oreo Cookies to put on top of the pudding mixture.. Now it looks like ''Dirt'' !!

I thought this would be a fun dessert for my 3 boys.  They absolutely loved it!  I made it just as the recipe stated, but I also added in gummy worms and some more oreo crumbs at the top of the bucket.  It was a big hit in our family!  I'd definitely make it again.

While endlessly looking for a rich and entising dessert, I found this recipe, and just the name of it made it sound heavenly!  I decided to use melted butter and soft cream cheese, mixed in with thick vanilla pudding. Yum!  For a garnish, I just used chocolate chip cookies.  Can't wait to share it with the family!
