I was worried that the sugar wouldn't dissolve and the dip would be gritty, but it actually disappears quite nicely into the cream cheese. I thought a full cup of sugar sounded like a lot, so I cut that in half, and then added in a couple tablespoons of raspberry preserves - oh man is this stuff good. It's like crack. I could eat this all day long.

I've been making this for years and have never met anyone who didn't love it.

To make it lighter and just as yummy, I now use LIGHT cream cheese and 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar.  I tried fat free cream cheese and the outcome was very runny and had an odd taste.

I think this recipe is delicious! One addition I made was a tbsp of cinnamon! It complimented the fruit very nicely! Especially the apples and bananas!

This is a quick, easy dip that tastes wonderful. One of the things I did differently was to add a bit of heavy whipping cream (probably 1/4 cup) during the process in order to use it as a layer in a dessert (fresh fruit layered with this cream and some pound cake) and it was VERY well received.

This is a really good dip.  I just gave it a trial run, as I want to take it and a couple of other fruit dips along with fruit skewers to a neighborhood party this weekend.  It's delicious, and a nice change.

Now I have bit of a sweet tooth, but this was disgusting as written. I might as well have eaten a spoonful of sugar. Adding an extra 8oz of cream cheese made it more edible.

So sweet-maybe needed half the brown sugar.  Also, vanilla should be cut to 1 tsp.

After reading the reviews I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the full cup.  It turned out AWESOME!!  It got rave reviews at my family picnic and I am definitely going to make this again!!

I made this for a group of middle school boys.  Some of them were a little hesitant at first, but by the time it was over several of them were asking me for the recipe so they could get their moms to make it!  

I actually used brown sugar/Splenda blend instead of straight brown sugar and it was REALLY good!

My son and husband loved this, but I thought there was way too much vanilla in the recipe.  It felt like I was eating carrot cake cream cheese frosting.  I gave this 4 stars because 2 out of 3 likes isn't bad, not to mention, this was super quick and easy to make.

very good, I picked it because everything else seems to have marshmallows and I didn't want it to be too sweet.  Just the right amount, a bit thick though, I added 1/8 cup cream to thin it out

It was good. I liked the brown sugar. Those recipes that call for white sugar & cream cheese, the cream cheese is overpowering. I like to do my own thing with recipes. With this one I added cinnamon

I wanted a fruit dip recipe without that marshmallow stuff.  This was great!  I used the suggestions to cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet.

I took one viewers advise and used less sugar. I used 1/2 a cup of sugar and that was plenty. A cup would have been too sweet for my taste. Other than that, the dip was delicious - better than store bought!

Just made this as a breakfast for my family as an lighter option since we're about to start the cooking fest for Thanksgiving with a lot of rich foods. 

I used reduced fat whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar instead of the 1 cup (which seemed to be a lot to me), 2 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tblspn of heavy cream to help with texture. 

It turned out really good with just enough sweetness to  offset the green apples, strawberries, and blueberries we had. It wasn't gritty at all and was very fluffy.

My daughter loved it and asked if this can be breakfast every morning! That's high praise in our house.

I personally LOVED this.  I made it for my Holiday Mocktail Party to go as a "beard" dip for Grinch Grapes, but my guests told me that it was good but way too sweet and no one had more than a taste.  Pity, because I ended up eating it for three days with my fruit at breakfast...It Is A Very Good Dip!!!  :-)

Liked that it was only three simple ingredients.  I cut the brown sugar and vanilla in 1/2 and the dip still had plenty of sweetness and flavor.

so easy and delicious! I did add a little cherry juice (bottled cherries) to thin it out a bit more, but any juice will do. Will definitely make this again.

Yummy!!!  I used softened cream cheese and stirred with a spoon.  I didn't even need to get the mixer out.  It wasn't gritty at all and only took a few minutes to stir together.  Tastes great with strawberries!

Only thing I did different was add a dash of skim milk to make it not so thick. Love the flavor with dark brown sugar

Have made something similar.  A suggestion to add Skor bits especially if using with apples.  Kahlua instead of vanilla would also be good.

omg, I just finished making this bc I've been craving fruit and dip. My dad brought me fruit but said he couldn't find dip so I decided I could make my own. This was the simplest recipe! It took way less than 10 mins and I didn't even have to buy anything! Plus it's really delicious! Thanks so much ! 5 STARS !!

This recipe was a huge hit at a potluck party recently. Everyone wanted the recipe. Some thought it tasted like caramel, others were reminded of cookie dough. Either way it pleased us all. And not only was it delicious, it was quick and easy to make. Love it!

Was looking for a fruit dip to take to a party. I had cream cheese and wanted to find a recipe with ingredients I already had. This dip is really delicious. People were asking me where I got the light and fluffy caramel!  No one could believe it was just 3 ingredients

Made this quickly with the 3 ingredients, but did think it a bit sweet, so I added about 1/2 of a 6 oz. vanilla yogurt to the recipe and it made it much more palatable and "less stiff"..  Disappeared quickly.  Served with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.

I hate leaving reviews when I make changes to the recipe but it has to be noted that I did make changes according to my personal taste. Upon reading reviews I decided to add the sugar a little at a time and taste so as not to make it too sweet. I ended up using just under 1/2 c. I also only used about a teaspoon of vanilla. On fruit this is perfect but for crackers I poured a little of my homemade strawberry jam on top. I don’t feel people need to leave a negative review if something isn’t to your taste. Change it up. Add a little at a time and work it according to your taste. Everyone is different, everyone has different tastes.

Good but too sweet, and I only used 1/2cup brown sugar, pressed into the 1/2c measuring cup. Then I added about 1/2c plain yogurt to try and make it less sweet.

I'm the only one that eats fruit dip, and usually just with raspberries or blueberries, so the simplicity of it made it easy to make 1/4 of the original recipe. Very good, VERY sweet! I will definitely be making all the time for my snacks

I made this, but it was just too sweet and rich for me. I make cream cheese fruit dip, but I use marshmallow cream instead of brown sugar and vanilla extract. 8 oz. Cream cheese + 7 oz. Kraft Marshmallow Cream make the perfect fruit dip for apples, strawberries, bananas, grapes, etc.

I made this two days ago as a dessert for my Shrimp Broil dinner. I must say my son and his girlfriend loved it. As a matter of fact, he likes this recipe better than the one I've been making for years. So do I. I didn't have powdered sugar which is used in the other fruit dip recipe. So I scammed through some recipes (because I really didn't want to go back out to pick some up) and found this one. Lucky enough I had everything the recipe called for. This is now my new family fruit dip. The one time it really paid off not to run back to the store....lol. Thanks for sharing it.

I had a package of strawberries that were really sour tasting and I needed something to make it so I could eat them! Wouldn't want them to go to waste just because I can't handle sour flavors! I tried this recipe and it worked wonderful! I loved it! I will definitely be making this again.

I've been making this for years! It's a friends and family favorite! I usually have to double or triple the recipe! I hate cream cheese but I don't mind it at all in this recipe! Also, I use neufchâtel cheese and the consistency is a little runny, but I let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour and it thickens up.

I remember making this all the time decades ago & it was always a hit. I have now introduced it to my friends and neighbours here in the UK. They can't get enough of it! I stick to the recipe exactly and will keep on making it.
PS if you want an ego boost & live away from the States nothing quite works like your favourites that no one has tasted yet.

I would make it again but put in a little less brown sugar, maybe 3/4 cup.

Followed the recipe except for one addition.  I added 8 oz creme fraiche. Sweet and tangy and the perfect consistentcy for dipping.

I've made this dip several times now, and it is a huge hit every time! Everyone always asks for the recipe.  It is so quick and easy to whip up.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I've tried to cut the sugar back some, but it just isn't the same. Unfortunately, that full cup is needed! Oh well, we indulge very once in a while.

This is great!!! Had a lot of cream cheese to use up and after doing a search, decided to try this recipe. Yummy as is-will try with yogurt next time as someone suggested just to try and make it a little healthier, although this certainly isn't for health buffs.

A perfect treat if you're having a sweet tooth.  I only needed a bit for myself, so I mixed 1 oz of cream cheese, 1 oz of brown sugar and just a tiny bit of vanilla.  It was so sweet and yummy and perfect with strawberries.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. Will use clear vanilla extract next time because it turned out brown.
