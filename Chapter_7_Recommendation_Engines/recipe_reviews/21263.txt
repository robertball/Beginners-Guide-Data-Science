My family can't get enough of this, I made it for Thanksgiving and had to make it for twice since then!  My any changes is adding celery, 2 tsp sage and rosemary and lightly toasting the bread before mixing with the other ingredients.  Otherwise, fantastic!  I have used this several times to make stuffed porkchops and with a pork crown roast.

I tend to try a new stuffing recipe every year. I have made many stuufings from fruit ones to the ordinary sage cornbread kind. But I'll tell you something, I tried this one for the first time this year. Next year I am going to use the same one. This is the best dressing ever, all I did to alter it was add about 2 tablespoons of sage. otherwise it is perfect and the only one I will use in years to come.

If you’re a traditional bread stuffing purist don’t try this, especially on Thanksgiving when you don’t want to take any chances!   I was after something different tonight and this was it.   Green peppers in stuffing was a first for me.  So was bacon.  And this was the first time I did not add a beaten egg.  Rather than boiling the vegetables, bacon and sausage, I browned the meats and sweated the vegetables.    I added the warmed broth to the combined ingredients.  I used about 1/3 less of the spices called for which proved to be a good call for us.  Bottom line?  Eh –nice to try, but not a repeat for us.  There was so much going on with this stuffing that the “bread” part of bread stuffing was lost.  Two stars from Hubs, and I’m being generous with my three.

I did not care for this recipe. It is a good thing I had several other side dishes. This is definately not worth the work or effort for me.

My boyfriend and I have been making this recipe for the last four Thanksgivings and it is  invariably the star course! We've even made this as the main dish for dinners.   Very filling and delicious! Thank you, Mr Szaller!  Update (6/7/09): Just to add that almost five years later, my now-husband and I still love this recipe. It is an integral part of our Thanksgiving meal!

never liked stuffing, as a child, until I had it with sausage. this recipe (peppers omitted but parsley and chantrelles added) was divine, and was even better than the original dish that won my heart as a kid! a definite keeper, and permanent presence for my future turkey dinners

I just made this recipe for the 3rd Thanksgiving in a row.  I have never rec'd so many compliments, and for a stuffing recipe, who would have thought.  I don't alter a thing.  It is very flavorful & filling.  Even if I don't host Thanksgiving, I have been asked to provide the stuffing, this recipe.  Can't say enough about it, thanks!!!

This was different from any I have ever had.  However, it fit right in with my southern/cajun family style.  It was an excellent addition.  It was also my first time making the stuffing so I'm proof it's a doable recipe.

Delish!! Just loved this stuffing! Did all the prep work the day before Thanksgiving and cooked it up for one hour, stirred it to mix the crunchy parts around and cooked it for 15 more mins.  Added Celery and 1 Tblsp sage, toasted my bread first! Yummy

I always skip not only making stuffing but also skip consuming stuffing that others make as its not my favorite. This thanksgiving, I decided to give it a shot and used this recipe, and much to the delight of everyone at the table, it was a HIT! Even with my teenagers! Who doesn't agree that bacon makes everything better? The flavor is like no other stuffing I've had! The reason I give it 4 not 5 stars is because it does take a lot of prep, dirty pans and time. I would suggest preparing all but the bread a day ahead and then add the bread the day of baking to keep it from getting soggy. I also used chicken broth and drippings from the turkey instead of water.

The recipe itself is very good. With a crying newborn, I threw in all the stock and of course that was way too much! Oh well, I baked it uncover the whole time and just ate the crunchies on top...lol I will make this again of course with a little tweeking here and there.

Delicious!!!! One of my sons was present just after I made it, he took a bite and went for more!  And he does not even like dressing very much.  So when he says it is delicious, it is delicious!!!!

I made this recipe with some modifications. First, I did not use celery salt since I did not have that at hand. I wish I would have added chopped celery. Second, I used half the order of bread and half of jiffy corn bread. The reason I used jiffy corn bread was because I thought the dish was a bit salty, so I used corn bread to sweeten it up some. I toasted the bread and sprinkled in some sage. I also added 1 more cup of water to really soak the dish. I used my hands to mix the ingredients well. I liked it. Depending on how big a hit it is tomorrow, I'll think about doing this recipe again.

I substituted Creole seasoning for the seasoning salt, everything else is as directed. One person at Thanksgiving dinner  and myself thought it was the best we had ever eaten.  It will be my go to recipe from now on!

fantastic, I tend to use a little less sausage and an extra slice of bacon and 3 green/red peppers but I think this dish is great.  The family loves it and I am required to make it every major holiday.

i made this recipe as written, except i diced up some celery and added some regular salt instead of using celery salt. i also used minced, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. as i was making this i thought that basil was an unusual choice for the recipe, and i think that was what made my wife and i hate it. my wife said it smelled like pizza and it did. i just didn't like it. i'm giving the recipe 2 stars instead of 1 because my side of the family loved. they described it as wonderful and savory. if they ever make the recipe; they can give it more stars. i do have one compliment; this stuffing looked great and was the visual highlight of our thanksgiving table.
