I had a ton of fresh cherry tomatoes and basil to use up from my garden--and I'm so glad I chose this recipe to do so! This is an amazing pasta dish! Simple, fresh ingredients come together to make a flavorful sauce that is almost too good to be true! The only minor 'issue' is that the recipe has you make the pasta fairly early on in the cooking process--I would actually not do that, and wait until closer to the end, when the sauce is about done. Other than that, make it as-is, and you'll be in for a truly wonderful meal!

I loved this recipe.  It could use a little more ingredients.  It's mostly pasta in the end.  Adding some other veggies might be nice.  I'm going to experiment with this recipe  at a later date.

Easy and tasty! Hold off on cooking the pasta until your tomatoes are roasted and ready for the sauce. I didn't let the tomatoes and garlic cool before mashing. I used a clean towel to squeeze the hot garlic over the roasted tomatoes.
