I have a profound distaste for mayonnaise, so when I saw this recipe for a milk-based version of one of my favorite dressings, I had to try it.  I was not let down, this has a fabulous flavor.  One drawback to using milk instead of mayo is the consistency.  The dressing was a little runny.  I also went a little overboard on the anchovies.  To remedy two problems with one solution, I grated some parmesan cheese in.  Wonderful and easy, a new favorite!

Next time I will omit the salt.  The anchovies are salty enough.

This dressing is great! The only changes I made were adding black pepper, chives (because I had them), and sour cream to thicken it. Eating it on a salad with sprouts, sunflower seeds and blue cheese. Delicious!

Have to be honest, I've never had green goddess dressing before.  As suggested by a reviewer, I did add a little parmesan to thicken, and the consistency was fine.  It just could be that I wouldn't rave about any green goddess dressing, so no offense intended to this recipe...I thought it was just OK.

This is really delicious! and i love that it's no mayo! Everyone loved it and i'm passing on the recipe per request :) Only suggestion is add salt to taste. I orginally omitted the salt, per one of the reviews, but ended up adding some salt to taste as the anchovy paste i bought was not very salty. This is keeper! Im glad I doubled the recipe! next time i may add some parmesan or something to thicken, but the taste is there! Thank You Rinnie!

I added an equal amount of lite mayo to thicken it up.
