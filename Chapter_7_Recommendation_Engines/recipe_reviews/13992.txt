Because I like a lot of spices, I added 3/4 tsp basil, oregano and garlic, and used salsa insetad of tomato sauce.  Turned out awesome!  I couldn't stop eating it.  Will make again.

I added grated carrots to give it some colour (It's NOT colorful as stated) and I noticed that it would be bland had I followed the recipe, so I added parmesan cheese, salt, onion powder, garlic powder more pepper and used mild salsa sauce instead of tomato 
sauce and topped it off with more cheese.  When I took it out of the oven I thought I may have under baked it so I put it in longer but to my disappointment the Zucchini Bake is mushy ( not under baked !).  I thought it would be solid and that it could be sliced into wedges and served, but it was mushy. Acually, it looked like seasoned oatmeal. not very presentable. And definitly not "a colorful Vegetable casserole" as stated! It tasted good, my 6 year old liked it but I will not make again.

This was terrible.  It had virtually no flavor at all.  Maybe next time, I'll try adding a lb of sausage, but that's if I can convince my husband to let me make it again.

This was really excellent.  I felt like the serviing suggestion is skimpy though.  Next time I'm going to double it up.  I served it for breakfast and everyone really enjoyed the combination of zucchini and oatmeal.  I added more egg substitute then indicated and salsa instead of plain tomato sauce.  The oatmeal and zucchini really make an interested combination - I could think of lot's of ways to change this around as a side dish to a potluck or for a breakfast brunch.

I picked this recipe to feed my toddler and took a taste and thought it tasted good.  I doubled the tomato sauce and cut the finished product into bars and froze individually.  This makes multiple meals for my toddler.  Next time I will add more oats only to make it a little more solid, to make it more of a hand held snack.  Thanks.

Bland as is, but after adding some salt and serving with ketchup or salsa (or some hot peppers, perhaps?) it was improved greatly.

No one would take a second bite of it.  It did not look very nice either. We did not like this recipe. Sorry.

I used my very first zucchini from my very first garden to make this. It was a little blah but was a nice side dish for Chicken Parmigiana. Next time I will definitely add ground beef or sausage and some additional spices. Overall, I would make this again.

Really enjoyed this, something totally different than I've made before. I added more cheese than was probably healthy, and skipped the tomato sauce as it struck me as too strong a flavor. Will make again!

flavored it up a bit...DELICIOUS.  Saute some yellow/red bell pepper w/ the onions. Added extra basil and some Italian blend. Threw in some chopped tomatoes as well. Didn't have tomato sauce so I used traditional Prego spaghetti sauce and cheddar/jack cheese instead of mozzarella.
