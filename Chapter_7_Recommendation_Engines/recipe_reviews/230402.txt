I used a homemade baking mix and homemade spiced apple butter in this recipe. I did add one more tablespoon of the apple butter I was kind of confused as to why there was only one tablespoon in the whole recipe and why it was there until I figured out that it must be replacing the fat that would normally be in a pancake recipe. I served these with homemade maple-vanilla pancake syrup. These pancakes cooked up nice and fluffy and were the perfect consistancy it's just that the ginger was a little too much for us. I don't want to downrate the recipe because I know that the submitter meant for the pancakes to be that way it was just a little too much for us. I will make these again only I would cut back on the ginger some.

You are so right about the aroma-the made my house smell wonderful this morning. We enjoyed the recipe and I only used about half of the spices-we're sometimes not daring in the morning. They were a great take on a traditional breakfast that we love.
