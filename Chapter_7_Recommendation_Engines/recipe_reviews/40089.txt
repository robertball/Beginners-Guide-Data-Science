Fixed this tonite as a hamburger steak & served with 4 cheese rice for hubby, cottage cheese for me & pickled beets for both.  Broiled the patties in the convection oven.  It turned out great & we both loved it.  Also, the meal was very kind to my diabetes.  Will be sure to have it again.

I ended up marinating these for an hour. We really like the flavor but they weren't any juicier than reg burgers.

These were just ok for me. They were not any juicer than my regular burgers, and I didn't really notice any special flavor in them other than just a hint of the beer. Thanks.

This is my favorite hamburger recipe by far. The flaver is really great. I haven't grilled these yet but I'm sure they'll be great then too. 
Edit - I have made this at least five times since my previous review and have made other hamburger recipes. This is still the best, haven't even tweaked the recipe!

The burgers are very good but they tend to fall apart on the grill.  Rather than marinade them in the juice mixture, I added 1/4 cup of it to the beef and added a slightly beaten egg and some bread crumbs to keep them together on the grill.

Real good and I thought they were juicy.  I used onion powder instead of onion salt and added just a pinch of regular salt.

This burger didn't do it for me.  I am not a beer drinker and that is all I could taste.  My recently turned 21 year old did enjoy it.  Had a litttle trouble keeping the burger together while grilling.  I think it was from sitting in the marinade.  I will try this again - adding the ingredients I do when making my burgers and then soak it in marinade.

Made as per recipe, we found no improvement in juciness or flavor over our usual burgers, so I added the leftover marinade to more ground beef, formed patties and chilled for about an hour.  These were somewhat more moist and had more flavor, but still didn't impress.  Thank you anyway Caliboo.

I made this recipe using Coors Light because that's all we had in the fridge. Had the butcher ground some sirloin for the patties and marinated them longer than called for - about an hour. They came out so deliciously juicy. Me and my boyfriend were impressed. Will be making these again with a better quality beer.

With all the rave reviews, I thought this would be much better than what my family ate. I think it's because I didn't use the onion salt and used some chopped onion instead, which made the burger not seasoned enough. I'll definitely make sure I generously season next time. However, they were indeed very juicy!

I thought it was alright but, I of course used 90% lean meat so that could possibly be why I didn't think it was all that great.

I made these because I was looking for a different flavor in a grilled burger. This seemed simple and I had all the ingredients. However, I didnt really like it that much. The patties fall apart and were hard to work with, while the burgers didnt really seem to taste much different than just plain on the grill.

For our recent cookout, we prepared half of our burgers with this method and half without the beer. They all turned out good but neither were juicier than the other. I also had trouble tasting the beer in it. Next time I think we'll just omit the beer and add some cheese instead.

Made this recipe three separate times.  Last night I did a side by side comparison of my usual recipe vs. this one.  The other patty was made using dry ingredients and turned out more juicy than the patty that only had the marinade.

The burgers started to partially disintegrate after about 20 minutes. The flavours were okay and yes the burgers were moist but I don't think that I would make them again

I have no idea why but this works, but it definitely does the trick.  When I made it the second time, I replaced the water, salt, and pepper with Worchestershire sauce and Montreal steak seasoning and added an extra 1/2 tsp. of salt.  It was even better the second time.

This burger definitely lives up to its name. Other than switching out onion salt for onion powder it is perfect as written.

Not very juicy. And the flavors were definitely missing something, some sort of kick.
