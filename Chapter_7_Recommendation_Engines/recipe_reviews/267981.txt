Good healthy cookie. I added 2 tbs of ground flax and 2 tbs and chia seeds. I also added 1/2 cup of flour. Still came out chewy and amazing. 

Thanks,

I doubled the oats.  Yummy soft cookie! Going to make again and again. Might add some dried cherries next time.

2.12.19  If you’e looking for a crispy cookie, move on.  I baked these for 14 minutes, and since the recipe submitter said they’d look slightly raw,  took them out of the oven, and let sit for about 15 minutes.  They’re very soft in texture and although not the prettiest cookie around,  they taste pretty darn good.  I used a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop to place them on the baking sheet, ended up with 18 cookies, and since they didn't spread out, you can place them fairly close together (all on one pan).  Not sure why the recipe calls for “instant oatmeal,” but I had one packet that had been sitting around for a while so used it, and topped off the 1/2 cup with some quick cooking oats.  If I make again, I’ll try using just the regular quick cooking oats.  It really doesn’t get much easier than this recipe to bake a few cookies.  Thanks for sharing.
