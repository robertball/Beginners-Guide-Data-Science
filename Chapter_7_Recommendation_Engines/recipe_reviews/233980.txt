Love this recipe.  You cannot taste the spinach or carrots.  When making for kids, I put in frozen cherries to make it red.

This is so delicious and my 2 and 5 year old love it...of course, I didn't tell them what was in it!  I did substitute vanilla yogurt because that is what I had on hand.

This was our first spinach smoothie experience! I have always been meaning to try it. This was a great combination of fruits and vegetables and healthy too. My husband and I both enjoyed it!

Delicious recipe. I use kale instead of spinach and half the honey. I really like this healthy shake and I get my greens all at the same time.

This was good.  I did make a few changes.. I did use carrot,spinach and banana but added strawberries and added a little 2% milk and that was it. I had my 12 year old taste it and he said he liked it.. then I told him what was in there..

I would rate this between a 3-4. My rating is higher, because it does have vegetables added to it which to me is just healthier for a meal smoothie. I don't know what I did wrong, because mine was not the pretty green color. It was the color of sand. Only change I made was making a half of a recipe, to reduce the calories. It made plenty for one person. The banana I used was also frozen. I don't typically add that much yogurt or even need sweeteners in a smoothie. Going to work with the base here, to see what I can come up with. I do not taste any fruit or even the vegetables, really, mostly just taste like liquified yogurt.

My wife and I are trying to do little changes at a time to steer away from the bad eating lifestyle that we are living with and this recipe is defiantly a great start. The first sip took some adjusting to because it wasn't the breakfast egg, cheese and sausage biscuit sandwich that we are used to, but after that it tasted better after every sip. I will defiantly be putting this down on my breakfast menu.

Love it! I did substitute half the yogurt with Almond Coconut milk for less calories and more protein. I also set my yogurt and other ingredients in the freezer for a colder smoothie.

I really enjoyed this, however, if I put the spinach in first before the ice, I have to keep mixing it to get the smoothie process started.

first time really gone for a wacky and strange idea for a smoothie. I was trying to find a new smoothie purely because I needed to get a recipe of a smoothie for food tech. I wanted something that other people would not think of doing; for example the all original plain banana smoothie which is the most common smoothie. I tested this out before I gave the recipie to my teacher and all of the family were just loving the flavours which were hitting you. it went down a treat for everyone. gr8 laxative aswell ;).  thx  gr8 smoothie

This was my first green smoothie and it was good! I used kale instead of spinach, and low-fat vanilla Greek yogurt, because I had yhem on-hand. I also added 1 tsp chia seeds for added nutrition. I will make this again.

I was a skeptic, but I found this recipe to be delightful! My children, who are 5, 3 and 1 also really enjoy it. We've made it several times now and have found that omitting the honey doesn't change the yumminess factor at all. Also, we add milk so that we can sip them through a straw!

Instead of Yogurt and Ice, I use water.  I also add at least half of a Granny Smith Apple and some "frozen fruit".  Shredded carrots work best.  Sometimes I add some cinnamon and/or honey and sometimes I use kale instead of spinach or I use a mixture of both.  I mix all of this in my Nutri-Bullet and refrigerate over night.  I have been making these for over 2 years now.  Love it.

I replaced ice with lo cal coconut milk. I made it cold by freezing the ingredients.
I know it reads like a different recipe,  yet this was the first healthy smothie I ever made and All credit should go to the author because it was a great start to a regiman that I hope helps me lose weight!

Just tried this.  Used greek strawberry yogurt.  I think it was too sweet with honey.  Next time I'll make without honey and it should be perfect.

I just made this for an after workout snack and loved it!  I changed the recipe a bit by skipping the honey and adding a little bit of cinnamon.  I also used light blueberry greek yogurt.  Turned out delicious!

I love this recipe. I kept thinking that it was going to taste so green. But you really don't taste the carrot or spinach. Its really good and fulling. Plus its actually fun to make. Its one of my first times trying a green and healthy smoothie.

This is a great and refreshing smoothie recipe. The ingredients were frozen so I added a little water (about 1/2 - 1 cup) to loosen the mixture. Otherwise, I followed the instructions to the T! Great recipe thanks for sharing.

I made it but made some changes after reading the reviews. I put 1 cup spinach & 1 cup kale instead of 2 cups spinach. I also lowered the yogurt amount to 3 tablespoons and added 1 scoop protein powder and a piece of ginger. It tasted AMAZING!! It had the right amount of sweetness to it and i could taste the banana and a little bit of the carrot. I will definitely continue making it!!??????????

Made with spinach and a it was nice. Made with spinach and strawberries and was nice, just more strawberry like taste. Made with kale and tasted like grass. Made with kale and strawberries and tasted a bit less grassy. Maybe add honey with kale smoothie. 

Used normal spinach as I didn't have babie spinach and plain yogurt. 

I did not use honey. Used 1 c milk instead of ice.
It was chunky as my blender could not fully chop raw carrots.
Next time will add 2Tbs ground flax seeds. Can use any yogurt I have, flavoured or not. Maybe add cinnamon as suggested. May also add frozen peaches as suggested. It may make it tastier? If I have chia I will use as suggested (protein, calcium, omega 3 & magnesium. May add other frozen berries next time.

It was really really good.  I did add 2 tablespoons of Agave!  My significant other he is so picky and dislikes vegetables so the only way I can get him to eat them is wonderful smoothies like this one.  He loved this one!!!!!  I loved this one!!!!!!!  This is a saver.  :)

I cut the recipe in half because it was just for me and I added a scoop of chocolate whey protein (only flavor I had). Surprisingly, the chocolate was pretty good! I couldn't taste any of the veggies. I will make this again for sure!

I hadn't put the carrots in and I add all sorts - I might put a spoonful of peanut butter or ground cinnamon or a spoon of honey. I always put linseed in as it's great for adding fibre.
