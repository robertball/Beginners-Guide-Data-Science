Excellent soup for a wintery evening.  I'm one of those tiresome cooks who rarely try a recipe without making changes.  Well, most of the time I don't have all the ingredients and all of the time, I have to avoid gluten.  So I used cheddar-brats and I substituted Progresso Creamy Mushroom Soup (gluten-free) and skipped the extra water (Progresso is not condensed, but ready-to-eat). Since I had no real potatoes in the house,  I made instant mashed potatoes and ladled the soup over it.  If it's thick enough, my "I hate soup" fussy teen assumes it's a casserole.  We both liked it, and noticed that the thick sauce and mashed potatoes held the heat very well, a plus for winter fare.  Said fussy teen just asked for another helping!

I loved this soup/stew, it was even better on day 2. Like others, I added chicken stock instead of water and I am pretty sure this made a big difference. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again!

This was really good, though I did make a couple of changes. I added cheddar cheese soup, and swapped the water for beef broth. One thing I will do next time is wait to add the canned green beans, they got a kinda mushy cooking that long.

Surprisingly good.  We had extra brats & the rain prevented grilling.  The only thing I changed is I did not add green beans.

I made a double batch of this for the family and they loved it.  In fact my father-in-law wants it to be in the rotation of meals we serve at home.  I tweaked it a little bit with adding garlic and some other spices but for the most part I stuck to the recipe and it is a definite keeper.

I will definitely make this again. I'm new at cooking, but my husband absolutely loved it. It's so savory and it's so easy! Just plop all the ingredients in a crock pot and let it cook and  voil√†! It's ready. I highly recommend this recipe!

I had leftover venison brats that the kids didn't particularly like so I was looking for a recipe to use them.  This recipe was perfect.  They loved it.  I liked that it was easy to make and easy to adjust to the ingredients I had on hand.  I used the venison brats and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and cut up white potatoes.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I cooked it on the stove and cooked the potatoes in the microwave before adding to the stew to save time.

This was great but it needed more liquid. I made as written but then added chicken broth all along the way until I got it to that perfect consistency. Super simple and full of flavor but it just needs thinned down some in my opinion. The end result was very pretty and had a nice rich broth.

This was great.  It was easy to make and tasty.  I took someone's advice and added chopped kale.  I also didn't have raw potatoes and subbed tater tots and 1 sweet potato.  I used cheddar and parmesan cheeses.  Can you tell I was cleaning out the fridge for Thanksgiving?
