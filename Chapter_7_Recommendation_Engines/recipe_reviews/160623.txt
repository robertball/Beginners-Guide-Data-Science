We love potato salad and though we have our favorites are always on the look out for something new.  This was pretty good, but I would go with dill pickle or relish in place of the cucumber for a little added flavor.  Also, I like to add a little paprika for the color.  I think I would also use a red onion or green onions just because the yellow onion I used was really potent, could be I added a little to much, but the onion flavor was very strong.  Thanks so much for sharing.

So simple, especially if you have some left over potatoes to use up!  I omitted the tomato and used pickles instead of cucumber.  None the less, this was a welcome easy recipe to make.

I really like this potato salad with a little tweaking. I left out the tomato and added celery salt, garlic salt and dried dill. It is even quicker if you already have hard boiled eggs on hand. Definitely stands up to all those "non-quick" potato salads!

If you want to make it 'quick' - use red or golden potatoes.  You don't have to peel them.
Also, the tomatoes, cucumber, and 'over kill' with the onions weren't very appealing.

Fabulous!  I modified it somewhat using less onion (since it upsets my husband's stomach) and added sweet relish, dill and paprika.

I scaled this down, for smaller portions. It was great, minus an ingredient or two. It really HAS to be tweaked. Cucumber is interesting, but I prefer pickles or relish. More flavor than a tasteless cucumber. I substituted pimentos for tomatoes. Do not prefer celery- omitted that. And used all diced onion instead of green onions.  Good recipe, but I think some things need to be adjusted or replaced.

Difficult for me to rate, as I used this as a basis for some thrown together potato salad. I didn't have half of the listed ingredients and added more spices. The end result was absolutely delicious.

So this is great for inspiration, and next time I might try the actual recipe. :)

We love this recipe too. Made it with Crock-Pot corn on the cob. My   boyfriend said it tasted just like the potato salad that his  Aunt Mrs Dee used to make. That's a GREAT compliment!

I was missing the onion and celery, but this still turned out really good. I will make it again and put some bacon in it!

Loved it.  Followed what other reviews recommended (replaced cucumber with dill pickles, used red onion. I also added an additional potato and egg), and my picky husband loved it.  We ate it freshly warm and chilled --- both were delicious.  The fresh vegetables added a nice crunch to it.
