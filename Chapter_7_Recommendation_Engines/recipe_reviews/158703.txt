Well, I just got up from the table after fixing this for dinner, and it was just superb! We don't get nice large pork loins around here, but we get the 2-in-a-pack type with the both of them weighing about 2-1/2 to 3 pounds. I prepared both of them, using 8 strips of bacon to do so. As recommended below, I quadrupled the sauce (1/2 cup each of honey, balsamic and red wine, 1 large yellow onion and 2 teaspoons dried rosemary) and doubled the raisins (1/4 cup). I basted at 15- and 30 minutes then added the raisins. It took another 25 minutes to finish it to 160Â° for a total cooking time of 55 minutes. Served 4 medallions each with broccoli and cheesy noodles and had enough to serve 6 or 7. Comment from the guest: "This would cost $50 at a good New York restaurtant...and you'd get only 3 medallions!"

This was really good. It might be helpful to know that you cook 15 minutes per pound or to 160 degrees. I used wrights applewood bacon and used 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup of balsmic vinegar and 1/2 cup of honey. 1 lg. yellow onion and 1 tablespoon of fresh rosemary. I left off the raisins. The night before I seasoned pork loin with salt and pepper and browned in iron skillet and covered with the sauce to let marinate over night. I used my pamper chef roaster, without foil. It took my 4 pd. loin about and hour and 15 minute. Put remaining sauce in gravy dish for individual use. Served with scalloped potatoes and Foo Foo salad.    USE HEMOSTATS OR NEEDLE NOSE PLYERS FOR REMOVING TOOTHPICKS.I USED STATS AND IT WAS VERY EASY TO DO.

Unfortunately I was disappointed with this recipe.  After the baking time of 30 minutes, the roast wasn't even close to being done.  I had to cook another 15 minutes then finally microwave it (yikes!) because the family was starving!  The sauce didn't add anything to the roast.  I had high hopes as I love everything in the sauce, but all it did was make a huge blackened mess in the pan, as I don't think any of it stayed on the roast.  The only saving grace was the bacon - what isn't made better with bacon? I won't be making this again.

The best Pork Loin roast I have ever made or eaten! I used 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 red wine, 3 tbs of balsamic vinegar, 3 tbs of olive oil, 1 tbs maple syurp put over the top just before baking. After browing the roast in the frying pan. I put all other ingredients in skillet and brought to a boil and poured over the roast and refrigerated for 2 hrs and basting every 1/2 hr. when baking I basted it every 15 min. I kept it covered for the first 1/2 hour. I can't wait to make this one again!!

I really, really enjoyed this. I made about triple the amount of sauce (but just one large onion) and I think next time I'll make even more. I used boneless pork chops and cooked for about 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven, basting every 15 minutes and turning once halfway through cooking. Great submission, thank you! Oh, and no raisins for me. 

Update: EVEN BETTER the next day. Next time I'll marinate the pork in the sauce overnight first.

This was delicious!  Only changes I made...I doubled the sauce and added a splash of red wine.  I marinated for about 4 hours.  I seared in my dutch oven,removed the pork, deglazed with the marinade, put the pork back in and scooped sauce over top of it.  I cooked with the lid on the dutch oven for 1 hour.  That's how long it took for mine to be done.  Was very good!  Thanks for a great recipe! SAFETY TIP: Count the toothpicks you put in because when it's done they are kind of hidden!

This recipe was great...the pork was very moist the bacon crisp and the sauce delicious.   The only tweak I would make next time  would be to cover with foil for the first 30 minutes (this takes at least 45 minutes to an hour to cook...NOT 30 minutes) because the sauce got a little too brown. Also, wait longer to add the raisins...they were hard as rocks.

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this recipe but I had a pork loin roast in my freezer from angelfoodministries.com that I wanted to use and I'd never cooked one before. I did an ingredient search and found this recipe.  I had to substitute red wine vinegar for the balsamic vinegar and red wine because I don't keep those on hand. I also had no rosemary so I substituted Italian seasoning. Also I left out the raisins...and WOW, it was SO good!  My entire family ate it and liked it, which is very unusual around here. My 3 and 6 year old daughters kept cleaning their plate, then pushing it toward me saying "More please!" Unbelievable!  I actually thought it was very simple to make. One thing I will suggest is that before you slice it, move it to a slicing platter or you'll end up with aluminum foil bits all over your roast. I think the most difficult part of the recipe was taking the toothpicks out. lol. GREAT recipe; I will make this again!

This was tasty.  I used white instead of red wine--mainly because this was what I had open.  I also used my cast iron grill top for the sear.  I'd love to try this on the grill.  My hubby loved this--porky goodness is always a hit in our house.  I did use some extra white wine to keep the glaze liquid during roasting.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  This was the first time I ever prepared a pork loin and it turned out great.  I went ahead and used the half cup suggestion and white wine that several other reviews suggested and I'm glad I did.  There is no way 2 tablespoons of each would've been enough to keep the loin juicy and tender.  I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND A MEAT THERMOMETER FOR THIS RECIPE. I left the loin in the oven for the recommended 45 minutes that I saw in several reviews and was very shocked when I started cutting into the loin and the majority of it was still pink.  I would recommend string instead of toothpicks to hold the bacon on. When I tried to brown the loin in a pan the bacon did not stay put very well.  I basted every 15 minutes and the loin was so juicy and tender. I plan on using this recipe again! Oh and I DID NOT use raisins. That just sounded terrible.

this was great.  I opted out on the raisins which my family does not like.  It did require a little longer cook time, but overall wonderful.  Will definitely fix again

I sliced my tenderloin into 1inch rounds, wrapped it with turkey bacon (instead of pork) and used toothpicks to attach it. I only made 3 of these, approx .5 lb of pork loin since its just my husband and I. I doubled the sauce recipe except for the onion and added 3tbs total of brown sugar. I also decided to use it as a meranade instead of just baking the meat in the sauce. I made sure both sides of the meat was covered in the spices and onions while marinading in the fridge for about 6 hours. While the meat was baking I also basted the sauce over it every twenty min or so after flipping it each time. After being baked in the oven for about an hour on 350, it was SO tender and sweet tasting. The turkey bacon absorbed the sweetness of the sauce/meranade, I wasn't expecting that!

This was a very good dish that I will make again.  I used more bacon than called for just because we like it and I had it.  I also did not have red wine so I used white instead but the flavor was still good.  Had to use dried herbs instead of fresh b/c of what I had on hand but next time I think I will try fresh b/c I am sure it will make it even better.  I put a bit too much of the dried on so it was a little over powering.  Definitely use a meat therm. b/c the time to cook is not accurate.  2nd time:  Used 12 oz package of bacon to cover two small tenderloins.  Had red wine to use.  I do not use the raisins b/c I hate them!  I consistently overcook pork so really need to watch the temperature.

This was absolutely amazing!!  I did tweek it a little and used maple syrup and no balsamic (I hate vinegar).  I cut my 4lb pork loin into 4 sections before wrapping it with bacon.  Before I put the meat in the oven I drizzled a little honey on top of the meat and then poured the sauce mix on top.  I basted it a few times while it cooked.  Definately use a meat thermometer though to determine whether it is done or not.  This was so good.  It's definately a keeper of a recipe and I cannot wait to make it again

I think this recipe needs to specify whether it means "pork loin" or "pork tenderloin".  From reading the comments, I think some people are confused and that is why some of the cooking times have been longer than expected.  

Made this today with pork loin and it turned out delicious.  Took about an hour plus a bit to roast a 2-3 pound loaf.

I was so looking forward to these! .....But was very disappointed! Too much overpowering vinegar taste and very bland! I do , however, like how the bacon wraps around the loin, and will attempt to use this on individual pork loin chops and bake them without the onion/balsamic vinegar topping.

This was delicious, may try marinating next time.  I loved the reduction it made.  I soaked the raisins in boiling water to plump them up before baking, and used a tent of foil.  They were perfect, not dried up or hard.  Served it with BREAKSTONE'S Curried Mashed Sweet Potatoes from this site.

I didn't think this recipe outstanding, I really felt it was missing something but my kids all loved it.  And pleasing all of them (21, 8 & 6) with one dish is not an easy thing so I will give this a 4*.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the raisins (they aren't available here).  I did use an immersion blender on the sauce and covered the pan for the majority of the cooking.  As a result the sauce did not burn to the bottom and I was able to continuously baste it.  While I am not a raisin fan, perhaps thats the flavor I was missing?  We will be making it again since the kids loved it so much and really it wasn't bad at all.

This was really good!  I doubled the glaze (except for the onion) and left out the rosemary just cause I didn't have any.  I did NOT pre-brown because I couldn't find my toothpicks so had to use metal meat nails.  I did use the broiler on low for the last few minutes, but next time I would put under the broiler first, without adding the glaze, to brown the bacon, and then add the glaze.  My 1.5 lb. loin took about 50 minutes to cook thoroughly.  I could see doing this without the bacon (because the glaze was delish!).

This is my favorite recipe to do on the rotissere. I inject the loin with a mesquite marinade and let it roll. I try to keep heat around 350 and start checking internal temp after an hour. I pull it out a few degrees early as it will still cook a bit. Always a big hit. And it dont need baby sat, so more time to mingle.

Easy to make and tasted great! Made the whole house smell like holiday cooking. Good for a large crowd. I also tripled the ingredients for marinade, which left sauce to spoon over pork when serving. Yummy!

This was a great hit with my family. I did make changes due to a lack of my pantry. I used white cooking wine and marjoram instead of red wine and rosemary. I also left out the raisins. The loin turned out so moist and tender that hubby with no teeth was wowed.

So different from our other Pork Loin recipes.  I was very leery of using balsamic vinegar (seems so strong) & rosemary from past experience. USE the balsamic vinegar because it doesn't over power. I don't usually have fresh rosemary so ground up some dried rosemary & used a lot less than you would for fresh (Joy of Cooking book comparisons).  Didn't use the golden raisins as they were optional & are expensive.  Our only problem was in the baking time.  IT took closer to 45 min to bake a 1 1/2lb loin.  Everything else was ready before the pork loin was.  Will make again for sure.

This was so delicious!! I just shared this recipe with my parents because I know they would love to try this, too! I didn't have all the correct ingredients on hand, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because I'm sure the recipe as written is a winner, too. I used a smaller pork loin from Trader Joe's, it was about 1.4 pounds. I only had Riesling white wine on hand, a red onion (used 1/3 of it), dried rosemary, and I chopped up a 1/2 an apple to substitute for the raisins. I doubled, if not tripled the sauce ingredients. I browned the pork and bacon in my cast iron skillet and then just kept it in the skillet, poured the sauce over the top and put the skillet into the oven. It was so good! I can't wait to make it again when we have company!

Followed directions and added a few steps of my own. Used a 3 1/2 lbs. pork loin. I tripled the glaze and injected the pork loin with part of glaze and used maple bacon instead of regular bacon. Cooking string is a must!
 This recipe was amazingly easy and taste wonderful, pork was tender and juicy. First time making a pork loin and will definitely make again!

This was delicious and so simple! I made a few changes such as doubling the sauce and wrapping it in prosciutto instead of bacon. I also omitted the raisins because I didn't have any.

Seriously? I have the world's most pickiest kids & they asked for not only 2nds but 3rds, 4ths & 5th servings of this! I used oregano instead of rosemary b/c I didn't want to go to the store again. And doubled the sauce to keep it moist. Also used normal raisins. I paired w/ sweet potatoe casserole & asparagus w/ hollidase sauce & crescents. They ate moire of this than anything! Awesome dish!!!

This is a keeper for sure. Took some hints from the comments but followed the recipe for the most part. I went straight into the roaster with the roast S&P and bacon..........started it out at 375 while I made the sauce. Used Maple Syrup instead of honey but other than that stuck to the recipe. Poured that over the roast and turned the heat down to 325 and cooked till the thermometer reached 145 basting a few times. Took it out and tented it till the rest of the meal was done. It was very tasty and juicy, the sauce did not dry out on the pan for me........I might try starting it at 400 next time just to crisp up the bacon a little more, but other than that this one is worthy of trying out on my biggest critic.......my Mom ;)

Awesome!  Followed recipe except for used loin chops (which is what I had on hand)  and nixed the raisins (but next time will add them in to see what I think).  This tasted like a million dollar dish!  Thanks for sharing.

Lamb was used in the place of pork. I marinated the meat over night then wrapped in bacon before cooking. We enjoyed this. No raisins used for my taste.

I used 1/2 cup honey, vinegar, and wine, and marinated the pork in it all day before wrapping with bacon. I also chopped up some Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted them in the sauce with the pork. Forgot the raisins, and it came out great!

This is delicious as is but I am going to make a few adjustments for next time. Definitely put some foil in the bottom of the pan because the sauce leaves a nasty crust that is hard to clean. Also, I am going to poke some holes in the loin next time so that the yummy sauce will go down instead of being wasted on the bottom. I use precooked bacon and put it on after the sear but this time it was a little burnt on top so next time, I am going to cover for the first part of cooking. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for Christmas since I figured I'm not the greatest cook but bacon always makes it better.  Dead silence around the table until my stepmother said, "omg this is the best pork I've ever had....are those raisins?!"
This was a huge hit and a relatively easy recipe....and that's coming from someone who breaks out boxed mashed potatoes yet is married to a phenomenal cook.
I didn't change anything with the original recipe.  great as is.

Great recipe. I tweaked it a bit as I don't like raisins with meat. I marinated the pork in the sauce over night. Before cooking I slivered 3 cloves of garlic and inserted them into small slices I made in the pork. wrapped with the bacon, browned and roasted uncovered at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. YUM!

No changes to the recipe.  Doubt I will make it again however.  Messy clean up in spite of the foil - perhaps two layers of foil would make a difference.  It took much longer to bake than expected although it was only a 2.3# loin.

Cooked a little longer, till 160 degrees. I used half cup of the liquid ingredients and basted towards the end of cooking. Then put the drippings and onions into a gravy dish for pouring over meat once on the plates. I will use less rosemary next time as it overpowered just a bit. Served with fried rice, peas , applesauce and cheese and herb crostini. Delish!!

I have been cooking for 60 years. The times on the recipe are not realistic.  It took over an hour to reach the desired temperature and by then it was burnt black on the outside.   The sauce was no longer liquid.  I cannot imagine that your test kitchen made such a horrid error.  I do not recommend this to anyone.

Delicious recipe!  The leftovers were just as good several days later. I followed other reviewers suggestions of increasing the sauce by 4 times, which did make the leftovers flavorful and moist. I wrapped it in prosciutto thinking it would b easier than bacon, but I donât think it helped. I did have trouble finding the toothpicks as others commented; do count how many you use. I would serve this to company anytime.

Absolutely delicious.  I used a dutch oven to brown and cook in the oven and it only took 30-45 min.  I would double the sauce. It's so good and just not enough.  Didn't have any golden raisins so used regular and they were delicious, wouldn't leave them out.  Golden raisins would be even sweeter.  Can't wait to make it again.

Husband loved it! I forgot the salt & pepper! I wrapped it in bacon, tied w/ string, browned in cast iron pan. I put the honey onion mix in the food processor for a few pulses to bring it together and then on top of roast . 375F for 1 hour uncovered.

Quick and simple to prepare. It tasted great served with rice and veggies. I would recommend using thinner bacon as the thick cut is more difficult to wrap.
Don't skimp on the bacon!!

Delicious and different mix of flavors! Added garlic into small slits in the pork for an extra one we enjoy.

Not sure how you got this to originally finish cooking after only 30 min @ 375. Mine took almost an hour.

I joined this group just to rate this recipe, it was that good.   I used a 1.5 lb. loin and did cook it for an hour, to 160 degrees, but the sauce was spot-on.  Browned it in oven safe skillet, then cooked, covered the whole time, in the oven.  At 15 minutes left, I flipped it over and moved it around in the pan to loosen up and stir the sauce, and give the other side time to crisp up the bacon.  It was so tender.

My husband keeps repeating, â I love it! I love itâ over and over! It was moisture, succulent, and full of flavor.  I did need to roast about 10 minutes longer but I used a meat thermometer and that was fine. (Probably my oven)

Big disappointment. The glaze was watery and didn't really glaze. The bacon absorbed what little flavor there was. The pork roast was not especially flavorful.  I was suspicious of the 30 minute roasting time. It actually needed an hour in the oven, by which time the onions and raisins were chewy, black chunks. It makes more sense to use the "glaze" as a marinade, and add a good bacon jam as a glaze during the last 15 minutes.

Amazing flavors! I made this for an impromptu dinner party and it was a huge hit! Our guests couldn't stop talking about how good this dish was and how all the flavors mingle together so well in it to make each bite savory and sweet. The only change we had to make was to the baking time; our pork loin was very thick, so we had to bake it for 50-55 minutes total to get it just right. 

I don't put many recipes in my "worthy of guests" collection, but this one just made it in there for sure!

This was amazing! I definitely used more then 8 strips of bacon so my 2 1/2 lb pork loin was completely covered. I used Marsala wine for the sauce because thatâs what I had, as well as scallions instead of shallots. I skipped the raisins and cooked for 40 minutes. It was PERFECT! Will make again and again - thanks for the great recipe!

Really good but needed to cook longer than the recipe indicated. I left out the red wine, used less rosemary and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic.  Pork was tender and juice with good flavor.

Browning the bacon with all my toothpicks was more difficult than I expected and it took longer than the ten minutes.  I used corn syrup in place of honey and I think the honey would have been better.  Took longer to cook than suggested, even though I only used a 1 lb pork loin. It was delicious when it was done.  I will make it again!

A good rule of thumb for me cooking for a fussy hubby is if I try a recipe and then he asks for it again, it's a keeper!!  This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't use any raisins the first time around, but this time I think I may try using some craisins, just to see what that adds..

Very delicious pork tenderloin recipe.  I prepared exactly as written and my family raved!!   One thing to note, my 2.5 lb loin took about an hour to roast to 145 degrees.  Otherwise, it's a perfect recipe!!

I had to double the amounts for the sauce. It was very tasty, but looked rather hideous. There were burnt-looking black bits floating around in clear liquid like the balsamic separated from the rest of the mixture. I only used half of a medium onion and that was enough. Even though I love cooking with onion and put it in nearly everything I make, I would probably forego it next time. The onion bits that sat on top of the meat dried out in the oven and they didn't seem to add much to the dish overall. This is a really good dish. It just needs a few tweaks to make it great. 

P.S. The cooking time was spot on for the size of meat I had. The recipe says to check with a thermometer. A review shouldn't give a bad rating just because larger pieces of meat were used and had to cook longer than recommended.

Much more tasty than I expected! Not really crazy about Rosemary but this recipe was delicious. Tripled the sauce and basted every 15 minutes. Took about an hour cooking time for an average sized pork loin.

Amazing.  My family said it was one of their all time favorites!  Very tender and juicy.  Only changes:  no raisins and I quadrupled the sauce except still using one onion.  My loin however did take quite a bit longer to cook and it was a 2 and 3/4 pound loin.  I did cover with foil while baking and I used a meat thermometer and took out of oven as soon as it hit 145 degrees then let it rest for about 15 mins.

I made this without the raisins for a dinner party.  Huge success!  Everyone loved it. It was absolutely delicious. Will definitely make it again.

It seems a lot of recipes on this site confuse a pork loin (a large, boneless pork roast of 3-4 pounds) with a pork tenderloin (a small, tapering muscle of about one pound). The timing on this recipe is for a tenderloin. Cooks should adjust their timing accordingly.

Not quite as tasty as I expected. I marinated the meat in the sauce 8 hrs after wrapping in bacon and searing in a pan.  I increased the sauce ingredients substantially, adding maple syrup too, but still wished I had more for basting.   I forgot to add the raisins so maybe that would have helped make it more flavorful.  Using string to hold the bacon on was key - better than toothpicks.  Cooking time 30 minutes covered + 30 minutes uncovered worked well.

First time I ever made a pork loin like this.. I did make a lot of extra marinade like suggested and then just thickened it up at the end for an awesome gravy.

I didn't use raisins either but I added garlic.  When I cooked it, I left out covered for the first 30-40 minutes, then uncovered for the remainder of the time. It was juicy and sweet, everyone raved!

Holy cow!!  This is the best pork loin recipe that I have ever tried.  I used a smaller pork tenderloin as I am not a fan of the jumbo pork loins you see at the store. These usually come two tenderloins in one pack so I wrapped these together with the bacon. Browned it in my dutch oven then topped with wonderful tasting sauce and finished it in the oven.  I would recommend foil or lid for the first 25 min of baking to help keep the sauce from browning and drying out.  I always cook meat using a meat thermometer to insure proper cooking of meat and It did take longer than 30 min but well worth the wait.  Remember, overcooked pork is always dry.  A properly prepared pork tenderloin will be a bit pink but very juicy and tender!

This recipe was like Christmas. We sliced our onions  in skinny crescents, splashed in more vinegar and wine. Loved it.

I was excited about trying this recipe.  I was very disappointed in the roast.  I did not like the flavors.  Next time I will make a pork with a dry rub and BBQ sauce that is much better.

Made this yesterday for dinner, but cooked on the grill over indirect heat. AWESOME is the only word I can think of to describe it. My husband doesn't usually care for pork, and he had 3 big helpings. The only thing I'll change is to add the raisins later in the cooking, they got pretty hard by the time the roast was done.

Perfect.  I did add a baked apple topping for a little more "sweet" to it.  It was great, everyone loved it.
