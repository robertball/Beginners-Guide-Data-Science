This was delicious, but I made some modifications that made it even better I thought.  I added chopped tomatoes, diced onions, and feta cheese crumbles which helped balance out the strong lemon flavor.  Great summer salad!

I first placed the peeled and diced cucumber in a dish, sprinkled salt over them and left the dish in the frig for 20 minutes. Cucumbers have a lot of water so this helps bring out the juice. I then drained it before adding the mayonnaise dressing. I also added cherry tomatoes and FRESH dill weed. Just up the tablespoons to 3. Enjoy!

I used reduced fat mayonnaise and Truvia instead of sugar for a little lighter salad. I also used fresh dill weed. Very good.

Delicious, light and very tasty!  The lemon makes it very refreshing. We added wedged tomatoes and it made a very nice side dish.  Thanks!

I was attracted to this recipe because it is very similar to a dressing I use for cole slaw.  I sliced the cucumbers instead of diced, just a personal preference.  Light and delicious, will be making again.

This was pretty good. I used it for a dressing for my salmon burgers. I added some chopped green onion as well. I thought the combination of the lemon and cucumber complimented my burger well. I served with a side of spicy sweet potato fries.

Used more like 1/2 to 3/4c of low fat mayo....and also used Stevia (sugar substitute) instead of regular sugar.....loved the lemon-y zest and flavor! Also decreased the dried dill to a heaping 1 and 1/2 tspns. which was more than enough. Delicious and refeshing!

nice receipe!  English cucumbers are way to expensive for me so I just used Farm Market cucumbers.  Since they were larger, I added extra mayo and dill because I can't have enough dill!  I also put in a touch of seasoned rice vinegar to balance the sweetness and smoked paprika.  Thanks!

Awesome! The lemon offered a refreshing flavor that I really liked. I did use mostly plain yogurt, with just a bit of mayo. Really good. Thanks :)

Maybe it had too much lemon but it was sour tasting.  Probably won't make this one again...

This was pretty good but it was a little bland. Next time I will add garlic, salt, and pepper.

Used orange rind instead of lemon as that is what I had on hand. Different yet good.

I used light mayonnaise and added tomatoes and feta cheese (from reading the reviews!). My dinner guests all had a second serving- it was delicious! Great salad with grilled beef or chicken.

Either my lemon had an excessive amount of juice, or this is just too lemony!  I also added sliced cherry tomatoes and onion slices, per the photo shown with this recipe.  (The second time I made this I added a small handful of feta cheese and that really helped balance-out the lemon flavor!)

Made this for my family of four, with no changes, and not one of us liked it much, but it was edible.

I used this as a sauce for cooked zuchini, asparagus and brocoli. It was delicious and so easy to prepare!
