Good but needed more salt and pepper for flavor.  The recipe made way more filling than need for the amount of bread.

In all,  the flavor in this recipe is correct,  but the execution is terrible.  Butter will not ever blend with cucumber.  Instead,  mix the mayo with the cucumber and spread the butter on the bread.     I also like it with cucumber slices instead of chopped.

Everything was good except it seemed like there was way too many Chives, it was overpowering, so for those people who don't like Chives/Onions, you might want to use less. Otherwise is was pretty good.

I thought that this sandwich was actually very good as a summer meal.  I did implement a couple of changes.  First, I did what the other reviewers suggested and used mayo to mix with the cucumbers instead of the butter.  Second, I used garden vegetable cream cheese spread to spread on the bread.  It added a lot of flavor and worked well with the other ingredients.  I made this for my family to go along with soup and they really liked it!

We could not get the butter to blend with the cucumber either.  We thought the salt needed more time to sit with the cucumber as well.  We tried switching the butter and mayonnaise and it worked pretty well.  Very tasty!

Don't know if I did something wrong, but I couldn't get the butter to blend with the cucumbers.  Luckily, I was making two other kinds of sandwiches for my tea, as this one went in the trash.
