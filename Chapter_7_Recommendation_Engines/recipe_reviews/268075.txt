I added sweet potato, spinach and zucchini. Left out the bell pepper. Delicious. I added 1/2 more water and and would add 1/2 cup more tomato sauce to make it saucier near the end.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe. The blend of spices is mild but tasty. The potatoes make it hearty comfort food. Combining all the spices before you start is the way to go.
