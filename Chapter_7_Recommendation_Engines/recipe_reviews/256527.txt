This was a good recipe.  As you can tell, the vinegar is the major component to this recipe.  So make sure you choose a vinegar that you really like since the recipe doesn't specify the type of vinegar.  I left my chicken marinade longer than 8 hours.  It came out with a strong vinegar flavor.  But I was ok with that.  Also, you can put more than 4 thighs in this marinade.  It makes a good amount, I marinaded 6 thighs and could've done a few more easily.

Cornell chicken in this neck of the woods, a summertime classic. Salt potatoes and coleslaw make the best side, imho.

This was delicious. Next time I will try chicken on the bottom as potatoes were really to soft
