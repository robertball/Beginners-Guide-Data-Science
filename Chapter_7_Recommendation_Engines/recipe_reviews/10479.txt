These were great.  After dipping, I sprinkled with pecans and coconut!  Very easy.  
Tip:  Put balls in freezer to firm before dipping.  Makes it much easier

Everyone in my extended family kept snitching these delicious peanut butter balls this Christmas.  I'm a chocolate snob, so I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips.  I couldn't bear to pollute it with shortening or any other fat - and quite frankly the thicker chocolate coating was perfect for me (but had to use 3 bags of choc chips).  I microwaved the chocolate to melt it, stirring frequently, and used a spoon to dip the balls - much easier than a double boiler and toothpick routine.  And if you're wondering - use creamy peanut butter!

These were a hit at my church's Christmas party. I would recommend TWO bags of chocolate chips though. I did not have enough chocolate to cover all of the peanut butter balls.

This is such a quick recipe to make; and they dissappear just as fast! 

The only thing I did differently was I used Rice Crispies instead of the graham cracker crumbs and milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

You can also roll them in crushed nuts, cocoa powder, powdered sugar or coconut as an alternative to the chocolate.

I used this recipe last year for Christmas presents.  The recipe at that time said to combine 1 1/2 ounces of parafin with the chocolate chips, rather than the shortening.  The parafin worked great.  Haven't tried this with the shortening.

These were delicious! I used a size #60 scoop(small scoop from The Pampered Chef) to make perfect 1 Tbsp. balls. But I felt the chocolate was too thick and would melt on your hands, so I added a half a bar of parrafin wax to the MILK chocolate chips (don't care for semi-sweet). They melt in your mouth, not in your hand! Does anyone know if these freeze well???

The absolute BEST peanut butter ball recipe I've tried.  My kids and I used this recipe to make peanut butter eggs for Easter.  They turned out really well.  The texture was perfect and the taste was out of this world!  The graham cracker crumbs are the secret ingredient, I think.  My mother thought these were the best.  Candy-making can be intimidating, but this recipe is so simple and yields delicious results.  They disappear quickly, so consider doubling the recipe.  I will use this recipe every year for Christmas, and whenever else I can find an excuse to make them!

I was extremely impressed with this recipe. Reese's cups are my favorite.... OMG these taste exactly like them... very delicious! The scary part is they were way too easy to make. As several other reviewers mentioned chilling the dough after the little balls are made works perfect. Something I didn't read that made it easier for me. Second batch I chilled all the little balls and during that time is when I warmed up my chocolate chips in the microwave, that way it was timed perfect instead of the chocolate setting a bit before the balls were chilled. Very good recipe, thanks!

Great recipe but if you have a Sams Club,get there Ghiradelli chocolate. It is in a large flat box.I believe there is a pound for $5 something. Well worth it if you want delicous candy!!!!!

Have been doing this for years will share a few tricks of mine.  Some have it right put the mix in the freezer in a metal mixing bowl as it gets colder quicker for about 30 minutes. Double the recipe and the total amount of p. butter after doubling is 4 cups.  Also use 1 bag of semi-sweet chips and 1 bag of milk chocolate chips and 3/4 bar of parafin wax.  To cut your work way down and the overall key is I use a fondue pot as I got one as a gift specifically to make p. butter balls.  The fondue pot comes with forks to dip with, and what helps overall the chocolate mixture stays warm to dip with.  Hope this helps as I am sharing some major learnings acquired over the years!  Not bragging, but it will be 5 stars now after the tips...just needed tweaking.

This recipe was so incredibly easy and delicious!!! I did have to use more shortening in the chocolate to make it dippable, but other than that - perfect! I also topped with sliced almonds, coconut flakes, drizzled white chocolate, or sprinkles for a pretty presentation. A must try! - edit - after making this once, I thought this was just way too sweet. Now I only use 3 cups sugar and increased the graham crackers to almost 2 cups to keep the consistency. They are way better now, you can eat a couple and enjoy them without being overwhelmed with sweetness and the peanut butter taste comes through more.

I make these for Halloween. I make them into eyeballs. Instead of chocolate, I use white chocolate. By the time I am done dipping all of them, they're pretty much set so I can start making the veins of the eyeball with the frosting gells (you can buy in grocery stores)...everyone loves them, makes great effect for party!

Delicious! Kind of reese peanut butter cupish but without the huge factory to manufacture it!  Melts in your mouth. I used half semi sweet chocolate and half milk chocolate. Great addition to my christmas baking.

Awesome. These are so good and so cute. I took advice and froze with tooth picks in them. That made it very easy to do the dipping.

Even better than Reese's Peanut butter cups! I used milk chocolate chips (with a few semi-sweet thrown in.) After measuring the ingredients out, I started to just mix it to taste. Worked great. I Pam-ed a mini-muffin pan and pressed the PB mixture into it and then froze the pan. They popped right out and I dipped in chocolate. Way good!

The texture was spot on! I was looking for something other than rice crispies and the graham cracker crumbs were perfect! I'm giving this 4 stars because they were SOOOO SWWEEEEETTTT!! I love sweets and always joke that I was created without a "too sweet sensor" and this was one of the 1st times I thought I could barely eat one without rushing to the bathroom to brush my teeth after, lol. I will definitely make these again and at least 1/2 the amount of confectioners' sugar.  EDIT!!!*~ Ok, so I take it all back! I tried these after chilling them for about 5 hours and they were YUMMY!! Maybe right away the ingredients haven't 'settled together'?! I dunno, but even though I want to cringe at the idea of adding 4 cups of confectioners' sugar, just do it! They're yummy!! :o)

Delicious! I'm not big on measuring and I just tossed this recipe together by eye...it turned out perfect!! A big hit in my house! I plan on keeping a few bags in the freezer to pull out when we need a sugar hit. The peanut butter portion should be crumbly, you should be able to make firm little balls which I suggest sticking in the freezer to harden before coating with chocolate. If your balls seem too mushy just add some more cracker crumbs and/or sugar.

Too sweet!  My hubby didn't think so... but next time I make these I will only put in 3 cups of sugar and WAY more (2 cups) peanut butter.  It could stand to have more graham cracker crumbs, too.  I was able to make ONE bag of choc. chips last the whole time, but I added a little cream and oil for a smoother texture.  I think that those will affect the hardening capabilities of the chocolate... we'll see!   Good, but next time only 3 cups sugar!!!  It's got potential.

Perfect! I cut the recipe in half and got 30 balls. The way that most people around here make them is to resemble buckeyes...dip the lower 80% or so into the chocolate, and let harden with the peanut butter "spot" facing up. I grew up with them completely covered in the chocolate, sometimes with sprinkles, shredded coconut, or chopped peaunts on top. Either way, this was exactly the taste memory I was searching for!

Easy and yummy! I had some peanut butter balls at a party not long after I made these that used Rice Krispies instead of graham cracker crumbs-- added a nice crunch! I also like to use the Dark Chocolate Chips when I make mine.

These are soooo good! I changed a few things just to help me. I used Rice Crispies instead of graham crackers (2 cups) and I mixed the ingredients one step at a time instead of altogether. It worked better for me to do it this way. Also I put mix in fridge to let it harden before rolling them out. And then I put them back in the freezer before dipping in chocolate.
Thank you for this recipe. I will use it from this year on. Delicious!!!

I love this recipe!!! I did not change a thing. These can be frozen in ball shapes in a container weeks before you have to coat them in chocolate, so they are good to pre-make incase you are short on time or like to have something quick on hand for the last minute I freeze the balls first with toothpicks in them so that I can dip and roll them in chocolate. I use a teaspoon to pour chocolate over them to assure they are gully coated and then refrigerate. Because they peanut butter mix is so cold the chocolate hardens straight away too. Once fully set I just toss them in a container and they might last a day or two!

As far as taste these would get a 5, but they are not worth the effort. I think I will stick to peabut butter bars instead.

These are awesome!!!!  I followed the directions, as stated. I used my hand held mixer with the dough beaters to mix it.  This worked really well.  I used WAY more chocolate chips than 2 cups, but couldn't figure out how to get less on the balls.  Several neighbors tried them, and I am giving them out for Christmas treats in the neighborhood.  Compliments, compliments, compliments!! Thank you for the recipe!  I am making more today!

These are really, really good and rich.  You need to chill the dough for quite awhile before you try to roll it in balls and dip it in the chocolate.  Otherwise it is too soft for a toothpick to stay in it.  We ended up using a spoon and dipping it in the chocolate that way.  It was messy and they were ugly but we had fun and they still tasted great, so it was fine!

Very good recipe!  I get complements every time I fix them and they never last very long.  I use chocolate almond bark instead of chocolate chips.

I gave this 4 stars because I did make some changes.  First off I only used 3 cups of Confectioners sugar which in my opinion was more than enough as they were really sweet.  I also used 1 sleeve of graham crackers which was all I had on hand and added powdered milk to the mix until the peanut butter mixture was the consistency I wanted.  These were wonderful and I will definitely be making them again, though I may cut the sugar to 2 or 2-1/2 cups next time and just add more cracker crumbs and powdered milk so they aren't so sweet.  I also recommend making them smaller than 1 inch as they are very rich.

I was a little questionable about adding the graham crackers but did so anyway. I tasted the batter and it seemed a little "gritty" to me. I used my Kitchenaid mixer to make SURE they were blended well so on that thought....they are very good so far but wouldn't add the crackers again. I prefer mine a little smoother. Do recommend using the Pampered Chef small scoop for perfect sizing and have them in the fridge now to chill before dipping!

Almost perfect!!!Just a little too sweet(which I didn't think was possible)but I used 2.5 cups of sugar,and it was still pretty sweet.Otherwise,I would have rated it a 5. Loved it with less sugar and will definately make it again!

One word....... WONDERFUL!!!! Suggestion: make the one inch balls and then refridgerate for a few hours before dipping in hot chocolate, as peanut butter gets difficult to handle otherwise.

i'd been seriously craving these, and i'm glad i made them.  they are delicious, but they are rich!

great recipe, but i felt that the chocolate to fat ratio in the sauce wasn't right.  i had to add a lot of extra fat to make it smooth and thin enough for dipping.

i found they were easy to dip with chopsticks.  the toothpick didn't pull the peanut butter ball out of the chocolate again.

i made a couple of changes-- i melted the butter for the dough as recommended by other users.  they bound together well, so i'm glad i did.  also, as i live in the uk and don't have any access to graham crackers, i used crushed up digestives.  if you've never had them, don't be shocked by the name.  they're actually pretty similar to graham crackers and they are often used, crushed up, for an easy pie crust.  i needed 8 plain digestives for this recipe.

also, for those that don't know: the easiest way to crush graham crackers [or digestives for that matter] is in a ziplock  bag [remove excess air] and a rolling pin.  it's so much easier!

thanks for this recipe.

I tend to be very critical of my junk food - especially where chocolate and peanut butter are involved - and I thought this recipe was amazing (dare I say better than reese's cups?). If you don't have graham crackers handy, you can substitute in golden grahams cereal (just omit a little powdered sugar to make up for the added sweetness of the cereal). I've also used corn flakes in a pinch. I will say that I usually use a little less powdered sugar than the recipe calls for because the peanut butter filling is a bit sweet, but the semisweet chips balance it out well.

Great Recipie! Simple to make.  Easy to decorate.  Yummy too!!  

As for the recipie itself you need more chocolate to coat than it calls for.  Thankfully I had extra chocolate on hand to melt otherwise I wouldn't have had enough coat the balls.  Using a toothpick to dip them and freezing them to firm up is The best thing for dipping them easily.   I also liked the milk chocolate better with the peaunt butter.  I wanted a little less sugar in these because I wasn't fond of it with all four cups so I added a 1/4 cup of Peanut Butter and 1/2 cup of crushed graham crackers.  Still had an amazing texture.  

Also if you want to drizzle with peanut butter take chips and melt with shortening or Peanut butter to give a loose consitancy to drizzle over the balls.  These are my new go to for gifts and any event.

These were amazing!!  Instead of cutting the chocolate with shortening we used only chocolate chips and they were such a huge hit!  I made them for my Fiance's Thesis proposal and all the scientists, professors and grad students that attended raved about them afterwords!!  They taste just like a giant Reese's PB cup!!

I made them just as the recipe directed and they were absolutely decadent. I found an excellent twist. I used brown sugar (1 cup) and three packets of Truvia, then doubled the graham crackers. I then used 1/8 teaspoon of salt to bring out the peanut taste.  I recommend putting the graham crackers into a food processor to create a smooth texture. This way it is less sugar.   Ghiradelli is perfect. I tried the 60% Cacao and it made the perfect cover. Also, I only dipped the balls half way to save on chocolate.   Thanks for the awesome starter recipe, Sharon!

I LOVE these, but I think I'd love them better if someone else made them. It's a lot of work, and you need way more chocolate than listed because it coats the balls too thick. At least that was my experience. And I couldn't find a very good way to thin it down without ruining the chocolate. Very yummy though, and always a hit!

These are excellent! I used white bark coating instead of chocolate chips and shortening. Freezing the mixture for a little bit before balling helps quite a bit. I balled them, put them into little cups, and spooned the white coating over them. They almost look like white chocolate Reese's! Super easy and delicious. Perfect for family gatherings and holidays!

Almost perfect!  These are close to my mom's, who makes them without a recipe.  I used a bag and a half of chocolate chips to dip them and cooled them in the freezer to make them slightly firm so dipping was much easier.  I added paraffin wax to the chocolate, but didn't add enough because they were still sticky to the touch.  That's the only flaw with this recipe.  The chocolate needs wax to set it.  (Paraffin is not generally edible, but my family has been making candy with it for years.)  I might try the Dolci Frutta chocolate dip next time for a good coating without the wax and a lighter chocolate flavor.

super addicting! I used butter instead of shortening and yes, definitely refrigerate or freeze before dipping in chocolate. The only thing I may switch is the semi-sweet chocolate- next time i'm going to use milk chocolate; it's a better complement to the peanut butter. These are definitely always a hit though...I'm always told they taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!

This recipe is so simple and so fantastic. I took the helpful hints from the other reviews, and softened the butter and it made it much easier to mix. Also you need to freeze the peanut butter balls before attempting to dip them in the hot chocolate, it's much easier that way. I also used milk chocolate chips, just a personal preference. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to make them though because I didn't have a double boiler. But what I actually did was just melt the chips in the microwave and it worked great. The chocolate started to cool before I finished so I just put the chocolate back in the microwave for another minute and it worked out great! This recipe is by far the best I've found for peanut butter balls! I've had to make 3 batches this Christmas because they go so fast.

I made these as a gift for valentine's day to bring to school (i am in high school) they were very well recived and i even got requests for the recipe, which is pretty odd considering my friends are not avid bakers. I did think they were a bit sweet and had problems with them not sticking together enough, but i heated the mixture up some so the butter would melt and it became easier to work with. I also highly reccomend freezed the balls before you dip them. I also used spoons to help evenly distribute the chocolate.

For such a simile recipe with simple ingredients, i was impressed with the results. However, the taste was alittle on the plain side. I didn't have graham crackers on hand, so i crushed some nilla wafers to substitute. In addition, i added some cinnamon to get the graham cracker taste. I was also too lazy to melt chocolate and dip each ball, so i rolled them in a variety of toppings: shredded coconut, nilla crumbs, cinnamon sugar. The balls were more candy like after 20 minutes of refridgeration.

SO rich and SO delicious! Plus, it's so easy to make a little swirl of melted chocolate on the top to make them look professionally dipped!

I've made this recipe over and over during the holidays and I love it! It's great with or without the chocolate topping and you can either make a few really large balls or several small ones! Everyone loves them! Thank you Sharon for a great recipe!!!

They turned out really nice but I would recommend getting an extra bag or two of chocolate chips just in case, I needed 3 1/2 bags in total to cover all of them.  Everyone loved them!!

Easy and great tasting recipe. Adding my own little twist ~ I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of coconut and used semi-sweet milk chocolate. Absolutely wonderful!!!

This recipe is entirely WRONG! I have made these several times and had a recipe in my box that I couldn't locate.  So I found these on allrecipes, made them exactly as the recipe reads, and they are extremely soft and greasy.  WAY TOO MUCH butter, not enough graham cracker crumbs, and too much sugar.  If you want to throw time and money in the garbage, make this recipe.  I called my friend and after she read the recipe to me that I had previously used and provided to her, it showed me how off this recipe is.  The other recipe, which produced delicious balls, calls for 2 c. graham crackers, 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 c. chunky peanut butter, 1/4 c. Butter (note 1/4th of what this recipe calls for!!!!!!), and 1.5 # chocolate.  I'm SO irritated.  I wasted considerable money and time on this failed recipe.  I'll give the submitter the benefit of the doubt that allrecipes printed it wrong?!?!?!

Really easy to make. I melt the peanut butter and butter in the microwave and mix them together first then add the graham and icing sugar. Has a nice texture and was a big hit with the family.

Soo much better than the peanut butter balls with rice crispy's or parafin.  Will make again next xmas.  After many attempts at making candy coated balls I finally broke down and got a Wiltons dipping spoon.  So much easier.

Peanut butter and chocolate - as always, love them!  I found this recipe very easy to work with.  I had no problems rolling or dipping the balls, and they turned out very pretty, decorated for spring (I hope it's coming soon).

These are EXCELLENT!  And sooo easy too.  Changed mine up a little though.  Thought it would be nicer to have the graham cracker crumbs on the outside of the ball instead of blended into the peanut butter, so I threw the peanut butter mixture into the freezer for an hour to prevent a gooey mess, then rolled the balls in a dish of graham cracker/melted butter mixture.  Dipped these bad boys in chocolate, let them dry for a couple hours on a rack then threw in the fridge to finish hardening.  Then I sifted some cocoas over the top for a pretty truffle like finish.  By the way, these needed 2 bags of choc chips, not 1 like the recipe calls for.  Oh, and I added veg oil to the choc, not shortening because it's what I had on hand.  Overall, these came out great, about to make a second batch for Christmas gifts for the neighbors!

These were incredibly tasty and easy to make, which is right up my alley.  One change that worked out well for us:  used a little more than 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 3 cups.  The first batch I made we used the chocolate bark since it was for Christmas.  The second batch I made using Hershey's milk chocolate chips.  The first batch didn't have to be refrigerated to keep the chocolate from melting, however, the second batch using the milk chocolate chips had to be kept in the refrigerator to keep them from being messy "chocolate fingers."  My husband doesn't care for "rich" or overly sweet things, and while he can't eat more than 1 or 2 at at time, he said they were delish!

These do disappear FAST!  I would suggest adding a little more graham crackers, and a bit less powdered sugar.  For me, it was too sweet and not as peanut buttery as I'd prefer.  Milk chocolate chips were a great suggestion.  Definitely freeze before dipping, especially if you don't use a double broiler to melt the chocolate.  The microwave works, but doesn't melt down as well as over the stove.  YUM!

These are awesome!  After I mixed everything up, I put the bowl in the fridge for 15-20 so it was easier to roll them.  Then I put the balls in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, so they were easier to dip in the chocolate.  I didn't use a toothpick, I rolled the ball with a spoon.

Well having these around is torture!! I can't leave them alone.. they are just staring at me saying "come on... just one more"  Very good!, Sweet! but good! I think next time, like others have posted, I will try the milk chocolate chips.. I think it would taste alot better.. but they are certainly good as is!! I'm sending them to my uncle for his b-day!   I also dipped them using a toothpick after freezing them and found it was quite easy that way! then decorated with a few sprinkles..or as we call them, Jimmies!   and I only had the cinnamon graham crackers so that's what i used! yum!

These were so easy to make and very very, I mean very rich! One is more than enough. The kids loved them, and enjoyed making them with me! They are so easy, and fast to make. The five stars is especially for how simple and practical they are to make. Made with ingredients I always have on hands! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I wish I would have read the reviewer's suggestions BEFORE I turned this awesome recipe into a disaster. I made a HUGE mess trying to roll gooey peanut butter batter into melted chocolate. Next time I will REFRIDERATE before coating them. 
In spite of that, the texture & flavor were remarkable!
Also, I used chocolate almond bark instead of choco chips....I think it would have been just fine if I could've actually made balls instead of a mess! :)

This was my first time making these, and they turned out awesome!  However, I recommend forming them into balls BEFORE putting them in the fridge. My family begged for more!  Also, I did need more chocolate chips then the recipe called for.  The graham cracker crumbs really make these pop!

I don't think I'm making this right...I put the peanut butter balls in the fridge for 30 minutes, but they're still sliding off the toothpicks. I'm not loving the semi-sweet chocolate either- I think milk chocolate would be better. I do like the taste of the peanut butter though.

These don't have a very strong peanut butter taste (that is why I gave it a 4 out of 5), but they are still very good!  They were easy/quick to make and turned out very nice.  I rolled mine in cocoa powder instead of dipping them in melted chocolate- it worked great this way!  I will definately make these again.

So easy, affordable, and delicious! My boyfriend likes them better than Reese's cups. Tips:
-Make sure you're using softened butter (not strait from the fridge or melted)
-You can use an electric mixer.
-For dipping in the chocolate, you can use disposable wooden skewers
-If you're trying to make your own double boiler with 2 pots, be very careful not to let any water get in with the chocolate. Even the smallest amount causes the chocolate to react and go hard.
-drizzle white chocolate, or melted butterscotch chips over them for an added touch
-Definitely make these for the holidays!!

I have never made peanut butter balls before and decided to try this recipe after reading the reviews as I was goin to be having a dinner party the next day.  It was easy to make.  I follewed the recommendation of melting the butter which made things way easier and I used milk choc chocolate chips and used the two bags as recommended.  I was a little worried at first about the sweetness as the dough was very sweet but in the end they were just perfect.  I also put them in the fridge to harden before the chocolate part.  When they were hard I found it very easy to put the toothpicks in them and dip them.  EXCELLENT RECIPE everybody including my one year old and my very, very picky 4 year old loved them....too bad I am on a diet and cant completely enjoy them.

I love this recipe - to me these make the best peanut butter balls. I use milk chocolate chips to roll them in. I shape mine in a log, roll it in chips and once refrigerated and sliceable - I slice it like bread and it makes like a little patty.

It would be hard for me to give a peanut butter ball anything but a 5 star!! I love them, and I especially enjoyed these. The crushed graham crackers was such a nice addition. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

My husband is a peanut butter ball NUT! He has a family recipe that he has made for ages. I suggested that he try this recipe because I thought the graham crackers were an interesting addition. This is sure to be a new family classic. The perfect combination of sugar to chocolate. The graham cracker adds a wonderful depth to the peanut butter. This recipe truly takes this from basic holiday fair to good enough to give as holiday gifts! A definite keeper!!!

These are the best BP balls I have ever made.  The graham cracker crumbs really make this recipe.  You will need a lot more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for.

These peanut butter balls tasted good but I found them to be a pain to make.  I had a hard time coating them with the chocolate.  I doubt I'll make them again just for the reason that it was very time consuming.  It was worth the try though.  Thanks

This is a 5 for taste! ( I even liked it better the next day!)BUT..lol this was not easy to do with a tooth-pick! I used a demi spoon and a tooth-pick & it worked much better! Also I've found that you can do half then put the rest of the mix in a baggie & toss in the fridg to do at a later date! AND I also needed more hips than called for! :) Yummy the Fam LOVED them!

This recipe was WAY too sweet, I omitted one cup of icing sugar and added 1/2 cup peanut butter, a little more butter and graham crackers.  Also, the measurement for the melted chocolate is too low as there was not even close to enough to cover all of the dough.

After messing around with this recipe there was just too much sugar and the balls were dry. Instead of wasting all the batter I had, I added another cube of melted butter, about 3/4 cup of peanut butter and the same of graham crackers.  THAT did it.  It was now the consistency of reese's peanut butter cups.  Now I have to figure out how to not eat them all before giving them out for Christmas gifts :D

This was very simple to make turned out great.  I used milk chocolate chips.  The peanut butter mixture was very crumbly so I had to be careful when forming the balls.  I used a small scoop and pressed it all together.

I have made this on a number of occasions.
This is my son's favourite. We used to make them together but now he is 26 and hard to motivate but he still loves eating them lol.
I started making small ones and I got lazy and then thought. I will make bigger ones! He will love it! We never dipped them totally in chocolate but just put a dollop on top.
He was pretty blown away.
I have attached a picture of the progression.

I  can't tell you how many times I have made these peanut butter balls. I would make a double batch and I'd take them to work during the holidays. By lunch the only thing left would be the container. They are easy to make and people love the.

I substituted half of the graham crumbs for Rice Krispies as I like the little crunch.  I used smooth peanut butter this time but have also made them with crunchy, they are both good and give you a different texture.  I did find them a bit too sweet, so this time used unsweetened  peanut butter and also used slightly less sugar.  I found this worked better as it kept the consistency the same.  Instead of using chocolate chips I  used chocolate melting wafers to dip in, which works much better.

Absolutely delicious!  I made them according to the recipe and the gals at the party last night raved about them, and now they're texting for the recipe!  I put the graham crackers in the blender to get a powdery consistency which made the inside sooo creamy!

My only slightly negative comment is that this is a huge recipe.  Next time I make it, I will halve it.  I dipped half of the balls in chocolate almond bark and the other half in vanilla  almond bark,  and used a different type of Christmas sprinkles on each color.  They were pretty and very popular at the two Christmas parties I brought them to.  They are definitely going to be a new tradition!

Fantastic and easy!! I always get tons of compliments... instead of shortening and semisweet morsels I use 2 full bars sweet German bakers chocolate and a block of paraffin wax melted in a double boiler.

We used 2 bags of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips.  We used a mellon baller to portion out the 120 dough balls.  We also put them in the freezer before dipping them.  We found small tongs were better for dipping them in the melted chocolate rather than tooth picks.  They kept coming off the tooth picks and then were difficult to get back on.   When they were all dipped, we put them on waxed paper in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate and decided to leave them there.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for my mom's christmas party and I came across this.  I made just as the recipe said but didn't have semi-chocolate chips and had to use milk chocolate instead.  I didn't think it would be such a hit but everyone loved these.  People were grabbing whatever was left as I was walking out the door with them and ended up going home with only three left.  A tip from another reviewer about putting them in the freezer for a little bit to make them more stiff so they would stick on a toothpick for dipping was very helpful.  I also don't have a double boiler so I just heated the chocolate mixture over low heat.

once he beanut butter balls are made they are pretty gooy , not sure how you are suppose to then dip them into the chocolate without making a mess and loosing there form...i think maybe chilling them for a while might be in order before dipping into chocloate to keep there form and so that the chocolate cools faster.

Loved the recipe.  But since my husband is allergic to peanut butter and wheat, I used soy nut butter instead of peanut butter and used gluten free graham crumbs.  Also did the paraffin wax instead of shortening?

Oh my goodness these are delicious. And they are responsible for me dieting now...because I had a little trouble controlling myself. LOL.
I did as another suggested and added some crushed rice crispies.  I just 'eye-balled it' on quantity but it was about a cup.   I served these at my Christmas party and everyone loved them.  NOTE:  they are best cold.

I have made this recipe several times.  My significant other loves these and for some reason by the time I am ready to make my gift trays around Christmas, half of what I made has disappeared.  I checked his breath....Hmmmm.  Anyway, I use candy melts for my chocolate.  I use Merken's brand that can be found at various candy making websites. I dip mine in either milk or dark chocolate.  Then when that chocolate has set up, I melt a few red and green pieces.  I put one color in a small zippable sandwich bag and melt them in the microwave.  One minute, smoosh the melts together and then microwave for 15 second intervals, smooshing after eat until the chocolate is melted and smooth. I then cut a "teeny" hole out of one corner and then put stripes on the balls.  I have also, when the balls were still damp and shiny have added cake decorations such as colored crystal sugar and other cake decorations.  Easy and good.

Omg, so good! They really do need to be left overnighting blend flavour. I would Mix in 1/2 cup less icing sugar next time because u use quite a bit to get them rolled.
I added some butter to the choc to get a creamy texture, but not too much as it gets too thin and you need it thick for a nice coating. 
Make sure to freeze PB balls before dipping.

This is a good basic recipe. I like my peanut butter balls to taste like Reese's peanut butter cups. I skipped the graham crumbs,  reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and added about a teaspoon of salt. It tastes a lot like Reeses then.

Everyone loved these!  I used a little less sugar though because I don't like too much sweet.

Love these!  Substituted crispy rice cereal for the graham crackers for a little different crisp, and also, crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.  I had to hide them from the kids just to make sure my hubby had some to take to work!  :)

I give the peanut butter mixture of this recipe a million and one stars because it's fantastic. The only snag I ran into was the chocolate. First problem - not enough. 2 cups only covers about 1/2, so double that for sure. Second problem - dunking. I took the advice of another reviewer and popped them in the freezer. This is definitely necessary and the toothpick in the center helps too. My problem was that I took them out of the freezer while I was melting my chocolate, so they warmed up again. Oops. Best to put the toothpick in, put them in the freezer to get almost hard, then dunk immediately. I plan to make these again and again, and hopefully find a way to perfect the dunking technique to reduce the inevitable mess. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very yummy! Tastes like Reeses PB cups. (I used the chocolate candy coating blocks instead of chips.)

So good!  I recommend 3 cups of chocolate chips and 1.5 tablespoons butter for the chocolate coating.  All my friends and family love these things!

Very, very rich and sweet. I could only eat 2. Definitely freeze your pb mixture with a toothpick in there or it will be quite difficult to handle. I used 2 c milk chocolate, 1 1/2 tbsp shortening, and 1/2 cup butter melted in my mini crock. It got too hot so I had to turn it off.

Great recipe. Lots of other people mentioned that they stuck the balls in the fridge or freezer before dipping because they were sticky - mine were actually a bit crumbly and dry. They were still easy to form into balls, but I had no problem dipping them right away. :) I used a spoon to dip them into the chocolate.

I also found that the choc chips needed more shortening so the chocolate was thin enough to coat the balls in. I think I used about 4 tbsp. of shortening.

Simply delicious! I did read some of the reviews and used half milk choc. and the wax instead of the shortning and they were wonderful! However, I didnt make them for myself, only for my husband, haha, he loved them though! Thanks so much! This was my first time making them, and it will def. be the recipe I use from now on! Thanks SO much!

This is a great recipe and very easy to make.  I also like to roll out the dough and cut it out with small cookie cutters then dip it in the chocolate.  This makes a great gift!

Yummy!  I made these exactly as directed, but found as others did that the chocolate to fat ratio was low, I added another couple tablespoons of butter to the chocolate to get it smooth.  Really good recipe, thanks for sharing.

I was so happy to find this recipe which is similar to one that I have been making for years.  Unfortunately, I dropped my recipe onto a stove burner and it singed it so badly that I couldn't make out the quantities. I do have a suggestion.  I melt the butter and it blends better with the dry ingredients. With my old recipe you used about a half square of wax melted. Also, I always add one can of Baker's Coconut to the mixture. I will try this using the shortening and see how I like the coating that way.
