These muffins can easily become healthier.  I  reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and made one cup of the flour to be whole wheat.  It still tasted great!  The next time I make these I'll reduce the butter - it's on the greasy side.  But I will make them again!  Yum.  Happy huckleberry picking!

Huckleberries grow wild right in my backyard so I can pick to my heart's content.  This recipe really makes the berries pop.  My boys want huckleberry muffins now every breakfast.  I also used this same recipe to make cherry muffins with the cherries from our tree.  They were great also.  Blackberries are next!

These were really yummy. They were really light and fluffy which was good but made it hard for them to come out of the paper while they were still warm. Once they cooled off, the paper came off easier.

I made this recipe for a work potluck using raspberries instead of huckleberries. The were tender and lovely with a burst of tart raspberry. I followed the recipe (except for the fruit) and I'll make this again.

I got rave reviews for these muffins from all who tried them.    I was using up my frozen huckleberries so my bake time was a little longer, but other than that, I made no changes to the recipe.

This recipe is amazing! My husband couldn't get enough and has insisted we go out to pick more berries to freeze so I can make double batches through out the year. Followed the recipe exactly as stated and everything was perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I'm not a baker, but this recipe was foolproof enough to turn out excellent muffins in spite of my limited skills.  I used fresh-picked huckleberries from the Indian Heaven Wilderness of SW Washington.  Their flavor is more intense and fuller than a blueberry - the muffins were fantastic!

This recipe is amazing! I made this for my coworkers after picking huckleberries last weekend & one gal said they were "the best muffins I have ever had". This is a recipe I will make for years to come.

These are delicious!  We didn't have huckleberries, but blueberries tasted great.  I also tried with chocolate chips instead of berries and my kids absolutely LOVED them.

I made this recipe with fresh blueberries. At first I was concerned because the batter is REALLY thick, thicker than I have ever seen muffin batter. It literally stuck to the spoon when turned sideways. I did a few with the thick batter and then added a splash of milk to the rest to see if I could tell the difference and I couldn't. I just have to say, THESE ARE THE BEST MUFFINS EVER! I will never use another recipe. I made 24 muffins and they were gone in 2 days. My fiance was eating them 3 at a time. YUM!

The batter is so-o-o-o sweet! I live in Denver (high altitude) so I added at least 2 extra Tablespoons of flour...it wasn't enough. 

In addition to the extra flour, I think I would use a little less milk and a little less baking powder.

Great recipe! I replace with whole wheat flour (the texture is so much better this way!), and I cook for 18 minutes instead of the suggested 15.

I thought it was a good recipe, but it is hard to make in larger muffin cups because it seems the center takes longer to get done.  However, once you get the center done all the way, they are great.

Great muffins. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of butter. Thanks.

I was cooking at my partners house and didnâ€™t realize they didnâ€™t have a muffin tin! So I poured it in an 8x8 and cooked it in a convection oven at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes. It was really good, but next time I will probably only put in 3/4th a cup of sugar or even a 1/2 cup because it was a bit too sweet for me.

I used a half cup of sour cream and a half cup of water instead of milk. Added extra hucks, brkwn sigar spronkled on the top. Blammo! Best moist and yummy muffins! They don't rise too much so don't be afraid to fill them to the top.

I found this recipe too sweet and greasy for my taste.  Even with tart berries.  I used wild coastal huckleberries and wild blackberries.  I don't think I will make this recipe again.  My search for the perfect muffin batter continues.

The recipe is good as it stands.   If using huckleberries the sugar called for in the recipe is just right.

This made 6 large muffins, baked for 23 min.

This recipe is going in my cookbook. I did make a few small changes. I replaced 1/4 cup of the butter with plain sour cream,  I replaced 3/4 cup of the flour with wheat flour, and I added another 1/4 cup of frozen huckleberries. These were probably some of the best muffins I have ever made. Soo so yummy.

I made it as a cake, not muffins, with fresh passion fruit and orange, grated peel and a little juice. It  came out really well, rose nicely, crispy on our side soft inside very nice. Made it for Valentines Day!

These muffins turned out perfect.  With the added tablespoon of flour mixed with the huckleberries, the moisture was retained without being too runny.  I would definitely make them again.

These are fantastic.....I did substitute huckleberries with blueberries and raspberries combo and doubled the amount of fruit. You can cut amount of sugar in half and replace half of flour with ivory wheat flour (organic). They were still light in taste, a bit healthier version, sooooooo juicy and definite favourite in my house !!!

Fantastic!  I didn't have huckleberries but instead used black raspberries.  I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups and they were still very sweet.  Added more vanilla.  Also I made 12 muffins instead of 15 since my pan only holds 12.  Deeeeeelicious.  Will be making these again and might reduce the sugar even more.

This recipe was lovely! I actually used blackberries instead of huckleberries and it still turned out great. I also had no eggs, so I put in 1 tsp baking powder, 1 1/2 TBS water, and 1 1/2 TBS oil per egg. I'm going to try it again with eggs, but I'm sure they won't disappoint!

I am blessed to be in Huckleberry country this summer & my husband, dog, & I went hiking on the Mtn & found big patches of them. Found this recipe & tried it. I couldn't find my muffin pan so I put in a 9x12 pan & doubled the Huckleberries, made a 1/2 C flour, 1/4 C sugar, & 2 tbs of butter streusel topping & baked for 10 min longer (testing with toothpick).  Well, we loved it so much that we are going to hike (pick) the Mtn again! This is a keeper. I know raspberries (since Hucklberries are way more flavorful than blueberries) will be as good in this. Thnx for the great recipe!

Good base recipe, but WAY too sweet. Huckleberries have more complex flavor when they're not dulled by sugar. I'd cut the sugar in half and probably add a tsp. of lemon zest to this. But the muffin base is great!

So moist and delicious! Only thing I did different was use margarine instead of butter, because it was what I had. I made them once using raspberries (did not have huckleberries), second time with raspberries and dark chocolate chips (reduced sugar to 1/2 cup), and a third time with raspberries and white chocolate chips (reduced sugar to 1/2 cup). Awesome every time! It is now my base muffin recipe...will try blueberries in them next time.

I was looking for a generic muffin recipe to add dried cranberries to this morning, since that is what I had on hand.  None of the cranberry muffin recipes had very good reviews, so I thought I'd try this one.  They were delicious!  The only thing I changed about this recipe was I used dried cranberries instead of huckleberries.  (it's January in the midwest, so no huckleberries are to be found)  Since I used dried cranberries instead of fresh berries, I did not coat them in flour.  I had to add about 2-3 minutes to the baking time for them to be done, but I think my oven isn't 100% accurate.  (or so my husband says).  My 3 year old ate 2 after having a bowl of cereal!  They didn't even need butter or anything on them, they were so moist!  I've saved this to my recipe box to use again!

I had some of these in my yard and I  didn't know what to do with them. These came out really good. Frooze well too.

Because I did not have a muffin pan, I made it as a cake . It did take longer to cook, but was super good and moist.
