Uncooked potatoes can take a long time to cook, esspecially compared to the green peppers and onions. THEREFORE, I cubed and cooked the potatoes first (in some veg oil instead of butter), added the green peppers, onions (as well as some fresh mushrooms, cooked/cubed ham and chopped broccoli) once the potatoes were almost done.  Then, I added apprx 1/4c milk to the beaten eggs and poured overall, flipping to cook.  Sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese overall. Predictable taste but good none-the-less. Thanks Maggie.

This recipe is great and couldn't be simpler.  My brother introduced me to it, although he calls it a breakfast skillet since he makes everything in one pan.  We will also add bacon, sausage or ham depending on what is in the fridge.  Basically you can throw just about anything you want in.  We have also added cheese, tomatoes, green onions, and mushrooms.  It is really open to anything you want.

This recipe was a real hit.. I nuked the potato in the microwave first for about 2 mins and then sliced and browned it. This really cut down on the prep time.

I loved this!! I have made scrambled eggs numerous times with green bell peppers, but with the mix of onion and the potatoes, this is great. I had used left over potatoes that I had par-boiled then grilled, so I just cut them up and browned them in the pan. I used red onion and a mix of red and green bell peppers. I actually made this for myself for dinner and it was very filling. Crushed red pepper flakes is tasty on this too, adds a little zip. I will definitely make this again. Thanks (:

This is a good basic recipe, if you're looking for a different twist on scrambled; I have often used leftover home fries.  Warm them up to get them crispier in the skillet -- add the pepper/onion.  Never, never add salt & pepper while cooking!  Save it for the table, so people can adjust to their own personal taste.  My husband has always liked to add a splash of Tobassco sauce to his...

I loved the change of having vegetables with my scrambled eggs.  I added a little milk which made the eggs fluffy.  Will have many times over.

Very tasty! Followed others' suggestions: used frozen potatoes (southern hashed), browned potatoes til crispy, added milk to the eggs, added browned sausage. Next time will try cubed ham or canadian bacon. Made for Father's Day breakfast and my husband and children loved it!

Really good! I found that salt and pepper had to be added, and I did a 2/3 ratio for potatoes to eggs. My family loved it.

My wife and I eat a similar dish at least once a week, sometime for breakfast and also dinner. I use bacon, cooked first. Remove bacon from frying pan leave the grease, add potatoes and mixed peppers frying until lightly browned. Add the bacon back in, I use 2 eggs per person, well beaten. For fluffier eggs add a dollop of sour cream to the eggs and beat well. Making sure the frying pan is not to hot, add the eggs and fold them into the mixture in the frying pan, continue folding eggs until cooked but don't over cook them they should be moist. Serve hot.

I've made these for years. Start out browning frozen hash brown cubes.  When they're almost done throw in the onion and green pepper.  When they're almost done start scrambling your eggs with milk in another pan.  When the eggs are done add them together, add a little garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. They're great. My kids wrap them in tortillas, the hubby adds salsa to them, and I eat them as they sit. They're great.

Delicious! For 2 servings worth, I used 1 medium potato and 4 egg whites. I microwaved a peeled potato for 4 minutes, cut it into cubes and browned it with onion. I added cumin and green peas while sauteeing and it went really well with the potato/onion mix. 
Great recipe and super filling! I'll be making again!

This is a typical German eggs recipe, aka, Hoppel Poppel.  Can't say as I've ever seen it referred to as Irish eggs.

my son and father inlaw and I mad a version of this with bacon mixed in when we were camping on a riverbank in Colorado. we had everyone on the river hungry just from the smell. It's real handy when you only have 1 skillet.

This was super easy to make and oh so delicious to eat. I added some salt & pepper and made it under the grill (broiler) on the high setting! Made it as part of mis7up's forgotten treasures blog and am glad!This is a keeper and regular dish on our menu!

This was a good heavy breakfast that I made when we were up in the Boundary Waters for a weekend of fishing. I added some extra red and green peppers and about 1/2 an onion, chopped. I did cook the potatoes for a little bit before adding the other ingredients. I didn't want the potatoes to be crunchy/uncooked. Topped with a bit of cheese and some pepper, and it was delish!

I have been making something similar, but I start with a lb of breakfast sausage.  Cook and drain and set aside cook the potatoes. Once the potatoes (or hash browns) are cooked, combine eggs, cheese, sausage, and peach mango salsa and cook until the eggs are done.  The salsa makes it awesome.

Mmmmm, I love a good breakfast cassarole.  I added 2 T. Of basil to give it more flavor, added another 1/2 onion, and added 2 more eggs.  Be sure to add a about 1T. Of milk per egg while beating.  Salt and pepper, of course, are also needed.  The chunks of potato were too big for me, so I will be sure to chop them into smaller pieces next time.

This was a fantastic easy one pan dish!  Would make a really yummy breakfast but I made it for dinner and was great!  I didn't have any onions in the fridge so i used 2 cloves of garlic, and I was out of green pepper too so I used a poblano pepper... super delish!

This is really good! This is my new Sunday breakfast recipe (actually, I made this as a last minute dinner). I cooked up 1 cup sausage first, skipped the butter and proceeded with the recipe. I will make this often and adapt it with what I have on hand and different spices. Thank you!

We called this "scrabble" and was a simple, cheap meal.  You do need to cook the potatoes before anything else if they are raw.  My mother used to use left over boiled potatoes (red or white) cut up.  All she really needed to do was to brown them with the onion and whatever else she threw in.  I find that if you dice the raw potatoes into 1/2" pieces, they cook through relatively fast and brown nicely in a non-stick skillet.  I also add about a tablespoon of water and cover to steam them, if needed, after browning.  This is one of my favorite comfort foods.  Season with salt and pepper, maybe some garlic and sometimes I'll toss in a little Worcestershire sauce.  This is one of those recipes that you can experiment with and truly make it your own.

This is pretty good, even though I didn't have onions or peppers.  I did add bacon, but I also added salt, pepper, parsley, and onion powder.  I had already cooked potatoes that I sliced and browned, then added the eggs to the pan.  I don't think I'd try this with uncooked potatoes--would take too long.  We both liked them and it was a nice breakfast for the two of us.  Thanks.

Loved this recipe, i used 12 egg whites instead of eggs to lower the fat content and it was a great meal.

Growing up poor, we had a very similar recipe. We would go out to the garden, grab some veggies, go to the chicken house, grab some eggs, and throw them together. At the time, bratwurst was inexpensive, so my mother would fry some of that up with the veggies. Then she'd crack the eggs in, mix it up, and then let it cook. Mom called it "scuttlebutt" to amuse us kids. :)

This was a weekend staple for our family in the 60s and 70s.  We always called it slum gullion.  You started with leftover potatoes, and since we were a meat and potatoes household, my mom would cook plenty of potates knowing that any left would go into weekend slum.  Usually some leftover ham went is, almost always, and we used plenty of onions.

My older brother Scott, when he was just making some for himself, might dice and throw in some tomatoes for tomato slum.

Raw potatoes would have been too much work.  The object was feed our huge family quickly and move on!

This recipe was useless.  I read about a dozen reviews and they all said the same thing the raw potatoes don't work!  Not sure why they gave so many stars when they all changed the recipe!  6 potatoes is WAY TOO many if they aren't tiny, also won't cook well that way.  Also the eggs were burnt on the bottom by the time the top was cooked.

I've been making this for years but never knew it was called Irish Eggs. I cube my potatoes small so they don't take so long to cook. Sliced tomatoes when they're in season and maybe toast and you are all set. Great for Sunday breakfast and super easy.

I also nuke the potatoes first, meanwhile sauteeing onion and broccoli or other green veggie. Then I add the egg, milk and cheese, sometimes ham, also 1/3 tsp of ground chili pepper for flavor. If you do the prep the night before it's a quick, easy and nutritious breakfast for teens who may not eat again till they get home!

Very good breakfast idea. I used frozen hash brown potatoes and added fresh minced garlic. I like to add garlic to most things. I also added milk and cheese to my eggs.

Doesnt really matter who or what country came up with the idea its good and really  easy and you can put in whatever tickles your fancy. I havent used frozen potatoes before but usually make this using leftover potatoes I have on hand.  They can be mashed cubed....Spices are an individual choice. One doesn't make it better or worse. Just different. Be creative throw in cheese, veggies,meat.... Fresh tomatoes are our fav.

This is such a great recipe in that it is so versatile. Irish, German, Italian, French ? ... My Hungarian grandmother used to make this. I'm sure every nation has broken some eggs, and had their own name for it... I just call it delicious. My gram even used to use leftover noodles instead of potatoes sometimes .... yummy !!

We made this all the time in Girl Scouts. We called it Pioneer Breakfast. A one pot meal that cleaned up well and everyone enjoyed it. Cook the bacon. Add chopped onions and cook till soft. Take out bacon and onion. Cook the potatoes till soft. Add bacon and onions. Add eggs and scramble till eggs are cooked to desired doneness. 

YUM.

This was OK.  It definitely needed seasonings!  There also weren't enough eggs for the potatoes; I wish I'd reduced the potatoes by half. If you cook the potatoes with the other vegetables, they'll have to be pretty thin to get done at the same time. I diced my potatoes and started them in the microwave for a couple minutes before frying them in the skillet.  I added the other vegetables when they were almost done.

Excellent! I used canned sliced potatoes and chopped pork sausage.  Fried the uncooked sausages then added the potatoes to brown with the sausage, onion and peppers.  A little rustic toast and Kerry butter with fresh brewed Irish tea made for a great Paddy's Day breakfast.

Sliced AND Chopped the potatoes, and browned them first, as they would have taken longer to cook than the onion and pepper. Added bacon. Was delicious.

Being a Catholic who used to have meatless Fridays, as well as during the Lenten Season, my Italian Grandmom and Mom always had this as part of a menu selection rotated along with other meatless meal. Sometimes it was lunch, as my brother and I walked home from school, for the noon meal.  Sometimes even a light supper when we were fasting as a Lenten sacrifice...  After I married, I served it to my family of 6 children.  Always, though, it was enjoyed by all... Guess I always thought of it as Italian fare...  Must be an International treat!  Now as an empty nester, I just might make some tomorrow, thanks for the reminder...

Fantastic recipe.....my only confusion is if they are Irish Eggs why did no one add green food coloring? The day can then start out with "the wearin' of the green" and put everyone in the mood for a fun day!

My mom used to make this not for breakfast, but as a special treat for dinner when I was a kid.  She just called it fried potatoes with eggs.  Mom always made this with sausage, but it's good with bacon or even no meat added.  thanks for sharing!

I didn't care for this at all. For a novice cook: add the onions after the potatoes have started cooking; also salt and pepper. The directions mention "scramble", but the photo shows an omelet and there are way too many potatoes for the amount of eggs. It seemed like a poor version of a frittata.

A nice twist on the omelette.  Changes that I made, mostly based on reading reviews, were to cook potatoes ahead of time, added green pepper, bacon, milk, and cheese in a cast iron skillet.  Had leftovers, so on day 2, added more cheese and ham.

Will make again, as it's ridiculously easy and not too time consuming.

I made this Sunday morning for St. Paddys. I loved the idea of it but wanted to spice it up. I used frozen southwest style potatoes and added sausage, cheese and a few spices. My kids are 7 and 3 and they loved it as well as my husband and I. We will be keeping up this tradition.

it might taste better than it looks.
