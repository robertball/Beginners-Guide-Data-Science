I kicked it up a notch by adding bonnet scotch.  I blended that with the tomatoes, onions, pepper in my vitamix first then continued with the receipe!

In the west indies it's also called "Bake and Saltfish."  I usually make the saltfish very much like you did, but I add a few cloves of minced garlic.  In NYC I ran across a deli that put shredded cabbage and carrots in the mixture; sounds kinda weird but it was fantasic!  I've made it at home just the same.  Kids and hubby loved it, and it helped stretch the saltfish, that is quite expensive in my area.

I tried it today... Left out the baking powder, added scotch bonnet AND cayenne pepper (I like my food spicy). They were PERFECT. It was my first time making them too. I even added (cooked) shrimp to some of the batter...

Oh lord, these are delicious! I added some jalepeno pepper because thats all the pepper I had on hand and a little bit of celery only because I need to use it up. SOOOOO GOOD! If I wasnt pregnant I would love to crack a red stripe beer and enjoy! You could mix up the vegetable adding sweet peppers etc. I also added maybe a few teaspoons more of water but I am assuming that is because my hubby didnt measure the flour proper. The amount of water / flour is basically spot on! I made my quite thick so I did cook about 7-8 min on each side and I also used olive oil, also all I had. I only boiled the fish for 5 min as directed and the amount of salt was perfect. Oh, I did add 1 teaspoon of vegetable bouillion as well - just for a tad more flavour! Hubby had 7 I had 3.. all gone in 5 min max!

I thought this was delicious.  Made a batch for Christmas morning breakfast and it was the bomb.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added scotch bonnet peppers.  Yum, yum, will definitely make again.

Very good.  Changed the water to milk and add one egg but otherwise made the recipe as written.  My son said it was the best he'd ever tasted - not that he's had fritters before :)

Sorry Monique C.  I followed this recipe and I didn't care for these.  They seemed to soak up alot of oil, making them pretty greasy.  I also thought they were kind of bland so I added some cayenne to kick it up a notch but it still didn't appeal to me.

I love fritters. When I make them, I usually add sweet pepper and hot pepper (country pepper), and I make the batter the same consistency as when making pancakes.

This recipe turned out SO well, I felt like I had been making the fritters for years! I added scotch bonnet peppers, and that gave it the kick that Jamaicans are accustomed to having. I actually made it for a multi-cultural expo at my church and EVERYBODY raved about them!

Yesss gyal!!! I've been wanting these forever but never knew how to make them and don't like the ones I've found in restaurants.  I made them last night as directed except added some scotch bonnet.  They were delicious! No one in my house really likes saltfish so I was lucky enough to be able to eat them all myself, and I sure did! Thank you

Overall, good recipe. Though I like my salt fish to have a bit of a salty taste so picked it apart then soaked it like my mother Beryl, did.  Plus it is a bit cheaper having to cook for a large family and can use less fish with more flavour.   Also, I don't like to boil the fish because it seems that it loses that nice cod fish flavour and it's so expensive!!   Then did a taste test before I mixed it up. I added more water (more moist) and less olive oil and cook it like a pancake and it cooks faster as well.  A litttle bit of thyme and grated carrots was added. Extra fiber never hurts and I love thyme.  Did a second batch with scotch bonnet, cumin and tumeric for the "hot" folks.  My daughter is purring while she eats.  She loves it.

this is oh so good. next time i will boil the saltfish three times instead of two; it was still too salty for my family taste. But otherwise it was good. I also added extra seasonings like sweet pepper, thyme, basil, cayenne pepper,onion chive

his is too much black pepper, should be cut by half teaspoon. And a bit more water is needed. usually Fritas are not so thick.
