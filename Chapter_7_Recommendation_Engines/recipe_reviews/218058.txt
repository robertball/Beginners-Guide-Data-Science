I did it slightly different according to what I had but it was still so good.  I used dried minced garlic, I did not have MSG and used a small amount of sea salt in its place.  Also low sodium soy sauce.  The mirin is what makes it imo.  I fried it up on the stove instead of doing it in the broiler.. fantastic flavor and my 4 and 6 year old loved it too with a bit of jasmine rice.

I thought this was pretty good. It kind of had both a sweet and salty taste. I used 3 NY strip steak, because it was all I had. I also just put the green onion directly in the marinade and used a sweet white wine I had. I put the meat on 6 skewers, with a generous 8-9 1" pieces of meat. They broiled in about 11 minutes, flipping twice.

This is a great recipe.  I used a bit more mirin and substituted fish sauce for the MSG.  I marinate for about an hour and used top sirloin.  We grill ours for about 2 minutes a side on a "steak hot" grill.
