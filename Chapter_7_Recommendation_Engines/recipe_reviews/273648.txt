This is delicious! I did a couple things differently though. I didn't thread bay leaves on the skewers in between the cubes of pork, because they kept breaking apart. So I scratched that, and used an orange bell pepper instead (worked really well! Highly recommend doing that!). I also used soaked bamboo skewers in place of metal skewers. Other than that, I kept everything else the same. Marinated the pork for about 36 hours, then cooked it on our charcoal grill for about 18 minutes. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend basting the skewers with the marinade--you'd be reintroducing raw pork 'juice' onto the cooked product, and that's just asking for trouble.

This is a great way to cook pork loin!  I often buy it on sale and freeze it.  During the summer, instead of cooking the loin whole, in the oven, dicing up the pork and grilling was a great solution .  I was pressed for time and marinated the pork for around 6 hours.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, I didn't thread the bay leaves, but instead used one in the marinade.  the kabobs were flavorful and zingy, even after my short marinating time.  Don't skimp on the fresh lemon.  It makes the dish.
