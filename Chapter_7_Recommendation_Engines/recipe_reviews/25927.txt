As is the recipe looked quite bland for my husband's and my tastes.  So I more than doubled the garlic, added a bit of lemon juice, was generous with the wine, and threw in lots of freshly grated black pepper.  I also was a bit mindful about limiting the amount of oil we used.  At the end, this dish turned out lovely!  The broth is beautiful especially when served with some steamed white rice or crusty garlic bread.  We loved it and will definitely make again, perhaps with just seafood next time - shrimp and scallops.  Thanks for the great meal!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It has quite a few steps but the end result is worth the effort.  I served over angel hair pasta.  I used chicken broth instead of water, doubled the garlic,  and added lemon pepper as extra seasoning. Topped with some freshly grated parmesan cheese. Fantastic pasta dish when prepared this way.

In my opinion, which, after all, is what these reviews are all about, a few tweaks elevated this from a four to a five star recipe. Using what I had on hand, I substituted some frozen green peas and red bell pepper for the mushrooms, and we LOVED those alterations â€“ they added such great flavor, not to mention making for beautiful, colorful eye appeal.  I winged it when it came to the sauce, adding more wine and chicken broth (a far superior option than water) as necessary.  I also swirled in some butter on low heat at the end, making the sauce rich and velvety smooth.   I served this over a tri-color capellini.  This was simply excellent and elegant.

To me, a recipe deserves a 4 or 5 star rating when it is good as is (not by adding 4 or 5 ingredients to make it better)... Apparently that's not how everyone on here feels, because yet again I am dissapointed, thinking that a recipe would just be good because of the rating it had. This was a bland recipe, I thought it was OK at best but my boyfriend and cousin didn't even give it that good of a review. We all wound up picking the shrimp out and dipping it in cocktail sauce to have some flavor.. I even added some cheyenne pepper to spice it up a little, it helped but not much.

This recipe was awesome with a few minor changes.  I added a little lemon juice, a lot more garlic, chicken bouillon instead of plain water (tips from other reviewers).  I also added a little Italian seasoning and some basil.  It turned out delicious.  I will be making this one again.

This was pretty good!  I didn't have any white wine so I just used chicken broth I also used the chicken broth in place of the water.  The default picture really doesn't do this recipe justice.  Based on the picture alone I wasn't going to try this recipe but I took a leap of faith and went with it and I am glad I did!

With some minor changes/additions this is a wonderful recipe.  Reduce the amount of oil and add it to the skillet, only as needed.  Saute the onion and garlic for 2 minutes before adding the shrimp to avoid overcooking. Also, avoid overcooking the chicken, as it will continue to cook, along with the shrimp, when simmered in the final step. We also combined the juice of 1 lemon with the water to make up the 1 1/4 cup measurement. The next time we may use chicken broth, as others have suggested.  Either way will be delicious!

Excellent Dish over Jasmin Rice. I upped the garlic, white wine and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added the juice of one lemon and 1/4 zest. I increased the shrimp and also added the stalk of one celery to the onion process. Fantastic and my family LOVED it.

This took alittle time to make, but was well worth it. Alittle extra sauce would of been nice. Next time will adjust for that. It is a keeper.

This recipe was great! I did make some changes, though. Like suggested before, instead of water I used 1 3/4 cup chicken broth, and since i didnt have any white wine, i added 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar and a tablespoon of basil. (I know this will make the sauce taste very different than intended, but it turned out great!) i served it over egg noodles and topped with diced tomatoes and parmesan cheese. Awesome!

Good easy recipe to make.  Question on how much water do you use to make it.  It's not specified.  I used 1 c. and it was fine.

I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs: hey, it's what I had on hand!  I added juice of one lemon along with zest from 1/2 of the rind and added to 1-1/2 cups of water rather than the 1-1/4 cups.  I also doubled the amount of garlic.  Thanks for a great basic recipe.

Absolutely delicious starter recipe.  I added paprika, garlic powder, and parsley flakes to my flour mix. The shrimp add a nice sweet bite.  Mine turned out slightly to thick for my liking, but I think that was my fault.   Will be making again, and soon.

First I used chicken broth instead of water and I felt the sauce still needed A LOT of seasoning added (basil, rosemary, Italian style) and I was only cooking for two so I used one large chicken breast pounded flat and cubed with about 10 large shrimp. I still used the full amount called for of wine and broth so I could serve it over pasta and have enough sauce for the pasta too. I think it will taste a lot better next time!

Very nice recipe; I also upped the garlic and wine and added lemon juice. Also, I sprinkled the chicken with lemon pepper and salt before dredging in flour. Served over brown rice, but I think it would've been much tastier with pasta or crusty bread. Also..."large skillet" was not large enough - I ended up transfering to a saucepan.

I followed this recipe to the T except I used only shrimp as I had no chicken in the house.  The recipe came out great, very flavorful.  I served this over linguine which was a nice addition.

This is a good recipe, but I did make a couple changes.  I used only about 3 T olive oil, and I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used canned, I used already-cooked shrimp and I upped the wine to 1/2 cup.  Also, I used 2 cups chicken broth instead of the 1 1/2 cups of water.  It's very good when it's eaten immediately, but not so good as leftovers because the pasta absorbs the sauce.

My girlfriend and I made this recipe last night with her wanting shrimp and me craving chicken.  We were both a little nervous at all the individual cooking steps and not exactly sure of what to expect when it was all said and done.  In my girlfriend's words "Wow this may be the best chicken I've ever had."  So I guess that about speaks for itself.

I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added some lemon juice. I wanted more vegetables so I added celery, frozen peas and some baby corn. It was delicious. Would definitely make it again.

Giving this 4 stars because it was good with some additions.  It definitely needed some changes otherwise would have been bland.  I doubled the wine, added lemon pepper seasoning and lemon juice and extra garlic and used chicken broth instead of water.

I thought that this was one of the best dishes I have made from an on-line recipe!!!  I boiled some rice and poured the dish over the rice!!!
I love it!

It has the potential to be a five. .  It is a little bland, the steps people mention were minor in my mind. I agree, use broth and possibly Lemmon Pepper.  Iâ€™ll avoid the traditional Italian Seasonings..  My family is no help as my wife, daughter and grand daughter donâ€™t cook.  Frustrated husband of 43 years ...

I tripled the recipe because we eat like pigs.  I added capers  for flavor, and parsley for color, because without it would be too  bland for us. Easy to make and fairly fast.  I'll make it again.

I added a lot more garlic and some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes too.  i didn't have wine, so i used chicken broth and some red wine vinegar.  served it over bow tie noodles and it was really yummy!

This is an awesome dish.  My husband and I both loved it.  I read some of the other reviews and I did substitute chicken broth for the water and I added more garlic.

It was ok. I used butter instead of oil to cook onions, shrimp and mushrooms. I used butter to make the rue too. I  added salt, pepper and paprika to the flour mixture. I added salt, pepper, and parm cheese to the sauce

My husband loved this. Chose to pair it with rice, but it was a little bland. Next time, I will serve with pasta in an olive oil, garlic, lemon, juice sauce or a light alfredo.

I tried this recipe and it was very delicious.  I did tweak it a little bit.  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2. For the 1 1/4 cup of water I added a vegetable bullion cube then I zested a lemon and put that in their along with 2 tbs of lemon juice and I used 1/2 cup of wine instead of 1/4 cup.  All in all it was pretty tasty and I would make it again

I try this recipe very good and delious recipe. I put my own little spin on the recipe. I omit the wine and use extra water instead. And I also use Goya Adobo to season the chicken and shrimp. I also use Goya Curry rice in a box. The meal was very good!! I had so many compliments about this dish. I also did like everyone else did I increase the garlic. I want to think the person who came up with recipe.

This was a hit in our house.  Prep time was worth it.  The only tweaking I did was to add more garlic and substitute low fat, low sodium chicken broth for the water since I had it on hand.  Served it with steamed asparagus and French bread. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!

Very good...reminded me of Olive Garden's "Chicken Vino Bianco".  Except they do not use the shrimp.  I used linguine in addition to the recipe and it was great.

A little time consuming, but it was very good.  I am trying to limit my carbs, so I did not serve it over rice.  However, I can imagine that it would have been even better if I did.

Pretty tasty, definitely fun to make, only thing is tastes similar to a frozen stir fry.
