Good recipe.  Not using the liquid reserve from the beans is a way to reduce the sodium content.  Dried thyme works well in place of fresh thyme.  I also cook a mixture of brown rice and white rice together to get more whole grains in my diet.

Outstanding flavor and i use cut cherry tomatoes which makes it sweeter.  I skip the rice to save calories. 4 weight watchers points.  Great with the lime.
