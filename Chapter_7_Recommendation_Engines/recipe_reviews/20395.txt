easy to make but because of the nutmeg and cinnamon used on the mangoes, it tastes more like apple bars.  I think next time I would omit the 2 ingredients mentioned.

My husband absolutly loved them! However I cut out the Nutmeg, and used Spelt flour instead of white flour-eek! ANd maple syrup instead of sugar.
They were delicious and a little healthier and much tastier than origonal recipie.

My husband thought it tasted like apple cobbler.. but we both LOVED it! I could taste the mango in the thicker slices and they went so well with the cinnamon and nutmeg spices. I'm really happy with this recipe and how it turned out that I'm emailing this link to all of my friends. The only thing I changed was the cook time. I had to pull it out after 50mins to avoid burned edges and covered the edges with foil half way through as I saw the edges darkening quickly. I baked it in a glass dish so I dont know if that had something to do with it.

This is very much like a mango cobbler except softer crust.  I like it ok, but I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg since most reviewers said it made it taste like apple cobbler.  This is very easy to cut into bars, and I used 3 different kinds of mangoes.  The sweeter,riper ones came out muuuuuch better than the more tart one.  If you have tart mangoes, you can add honey instead of white sugar.  Again, it was ok tasting, and I'm glad I tried it.

Wow! Very rich, wonderful taste. Gave some to my neighbor and she immediately wanted the recipe, as did her daughter. My only change was to substitute whole wheat flour for one of the three cups of all purpose, and I used cardamom instead of cinnamon. Slicing fresh mango is a messy affair (I used 3 large ones), so next time I may use canned mango (find it at an asian food mkt. or in the ethnic aisle at the store).

Though I am a health-conscious eater, this is an amazing recipe. The shortbread bars are just so delicious and scrumptious. The 60 minute baking time is perfect for that slight golden brown crisp. However, I used only 3.5 cups of mango (they were a little stringy but turned out great), only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and no nutmeg (I felt it was unnecessary because the cinnamon already spices the mango up). The most difficult part was slicing the mangoes. It took me about 1 hour to slice 4 medium-large mangoes, and it was a really big mess. I sliced them pretty thin, about 2-3 inches long and 0.5 inch wide. I was not familiar with baking shortbreads, so while I mixed the flour, butter, and sugar together I thought the mixture was too dry and began to panic.. but turns out it was supposed to be crumbly and crispy. Make sure you firmly press the flour mixture on the pan, and then evenly spread the mango mixture, then just use your hands and make the flour mixture into crumbs and sprinkle it on top of the mango. Press down lightly. Next time, I will try to substitute the butter for something else, possibly half olive oil and half butter. Also, because this shortbread reminds me of pie, on Thanksgiving or Christmas I will try substituting the mango for pumpkin and bake it in a round dish, see how that turns out :) I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us!

Very yummy, but the flavor of the mangoes is almost lost.  The only real indication is that they were the tiniest bit more tangy than apples.  Next time, I'll save money and substitute apples for the mangoes.  The shortbread is delicious!  Be careful about reserving part of the crumb mixture and not mixing it all in with the mangoes.  I halved the recipe w/o problems, but make sure to shorten the cooking time.

I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg and drizzled the top with honey instead. I also made a side crust and made the dish more of a shortbread tart than bars. Make sure to spread the shortbread out somewhat thinner than you would imagine correct, as it can easily get thick after baking. The flavor was good. The riper the mango the better. Would be great warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The mango is very mild in this recipe.  I think that is the nature of Mango when you cook it.   The shortbread is moist as opposed to the dry shortbread.  I had never had moist shortbread before.   this was good but not delicious.   However, my mother-in-law loved it because she loves shortbread.  
I had a hard time getting the shortbread mixture on top of the mango.  can't really spread it.  I just dropped it on and spread it as best I could.

Easy and yummy! My family loves the mango fruit so I always pick some up at the store. I'm never sure of what to do with it though besides slice it up and serve it with ice cream or something. Then I found this recipe, and my family requests this for dessert once a week at least. NOTE: I usually do half just like the recipe calls for and the other half with strawberries and blueberries instead of mango (same spices though). Great recipe!

I only had one mango, so I haved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 inch dish for 30 minutes.  It's very good.  I love the combo of spices on the mango.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Quite excited to try it as we all love mangos, but it came out very dry and lacking much flavour.  Perhaps with some modifications I'd try it again.

The crust used in this recipe is so perfect and it can be used in other recipes that call for a crust as well. I've tried many recipes that lacked a good crust but now that I have this recipe, I plan on using it instead.  My only change: I added fresh raspberries in with the mango.  Eat warm with ice cream to fully appreciate it.

Delicious! The crust tastes like shortbread, but it bakes up more like a cobbler. Not very mango-y (tastes a little like peach cobbler), but still a fantastic dessert - especially served warm over ice cream. I also added a sprinkle of brown sugar and cinnamon to the top, before it went into the oven.

Wow, this is much better than I would have ever guessed, even after reading reviews!  I substituted ground ginger for nutmeg and I through in a handful of raspberries for color.  It is so delicious.  I found using a butter wrapper helped with pressing the mixture down into the pan.  You have to try this!!

Aloha,

This is an absolutely wonderful, scruptious, easy - just plain yum.  I bought fresh Mangos at our local farmers market whipped it up last night. No need to change anything about the recipe. My family loved it, the guys at work went crazy over it!  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a hard one for me to rate. I give the shortbread part 5 stars and the filling 3 stars. This is a very good recipe to use up some mangos, but mango used this way is just not for me. I will be using the crust part and trying this with different fruit.

I have made this shortbread twice now and it is so delicious.  The second time I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour and enjoyed it even more; warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup drizzled over it all!  Dealing with the mango can be labor intensive but it is so worth the effort.  Like one reviewer before me said, "the riper the mango the better".  Definitely one of my favorites from this sight so far.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made exactly as directed. I was dissappointed. We love mango, so hated the huge expense and waste of them! I am giving this two stars as it sounds like some did like it, I had 3 guest for dinner and they were not a hit.

These are great!  I did halve the recipe because I didn't have as many mango as it called for.  I also diced the mango instead of slicing.  The shortbread was very good, and could even stand alone I believe.

DELICIOUS! So simple and perfectly sweet, definitely an item that goes well with tea. I used a pan that was a bit smaller, and should have cooked it for another good 5 minutes but regardless it tasted FINE. This is a great recipe to substitute the mangos for just about anything (apples or peaches), yet the mangos give a good seasonal twist.

This is a good way to use leftover mangos or any other ripe fruit. We bought six mangos at Costco that were about to go bad, which is why I made these bars. They were very easy to make and simple. One caveat: I think this is more a fall/winter recipe; the shortbread is quite heavy and dense.

It was great. I only had about 3 cups of mango so I added crushed pineapple (didn't have anything else). Turned out really delicious.

Wonderful recipe! I took it to work (so I wouldn't be tempted to eat it all myself) and it was a hit.

Rave reviews from the family! I didn't use any of the spices,e but I really hate cinnamon. It would be nice to mix in some brown sugar with the mangos next time. Also, you  really need to make sure that the mangos you use do not have aren't stringy inside. Carry mangos are the best. Make sure you cut the mangos over a bowl to preserve the juice for the recipe and avoid a big mess. For the real sweet tooth, add more sugar. Overall, a nice change from the ordinary and very filling.

I made this and used the suggestion of having only one mango. Someone that doesn't like mangos that much enjoyed this.  I have requests to make it again.  I also thought about using Peaches next time.

This is a great recipe. I nice combination of traditional baking with a tropical flare. It surprises first time tasters that are expecting apple or peaches. As with most deserts this goes great with ice cream (what doesn't right?).

Tried the recipe again today. Turned out even better than the first time. I used half of the recipe, like others did, and cut the time shorter by some twenty minutes. Definitely a delicious recipe. Thanks for the recipe :)

These were good, very unique.  I felt the shortbread part was a little dry so next time I would increase sugar or cut back on flour.  I used frozen mango which didn't allow for a "sauce" to form, in the future I would thaw them or use fresh.  I used cardamom and cinnamon for the spices, very good.

Good.  A not-too-sweet dessert.  Too mushy when I tried it with canned peaches though.

Great shortbread, with a yummy topping.  It would work better with peaches, I think.

I didn't like this that much, but it wasn't bad.  It does remind me of apple crisp, like another reviewer said, and I prefer the oatmeal topping on crisp desserts.  Mine was somewhat sour, as my mango wasn't too ripe, so adding more sugar would've made it better.

A really easy recipe that presents itself as being complex. I brought it to my office and got rave reviews. I personally think it could be more buttery flavored, but I used a margerine type butter. Next time I will certainly use the real thing. I also think peaches or nectarines would be two good fruits to try it with.
