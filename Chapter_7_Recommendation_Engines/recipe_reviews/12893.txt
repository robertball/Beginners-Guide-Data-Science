This is a great soup, but I did make some minor changes.  I had 2 frozen turkey legs that I partially cooked on the stove with the 4 cups of water and some chicken bouillon.  While that was cooking, I chopped the carrots, celery, and onion and put them in a crockpot.  I added the turkey legs (whole) and the broth and let that cook on high for a few hours.  I then cut the meat off the bone and added it back to the crockpot along with frozen corn and a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower and some rice.  Just before serving, I added the can of cream of chicken soup, but no cheese.  My kids loved it and it is definitely a comfort food type of soup that I will make again.

This is an exceptionally great soup.  I
generally don't approve of Velveeta, but
in this case, I wouldn't try anything else
It is one of my family's favorites,
especially on a cold winter's night.

Ok Ok.  This is an absolute awesome recipe!!!  Here's what I did to make it even better!!  First I poached my turkey.  Used 3 turkey thighs, filled a big pot with water & a cup of chicken broth, waited for the water to boil,then put in my diced potatoes, cut up veggies & the 3 turkey thighs.  Bring water down to a simmer, cover with lid and don't touch for 30 mins. I poured the water/chicken broth into a gravy strainer, and poured 4 cups of skimmed liquid into my croc pot.  Put 1 can each Cream of Chicken & Cheddar soup {substitute for cubed cheese} & mixed it with a wire whip.  Cut my turkey to mouth size bites & put in the croc.  Added a half bag of Green Giant frozen mixed veggies, set on low for 4 hours.  Didn't add the onions for no particular reason, will add next time.  By far the most tender turkey I have ever had in soup.  Incredible.  Snowin' like mad here {Massachusetts} & sittin' back with a hot & hearty soup!!!  TY Melody!!!!!

I made this soup using left-over turkey and it went over well with my family.  I love recipes that let me sneak in vegetables that they normally turn their noses up to, like broccoli.  The only thing I added was a healthy dose of ground red pepper.  Thank you for sharing.  

On edit:  The leftover soup was so thick that I used it for pot pie. I mixed 1 stick butter, 1 cup milk, and 1 c self-rising flour and poured it over the soup.  Baked 350 for 1 hour.  It was wonderful.

omg, is this soup yummy! i made my broth & took meat from a turkey breast carcass. from there, i followed the recipe exactly as written except for using fresh (blanched) broccoli & adding 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper. borden's "american singles" processed cheese worked very well. you'll discover this soup is even more delicious when served the next day! thank you melody!!

This soup was excellent. I made it as recommended and it was delicious. Even my kids 4,3 and 3 liked it....veggies and ALL! They were a little suspicious of the broccoli at first, but once they tasted it in the cheesy soup they were sold. My son ate 2 bowls! My husband loved it as well. It is a great soup if you just want some comfort food on a cold day or to use up veggies you have sitting around. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I didn't use cheese mainly because I forgot to buy it but also because I won't use processed cheese.  I had cooked a turkey breast for Thanksgiving, so I took some of that meat off and shredded it into the soup.  I sprinkled some cheddar on the top.  It is so good, and it warms up well (probably better without the cheese).  Perfect with a half baguette on a cold fall day.

This is a tough one for me to rate. I really, really like the flavor of the soup, but for some reason, I didn't like the turkey in it. It just seemed out of place for some reason. The dark meat just kind of stood out to me, not in a good way. It's odd because I really like turkey, I swear! I ended up eating around all the turkey and really enjoyed the soup. I wasn't in the mood for broccoli so I threw in some fresh mushrooms instead and I cubed up a block of cheddar instead of using Velveeta. I might try this again but will probably use chicken instead. Thanks :)

I loved this recipe!  I got all kinds of raves at work.  I did make some changes though:  since I made it around thanksgiving, I used leftover turkey. Also to use up some leftovers, I used leftover gravy instead of one can of soup.  Definitely a soup to repeat in our house.

Even the kids, who don't usually like soup, liked this one.  I used all fresh veggies, diced turkey I had in the freezer, and added shredded cheddar cheese at serving time as I didn't have processed cheese.  We'll make this one again.

Fixed this soup today, delicious!!!! My husband loved it. I only prepared half of the recipe. Did not have any celery, added some celery salt to the soup. Very rich and filling. Will make often this winter since I still have leftover turkey breast in the freezer. Will substitute chicken broth for the water.

Delicious soup!... I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and recently started to make my own cream soup base to skip the msg in canned soups (cream soup recipe on this site).  I used about 2 1/2 cups of turkey and added some chicken boillon to my water.  I made it thick because that's the way my family likes it!  I will definately make this again!  left out the broccoli because I didn't have any, but the celery, carrots and potatoes were enough!  Thanks!

I LOVE this soup!  I have used chicken broth and left over turkey (instead of boiling just the legs) and it takes great! Great texture very hearty!  Great meal!  I love it!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It was very simple to make and my toddler had TWO bowls ;). I ended up using chicken tenders instead of turkey and I baked the chicken and then     diced it and added it in with the potatoes and carrots. I omitted the frozen veggies and used 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water. I will definitely be making this again soon!! Thanks for this recipe.

Perhaps if I had followed the directions more exactly I would have wound up with the "super soup" that everyone else is raving about.  Unfortunately, I wanted to make a big pot and used over 2 qts of water and my huge leftover turkey.  Added 3 cans chicken broth to get some flavor.  Then my mistake.. I hate celery, so I diced it in my food processor. That was alright, but I also diced my carrots and onions in there.  End result (after 3 cans cream of chicken / 1 can cream of celery/ half pound of velveeta / half lb cheddar /some parmesan and romano and mounds of seasoning) was basically a slightly cheesy, creamy broth with mini chunks of potato and a few veggies. (Oh yeah, I ended up using 1 lb mixed frozen and 1 lb green beans.) I doubt I'll do this again, I prefer my usual, entirely homemade (i.e. no cans of soup and processed cheese!) turkey, lentil, and barley soup, but if I did, I promise to follow the recipe!! Thanks anyway. Cheers!

WOW! This is a great soup. I did make a few adjustments to suit my family's taste.  I used my leftover turkey carcass from Thanksgiving to get the broth.  Boiled this most of the day and got a really rich stock with plenty of meat that fell off the bones.  Also I only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and used shredded cheese instead of the processed stuff.  I used frozen green beens for the vegetable and added a tablespoon of coarsely ground black pepper for a little spice.  I served this tonight with the French Bread recipe from this site along with a salad and chocolate cake for dessert.  It was definitely a hit with my family.

I made this in a crockpot. Used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. Added thyme, pepper and sage to enhance the soup flavor. Also used a tip from a previous review to use some parmesean cheese - as well as 1/2 of the called for processed cheese. VERY good flavor. Thank you!

Wonderful recipe to experiment with - I used leftover turkey from Christmas, and 1 15oz can each of chicken broth and water instead of the 4 cups of water.  Also, I did not have all of the veggie ingredients, so I used what I had in the freezer:  mixed veggies for soup that included okra, corn, green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, and lima beans among other things.  I used 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of celery (to make up for the lack of actualy celery), and also added 1/2 cup of brown rice and some Old Bay Seasoning.  I cooked and stirred until the rice was done, adding almost a second can of chicken broth to keep it soup-like.
Had the leftovers the next day in homemade turkey pot pie (suggested by another reviewer)
Thank you for this really good recipe for me to play with!

I loved this soup.  Me and my daughter were arguing over the last bit of soup, and I really was supposed to take it to my mother's house.  I made it 2 days after thanksgiving.  I froze the rest of my turkey meat that was left over and I am making it again this weekend.  Maybe some of it will actually make it to my mom's house.

This is an awesome, creamy recipe!  My 5yo had 3 bowls, 3yo had 2!  We scaled back on the cream of chicken (1can) and half the cheese, as I didn't want it to be too thick.  I also used a turkey cutlet, half chicken broth/half water, and added pepper, fresh rosemary, basil, and sage! yum!

This was a yummy soup that was great for leftover turkey.  I used leftover dark meat and 2 cans of chicken broth with about 1/2 cup of water rather than the 4 cups of water called for.  Also added pepper.  We really enjoyed it!

Loved this!  Used leftover turkey breast and swapped out one of the cans of cream of chicken for cream of broccoli...okay and maybe added some extra potato...but this one is definitely a keeper!  Perfect for these cold New England days!

What a great way to use up left over turkey legs!  I used fresh broccoli, and I added fresh rosemary and parsley along with salt and pepper and this was about the best soup I have ever made.  I lightened it up a bit using low fat soup and cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great soup that will make you look like a super chef! I used cut-up chicken breast with a can of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. This is my favorite soup recipe!  Makes great leftovers as well.  Great!!

great for the whole family, my 7 year old cried the entire time i was making it, saying he wouldnt like it, then i made him take a bite, and he gobbled it up, and asked for 2nds!, instead of carrots or frozen brocoli, i used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and i used left over turkey with chicken broth to replace the water since i didnt cook my turkey in it! yummy!!

Was quite condensed, had to add milk to thin, but all in all quite good.

I changed several ingredients in this recipe because of what I had on hand (1 can cream of celery soup, leftover turkey) and because I don't use cheese products like Velveeta, I substituted some grated asiago cheese instead, and used some celery salt, all-purpose seasoning salt, oregano, basil, 3 peppercorns, and poultry seasoning powder in the water before adding the canned soups.  I also left out the potatoes because I was nearly out of room in the saucepan.  Delicious and easy!  My husband wanted me to try some kind of creamy turkey soup instead of the traditional broth based with our leftovers.  We all loved it, even our 1-year-old son.  Thanks Melody!  I will make it again when we have turkey leftovers.

Very good!  I've tried other soups to throw my leftover turkey in, but this is the best I've tried so far.

I like it but made some changes.  I used cut up chicken legs to make the stock. I skipped the onion and used a hard grated cheese rather than Velvetta. I added fresh brocoli and cooked it in the pot. I used a mixer to make everything smooth and then added chicken. INstead of cream of chicken soup I used a little goat cheese. Yummy!

Husband loved it he's just trying and learning to love veggies. I used chicken broth I had frozen. Then used left over smoked turkey from holidays and substituted cheese soup and left over cream cheese ball about 1 oz maybe plus 1/2 cup of cheddar for the Velveeta it was plenty of cheese.  Also added red pepper flakes. Going in recipe box for sure. Thank you!

I'm a cheese-lover, so am surprised at how really good this was even though I only had a few slices of cheese on hand!

This was so good! It's  very creamy, my in laws said I could sell this in a restaurant. I used chicken breast and it didn't make a difference. Love the recipe, wouldn't change a thing about it.

I tried this recipie with my leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving.  It was very hearty and soooooo easy to make.  I added a bit of pepper for taste and didn't use potatoes, but all-in-all a recipie I will use again.

I added larger amounts of vegitables than called for, reduced the cheese by 1/3, and put in 1 tbsp. Season All (I found it somewhat bland without the Season All).  My husband described it as "hearty" and had a second helping.
