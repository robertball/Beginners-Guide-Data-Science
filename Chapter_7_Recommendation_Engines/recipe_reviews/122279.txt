I've been on a low carb/low fat/high protein diet, so I too exchanged cottage cheese for the cream cheese.  Only had 2 cups of 2% mexican cheese mix so also added italian turkey sausage to keep up the protein.  This was very good and filling for a low carb/low fat recipe!

Great recipe!  I've been making the other "Crustless Spinach Quiche" on this website for quite some time and had been meaning to try to make a lower-fat version.  This one is really good!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I didn't have broccoli or mushrooms.  I did add a bit of salt, but it's probably not needed.  Next time I will definitely try it with broccoli, maybe saute the onion in a tiny bit of oil and mix up the cheeses.  I thought the cream cheese was a very nice touch!  It's a keeper for sure, and will replace its less healthy evil twin recipe....at least most of the time!

Yummy! This is my first attempt at quiche so I was quite nervous. I baked them in muffin tins because I don't have a quiche pan and they turned out great. I filled them almost to the top and just cut the baking time down to about 30 mins. Keep an eye on them just in case.   I also added some shredded carrot, minced garlic, and a diced jalapeno to the recipe. Topped them off with half a cherry tomato. Beautiful and delicious!

My boyfriend and I are on a very low carb diet...soI modified the recipe a bit tocut carbs...instead of milk I used heavy wipping cream which has zero carbs, I omitted te onion and brocoli, and used slightly less spinach...we had large turkey legs left over so we cut the meat off and chopped it down to small pieces sauteed the meat in a pan and addded that to the quiche...very low carb and very delicious!

OK, but it needs some tinkering with additional spices - I used oregano and garlic and onion powder.  Be sure to really drain the water out of your spinach; I didn't do a very good job of it and was left with a little liquid pool at the bottom of the plate.

This is a recipe that tastes great that I don't feel guilty making - no heavy cream, eggs, or regular cheese. I've made it twice and everybody loved it. It's easily adaptable. I used 3 cups chopped fresh spinach instead of the frozen spinach and broccoli. No problem with it being watery. Also used lowfat colby instead of cheddar. Used 4 oz cream cheese as it came in 8 oz container so I used half of it. Just a wonderful basic recipe that you can do a lot with.

Used the actual quiche part. Fat free milk, reduced fat cream cheese and egg sub.. Used fresh spinach instead of frozen, used 1/2 grated carrot and half mushrooms.  Very good quiche for so low fat.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I'll use the quiche part a lot and just experiment with different fillings.

I sauteed the onion and mushrooms with garlic in a little olive oil.  I used fresh broccoli, steamed a little.  I used only one cup of cheese.  Instead of egg substitute, I used two eggs and added a heaping tablespoon of flour.  It's a family favorite!

great recipe! I love the alternative high protein and lower calorie option to the original. Instead of broccoli we added zucchini, which turned out very well and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Super good!

This was a very good, easy recipe! I substituted low fat cottage cheese for the cream cheese b/c that's all I had. I sauteed the onion with a few cloves of garlic before adding to the veggies, and added a grated carrot as some have suggested. Didn't have mushrooms, although they'd be great in this, as would zucchini, red bell peppers, corn, etc. I also did not have 3 C. of cheddar, so I used about 1.5 C. cheddar and 1/2 C. feta and it was plenty cheesy. This definitely benefits from some spices--a dash of cayenne, garlic powder, oregano-have fun experimenting. My family liked the "mini quiches" (baked in a muffin pan) very much. Will make again!

This is an absolutely delicious quiche. I used a sharp cheddar which gave it a little more bite, and omitted the mushrooms. It's a good recipe to make because most of the ingredients I always have on hand in the fridge and freezer. My 8 yr. old daughter loved it. FYI...it reheats really well.

I use fresh garlic and saute it with the spinach.  I also use 1/2 egg beaters.  It's a wonderful recipe and I'm always asked how to make it when I bring it to a brunch.

Good and easy!  Quick to make, these are ingredients I always have in the house.  I used a whole 10oz box of frozen broccoli, instead of just the cup.  My 1 year old loved it too!

i love this recipe. our church community group often selects "breakfast" as our theme, and i used to have the hardest time finding ways to fit green vegetables and fiber into what they serve there :) now i bring this and it is a refreshing change from the usual sugar, fat and carbs! it's delicious, too.

This is a good recipe that is easily altered for what you have. I have tried this before and today I made it with fresh spinach and swiss chard that I blanched slightly. I sauteed the onions with garlic and added them and the greens right before stuffing it in the oven. 
I've replaced the cream cheese with plain yogurt of both regular and greek variety and have used regular milk or butter milk.
I think the quantity of egg versus cheese versus soft cheese and liquid is what's important and this one gets that part right every time. Just cook it in a glass dish so that you know the bottom is brown (crusty) before you take it out and you are good.
Im going to try adding meats next time- bacon or ham. MMMMM.....

Very good. When using fresh spinach (as I did) you need a min of 2 cups. I left out the onions/mushrooms, still tasted good.

This was delicious and very diet friendly! I used FF cream cheese, 1 cup of egg whites, and all spinach because I didn't have broccoli. It turned out very creamy. I also added 1/4 tsp. salt and will add a little more next time. Definitely a great addition to my meatless menus.

I made this for myself for lunch today and I really enjoyed it. I subbed cottage cheese for the cream cheese, added a few spices, including cayenne and sprinkled the top with paprika. It poofed up so nicely in the oven; almost like a souffle! Can't wait to have this for breakfast tomorrow. Thank you Vicki!!

This was really tasty.  Even my boyfriend who hates low fat anything liked it.  I only had 2 cups of cheese so I added about 2 tablespoons of grated romano cheese.

I thought the flavor on this was really good--I bumped the heat up to 400 the last few minutes to try and brown the top--I used parm and feta instead of shredded cheese and it worked great.  Everyone loved it.

One of the few hot meals I can get my 2 year old to eat.
