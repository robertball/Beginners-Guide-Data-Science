Eggs, cheese, bacon. How can you go wrong with these ingredients? I'm nicknaming this cheaters quiche Lorraine. I used French bread, chopped sweet onions, and added Rosemary at the end. I also double or triple the amount of cheese.

I used green onions instead of chives and added salt and pepper. This was a very good cheesy meal! Would make again and I love that it only makes a small casserole size!

This an amended recipe based upon one from the ‘70’s.

Unless you’re on a restricted diet, I see no reason to not use a full egg for fluff and richness.  I usually use sourdough bread for this Recipe for better texture.  This casserole is always a winner with fresh OJ or fresh fruit.

I have a bit of a cholesterol problem, so using egg-beaters (real egg whites with beta carotene for color) is great!  They cut calories as well.  This great recipe is awesome to prepare ahead, so in the morning I can focus on getting ready for the day.  Folks who don't try the recipe because of the egg-beaters, and yet give it a bad review are not working within the spirit of this site.

I think this is a great guideline for a simple breakfast casserole, but it needs a little creativity. Maybe use swiss, pepper jack or montery jack cheese(Maybe along with a little salsa for a Mexican based casserole)  and real eggs. Pancetta instead of bacon, maybe, and some veggies like bell peppers or green chiles. Also, maybe using brioche or croissants for the bread.
Lastly, the name. If you add casserole to the end of anything, it could make it seem like you're making something with canned green beans and cream of mushroom soup :( .  I would call it  Eggs Bacon.

This was a nice way to end the day. It was assembled prior to leaving the house for work and baked 9 hours later. It was light and tasty. If made again, I will add some red peppers for color and green onions for a little more flavor.

Didn’t care for this. The bread in the middle was a little weird. Next time I will use torn up bread and real eggs. It was easy to make. Just needs a little something else.

And yes, I added Onion & Garlic Powder to 6 eggs instead of the original stuff.  I used thinly cut Green Onions, too. Dash of salt & pepper.
I did not have sliced Sourdough so I used Sourdough Buns and broke them up, adding them to the bottom of the pan. Worked out tasty & awesome for my company. I served it with fresh, sliced Avocados, Melon wedges, Sour Cream & Fresh Salsa. Great hit

I didn't have a glass dish so I had to use nonstick. That being said I only chilled out for 6 hours. I used precooked bacon and real eggs. I used 5 eggs total. I really liked the flavor until now afterwards I have metal mouth. Also it was very mushy I'm the middle but with great crisp at the edges.  I will make it again with a glass dish and see how it goes.

I didn’t have bacon and substituted ham and used herbs de Provence in place of green onions. It was fabulous!
