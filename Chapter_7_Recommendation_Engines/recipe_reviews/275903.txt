Chef John is definitely correct ... this is much better served cold. This recipe has a lot less flour than an old recipe I use for cherry clafoutis and is much more like a custard than a cake.  Used goat milk as I didnâ€™t have any regular whole milk and it was great.  The almonds were delicious.  Will make again. I will try and attach a photo

What a wonderful dessert!  I made it in my new enameled cast iron braiser.  I only had self-rising flour so I used that.  It really looked like it had a crust because the bottom was golden brown!  This will be my go-to special dessert for when company comes over.

Did not make any changes to the recipe.  A really beautiful desert and a nice change of pace with pears.  Appropriate for any season.

Didn't have any almonds, or either extract on hand, so I made do without!  Nothing a shot of Marsala can't fix.  I also used soy drink instead of milk.  Came out delicious.  My pears were so sweet, I could have even cut down on the white sugar and it still would have been tasty.

So, if you think pears taste good, then try granny smith apples.  Add a touch of vanilla with cinnamon to this dish.  You will be saying, "Oh my goodness"!!!   Thanks, Chef John!

This is a delicious, light dessert and a great way to use up those pears in the fridge that might go bad before you get around to eating them, even though you had the best intentions to get more fruit in your diet. Pear Clafoutis to the rescue!  This is so easy and does taste great chilled.  I made it to the recipe with just one minor substitution.  I was out of almond extract, so I added a splash of brandy.  An inspired substitution!  The flavor blended wonderfully with the pears and chopped almonds.  I felt very French eating it!  Bonus-the recipe is easy to adjust for the number of pears that you have on hand.  I will be saving this recipe to make again.

This dish looks great and smells good.  The texture could be better though, as Carrie commented.  I think the problem is that this dish should be a custard, and the excessive flour detracts from that.  Rather than the smooth texture of a custard, it is rougher, with a bread-like texture.  It would be better with just a little flour, maybe a couple tablespoons.

Yes.  A nice, fairly light dessert, even though I used a cup of milk and 1/4 cup of cream.  My pears were very ripe and I needed to use them up, so I gave this a try.  Yes, I will make it again.

Bland and unpleasant texture..although it looked beautiful, that was as far as it got...one bite, and that was enough for my whole family.  Never again.

I used apples instead of pears.  I kept all seasoning but added cinnamon.  Everyone loved it!  Will make this one again!

Simply followed the directions and it came out perfectly! So easy to make, and I only had a 9 inch pan! My pears weren't super sweet and I think I maybe could've put just a little more sugar on top of the decor pears. Definitely delicious served cold, after letting the pan cool a bit I just stuck the whole thing in the fridge.
