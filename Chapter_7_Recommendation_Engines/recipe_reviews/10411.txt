My welsh friend tells me that they should be baked on top of the stove on a griddle (I DO MINE ON A LARGE FRY PAN I DONT HAVE A GRIDDLE) couple of minutes each side on a medium heat. Place on a plate with a clean tea cloth over till cool, then place in airtight container till required, but the wont last long. spread with butter, yummmmm

My daughter made these as a "Welsh" dish for a school program on immigration.  My main problem with the recipe is that it is somewhat unclear.  The ingredient list calls for one quarter cup milk, yet the direction is for you to beat the egg in a cup measure and add milk to the one quarter cup line.  That ended up being much less than a quarter cup of milk.  The other criticism is that there is no time given for baking.  We baked the cookies about until golden brown (25 minutes) and they came out too hard and dry.

Not a bad cookie, but I wouldn't go to the trouble again with the kneading and cutting.

Unfortunately the directions are not clear enough especially when people have never had Welsh tea cake.    Definitely make on a griddle - otherwise the results are far from good.

Scotaway is correct.  Welsh cakes should be cooked on a bake stone but a frying pan or electric griddle works well.  Welsh cakes also have currents, not raisins.  My cousin also adds a tablespoon of of decicated coconut if she she is mailing them away to help keep them fresher longer.  For egg alergy, I have used 1/4 cup applesauce instead of egg, it worked very well. Glenys

I boil the raisins for a few minutes till soft and drain them well to make it eaiser to work with. then drain well. Dust with sm amt of flour. A great recipe.

My only problem with this recipe is that raisins are too fat for a rolled cookie so I used currants instead. I also experimented with other liquids I could use instead of milk. Pumpkin pie filling and condensed tomato soup worked well. Yes, tomato soup!

I used to have an authentic Welsh Cake recipe, cooked on a griddle, but it has been misplaced.  I tried this recipe to replace it; it is probably easier, being baked in the oven and turning out more like a cookie, but the taste is as I remember from the recipe I used to have, and the directions are clear and simple.

I might do these again using a griddle. I followed the directions and they are more like a cookie. They are very fluffy and they do taste good.

I did mine in the oven, They turned out fine. As far as the bake time, I did mine about 10 minutes and checked them. Still not brown enough I added another 5 minutes for a total of 15 minutes. Turned out fine.

Great recipe I followed it exactly except I did add a little bit more sugar. Just taste your dough and tweak it to your taste. Other than that this tea cake recipe is a keeper!

Bought some Welsh Tea Cakes at a Celtic Fair last year and have been excited about trying to make these at home. The texture was just right. Plan to use this recipe as my base for experimenting with different flavor combinations.
