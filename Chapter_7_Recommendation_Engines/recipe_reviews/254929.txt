Light, fresh and delicious! I did eyeball the oil and lemon juice (to taste) and added just a bit of salt, but those were my only changes. I was skeptical of this one, but it's really, really good! I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added a bit more spinach than the recipe calls for and probably should have added even more. I used a Quinoa/Bulger Wheat blend also.

This is good, but kind of bland.  In the future, I'll add salt and pepper to the dressing at the very least.  Maybe some cayenne or basil or mustard or something, too.  As written, the feta pretty much overpowers all of the other flavors.

Very good salad - even the kids liked it!  I did not make the dressing, but instead, used Lemon Chia bottled dressing.  Could really substitute any dressing.  I have so many bottled dressings already, I didn't need to make a separate dressing for this salad.  Healthy and yummy!  We add the dressing to our individual salad bowls so that leftovers don't get soggy.
