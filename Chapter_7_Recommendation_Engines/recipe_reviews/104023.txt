This is absolutely the best punch.  I have made it for my family in the most casual setting but yet for a baby shower in a very formal setting.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!

I love this punch.  I make it at least once a week.  It is very refreshing.

absolutely YUMMY! and very refreshing!!! we sampled this at the Diabetes Expo this past wknd and the entire family LOVED it - so when we got home i made a batch - all ready have made 3!! lol  its so nice to have something taste so good w/o sacrificing taste and still being able to watch your overall sugar!  thanks!
