This recipe turned out great. I've always loved pickled peppers but as I've gotten older the seeds don't love me. Using this recipe I was able to discard the seeds from the pepper rings and put the majority of them  in the bottom of the jar for heat. So now I can eat to my hearts content without any ill after affect. Awesome!

Fairly easy recipe to make. I was amused how spicy the carrots and onions got compared to the relative mildness  of the Jalapenos.  I will adjust the number of the Jalapenos based on the sizes available as they vary.  The very ripe red Jalapenos worked as well as the more common green ones.
