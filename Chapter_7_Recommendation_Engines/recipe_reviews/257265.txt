The idea is adorable, however the frosting is super sweet and with the sugar cookie cup makes it a little too much to handle. I changed up the way it was put together by filling the shallow cups with shredded coconut adding just a little frosting on top and drizzling melted chocolate over the top to keep everything together.

I used store bought cookie mix, baked it by the tablespoon full in a mini muffin tin, undercooked it ever so slightly, & used the end of my French rolling pin to compress the center into a cup shape.
Then I filled the cups with Swiss meringue buttercream flavored coconut and dipped them in toasted coconut flakes.
Such a cute idea and a big hit both times Iâ€™ve made them. Thank you for sharing!
