My family loved these. I made a couple small changes to the patties, though: 1 tsp sriracha instead of chili paste and 1 pinch red pepper flakes. It was plenty of heat for us.

Too much heat. Next time I will go with half the sambel oelek and only half a teaspoon of pepper flakes. Otherwise good flavor. Didn't use breadcrumbs and it held just fine.

Really really good. I know itâ€™s a lot of ingredients but so worth it.  If kids are eating these be aware the sauce is spicy. We have a mixed family of spicy lovers. Half of us like spicy and half do not. So we made the sauce as is and halved it. One half was as is and the other half we added more mayo to in order to take away most of the heat for the little ones.  Goes great with applesauce on the side. We all enjoyed these a lot.

This is a favorite recipe at my house, which is impressive considering I am married to a meat'n'potatoes loving southern man! Wouldn't change a thing!
