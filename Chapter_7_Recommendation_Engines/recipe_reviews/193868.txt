My kids and husband have been declaring these "the best muffins ever." I do admit we are a healthy household, i usually make whole wheat no sugar added kinds of things, and we don't like super sweet food. Given that background, we love these, they are soft inside, crunchy outside, and a good snack size when mini. I think they're just sweet enough but this is what I did: I used brown rice flower instead of white and my coconut was sweetened, because that's what I had on hand.

I'm surprised how good they are for so little ingredients. I added a bit of baking soda to make them fluffier and some dried cranberries for sweetness (skipped the sugar). Love them.

Overall - a tasty alternative to those avoiding wheat/canola oil in their cooking.   We have cut out processed wheat in our diet as it packs on the pounds and try to limit our sugar intake, so baking a treat becomes a challenge.  Coconut oil (in coconut milk) is a good fat that burns bad fat, so this makes this a bonus for baking!  We did use sweetened coconut (on hand and needed to be used up), decreased salt to 1/2 tsp of salt and sprinkled on "whey low" - a natural sugar alternative that tastes like sugar,  but low on glycemic index.  Added 3 chocolate chips in about 1/4 of the mini muffin cups (YUM!) for an extra special treat.   They slid right out of the silicone cups.  I forgot they wouldn't rise, so I filled the cups 2/3 and they came out short, and may have even fallen.  Next time I will fill the cups all the way.  This recipe is a great base to start with, though good on its own.  We will be making these again!

These muffins are dense and crisp on the outside moist and soft on the inside.  I prepared them just as the original recipe reads- the flavor is a very delicate coconut taste- delicious.  I pureed some of the raspberries we just picked and my children used that as a dipping sauce they LOVED this as a mid morning snack.

Disappointing. The inside were glue-like (calling that "moist" is a stretch). The only flavor "hit" arrives when you chew on a piece of the shredded coconut.

It came out really dense and bland.  I pretty much threw away the whole batch.  I will not be making these again.

I used glutinous rice flour as that was all I could find at the grocery store - I think it was the reason the muffin stuck to the wrapper. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the muffins before baking. I also think that this muffin needs a bit of something else, but it is a great starter recipe, especially for those with allergies.

Sorry..this was not as tasty as some reviews are saying, they are however very easy to make and Gluten Free which is a great thing but even my husband (who is G.F. ) didn't like them enough to want me to make another batch!!!

This turned out so yummy! As always, I made some modifications based off other reviews. Coconut milk, brown rice flour (that's all I had on hand), unsweetened coconut, salt... I added 1/4 c of coconut sugar, 1/2 c blueberries, and 1 tsp baking soda. Turned out perfect!!! Totally making these again! And super easy to make (I really don't enjoy cooking but my son is GF and I end up making recipes for him which we all love!)

Once again I loved something my family did not. Everyone thought it needed more sugar. I did change some things. I used 3/4 cups rice milk because I did have any coconut milk. I also added 1/2 cup apple sauce and I only used 1 cup coconut flakes. I liked them though and will make them again just for myself.

Ok... I noticed that there was no baking powder or baking soda in this recipe and I was wondering how this was going to work out. These really can't be called "muffins" at all. They have the texture of a macaroon or lemon bar. I added lemon zest and flavoring to mine and while they are tasty, they are NOT muffins. I may make them again and add the baking soda/powder to see what happens.

These where very good. As I had only unsweetened coconut milk I had to add sugar (100g) to it. Did not top with sugar, but they turned out good and sweet enough for my sweet-tooth DH!

My family didn't really like them. When they came out of the oven they are kinda crunchy on the outside, which was nice, but basically tasteless. They aren't really sweet. I sprinkled the tops with sugar which was optional; that made it a lot better. I am a baker at heart and I am just getting into vegan baking. This was actually my first vegan baking recipe. Sorryâ€¦won't be making this again.

Was looking to use up some rice flour and love coconut, so was willing to try this recipe despite the bad reviews. If you love coconut, this recipe is good. I added baking powder, hoping to fluff it up. Also, I used a regular sized muffin tin, so only filled the cups 2/3 of the way.  Next time, I will add sugar to the batter. The muffins did not leven much.  But, they were  not gooey at all. I loved all the coconut flavor. Just needed sugar, for my preference.  As the recipe  reads, its sortof a salty/sweet treat. I can see why all sorts of people did not have positive reviews. It doesn't have that wheat-muffin decadence and sweetness that most people want. I personally like the combo and will make it again, but will add sugar to the batter.

I made this recipe with chocolate chips.  The muffins tasted good. But, were to dense.  I am going to try using a teaspoon of baking powder next time.

Followed the recipe as written, but these did not work. Baked 15 minutes extra and they were still raw in the middle. The batter was very runny so I suspected they wouldn't bake well, and they did not.  Would love to know how the positive reviewers got a better result.

Despite a few other negative reviews, I was hopeful these would turn out okay.  The muffins were very bland - even though I included cinnamon and vanilla to try and increase the flavor.  The muffins ended up sticking badly to the muffin pan and came "out" looking like little dough balls.  I baked them almost twice as long as the recommended time and they still did not cook all the way through.  Overall, very disappointed with this recipe and will not try it again.

Interesting texture...   This recipe makes 18 regular-sized muffins.  Even with 1/2 tsp. baking soda added the muffins didn't rise.  I filled the muffin cups 1/2 full and they were the same size after baking and kind of doughy in the middle.  I added some minced chocolate chips to the batter for a bit more taste.

Very good, perfect as mini muffins.  Great for dairy and wheat-free diets and easy to make vegan.  Would recommend the sprinkling of sugar for a little sweetness.

I love coconut so these were very very disappointing. I even followed the recipe as written. Filled the muffin pan all the way up (as reviews stated) and they still sunk down to be little more than 1/2 their original size. They tasted kind of OK the first day but got chewier as time passed. They were like chewing fruit snacks but with unappealing texture (because of the coconut). MWon't be making these ever again!

My family loves coconut, but I don't make many coconut recipes because coconut and coconut milk have sooooo much saturated fat.  This recipe caught my eye though.  I hadn't used rice flour before.  I was impressed with the result.  It is almost savory.  They stayed moist for the few days they lasted.  The batter filled the minimuffin pan perfectly.

I wish I could say something positive about these muffins.  Coconut is one of the family favourites but these miss the mark.  Not very flavourful.  Texture much too dense and heavy.  Will not make again.

I am not the best of bakers at the best of times so considering these only have a handful of (allergy free) ingredients i thought they were pretty good.

I did alter the ingredients as well based on on some of of the other reviews.  I did half and half sweetened/unsweetened coconut and used only 1/2 cup of white rice flour and the rest in brown (because i ran out of white).   THey do come out with a lovely coconutty taste not too sweet but just enough sweetness to satisfy my sugar craving.   The downside is that they turn out looking like little mini hockey pucks.  I would add an egg and some bakign soda next time to get them to rise.  

definately a recipe i'll try again in an attempt to perfect.

Very easy to make but not very tasty.  I added a bit of vanilla and brown sugar to the mix and put some butter mixed with more brown sugar and cinnomon on top of them and that made them much better.  But an over all blah recipe.

They do taste like coconut and baked well in my silicone muffin tin.  I liked the crispy outside texture, but didn't care for the softer inside.  I also found them bland (like eating unsweetened coconut flakes) with a slight aftertaste from the rice flour.    This morning I cut a muffin into three slices, added butter with a light sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar then toasted it in a toaster oven. I liked it much better that way.  I doubt I'll use this recipe again, but if I do I might try using sweetened coconut flakes and maybe some mini chocolate chips to add a bit of sweetness and hide the rice flour aftertaste.

Not great but haven't tried a gluten free recipe before. Probably won't make again.
