This sauce was wonderful!  I added a jalapeño and it really turned out great.  I browned the flour and onions a little longer than the recipe said to, just until they turned a reddish-brown.  I also didn’t add as much stock as was mentioned in the recipe.  I read the reviews saying it was too runny so I added it a little bit at a time.  This was really a great sauce.  I was looking for something other than the canned sauce and this hit the spot.  It wasn’t too spicy so if you’re looking for spice, add a jalapeno or two.

Thanks!

I tripled the recipe and will be freezing half of it tonight. The nice thing about this recipe is that you can adjust the chilie peppers to your taste and play with new varieties. My family has a long tradition of using chilie peppers. I learned it from my grandmother. Its really not as much work as this recipe says. Clean the outside of your chilie with a paper towel. Open the chilies and take out the stem and seeds. Over a hot, dry skillet (not in the oven), throw in the cleaned chilies. Heat inside and outside until it starts to get soft. You are just doing this to heat up the oils. There should be no smoking and you aren't really looking for a change of color. Once they are done, throw them in a pot of simmering water. Once the chilies are in, turn the pot off and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Save the water! After all that, I throw it in the blender and puree it. Add some of the water if needed to the blender. I like big chunks of garlic in my enchilada sauce, so I just pureed the chilies and left the stock, garlic and butter as is ( I don't use onion because I don't like them). It's much faster this way and still as tasty. Good luck!

Finally, I've found an enchilada sauce recipe that equals the flavor found in my favorite Tucson restaurants.  Easy to make, perfect consistency, and the "heat" can be adjusted according to the chiles use.

This is a pretty easy recipe, a little on the thin side, though. Also, I found that the toasting of the chiles in the oven was a bit time-consuming. Especially when the same effect can be produced by quickly pan searing the chiles. To do this, I usually cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds, then over medium high heat I fry each half about 10-15 seconds per side, while applying pressure with a spatula. Then, just continue the recipe as written.

This sauce was good and probably very authentic but it didn't really thicken up like it was supposed to until it was cooking and even then it didn't get very thick.  In addition, it took a lot longer than anticipated, primarily with the pepper preparations, toasting, soaking, scraping.  Turned out fine just didn't seem worth the effort.

I gave 4 stars because of the pulp prep on this. Like many other reviewers, I just seeded, removed stems, and toasted on comal before soaking.  No problems with color.  For bitterness, add a little sugar till its to your liking.

Nice job! I would add that to skin peppers, after you remove them from oven, place them in a tightly covered plastic container with some water in the bottom. Put directly in fridge. After they cool, the skins will almost fall off of the peppers.

Thank you! I used a blender to make the sauce (without the flour) as the old recipe I couldn't find did and I used Olive oil. No tomatoes! Real Enchilada sauce never had tomatoes! Thank you again.

I made enchiladas for my whole family. Everyone LOVED them, the  sauce is what really did it. They were all so amazed that I made the sauce and didn't simply use the store bought stuff (which I will never buy again). I doubled the number of chilies and added more flour. The hardest part was removing the pulp from the skin. The effort was well worth the end result.

This is SO much better than any red sauce.  I'm not partial to a tomato based sauce, so this hit the spot.  Granted, it isn't meant to be something made in 5 minutes, but it is to be expected when you make something AUTHENTIC.  If you take the time, you will be rewarded!

After reading a lot of the reviews for this recipe, I noticed several comments regarding the skin being hard to remove from the pulp. Here's the secret for that...after roasting the peppers immediately put them in a ziptop bag and close. Let sit/steam in bag for 10 minutes then remove and peel the peppers and continue with the recipe as written.

USE THE WHOLE CHILE! I loved this sauce, but had to rate 4/5 because scraping the pulp out of a dried chile is absurd! Toast (I used a comal on the stovetop instead of the oven), reconstitute, and the just use whole. That's what I learned in cooking school in Mexico, that's how we make mole, pipian rojo, and lots of other authentic Mexican dishes, and it saves a ton of time and flavor. Well-toasted chiles aren't bitter. Great recipe! I recommend extra salt and lime wedges for serving.

This sauce was really good. Rich, deep, smoky flavor. I am not sure you need the flour or maybe just a little bit. I did add a 12 oz can of V-8 juice to cool the heat of the chilies down. I made cheese and onion enchiladas with this sauce and flat on the plate, I  Always top my enchiladas with a fried egg, or 2!  You break the golden yolk over those cheesy, spicy disks of goodness and the egg just gives them  another depth of flavor. Terrific!! Thank You Bill for a yummy sauce and I am not sure I will buy canned sauce again!! This is sooo much better!:)

I am giving this recipe a 5 star rating based solely on taste.  The sauce is wonderful!  Otherwise, it is a pain in the rear to make and very time consuming.  Perhaps with more practice I can be satisfied with the time it takes to make this recipe.  The results are worth it.  I followed the recipe exactly as is except for one thing:  I used a hand blender.  Please save yourself the grief of blending in batches and risking getting burned by using a hand blender.

This sauce was absolutely PERFECT!  The only thing I did differently was only used 2 cups broth instead of 3 and left out the onion because I just don't like onions.  I had a hard time removing the skins so I just gave up and pureed them in with it and it was wonderful anyways.  I loved the flavor it had and was really happy how it turned out.  I was looking for something that more closely matched the authentic taste of my favorite Mexican restaurant and this was exactly what I had in mind, thanks for the recipe!  (Also, mine ended up being a very dark red color, it sounds like there is quite a variety of what color others have turned out!)

This recipe is very authentic. I'm from San Diego and this is the way they make enchilada sauce in many Mexican restaurants. It does take more time but it has a better flavor than the canned sauce I use when I'm in a hurry. You can use different dried chilis to get different tastes and degrees of spiciness. This sauce also works for making chili.

This is almost like my mother's recipe. We use three types of dried chiles.  (California, Pasilla, and Ancho) Instead of scraping the chiles out we blend the chiles with a little water from the boiling proces. Strain the chili mixture and you end up with a base sauce.  I freeze the base sauce in containers until I am ready to use it.  I heat up the sauce and add  add chicken buillon powder (Knorr brand)  Sometimes I want a little spicier sauce and add chili powder.

We were curious about making our own enchilada sauce so we gave this a try. The chilies, like several reviewers said, were a royal pain even though I tried to 'steam' off the skins we still had to scrape the pulp. I also went to 3 different markets looking for the chilies- we're in an urban area with ethnic groceries and large "international" sections and good cross-section of produce in the regular markets but sadly no Latin grocery near us. I wound up getting New Mexico peppers instead of ancho/pasillas. Hubby bought a jar of sauce in case the recipe didn't work out; we followed the recipe, it smelled good and tasted OK but was lacking something. Added about 1/4 cup of the jar stuff and it immediately came together. We went on to make delicious enchiladas with my homemade refried beans. Will definitely try this again when we find the right peppers.

This recipe is the BEST!  Family will literally drive from hours away when I make this enchilada sauce.  I discovered it over 5 years ago and have never made or used another red sauce.  It is a bit time consuming but SO worth every minute.  Only complaint is that it goes so quickly once everyone starts eating!  I make nearly exactly how the recipes instructs, maybe not using as much fluid, depending on the batch, and it comes out perfectly.  I notice others discussing the consistency but I haven't had any trouble with that.

I never want sauce from a can/jar ever again after having this sauce. I used 3 poblano and 3 Anaheim peppers. It had a nice smokey flavor and a beautiful green sauce. Definitely making again:)

I used this sauce to make beef enchiladas with Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat, Kraft Mexican cheese blend and flour tortillas...it was delicious! My daughter's eyes got big and she said they tasted like the local Mexican restaurant. This sauce was so fresh and it definitely made the dish great. This recipe made more than needed for a 9x13 Pyrex so I will increase it by about a quarter next time and make two 9x13 dishes and freeze half. I could not find Ancho or Pasilla peppers at the grocery store so I decided on using Pablano and Jalapeno after studying the pepper use and hotness chart the store provided. It turned out to be more of a white or green sauce rather than red like the picture here on the website.  I will definitely make this sauce again.

This sauce was delicious! I only made a few minor changes, based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used about 10 Guajillo chilis and 5 of the smaller, hotter arbol for a rather pleasant afterburn. I also used Knorr tomato bouillon w/chicken flavor instead of the plain chicken broth. I used the sauce with shredded pheasant to make enchiladas and it was a spicy hit. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This recipe was great.  Could use a little more information on how much water to put with the peppers.  If you try this recipe the flour amount will vary in order to get the proper thickness of the sauce.

I used green chilies instead of ancho and pasilla peppers. The taste is outstanding!

good sauce, but all that pepper prep work seemed useless. i just roast them over a flame, or even on skillet, pan, whatever, for a few seconds. removed only the stem, and they were good to go.

this is THE BEST enchilada sauce!  i was worried when i saw that the sauce was white (im used to seeing red or brown) but it is the best sauce ive ever had in either a restaurant or at home.  i dont worry about which kinds of chili peppers i buy.  i always just get whats available at my store.   WONDERFUL!

Excellent!!! Loved it. I noticed that if I roast the chilis in a pan then soaked then in the water it actually made them easier to remove the pulp. I used ancho chilis and New Mexico chilis. Great taste.

So easy, so delicious, what else could you ask for?  The color was scary but that is not what its all about!  I only used Fresno Chili peppers (its all I had) but it still tasted fantastic.

Boiling the Chile peppers as oppose to just letting them soak is what I usually do.  After boiling, I just pop the whole thing (minus seeds & stem) in blender.  I strain in a colinder afterwards.  It is time consuming but it does keep it thick.  I add garlic powder, onion and salt.  While boiling the smell ifmakes you cough, you got yourself some HOT sauce!

Very nice sauce! I didn't have fresh chillies so I used half a teaspoon of dried chilli flakes and seeds and half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I also added a teaspoon of paprika. I used the sauce with some beans, roasted and chopped red peppers, and minced beef, for enchiladas!

This sauce did not turn out well at all - it tasted more like chicken broth than enchilada sauce.
