Made these this morning and they turned out well.  My husband said they tasted like peanut butter cookies. Used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.  Will also add more jelly at the end next time.  I like my muffins a little sweeter.

We love these! I use about 3/4 cup of peanut butter and add half a bag of chocolate chips. They make good muffins - not too sweet for us - and I don't even bother with the jelly/chopped peanut topping.
