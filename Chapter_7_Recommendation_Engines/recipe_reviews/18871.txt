The recipe's fine as is.  I don't understand the need on the part of some to completely re-write the recipe. If you do that, you've created a NEW recipe, so why bother rating this one, as is?   (Am I gonna be banned/kicked off the recipe.com site now for pointing out rudeness?)  Just curious. :)    

This is a new take on the tuna casserole recipe.  You either like it or you don't.  I think it's fine, as written.  Thank you to the creator for posting their creation.

Great recipe but I'm completely in agreement with the review and comments by, "ChgoFoodieGal".  And in that spirit I made some changes to the recipe.  For the macaroni I substituted flour, baking soda and baking powder.  For the tuna I substituted eggs.  For the onions I substituted oil.  For the cheese I substituted buttermilk.  I ended up with a batter that I cooked on a hot griddle and ended up with pancakes.  But it was a great tuna casserole recipe! ;~}  

Honestly, making a minor change to a recipe you're reviewing is one thing but most of these reviews have changed so many ingredients that I don't see why they bother to review it.  It kind of misses the point of posting recipes with specific ingredients, doesn't it?  This recipe is either good as it is, (or with a minor modification) or it isn't.

This recipe was excellent as it was written.  I 100% agree with ChgoFoodieGal when she said it's ridiculous to thoroughly CHANGE the recipe and then rate it.  We are rating THIS recipe.  I can maybe see adding more spice or possibly one item, but some raters change almost all the ingredients except the main one, losing the entire concept of the rating system.  Good grief.

This is a simple recipe! It easily adapts. I didn't have FF Onion, and was out of cheddar.  Instead, I used 2 slices provolone & 2 slices of american cheese on top.  At the end of baking, I added pan toasted/buttered homemade crouton & pan toasted sliced almonds. I very much agree w/ the suggested extra can of tuna & more moisture (1/2-3/4 C. Milk or water). I prefer Cream of Mushroom.  I add a dash of this and that of my favorite spices.  It wasn't too creamy or too rich. My husband had cringed at the notion of Tuna Casserole at dinner. Once he tried it, he asked for seconds and THIRDS -- plus he's even requested it a few weeks later...Now, thats what I like-- a simple, basic recipe that is a family favorite!  My toddler also loved it.  Next time, I'll add some peas to complete this one dish meal.

My husband and I agree that this is the best tuna casserole we've ever had! Thanks, Lindsay's roommate! 

However, other reviewers were right on when they suggested a few additions - like 1/2 to 3/4 cup milk, another can of tuna, and Velveeta cheese. 

Also, if you are like me and are unsure how much macaroni to cook to get 3 cups cooked, I finally found a conversion for pasta on a cook's chart. According to that chart, 1 cup uncooked pasta will yield 2+ cups cooked. So, I am going to try 1 1/2 cups uncooked next time instead of just eyeballing it...despite the great fun that can be!

SOOO GOOD! I used 4 C of cooked macaroni, 2 cans of tuna, one can cream of chicken soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 C of milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, blackpepper powder, 2 TBSP mayonnaise, and 1 tsp of dijon mustard. I put some cheddar cheese with the pasta mixture and put on top a combination of cheddar cheese and Italian mix cheese. On top of that, I melted 4 TBSP of butter, combined with 8 TBSP of seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled on top of the cheese. This is totally Da Bomb!

From the start, I heeded the advice of other reviewers: added one can of mushroom soup, an extra can of tuna, half a can of milk, and a can of peas.  I tasted the mixture at that point, and it was pretty good.  For extra flavor, I added lemon pepper, garlic powder, dry mustard, and basil.  I was generous with everything but the mustard.  I used lowfat soups and omitted the cheese to save a few fatgrams, and it was still delicious, and easy, too!

Very good base recipe. I summarized others' advice for my liking so the renovated ingredients were:  2 cans of tuna, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom, garlic salt, frozen peas, about 1/2c mayo, black pepper, diced onions, a touch of whole milk, about 4 cups cooked macaroni, 1 c shredded cheese, and 1 c french friend onions. It was very good and i couldn't stop eating it for days (tasted good the next day too). Even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I couldn't stop thinking it needed something else. The diced onions and french friend onions added a little crunch, but more was needed. My mom used to make a tuna casserole using leftover potato chips. I think that would be perfect to try in this next time - crush up the potato chips and mix in with the casserole. It adds a lightly crunchy potato. I'll also add a dash of tabasco sauce next time for a kick as was also suggested. I'm keeping this recipe - in the form I changed it to. :-) 3 stars because it's a base recipe but definitely needs kicks to it. Thanks, Andrea, for the start to many interesting creations from this!

This was extremely wonderful - my new comfort food! I made a few of the alterations other people suggested: 2 cans of tuna, frozen peas, one can cr. of chicken, one can cr. of mushroom, plus some garlic salt. I tasted it at that point, and found I was wanting a little bit of zing in it. So I added about 2/3 cup of mayo, and it turned out marvelous. I would recommend trying that for a bit of zip. I also omitted the onions since I didn't have any. But all said, this recipe is a great starting point, and probably would have been awesome if left alone too. I am pregnant, and think it's become one of my new cravings... (new addition: I love pickles with my tuna sandwiches, so I thought, why not? I threw in some dried dill weed, and it tastes marvelous!)

I so agree with CHGOFOODIEGAL, don't show a review with totallly changing the recipe.
ALL recipes, and I mean ALL recipes are individual creations.  whenever you adapt/change/alter, which is what ALL good cooks do for personal preferences, you have then made a unique/personal recipe, which you should take the time to adapt, measure, and do all the things necessary to make it your own version, and publish it.  Not totally embelish and change someones creation or adaptation of a recipe THEY made for personal taste.
TRY the recipe as printed, rate it, then make your own adjustments for taste later, and create your own recipe..
Nick Stellino, a personal mentor, and expert southern mediterranean chef, in his book, "CUCINA AMORE", that taught me the basics of cooking and adapting, says the same thing.  Try it the way it is written,  then, as all recipes are, adapt to make it your own, through experiment and creativeness, and personal taste..

Kimberly,  this was an excellent version of an old family standby in comfort foods.  Thank you....And I am sure I will adjust it somewhat for personal preference, AFTER, I try it your way...hehe.  Thanks girl.  very good as is.  5 stars for your creative juices.  keep'em coming..

like everyone else, i added to this recipe, but found it to be an excellent one.  i doubled it to feed 5 adults and added 2 cups frozen peas and used 3 cans total of albacore tuna.  also added some black pepper and tabasco sauce for some kick and there were no left overs!!  darn it!  can't believe how easy it was to make too, definately will make again!

I agree with previous reviewers. This recipe is good in its original form and the addition of the fried onion rings is very good. You other reviewers have created entirely new recipes when you make as many changes as some of you have made. Why not submit your version as a new recipe? Sorry to be critical but people are looking for a review of THIS recipe and not one that you have created from this one. PLEASE!!!

I love tuna, in any way, shape or form. I liked the fried onion addition and so did my kids. I did add fresh minced onion, green pepper and some seasonings to the mixture, including cayenne, being that my girls were born with asbestos mouths. With my older daughter taking three dance classes and the youngest ten classes, an easy and quick recipe is something I'm always looking for. Loved it Lindsay and thanks!

This recipe is delicious.  I wholeheartedly Disagree with ChgoFoodieGal  and Hobbesmom's comments.  I love to read modifications to recipes as I am a beginning cook and like to get creative and interesting ideas on how I can change recipes and make them even better.  Thats what this website is about .....right?  My substitutes were I used 1 cup of milk, 2 cans of tuna , a can of cream of chicken soup, a pinch of onion and garlic powder, a pinch of pepper,  and after it was all stirred together I put about two cups of cheddar cheese on top I sprinkled some Italian breadcrumbs over it.  I also used a smaller pyrex dish not a 9x13 one as the noodles seem to spread to thin over the glass and did not cover the bottom completly.  It came out a 10 !! Wonderful recipe.  My husband and I ate the whole thing ....no leftovers!!  Next  time I may add a little more cheddar cheese and forget the italian breadcrumbs.  Dont get too carried away with seasoning, mine turned out perfect but it could have been easy to go overboard with the garlic and onion powders.

This was really good. I added a bit of salt.

I was reading the reviews, and it seems some people didn't cook the macaroni beforehand, or measured out dry pasta, then cooked and added it. The recipe specifically says "3 cups cooked macaroni".  It's kind of hard to rate and comment on something if you didn't follow the recipe correctly. ;)

The handiest tips I gathered from pouring through the reviews -- 2 cups uncooked macaroni = 3 cups cooked as called for; and, 1/2 soup can of milk made a great consistency.  Excellent -- comfort dining at its finest!

Had a full day of yard work planned yesterday, so I wanted something easy for dinner.  I know this recipe has had great reviews, but it was just a disappointment.  I made this dish exactly as written, and there's not enough filling for a 9x13 dish; I used an 8x8 and it wasn't spilling over the top of the dish.  It must just be a taste preference, but we didn't care for it.  My apologies to the recipe writer for the bad review (I rarely give one), but this just didn't work for us.

So, I did change the recipe, but I think this would be great even without the changes.  I added an extra can of tuna, a can of cream of mushroom soup because my husband likes mushrooms, a sprinkling of lemon pepper, salt, pepper and onion powder and lastly- 1/4 C of sour cream.  Basically, I added the tuna/cream of mushroom for taste/creaminess, the spices to balance out the extra tuna and the sour cream because it was in my fridge and would have gone bad otherwise.  This is a great base recipe that I bet tastes good on its own, but tastes absolutely awesome with my additions.  Creamy, but not overwhelmingly fishy.  Reminds me a little of Tuna Helper, but is not nearly as salty and a heck of a lot creamier/sturdier.  Feel free to mess around with this recipe, I don't think you can mess it up.

My Grandma has been making a similar version of this recipie for years. She always makes it with egg noodles instead of macaroni. It's one of my favorites. You can also try adding peas mushrooms or celery. I love cheese so I always add a little to the soup/tuna mixture before I add the noodles. Also great with a little parmesan on the top.

Okay, this gets a five stars but I took liberties with the ingredients.  Here's what I changed:  2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni, 12 oz. canned chicken;drained, 1-10.75 oz. crm of mushroom soup, 1-10.75 oz. crm of chicken soup, 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar and 1/2 can of milk.  I tossed in some frozen peas as well and just covered the entire dish with the french fried onions after it had baked for 25 minutes.  All the cooking directions remained the same.  I love this!...and so did my kids.  My youngest son even went back for thirds.  Wow.  Thank you Lindsay.

This is a great easy weeknight recipe! I double the tuna (because in my house we LOVE tuna) and I use half a can of cream of chicken soup and half a can of cream of celery, just to add more layers to the flavor. Definitely a favorite comfort food for a busy week!

We really like this recipe. Although we did make alterations. In an oven safe pan, we cook sliced mushrooms, diced sweet onion, frozen peas and minced garlic. Add soup and tuna. If it seems too thick, add milk. Add cooked whole wheat noodles. Mix in cheese and bake. Omit fried onions.

So simple. So yummy. I was looking for a replacement for our mac n cheese (boxed), tuna fish and peas meal. This was perfect! Great recipe. 
I just added peas. I used bread crumbs because that's all I had and that worked just fine too.

One of the simplest and easiest recipes that taste great. Anyone can add a sprinkle of salt, pepper or cayenne to suit their taste.

Really like this one- so easy.  I used whole wheat macaroni, threw in some frozen peas,  added a little garlic powder and mixed some of the fried onions into the soup/tuna mix.  I probably used less cheese than called for as well.  Might just throw this one into the rotation because I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Great base recipe! I kicked it up a notch by doubling the tuna and sauteeing chopped onion and red pepper in olive oil and adding to the mix. It adds moisture, color, and flavor. I also used parmesian cheese and crushed red pepper flakes and it spiced it up. I have also included jalapenos in the sautee and it's even better!

I don't like tuna casserole (my husband does) and I'd never made one before. I followed the recipe but added 1/3 cup of milk, a pinch of curry, a few sprinkles of pepper and salted it to taste. I only had one can of tuna (6oz). If I'd had two, it would have been perfect. This casserole was creamy, flavorful, easy, fast and ALL gone! Even I had seconds. I can't think of anything wrong with it!

This was awesome! I love tuna and this was a great way to add some variety to my usual fall back recipes. I had real onion on hand so chopped it finely and mixed right in, also followed other recommendation and used one can of chicken and mushroom soups. Also topped the dish with an additional cup of cheese. I felt it needed a little extra flavor, so I added garlic and paprika, celery salt and white pepper. This will be a new family favorite for sure!

I can't believe I am giving a tuna casserole recipe 5 stars....but, this deserves it!  I did follow some suggestions and make a few changes: I used cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chicken), added 1/2 cup milk, added an additional can of tuna, added some panko bread crumbs, and seasoned it up a bit to my liking.  Turned out great!  Husband couldn't get enough.  Thank you!

I made this dish for the first time, and it turned out great! Added a can of cream of mushroom soup (as well as cream of chicken), some frozen peas, and celery, and some milk as other reviewers mentioned it being dry without. Used two cans of tuna, as we like it so much. Put it in smaller pan, 8" I think which was just right. Plus fried my own onions and used Provolone cheese...I know, I know, the changes, "change" the original recipe, but I found it a great basic recipe...and of course you want it to turn out great, so I listened to reviews, but don't blame me for that! lol! That's why only the 4 stars. I used what I had as I was staying at a cabin far away from supermarkets!

If you are looking to replace boxed Tuna helper, this is a great recipe. Super easy and very good, plus it is versatile. I added garlic, half & half, and broccoli because they were lying on hand and needed to be used and it was perfect.

This recipe needs a lot of love like others have stated.  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, paprika, salt, and pepper.  Just a few things to jazz it up a bit.  I also added a layer of chopped spinach.

On its own, the recipe is pretty boring. Like many others, I had to dress it up and change it a bit: I added another can of tuna, 3/4 milk, some onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper, a cup of peas, and a cup of minced white onion. With that, it's a 5-star recipe! :)

I thought this was delicious! I did add 3/4 cup of milk as suggested. I didnt have cream of chicken soup so I used what I did have, cream of mushroom. I only had about a cup of french fried onions, so I also added bread crumbs. I enjoyed this, it was really easy to make, and tasted even better the next day for lunch.

ok, I am going to rate this recipe as it is written and then give you the 5 star alterations.  For a 5 star rating...saute 1/2 onion and a couple cloves of garlic in some olive oil or butter.  Add this to the noodles (I used egg noodles), cream of chicken AND cream of mushroom, 1 cup milk, salt, pepper, 1-2 cups grated cheese.  Then top with extra cheddar cheese.  I think the topper is optional and can be done with potato chips or bread crumbs or crushed crackers or the french onion the recipe calls for.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used it as a base and made a few changes (added more tuna, milk, mayo, baby bellas, Morton's  natures seasons, celery salt and minced garlic) and I mixed some of the cheese in the casserole before baking.  Excellent comfort food, and even the kids enjoyed it.

We did not enjoy this casserole.  We found it very salty with the FF onions and very dry (not creamy).  The not 'creamy' part might have been our fault though as we used lower fat options for the soup and cheese.  

It would also be helpful if the recipe indicated the quantity of dry macaroni to use to get 3 cups cooked and whether the tuna was flaked or chunk tuna.

This was ok.  I thought it was very basic. I did use 2 cans of tuna and I added a little milk to the soup mix so it would be more runny.  I also added 1 can of mixed veggies to boost the health factor.

This is an alright recipe. My family enjoyed it, although I found it to be a bit bland.  I did add some frozen peas and carrots to the dish before sticking it in the oven.  I will probably not make it again, unless my husband asks me to,

This was amazing. I was so worried it was going to be dry but it wasn't--totally delicious. I used penne pasta and added frozen peas the last couple minutes of cooking, also used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. It was really really good, we will be making it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made as is, this recipe is a little more dry than I normally prefer for a tuna casserole.  However, the flavor is excellent, and I would make it again.  I would most likely experiment with adding more liquid or condensed soup to make it a little creamier.

I am not a tuna casserole fan. This was really good! I think it was because of the cheddar cheese and the french fried onions. YUM!! Will make again. I added about half cup of the french fried onions and a can of mixed veggies into the tuna mixture.

Added about 10 turns of fresh cracked pepper. About 2 cups of dry pasta yielded 3 cups of cooked pasta.  My casserole barely filled a 8x8' square pan. Very tasty and easy but dry. I think adding milk would make it a better consistancy.

I loved this and just made a few adjustments, used 2 cans of tuna, added 2 cut green onions and used two cans of soup, and added peas.

I was so good. I will make it again.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times - as written and with changes. As written, it's a great comfort food and I almost always have everything on hand to just toss it together quickly. I made it earlier this week with the following changes: I added a garlic clove, used cream of mushroom soup, sauteed some onion, celery and  mushrooms and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. I was using what I had on hand and trying to use up the last bits of produce that I didn't want to throw away. It doesn't seem to matter what I do, this recipe always turns out great.

This was not a hit for us. I followed the instructions and it just came out dry and bland. I thought there was not enough tuna and spices and too much noodle. I like my tuna casserole to be creamy, lots of tuna so I can actually taste the tuna flavor, and a few more spices. If you really look at the majority of reviews on here, a lot of them state they used this as the 'base' of the recipe but added a lot more to it...to me, it's not fair to give a recipe a good review if you do that because you aren't really using the actual recipe...you're making your own. I don't think I will be making this again unless of course I add a lot more to it...but then I wouldn't really be using this specific recipe then would I?

As a basic tuna casserole recipe, this one is perfect. But I like to add 1 small onion, grated with a cheese grater because there's nothing worse than getting a bite of undercooked, raw onion in my opinion; this way, grated, it cooks fully and you get a nice hint of onion flavor throughout. Like others, I also doubled the amount of tuna to 2 cans. I added approx. 1/2 cup of milk for creaminess. And I find that macaroni, even cooked to al dente, has a tendency to overcook in the oven and get mushy, so I use rotini/fusilli (corkscrew pasta) which tends to hold its shape and texture more. Instead of adding fried onions on top, I like to sprinkle some crushed potato chips or crushed Ritz crackers. Surprisingly, I found that crushed sour cream & onion chips on top is a delicious variation -- adds a nice zip and savory onion taste.

This was delicious and easy. I took the advice from other reviews and added a can of peas, second can of tuna, half a soup can of milk (I used lowfat milk), garlic and onion powder to taste. I'll make this one again for sure! Thanks!

I double most of my recipes (check my other reviews if you're a doubler).  I also try them 3 times before I review them.  I tripled the tuna, used 3 cups of UNCOOKED noodles, 2 cans of cream of whatever, and 2 cans of milk or a little more.  I used approximately 2 cups of cheese and 2 or so cups of French-fried onions (to your taste) The spices really made the difference, because the first time I didn't use enough and it tasted bland.  I used Old bay seasoning about one Tablespoon.  Just add to taste and error on the side of more.  Cayenne, garlic powder and paprika tasted pretty good one time.

This did not last that long from the moment I opened the oven door to the when the last morsel was eaten.  Very tasty and easy!  I took the recipe and modified it as some of the other reviewers had by adding extra cheese, extra tuna, watching the noodle amount, adding peas and adding a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Yummy, yummy!  But what really made this meal even better...the French fried onions... Who knew that something so small could make such a difference...  MORE FRENCH FRIED ONIONS, PLEASE!  That was the phrase of the night!

I doctored up the recipe as suggested by others, but this recipe was just so-so.  My husband told me to NEVER make this again, he hated it.  My kids actually liked it pretty wel,l so it may become something I make for Saturday afternoon lunches.

Delicious. I made a few changes though. I measured 1 and a 1/2 cups of dry macaroni before cooking it. Then I put cooked macaroni in a 2 quart casserole dish and added 1 can tuna, 1 can of low fat cream of chicken soup, salt and pepper. Then followed the rest of the directions. It was perfect! The two of us had the entire thing finished in minutes. I really liked the french fried onions on the top as well. It really gave it a nice flavor.

This was delicious, but not as creamy as we would have liked.  Next time, I'll add a 2nd can of cream of chicken or cream of celery and a little more cheese on top.  The fried onions really gave it a flavor kick!

I didn't use french fried onions (because I don't know what that is!) but this was yummy and I used
Chicken soup with vegetables to give it some vege content.   I had to cook it longer than suggested
and finished it off under the griller to brown the cheese a little.  We enjoyed it!

I made the mistake of using 3 cups uncooked pasta, but that was my fault. It turned out dry b/c of my mistake. I will definitely try it again and do it correctly. It was good otherwise! Thanks!

The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was very good but needed more tuna as tuna cans now contain only 4oz drained weight where it used to be 6oz drained weight.  The second time I tweaked it with a second can of tuna and used cream of mushroom soup. I also used half the amount of pasta and added half of a large head of cooked and finely chopped cauliflower to cut down on the carb grams and a cup of frozen peas because I like peas in a tuna casserole. It was delicious both ways and NO ONE noticed that there was cauliflower in it!! I also agree with Chicagogirl about reviewing with tweaks instead of the original recipe.

Is good as written. I prefer other additions to mine, however, I will not post what I do. I do want to address some reviewers who find it necessary to chastise other reviewers for changing the recipe and posting their changes in the review, saying submit your own recipe for publication. AllRecipes.com receives thousands of recipe submissions every day and the chances of your recipe(s) getting published is pretty slim. I have one published recipe on this site, but I have submitted many more that were not. Cooks love to tell others how they make something their way. It's to brag a little, sure, but we mainly really like to help other cooks with our experience and ideas. So to those who find this rude or disrespectful to the recipe creator, just don't read those type of reviews and move on. No need to try to shame other reviewers. Personally, I like to see what other cooks do to a recipe and may use their ideas when I make it too. My own recipe published on this site has received an overall 4.5 star rating and plenty of people changed it to their liking. Most cooks don't mind this. I do mind if people don't follow directions then rate the recipe low and complain the recipe isn't good or didn't work out. But omitting/adding ingredients is fine.

This was a hit at my house, I had to change some things only because I didn't have what the recipe called for and really all I did was use a larger can of Cream of Chicken soup, and used More cans of Tuna ;) and used sliced american cheese broke over the top because I had no shredded cheese. I used  4 cans of Tuna but that is Our personal preference we like ours to have a lot of "meat" and my can of cream of chicken soup was the big family size :) No peas added (one I didn't have any and two I don't like them any way lol) My kids Couldn't get enough of it they had 2 servings and wanted a third AND wanted more the following day for lunch ;) They ate theirs with buttered bread and was happy campers! even my boyfriend who is not a fan of pasta had no complaints. 

This Recipe was perfect as is! I wouldn't of added/changed anything - like I said I only used Larger quantities of what was called for and a different type of cheese only because I didn't have any shredded types of cheese.

I have to say I did alter the recipe a little.  I add an extra can of tuna, 2 cups of frozen peas and 1 can of milk.  None of this is nessasary, just my preference.   That being said, this by far is the best tuna casserole ever.

Not nearly enough soup mixture. Next time I will go one and a half cans. Good base but needs work.

I give this recipe three stars as it is, but I do think it's a good starting point and has a lot of potential.  I love that it requires only a handful of ingredients and it's quick!  But I found it to be a bit too dry for my taste.  I will probably double the soup and/or add some milk, as well as some veggies for extra flavor.  I modified (for lower fat) by omitting the fried onions and instead topping it with some minced onions and panko bread crumbs.

The flavor was good. I added chopped celery. I also added at least a cup of water/milk as midway through cooking it looked like it was drying out. Turned out really good with that added.

Absolutely love this recipe! I add a half cup of sour cream to add to the creaminess and a half cup of frozen peas to get some veggies in there. Great weeknight meal made mostly with pantry staples. ENJOY!!!

yummo!  go ahead and complain because i altered it, but isn't that the point of cooking - customization to your taste and ingredients!! :)  so i mistakenly made too much pasta and it looked dry.  so i added a 6 oz cup of polain greek yogurt, because i didn't have any more soup.  i chose to mix the cheese in, but only used about a half cup.  i nixed the french fried onions and just sprinkled a little bit of breadcrumbs on top.  very simple but very good.  i think the yogurt made it super creamy, too.  thanks!

Thank goodness for reviews. I am not a great cook and I religiously read reviews, especially for alternative ingredients if I don't have all that are listed. Food is an art and all artists face critiques and good ones use or discard them to become better artists.  In that spirit, more moisture was definitely necessary. I added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup of water. I found that, for my oven, I also had to cover the pan with foil. I used two cans of tuna and added peas. I gave it three stars for this reason, but otherwise it is pretty good.

Tasty! Used 2 cans of tuna, 1 can soup can of milk and added some American cheese. My family loved it! A classic meal much improved since I was a kid. My husband and I added some heat with some Sriracha! A keeper for sure.

I found this recipe helpful. I made one change to suit what I had at the time. I used cooked chicken breast and chopped it up and added some frozen mix vegi. Came out nice. I like to find more ways to use those french fried onions other than in my green bean casserole.

I was going to give this recipe a lot lower rating, but because my family scarfed up almost all that I made and raved about how good it was. Well, I really couldn't complain to much. And left what I thought alone and not voice it to them. Easy at making, baking and topping. I did however triple the batch with the exception of the cheese and French Fried Onions. It was a rather thick but all went into a 9x13 easily. Topped probably with 1 & 1/2-2 cups of cheese and 1 1/2 cup of the onions. Had I not made extra, the batch might have not been enough to feed 5 hungry kids and my husband. I totally think the serving on the recipe is not scaled right. Because 3 cups of cooked noodles does not feed 6-7 people. Having said that. My family liked it, but myself...not so much. I didn't like the cream of chicken with the tuna. And that was just me. I found the taste prior to the baking a bit of a put off. While the family was pleased, that's all that matters.

I was looking to find a tuna casserole recipe because I've never had it before and this was the perfect one!!  I kind of doubled the recipe - I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom (for some reason I thought mushroom was what the recipe called for) and 3 cans of tuna with a 16oz box of tri-colored rotini and used crushed croutons instead of the onions.  I also added some pepper and garlic/onion/chili powder  into the pasta mix and added some cheese and parmesan, b/c my family loves extra cheese. I know it sounds like a totally different recipe, but I would have never come up with that myself if it weren't for this recipe and it's reviews!!  So, awesome base recipe!!

Wow, this is *really* good (I think I just ate half the casserole by myself). I added an extra can of tuna, and peas and mushrooms to make it slightly healthier, but stuck to the recipe other than that. Excellent! This is my new favorite tuna casserole recipe.

The French fried onions are what really made this dish, even my hubby who hates tuna casserole said he wouldn't mind if we had this again :)  The only changes I made were I that I played with the soup a little.  I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of broccoli and one can of cream of chicken.  I added some fresh ground pepper to the mix as well as a little milk for creaminess.  Other than that I left it as is and it turned out great!  My one year old kept shoveling it in :)

This is the best Tuna Casserole my family has ever had!  I did add peas to get some veggies in the meal, but other than that, made as written.  I think it is the french fried onions that really make it.   It will definitely be in my meal rotation in the future!  Even my daughter who hates Tuna said it  wasn't bad.

Yummy! I used whole wheat pasta and solid white albacore, with an extra can of tuna.... I also added 1/2 can of peas. Quick and easy!

As good as tuna casserole gets. I was bored with the traditional recipes involving mushroom soup & saltines plus I had some leftover crispy onions to use and this worked out well. My picky hubby liked it better than the other recipes. The onions give it a unique yet good taste. I also feel that cheese makes everything better!

When my husband saw what I was making for dinner, he turned up his nose cause he's not a big tuna or french fried onion fan. But when it came time to eat, he went back for seconds and commented on how good this recipe was. He also took it to work for lunch the next day. I did double the tuna and added peas. Great recipe!!! My whole family loved it!!! Easy and very tasty.

I loved this recipe. I did add about 3/4 cup of milk and a cup of frozen peas to the mix. When I put the mix in the casserole dish I did a layer of the mix and then dotted some cheez whiz in the next layer. I repeated the layers until the mixture was gone. The result was a bubbly, cheesy casserole!

Well, it certainly was easy.  Too bad my kids didn't like it. My husband tolerated it.  I liked how easy it was but I don't think I'll make it again.

Excellent recipe for tuna, even my husband (who doesn't normally care for tuna casseroles) loved this cheesy, crunchy dish.  Very easy to make as well, forget the tuna helper!

This is a great, easy recipe.  I have been making tuna casserole forever, but never thought to use the French fried onions on top instead of bread crumbs or potato chips.  Really adds pizzazz to the flavors.

My husband and I both love this dish. Very quick and easy to make. I used Albacore tuna and the tuna does not overpower all the other flavors. I also used medium penne pasta. Good for company when you don't have much time.

well lots of folks seem annoyed that people are rating the recipe and making changes...it's looks like a classic "Dorm Room" recipe and could use some tweaking...but before you make a fuss about people changing the recipe...I noticed the picture doesn't even match this recipe...clearly the cook added peas to the recipe pictured but the recipe doesn't call for them...so lighten up and check out the adds and subtraction. If you like it as is...well that's fine too.

Now that's Comfort Food! I added a additional can of tiny shrimp, just a dash of mustard powder, crushed red pepper flakes and a little Old Bay seasoning. Turned out great. I will never use Tuna Helper again. Just for fun I topped with the addition of Chedder GoldFish Crackers.

The French fried onions really make this recipe!  My reason for a four star review instead of five, since I did think this was a quite tasty tuna casserole, is because I thought it was a little dry.  I will probably add another can of cream soup next time.  I also added peas to the recipe.  I ate left overs of this 2 days later and it was even more dry and the french fried onions were soggy.  It wasn't really a good "left-overs" meal.

Only thing added was hot sauce, garlic powder and chili flakes. Didn't have any fried onions and still good.

Fantastic base recipe!!  I've been looking for a "remember when" tuna noodle casserole recipe and THIS is it.  Made it tonight with some personal tweaks and will definitely add this recipe to the rotation.  The fried onions are the key.  Thank you!

Yum, the whole family loved it and it was super easy.  Didn't have any French fried onions, but didn't miss it.  I added about 1/2 cup milk as others mentioned along with a few pinches of salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne.  Great recipe!

I am not a tuna casserole fan at all. I made this recipe for my man, who is a die hard tuna casserole lover, and he... loved it. I have now made it several times for him with rave reviews each time.

One of my favs!  I used to make this in college only used a box of mac & cheese for simplicity!  Easy if you're in a hurry but is much better made from scratch, but I like velveeta.

Was very good. I used a 12 oz. can of tuna and two cans of cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. Also added peas and a little extra cheese. Would have been good without the peas too.

I've made this twice now and I'm giving it 5 stars for being so simple and still tasting amazing. I used cr. of mushroom soup and onions carmelized on the stove. I am now going to go make it again.

For a quick easy tuna casserole, this was pretty good!  All it needs is a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper.

Made this last night for me and the kids. It was comforting and delicious--took me back to my childhood. I didn't have cream of chicken soup or French Fried onions, so I used cream of mushroom soup and topped it with tempura flakes. We also add the frozen peas to ours. My kids gobbled it up!

I made this for a family potluck more as a joke because I'm not a big tuna lover but wow! I was bragging it up and calling it gourmet tuna casserole once I tried it.  I added peas to sneak in a little veggies.

Yummmmm this is good! I did use cream of mushroom soup, but that's just my preference. I also added a bit of garlic salt and onion powder to give it a bit of zip. Topped with parmesan cheese. Very good.

Update **I am changing my rating to 5 stars because I have made this many times and it always gets rave reviews. I mix it up, sometimes I add cayenne pepper, or garlic, or onion, or whatever. It's an excellent base recipe to build on, or perfectly fine as printed. Love it!!

Pretty good idea-french fried onions are great paired with tuna!  we felt it needed more tuna so i rated it 4 starts.  I also added extra "seasoning" some paprika and garlic salt to be exact.  It also helps to add something "creamy" like milk or cream-this is now a staple in our home

As I was making this I had to use a few modifications. 1 when I put the noodles in the 9x13 casserole they barley covered the bottom and I was afraid it would dry out in the oven so I transfered it to a smaller casserole dish so there were several layers of noodles. 2 I added a little milk after the soup because it was sooo thick and again I was afraid of it getting dry and I wanted it creamy. 3 I used two cans of tuna with just one there was barely any there. 4 I added peas to make it a one dish meal and we have to sneak those veggies in for the kids where we can.

This is a good recipe and what makes it better is using cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken and 1 cup of cheese.  The use of cheddar cheese soup gives a lower fat and calorie without loosing the flavor.   Also,  I like the use of crushed saltine crackers and not the fried onions which would also lower the fat.  I would also use a larger can of tuna and then all comes out delicious!

Super good. I make this all the time now. I always add an extra can of tuna, extra can of soup, chopped onions, dollop of mayo and (most importantly, I think) a packet of dry onion soup mix. My boyfriend and everyone else who has tried it has had rave reviews.

Great recipe -- just as written!  The french onions add a great flavor that I hadn't thought about.  

I totally agree with ChgoFoodieGal and others about people "adding this, changing that, and then writing a review" -- it's a totally different recipe.  When I read the reviews of a recipe, I want to know what people think about it, just as it's presented in its original form -- i.e. do you like it or don't you (and if you don't, what don't you like (such as too dry, too bland, whatever)).  If you changed the ingredients, then please just add your own separate recipe to the site and in your review of the original one, tell us what you call your new recipe so that we can go to that one and see if we want to try your's instead of the one that is presented.

First, I agree with those who dislike reading reviews of the reviewer's recipe rather than the one one the website.  That said, I made this pretty much as written, but used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, since chicken and tuna didn't sound like a good combination to me.  I liked the garlic soup much better than the regular COM I use in tuna casserole.  The canned french fried onions really added a nice kick.

Very good tuna and pasta casserole!  A little dry around the edges, but still very good.  I used 2 cans of soup, and 2 cans of tuna.  All in all, it came out well!

I didn't like tuna casserole, but now I do.  I felt a little guilty about not making tuna cassarole for my husband, so I decided to make it even though I thought it would be disgusting.  I even loved it.  My whole family loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

This casserole was absolutely awesome.  It is SO simple to make, and my family LOVED it.  Specifics for how I made it - I used chunk white albacore, sharp cheddar cheese, and larger portions which meant 3 cans of soup - I used 2 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom, just because I didn't have another cream of chicken.  It was awesome, and even my picky eaters (of which I have at least 3 on any given night) had seconds.  

My husband suggested the addition of some onions actually IN the casserole, which might be tasty.  Alternately, I served it last night with a big green salad with red onions (and a lot of other veggies), and the onions in the salad just went REALLY nicely with the casserole.

AWESOME!  Thanks for posting this!

I am not to sure what everyone else is eating, but this recipe was very very bland.  I made it with the cream of mushroom soup and added extra mayo so it wouldn't be dry.  Instead of french fried onions I used italian bread crumbs and topped it with shredded parmesan cheese.  I also added salt and pepper, paprika, cheddar cheese, and other seasonings to try and make it taste like something.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone and I won't make it again.  Tuna Helper would have been a better choice!

My daughter wanted Tuna Helper and I could not bring myself to buy that .  I searched and found this excellent recipe.  Oh man, what a HIT in my house.  I barely had enough leftovers for my daughters lunch for school the next day.  I didn't use macaroni.  I used a bag of egg noodles, but had to use more cream of chicken soup.  I also added two cans of tuna fish.  I added finely diced onion and peas.  I like things cheesey and folded in some cheese and added more on top.  The French Onions was a nice topping!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

1 1/2 cups uncooked pasta yields 3 cups cooked pasta.  I found this out after cooking up about 2 cups.  My boys ate this casserole right down with no complaints so it is definitely a keeper.  It tasted just like I expected maybe a little bland since I used the fat free cream of chicken soup.  I added a little milk and used albacore tuna.

My husband was skeptical about tuna casserole, but as I'm looking for ways to cut our grocery bill, this seemed like an inexpensive recipe.  I added some milk and seasonings like the other reviewers suggested, and it turned out SO yummy!  I was hoping for leftovers, but my husband finished it off!! Watch the fried onions carefully because I discovered they go from nicely browned to burned in a matter of seconds.

Good basic recipe but I found it needed some modfications as well. I ended up using 1/2 c. milk, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 2 tins tuna, 4 c. egg noodles, 3 chopped green onions, and a teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder. Next time I'll add in some peas and carrots for a more well rounded casserole.

I, too, changed some of the ingredients, but this is a good base recipe.  I used 3 cups cooked macaroni (1 1/2 cups dry)and 2 cans of tuna.  I combined the can of mushroom soup with a 1/2 can of milk and stirred in a cup of frozen peas and added 1 tsp Worchestershire sauce.  After the macaroni was cooked and drained, I mixed all ingredients in the casserole dish and stirred in 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese.  I topped all with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and baked as directed.  My family loves this, including my 10 year old son that doesn't like tuna!

I thought this was a good meal.  I changed things around a bit though.  I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans of tuna, and I mixed about 1 and half cups of cheddar cheese with the macaroni.  I then added about a 1/4 cup of milk through the over the mixture and topped with cheddar.  I did not use the onions.  I also covered with aluminum foil for about 15 min.  The meal turned out very creamy and good.  My son loved it.  My husband didn't really like the mushrooms, but I thought it was really good.

My boyfriend was gone to a fire dept training course this past weekend, which gave me the liberty to make this easy dish (he's not fond of tuna casseroles and will only eat them every once in a while). Pretty good stuff! Per other suggestions, I added just a little milk (maybe 1/3c) to the soup so that it would be more creamy, added some minced onion, a little more cheese and then mixed in a jar of drained diced pimentos for color. The french fried onions give it a neat touch and would make this again! Indeed this is very easy and a good taste to boot! Thanks Linday!

Fantastic "blueprint" for a delicious casserole.  I made it with the following substitutions:  1 12oz. can tuna, 2 cans Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup, 2 cups uncooked macaroni, handful of frozen peas.  Colorful, slightly spicy, creamy...absolutely wonderful.  (I am quite convinced that green chilies would be a nice addition, but my husband does not care for spicy as much as I do.)

Good, even my husband liked this and he is not a fan of tuna casseroles. I have also made this with canned salmon...it turned out pretty good. This is a recipe that I will keep on hand.

My family loved this recipe! Husband and sons both had seconds and asked for me to make it again. I did add a half bag of mixed vegggies and doubled the tuna, soup and used 4C of pasta to make more. Only small complaint I had was I think it was a little dry so next time I'll try a little milk added. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for over 30 years, and it's always been a great hit.  Lately, I have made a few minor changes that I like better.  I add about 1/8 cup of evaporated milk to cut down on any dryness.  I crush enough Ritz crackers that make about 2 cups and mix with melted butter until slightly moisten, and then sprinkle on top on the casserole before baking.  I also use about 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar cheese.  We are cheese lovers, so this makes the dish a lot better for us.

And personally, it doesn't bother me in the least bit to see people make changes in a recipe.  I get new ideas that way. :)  But I will say, if you are going to alter the recipe, you should still give a 5 star rating to the person who posted it in the first place.  It's not their fault if your taste buds like something different.

Great,easy recipe.  I love to read about the changes people make and I incorporated some of the changes myself.  Real fried onions were good and I stayed away from those canned french fried things whatever they are. Peas were a great addition always love using them,  I love the pop they produce in my mouth. I used a T of Mayo and a T of horseradish mustard. Loved it.  Keep up the experimenting it's fun and I always find it interesting at the very least.

This recipe is almost identical to the one our family (& I'll bet many others) has been making for generations (over 35 years in our family, if I had to guess I'd say it originated as a Campbell's ad. The magazine clipping in our old recipe box says 1/2 pkg egg noodles, 1 can Campbell's condensed cream of mushroom soup, 1 can tuna, 1/2 cup milk, plus optional slices of American cheese & French fried onions for topping. I think this recipe needs the milk to it to thin it out a bit, so I have to wonder if the submitter forgot to add it. I've made it with all kinds of pasta (macaroni, penne, even spaghetti) & various condensed "cream of" soups (our current fave is "cream of mushroom with roasted garlic"). It's ok as a budget-recipe with 1 can of tuna, but I always doubled the tuna, & we've always preferred it with shredded sharp cheddar. The French fried onions can be subbed with bread crumbs or crushed corn chips (Ranch Doritos are good), depends on what we have on hand. I usually turn this into a one-dish meal by adding a box or pkg of frozen veggies - peas, green beans, or carrots (or a mix veg blend with all 3) are great & add color to the dish. If if do add the frozen veggies I don't pre-cook them, just toss them frozen into the boiling pasta about 2 minutes before the pasta is done. I give the recipe posted here 4 stars for flavor, minus 1 star for not having milk in it, plus 1 star for being so easy to make with ingredients we almost always have on hand = total 4 stars.

This is an excellent recipe.  And while I agree with those who say we should try the recipe as written before rating it, one of the things I like most about the rating system is reading ideas others have about how to adjust and possibly improve the recipe.  In addition, some minor adjustments due to what is on hand, or dietary needs are sometimes necessary, and should be noted.  For example, I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used colby jack.  My daughter is a pescitarian (doesn't eat any meat other than fish and sea food) so I used mushroom soup instead of chicken.  I also added peas as suggested by one reviewer to make this a one dish meal.  Despite the changes I made, I feel comfortable rating the recipe.  Based on my experience I can say that it turned out just slightly dry, next time I might add some sour cream, or mayonaise, as others suggested.  But all in all this was and EXCELLENT basic recipe, which lived up to its EASY name.  I will use it again!  Thanks so much!

Prefer potato chips on top! Add frozen peas and two tins of tuna.
As a basic this receipe is fine...but as usual, each 'cook' must fine tune it!
I also used green  durum wheat semolina pasta...just to be different!
Making a more creative tuna casserole is fun and everyone enjoyed it.

My roommate and I aren't really Tuna fans but I had all the ingredients except for the cheese and French's Fried Onions so I used shredded Mexican 3 Cheese and just skipped the French's step and it turned out fantastic! Both of us chowed down and it was the perfect amount to eat!

Made this the other day at 3PM.  At first I thought it was really great, but when dinner came I reheated it, added milk, and it was very dry and did not look appealing at all.  I was a little embarrassed to present it to my hubby for dinner.  As I did not cook anything else he ate it, but did not issue any compliment at all (which is very rare).  This is the 1st recipe I'm not giving 5 stars to, I'm that easy to please, but this one is just really 3 stars for me.  Half of the stuff I made is still sitting in the pan in the fridge, and I'm not sure when we'll finish it.

Super simple and surprisingly tasty.  Followed the advice of others and added another can of tuna and an additional can of condensed soup (mushroom).  The consistency came out perfectly, and have to agree with another reviewer: Don't skimp on the fried onions.  They totally make the dish.  Some mentioned that a 9x13 pan is too big, but with the doubling I mentioned and just a bit more pasta than called for, I thought the amount worked well.  Had the pan been any fuller, the ratio of fried onions to noodles/tuna mixture would have been off.  Anyhow, highly recommend for a quick and easy comfort food dish.  Yummy with some sriracha dribbled over top if you like some kick.

I think I finally found my go-to tuna casserole recipe!  I have tried a bunch here and on other recipe websites but none have come out as well as this one.  I made some minor changes mostly because of what I had on hand.  

I used egg noodles instead of macaroni and I doubled the main ingredients (I eyeballed the onions) because I wanted plenty of leftovers.  I also added a soup can full of milk because EVERY other tuna casserole I've made has come out too dry for my liking.  I also added an extra, small can of mushrooms, drained (because I like them) and some peas (just so there was a veggie in dinner).

Instead of shredded Cheddar, I used a bunch of those Kraft American cheese singles to cover the top.  I usually don't eat them but they melt beautifully and they were great on the top of this dish.  I think they helped seal in the moisture that made this come out perfectly melty and delicious.  Mmm... I just ate it for dinner an hour ago and typing this makes me want to get another bowl. 

  The French fried onions on top added some crunch and great flavor, much better than the bread crumbs or crushed potato chips I've tried in other recipes.  I don't think I'll make a different tuna casserole dish again.

This recipe was not very good as written, and could be much better.   I can't wait to modify this next time. That is all.

I hate tuna caserole.  My hubby made this while I was at scouts with printed instructions and a few reviews.  It turned out fabulous...I had seconds.  The kids enjoyed it also.  The tuna smell/taste wasn't as noticable as in other casseroles.  Adding this to our menu!!

Me and my husband ate this whole thing last night, it was so good!  My kids wouldn't even try it to know that they would love it so that was too bad, but I'll keep trying.  This recipe was perfect.  As a personal preference, I added 1/2 cup milk but it would have been fine without, I was just hoping to get a little extra creaminess since I thought it would make it more appealing to my kids.  Also, it was incredibly easy to make which I appreciate.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this as it is written and it was a bit bland. I added a little salt and it was much better. My husband loved it!

One note if you are trying to fill the whole 9x13 baking pan: double the recipe.

When adding extra noodles and tuna, make sure to add a second can of cream of chicken soup.  It's TOO dry when you don't.

I love this recipe but made a few changes lol. Instead of macaroni I used rotini (my fave), I only used half a cup of cheddar and substituted the other half with pepper jack for a little bit of spiciness and instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom.

Yum! I guess I am just one of "those" folks who still enjoys the foods of my childhood - tuna casserole, meatloaf, beans 'n franks.... This took me on a wonderful trip down memory lane. :) Not only was this cheap and SUPER easy to throw together, it was comforting and filling too. I agree wih several other reviewers who commented about sticking to the recipe. Please do yourself a favor and try this AS IS, only making slight modifications to suit your tastes (or what you have on hand). Is this recipe perfect? No. Is it a fun twist on an old favorite? Yes! I pretty much followed LMCDEVIT's directions to the letter except for a few minor changes. I added 1/4 t pepper, 1/2 t garlic salt and a small (8 oz.) can of drained peas to my casserole. Next time, I'll be sure to add another can of tuna (there wasn't enough, IMHO). These are the ONLY changes I recommend. NOTE: Three cups cooked pasta is equivalent to approximately 1 1/2 cups dried. As a general rule, the volume of cooked pasta is double what it is uncooked. Thanks for sharing, LMCDEVIT. You certainly give JAICARD's best tuna casserole (my favorite!) a good run for the title of world's most awesome tuna casserole - EVER! :-)

I was really suprised. I thought this would be better  considering all the reviews and simplicity of the recipe. My family ate it to be polite and knew they were my "lab rats" for the night. They did not want me to repeat this one. Sorry. It wasn't inedible. I didn't add or take away from the recipe but I did use a 2 qt dish instead of a 9x13.

Love this! Only gave this four stars because it was too easy! Didn't seem fair to those who suffer over much more complicated dishes. That said, if you're quick in the kitchen, and already have water boiling for macaroni, the whole thing is oven-ready in ten minutes--five if you don't include cooking the macaroni.  Thanks, LM--it's a great last minute "throw together" after a too-long day. Will do this again--and again. Yay, comfort food!

I would have given this a 5 because it was very tasty, but it came out rather dry.  I really liked the flavor though, and will make it again but I'll try to either add some milk or sour cream, or add another can of condensed soup.  This was a super easy meal to throw together with ingredients I already had on hand.  Nice comfort food with little effort.

Super easy. Read over the reviews and made a couple of additions. I added an additional can of tuna, a bit of lemon juice, cayenne pepper and Old Bay Seasoning. I tossed in some peas. I also added 1 cup of milk. I topped with both cheddar cheese and Parmesan . I did not use the fried onions. It still turned out a bit dry, so next time I think I'll add 2 cans of soup or up the milk.

First of all Thank you to Lexi1230 for the cooked/uncooked macaroni conversion, that was a big help to me.
I made this tonight, (and posted a pic) it was DELISH!! 
I added a dash of garlic salt and as suggested by others a can of cream of mushroom soup. I used more shredded cheddar as I LOVE cheese!! 
My hubby and I both loved this!! It's a keeper for sure!  Try this, you will NOT be sorry! 
Thanks for sharing!!

This is such an easy recipe.  I made it as is and it was a huge hit with my 5 year old.  I see this becoming a regular recipe in our household.  This will easily translate into a nice balanced meal for lunch at school in a thermos.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, however I used what I had on hand. Substituted Cream of Mushroom & used a pkg of shredded Colby and Monteray Jack for cheese. Added peas and a couple of tablespoon of sour cream, and black pepper.  Love the french fried onion rings! Yum!

This recipe was awesome!  However, If you want to feed a family of 4+ double this recipe!!  My husband, two-year old, and I ate the entire caserole in one sitting (without stuffing ourselves).  I also think that I am going to try preparing this recipe with fresh tuna next time...  Mmmmm

This is one of the best I've had. I used salmon instead though, and put half cream of chicken, then half cream of mushroom until it was the consistency I liked. Added a can is corn, salt and pepper, soooo good!!

I love this basic recipe with a few alterations.  I mince some onion, add frozen peas and fresh or canned mushrooms, depending on what's available. also i spice with a little garlic and onion seasoning, use parmesan instead of yellow cheese, sprinkle with bread crumbs. Oh, by the way, i like reading peoples alteration, for example, i would not have thought to fry up my own onions to use as a topping-great idea (my boyfriend always eats up all the Durkies)!

Quick and easy and good.  I did add 1 chopped onion sauteed in 1 tbsp. butter, an additional can of tuna and a soup can full of milk.  Used one box of elbows.  Skipped the FF onions b/c I didn't have them; sprinkled extra cheese on top before baking.  May be a little dry without extra soup or milk, but deserves 5 stars for the ease and adjustability.

I was seriously scared to make this after reading some of the negative reviews but I devoured more than half of this after it came out of the oven.  It was so simple and yummy.  Really made my day a lot happier and warmer.  The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 can of milk to make it creamier.  I will be making this again when I need a break from cooking after work.

Soo Good, Soo Easy!  My son who is a very picky eater - loved it.  Of course, I did not tell him there was tuna in it! I made it will a 1 pnd bag of wide egg noodles, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of milk.  I doubled the cheese and mixed half in the with the soup and the noodles and the rest on top.  This is an excellent, easy, cheap dinner on a work night. The only thing I think I will do different next time is to cover the the dish during the first round of cooking to keep it moist.  Many thanks!

I dont give many 5 stars but I'm doing it for this recipe because it is super easy and fast and made just as is, is simply delicious! Of course there are always ways to tweek it to your own liking and make it better but a great recipe as it is! Thank you!  ( I will go ahead and post the changes I made the second time that we loved. Doubled the recipe and used 1 can cream of chic. one can cream of mush, slightly less cheese but used sharp cheddar for a potent flavor. Would have been even more delicious with peas and fresh mushrooms but didnt have any on hand)

I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom and an extra can of albacore tuna as well as 3/4 can of milk.  I can't say that this recipe was bad, but I can't say that anybody really raved about it either, it was just so - so.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Excellent - my husband loved it and never realized I used whole wheat pasta.  I even forgot to get the french fried onions and it was still great!  I did add 1 cup mayo and it was very creamy.  This will be a regular at our house!

This is an amazingly quick recipe that my whole family ate and loved. I can finally get all of them to eat tuna!

This recipe is completely tasteless.  It is way too much macaroni for the amount of soup.  The dish was very dry and had absolutely NO flavor.  I would never make this recipe again, even with changes made.  I will continue my search for a delicious tuna noodle casserole recipe because I certainly did not find it here.

This was so simple and easy to make, and tasted pretty good too. Came out just slightly dry so next time I will add a few tablespoons of milk I think. Otherwise it was great! I liked the fried onions on the top because I thought it gave the casserole a slightly different taste than the one I'm used to. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe as is. I didn't make any changes and I thought it turned out delicious. It was so easy to make. And even my super picky 4 year old will eat it.

I doubled the tuna in this recipe and it was delicious.  I also inadvertently used the fat free cream of chicken soup, but it seemed perfectly fine to me. Next time I will double the cream of chicken soup for a creamier dish.  My boyfriend loved it too.

I used 2 cans of tuna, and a can of condensed cream of mushroom in addition to the cream of chicken. I added 1/2 cup of milk and the texture was perfect!! It was thick and creamy, not dried out at all, and not liquidy either. I topped the casserole with 3 cups crushed potato chips because I didn't have French fried onions. The casserole was very yummy. Next time, I will add in some seasoning because it was just a bit bland.

I was tempted to make adjustments to the recipe, but figured I'd try it the way it was written first.  It was really good and I won't change a thing next time.  Topped with a little hot sauce, it was perfect!

This is a solid tuna casserole recipe, and I agree with the other posts:  don't rate others if you make major changes to their recipes.  Post your customized recipe, then rate yourself.    The only criticism I have is that a 9x13 baking dish is too big.  If you want a casserole that big, double the recipe.  I used a smaller casserole dish and I still don't think it came out deep enough.  I would also add some chopped onion for flavor.  That being said, I give four stars based purely on taste.  I liked it, and so did my daughter.

After mixing the can of soup with the noodles & tuna, it was SO thick!  So I took the advice of one of the reviews and added a couple big spoonfuls of sour cream to it, and also sprinkled some of the grated cheese into it. (Put the rest on top as directed) Also, I didn't put it back into the oven with the FF onions. Would have made them soft doing that!  My family enjoyed this, but the amounts really only serve 4 people.

Made this recipe by the recipe, when to came to the French Fried Onions I used a homemade recipe, and used Red Onions, Flour, and Milk coated the onions and then fry them in oil before sprinkling them ontop of the Casserole.

Best tuna casserole I have ever had. Used Velveeta cubes for the mixture. Egg noodles. And sharp cheddar for the top. Added milk so it wouldn't be so dry. This one is a keeper.

This is such a versatile basic recipe that can be altered based on what you have in the fridge. I agree with the previous reviewer but also disagree a bit. I don't think it is rude, I like to think of it more as people being able to adapt the recipe to the ingredients in the home. :) I know I did. I doubled it and added peas and red pepper, just for colour. It was delicious. Half the cheese was mixed in with the ingredients and the other half was on top. I served it with boiled brussel sprouts. Oh and sauteed onions on top makes this dish Royal!!! My son's friend was over after supper at his house and still ate 2 helpings :) Tells you something about the recipe... Thanks! Two thumbs up from us!

I reviewed this ages ago. I have no idea where my review went. You can pretty much use an array of cream of soup in this recipe. I will sometimes use cheddar cheese. My kids favor this for a quick dinner on it's own, I like it with steamed cauliflower or shredded raw coleslaw mix stirred in. Most of the ingredients for this can be bought on the cheap from a discount grocery store or dollar store.

Excellent and Super Easy! I'm a fan of quick, delicious meals and this fits the bill perfectly. I doubled the recipe because I had the ingredients to do so, and my family loves leftovers. It was fabulous! If my 3year old gobbles it up I always consider it a success, and this was no exception! I mixed the tuna and soup in a bowl before adding them to the pasta for even distribution, and this worked best for me. The onions on top are the best part in my opinion, adding flavor and a little crunch. I didn't quite have enough to double the onions, but next time I will make sure I do. The more, the better! Thanks for sharing!

I'm a new bride and a future Mommy all rolled into one package:)!  I was craving tuna casserole and I know that it's fairly inexpensive to make.  This recipe was nice and I always add or change things when I make recipes for some reason.  I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, one can of evaporated milk, a little onion salt/garlic powder/pepper, and I added in a little corn that was part of my leftovers.  Plus, I added in cheddar french fried onions into the casserole along with an extra can of tuna along with some cheese slices.  My husband loved it and I love it because it's creamy comfort food that's easy to make!  I did add a little butter into this also because I know that is something that my Mom has always added to her tuna casserole over the years.  I added some peaches on the side to this and it made a complete meal!

I was sooo pleased with this recipe! I am a college student, and of course money is always tight. This casserole is honestly so easy to make, and the price is right. I added steamed peas to the tuna mix, and then added 2 cups of cheese (i'm a cheese lover) over the top of the mix before I put the pan in the oven. This is definitely my new favorite--it beats buying tuna helper, tastes better, and is from scratch (making you look like a pro chef)!

Tasty, hearty casserole. made no changes but might suggest doubling the amount of soup as I found it to be a little on the dry side. Other than that, great dish.

My mother's recipe is the same, but instead of onion rings on top, we add crushed potato chips on the cheese.
Delicious and very comforting...

Ok, this by far is the best tune casserole I've ever had. Even my kids who don't like tuna LOVE this casserole.
Some things I did different: Used 2 cans of tuna and 1 cans of crm of chicken, and I put 3/4C of french fried onion with the noodles and tuna mixture and then 3/4 on top when almost cooked along with shredded cheese. It's delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

Okay, so I'm giving this 4 stars because I had to change so much about it.
Here's what I added
2x the tuna
1 can fat free crm of mush
1 can fat free crm of celery
2 tbsp sour cream
2 tbsp fat free mayo
1 tbsp Grey Poupon
1 tsp minced garlic (the jarred kind)
1 can of peas
1 c. cooked mixed frozen veggie
I also used about 4cups of mixed noodles

This turned out amazingly!
My husband went back for 2nds, and also took some to work for lunch today. I'm eating the leftovers right now, and they're superb!
No complaints here!
The only issue was that this recipe makes WAY too much for 2 people. It's more for like 6 people or more.
Thank God for Seal-A-Meal!!!

This was a quick and easy recipe that I'll be sure to keep. As another reviewer advised, definitely keep an eye on the onions so they don't burn. I used a round 1.5 quart baking dish and that was the perfect size, a 9x13 pan would have been much too big for the amount this recipe makes.

I really enjoyed this dish! It had the classic taste and creamy texture that I have been looking for. As others had suggested, instead of using the Crm of chicken, I used 1 can of Crm of celery and 1 can of Crm of mushroom. I also doubled the amount of tuna, added 1 c. of milk, 2tbsp mayo, and 1/2 c. peas.

I used a box of velveeta shells and cheese, with a can of tuna, can of soup and all the other ingredients.  Using the velveeta shells and cheese, I didn't have to use any more cheese and I added a little milk to make it creamier.  My family absolutely loved it and my husband (who is not a fan of tuna) ate all the leftovers!!!

I gave this 5 stars not b/c it is impressive cuisine (wouldn't want to serve it to special company) but b/c it beats the socks off tuna helper (which my kids actually like, so they loved this)!!  I used 2 cans of tuna...1 can of cream of celery soup...1/4 cup mayo...1/4 cup (? maybe less?) of finely chopped onion...1 cup of borden six-cheese italian cheese blend (I think it has mozarella, paremsan, asiago, provolone, romano,etc)....1/4-1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (not sure how much, I just guessed it)....and about 2 cups of cooked egg noodles.  I didn't have fench fried onions so I used 2 tablespoons melted butter mixed with about 1/2 cup bread crumbs, sprinkled that over the top.   I baked it till the bread crumbs were browned.

I should of read the reviews before I tried it, else I would of added the garlic powder and mayo as suggested. This was pretty good, but a little on the bland side and I should of probably made half because now I have a whole pan of this stuff in my fridge. I'll probably make it again with the alterations. Thanks!

I used 1 can of cream chicken soup, 1 can of cream mushroom, 1/3 c. milk, cheese/fried onions to taste, and an extra can of tuna. My husband thought it was wonderful (reheats nicely as well). It was very good and simple, even though I'm not a huge fan of tuna.

This was wonderful comfort food and super easy.  I used cream of celery soup instead and it was delicious.  Next time I think I'll add both and/or a can of mushrooms.  I also used corkscrew pasta so the soup would cling to it more than the macaroni.  I cooked it an extra 5 minutes so the fried onions and cheese were bubbly and extra crispy.

This made a nice lunch.  It was creamy but very mild in flavor.  I used thin spiral stick pasta and added salt, pepper, and water chestnuts and omitted the French onions.

A really good recipe - easy, tasty and adaptable.  I added 1/4+ cup milk to soup mixture (because some reviewers said it was a little dry).  It came out great!  The second time, I used cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chicken) and added some sliced mushrooms from a jar.  Even better!!  (I didn't realize the cheese was supposed to go on top - I put it in with the soup mixture - came out great anyway.)

I am a novice cook and have had many disappointments (just ask my husband.)  He actually asked for seconds on this one.  I was thrilled.  Really easy to make.  My daughter wouldn't touch it (7 years old) but she won't eat anything anyway.

Loved this recipe!  Quick and easy.  I did substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken because I had the cr.of mushroom on hand. Used two cans of it and two cans of tuna since it's baked in a 9x13 dish.  Came out great and everyone loved it. Even my twin grandsons who usually are hard to please!

I doubled the recipe for the 9x13 in Pyrex pan. It was perfect according to my 11yr old son who is picky when it comes to food such as not putting the cheese on one side.

Based on the recipe as written, I think this is a good base for someone looking for ideas. Although I do think that recipes should be rated as written, I also think it's helpful to read changes that people made to improve it. The changes may or may not be accepted by the reader depending on their tastes. I gave the recipe 5 stars because I think it would be good as written, but I did make changes to accommodate the tastes of my family. 

I cooked 1 1/2 cups of macaroni to make 3 cups of cooked macaroni. I added an additional can of tuna, used 2 cans of cream of cream of chicken soup, a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper, 1/2 soup can milk, 2 cans of sliced mushrooms, and 8 ounces frozen peas. I mixed 3/4 of the  shredded cheddar into the hot drained noodles before the other ingredients and mixed until the cheese melted. After pouring the mixture into the baking dish, I used enough shredded cheese to cover the top and also added some shredded Colby cheese.  

I crushed the French fried onions to put on top. The onions were really good and added more flavor, but if you don't have this on hand, you can mix 8 tbsp. seasoned bread crumbs  and 4 tbsp. melted butter to use on top instead. 

All in all, I think the recipe as written would have been OK. With the changes I made, it was excellent and more like the kind of food my family is used to.  It did make more than we could eat in one meal, and the leftovers froze and rewar

I accidentally added the cup of cheese to the cream of chicken soup the first time I made it.  It was excellent.  I just added cheese on top also.  I used the cream of chicken with herbs kind which gave it a good flavor.

As is, totally yummo.  All eight of my kids gobbled it up.  My only change is I use more ingredients: 4 boxes of mac n cheese (made per directions), 1 large can cream of chicken, 4 cans of tuna.  Mix that all up and top with cheese and bake as directed and add the yummy crunchy onions :)

This casserole is not too "tuna-y" like some others.  Per other reviews, I added one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery and then added enough milk to make a nice creamy texture before popping it into the oven.  We don't care for the onions so I added some smashed croutons to the top for an extra crunch.  Very yummy!  I would certainly make this again!

This is a great recipe and easily adjusted. I boiled 2 cups of uncooked macaroni, added one can of Cream of Chicken, a little milk and some sour cream I wanted to use up. I put an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar on top and baked until bubbly, then used an entire 6 oz can of French Fried Onions on top of that, baking another 5 minutes. I'm not the best in the kitchen, but I was very happy with how this turned out and my family asked for seconds :)

Very good recipe. I used 1 LB of pasta, and doubled everything else. I added a cup of milk, and some frozen peas to the pasta during last few minutes of cooking. Seasoned to my taste. Next time I will do something to add some more moisture.

I thought I had cream of chicken soup but after digging through my pantry all I could find was cream of celery so I had to use that. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as is. It's good though a little bland for my taste. I like to mix the soup and the tuna in the casserole dish before adding the noodles. This breaks up the tuna so it's in smaller bits and it's more easily mixed in with the noodles.  I like the way the onions get browned and even crispier. I've never tried them before and had trouble keeping myself from eating them all before adding them to the casserole!  have no complaints about it but next time I will try some add ins.

Made this recipe for the first time last night.  Loved it!  My son had 2 helpings.  It is definitely one that I will make regularly.  I had never used french fried onions before and these gave the casserole a nice, tasty touch.  I also didn't have cheddar cheese on had and used 4 Cheese Italiano and this worked well.

Excellent just as written! This was a quick and easy dinner after a busy day. I used 1 1/2 cups dry elbow macaroni to get 3 cups cooked. Served with fresh, steamed broccoli & carrots. Bakes nicely in the cast iron dutch oven too! The Husband said it was a keeper!

I was craving Tuna noodle casserole, which I haven't had since college, a LONG time ago. It has been around forever, probably as long as Campbell's,which is 150 years! I did change it up, mainly to use up some ingredients that needed using. If you can't stand changes, then stop reading, but this was really good and flavorful! All kidding aside, this is a recipe that is just begging you to use what you have! I didn't have macaroni, so I used egg noodles. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of celery (everybody knows cream of anything is pretty much interchangeable!), I had 1/2 of a bell pepper that needed using, so in it went. I had a half of an open can of water chestnuts, so in they went as well.  I read somewhere that somebody's grandma used a splash of Worcestershire in hers and I thought that makes sense, because it has anchovies, which gives unami--so I put in a nice splash of unami.  I cooked a little too much noodles, but I didn't want to waste. To make up for the extra noodles, I tossed in a half of small container of sour cream that needed to be used and about 1/2 cup of milk. Then I sprinkled with Krazy Jane's Mixed-Up Pepper and a dash of cayenne--just to add more flavor. I messed up by stirring in the cheese and I messed up again by putting the onions on in the beginning (I just covered with foil when it started getting too brown). This was delicious. You cannot mess this up. Oh, and I used 2 cans of tuna and some peas and pimentos, just because...

Great recipe simple recipe and with the cheese adds just that extra oomf to an already great comfort food.  Since my husband won't eat anything with the word mushroom in it, the cream of chicken soup is perfect!  I agree with other reviewers, make this recipe, review it and then change it all you want to suit your taste.  If you don't try the recipe don't rate it!

Very bland the way it was as I have made it before.

This time, I fried onions till crispy brown and then sauteed one can of tuna into it. One the tuna was well fried, I added 2 tablespoons of garlic chilli oil and plenty of salt and pepper. 

I added the cream of chicken soup and added some frozen peas to the mix.

When I was ready to bake it, I made a quick crumble from italian breadcrumbs and butter. So I stirred in alittle shredded cheddar cheese, topped it with cheese and finally added the crumble.

It was AMAZING

I used 3 cups of wacky mac pasta, 2 cans of tuna in water, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with garlic, and then the cheese, and fried onions.  I also added some fresh broccoli, because I didn't have any peas on hand, and added a dash of salt, pepper, and onion powder.  It was good!

This is the BEST tuna casserole ever!  I have tried many different tuna casseroles and didn't really care for them--I was beginning to wonder why people loved tuna casserole so much!  I finally came across this one and decided to try it--so good!  We cook this at least once a month.

Not Bad! I can never remember to buy the fried onions when I'm at the store,so I cut up 5 or 6 green onion and mixed them in with the pasta/soup/tuna. For the crunchy topping, I used my favourite crunchy topping for baked mac & cheese, crushed cornflakes :)

Easy and delicious as written! I used a 6.4 oz pouch of tuna, so I didn't have to drain it. Next time, I might add peas. My family of picky eaters gobbled it up! Thanks!

I used low sodium soup and it was still somewhat salty.  I also used two cans of tuna.  Overall it was pretty good and very simple to prepare.

This was better than the other tuna casserole recipes I've tried off this site.  The french fried onions added a lot of flavor.  I did use about twice as much tuna as the recipe called for and added peas.  Next time I will add some milk as well to make it a bit more moist.

Good recipe, can easily replace salmon for tuna, and mushroom soup for chicken, depending on what you have on hand. Also I added some frozen peas to get a little more veg in the mix.

This was a good basic tuna casserole recipe.  Nice blend of flavors, but could use some extras to spice it up a bit.  I added extra tuna and peas and it was good.

Very good basic recipe. Easy to make changes without compromising the dish. I opted for cream of mushroom and a can of cheese soup and added an extra can of tuna along with 1/2 cup of sour cream for extra moisture and flavor. My hubby loved the fried onion topping and so did I. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

An excellent and very easy tuna casserole recipe that I will be using as my stock recipe from now on. If there are others like me who like reading the modifications, and if the author is interested, I basically doubled the recipe and compensated by using both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and a made a cheese layer on top.

My daughter had this for her birthday lunch today.  She really loved it, and the rest of the family seemed to enjoy it as well.  I thought it a bit dry, and will add a little milk next time. We did not have French's onions, so we used crushed Ritz crackers instead.  Otherwise, we pretty much followed the recipe...although we didn't measure anything. ;) Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I followed this recipe as written out.  It was good and definitely easy - not great but has potential.  As others suggested it definitely needs more tuna, something to add zip (perhaps mustard) or maybe a variety of cheeses (parmesan on top?).

The first time I made this it was terrible.  I used too many noodles.  The second time I used the recommended amount (I think 1.5C dry noodles yields 3C cooked noodles...rookie mistake). I also used 2 cans of tuna which I think is a must.  I used a can of Cream of Chicken and a can of Cream of Mushroom.  I mixed 1C of the cheese with the casserole and topped with another cup.  It was pretty creamy but good.

Delicious!  I used cream of mushroom only because I didn't have cream of chicken.  It was great.  Also, I used a high quality Italian canned tuna.  It was wonderful.

I love tuna noodle casserole.  To me, it is the best comfort food - but my husband doesn't care for it too much, so I was on the hunt for a new recipe that he'd enjoy.  This is it! He had two helpings.  I followed the recipe closely, altering the quantity of ingrediants here and there (more cheese, less pasta).  The only reviewer suggestion I followed was adding 1/2 cup of mayo for a bit more kick.  Yummy.  The fried onions really make this dish!  Thanks so much for submitting.

This is a staple recipe that I love and use all the time. I don't have the fried onions usually so I just use crushed up crackers and parmesan cheese! Also if you get tired of the same old thing you can use any kind of cream soup (broccoli or mushroom anyone?)

Easy and edible. That's about it. I think it could have used another can of soup (I used crm. of mushroom). It's very bland. I had to keep salting just to be able to eat. I just happened to have all the ingredients so I thought I'd give it  a try. I guess it was worth a shot but I won't make again unless in  a very tight pinch.

This was good for a base recipe but before I put it in the oven it seemed like it wasn't creamy enough for our taste so I added about 1/2 cup of mayo.  I also added some celery salt.  The celery salt really added a nice touch of flavor, but it still could use a little more mayo or soup or something to make it a little more moist or creamy.

5 stars for simplicity and I liked the idea of using french fried onions since I was out of bread crumbs.    Alterations:  I had no cheese but I did have two boxes of mac-n-cheese.  Added some chives, celery, pepper, and parsley. That was it.      Thank you, because my boys who are 6 and 4 years in age give me daily grief when it comes to meals, they hate this!!  ;)

I agree that when people make major changes to a recipe and review it ... it is silly!  BUT I do like it when most reviews say things like "too dry" and others give advice to add milk.  I followed recipe exact (but added 1 1/2 cup of milk) and found this recipe good.  Not great - but good and a bit bland for me.

This was a great recipe.  I made a few changes I used velveeta and added celery and peppers.  There wasn't any left so I assume it went over well.

So easy, even I could make it. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand - had to use cream of mushroom soup - and unfortunately had to forgo the french onions. It was still yummy. FYI - Had to look up uncooked to cooked noodle conversion - used 3/4 cup of uncooked to get 3 cups cooked. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

The fam LOVED this one.  I am not giving it a 5 because I altered the recipe.  My changes: 2-1/2 cups cheddar, 3/4 cup frozen peas, 3/4 cup frozen corn, 1 can condensed cream of chicken, 1 can condensed cream of celery, 1-1/2 Tbl minced garlic and 2 cups potato chips.  Also used celery salt, garlic powder and pepper to taste.  I don't eat seafood but the rest do.  My daughter said this was her FAVORITE casserole (WOW!).  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction since I didn't know much about how to prepare this (since I don't eat seafood).  Will keep this one as a frequent flyer.

This recipe didn't turn out well for me.  When I put everything in the casserole dish it didn't look right to me but I went with it.  I was right because as it started to cook there wasn't enough liquid to even cook the pasta so I had to add milk and hot water to get the moisture in there.  I also added some seasonings to give it more flavor.

This was a great recipe! My husband was not thrilled when he found out I was making something with tuna, but it suprised him that it tasted so good. I loved it too and the only changes I made was added frozen peas & carrots and topped it with crushed potato chips. Delicious!

Great!! If you are broke this is the recipe for you!  It is the day before pay day and all I had in my cabinet was spaghetti noodles, tuna fish, and cream of mushroom soup.  It did come out a bit dry but I thought it tasted great and so did my husband.  I didn't have any cheese or french fried onions but it was great all the same!!

This is a very good and easy basic recipe you can easily alter to your tastes. The first time, I used chicken broth and added green beans (his side) and frozen peas (my side) to it. My husband really liked it, but it tasted way too much like chicken noodle soup for me to enjoy very much. The next time around, I made it with a can of cream of cheddar with added mayo/sour cream, adding green onions and leaving out the shredded cheddar, and it was AWESOME. The french fried onions are a new and really tasty twist - you can get them cheese flavored, too!

I'm not a huge fan of tuna casseroles but this was good! My boyfriend really like it also. He ended up getting thirds. This is simplicity at its finest because most people probably already have all the ingredients in their pantry. This is also a great dinner if you're pressed for time or on a budget. I made a mistake by adding the cheese in with the noodles and milk after I boiled the noodles they were hot and melted the cheese. I realized, after a mixed the ingredients, that I was supposed to put the cheese on top. It was a good mistake though because my casserole came out nice and creamy. The only other changes I made besides the cheese mistake was added a little bit of milk and pepper to taste. I also added some extra cheese on top! Very good!

This is so darn good!  I used spiral noodles, and undercooked them slightly so they would not get mushy from baking.  Goes great with a simple salad, super easy... loved it!

Used spiral pasta and added a second can of tuna an a second can of cream of chicken.  It was PERFECT that way!  I think it would be pretty dry with out it.

I crave tuna casserole every once in a while, so I made this for a quick lunch over the weekend.  It came together quickly and was really very tasty.  The only changes I made were to use cheddar jack cheese and add 1/2 cup milk to the soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first ever tuna casserole, as I have never been a big fan of tuna.  But I got sick of making the same old things and decided to try it.  It was pretty darn good.  I added a few spices and threw in some vegetables so I felt better about eating a bunch of pasta.

Good base recipe, I just added some things to accomodate our tastes. Sauteed celery, mushrooms, and green beans in some olive oil while the pasta was cooking. I didn't have enough macaroni, so I used mini farafalle. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken (personal preference). I also realized I was out of shredded cheese, so I covered the top with american cheese slices. Added plenty of garlic powder and black pepper. I also used cheddar french fried onions, yum! Obviously I changed things quite a bit, but recipes are often times just jumping off points. Thanks for the quick casserole :)

To get that five-star finish, I added a can of mushroom soup, a can of drained green beans, and seasoned with black pepper.  After it was done, I let it stand uncovered for about 10 minutes, to better allow the flavors to blend.  Tasty, and makes great leftovers!

The texture was good...otherwise bland and boring. Disappointing because all the recipes on here that are rated well have turned out great. I should have known that a recipes involving canned tuna and gooey cream soup would taste just like that.

It was all right but not the best ever. I added a can of mushroom soup, 1/4 milk, another can of tuna, and a 1/2 can of peas as the other reviewers suggested but it just wasn't that flavorful. The chicken soup tends to outweigh the flavor of the tuna. It was creamy enough but not was rather bland. Loved the onions as the topping and will keep that for any other recipe I try. This would be good in a pinch. As long as you have the ingredients on hand, you know you have a serviceable dinner ready to go but nothing to rave about. I will keep looking for a great tuna casserole recipe.

Update: After making this again, I made sure to measure 3 cups COOKED noodles, not before cooking and it was very good, not dry-------------Review #1:Super easy, but not the best. I had to add chicken broth before cooking because it was way too thick even before cooking. Was super easy in a pinch though!

My family loved it! I did use cream of mushroom, but will try the cream of chicken too! I  also added 1 can of milk. Next time I will use 2 cans of soup and maybe some sour cream for a creamier texture. Just a personal preference! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

While it's not great, we really enjoyed this casserole considering we're not nuts about tuna casserole.  It's certainly better than most. One of the pictures seems to have peas.  I think a little cheese and peas would be great additions.

so good!  i only had cream of mushroom on hand; so, i used that instead.  (i wonder if that kept it from being bland as others noted.)  also, i added some frozen carrots and peas for color. :p  loved that it was so quick and easy.  no other changes necessary.

I just happened to have all the ingredients except for the cheese.  I shredded about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese and mixed it in and used canned peas, which I added with the cheese.  Easy, Good, and makes a lot!

Finally, a tuna casserole recipe with no mushroom soup! I'm deathly allergic to mushrooms and finding a recipe that doesn't use them is a refreshing change. I personally don't use any soup for my casserole, but mine isn't easy either. Kudos!

This is a good basic recipe, but needs modification.  Final product was 4 starts but I gave it three because it required some modification.  As other reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 can of milk to avoid it being dry.  I used 6 oz of canned chicken and added 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning.  Also, as is, there is no way this feeds 8.  It fed by husband and 3 kids under 7.  I would double it next time to feed 4-6 adults.

This is pretty good! And my 2.5 year old ate it, which means I'll be making it again! Like others, I added another can of tuna. I used broccoli cheese soup and added 1/2 can of milk. I also used bread crumbs rather than the onions, and added chopped onions to the mix. I added some spices as well.

Hey, y'all!  My family LOVED this recipe!  It is absolutely comfort food!  I did take most of the suggestions of "Martins" on page 3 of the reviews.  I used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 (2 cup) package of velveeta cheese and about a half cup of milk.  I did use seasoned bread crumbs mixed with butter on top instead of the onions.  I did sautee onions in butter and added them at the beginning to the soups.  I used 1 tsp of garlic powder, also.  I did bake it for 45 minutes.  Delicious!!

Excellent!  It was easy and delicious!!The only change I might make is to bake it in a 7 x 11 rather than a 13 x 9 pan.

What a great recipe to use up all the extra tuna cans I've collected in the pantry! I morphed about 5 tuna casserole dishes together but I based the idea off of this recipe. Easy to make and quick!

I halved the cheese and used two cups of uncooked bowtie pasta.  I also added fresh chopped onion, frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, etc.) and some chopped garlic.  My family absolutely loved it!  My dad usually does not like cheesy stuff, but he loved this.

This was wonderfully easy to make and quiet quick, but like others who have rated this recipe a little on the bland side. That was quickly remedied by some seasoning salt and a bit of extra sour cream. I like this cassarole because anything (pretty much) could go into it!! Leftovers, extra dairy something or others, any kind of pasta, the possibilities are endless!!!

Sounds yummy. I made some the other day, but I used creamed mushroom soup, instead of creamed chicken soup, plus I added 1/ cup of diced celery! If you like mushrooms & more veggies, you will like this addition!

This was very good!  I doubled the soup and tuna amounts after reading other reviews and baked it in a 2-1/2 quart dish so it wouldn't dry out.  The french fried onions are a nice touch!

This was WONDERFUL and a HIT in my house!  Talk about comfort food and YUMMY! 

The only thing I did different was to use egg noodles and I added the 1 cup of cheese TO the casserole, not on top of it (cheesy goodness!!!).  

I didn't have any french onions, so I substituted: put some Ritz Veggie crackers in a baggie, drizzled in some EVOO and crushed them all up.  I then put that on top of the casserole and backed for 20 minutes...

This recipe gets 5 stars because it's easy to prepare, yummy after microwaving and even still crunchy on top, and it's unique flavor with the dried onions is fantastic. If you like tuna, double the amount. There is also enough room in the pan to double the whole recipe. I also added parmesan cheese for an extra kick on top.

I made this for a lenten Friday dinner.  To make it truely meat free, I used 1 can cream of onion soup, and 1 can cream of celary soup.  I used 1 pouch (6oz) of tuna packed in water.  I dumped it into a bowl and patted it dry with paper towels.  I also added a can of drained peas and carrots.  I did not have french fried onions for on top.  I baked in a sprayed 7x11 glass dish.  It turned out very good.  I used 2C uncooked rotennie (springs) pasta that I parboiled for about 5 minutes.  The left overs are not 'fishy'.

It gets 5 stars because of several factors. 1) it's easy to make 2) not many ingredients 3) freezes well 4) has at least a tolerable flavor to everyone in the house. I'm going to try doubling the recipe to fill a 9x13 pyrex dish, so that there will be enough to freeze for several meals during Lent.

This was surprisingly good!  I followed others' suggestions and did a bit on my own.  I wasn't sure if the "3cups cooked macaroni" meant that it was three cups before it was cooked or after.  Well, I put in 2 1/2 cups uncooked macaroni, which yielded about 5 cups.  I don't like to waste stuff, so I used it all.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 3/4 cup milk.  I sprinkled garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper.  Others said they used mayo..I was all out of mayo so I used ranch dressing.  SO GOOD!  I sliced carrots into it -- they weren't all they way cooked, partly crunchy, but I like it like that.  And used 2 cans of tuna instead of one.  Didn't have onions, so sprinkled Italian style breadcrumbs on top which also enhanced the flavor.  This made 6 large servings.  And I'm eating the leftovers right now and they're pretty good!

I was looking for a good tuna casserole recipe and this was it! I did make a few suggested changes (added milk and extra tuna, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup) Everyone loved it! Even the ones who complained when they heard what we were eating. Thank you!

Excellent!  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream on my husband's request.  I'm sure it would have been delicious without it too.  This is a super simple recipe to make in a pinch.  Thanks!

this is delicious the first time and horrible as left overs because the soup absorbs into the noodles and the onions get soggy. plan to eat the whole, delicious dish the first time or cut the recipe in half!

This is a good solid recipe, easy to make with few ingredients.  I made the recipe as directed and thought one can of tuna was plenty to not make it taste or smell too fishy.  I do think this recipe makes closer to 4-6 servings rather than 8, and it fits perfectly in a 9x9 dish - I think a 9x13 would swallow it.

With the arrival of our son, I'm always looking for easy recipes. We've tried this a few times and these are our final changes: broad egg noodles instead of pasta, cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, add 2 tins of tuna and 1/2 soup tin of milk (as per other reviewers), and add 1.5 cups of frozen mixed veggies. My husband firmly believes the onions make the recipe.

I give this 4 stars because it did need some changes to it. I followed the advice of some of the others and added 1 cup milk, 1 additional can of tuna, and also a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes. I seasoned it also with garlic powder and onion powder. It was very tasty though and seems an easy recipe to change to your liking. My 16 month old daughter ate quite a bit of her's so I am quite pleased with this!

Recipe was good when you add seasonings.  I didn't use milk just because I was too lazy to go to the store, but next time I definately will.  It turned out a little drier than I would have liked.  The house still liked it though.

I added a can of milk and stirred some cheddar cheese in before baking. I also added a few frozen peas. It could have used a little more tuna, but I thought it was delicious. Very easy to throw together.

I used 2 cans of tuna and added 1/2 soup can of milk and 1 can peas and 
2 T. Mayo.  Seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper to taste.  I would have used crushed potato chips along with the fried onions but didn't have the chips on hand this time.  I liked it and the kids ate it, but my husband isn't a fan of tuna.

Yummy, Yummy!!  I changed the recipe some using others reviews.  I used egg noodles instead of the macaroni (12 oz.) 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 cup milk, 2 cans of tuna and then added salt, pepper and granulated garlic.  I did not have the French Fried onion,  so I sliced onion very thin and cooked in butter until brown and placed on top with the cheese. 5 minutes before done, I crushed potatoe chips and put on top Will make this again:-)

Giving this a 3 only because I had to change a lot to get this to where my family would eat it.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, added an extra can of tuna (and may add one more next time), garlic powder, onion powder, a little pepper, and a can of baby peas.  With these changes, it is a 5 star recipe.

This was great with a few alterations!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a can of mushroom cream soup, an extra can of tuna, and some peas.  Halfway through baking, I tasted it but it was a little bland so I added a few tablespoons of mayonnaise, sprinkled on salt, and stirred.  That did the trick! Great for leftovers too!

My whole family loved this recipe!  I did add the extra can of tuna, frozen peas, 4oz of crumbled blue cheese, & extra can of soup as per the reviews had recommended... :) And topped it off with carmelized onions instead.  We will be making this as a family recipe for many dinners to come! Yummy! :)

I have found it hard to find a tuna casserole dish I like. This one is very good! I added peas to mine.

I used cavatappi pasta (thick, hallow spirals) boiled in water w/ a little bit of olive oil and kosher salt.  As others suggested, I used 2 cans of soup- one cream of chicken, one cream of celery (Campbell's Health Request)- and a soup can of organic milk.  Two cans of tuna is a must (I'd even consider adding another).  I added garlic powder, salt and black pepper for taste, and omitted the cheese.  It was delicious.  But even with the extra stuff I added, seemed like it still needed an extra umpf.  I will probably put fresh, sauteed onions on it next time and maybe broccoli florets inside.  Will be making this again.  Very fast and easy.  Not to mention my hubby told me it's the best tuna casserole he's ever had.  Thanks!

My husband hates casseroles (much more of a gourmet), and I'm not really fond of them - but this recipe has found its ways into our monthly line-up.  He always surprises me by asking for it.  The only change I've made is to add two cans of tuna instead of one, halve the macaroni and double the cheese.  I also use the whole can of fried onions and cook it is a wide shallow pan so there is lots of cheese and fried onions on top.  Oh, and sometimes I use the cream of mushroom with garlic soup instead.  What is so great about this recipe is I keep it in the cupboard all the time, and anytime I need a quick meal and don't feel like shopping, I pull out the cans.  Wonderful!

Not too great, but I think I'm just not a tuna casserole person.  It helped to pour a little hot sauce on it, but still wasn't that great.

This is a great basic recipe for tuna casserole! SOOOO EASY! I did add an extra can of tuna, an extra can of cream of mushroom, milk, and of course extra cheese! Also threw in a can of peas just because it had been sitting in my pantry forever and gave my baby girl some added nutrition. Thanks Lindsay!

Everyone loved this easy recipe.  Used 12 oz can of tuna instead of 6 oz because that was all I had, and it turned out great. Even with more tuna, it did not need as large a pan as recipe called for.  Husband and boys loved it.  I would double the recipe next time and add peas and/or carrots.  Great for around the holidays when you are pressed for time.

Nice versatile recipe - very easy and good.  I used rotini instead of macaroni, cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, added frozen peas and corn, and just plain fried my onions.

Not bad and very easy to make. I can't say my 4-year-old was real crazy about it but overall not a bad tuna casserole.  Give it a shot.

This is a super-fast easy recipe that I loved.  I used cream of celery soup and added a little lemon pepper spice and salt.  I used No Yolk egg noodles for the pasta and it was real light and fluffy.  The crsip onion topping was so yummy with the cheese.  The only thing I did bad was add some condensed milk to make it even more creamy, but it had a too sweet taste to me.  Maybe I should of used evaporated?? Next time I will just add some regular milk to make it super creamy, I will definately make again! THANKS

Great, easy and easy to convert (I live in Germany and can't get the creamed soup, so I bought a packet of Mushroom cream soup powder and mixed it with sour cream) tasted wonderul - I also doubled the tuna.  One of our new favourites!

This is my husband's favorite dish that I have found.  I thought it was a little dry the first time I made it so I cut back the baking time to 20 min. Now, its perfect. My hubby requests this every week, but I try not to make it that often....don't want to wear it out.

This casserole is fantastic!  Quick and easy - I added some extra tuna, used Cream of Mushroom instead of chicken, and used Velveeta cheese in addition to the cheddar - oh yeah, don't forget the peas!  Great stuff - I made a huge dish hoping to have leftovers - no such luck, by the time I got home from work it was gone =(  =))

Really, I'm surprised this recipe has gotten as good of reviews as it has. I was not very impressed. Quite blah and very dry. If it wasn't for the french fried onions, it would have been worse. It was very quick though. If I were to make it again, I'd make a lot of adjustments.

We thought this casserole was excellent. Easy to prepare and very tasty. I used 2 cups of uncooked macaroni, 2 cans of soup, a little milk to loosen it up. I did not have the onions on hand so I  topped it with buttered bread crumbs. Came out very good.

Had to add milk to loosen it up a little but it was very good. Hubby really liked it. Also used 2 cans of tuna and I would think that any cream soup you like would work just as well(potato, celery, mushroom etc.)Overall great dinner for the family.

Very good! My husband gave it a 2 thumbs up also. I used 2 cups UNCOOKED macaroni (3+ cups cooked), frozen peas, 2 cans soup, 2 cans tuna (he requested 3 next time) and 1.5 cups of cheese. This made enough for 2 big meals for 2 big eaters. (Oink) I did put a bit of water on it before I microwaved it as a leftover meal.

Thanks for this easy and yummy receipe!

Great recipe.  Had not made Tuna Casserole in years.  My husband loved it.  Made in a stoneware dish.  Doubled recipe and added 1 cup cooked peas.  Very good.

This recipe is five star to me because it is not only great tasting, but because it is something very simple to make when you really don't feel like cooking!

It is delicious!  I made it with 7 cups of macaroni, 2 cans of tuna added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and one can of mushroom soup.  I didn’t have fried onions, so I crumbled potato chips on top instead.  Mmmmmmm

This is a great recipe.  I did add two cans of cream of mushroom 1/2 cup of milk sharp cheddar cheese in the mixture as well as on top and peas.  II also only had short macaroni  noodles but they work out fine.  Family loved it.  The French fried onions really gave it nice texture!

Based on other reviews, I used 2 cans of tuna & 2 cans of soup.  I didn't have any French fried onion rings so I used crushed potato chips.  

It was very good, however, I will have to add milk when I re-heat it because it was still a bit dry, even though I baked it for the time specified.

Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this casserole!  The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup of milk.  It was still on the dry side, but that's what I loved about it.  I like my mac and cheese on the dry side too.  I used bow-tie macaroni and medium cheddar cheese.  The onion topping gave it just the right tasty crunchy finish.   It was excellent reheated too.
I definitely will make this one again.

Pretty good base receipe.  I made exactly as written the first time.  Plan to heed other's advice and make some additions next time as it needed more flavor and moisture.

The flavor combinations in this are five stars.  However, I see why many others made changes; it is very dry.  I say make as is with the addition of 1 cup milk, or a second can of soup.  Either one will make this a five star dinner.

This dish was good to make for someone who doesn’t like to cook. Very easy to make and very delicious! Since I didn’t have macaroni, I ended up using penne pasta and the dish came out just fine.

Made as is but with cream of celery soup since I didn't have cream of chicken.  I used egg noodles.  I also added a small can of mushrooms.  This is a keeper!

As written it only makes enough for a thin layer in a 9X13 pan. Once I added the tuna to the pasta and saw the ratio of tuna to pasta I added another can of tune. Unfortunately I didn't have a second can of soup to add. I will for next time. It wasn't bad as written but I think will be improved with doubling the tuna and soup from as written.

This is a great recipe - I have made it before and will make it again. Always make it slightly different based on what I have in my kitchen cabinets and fridge. Usually double for four with two growing kids and the dish is empty! Thank you!

Add or subtract anything you please. Modify it or not. Add stuff that will go bad if you don't or additional spices. It's good regardless.

As is, it was pretty good if a bit bland. Next time, for personal taste,  I'll be making some modifications such as adding some peas, some sour cream, etc. I do have to say though, there is no way on earth this amount is going to fill a 9x13 pan or feed 8 people. Divvying up one can of tuna, soup and just 3 cups of macaroni would be skimpy servings for just 4 good eaters unless you add salad and a couple of side dishes to boot.

The only changes I made were I'm celiac so I used gluten free macaroni and I made a creamy sauce with gluten free flour, almond milk and butter then added fresh mushrooms.  Yes this could be called a new recipe but I think it's just a gluten free version.

For the ones who totally change the recipe should submit it as their own. That way it's not so insulting to the person who originally submitted it.

I am not crazy about tuna casserole so I don't know why I made this but I am so glad that I did.  It is excellent.  After making it , but before baking, I tasted and decided to add another can of tuna, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, frozen peas, 2 T mayo, 2 dashes of Tabasco sauce, and some garlic and onion powder.   It is definitely a comfort food.

I made the recipe as written without any changes. It was very good! It was a very simple meal to throw together. Would be perfect for a week night meal. My husband and children all said that next time they would like me to add some more tuna in it. But overall it was delicious!

Delicious! My family loved it. It's the new tuna favorite.  I made the recipe as written.  The only change I made was to add a dash of garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder to the soup before I mixed it in. This was quick, easy, and used pantry items.

This is a very good tuna casserole! I don't like tuna, and I loved it, but my husband says it's missing something.
  I doubled the recipe, and added a cup of milk, then looked at the recipe, and saw it didn't call for any milk. It still came out great. When I make it again, I will probably add more tuna, and maybe some peas, just to please the hubby!  
 I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because of my hubby's comment, it's just the two of us, so any recipe has to please BOTH of us. 
(If I was making it for my daughter, and granddaughter, it would get 10 stars!!!)

Doubled the tuna amount and added a little light cream, but should have added a bit more as the casserole was good, but would be better if more moist

This dish was good. I added peas and carrots to it to get some veggies in the mix.  I also like it a little bit creamier so I added another can of soup but it was cream of celery and another can of tuna.  Bang! It all came together very quickly and nicely:)

Add peas! And be sure to use only the three cups of macaroni - don't make the mistake of putting in the whole box's worth like I did the first time.

Loved it! The first time I made it I added 16oz of  fresh mushrooms, a can of corn, and some fresh spinach to make it a little healthy. I don't know why it would need a 9x13 without all the veggies. The second time I used 2 cans of tuna, 6oz of egg noodles, added a bag of medley veggies, and half the amount of fried onions it called for. Excellent once again! That time I put it in a 2qt baking dish and it fit nicely.

Made as written. I used an 8x8 baking dish because it barely covered the bottom of the 9x13.  Next time I would like to add peas and onions.

When my 2 kids were young and I was a working single mom this was a weekly meal.  I didn't use the cheese and onions but the kids loved it and it was quick and easy.  I'm going to try it again with the cheese and onions that sounds really delish.  I'll try it on my grand kids.

This was really good. The kids and I really enjoyed it. I added peas and chopped mushrooms for more vegetables, but otherwise I stuck with the recipe as written. The biggest gripe I have? There's no way this feeds 8. One adult and two little children almost finished it off for lunch today. It also was not nearly enough for a 9x13 dish. It fit comfortably into a brownie pan. The only thing I can think of was that I didn't use enough noodles? I used 1.5 cups dry, as another reviewer suggested. Next time I will double the recipe, but this is definitely a keeper!

Delicious. I used a whole box of pasta, added more tuna and an extra can of soup and more of the onions and cheese. We are a family of 4 adults. I think the only thing I am going to change is add some milk to the soup. It was a little dry. Possibly because I didn't get the measurements right since I increased the recipe.  This is also very easy.

Simple. Tastes good. My wife hates cooked tuna...she had two bowls with tabasco. (She uses that stuff like it's going out of style)

 Yeah, I'll play with it next time, peas sound good, or adding some flavors. It's better than what I remember Mom making 30 years ago.

Only giving it 4 stars because the recipe is good but needs tweaking.  I made it as it was written but it was dry & did not make enough to constitute using a 13 X 9 baking dish; would have been better in an 8 X 8.  That being said I will make this again changing the following ..... Use at least 1/2 milk to make it creamy and not so dry & use a smaller baking dish.  I also use tuna filet so 1 4.5 oz can was sufficient.  Thanks!

My son who's in college showed up unexpectedly last night with his buddy & both their girlfriends.  Whipped this up in a pinch....the entire thing disappeared in SECONDS!! All 3 times I've made it, I've added a can of tuna, a can of mushroom soup,1/2c milk & a TBS dry mustard. I've used different types of pasta each time, whatever's at hand. All turned out great. Thank You Lindsey & Lindsey's Roomate!!!!!

Very Good.  Recipe says feeds 8, really only feeds 4.  I made it with egg noodles instead of macaroni.  I put on broil for a couple of minutes after I added onions...watch carefully so onions don't burn.

First of all, because of dietary restrictions, I "tweak" most recipes.  This one was no exception. It's a good basic tuna casserole recipe.

Thank you for the wonderful idea of using French onion!  I used French's cheddar style. Great! I also need to use up some cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. I thought I might of had too much garlic and decided to use only half the soup. I added the extra can of tuna, peas, half a cup of milk, and mixed shredded cheese.  Thanks to everyone who shares their ideas!

I made one change.. I used two cans of tuna. I liked it better than I thought I would when I saw it. And it's exactly what the name says.. it's easy. My 6 year old granddaughter did most of the assembling, including grating the cheese (and nibbling a little of it).

This was just ok for us.  I made most of the changes per the reviews and it was still just ok. But I have to say that I always love reading some of the reviews first , then making the dish and then posting my own findings.  Love that about Allrecipes!  Also I would be flattered if I submitted a recipe that's received nearly 1,000 reviews regardless!

BEST tuna casserole I have found!  Nice and creamy, great as written although I did change the serving size since it's just me and the dog.  The addition of those fried onions took it over the top for me.  Thanks to the original person who posted the recipe.  I'll be having it for lunch tomorrow and am already looking forward to it.

Thank you Chgofoodiegal. You said what I've wanted to say for years! People..if you're going to alter a recipe beyond recognition you're being disrespectful to the original cook. Don't like it as is, move on. Thanks Lmcdevit. Your recipe rocked.

This really is a great recipe. I doubled it, mixed the cheese in it. For topping I used 1 sleeve crushed Ritz crackers with melted butter and sprinked paprika over and bake at least 45 min
Delish!

This was good, very simple. I used vegetable broth, mayo and cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. (Only because I didn't have any on hand and we're trying to eat vegetarian)

By my calculation, the serving size is not much more than 1/2 cup of pasta and a little tuna. I had to make substitutes since I didnt end up having what I needed in my pantry, I substituted 1/2 cup alfredo sauce for the soup, only had two slices of cheese and added a hard bowled egg. I also only used a 9x9 pan and it fits perfectly.  My husband and I will split it for dinner. I figured that a tuna sandwich usually uses about a half a can of tuna so that works out fine and a serving of alfredo sauce is 1/4 cup. I havent tasted it but it will be fine, I am sure.

I made this recipe exactly as written. When it was done, I thought it looked a little dry, but it tasted delicious and the whole family loved it even though they grumbled about having to eat  "tuna casserole"  I noticed they went back for seconds and thirds. I served with peas on the side. 
Tastes really good !

This is a very good basic recipe! I do agree that substituting ingredients is rather silly to rate, but additions should be understandable. We have unique tastes that we are used to growing up. For instance, I am Indonesian and am used to lots of spices! So I HAVE to add stuff to make it extremely flavorful for my family's taste buds. The recipe as is IS fine but to me, I will rather add stuff for my liking rather than feeling like I wasted ingredients because it's just "fine". I added mayo, sour cream, milk, and garlic powder like the other reviewers. But again, very good recipe to start. My husband and kids loved it which is amazing to me because it's tuna!

Love this recipe -- added a bit of mayo and sour cream and 2 cans of tuna.  There is no way it serves 8, 4 is more like it.  Also, no way it works in a 9x12 dish -- definitely an 8x8.  Two and 1/2 cups of dried pasta ends up being 3 cups of cooked.

Too bad that milk, of some kind, was not included in the ingredient list.  This was not creamy at all, but was as dry as anything I've ever tasted.  There are too many other good tuna casseroles to prepare rather than try to doctor this one up.

This is the first recipe I've written a review on. This was very good. I used what I had on hand. I didn't have macaroni so I used whole grain rotini pasta, a large can of tuna and Colby Monterey cheese instead of cheddar. Some extras I added were black pepper and green peas. Very good, my husband and I loved it! :)

A tasty twist to this -substitute the french fried onions with crushed potato chips.  Not nearly as 'healthy' but the salty crunch goes well with the other flavors.

This recipe is great for college students, it is easy and inexpensive. I added frozen veggies because I was moving out the next week and needed to get rid of the stuff in the freezer. It was really good with and without the veggies. Its a great simple recipe :)

I made this dish tonight for me and my boyfriend and was absolutely delicious.  Thank you for a quick and easy, belly-filling meal. I also have enough leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.

This was a good and easy recipe.  I added another can of albacore tuna and used cream of mushroom soup.

Perfectly wonderful, kids love it, so do busy Moms n Dads.
I love trying different cheeses like smoked Gouda or jalapeno jack cheese. Your family might not like the crunch y onions, change the topper if you have leftover ranch or bbq chips. Thank you LMCDEVIT

I made a half a batch of this for my DH and DS – they love hot tuna casserole.  I made it as written, but did add some green beans to get another vegetable in.  They ate the entire pan one sitting, and said “this is good; you can make it again sometime.”  I served this with a salad and rolls.  If a quick and simple recipe is what you are looking for, then look no further.

This tuna casserole was awesome. We did not change a thing. My husband even liked it and he doesn't really care for tuna casserole. My 10 year old step-daughter made this. This was her first cooking lesson and she was so happy that this turned out very good. Thanks for the recipe. It is a keeper.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! Perfect comfort food. I followed the instructions on the can of soup (I used mushroom because I'm a vegetarian) and added 1 canful of water, which made the casserole a little messier/less solid. Will definitely make again.

okay, I have no desire to get into this bit about doctering a recipe and then reviewing it.....I do feel  many of us find the basic recipe and change it up somewhat to suit our own tastes....which is what I did with this one. I love tuna casserole (a good one) but I like it very creamy. I used 1 and 1/4 cups macaroni (uncooked) I did not measure after i cooked it to see what it equaled. I didnt have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of celery (1 and 1/2 cans) I sauted some diced onions and a little garlic and threwthat in the mix. 2 cans of tuna and someone mentions some mayo so I added a heavy tablespoon of that too!! A little extra cheese in the mix too (velveeta) and the cheddar on top! Very Very good!!! also I recommend using a round baking dish instead of rectangle (it keeps all casseroles more moist) Over all I was VERY impressed with the flavor being as easy as it was

Added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some garlic powder. But it still seemed a little dry. Otherwise, it was very tastey and will be a good base recipe to dress up. Thank you!

This was Awesome!  My husband and 3 year old both loved it!  The only changes I made were: I used egg noodles (that's all I had), added a little splash of milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Yummy!

I also add all of the extras from the reviews (extra tuna, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 c milk plus some hot) That's why I rated this recipe so low.

My family liked this- I was surprised as I don't usually make casseroles- I grew up on them, so they're not my favorite! I think it needed to be creamier and I'll adjust it next time.

The only thing I change is I add 2 c. frozen peas.  My whole family loves it they are very picky and can't even tell that it's tuna.  This is a wonderful recipe especially if you have young kids and want them to get some fish.  It is great leftover too!

Left out the French Fried Onions....don't like onions. I also mixed the cheese right into the noodle, tuna, and cream of chicken mix rather than just putting it on top. I also mixed in a little Mozzarella and an extra can of tuna. Turned out great!

I made this for dinner last night not realizing my boyfriend hates tuna noodle casserole. He cringed when I told him what I'd made for dinner. That being said, he ate it, and even went as far as to say it was the best tuna noodle casserole he'd every had. He really loved the topping, but he's still not a fan. I personally enjoyed it. I thought the cheese and the french fried onions were a fun and tasty addition. I won't be making this for my boyfriend and I again, but I'm definitely going to make it for my mom and I at some point. I did add about a half-can of milk, as other users suggested, and I used No Yolk noodles because that's what I had on hand. This also reheats in the microwave quite nicely.

This recipe is definitely a keeper, my whole family loved it.  I usually try recipes as they are written before I make changes, but I did a few little tweaks to this one as I went along.  I added a second can of tuna; after mixing it up it seemed like 1 wasn't enough (next time I might try two cans of soup as some other suggested).  I had some sharp cheddar cheese in the fridge so I did half sharp and half mild.  I did add frozen peas.

Great standby recipe and a good one for kids to help with.  I made this many times as a kid, but I used one package of wide egg noodles, 2 cans of tuna, 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can full of milk, cheese and frozen peas.

I agree - add a little milk (say 1/2 can) to add a bit more moisture.   Otherwise, it was great!

Tried last night for dinner.  It was good.  I added frozen peas to the recipe before I put in oven to bake.  I also added another can of tuna.  It smelled so yummy....My daughter didn't care for it too much.  She said because it had cheese.  I thought that was the best part.  It was a little on the dry side for me.  I'm sure it was because I added all of the extra ingredients.  With this in mind the only thing I will change is to add another can of cream of chicken to the mixture before baking.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for posting.

First time making tuna casserole. So quick and effortless and your right, its da bomb. Whole family loved it. I did the one can of mushroom and one can of chicken soup too. One spoonful of strong dijon mustard (didnt taste it) and one squirt of miracle whip (didnt need to do that either probably but got it from other reviews) It was so so delisch.

This is a good basic tuna casserole.  The French fried onions were the best part.

This wasnt' bad at all.  But it seemed to be lacking something.  my roommate LOVED it and I will probably make it again, but I might add a few things.

Pretty good! I made it like it says but since I couldn't find FF onions, I sauteed my own. And added peas. Next time I will add an extra can of tuna and more of the soup. This recipe gets added to the comfort food list. Thanks!

Its silly but on the 4th of July my friends had a barbeque and I had a feeling that everyone attending would just bring meat. Well I brought this and It was perfect. By the end of the night the casserole was gone, yet we still had an abundence of meat.

Really good (and easy!) tuna casserole. I used 2 cans of tuna for a little more 'oomph!' and added a little bit of milk to the soup mix the 2nd time I made it (the first time was a bit dry, I thought).  Family loves it!

This was not really that good.  You could barely taste the tuna with all the pasta.  I would at least recommend doubling the tuna.  Next it was a little better as a leftover, but then it was a little dry and extra greasy.

I wasn't all that crazy about it, but maybe it's because i used wheat noodles?  It was very fast and easy to make though.

I followed the receipe and it turned out good. I didnt give it 5 stars because my husband didnt go back for seconds. I think next time I will take the advice from another review and add either more soup or some sour cream.

Made this casserole for dinner tonight. My family loved the addition of cheese and french fried onions. I did use cream of mushroom soup, rather than cream of chicken. I also added sea salt,fresh ground pepper, garlic granules and basil..just because I'm a spice fanatic:) Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was just okay as is.  I added a lot of things to it in order to make it have any flavor.  I definitely would never make this recipe in its original form.  I gave it three stars only because it is a good base and a good recipe if you would like to add your own flair to the recipe.  I do not recommend this recipe unless you plan on taking the time to taste test multiple times and to add ingredients as you go.

This recipe WAS easy and delicious!!!!  The hubby and I really enjoyed this one.  I took the advice of others and added a bit of mayo and some half-and-half and it turned out great, wasn't dried or anything.  I can see myself making this over and over.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I usually make this in a square baking dish because I like to layer it. I also like a little vegi in mine, so I add a cup or so of peas or corn. I also prefer egg noodles to macaroni. My hubby likes more meat, so I add an additional can of tuna, he also loves the French fried onions, so I hide some by splitting the filling into 2 parts and put the FFO and some cheese in the middle. Excellent recipe! Very adaptable!  Thank you!

This was pretty good. We like a lot of cheese, so we used a pound of veleeta. Dad said it needed peas, but I despise them so yeah. :D

This is really, really good! I am making it for the second time tonight. I didn't have the onions so i used plain potato chips crushed up like my mama used to do and it was wonderful! Thank you!

I just got done eating this and had to jump on here to give my review. I loved this alot and my 5 year old who refuses to eat "shuna" at every single bite in his plate. I told him it was chicken and he didn't notice the difference. I will definatly be making this again. I ficed the recipe as it was written. Great job with this recipe.

I was impressed when my boyfriend went for a second helping of this casserole (first time ever, in my brief history of cooking), but when he went for a third? Just blown away. It's a breeze to make, and the ingredients are readily available at your local supermarket for Americans, at least. Since I first made this a few months ago, my boyfriend has been requesting it at least once a week. Oh, as a final note, I usually double the quantities in the recipe.

Ok this is so good! It reminds me of when my mom would make it when I was a little kid. I'm not a good cook, but this was so easy to make and it turned out really good! All beginning cooks should make this just add a little salt and pepper to it and you'll have an amazing Tuna Casserole!

I took the recommendations of others and used 2 cans tuna, but I thought that made it a bit fishy tasting. I sprinkled in a bit of garlic powder, mustard powder, cayenne pepper (not for heat but for flavor enhancement, it wasn't hot).  I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup based on other reviews. I liked it that way but I didn't try the original soup so I can't speak to that.   I also added 1/2 C whole milk and used half cheddar and half velveeta. I sprinkled some chopped fresh basil on top just for color.  We liked it, and I loved that it was so easy to make that I was able to prepare it whilst holding a fussy 4 month old!

My daughter will not eat tuna so I put chicken in it instead.  This is her absolute favorite dish now.  She requests this all the time for dinner, I have to make it twice a month.  We like it really cheesy, so we do add extra.  Wonderful dish! Thanks!

I have to admit that I added a can of soup and a can of tuna but I probably had more than 3 cups of pasta since I didn't really measure it (essentially doubled it).  Oh and I used chips instead of FF Onions.

I love this recipe. This is my "Don't want to cook" dinner. Perfect as is, but for my personal preference, I sautee garlic and onion, add frozen peas, and also add a little milk. As with any recipe, we all have different tastes. My seasoning includes salt, pepper and garlic powder (obviously I love garlic). The fried onion on top makes this recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter, even used 3 cups of uncooked macaroni noodles and my family loved it.  I did serve it with a dash of shredded parmesan cheese (not the dried stuff!) and it just added to the wonderful flavor.  My husband agreed that this recipe was way better than the tuna casserole I normally serve and my three children (ages 8 and 11) liked it too!

Good basic recipe. I made it exactly as written and enjoyed it, but agree that it does lend itself to some modifications with future preparations. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE: Made again, and w/ a couple of small changes, it was really comforting and delicious! Used closer to 3.5 cups noodles, added a half can of milk, and used tuna packed in oil (which I had bought by mistake). Baked in a 9x9 casserole dish rather than 9x13. Very creamy, crunchy and well-received by the whole family. KEEPER! Thanks

I made this recipe with a macaroni and cheese recipe with cheese soup. I ended up mixing them together and liked them much better together. So my only suggestion would be to add cheese soup and colby cheese. I liked the recipe by itself. I couldn't find the fried onions, though. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very delicious and quick and easy to make. As main dish it turned out to be only two big portions though. I followed the tip of another reviewer and added a cup of sweet peas and 2 cups of milk. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was good.  As others suggested, I added another can of tuna, and mushroom soup instead of chicken.  I also added milk, but will omit that next time, it was too liquidy.  I also added salt and pepper before baking for extra flavor.  Delicious!

The recipe definately needs milk or 1/2 and 1/2 or it will turn out dry. I added about 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2, 2 tsp minced garlic, salt and pepper and topped with parmesan cheese. Cooked covered for 35 min. It was perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

i try not to change much in recipes without trying them first. i made this as stated, and i wish i would have altered it a lot. my family and i thought it was dry and bland. now i can see why so many people changed this up so much. its an ok start to an easy tuna casserole, so i might read through the reviews and try again. oh and if you make this as stated use an 8x8 or smaller casserole dish because a 9x13 is way too big. it barely covered the bottom, so i had to dirty up another dish.

I changed this recipe a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used Cream of Mushroom soup and 1 can of Cheddar Cheese soup, I also added the French Fried Onions into the casserole as well as on top.  My husband even like this casserole and he doesn't like tuna!

was pleasantly suprised.  will take the place of my tuna casserole that i used to make.  followed the recipe exactly.  i did not think that it was "too" dry like other reviewers stated but could have been a little bit more moist.  an extra can of soup would have been too much. so next time i would maybe either add some milk or try baking in a smaller pan??  thanks for the post!!

I wish I could give this one 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the best tuna casserole I've ever had; loved the french fried onions and cheese.  Most importantly, my family loved it too.

I used two cans of 5 ounce white tuna, along with a cup of skim milk. It takes at least two cups of dry macaroni to make three cups of cooked macaroni.  We thought it was great!

This is a great tuna casserole recipe.  I used a 12 oz. can of tuna, just because I like it meatier.  The fried onions on top is what makes this meal!!  No more Tuna Helper for our family.  Thanks for a great recipe idea!

Good start, but needs more. I added a can of mushrooms, a can of peas, 2 stalks celery chopped, 1/2 milk, and plenty of hot sauce and old bay seasoning. Comforting and easy. Next time will add green onion on top to serve.

Thanks so much for such a great recipe! I've made this a few times now, it's become a household staple.
I love that you can use whatever creamy soup you have on hand! And it's fast!
It's very adaptable if you want to add ingredients (other reviewers), but I tend to just stick to it and add the extra tuna and soup, it's just so good! Thanks so much!

I normally don't eat tuna but my husband loves it. So I tried this recipe, and I actually, well love it! I even went back for seconds it was so good. I of course used tons of cheese. But I'm so glad I found and tried this recipe it was well worth it!

I love this recipe. I make it with wide egg noodles, and 1 can of low sodium Cream of Chicken Soup, plus 1 can of low sodium Cream of Mushroom soup to give it a yummy, creamy flavor. Delicious!

Wow, this was super easy. I added a little bit of salt and pepper and used the "cooking" cream of chicken soup to save on fat and calories. This had terrific flavor and the fried onions were perfect. A family pleaser here!

I like mine to have more texture and nutrition. I use an entire bag of noodles, and a full bag of MIXED VEGTABLES. Also b/c I use more noodles, I add more cream soup (Chicken or mushroom-whatever I have on hand). Tuna Casseroles is one of my families favorite recipies!

This is the way I have made Tuna Casserole forever, it's delicious.  I use cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken, add about 1/2 cup milk, and a couple dashes of garlic powder.  I also put about half of the french fried onions into the casserole, along with all of the cheese, and then the rest of the onions on top.  Yummy!

family loved it - doubled up the recipe and accidently forgot to put a third of the noodles in and what a mistake it was it came out perfect not to creamy and not to dry, even with doubling up there were no leftovers.

This was a great, fast EASY recipe.  I will be making it often!  Even my toddler loved it.  
FYI, as another reviewer mentioned,  1 1/2 cups dry pasta makes about 3 cups cooked.  I did make some modifications based on previous comments: I added 1/2 cup peas, 3/4 cup milk, an extra can of tuna and a  dash of pepper & pepper seasoning.  Personally I thought the cream of chicken soup was an excellent change for this classic comfort food dish.

The thought of Tuna Casserole made me shiver from a bad experience with a poorly made casserole from years ago. I bucked up and thought I would try this one since it was raved about so much. SUPER!!!  I can see this becoming a favourite on a cold day. I followed the recipe pretty much, just added some peas I had left over in the fridge. My picky daughter even ate it!

This is a good basic recipe. But you cant make tuna casserole without some frozen peas, and cream of chicken??? not with tuna it has to be cream of mushroom or celery. You can allways be creative with the toppings though, I have used crunched up potato chips even bbq flavor is good,I have even used funions, 1\2 cup of mayo makes it extra creamy if you like that too.. tuna casserole is so good because you can make it your own so easy or you can make it different everytime.

This does sound yummy, however, when I make it I add chopped up green olives.  We love the added saltiness!  Peas sound good too.

I made this recipe last night, but I had to add a little to make a bigger dish: 2 cans tuna, can of cream of mushroom soup & 1/2 c milk.  Overall recipe was good, but I think next time, I will substitute the tuna with turkey or ham, just for a different twist.

I just love this recipe.. have made it many times with whatever cream of soup I have on hand and throw anything else in I might want to add, including seasonings; the kids love it, too! thanks.. thought it about time I sent a review. Five stars due to ease of preparation and very low cost feeding a family of 5.

YUM!!! I did not alter this recipe at all, but I did use the thicker homestyle egg noodles from the freezer section, as I think they make way better casseroles than the dry kind in the pasta section.

So good my mother-in-law asked for a copy!  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 c. mayo, and used a whole (8 oz) bag of shredded cheese to the recipe.  The Durkee onions sprinkled on top are a really flavorful touch.  Everyone loved it - I'll definitely make it again!

I cooked up about 1-3/4 cups of dry macaroni and mixed in 2 cans of tuna, 1 can cream of celery soup, around ½ cup of mozzarella, and about ½ soup can of milk. I seasoned it with some freshly-ground pepper and garlic powder, and I topped it with around 1 cup of the French fried onions. I put it in a 8"x8" glass pan. Good and quick, thanks for sharing, LMcDevit!

Really great recipe! A staple for sure at my house. It's evolved to "change it up a bit". Things I've added are celery, broccoli,spinach, water chestnuts for crunch, sour cream for a little more creaminess, and garlic pepper, whatever suits our mood at the time!

I love this tuna casserole.  I added a little bit of Velveeta before sprinkling on the shredded chesses because we love chesse, and used Rigatoni noodles because they are good bite size noodles.  We will be eating this frequently!

My husband made a face when I told him I was making this... and then ended up getting several helpings! Absolutely delish! I added some frozen peas (threw them in with the pasta when they were almost finished cooking) YUMMMMMm.... I'm ready to make it again!

This has become one of my husband's favorite comfort food dishes.  I usually use 1 can Cream of Chicken soup and 1 can Cream of Celery soup. I always throw in a veggie, like peas/carrots, or whatever else I might have in the fridge or freezer. It always turns out PERFECT.  You really can't go wrong - it's quick, easy, and tasty!!!

Added 2 cans tuna, used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, and added 1 can (5oz) condensed milk. Turned out great and was yummy as leftovers!

This was maybe too easy.  It needed a few changes.  I added 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1/2 can milk, and 1/2 cup velveeta, garlic powder, pepper, and I used wide egg noodles.  I topped it with what I had, 5 cheese Italian shreaded cheese.  It came out moist and good.

this is great, but i made a few changes to resemble what i used to have when i was little.  I used two boxes of kraft, prepared as box says.  Then i added two reg size cans of tuna (drained), and two cans cream of mushroon.  I did not add extra cheese.  I then baked as directed and then right out of the oven I crumbled reg lays patatoe chips on top.  You have to use patatoe chips...way way better then fried onions.

We're about to move, so I have been looking for ways to get rid of all of our canned goods.  I slightly modified this recipe to great success by morphing it with the Cambell's Soup Macaroni and cheese recipe as follows:  Used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, rather than cream of chicken, one soup can of milk,  24 oz of tuna, cheddar french fried onion rings and 3 cups of whole wheat pasta, cooked.  It was, as my husband said, "good, fast & easy comfort food."

This is a very good old standard recipe.
You can jazz it up a tad by adding some hot sauce or Everglades Seasoning.

I'd never had tuna casserole before.  Not anything gourmet, but it tasted fine.  My husband said it was good, and he grew up eating tuna casserole.  My four year old liked it too.  I used freshly fried red onions, which was my favorite part.  I made it in a 11x13 pan which was a better fit.  I think it could use a second can of tuna, too.

I liked this.  The onions gave it a strong flavor.  It was very dry, though, and the 9x13 baking dish was way too large.  It was very easy to make - it took less than 10 minutes prep time.

I tried this recipe using the tips others suggested and agreed with one reviewer who thought it was too much tuna.  I am one who prefers tuna in low dosages so next time I will use 9 oz. vesus 12 and blend the cheese with the mixture.  I would also use egg noodles, for some reason macaroni doesn't go with tuna casserole.

O my goodness this is great.  I used an extra can of tuna and soup and stirred some of the onions into the casserole and then some more on top.  I think the onions really make this casserole extra good. I'm not really big into tuna but I could eat this every night.

My picky kids LOVED this!  I substituted rotini pasta for the macaroni and added a 2nd can of tuna.  Also added some garlic and onion powder and a little paprika to give it some spice.  I sliced Velveeta and layered on the top for the last couple of minutes before I added the french fried onions.  I then stuck it under the broiler for 1 minute.

Really enjoyed this simple dish.  My boyfriend loved it and wants me to make it again.  I didn't think it was overly dry, but I did add another can of tuna otherwise it would have not been as good.  Definately will make again.

This dish was inhaled by my family.  I also made a few changes that others have suggested.  I doubled the recipe, added a can of carrots and peas and 1/2 cup of milk.  It was so simple to make and had a great flavor.  This one will join my casserole rotation.

Only thing I added to this was a 1/2 can of peas.  Very good.  It made more than enough for after cooking it, I found out my husband and my daughter doesn't like Tuna casserole.  Will make for friends and family though, it was quite good.

Not bad! Tastes better than it sounds. I did have to add some milk to the dish during baking, otherwise it would have been too dry. If you like Tuna, you may want to add an extra can. I may use other's suggestions for keeping it from being so dry. Will be making again though. My husband enjoyed it, and it was sooo easy to make! Thanks

I agree with most of the other recommendations to enhance the flavor of the casserole.  I also added 1/2 a can of Rotell and more cheese.  Salt is a must add in this dish.  It has much potential, and the original recipe is the ground structure to build apon.

This recipe was good, my husband liked it. I did what other reviewers suggested and added an extra can of tuna, 1 can of cream of mushroom, half a soup can of milk and a can of peas and pipette pasta because that was what we had in the cupboard. I forgot to put in the mayo, though, so I'm not sure if it could have made the dish a bit better. I found that after it had all cooked it was lacking in seasoning so I had to add more pepper and some salt and a bit of dill weed. Over all this was a good recipe to make.

This is a great base recipe. Its very easy to adjust to your taste, or whatever ingredients you have on hand. I actually used Tuna Melt Tuna Helper, and I used two 7 ounce pouches of tuna, and then added Cream of Mushroom soup, 3/4 of a can of milk, threw in some sauteed mushrooms and onions, peas, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some crushed red pepper flakes. I topped it with cracker crumbs and cheddar cheese. My husband loved it, and he is extremely picky, so that was all I needed to know that I'll be using this recipe as a guideline again.

Used two cans of tuna, a can of cream of chicken, a can of cream of mushroom, and I also added garlic powder and juice and zest from half a lemon.   I'm pretty sure I used more cheese and french fried onions than called for.   Very good, although I think I'll just use two cans of cream of mushroom next time and leave out the cream of chicken.

I thought this was a good casserole as a staple that you can use on a budget and quick and easy.  What I did differently was mixed extra cheese into the noodle/tuna mixture for extra cheesiness.  I also like more of a "well-rounded" casserole, so I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained) that had peppers and onions in it and also mixed in uncooked fresh spinach.  I did use two cans of tuna just to get more meat into the dish.  But it turned out really good with the added cheese, tomatoes and spinach.  My picky husband even noted how good it was even though it deviated from the typical tuna casserole.

This would have gotten 5 stars, but it is a tuna noddle casserole...I'm just not sure it will ever qualify as "the best"!  But, it was really good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some seasonings, used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, a 1/2 soup can of milk, and another can of tuna fish.  I was hungry and it was tasty!  The 2 1/2 year old started eating it by himself (wow!), and then gave up after a couple of bites.  I'm not sure if he just didn't like it or he was just distracted.  I'll make this again when I'm short on time! Thanks!

Loved this recipe! My eight year old made it for his Wolf den patch, which of course made it taste even better. We also added a second can of tuna, 1/2 can of milk, peas, some salt and garlic powder. Easy and yummy!

This was a great easy recipe! I made a few adjustments to the recipe... I added garlic salt, doubled the tuna, added a soup can of milk, a can of peas and used moneray jack cheese and my boys loved it! I also topped the whole thing with bread crumbs. It was yummy and a new favorite!

This was good and easy! I too doubled the tuna, used two cans of cream of mushroom and about half a cup of milk. I also threw in one cup of frozen mixed veggies as I try to sneak veggies in wherever possible. This version of tuna casserole will be used over and over in my home. Thanks!

I wasn't overly impressed with this.  I didn't think it tasted very tuna-y at all and I prefer my casseroles to be creamier which this was not.  The French Fried onions added a nice touch though and I also added some mixed veggies but I think I'll stick with my own recipe for now.  It was very quick to throw togeher which was a plus.

Excellent tuna casserole.  I also added one can of cream of celery soup as well as a half of a soup can of milk. I added a touch of onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  My husband even had double helpings of this...and he normally never likes casseroles!

I'M NOT A TUNA LOVER, EXCEPT IN A SANDWICH, BUT I USED TO MAKE TUNA CASSEROLE WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNG. THIS RECIPE IS GOOD, BUT IT IS EVEN BETTER WITH CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. I USED FLAT NOODLES AND THREW IN A HANDFUL OF FROZEN PEAS AND MINCED ONION..
 SOMETIMES I TOPPED IT WITH CRUSHED POTATO CHIPS. WITH TUNA CASSEROLE, THE VARIATIONS ARE ENDLESS.

This recipe served as a great base as I made a few changes.  I used a full bag of egg noodles instead of the macaroni, two cans off tuna, and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I also added an additional cup of cheddar cheese, frozen peas, and fresh mushrooms.  I topped it all off with French Fried Cheddar onions and even mixed some in the pot with the other ingredients.  I have passed this recipe on and have gotten rave reviews.

This was wonderful! Even my picky husband liked it! I took advice from other reviewers and added 2 cans of soup(cream of mush, cream of chix), frozen peas, and an extra can of tuna. My hubby even thought it could use another can of soup! I thought 2 was fine. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The perfect tuna noodle! Though I do like to blend an extra cup of cheese into the noodle mixture along with the cup on top to make it cheesier.

I do not like canned tuna, but I really, really liked this dish!  Added one can of cream of celery and 1/2 can of milk along with cream of chicken.  Also added fresh chopped onions, an extra can of tuna and canned peas (drained) before baking.  Husband, toddler and I loved; pre-schooler wouldn't touch it!  Made enough for two meals.

I used a full 16 oz. box of macaroni, added a can of milk as was suggested, and left off the fried onions. Instead, I added dehydrated onions and a box of chicken stuffing to the mix. I put the cheese directly in the sauce, and did a little additional sprinkling on top. This was really easy, and I will make it again, especially since it's one of my 15 month old's favorite meals.

Icalled my man friend at work and said well I have made the dreaded tuna fish casserole.  He said I hate tuna fish casserole but I will try it.  I said there is frozen pizza just in case.  He went for seconds and took left overs to work. I took advice of others put two cans of soup one celery one chicken, used wide egg noodles, a little milk, salt and pepper, a can of green peas  and two cans of tuna fish.  Made a huge pan.  Enjoyed myself!!!

I'm not much of a tuna casserole person - but my husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I thought it was pretty good, too.  I added frozen broccoli florets, took others' advice and went with an extra can of soup (one celery, one mushroom).  I also put one cup of cheese and one cup of onions in the casserole - and then baked another cup of each on top.  It really was very good - and very, very easy.

This is exactly what tuna casserole should be - EASY & DELICIOUS.  I make mine with whole wheat pasta (like the tan box of Heartland)and you can't even tell a difference.  If this is all you intend to serve at meal time, this recipe is 2 PERFECT ADULT SERVINGS.

This was a very good recipe!  I did make some changes, but I don't think that they made a huge difference.  I used cream of mushroom soup, added a little milk, and a dash of garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Also, I added a small amount of the fried onions into the mixture.  Then after approx. 20 minutes, I added another one cup cheddar cheese to the top to melt along with the recommended amount of fried onions...YUMMY!  Definately a favorite for this Pregnant Mommy!

This was a great base for tuna casserole...I used egg noodles, 2 cans of cream soup (one celery, one chicken), used 2 cans of tuna (my husband said it could use 1 more even), 2 cups of cheddar cheese and added about a cup of frozen peas.  It was very good and creamy!  Even warmed up the next day!

Recipe was delicious and easy.  Followed others comments and added a soup can of milk and mixed the cheese into the sauce instead of on top.  Turned out great!  Don't leave the onions out.  They add a great crunch.

"Tuna Casserole"... doesn't sound too appealing to me, but I remember having it as a kid and liking it. I had all the ingredients at home so I decided to make it.  When my boyfriend asked me what was for dinner he made a discusted face when i told him.  I was a bit skeptical but.... it turned out AWESOME!  My bf even wanted to take the leftovers to work the next day to eat for lunch!  I did add a little milk and more tuna. mmmmm! Easy and fast clean up too.

My husband and I both were suprised at how good this was! It was so much better than my usual tuna noodle casserole. My 6 yeaar old daughter didn't like the fried onions, so next time, I will leave them off part of the dish for her.  After reading other reviews, I did make some changes.  I seasoned the dish with salt and pepper, used 12 ounces of noodles instead of the macaroni and cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  It was super!  I will be making this one again!  Thank you for submitting this great recipe!

This was pretty good...better than what my wife usually makes, although a little dry.
Used 2 cans tuna, 2 cans soup, 1 can milk.  Maybe a cup of dour cream would moisten it up a little more.  We'll tinker with it until it's good.

The recipe was easy to do!  I changed it a little and used cream of mushroom and Velveeta cheese.  It turned out great for a quick meal with a salad.  I plan to make this recipe again!

I thought this recipe had a really good base. I used @ 6 c of egg noodles, added 1 large can tuna, 2 cans of the chicken soup and added about 3/4 can milk to give it more consistency. Then mixed in some cheese, and season w/salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Try adding some canned mushrooms and frozen peas. Then top with cheese and French Fried onions. It was sooo awesome!

Good tuna casserole recipe. I used, pasta shells, 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 2 cans of tuna and made a microwave melted cheese sauce of about 1/3lb. Velveeta - cubed, butter (margarine) and the cheddar to mix in with the soup and pasta before spreading in the casserole. I like to dot all my casseroles with more margarine. I mixed some French fried onion rings into the casserole as well as putting them on top. Those are great and seem to perk up any casserole however I’ve made tuna casseroles with crushed potato chip topping and I really like that too. Potato chips are cheaper than those onion rings too. It was easy, I even microwaved the casserole to bake it.

This was a very good recipe. My 15-month old enjoyed the noodles, and my husband and I enjoyed it overall. Very easy.

I modified the recipe by 1) using egg noodles, 2) adding green beans, 3) using sauteed onions instead of dried, 4) increased the amount of tuna.

I will definitely make this dish again.

Good flavor - kind of dry. As per other reviews, I added two cans of soup but it wasn't enough. I think maybe some milk or cream or chicken broth might have made it a little more soupy. I also added another can of tuna which I would do again. I also put crushed butter crackers on top as I didn't have the french fried onions. If I ever do tuna casserole again, I'll make this one.

This recipe was a good basic starting point for a good tuna casserole.  If you like customizing recipies you'll like this one.  If you like flavorful recipies you'll have to add alot to this one.  I added garlic powder, and some other random seasonings I found in my aunts cupboards.  It turned out kind of bland still, IMHO, but my husband gobbled it up.  So Who Knows?

Fabulous! My husband has been asking me to make a tuna noodle casserole, and this recipe was definitely a hit.  I used 2 cans of tuna (may use 3 next time) and 2 cans of the soup.  Great as leftovers too!

This recipe is a good base recipe as stated. I doubled the noodles and subbed in a can of Progresso cheese soup and fried some bacon to add and used the two cans of tuna everyone else said it needed and YUM. Thanks for sharing!

This was super tasty and easy to prepare. I added cream of mushroom, extra tuna, a little extra cheese and sauted diced onions...excellent. I will be making this again!
Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy, easy, easy.  I keep the ingredients in case I need to make a quick meal.  Better than most tuna casseroles!

i have never made tuna casserole, but i thought this was great.  i did change it a little.  i added 2 cans of tuna, a little bit of milk and a can of peas.  i also cruched some crackers over the top and it turned out great.  we had a lot left over because it's only 2 of us, but i will definatly make it again.

Awesome! Even without the french fried onions, (not exactly sure what they are) it tasted great! I followed other reviewers suggestions and added two cans of tuna and a little milk.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It certainly was easy, but the flavour was a bit off.  I preferred it on the serving day, the leftovers weren't spectacular.

I thought this was out of this world! I added peas to it and used Mushroom soup instead of chick, so, so, so yummy! It was very easy to throw together after a busy day and we have a ton of left overs. This was an all around yummy meal!

This is a great tuna casserole recipe. The french fried onions give this recipe a crunchy, zesty kick. I will start using this tuna recipe instead of my old one. Definatly a quick dinner and I had all the ingredients on hand. Great for those evenings when you have nothing planned ahead of time.

LOVED IT! I also used 2 cups of uncooked noodles with a large can of tuna and one can each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. I also added lots of yummy peas! My husband rated a nine for a tuna casserole. A ten from me. DELICIOUS.

This was so easy and a huge hit at our house!  I added an extra can of tuna and soup and some peas, as was suggested.  Very creamy.  The onions really added a great flavor.  I will be making this again.

The fried onions add an excellent zip to this recipe--not like your average tuna casserole at all! I like to add a can of peas to the mix and it makes a full course meal all in one dish. Great recipe--everyone at my house loves it!!

I was needing something new to make and was going through the recipes.  I came across this one and was glad that I did.  Very easy to make and tasty.  I doubled the recipe and added garlic for taste.  My family enjoyed having something different.

Really great recipe.  My future son in law was here to I had to make it go a little further.  I used two cans of soup (one cream of mushroom, one cream of chicken) instead of one can of soup and I used two cups of uncooked noodles (made a little over 3 cups, and two cans of albacore tuna.
My daughter is a very picky eater and she went back for seconds.

Thank you so much. GREAT RECIPE.

P.S.  I used just a touch more cheese (Colby and Monterey Jack) also.

Talk about quick and easy. It tasted awesome too. I love tuna. I might put a little more tuna next time. My girlfriend didn't want to try it because she doesn't like tuna, but I'm sure it would taste good with chicken too.

We loved this recipe! It is now a bi-weekly tradition and has impressed both family and guests. We substituted pizza cheese for cheddar, and used 2 cans of cream of chicken, but the simplicity and taste is just great!

This is great! The second time I made it I used a can of salmon and it was even better. It gave it a great flavor.

This recipe was average, not much flavor to it. I probably won't make it as-is again.

This recipe was great!  My husband even liked it.  He's hard to please.  I doubled the soup and the tuna though, it made it more creamy.  The fried onions were a great touch.

I didn't particularly like this recipe. It was bland and boring. I didn't really care for the hot tuna. Next time I'm in the mood for tuna casserole I will use my own recipe that I made up. Make a box of macaroni and cheese with milk and butter. Add a can of flaked tuna and a small can of sweet peas. It's good hot or cold.

This is one of the best tuna casseroles i've ever had!!! It is really good as leftovers and it took me no time to make it. The ingredients are simple and there's no need to run out and buy ten different things that you will never use again!!

Very simple to make. You can substitute the french fried onions (which are usually next to the canned veggies in the supermarket) with potatoe chips. I would recommend 9"x9" dish unless you double the recipe. In my opinion the recipe desperately needs some vegetables, but I'm not that good a cook to make specific recommendations. A good salad side dish would help, too.

It was easy and good. We ate too much, though! As some have noted, the recipe is forgiving and lends itself to variations. I made is just as is., but might try to lighten it up a bit in the future.  The french-fried onion rock.

I’m not fond of tuna casserole but I will say this recipe is the best I have ever had and everyone loved it. Although I did feel it was a little dry so next time I will add a little milk with the soup.  I will definitely cook this again.  I was looking for low potassium recipes as my husband has kidney disease and this one came up and I’m so glad I found it.

Great for a base recipe BUT  I nearly had to double the ingredients to fill a 9x13 pan. Other than that, it was good. I needed to add salt and pepper at the table. Everyone at the potluck liked it. Next time I'll add garlic salt and pepper to the soup mixture and use cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and cream of celery. I think that will give it more flavor.        Four stars because it's a starter recipe.

Was a bit dry. Needs some milk or broth but just a small amount. I would also prefer cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and I used lite mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar to reduce fat.

The recipe did not call for milk with the condensed soup.  WhenI followed the recipe - only substituting ingredients that I had in the cupboard, mushroom soup for chicken, it was very disappointing.  The following night when I added milk and reheated the leftovers in a double boiler it was much better.  If I make this again I will add the milk at the beginning.

I made this casserole for my family.  They were not too excited for tuna casserole, but after all of us had seconds, I knew this was a winner!   Husband had it the next 2 days for lunch.  Super easy!   The only thing I added was one bag of frozen peas and carrots (I cooked them first) so I could get more veggies into the kids, lol.  One of my kids said how much they loved the fried onions.    Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

I liked the cheesy flavor, but it was too dry for me.  I will add some milk to the soup mix to compensate for that.  I used Fusilli noodles because I had some and found I like the way those noodles pick up the sauce and tuna with each bite.  Also, I like lots of tuna so I put in two cans.

Great recipe! I didn’t have fried onions so I crushed white cheddar cheez-it’s and baked them on top the whole time the casserole was in and they added some tangy deliciousness! Also used 1/2 cup milk and two cans of chicken condensed soup cuz I’m a saucy girl! Will make again!

Very Yummy..The kids loved it, and they aren't fans of fish.  Peas and garlic were the only additions I made, but that's personal preference.

I don't why anyone liked this?  Not nearly enough tuna.  All we tasted was the Fried Onions.  I see why people are suggesting two cans of tuna, and two cans of soup.

Best and indeed the easiest tuna casserole EVER!
My Dad and I have been looking for a great and easy tuna casserole for many years.  Due to having surgery and recovering I finally found time to find one and LOVE IT!

I followed the recipe to a T with a few little changes.  Here is what I did differently:

I used a smaller casserole dish, sprayed bottom and inside with butter spray, mixed everything (macaroni, tuna, soup, 1/2 cup cheese, 1/4 cup frozen peas) in a big plastic favorite bowl.  Next I put mixed ingredients in dish, added 1/2 cup cheese on top then baked for 25minutes.

The last thing I did was put total of 3/4 cup of Fried french onions on top and baked 5 minutes.

Best Tuna Casserole dish I've tasted in years!  The smile on my Dads face when he was eating was PRICELESS!  ?

This was good, but I added 4 cups of noodles and two cans of tuna. (Otherwise there is not really enough to bother with a 13x9 pan.)  I also added sauted mushrooms and some green onion chopped.

OK, but dryish as is.  LOVED the FF onions.  I am 75 yo and have made changes to this base recipe.  For people who complain about changes ...this is more rude than publishing changes because the comment box ASKS FOR THE CHANGES WE MAKE.   I do for my larger family 2-3 cans of tuna in water pack , keep the  water in for flavor and moisture.  Also use a can of corn niblets for texture and do no drain,  the juice is sweet. Handful of frozen peas and  some sautéed mushrooms, onions and garlic.  Use cream of mushroom 3 cans and 12 oz to 16 oz box of macaroni or other pasta such as penne.  Never add salt, but plenty of fresh ground pepper.  Some milk or sour cream if it needs moisture.  Itop with buttered soda cracker crumbs. I will use the submitter's FF  onion idea thanks for it.

Great base recipe! I used cream of mushroom since I had it on hand. Everything else was the same. I like a little spice so I added crushed red pepper and didn't want to waste half a bag of cheese (2 cups per bag) since I'm going out of town, so I added the rest into the mix. In an attempt to empty out my fridge before my trip, I also added celery and onion. YUM!

Delicious & super easy!!
I apologize in advance to those of you who dislike people reviewing recipes after changing them, but I did add a couple of ingredients to please my 14-year-old, who requested tuna casserole (?) for his birthday dinner. He loves cheese (one of his other favourite meals is Kraft dinner), so I added a generous amount of cream cheese and also some sour cream I had on hand. I doubled the recipe, and used my last can of cream of chicken soup along with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, and threw in a handful of chopped parsley that I wanted to use up. It turned out really delicious, the entire family loved it, and we had enough for lunches for the next day.
I will definitely make this again... it seems like something you can play around with in terms of adding additional ingredients to your taste, although I imagine it would be great made just as written, as well!

This is a delicious recipe!  I didn’t have the fried onions so I sliced my onions super thing, tossed them in a little flour, sprayed a little Pan on them and baked them at 450 degrees until they looked done.  They have so much more flavor!  My family loved this meal:).

Every thing was ready to go and I realized I didn't have any pasta. I made rice instead (only change I did). It was delicious. I will make it again with macaroni.

Since I had to make for big family I doubled macaroni, cheese and tuna. I used three cans cream of chicken. It didn’t ask for peas, salt or pepper but I added that for flavor. Family liked it a lot

Definitely easy, which is a must for me.  Tasted fine following the exact recipe, but might consider this a baseline next time and add something extra to zip it up a little.  Reminds me of my growing up years in the 1970's, so a nice nostalgic dish for me. :)

it's a great recipe!! I added one extra can of tuna, as I felt that it needed a smidge more of a tuna taste. I also exchanged the French onions for Doritos, as I did not have any when I made my dish. it tastes great! I will definitely use this one again!

I have a real love/hate relationship with this site.  I love that I've found a lot of really good recipes for everything from appetizer to dessert.  I hate that they allow people to drastically change a recipe, then rate it -- in effect, they're rating their own creation, rather than the original recipe!   My rating of *5* is based on the basic recipe, as written.  The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup milk, as I like it creamier.  Otherwise, it's great as written.

I know that Bennybbc rated and reviewed the recipe back in 08’ but just came upon the recipe today. I love the recipe as is and that being said as I started reading bennbc’s review I was at first perplexed than died laughing! How true, most reviews are completely different than the original recipe so therefore it’s not fair to rate a recipe when it’s not the same. Make it as is, rate it, then change it to your hearts delight.

Super easy, but I think 9x13 is too big a dish. 8x12 or 8x8 would work better. More tuna could also work. We added a can of mixed vegetables.

This was a quick meal that is perfect for the holiday season and also when you are short on time. The only change I made was to add a half a can of milk to the soup so that the casserole would be creamery. Lots of pepper also. Served it with hot rolls, delish.

I'm always searching for quick and easy weeknight meals. This fills the bill and we will be adding it to our winter casserole repertoire. I did add some fresh crushed pepper to the top of mine and that really enhanced the flavors. I might toy with tossing in a can or peas next time but this is tasty as is - the French fried onions are a nice touch!

I used a 12oz can of tuna and added some frozen peas. This fit fine in an oval approx 11 x 7 baking dish. There aren't enough ingredients to put this in a 13 x 9.

This was an awesome recipe! The only thing I added was Miracle Whip, because I added a little bit too much salt, so I needed something to take away the extra salt and that helped a hundred percent. Other than that I didn't change anything. My 4 year old kept repeating how good it was.

I made this recipe as written, except with two cans of albacore tuna, cream of mushroom soup from the pantry, 1/2 cup milk,  and I mixed the cheese into the casserole rather than on top. The addition of the French-fried onions made it tasty!   I baked it in a 7 x 12 Pyrex pan, and it filled the pan.  I will make this again as it was very good.

This is a delicious recipe and I've shared it with others.  I would make it again but made one major change.  The recipe calls for a 9x13 pan which is much too large for the amount of ingredients. I used an 8x8 pan which worked out perfectly.

I have made this recipe 3 times. It was 5-Star as written, which is how I made it the first time. The next time I tweaked it as follows: used 2 boxes of chickpea pasta Deluxe Mac & Cheese to which I added frozen peas & small diced carrots while the pasta boiled. I mixed in only one pouch of cheese spread  to the cooked & drained pasta along with the cream of chicken soup, tuna and 6 green onions-sliced. I topped the pasta mixture with a 1/3 cup each of shredded: Grand Cru, Havarti and sharp cheddar cheeses, and, baked as the recipe instructs. During the last 5 Minutes of baking, I garnished heavily with Lars imported crispy onions (find at Whole Foods or Amazon). My Bible Study group told me that this took Tuna Noodle Casserole to a whole new level.

Very good! I used a lot of the suggestions by other reviewers and added some ingredients of my own. Sweet peppers sliced thin and chopped onion added more flavor. Hubby loved it. Had lots leftover so I'll serve it as a side dish with burgers or hot dogs.

What a wonderful and simple recipe!  As much as I love tuna casserole, I haven't had it in years, since the last time I tried to make one it didn't come out all that great.  This recipe is the cure.  I only made one addition - I sauteed some chopped celery and celery leaves and added it to the mix.   I just had two helpings and I'm about to go back for a third!

I think this is a great recipe, however, I pan fried some portabello mushrooms, zuchinni and made peas to add when putting it all together. It added great taste.
I also added jack, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses enough for a slight flavor of the pepper jack to come through. At least a 1/2 cup of each a little more on the pepper jack. People went nuts over it!

As with most of our family casseroles, I decreased the carbs (used less pasta) and increased the protein (extra tuna and cheese stirred in). Used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, along with a good dab of mayo, 1/2 can milk,  and squirt of lemon juice.  First time this was a little bland, so This time I lightly sautéed celery, and added cooked peas and carrots, onion flakes, garlic powder, and red and black pepper.  The slight crunch of the celery gave a little texture and Great flavor. Cooked in 9 X 9 dish.  I had to jumpstart in the microwave for time saving, then stirred and topped with more cheese and the onion rings before baking.  Yum! This is a great, versatile recipe, but with these adaptations I think it's a favorite tuna casserole for us.

Never never rents your pasta! What you're doing is renting all the starch away which is a component that helps keep all of the sauces to absorb into the pasta – also removing some of the flavor. Otherwise very good –

I have not made this but my gut tells me that 3 cups of macaroni with only one can of soup would be way too much macaroni.  It would be dry as a bone.  I make mine with only one cup of macaroni a tin of cream of mushroom soup, a drained can of peas and lots of grated cheese.  I also put panko on the top and quite often slice a tomato over the cheese first, lots of pepper and then put dobs of butter on top of the panko...mmmm it is GOOD...but I think this recipe sounds awful.  I have not tried the fried onions but that might be a nice touch so I may try and add that to my own recipe just for something different.

Was easy to make and as-is an Honest 4 stars to my tastes. When I make again I will try some tweaks to suit my own personal tastes.  I continue to wish some other reviewers  would rate the recipe as written rather than some recipe they dream up which are often MUCH worse than the original recipe!

Really good. I used 2 cans of tuna, a cup of milk, peas, and mushrooms.  Also used more than 3 cups of noodles. Not sure how many, just know how much I need to fill my 9x13 pan. Turned out amazing. Will definitely make again.

Used to love this basic cream of  soup version of Tuna Casserole.  But then I learned to cook and now if I want this old comfort food I always use my own very simple cream of mushroom soup, which calls for a bit of Madeira wine (look up any turkey tetrazzini recipe; Tuna Casserole is essentially the same thing).  Try it, even if you follow this recipe to a tee otherwise...you'll elevate a ho hum dish to the divine.  I loved this old school version growing up in the 70's, but Supermarket cream of  soup has an off-putting aftertaste, in my opinion, but the homemade version is something you just want to drink.  Takes only slightly more effort.

I think this recipe is good as is.  If that can be considered a "huge"change, I just sprinkled a bit of freshly milled pepper to the mixture. I do agree that it needs a bit of water and to add more tuna. Even at half a recipe, which I did half a can of tuna and soup is not enough. So if you wish double at least the amount of tuna and add a bit of water. Will make it again as really is very quick and tasty.

This is an easy recipe and worth the try. One change I made was adding onion powder and sour cream and will add more next time! Was a great addition! Thank you for the recipe.

This was so easy to make - and so yummy!  My daughter had 3 servings.  I didn't have the FF onions, but I cooked some hashbrowns in the oven, and served it on the side (on my plate, I sprinkled some on top)  Thank you for a great recipe.  :)

This casserole was very tasty and easy to make. However, the recipe as written doesn't make enough mixture to put in a 9x13 inch baking dish. I used 4 cups of cooked macaroni, a 12 oz. can of tuna, added 2 cups frozen peas and covered the top with 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese. If you want to stick with the original recipe, use a smaller baking dish.

This was so dry. I followed the recipe exactly. It needed either more chicken soup or I needed to add mushroom soup. I don't know. I won't make it again.

It was pretty good. I loved the crunchiness and saltiness of the fried onion. I didn't expect it to make so little. My husband and I plowed through it in just a few small servings.

I agree with the posts on reviewing/modifying these recipes ...why people feel the need to completely change the recipe pointless and obnoxious.  No one cares, Keep it to yourself review the version posted unless you want to post your own recipe!  I enjoyed this As Is !! Thanks...

Made the recipe as-is. It is flavourful but dry. Maybe adding half a can of cream or milk with the soup would've been nice.

It was a hit with everyone! I made it as is, but added some frozen peas, so I didn't have to make a separate vegetable (just mixed them in still frozen when I added the soup).

I did add about 1/3c of baby peas only because this is how I grew up eating it.   It had excellent taste and consistency.  Only thing I would change is making the recipe 50% larger since it barely covered the bottom of the 13x9.

This was pretty yummy but I found it could have used another can of soup as it was a bit dry. 

The comment box asks **Did you make any changes, and will you make it again?

Yes. I didn't have Cream of Chicken soup but had Cream of Mushroom and I didn't have onion rings. I added a little celery  and leaves. I also threw on some grated Parmesan cheese. 

It would have been delicious without my substitutions. And yes, I will make it again. This time I will try Cream of Chicken soup.

Quite good! I definitely wanted a little bit more flavour, so used one of the suggestions of another can of tuna, peas, some mustard, and our favourite garlic seasoning. We also like to switch up the topping, using whatever's on-hand (tortilla chips, goldfish crackers, etc). Really quick and easy, and sure to please!

This is a great tuna casserole recipe. The french fried onions turn a frumpy comfort food dish into a fancy comfort food dish.  My boys like the old potato chip  topping but either way, a great go to recipe.

I think I just found out that I don't like tuna when it is hot. I have never made a tuna bake before and I can't remember my mom ever making one either.  But my family loves tuna sandwiches so I thought this would work.  That being said, I follow the directions exactly.  It was actually a bit too salty for me.  Maybe because of the salt in the soup?  It was just ok for me. I don't think I would be able to eat more than a bit or two.  My family isn't exactly lining up to try it.  Hopefully at least one will give it a go.  Semi-disappointed.

I could not stop eating this. It's a wonderful, simple, quick and tasty meal. My husband even liked it and he normally only likes a meal if it has some type of meat in it. I stuck pretty closely to the original recipe, I only added some frozen peas, a few mushrooms and some diced onions everything else was as per the original and I thought the flavor was great. Thank you for contributing this recipe. I know I will be making it often.

This is the first tuna casserole I've made. I learned the following helpful tips from the numerous reviews to make the best of this recipe: 2 cups of dry pasta equates to 3 cups cooked pasta; Use 2 cans of tuna (I used albacore); Use 2 cans of cream of whatever to prevent the dish from being dry (I used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom.)  For my personal preference, I also used 2 cups of shredded cheese (1 cup mixed with the other ingredients and one cup sprinkled on top) and I didn't use the French Friend Onions. As other reviewers suggested, I may add a splash of milk to the mixture for even creamier results, and I may add peas to make the casserole a bit more rounded. This is an excellent recipe that was easy to follow to produce a tasty meal.

Made this twice the first time followed the recipe was ok but lacked a little. second time I added a second can of tuna and peas. My daughter is a very picky eater but she loved the second batch so much she keeps asking me to make it again.

Great base recipe. I added capers and mixed in some cheese with the tuna and the soup. Also, next time I'll use 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup.

This was a simple, easy to make recipe--- especially good for people who don't like tuna. Maybe it's because there's Cream of Chicken soup in it, but the tuna flakes really tasted more like chicken. My only suggestions would be to use a smaller pan than 9x13 to build a thicker casserole, and go easy on the French Fried Onion Strings (because it gets a little salty). But overall, I'd make this again!

The only changes I made were to reduce the cheese and french fried onions by 1/4 cup each, just to save a few calories. I personally thought it was a little bland, but my two teenage boys scarfed this stuff down like it was the best meal they'd ever eaten! I had four people to feed last night, expected to have leftovers for another night, but they ate all of it!  My 10 year old ate most of hers, but like me, didn't love it. But, my teens had their first day at new schools today, so I wanted to give them some comfort food. This, apparently hit the spot. And I still liked it well enough to declare this a keeper, and will now play with it to give it better flavor.

This is great. I used cream of mushroom soup, as that is what I had, and a half can of milk.  Other than that, made as is.

I have never liked egg noodles with tuna casserole and this was a welcome change.  I thought it was delicious and so did my husband.

I try to make meals that are healthy and clean most of the week, but some days I am jut TIRED.  This will be in the rotation of lazy days without a doubt.

I made this and took direction from others and tried the extra tuna and the 2 different types of soups. It was very yummy!! I still feel there is room to play with this and make it my own though so will be making this over and over to try a few things out. No matter what though I am sure that using this as a base recipe will ensure it turns out fab.

really filling and yummy however a bit more on the blander side with little spices or herbs used, could be incorporated to enhance flavor of the cheese and tuna, but overall really easy to make

Even though I made some changes, the basic recipe is five stars in my opinion!  Used a heaping  two cups of dry elbow macaroni, added 1/2 cup of milk, frozen peas, extra can of tuna, and one extra can of cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup, a little over 2 cups of shredded cheese, along with a zesty seasoning mix, this one was called garlic and herb.  I topped it off with sliced tomatoes and baked then added the french fried onions as directed at the end.

I made it per the recipe and baked in an oval Pyrex baker (same one I use for homemade mac n cheese).  Great flavor but too dry for 4 out of 5 of our family members.  Will try again and double the soup or maybe use some milk with the soup.  And I think I probably used a little less of the French fried onions because it did look dry when it finished baking, but that is really just a topper to your liking.   A good base for a recipe though to tweak to your preferences.

This was a great quick and easy recipe to make.  I added bacon bits instead of fried onions, since I didn't have any at home.  Tasted just as yummy!  I think next time I will try adding some bread crumbs on top for an added crunchy texture.

I have been cooking over 50 yrs. and can honestly say this is the best Tuna casserole ever. My husband and son loved it. Only change I made was minor. I used egg noodles also added 1/2 cup of low fat milk and a can of drained green peas. The onions really made a difference. They were crunchy and very tasteful.  Will definitely make again.

I made it exactly as the original instructions say and I like it pretty well. It is a little dry though so I think next time I will add more soup and cheese, but otherwise it's a nice simple college dinner!

I followed other reviews and used 1 cn cream of chicken and 1 cn cream of mushroom and potato chips instead of fried onions, my kids don't like the onions.  My husband said it was still dry, but the rest of us liked it.

I made this but used 12 oz tuna, frozen peas and carrots, added 1/2 soup can of milk and used crunched potatoes chips on top.  Everyone liked it at this house.  I will make this again. This could be made ahead, chips added and popped in the oven for a quick meal.

I went according to directions one exception and a future change in mind. I added some frozen peas to this recipe. As I will make this again, I plan to moisten with either with small amount of vegetable broth or water as we thought this was a bit on the dry side. Otherwise great simple recipe to make.

Made it twice. Once with premium cream of mushroom, the second with low sodium (both Campbells brand). First try, AN AMAZING SUCCESS. Not too salty or bland. Second one however, was bland. Note to self: the taste will differ IMMENSILY depending on the type of cream of mushroom you use so choose the soup wisely. Went back to original cans i bought from food4less and havent went back since. Apart from that issue, amazing recipe. HIGHLY recommend, loved it.

If you like tuna casserole's it's worthy of 4 star's, it was pretty good and easy but didn't knock my socks off. I wouldn't use the Cream of Chicken again, found it a bit overpowering ..I will probably go with Cream of Mushroom next time. But that is just personal preference as my fiance didn't mind the chicken soup flavour.

Very dry and not worth the effort even though it was easy to make. Also needs more tuna.

Minor mods and suggestions are always helpful, such as adding another can of tuna, which is what I'll do when I make it again.  I thought the french fried onions were a great addition and I made my own for this recipe.  Great job LMCDEVIT!

Great recipe! Although I didn't have all the ingredients,  I made do with a can of chicken instead of tuna, added a can of mushroom soup with a can of milk, peas, leftover Mexican cheese and mozzarella, pepper, and garlic powder. Topped off with the rest of the mozzarella and some shredded parmesan I had left. Very tasty and will make again!

This is the tuna casserole I grew up on.  If I don't have the onions, I tear up 3 pieces of bread and pour 1/2 stick butter over it and put that on top.  Yummy!

If I make this again I will add an extra can of cream of chicken soup and some sour cream. Maybe 25 minutes is too long to cook it, but it was very dry with just one can of cream of chicken so some adjustments can be made to make this better!

4 stars for being a good base recipe, but it definitely needs something(s) added. I had to make my own cream of chicken soup and fried onions which didn't come out great, and all I had was a bag of mixed cheeses so I'm sure it would taste more like what I was expecting if I had the actual ingredients it called for on hand. With that being said, I still feel that it's lacking- I will try some other reviewers' suggestions next time to kick it up a notch. Overall good recipe to build on!

My family loves this! I have made this so many times as is and it's delicious! I have played with it a bit and add about 1/2 can of milk to thin it out just a bit and typically use rotini noodles instead of macaroni. I will sometimes add frozen peas or broccoli to it as well.  The cheddar French fried onions also work really well on top, so sometimes I do that.  Any way I mix it up, it's always a hit and I never make less than a double batch! Thank you for sharing!!!

I put a twist to it one package of sliced mushrooms sauteed with 1/2 small onion in butter. And he does the can of chicken soup with three slices of sharp cheddar in the microwave until melted. Added one can of peas noodles tuna mushrooms and onions. Baked in the oven 350 for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Top with French fried onions bake an additional 5 minutes

I was looking to make some leftover baked salmon filets into a casserole but couldn't really find any recipes for that. I came across this recipe and figured I'd just substitute the salmon for tuna as they're more or less the same anyways. I made the recipe as is (with the exception of the tuna, of course) and wow, it was delicious. I absolutely loved it and will definitely be making this again in the future, with salmon or tuna (either way, it's great)! Thank you!

I had to use pepperjack cheese in place of cheddar and used cream of mushroom because I didn't have the cheddar or cream of chicken and it still came out pretty good.  I would add about half of a medium onion next time for more flavor but I do like how quick this was to make and my B/F, who is really picky, loved it.

I'm not easily impressed, but this was delicious! I used what I had on hand and am exceptionally happy with the result.  I only had cream of mushroom soup, so I used that instead of cream of chicken.  I increased both the tuna (used 2 cans)  and macaroni to fill my 13x9 pan.  I took other reviewers' advice and added milk.  (I had a can of evaporated milk, so I used that.) I threw in some frozen mixed vegetables because I didn't have peas, as others suggested.   I was short on fried onions, so I used what I had and made up the difference with panko  bread crumbs.  DELISH!

Not sure what is lacking in this recipe.  It's not bad, but I don't blame those that need to add things for more flavor.  To each's own, right?  Sometimes it's necessary to make it to your liking. I think the thing that makes this recipe is the french fried onions. Throw tons on there.

This is a very simple recipe. My husband and I don't care for tuna but my daughter loves this recipe. I've made this once before. I will make it again. I used crushed potato chips because I couldn't find the french fried potatoes.

When my picky eaters like it - it works for me.  I fixed this exactly as recipe states & it was fine.  No need to change anything.

I did not care for this recipe. It looked awesome, but was so bland. Not a keeper at all.

Disappointed...Very dry...If I make it again I would use less macaroni & more tuna...I added chopped celery & onions and if it hadn't been for the french fried onion rings, this dish would have had no flavor whatsoever...It 'was' simple & quick to make but that's the only good thing I can say about it...

I feel bad giving a 1 star review, because the actual concept is good.  However, as many people state... it is only fair to rate the recipe as written.  As written, very, very dry and bland, to say the least.  As the ingredients do not have to be cooked to be safe to taste, you can tell when mixing everything and tasting it that it is just... tasteless.  BUT in all fairness... this is a great base, and you can really tweak it to your own taste!  I added additional soup, tuna... lots of salt and pepper... a bit of Tabasco... onion and garlic... some heavy cream and a little skim milk...  and if I could review that, I would have given it a much higher rating.  I admittedly wouldn't have come up with this combo on my own, so it was a great base to play with and I have many ideas for future tries.  But as is, it is pretty bad.

Super easy, fun and tasty.  Boilerplate with endless variations.  I'm vegetarian so subbed chick peas for tuna and cream of celery for chicken soup.  Used cheese I had and added peas and spices.  Threw some panko crumbs on top.  Thank you for this.

This casserole was easy to make and had good flavor but it was way too salty for me. My hubby loved it though so I am giving this 3 stars. Next time I will make my own creamy soup base and add veggies to control the amount of sodium.

Husband said "yummy" which is a huge compliment.  I think this twist of a standard tuna noodle casserole is wonderful.  The french fried onions made it special.   I wanted more tuna so added an extra can.  Didn't have more soup so added 3/4 cup of FF half and half and a pinch of cayenne for my taste.  I feel these changes were not enough to not rate this recipe.  We shall make it more often.

Recipe was great. Only thing I did different was use two cans of tuna and added more cheese. This is one of those wonderful recipes you can take in different directions depending on what you add/omit. Finally got my 7year old to eat onions.

It's in the oven right now. Came home tonight looking to make something warm, delicious, easy and fast that would make use of the container of French's fried onions before I ate them all straight out of the jar. This recipe was waiting for me in my email inbox. AllRecipes saves the day!

I usually use a cheese sauce instead of soup but I will try using the soup, Also for a low carb twist being a diabetic I substitute the macaroni for cauliflower also adds to the flavour :-)

I never heard of using cream of chicken. I use cream of mushroom and  cream of celery, l can each. I use a can of milk and shredded cheese which I cook until all is creamy and then pour it over my macaroni and tuna. Give it a little stir and then top it all off with crushed potato chips. Actually never tried this recipe but it sounds good so I gave it the five stars. I might substitute the onions for the chips next time I cook this.

I was a little hesitant to use the French Fried onions on top of this casserole, but after tasting am so glad that I did.  It added a different flavor to the dish that everyone seemed to enjoy, even my picky eaters. I like the fact that I had all the ingredients in my cupboard.  Fast and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

I love Tuna Casserole I've made it a lot when I've forgotten to take meat out for supper. This recipe is great just as is. I didn't have fried onions so I fried a bit in butter which worked great.Cheese and tuna is a go to comfort supper. Thanks for posting this gives me a new twist on an easy supper.

I agree with most others who reviewed this recipe, it was a wonderful base recipe, but it needed something extra.  I think I'm going to add some Velveeta to the leftovers.  I always add garlic powder to just about everything, so that's already been done.  It just lacked something and needed some zest.  
:)

I made it exactly as written, even measuring out the macaroni, and I didn't like it at all. It was very bland and the tuna taste (I used Starkist) just didn't meld well with all the other ingredients.

This recipe is so much fun to play around with (I say with a bite of it in my mouth)! I followed the base along with some of the suggestions from the reviews. I added a can of cream of chicken, a can of cream of mushroom, half a bag of frozen peas, half a bag of frozen chopped onions, and garlic powder. I was afraid to add salt because I topped it with parmesean, provolone, and bread crumbs. It "could've" used some salt, but I'm not a salt person so I thought it was good. Perhaps I'll use green beans instead of peas for Thanksgiving!

I just made it. It was easy and great. Next time I too will add another can of tuna. My fiance' suggested I added chopped thawed vegetables for him, he loved it. He said use half of the macaroni but I dont think so he's a big guy, he ate half of the casserole. Thanks for the easy receipe.

I wasn't sure if I was a "tuna" person or not but tried it out anyway. I made it almost as is.... I used a large can of tuna, a family sized can of soup, some minced onion flakes, and a pinch of seasoned salt and pepper. I topped with crumbled ritz and sharp cheddar. It was pretty good. Kind of fishy but that wasn't unexpected.

I didn't have FF onions but I crumbled up sum bagged herb stuffing mix n only had cream of mushroom soup but I boiled my noodles in chicken broth! My oldest daughter absolutely loves tuna casserole as do I...my other daughters would rather I leave out the tuna! This is the simplest recipe to follow n I agree wit "ChgoFoodieGal"...if u don't like it just don't make it! Adjusting n replacing is changing the recipe...substitute at minimal as I did....enjoy, because we did! ????

Super easy, and very yummy! I just doubled everything and added peas. This will be a staple for dinner from now on.

Very good and creamy.  Just added some milk and an extra can of tuna as someone suggested.  It needs a little more moisture and the milk adds that. Very picky husband liked it too.

This was a great recipe! It seems very simple when you read it - and it is - nice and easy to make. The picture shows peas in it but they weren't listed in the recipe! I added some frozen ones anyway and I think they are a must. but it's the best tuna noodle casserole I've ever eaten! We put a dollop of sour cream on top and that finished it off!

This was so delicious! It was a little bland, so we had to sprinkle a bit of salt on it, but overall it was amazing! My family doesn't like tuna, so I substituted it for chicken, and it was still really good! Next time, I'm thinking I'm going to add some vegetables in it. It was the best fresh out of the oven, and leftovers were okay (the french fried onions got a little soggy!).

Always a hit with my son. I leave out the peas as he does not like them and add spices according to our taste.  This is great in the winter to make after getting home from work.  Can make ahead as well for the next night too.

Not that great, kinda bland. I'm not a fan of tuna so I used canned chicken and that either ruined it or this recipe was not that great to begin with. I could think of a few things I would add to it but I won't elaborate. Just not a fan.

Made it as written and it was good comfort food.  I did change the FF onions to potato chips on DHs suggestion.  I used 4 cups of cooked macaroni shells and I thought it was a bit dry, but that was my fault. 
For those trying to figure out how much dry pasta is cooked, by my measurements 8oz dry = 4c. cooked.  Next time, I will use 6oz. dry should = 3 c. cooked.

Made this for dinner tonight. I added a can of peas for extra flavor.  My only negative comment about this recipe is that is was a little dry and needed seasoning.  I will definitely make it again but tweek the recipe a bit.

I don't like tuna and I ate this so that's saying something! I read some of the reviews and I did add garlic powder, black pepper, Accent, & cayenne pepper for flavoring. I also mixed in peas & carrots and French onions. I only cooked for 3 so I used 1 can tuna and 1.5 cups of pasta and 1 can cream of mushroom soup but everything was still too dry when I was mixing so I added some milk. The recipe was good but next time I need to add more sauce.

This tasted great, and was very easy to make - I doubled it for a larger casserole. The only thing I had to guestimate was the cups of cooked macaroni, as the cup amounts are different between cooked and uncooked. But, more noodles are always a plus!

Pretty good! I added lots of pepper just b'c I like pepper with tuna. I did about 3/4 of the noodles and put in a 9X9 pan instead. Still used 1 can tuna and all the cheese! I liked it cheesey!

I liked this recipe just as it is.  Maybe someone can tell me if they added more liquid, were the onions still nice and crunchy?  That was my favorite part.  I was a bit short on the cooked macorni so I just used one 5 oz. can of tuna which was perfect.  I'll be making this again!  I'm disappointed that we can no longer make notes or edit our recipe without paying.

This was good and super easy.  I did add a small can of drained peas.  There are peas in the pic so I thought maybe the submitter may have accidentally left them
out?  I read the other reviews and the recipe may benefit from a little extra milk although my kids loved it as is - and that's saying something lol. Oh, I used organic natural cream of mushroom in lieu of cream
Of chicken.  Love that stuff.

I tried this recipe tonight. It did not get bubbly at all. It is extremely dry and probably could have used some water or more soup. I followed the recipe exactly. Can't say I'll make it again unless I vary the recipe and change the cheese to a softer one.

I've made tuna casserole this way for years; but instead of cream of chicken soup; i use cream of celery soup. gives a little more flavor to the casserole. For the "adult version", i get the tuna packets that are tuna steaks in lemon pepper. Again, more flavor. Always, always, use french fried onion rings in casserole as well as on top.

This is a good recipe, however not the best, and that is okay of course. I do not like changing the ingredients as a few others have noted.....but to add is different. Lightly cook 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion, adding to mix. It will delight you, if you like onion.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was great!  Easy to make and very tasty.  I used 1-1/2 cups of dry macaroni to make 3 cups of cooked.  If you wanted to change it up, you could add peas and sautéed mushrooms, but you certainly don't need to. I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

It's perfect.  This is not a real exciting recipe, however everything turns out great, every time I make it, there's never any left overs.  Sometimes I crumble potato chips over the top and sometimes I use french's fried onions.

Great food! Even my brother who is picky with foods, finished his whole plate! The only problem i had while doing this recipe, my oven isn't functioning. So what i did was used my pan. The taste still turned out great! :)

Fast, easy, and yummy!  I followed the recipe except that after putting into the casserole dish I microwaved for 3 minutes before putting into the oven to cut down on prep time.

Liked it.  Used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Sauteed onion and celery first, then mixed it into the casserole. Can use any kind of pasta.

Great recipe! I loved the french onions on top. I added about 2 cups of frozen peas and 1 can of diced tomatoes for some color (and nutrition).

I actually thought this was delicious! Though I swapped the macaroni for bow tie pasta, and the cream of chicken to cream of celery, still tasted amazing!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as it was written, I just added a half can of water to the mixture. It was pretty good but it was definitely missing something. Next time I may add milk instead of water and maybe an extra can of tuna.

Excellent base recipe. I added 1/2 jar of pimentos (which was great, next time I'll add more) and omitted peas. I also used egg noodles. 

Fried onions=great casserole topping.

My husband HATES fish and he happily gobbled down two portions and took it for lunch the next day.

I tried the recipe because it seemed so basic to make. I followed the recipe without changing any of the ingredients. My husband and I both thought that the casserole was too dry. I'm thinking I should have added another can of cream of chicken soup, maybe some frozen peas, and a dash of pepper. I believe I will look for another tuna casserole recipe because we really do like tuna casserole.

I totally agree with ChgoFoodieGal...only review a receipe if you tried the receipe you're reviwing...not some new concoction you've come up with. We loved this receipe. I used a smaller casserole dish and added black pepper...but otherwise followed the receipe exactly as printed. Great leftover, too!!

I liked the ease of it. I will make this again. I didn't have enough shredded cheese, so I added Velveeta cheese to it. I also seasoned it with Old Bay. So, next time I make it I will go strictly by the recipe. I couldn't get to the store..lol. I also added sweet peas only because I saw it in the picture. It's a hit.

Made this last night and it was great, no leftovers. I did add a second can of tuna and used cream of mushroom because I didn't have cream of chicken. This is a keeper.

Yum!  Even if the taste had been a 4, the ease of prep would easily have boost it up to a 5 because in my book that's a huge factor in revisiting a recipe.  But no boosting needed! I made it as written and thought it was excellent.  I did add peas though because I wanted a veggie component but it would still have been just as tasty without. I can see adding another can of tuna next time and a splash of milk, but that is NOT enough crtisism to knock it down at all.  Really- it only took as long as it takes to boil pasta to prep and even my 14 month old daughter wanted seconds!

Well, I am rating this before my family has even tasted it.  If I need to I will come back and adjust it.  The only thing that I changed (because I don't have any and this was made at the last minute) was the french fried onions for corn flakes.  This was such a super easy recipe and I am sure that my family is going to love it.  Sure, you can add what you want to it, but you don't have to!  It smells delicious...cannot wait for the hubby to come home so that we can eat!!!

I made this exactly as directed. My husband and 5 yr old loved it and said to be sure to make it again. I thought it was ok, a bit bland, but that's what tuna casserole is.  My 3 yr old, who loves tuna helper, took one bite, and asked for a hot dog. I will try this again, perhaps with cream of mushroom instead of celery. Best of all... it's SIMPLE!  Thanks!

We loved it! Very easy and better than the "box" version. I added cooked broccoli (so it would be soft) and lots of the fried onions. I also added a bit extra milk, I could tell that without it the meal would be a little to dry for my taste. The onions really make this meal, without them it would be a little bland.

My Casserole using this recipe came out extremely dry. I followed the recipe exactly. It stuck to the sides of the baking dish very badly as well. It did taste good though. It might have been better with a little more soup?

This dish was was so easy!  And tasted great!  I used cream of mushroom soup instead, which added a littel more flavor.  Kid friendly too...which is a plus.

This was ok. It has a lot of potential. I used crushed cheesy crackers on top instead of fried onions because I don't like fried onions & that was really good. The only problem with it was it was really dry. It maybe needs sour cream or milk or velveeta added to it to help out with the dryness.

I agree this is a good basic recipe, and because it is basic it leaves room for experimentation.  In my case, I added a cup of frozen peas because I don't feel that it is a proper tuna casserole without them!  I also increased the amount of tuna and noodles to two cans and 4 cups, respectively.  Since I increased the dry ingredients I added 1/4 cup milk.  I didn't have FF onions, so I made breadcrumbs with whole wheat bread, olive oil, and garlic powder.  Very easy and tasty dish!

i added a can of mixed veggies and used crushed plain potato chips instead of french fried onions.  Along with some seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder) it was very good.

Good quick weeknight recipe.  Didn't have any of the french fried onions, but still turned out ok.  Also used cr of mushroom soup instead, and added some frozen veggies.  Quick and easy.

First of all, with that many noodles I had to add 3 cans of tuna (even coulda' used 4).  Also, this recipe was missing the salt and pepper it soooo desperately needed.

If I had eaten this alone, I would have only given it 2 stars, but my husband kinda liked it, so I'll give it 3.  This is pretty bland, even after I added spices to it.  It's pretty similar to Tuna Helper, but it's more work and not as good.  I doubt I'll make this again.

I appreciate the variations on the recipe by those that have been there, done that, and tested on their families. Personally I made the recipe exactly as written and found it to be good but a bit bland. I will make again and try some of the alterations, it is a great starting point thou.

This is a tough one for me.  My kids devoured this!  They LOVED it.  My husband thought it was really good.  I personally would have given it 3*'s.  It was a bit bland for my liking and a bit dry.  I will try it again though and maybe use 2 cans of soup.  The onions really make the dish though!

Very good. Husband was skeptical about tuna casserole.  I added the milk and peas as suggested in other reviews.  He enjoyed it, but the the french onions he could have did with out.  It was just fine for me.  Thanks for a quick and delicious recipe and an alternative to cream of mushroom soup!!!

Very very good. I doubled the recipe and added cream of mushroom soup in place of one of the cream of chicken soups. Also I added one half can of milk because I felt that the recipe was going to be dry. Thanks so much!

My son's favorite tuna casserole! I do add more cheese on top, as well as stir in half of the fried onions into the mixture before baking. LOVE it!

I love this recipe as is; but sometimes I make modifications.  This is a great recipe when I have left over noodles.  Adding milk & cream of mushroom soup will make it creamier.  In addition adding minced onions or chopped onions will flavor it more.  But as stated again this is a great recipe as is.  My 3 year old loves it.

I fallowed this recipe and found it was very bland and missing something. Maybe adding some basil, dash of sage, couple small piece of broccoli and some finely diced red pepper will help. thanks anyhow

I thought this was dry.  Maybe another can of soup would help.  If I made it again, I'd try that along with adding some veggies...sauteed mushrooms, onions, green peppers.

I made this recipe as is.  It came out really dry.  Next time I make it, I will make sure to add at least 1-2 cups milk.  I also think that there was something missing.  Next time I will add peas, mushrooms, maybe some chopped celery, something to add to it.  The flavor was good, just way to dry and needed something else.

It's OK, definitely nothing special and does need to be doctored up for us. Helpful enough review, especially to those that are new cooks? 
I personally like reading other's suggestions and I know how to cook.
It helps me not waste my time or money on an average or poor recipe and instead shows me ideas to enhance it without having to waste my time scrolling through numerous recipes for basically the same thing. So thanks to those of you who are generous enough to help out a cook.  Any real cook doesn't and shouldn't mind alterations of their recipe to begin with.

I pretty much always "tweek" a recipe to my tastes.  No major changes to this one, though, and it turned out EXCELLENT.  This is now on our regular rotation.  Simple and delicious, just the way I like it.

I love this recipe! I love the creamy and cheesy-ness of it. You have to use the french fried onions on top of the whole thing. It makes the recipe what it is. I only put the onions on half and everyone wanted the crunchy side. I also like how inexpensive this recipe is to make. I need cheap meals on my grocery list these days!

Was okay. Needed quite a bit more tuna in our opinions. A little more spice would be good too, but I'm not sure what flavors would go well with it. Will have to experiment with it next time.

This was not as good as I had hoped it would be. It needed alot more sauce in it. Probably adding more soup to it would make it alot better. Was just very dry.

Great base for a great tuna casserole.  I, like the other reviewers, used cream of mushroom soup - 2 cans to be exact, and 2 cans of tuna.  I also added 3/4 can of milk and a little bit of soy sauce to make it a little more zippy.  I didn't have alot of cheese on hand. . .about a half a cup - but it was enough.  Very good.

Super good, super easy and best of all... SUPER CHEAP!  What, like $2-$3 to make this meal?  Oh my only suggestion would be to make it in a 9x9 dish.  9x13 was just too big.

I accidentally mixed the cheese in instead of putting it on top and it ended up being really dry. The flavor was good so I think I'll try it again the correct way.

My two picky children didn't want any but my baby ate all three portions!  I'm thrilled because with all of his food allergies, his diet can be quite limited.  Great taste, and easy to fix.

This dish was wonderful!  I pretty much made it as described except for adding an extra can of tuna (you wouldn't have to), and using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup- which was a personal preference.  It's even tastier the next day! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night.  I would not make this again.  I did not change the recipes except I tossed part of the fried onions in the mixture.  The flavor needs it.  And I only had 2% cheese.  The casserole is too too dry; the chicken soup did not marry with the tuna.  I would find a different recipe.  Sorry!!

the idea of having a french onions or potatoes chips on top was great! however the actually casserole itself lacked taste.  i should have added pepper or salt.  i needed to eat it with alot hot sauce to give it an extra kick and make it good. if i do decide to make this again it will be a while.

I haven't made tuna casserole in years!  Saw this recipe and decided it was "what's for dinner tonight"!  I used 2 cans tuna, whole wheat pasta, added frozen peas, and topped with crushed potato chips as I didn't have any french fried onions.  Served with homemade biscuits!  Absolutely yummy - and the family loved it!

This was quick, easy & good! I didn't have the french fried onions so I topped with cheddar cheese. I had a can of peas with pearl onions so I added that & it turned out really well. The left-overs are good reheated too!

This stuff is really good. I made it exactly by the recipe, but next time I think I'll add green peas and use Velveeta instead of cheddar. Mushroom soup would also be great. This casserole is simple, easy, and fast.

I put in two cans of tuna... one can didn't seem enough ... and I added extra cheese and onions.  We like lots of toppings!

My teenager who 'hates' tuna had two servings.  The husband loved it, too.  This recipe's a keeper.

I was craving tuna casserole but didn't know where to start.... this recipe was perfect to get my creative juices flowing!

I used about 1/2 to 3/4 box of whole wheat penne/corkscrew mix pasta.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken soup (both reduced fat).  I used 1 can peas, 2 cans of chunk light tuna and about 2/3 to 1 cup fat free mayo.  I sprinkled some garlic powder and added some dill weed and used dried onion flakes, all mixed in.  All together, this made one 8x8 and an 8x11 dish's worth.  I didn't have cheddar so I placed slices of provolone on top and sprinkled with Italian bread crumbs.  It is still in the oven as I type- I will update this when I taste it!!  I can't wait!
*Update* Tastes GREAT!  Very creamy and moist with just enough tuna flavor!  Going back for seconds now!  I froze the 8x8 dish for later...  Thanks for a great base recipe!!

MADE THIS LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS VERY EASY TO PREPARE. GO EASY ON THE FRENCH'S FRIED ONIONS. IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH BUT THERE IS. THIS SERVING SIZE IS PERFECT FOR TWO HUNGRY ADULTS WITH ONE SERVING LEFT OVER FOR A LUNCH FOR ONE.

Easy recipe and kids love it! I made this for a friend who had just gotten out of the hospital. She freezed it and cooked it later and her kids said it was amazing. Be creative with the recipe - you can't mess it up. I used whole wheat spiral pasta and cream of mushroom soup in mine. I also stir in some frozen peas because I like the color and the flavor. Enjoy!

This recipe was good. I appreciate the tips and additional versions of the recipe offered by members. I don't think it is rude at all. I have found it very helpful and love to read the reviews before I try a new recipe out. Many cooks are creative people and it is fun to see what we all concoct. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Was okay. My husband liked it, I would have liked it better if it was chicken instead of tuna because of the cream of chicken.

I've made this a million times exactly as written (although sometimes I omit the fried onions because my daughters don't like them!)  It is excellent comfort food, and so incredibly easy.  I love that it can be made with things you can keep in the pantry indefinitely.  It has saved me a couple of times!  Thanks for sharing it.

Very good, quick and easy!  Also kid friendly, which is essential around here.  I've cooked it as written, and it's simple and yum.  I sometimes add in sauteed onions, celery, and carrots; because the little one eats his veggies that way.  I usually also add 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.  Thanks much!  Busy moms sometimes need simplicity!

I like this, but tweaked it a little so I can use up the stuff in my fridge: I heated up 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery, with some Velveeta cheese and about 1/2 can of skim milk. 
Then I sautee some chopped bell peppers, onions because I have them in the fridge. Toss with a can of salmon and a can of tuna. Lastly, topped with mozzerella cheese b/c thats all I have. 
Add some garlic powder, pepper, cajun spices. :) YUMMMY!!!
My boyfriend LOVED it!!!!! :)

First of all I want to say this was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made .Secondly I want to say it tasted fantastic! Put that all together you have yourself one awesome recipe! The only change I made was to saute some extra onions because I love onions in my Tuna. I even had seconds and I am on a diet...Please don't tell on me! Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  My husband raved!  I tried to keep the recipe simple, but made the following changes...I used whole wheat penne noodles (allow a bit longer cooking time), cream of chicken soup with herbs and two cans of tuna.  Mmmmm!

I can't understand how this recipe got such good ratings.  I found this dish to be very bland and dry.  I did add an extra can of tuna and 3/4 can of milk as suggested, but it was still pretty uninspiring.  It was okay, it wasn't BAD, but definitely not GREAT.  I won't make this version again.

Really enjoy this! I used others suggestions and added a bit of milk, 1/2 cup mayo,some frozen peas, and garlic seasoning, and S&P. I used crushed potato chip on top. Make it every other week! 
Thank you!

It looked a little monochrome, so I added peas...I also added onions.  Then, it was great!

It was ok.  It was actually a bit dry.  I think if I use velveeta or something next time as well as normal cheese it would be better.  I even used less noodles and it was still somewhat dry.  But the flavor was great.

I added the extra can of soup as was suggested and I'm glad I did.  Recipe was okay, but would have been way too dry with only one can of soup, thus the reason I gave it three stars.

This was good, but if I make it again I will cut the amount of pasta in half and put it in an 8x8 pan.  I added a little more cheese to the top and did not put on quite as many onions as it called for and I  am also glad I did that.  It just could have been a little creamier for us.

What I love about this recipe is that it is so easy to adapt.  I didn't have the canned soup, so I just made a thick white sauce and spiced it with my favorite spice blend.   I also took a previous reviewer's advice and doubled the tuna, but for the sake of my small children, next time I will probably double the tuna but increase the other ingredients because it was a bit of tuna overload for them and took much coaxing (i.e., offering more of the onions from the can) to get them to finish every bite.  I will be making this again!

I really liked how EASY this was!  It tastes great too!  I added a can of peas to make it a bit heartier.  Also, I wonder if this would be better made with cream of mushroom soup?   Great recipe, would recommend for a quick, easy, and tasty meal!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, the only thing I did was used 2 cans of tuna and I mixed some fried onions in with the casserole besides what goes on top. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and oh so good! Made a few additions though by chopping up some onions, celery and carrots then sauteed them in a bit of butter until tender then added that to the dish before baking. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and stirred it into the mixture before baking. I only make tuna casserole because my family likes it. I'm not too crazy about it myself. But this recipe was a winner. I loved it as much as the familia this time. Thanks for the recipe!

It won't win any gourmet prizes, but it was definitely a winner for my hubby - he said it took him back to his childhood!  Plus it was super easy and not heavy on the ingredient list.  

I doubled the tuna, but I think next time I would use 3 cans because it still didn't feel like it had a whole lot of tuna in there.  Everything else I did as per the recipe - the FF onions were excellent on the top, but I think breadcrumbs would also work well with the cheese.  

Great to make ahead for a busy day and throw in the oven.  Baby loved it too!

Not bad! Used Mozza, cream of mushroom, peas and spices. Didn't have french fried onions. I'm French, so I fried my own in garlic butter(lol). Did need extra milk. Reviews helped. Yummy! Definitely make it again.

This recipe is awesome.  This was my first homemade tuna casserole and it turned out so very tasty.  I doubled the tuna and added a can of cream of mushroom with garlic and a can of mushroom pieces to the original recipe, as well as about 1/3 cup milk and spices to our taste.  We used garlic and onion powders, paprika, cayenne, pepper and dried dill.  This is a really great casserole, so easy to make and sooo delicious.  YUMMY!  Thanks Lindsay!

I too add an extra can of tuna and an extra can of cream of whatever soup.  I've made it w/ cream of celery, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken (always using 1 cream of chicken).  I don't use as much cheese as suggested and it always turns out delicious.

This was good & very simple. Only thing I did different was that I added a some garlic powder & about a 1/2 cup of sour cream to make the base a bit creamier. It was quite good & couldn't be much simpler to prepare!

Another good comfort food staple.  This is the only tuna casserole recipe I use.  I used 1 can cream of chicken healthy request soup, 2 cans of tuna, added about 3/4 can of milk, frozen peas, a can of well drained mushrooms, and diced roasted red bell pepper.  I agree is was a little bland so I added salt, black peppar, and onion powder to taste.  I love the fried onions on top.  Don't typically use the cheese, but it's okay with it.  It's great, and super easy.

I thought this recipe was okay with the changes that others have suggested of adding mayo and garlic powder.  My husband really liked it and went for seconds.  I will make it again for him, but I don't know if I will eat it again.

I can not believe how easy and good this recipe is!  My husband and I absolutely love it!  He is constantly asking me when I am making it again.  Even without the fried onions it's delicious.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I am a cheese lover, so I added a bit more cheese. The french fried onions make it wonderful. Will make again.

This is a great base recipe for a favorite comfort food. My whole family loved it. I cut the amount of noodles down to fit three people, but kept the other ingredients the same with the addition (per other reviews) of a little garlic powder and mayonaise. It was great. Thanks!

I can't really rate this recipe as is, because I made it with such varied proportions, but I think that it's a great basic recipe to have on hand. A helpful note: I used Italian style breadcrumbs, moistened with butter, instead of french onions, and that automatically provided all the seasonings I need. I sprinkled it on before putting it into the oven, on top of the cheese, and let it cook.

The best tuna casserole I've come across. I added and extra can of tuna, half a can of milk, and on can of cream of mushroom soup. Definitely needed seasonings - garlic, mustard powder and basil. Next time I will add onions too.

I made this casserole for myself, and my mother. We both thought that It was great! I too used both cream of celery, and chicken soup. I also used fresh onions, and a little bit of garlic powder and pepper. It turned out excellent, and Im sure that I will make it again!

Well, what can I say.  It's yummy. I don't know what I was expecting.  I guess something really really yummy.  There just wasn't anything that made it "special".  I should have known this from looking at the ingredients, but after reading all the great reviews you start to think "hmmmm...this many people can't be wrong".  Like I said, it's yummy and everyone especially kids will like it.  It's just not a "WOW!" recipe.  I think you can make any casserole with cream soup, meat, rice or noodles, and a veggie all combined together.  On a side note...I made sure to add a lot of soup so that it wouldn't turn  out dry.  I also added more tuna.

four stars for how easy and tasty it was... what I liked about it is that it IS a good base, and even for the cooking inepts like me, I could make some additions without messing it up.  I added some milk, about 4 times as much tuna as it called for, and a can of peas and carrots.  My boyfriend who made a face when I said I was making tuna casserole went back for seconds!

What a great quick comfort meal.  I used rotini pasta and after boiling it, I only had two cups cooked - perfect.  I used 2 cans of solid white tuna, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, about 1/2 cup of milk to make it a little creamier, topped with sliced American cheese (ran out of cheddar).

The tuna casserole turned out too dry. The recipe should have called for 2 cans of soup. Overall, it tasted very bland. It needed something more.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars for original recipe.  5 stars with modification.  I used 2 cans of soup and extra milk if needed.  Original recipe was to dry.  I also added frozen peas and spices to give it extra kick.  Thanks Lindsay, my kids and neighbor kids loved it with 3 helpings each!

Loved This! I had never made a tuna casserole before and was VERY worried about baking tuna.  But this was great.  My boyfriend even asked me to put this in our dinner time rotation.  I also used the Cheddar type of fried onions for even more cheesiness!

Instead of macaroni, I used egg noodles.  I also added a can of peas and cream of mushroom soup.  I used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for.  As for the tuna, I used one can but that wasn't enough.  Next time I'll use two and a half cans and give the other half of one can to my cat.

Nice easy recipe.  I used tri-colored pasta for color.  Also, I used 2 cans (vice 1) Cream of Chicken and Herb for more flavoring.  With the two cans, it was more creamy!  Yummy!  Instead of French Fried Onions, I sautéed a whole onion and put in the mixture before baking.  I also added fresh ground pepper and a can of corn.  It was simple and my family really enjoyed it!  Will do again.

Fine if you have a big family to feed but a little tuny for "adult" taste.

I jazzed this up a bit and my son & I loved it - hubby, who hates fish, was thoroughly disgusted.  I sauted half an onion and a cup of chopped celery in a little butter, mixed in cream of mushroom and cream of celery with a little milk, some cajun spice and about a cup of sour cream.  Layered this sauce with the macaroni and cheese. I skipped the onions on top - thought about using some potato chips next time.(I doubled the recipe - wish I hadn't as hubby won't eat the left-overs)

This needs one more can of soup and more tuna.  I used the bigger size than called for anyway and my husband still said it needed more tuna...So next time with one more can of soup and maybe one big and one small can of tuna.  Definitely will make again though...it was very easy!!

When I made this it was dry.  Still tasty, we ate it all anyway.  I'll make it again and tweak it a little!

This recipe turned out pretty bad.  I took the advice of the others to double certain ingredients.  It still came out pretty badly.  It didn't really have any flavor and was really dry.  I will not make this again.
