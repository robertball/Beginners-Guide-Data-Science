I make a similar dish--I use less lemon juice, another can of chicken stock, a can of diced tomatoes, half an onion-diced, along with alot of garlic, adobo, and my favorite blend of seasoning...Very delicious! You can use anykind of pasta-rotini, bow ties, penne, doesnt work well with spaghetti though. I love this because its a ONE POT DISH!!!  Check out my pic.

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, my husband and I aren't that big on pasta. But it was VERY good! I cut the recipe in half (as there's just the two of us) but used the full amount of garlic. I also added carrots, sun dried tomatoes, and lemon pepper. The lemon juice may be a bit strong if you don't normally like it, but my husband "hates" lemon and LOVED this pasta. I will definitely be making again.

It was good but too much lemon juice in the recipe for my taste.  i think it would be better if there was less lemon juice maybe just 1/4 cup.

I was looking for a quick, easy and tasty meal using ingredients I already had and this recipe provided me with just that. I didn't have chicken broth so I used beef broth and it still came out great! I also added about 1/2 cup of of frozen corn for color. Thank you Seaside!!

Fabulous!! Made it just as recipe said.  Everyone in the family loved it and wanted seconds (5 of us).  I think it is the first time my son ate all his broccoli and asked for more with out complaining once!  Thank you for sharing.

Made this as written and ended up eating most all of it on my own.  Not a recipe that will blow someone away or even have them asking for seconds.  Going to search for better ways to use fresh broccoli.

This was very easy to make. It had too much lemon for some family members, but I loved the lemoniness. Next time I may add more broccoli and perhaps some other vegetables too, like sauteed mushrooms and red peppers. Used veggie broth instead of chicken broth to make the recipe vegetarian friendly. Thanks!

This was O.K. Next time I will use half the lemon juice, double the Parmesan cheese, and double the broccoli. I added about a teaspoon or two of basil.  To sum it up, it's just okay.

Personally my husband and I didn't care for that amount of lemon in the dish. I would had cut that to half they said to put in.

I made this tonight basically according to recipe. I did use less lemon and more garlic. I also used tri- color rotini to entice my 4 year old grandson who only likes pasta with “red” sauce. He ate 3 helpings! Everyone else enjoyed it as well!

This was good, light and tasty. But it definitely needed more broccoli and less olive oil.

Wayyyyyyyy too much lemon juice. Holy moly. I couldn't even eat it due to the lemon taste. My husband referred to it as lemon war head pasta. It may be better with less lemon juice but I won't be giving it another try.

an easy and original side dish. I thought it might be a bit bland, it wasn't very flavourful, and highlights the noodle.

I wanted to like it but I followed the recipe exactly and it had waaayyyyh to much lemon juice in it. Came out tasting like salad. I always try to follow a recipe perfectly before I tweak it but this one is gonna need some changes in the measurements in order for it to be a good stand alone. Plus I have picky school age eaters.

I just made it and there's WAY too much pasta... only 1/2 of a 16 oz box of rotini would be needed here, but I followed the recipe and used the entire box, not realizing til the skillet was overflowing that there was too much (and I used my huge skillet!). Didn't want to waste it so added more brocolli and parmesan.
