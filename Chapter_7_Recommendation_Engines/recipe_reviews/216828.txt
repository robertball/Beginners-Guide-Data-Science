Great recipe and a great way to dress up a box of brownie mix by adding the quick addition of a creamy cheesecake type mixture. So simple and so delicious - what more could you ask for from such an easy recipe? I made sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheesecakes and added a cup of mini chocolate chips to make this even more decadent. This definitely takes regular brownies to another level of deliciousness with only a few ingredients.  Have a cold glass of milk on hand 'cause you're gonna need it!

An easy comfort dessert.  I've made variations of cream cheese brownies before, but I like that this version has a little vanilla.  To get a better swirl effect, it's easier to layer most of the brownie batter, pour the cream cheese mixture over that, and then layer the remaining brownie batter over the top before swirling.

These taste ok. It’s a easy and quick process.  I used the knife to make swirls however it did not work. Most of the cream cheese was on top. Next time I will mix everything together.

I've made these boxed brownie cheesecake things a couple of times in the past and each time I did I swore, "Never again."  I apparently have a short memory because I tried them again. What did I think would be different?  Once again, I didn't like these at all; in fact, I didn't keep them.  Too gooshy.  "Never again."

I opted to make brownies from scratch using the "Best Brownies" recipe from AR. Only baked for 20mins based on the other recipe's baking time frame and still turned out alright. I only had 4oz-ish of cream cheese and made it work. My boys will be pleasantly surprised when they home!

I followed the recipe except to use regular chocolate chips instead of chunks.  I didn't think they were anything wonderful but the folks at DH's work ate them up.  I'll probably make them again for the same reason.

Fabulous, I made this 3 times in a week for different occasions. It was a hit every time. So easy to make and in the oven baking within 5-10 minutes. I sprinkled chocolate chips and crushed pecans over the too just prior to baking.

These were really good.  I used Giradelli Chocolate Brownie mix and forgot to add the sugar to the cream cheese mixture, but it was still very sweet and very good.  I did add mini chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture.  Will make these again.

I had some unopened cream cheese leftover from an aborted attempted to make cheesecake; I needed to use it before expiration and this was the easiest thing I could find.  

Very simple and a great way to dress up regular box brownies.  I've swirled cream cheese brownies before, but this time around it didn't swirl quite right...I think I'll try another reviewers suggestion and layer the brownie mix w/ the cream cheese next time.

*sigh* I tried.  I don't know what it is.  I admit it was my first time making brownies - I think.  I picked one of the boxed brownies at the store.  It turns out I picked the 18 oz and not the 19.8 oz.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it but it just wouldn't bake all the way.  I thought since it's a smaller box maybe it would bake faster.  Not the case.  I had it in the oven for 50 minutes and the middle was still wet.  I didn't want to keep it in the oven longer because I was worried that the edges were going to be like a brick.  Maybe I should have kept it in there longer.  The flavor tasted fine - the brownie part the cheesecake part and the swirled part.  It just didn't bake all the way through.  I'm not sure I would try this again.

Made these for my fiance's birthday. He LOVED them!! He devoured them..as well as my cousin(sneaky one that). Alot of them went missing when I wasn't around. Followed the recipe exactly no problems. Thanks, it is definitely a keeper. Side note: use a tooth-pick for swirling

I made these for Mother's day and they were delicious! I made the brownie batter without a mix. I followed the recipe exactly, it took awhile to get some lumps out, but I did get them out. :) Instead of putting it in to the batter tablespoon by tablespoon, I cheated a little and poured it in all at once, then swirled it around and I got more swirls than some other reviews did, it is a time saver! 
It's got a crispy layer on the outside, and rich and moist on the inside. It's not too cake-y, not too fudgy, it's a perfect balance. 
Anyway, I am definitely going to make these again, and I recommend these to other viewers as well :D

I didn't like this recipe. I thought it had a wierd texture and was kind of flat. felt like the cream cheese mixture was a waste of time becuase it didn't add any flavor. Won't make this one again.

Made these for Thanksgiving.  So easy to make which was a plus since I was getting over a stomach bug and had no energy.  Will definitely make again but next time I will make sure I get the cheesecake part to a good golden brown.  Mine were just getting brown on the edges which made the brownies in the middle a bit underdone.

substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil on brownie mix.  
substituted Stevia in the the raw for  sugar on cream cheese mixture.    Turned out great!

Only thing I’d change is that I’d make two brownie mixes to one cream cheese mixture!  My family LOVED THEM!!!

Our go to recipe for cream cheese brownies.  Sometimes I make the fudge brownies, sometimes the cake like brownies (only difference is 1 egg).  Great every time!  First dessert gone whenever I take them to a potluck gathering.

It was good! I should have doubled my batch of brownies (did not want to run to the store for a mix, so did homemade), but that did not affect how awesome these were! Also, I used the size pan required for the brownies, not the 13x9 it calls for here (totally spaced & missed that), so they took longer to cook. However, 100% will make again and will do it correctly! Ha ha! They were amazing like it was, I can only imagine if I do it correctly!

I made this recipe with my favorite brownie mix (Betty Crocker Milk Chocolate) and added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a cup of chopped walnuts. I also added mini-chips to the cream cheese mixture. I like to serve these refrigerated . Very fudgy and delicious!

I took these Brownies to my daughter's house. Dessert is usually my job when we have dinner together. My husband had to sample them before we left. His response was to tell me to leave some of them home because they were....Really good! My daughter ate two and planned to have one with coffee the next morning. The only thing I did different was to sprinkle walnuts, chocolate chips and some white chocolate chips. They were moist, chewy and delicious.
