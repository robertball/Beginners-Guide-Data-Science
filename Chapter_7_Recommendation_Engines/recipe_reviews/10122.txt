while this recipe was delicious, the directions leave much to be desired.
It didnt say how thick to roll it out so I made it 1/4 inch.
I found the dough to be sticky and hard to roll, I would suggest pressing half of the mix onto the pan in the shape you want, leaving an edge that rises slightly the whole way around, try to keep your sugar from going outside the edge, and cover completly with second half of mix.
Any sugar that is uncovered during the cooking process will be grainy and unmelted.
The recipe didnt say what to do with the almond slices, so I sprinkled them on top. I also had to cook it longer than suggested.

My mother made these years ago from a magazine recipe.  They were the best, moist cookie that I ever had.  But, the recipe was lost.  I am so thrilled to find it here.  Thank you!

Very yummy!  I added more almond flavor to the sugar and a little to the batter mixture.  It made for more almond flavor.  Also, I treated it like a pie and folded over crust and pressed together so sugar didn't leak out.  Over all  yummy easy recipe.  Would def. make again!  Thanks :)

Pretty tasty little treat!  The dough is not something you can really roll out, so I patted mine pretty thin using my hands.  The directions do not say when to use the almonds, so I sprinkled some in with the sugar filling and the rest on the top layer prior to baking.  These taste like an almond shortbread with subtle almond flavor.

I am a shortbread almond croissant lover (and had some cream cheese that needed to be used) so I made these for a Christmas cookie swap. The taste is 5 stars but challenging to roll out. I tried rolling, hand patting ....sticky wicket. Finally I rolled out onto a heavily floured countertop and then cut the rectangle into 3” strips. With a spatula I lifted the strips onto the cookie sheet, otherwise they would have fallen apart. 
One other change was I put 1/2 of the sugar mixture into the dough. I just didn’t like the idea of no sweetness in the shortbread part of this dish. I think I would make again now that I’ve figured out how to transfer the dough. Good luck 

YUMMY!
