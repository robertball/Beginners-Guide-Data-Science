I stumbled across this recipe and was a little unsure of whether I wanted to make it or not. Three months later, I finally have and I wish I would have done it sooner! I adapted it to fit my taste (no onion, mcintosh apples, bacon, and honey dijon mustard).It was incredibly easy and even the picky members of the family loved it. I would really recommend adding the bacon!

This is a wonderful lite meal. I think I will probably add a few more green onions next time. I used smoked gouda and it was wonderful. This recipe is a definite keeper!

A great and innovative recipe but I would probably leave out the mustard which I found overwhelming and change the simple Gouda to a stronger cheese like the goat's milk gouda Arina or Fontina.

One word: Bland.  This was not good I won't make it again, it lacked flavour.

This was a very different recipe. It was easy to make (8 yr. old helped make them) and extremely quick to put together. Very tasty. This is a great recipe if you are looking for something a little different for the everyday quesadillas.

First I grilled the quesadilla following the recipe exactly.  I had a hard time getting the finish on it that I wanted, so finally I transferred it to a pan, which worked much better.  I probably would have liked a Granny Smith apple better, and I kept wanting something sweet/spicy on it (maybe because it's on a tortilla!), like a mango salsa.  Thanks for the idea of this because it opens up lots of new ideas for me!

Wonderful recipe!  Tasty and hearty and filling, but be sure to use plenty of oil on the outside of the tortillas so they don't stick to the grill!  Great suggestion to add chicken for non-vegetarians.

Recipe was very bland with no flavor punch.  The apples become very mushy and taste like applesauce.  This may be better with cinnamon sugar.

i was looking to use up some smoked gouda and decided to give this recipe a try. it was delicious! i was cooking for one, so i just used a single whole wheat tortilla folded in half. i used maybe a third of a granny smith apple and half a green onion. cooked it in a regular pan sprayed with cooking spray. definitely a keeper!

Used honey mustard instead of dijon (all we had). Simple recipe, but good. Not a fancy night on the town meal, just a good quickie meal.

This won't be something I'll make all the time, but it was an interesting recipe.  I used smoked Gouda and added bacon like other reviewers.  I also mixed a little honey butter with the Dijon mustard to help counter some of the mustard's intensity (really glad I did, it still came out pretty strong).  I used the Foreman propped open to make this on its highest setting using the cooking times indicated, which seemed to work well.  My brother and fiance had the same reaction to these I did: these quesadillas are kind of good and definitely interesting if you're looking for something different, but not something to put into regular meal rotation.

Delicious- gourmet taste without much work. I added fresh white corn and we loved it-- though it didn't hold together that well (more cheese next time?). Next: we'll be adding bacon/flavored sausage and smoked gouda for a twist. Thanks for the great recipe & suggestions from reviewers!

As someone who is gluten-free, I used corn tortillas instead. Instead of green onions, I mixed a drizzle of maple syrup into the mustard and spread on with the back of the spoon first. Then I layered cooked turkey bacon, thin apple slices and some shredded gouda on top. Sandwiched between two corn tortillas, heated in a hot cast iron pan over medium heat til cheese was melted - DELICIOUS! Cut into 4 slices to serve and garnish with remaining apple slices and some parsley or other green.

made this as stated except omitted the onions.  Love the idea, but too weird for us.  I'll try 'dillas on the grill, but with more traditional filling.

I make these with brie cheese which complements the apples perfectly. I often add some smoked turkey as well. It's a quick lunch or light dinner.

I added honey to my mustard and still found it very mustardy and overpowering the fantastic flavor of the gouda and apples.  I couldn't imagine how strong the mustard flavor would have been having not adding the honey.  Great idea but I would leave out the mustard all together in this.

I loved this idea, however I tried the recipe with green apples and sharp cheddar cheese instead of the red apples and gouda. It was delicious! Going to try the original next time :)

My mother recently visited an Amish Cheese Factory and brought back lots of different types of cheese.  We made this with fresh made Amish gouda and they were delicious!  We would (and have) make these again.

Loved it!!  Use firm apples.  I like Fuji Apples myself and will try them next time with the onions (did not have any green onions).  I did use sliced Gouda and it worked fine.

I was not sure my husband would like this, but it was a hit!  You can adjust ingredients to taste.  Adding shredded chicken may give the recipe a little change up.  Thanks for a nice variation on quesadillas!

Absolutely delicious!! We used a smoked Gouda (grated is a must!) and a gala apple with a mesquite smoked turkey..... We will do this one over and over again!

I made this with a few modifications and loved it!  Based on prior reviews, I left off the Dijon mustard, thinking it could be added when served if we wanted it, and I used a small amount of diced white onions instead of green onions since that is what I had on hand. At the last minute, I chopped up a cup of sliced deli ham & added it, which was delicious. The smoky, salty taste paired perfectly with the sweet & tart apple flavor. Thanks for a great dish!
