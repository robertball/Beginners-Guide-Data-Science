I might add some garlic and herbs next time to boost the flavor, but overall this was a hit with my whole family.

This was a disappointment. Too dry overall. I used my own organic pasta, but, cooked it as required in the recipe (cooking the liquid down). When I added the red sauce & all other ingredients it was drier than I’d expected.  The 1-1/2 cups of chicken was not enough to even show among the pasta so I added another cup of it.  If I was to make it again I’d definitely be making some changes!

The dish was very tasty, I used leftover BBQ'd chicken.  I only had one problem and I didn't see anyone else mention it.  When was I suppose to use the extra virgin olive oil?  I have looked through the recipe instructions several times and I still didn't see when to add the olive oil.

I made this as directed, for the most part, and it was a hit! I cubed chicken breasts, seasoned heavily with garlic powder and Italian seasonings and sauteed with butter and evoo. The dish will definitely be made again. Great for those what-should-I-make-for-dinner nights!

I didn't follow the instructions on how to cook the pasta because I was scared of them.  Otherwise, I did follow the instructions, other than having to cook my own chicken.  This was pretty easy and pretty tasty.

Taste yummy! I added butter, basil and a little sugar. Needed way more water to soften the noodles then what the recipe called for. Taste yummy and family liked it. Also used shredded chicken from a rotisserie.

This dish is fantastic!   So easy to make. I will definitely be making this again.  I added sautéed onions and garlic to this dish.

Really easy and really yummy! I used chicken breast. Cut it into chunks and cooked it before adding. I can see how rotisserie chicken would be yummier now though (and I added seasonings to the chicken for flavour). Will make it again!
