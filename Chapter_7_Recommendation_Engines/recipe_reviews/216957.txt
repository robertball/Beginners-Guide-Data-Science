Fantastic!  I cooked the ribs an hour longer but started on 300 and raised it an hour in.  Delicious!  Rave reviews from my guests.

I made this recipe with pork baby back ribs, exactly per instructions.  I thought the root beer marinade sounded interesting.  We did like the ribs; the flavor was good, but not wonderful.  They actually had much less flavor of the sesame oil and other marinade ingredients than I expected--I would have preferred ore lavor.  As it was, hey mostly tasted just ike ribs.   I may make them again--mine turned out a little dry, but I believe that was because the rack of ribs I used did not have much of a fat layer.  I would recommend them to any rib lover.  Thank you, Chef John.
