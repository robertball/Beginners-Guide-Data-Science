I too set out to get a recipe for "from scratch" ice cream, but why not skip that whole ice cream base process which basically yields vanilla ice cream. This recipe gives you a verrry pumpkin flavor. I added a package of cream cheese to tone it down a tiny bit and crushed graham crackers to give it that pumpkin cheesecake taste.

I originally wanted a recipe for making pumpkin ice cream from scratch, but this is much easier.  It's like getting more & healthier ice cream than you started out with!  I skipped the cookie layers - the ice cream is excellent alone!

I used ginger snaps instead of nilla wafers, it was delicious.

Amazing!  I crushed the cookies in the bottom and then dumped all the ice cream on top!  I would definetly recommend this recipe, it is very easy to make ahead of time and just take out of the freezer and serve!

This was pretty good.  All I had was a 30oz can of pumpkin pie mix so I omitted the spices and ended up adding a little more pumpkin than it said.  I used the remaining pumpkin in a simple syrup to pour over the top.  I didn't layer it with the cookies or anything and just refroze it and scooped it up.  I'll make this again for holidays.

This is not for everyone - but for those who like the taste of fall -- SO GOOD. I used gingersnaps and did one batch with a quality vanilla ice cream and the other with a European walnut ice cream. The walnut ice cream was by far the favorite of the more gourmet tastebuds - i think the vanilla made it a bit too sweet.

This recipe was amazing! It tasted like pumpkin pie and it had a lovely texture! I omitted the nuts and wafers (I don't like wafers and my sisters don't like nuts) and I'm actually really glad I did. This would be a great dessert for Halloween or Thanksgiving or even Christmas!

This was a delicious treat. I took it to a dinner party and everyone really like it. I made a few changes though, for the ginger snaps - I used Speculaas - b/c that is what we have that is similar here in Holland. Also, I couldn't find any pecans so I used walnut ice cream in place of the vanilla - that helped cut down on the cost side, too. I'd make this again - it was very good. I did half the recipe - and that came to about 1/2 liter of ice cream in case anyone is wondering. Also, I think it would be a good idea to skip the cookies and just put it in a pre-baked cookie pie crust and top it with whipped cream. Excellent!

This was delicious! I used ginger snaps and followed the recipe exact.  It is great for potluck dinners because it makes a lot.  Plus it was nice to have something different, that not many people have tried before.  Would definately make again!

My family did not like this. :(  For us it was too many textures going on (crunchy pecans, softer cookies, creamy ice cream) and the pumpkin flavor was overwhelming.

Delicious!  I didn't add the  cookies, ground ginger or pecans only because I didn't have any on hand.  I crumble gingersnap cookies on top of my bowl. Yummy.

I cut the recipe in half as this wouldn't transport well to send home w/ my kids. I too, used ginger snaps & think they are a must to the recipe. Vanilla wafers wouldn't add the same zing.  I used a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices...very yummy & perfect for a warmish fall day. Thansk  Kristine!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I did not try it with the vanilla wafers yet because I just wanted to see what the ice cream tasted like on its own first, and I omitted the pecans because I'm allergic.  The only minor advice I have is watch your ginger.  If you are using a less potent quality brand such as McCormick (and I'm not knocking McCormick by all means, I love their spices, but as you've probably noticed their spices are a bit "generic") the full 1 teaspoon should be fine.  I, however, was using Penzeys Spices which are more potent and think the ginger *almost* overtook the flavor, so I think it could have been cut to 3/4 tsp or 1/2 tsp.  Also just wanted to clearly mention that yes, your ice cream will be soup after you make the recipe so plan for a few hours to get a good re-freeze to it.  Great recipe though and hard to keep your spoon out of the ice cream carton after it's done before you eat it all by yourself, hehe!

I made this, not sure if I was doing it right, but after letting it re freeze in the freezer I tried it and it was delicious (it tastes just like pumpkin pie)! My friends loved it as well, and it is definitely going on the desert list for this years Halloween party

Delicious and easy!!  Instead of canned pumpkin, I used fresh pumpkin.  It's very easy--slice, then bake the pumpkin for 35 minutes (or until the pumpkin is soft) at 375 degrees (F) in a small amount of water.  Scoop the flesh out, then puree with an immersion blender or food processor.  I used the same amount of fresh pumpkin (15 oz).

I first made this 4 years ago for a dessert contest at work and won the "golden spoon!"  Since then, I've had several request each year to bring it back.  Very easy!  I use gingersnaps and walnuts and mix with Blue Bell, if you can get it.

Great recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving along with the crackle top molasses cookies from this site, which I absolutely love.  I was about to give it a four star rating because of the nilla wafers... doesn't sound appetizing... but other than that, the recipe is simple and delicious.  I used less sugar than called for and served the cookies a la mode.  Yum!  Best Thanksgiving dessert ever!

I made multiple substitutions but appreciated the concept and enjoyed the final result.  Instead of all of the spices, I followed someone else's suggestion and used 1 T. pumpkin pie spice.  That might have been a little too much so next time I might try instead 2 t.  Also, some of the spices rose to the top and made the first serving far too spicy.  I used 15 oz. of fresh cooked and frozen pumpkin, frozen yogurt instead of ice cream, candied the pecans, and didn't use vanilla wafers.

I made this in the Fall. I changed the recipe by using lactose free vanilla ice cream instead of regular vanilla ice cream. I did not change anything else. It made enough for 5 people to eat for a week. I was worried it would not set up but it eventually froze and was very smooth.

Perfect for the season! This super easy recipe was very tasty.  I put the full cup of sugar but might use just half a cup next time.

I made this last night and served it at a brunch this AM.  I used the ginger snaps and I was on the phone when I was making it so I forgot to mix the pecans in the ice cream so I just sprinkled them on top. Very Delicious.

Very good!  Just made ice cream without nuts for another end-use recipe. Just as good as premium pumpkin ice cream, though that is probably dependent on the quality of base ice cream you start with. I did use far less sugar - about 3/8 cup.

I will first off admit I tweaked the recipe to ingredients I had on hand. I used canned pumpkin, vanilla ice cream, pumpkin pie spice, Starbucks gingerbread syrup, maple syrup to taste and omitted the sugar, nuts and cookies.  I folded the pumpkin in enough to make a more swirled appearance. I served in a mini graham cracker crust and sprinkled crumbs on top. Very good! The original recipe has inspired me to do some other concoctions!

Had to make something of pumpkin taste for my sons kindergarten class and I wanted something different than the usual cookies and pie.What kid doesn't like ice cream? Made some for the family to try first and it was a huge hit! Hoping it's just as big for his class tomorrow. Super easy to make and tastes soo good!

If you're a fan of pumpkin pie, you are gonna love this recipe! I took it to a church gathering, and I would overhear people say "what is this?". I must confess I am leery of food I don't recognize also. Everyone who tried it, loved it. It is amazingly yummy!
