yay my first recipe to be published!! using my personal recipe for black pepper onion rings (in my recipe box) and the carmelized onion rings (described in the intro) reall makes this delcious. i suggest everyone try it this way! who can go wrong with caramelized onions? and i forgot to note that traditionally some of the vinegar (i actually use tarragon vinegar) from the chick peas is sprinkled on the food.. :)

A friend of mine went to Egypt a few years ago and still will not shut up about Koshari, so, I had to give this a try.  I admit, I was a little skeptical.  A tomato sauce over chickpeas, lentils, rice AND pasta??  It sounded like a bland, starchy mess to me. 

I was WRONG!  What a great dish!  Healthy, flavorful, filling and inexpensive.  I eat meat, but you are right, Nooney, I did not miss it here.  Per my friend's suggestion, I also topped off my Koshari with Tabasco and a bit of fresh lime juice.  

Thank you for the recipe!!

I really enjoyed this, so did my son. My husband didn’t care for it but he really doesn’t like lentils.  He did try it still, and he said he liked the top part – the pasta with the tomato & fried onion toppings.  I’m glad I made it.  There are a lot of steps to the recipe but I like making involved recipes from time to time.  The only thing I made different was I use brown basmati rice and that cooks longer but we love that rice – and we use brown rice & whole wheat pasta only but the pasta doesn’t usually change the flavor very much.  I was worried to fry the rice in butter, I thought it was going to burn but it worked out just fine.  I’ve had koshary before, a Filipino coworker made it once for a potluck and I’ve been curious about the recipe ever since. This was different from hers, but not very different.  The recipe makes a lot too.  I especially liked the chickpea ‘condiment’ part of the recipe, that flavor was really good and had a nice little kick to it.

Amazing! I am known amongst my friends to ruin a bowl of cereal so i took a big leap attempting this. I got frustrated one or 2 times, but it ended up turning out wonderful!! everyone couldn't stop talking about what a yummy and different dish this was. I used your recipe for the fried onion rings and made extra of the other onions, they were fantastic! We made the vinegar and chick peas extra hot and it gave a great kick to the dish. Thanks for the great recipe

I made this dish with a side of naan bread.  It was wonderful!  I did make some adjustments - omitted pasta, butter and fried onions, used red lentils instead of brown, increased vinegar to 1/2 cup, increased spices, added chickpeas to tomato mix and simmered together, used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, seasoned rice and lentils with cumin and red pepper flakes. Fantastic vegetarian dish!

Great recipe with all the essentials. It takes a long time so what I do is cook the rice, garbanzos & lentils ahead of time. I freeze them together and then when I'm ready to make the red sauce I thaw them and it only takes like 1/2 hour from there. I use rice pasta because I'm gluten-free. You other reviewers, you can't have koshari without the pasta!!! I don't marinate the chickpeas.  I add vinegar and tomato paste to the red sauce to make it better.

Absolutely amazing.  I made plain brown rice in my rice cooker and stirred in some butter and Better than Bouillon when it was done.  I also added a little Better than Bouillon to the tomato sauce.  I used 1/2 teaspoon cayenne in the chickpeas so my kids wouldn't complain, and they had a gentle heat.  I didn't think there were enough noodles, chickpeas, and tomato sauce to add to the lentils and rice.  I would double the chickpeas and noodles, and double or even triple the tomato sauce next time.  Makes a ton, but I was happy because I got to eat the leftovers for lunch all week!

Takes a long time to prepare but delicious!! I was out of garbanzos so I used the smaller chickpeas. Delicious overall. Loved the onions, I put the two kinds in a 500 degrees F oven.

I was doubtful as I cooked this recipe that I was going to like it. But it was wonderful. I didn't have any french fried onions to put on it, but I grilled up some onion and zucchini and it turned out just great.

This recipe is delicious!  I used to live in Egypt, and this recipe is a winner.  Followed all directions to a T, except for adding just a little more garlic to the tomatoes.  It was a hit with the husband and with my finicky child as well!  I highly recommend it.  Great meatless meal.

Koshari is know as 'a poor man's dish' in the Middle East.  I had it all the time while I was living there and it was one of my favorites.  Like many 'European' comfort foods we all grew up eating, this one is sure to please everyone.  Thanks for the recipe and the memory.

Excellent!  I omited the pasta, but otherwise stuck fairly close to the recipe.  I also seasoned it a little more heavily, but the results where delicious. The chickpeas have a really nice zing to them after marinating.

In a word - YUCK!  I would not feed this to my dog.  Took about 3 bites and then dumped it.  After reading all the positive reviews I had expectations that this would be really good - It wasn't.  It took a long time to make and it was Soooo not worth it.  The main dish was bland and tasteless.  The chick pea marinade was just plain weird and seemed totally out of place with the rice / pasta.  I normally don't write bad reviews but I'm trying to save someone else the trouble of making this awful dish.

This recipe was easy to make. I made it for my son's class at the request of the teacher to have the kids taste traditional Egyptian food.  I looked up what Koshary was first and found this recipe to have all the parts of the dish.  Since then, I have made this again for our family.  I only used half the amount of cayenne pepper and that gave it just enough kick.

I added additional spice to my lentils, and I wish I would have been more heavy-handed with those: cardamom pods, bay leaf, peppercorn.  I used tomato sauce instead of puree, turned out great... I think next time I would double the tomato proportion, as my Egyptian friend tells me that the tomato sauce is the key to this dish.  I didn't do the fried onions.  Loved it!

I made up all the elements then used 1/3 cup each of lentils, elbows, rice, and sauce per serving. Added a little more garlic to the sauce. By the end of the meal dd proclaimed this a winner and asked to have it for lunch the next day. Will use the submitter suggested caramelized onions next time as neither of us were wild about the canned onions. Served with steamed cauli  sprinkled with Dukkah.

It takes more than 2 hours to make this recipe! I lived in Egypt sometime ago, and as part of an International Day at my daughter school, we were ask to bring a dish to the pot luck, I made koshery for the very first time in my life.  Delicious!

I loved it. My husband didn't like it all but he has not sense of adventure.  I sent some leftovers to my neighbors who also enjoyed it.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I used brown rice and also added some fresh chopped cilantro on top.

Lentils were too bland, added spices to them, also added spices to tomato sauce. 1 and 1/2 cup dry lentils way too much for 2 people and out of proportion to the sauce.

I made this with my own veg broth, and instead of red wine vinegar I used balsamic.  I also used barley instead of rice. I only changed ingredients because that was what i had on hand.  Oh and instead of cayenne I used turmeric It all turned out great. Thanks for the idea.

The recipe is a little bland compared to other Koshary dishes I've tried. The tomato sauce is missing some spice. I recommend adding cumin, coriander and chili in the tomato sauce.

My family loved it. I used frozen onion rings, but did everything else as the recipe states.

Delicious!  My one recommendation would be to double the chickpea/vinegar mixture and double the tomato mixture if you're serving them as individual toppings, because we ran out of both when people were serving themselves.

Very good. Way too much lentils though. And this only made 4 servings. 
About the rice, it depends on your rice, but mine (long grained egyptian rice) takes 7 minutes to be done after I put the lid on. The trick with the rice is that it should be filled with just enough water to slightly cover the rice (just a few millimeters). Too much and it gets mushy. 20 Minutes may be too long in most cases, burning the rice. Check on it after 10 minutes, but don't take the lid off more than once though.

 Never make this without the pasta, that's the main ingredient really.

This a great recipe.  I especially loved the marinated chickpeas and sauce.
