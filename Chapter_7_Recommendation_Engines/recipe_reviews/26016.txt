This cake is very delicious, moist, and not to mention absolutely beautiful. The tartness of the cranberries, the crunchiness of the nuts, and sweetness of the gooey topping complement each other extremely well. I did make adjustments though.For the topping ingredients, I chose to chop a few of the cranberries in half so it would cover the bottom of the pan more evenly. I used a mix of crumbled pecans, walnuts, and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds instead of using only pecans. I didn't have enough sour cream to fill 1 cup, so I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup vanilla yogourt which worked just as well. I used an 8" springform pan, and because it is slightly smaller in diameter compared to the average 9" pan that most people used, I knew I had to increase the baking time a little bit. Also, according to some reviews, 60min was not long enough to fully bake the cake, and 350 degrees was too high. From this info, I baked my cake at 325 degrees for around 75-80min and it came out perfect and even. For this cake, I'd definitely recommend using a pan no bigger than 9" because it's a pretty short cake. In the future I will continue using an 8" or maybe even a 7" pan. For me, this cake took quite a bit of prep and baking time, but it's definitely worth the trouble and wait. When serving, I decorated each slice with a light sprinkle of toasted coconut, and a dallop of whipped cream on the side.

I cannot believe I did rate this recipe. Everyone loved it. My aunt made it with walnuts and she said it was delicious. I didn't change anything in the recipe, and it was great. My husband did ask for a little more cranberries next time though. I always wrap the springform pan in alum. paper and set it on a pan. I also found that putting a square of parchment paper at the bottom of the pan (bigger so that the edges are outside the pan in between the bottom and the round) prevent any leakage.

This cake looks very impressive!!!  I give it five stars for its appearance and four stars for its taste.  I say just forget about wrapping the springform pan in foil.  My foil sprung a leak!  It would be much better to slip a foil-lined cookie sheet under the pan itself.  Much easier and more foolproof.

There is no reason to use a springform pan for any upside down cake.  Use a cake pan which should be heavily buttered bottom only, not the sides. After baking let sit 5 minutes (not 10) then run a knife around cake. Place serving plate upside down on cake pan and invert.  It is a great recipe except for the spring form pan, but I knew better, thank goodness.  Just had to let other cooks know too.

Wow!  What a beautiful and delicious coffee cake - perfect for the Christmas holiday season.  I followed the batter part exactly, but for the topping I used 1/2 c. of butter, a 12 oz. bag of cranberries, 3/4 c. of nuts (you could use walnuts or pecans) and a little more than 2/3 c. of tightly packed brown sugar.  I didn't bother using a saucepan to boil the butter and brown sugar, I just used a microwave safe bowl to melt the butter and then added the brown sugar.  I put a cookie sheet under the foil lined spring form pan and it took a little longer to bake - about 70 minutes.  I drizzled the top with melted white chocolate - mmmmmmmm.

This is a Delicious and very easy Recipe! I used dried cranberries instead of the fresh cranberries. I poured the dried cranberries into some hot water for 1 minute to reconstitute. I dried the wet cranberries off with paper towels and then added them to the mix. I took this Coffee Cake to a morning Red Hat Society Meeting. There was nothing left except the plate to   bring home. I took a copy of the recipe with me in case someone asked for the recipe. Several people asked for a copy of the recipe. I will positively bake this Recipe again for my family and friends.

This was heavenly. I used my Pampered Chef deep dish baker for this (12 inch stoneware round dish). The topping needed to be increased due to the larger size pan. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cube butter, 2 cups cranberries, 1 cup chopped pecan, 1/4 tsp. salt. for the cake batter I increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon, cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, and salt to 1/2 teaspsoon. I prepared the pan by buttering the bottom and sides.  It slipped right onto the serving dish with no problems after cooling for 10 minutes. Rave reviews in presentation and flavor. Perfect spicy sweet/tart combination. Thank you, Marjorita, for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I made this in a Pampered Chef deep dish baker by increasing some ingredients as listed by another baker below.  For topping-3/4 C brown sugar, 1 stick butter, 2 C cranberries, 1 C pecans.  For cake-1 TB vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt.  What a beautiful cake this is once it's turned over on a glass pedestal dish.  It is just as delicious as it is beautiful.  Heat up in the microwave once it cools to bring back the wonderful warm taste of the topping.  Can't go wrong with this one.

I found this recipe right before Christmas last year, and it was such a hit at our Christmas Eve party that I've had requests to bring it again. I switched it up with blueberries for a baby shower, and made it with cherries and almonds for a summer barbeque.......this is one of my favourite recipes ever!

Guests raved; but DON'T SKIP the step where you wrap foil around the pan! We did and at midnight the night before a party we were up cleaning a layer of burned sugar out of our oven!!! Can't imagine how good this will taste with ALL of that sugar on top, because even with only half it was scrumptious. And beautiful!

The idea is great, but there seems to be something wrong with the batter. I followed it thoroughly and at the end batter was very stiff, my mixer almost stuck in it. I couldn't exactly "pour" it, so I had to drop it by spoonfulls on the cranberries. After baking the cake for 60 minutes the cake top was very nicely browned, a toothpick came out perfectly clean, but after cooling it turned out that center wasn't quite baked through (exactly like one of the previous reviewers has mentioned). I'll try baking a bit longer at lower temperature next time and I'll  use more cranberries and less pecans. Also the toasted pecans would taste much better in this recipe, otherwise they become too soft and loose flavor when baking on the bottom.

Beautiful & delicious!!  This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review.  I made the cake for Christmas morning with leftover cranberries from T'giving and it was a hit.  Taking the advice of other reviewers I jazzed up the batter a bit by adding 1+ tsp almond extract (a MUST in my opinion, but then again I think all cakes require this), an additional tsp+ of cinnamon and a little ginger powder (sorry, I didn't measure).  For the flour I used King Arthur bleached wheat for about half of what it called for.  (I would have used it for all the flour except I ran out.)  The rest of the flour was regular all-purpose.  I lined my spring form pan with parchment paper, sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray, cut in an circle so that it went up about 2.5 " from the sides of the pan and I didn't need foil around the base.  I melted the sugar and butter in a bowl in the microwave and then mixed in the cranberries prior to dumping in pan so that the cranberries were coated uniformly and evenly distributed.   I added all my leftover cranberries, between 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups.  I , too, would recommend the additional berries so that it completely covers the base of the pan.  Then I sprinkled on the nuts and added the batter.  After removing from over I released the pan sides before flipping onto a plate and removing the parchment.  It was all very easy.

Beautiful... I used a regular round cake tin (2 1/2 inches high), buttered and floured, with a circle of baking paper cut to fit the bottom.  Also buttered the top of that for good measure.  Works perfectly.

This cake is so good!!!!  It is moist and the perfect combination of sweet and tart!  I did not have sour cream so I used what I had on hand...which turned out to be 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup apple sauce.  I was looking for a recipe to make for Christmas morning.  This is the first one I tried out and I will look no further!!!  I live at high altitude and found that halfway through the baking process the cake was already getting quite brown on top so I dropped the temperature to 325 for the second half and it turned out perfect.

I tried another coffee recipe from this site (Aunt something's coffee cake) and it was a disaster. I made it twice and it was still horrible. So, once I found this recipe, I was optimistic that this one would be better because it uses sour cream(I think that definitely makes a difference in coffee cakes). I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen strawberries b/c it was the only thing I had, and the coffee cake turned out DELICIOUS! It was AWESOME. It was soft and moist *drools* I really loved the texture of the cake! It was NOT dry or hard, nor too soft. This recipe is definitely a keeper, and I can't wait to make it again. I'd recommend this recipe to everyone! I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating the great taste, but I was searching for a good coffee cake recipe and FINALLY, I found this one: DELICIOUS! :)

This cake is delicious and pretty.  Great for the holidays...something unique for the holiday gatherings.  One tip-put the wrapped springform pan on a cookie sheet to bake because if there is the tiniest hole in the foil you'll have a sticky mess on the bottom of your oven..and a lot of smoke!

I could not find fresh cranberries, so I substituted blueberries. I used 2 cups of blueberries and 1 cup of walnuts, instead of the pecans. The batter will be very thick and I think "spoon" is more appropriate than "pour". I foiled the springform pan, but still got leaks in my oven. Be sure to put a baking sheet under the pan while cooking. Using a bundt pan would solve the problem since they can't leak.  I took this cake to work and got multiple requests for the recipe.  Will try again when cranberries are in season!

Wonderful!! This is SUCH a delicious cake. I made this for Christmas breakfast today and my family loved it. measured out all of the ingredients last night to make things easy this morning and it was just amazing. i changed a few things: i used walnuts for the topping instead of pecans, i had extra cranberries, so i added them into the batter (this was nice, cos they 'popped' and gave lovely pinkish-red patches, like you get in muffins). i also used yogurt instead of sour cream, and used a bit more than 1 cup, cos the batter was very thick. finally, because i love coffee cake with streusel topping, i made some streusel topping and sprinkled it over the top, so that when the cake was flipped, you get the beautiful cranberries on top, and a crunchy streusel base. this took a little longer than 1 hour to bake, and i covered with foil towards the end to stop the streusel burning. this is an amazing recipe - the cake is so soft and delicious! i'll be making this again and again!!

This coffee cake is great!  It came together very easily, the topping was tart and nutty, and the cake was very light and yummy. I couldn't find the base of my springform pan, so I made it in a bundt.  Came out wonderfully!

I made this coffee cake this weekend, and it was amazing!  Tasty and spectacular looking!  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 teaspoon orange oil, the zest from one orange, and orange flavored yogurt instead of sour cream to the batter.  That was just because I really like the combo of orange and cranberry.  I also added walnuts instead of pecans and used a well-greased 9" cake pan (non-springform).  No issues with burning or anything like that, but the sugar did drip, and I forgot to put a cookie sheet under the pan.  Don't forget the cookie sheet!

Cake was delicious.....  however, even though I baked it for the hour that was stated in the recipe, (and a toothpick did come out clean)... when I turned the cake over, the center caved some and was runny.... obviously wasn't done even though the cake was a golden brown....

What an awesome recipe!! So easy to make and tasted excellent! I baked it in an 8 inch square pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and it was great!  I loved the combination of the tart cranberry topping with the sweet cake!  A+++++

I've used this recipe for the last 7 years and have never been disappointed. I have never used a spring form for this recipe--just a regular 9 inch round cake pan. I just flipped it over while it was semi-warm. 
I follow the recipe exactly and it is that good. One of the few recipes on this site, I've ever have to mess with. Thanks for the great recipe.

Looks great and tastes great!  A 9" pan seemed to be too large for this recipie, as the cake only turned out be about 1.5" inches high!  Next time I will use a smaller pan.  I was also concerned with the consistency of the batter, but it worked out fine.

A most delicious recipe!!!  I did not use a springform pan.  I used a 12" round stone dish.  I increased the butter for the topping to 1/2 cup (one stick), the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, cranberries to 1-3/4 cup, and pecans to 3/4 cup.  Using stoneware I had to melt the butter in the microwave (something I wouldn't do using a regular metal pan). This recipe is a keeper.  Suggest buying extra cranberrries and freeze to have on hand just for this recipe.

Not to difficult to make, but definately do NOT use the springfoam pan! Made a huge mess in the bottom of my oven even with the tin foil wrapped all over the bottom. Taste, well my husand loved it, as for me I would have said it was a 3 out of 5. It tastes best a a breakfast treat vs. dessert.

I am more of a cook then a baker, but I was inspired to make this today.  I was very suprised that the cake came out so pretty and delicous. Next time I will add more cranberries but it doesnt need anything else.  Everyone loved it and I will make it again either Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I had over a cup of whole-cranberry cranberry sauce left over from Thanksgiving, not more turkey and didn't want to throw it out.  So I found this recipe and used the cranberry sauce in place of the cranberries and sugar for the topping.  I also didn't have a springform pan, so I used a glass 9" round baking dish.  I cut a circle of parchment to go in the bottom to make sure that the topping would release.  It came out delicious!  The cake is rich, moist, and buttery and the topping, tart and sweet.

The cake tastes great and looks very festive! You don't need to use a springform pan... I used a regular round pan with higher sides and inverted it as soon as I finished cooking it and nothing stuck to the bottom. I  added the zest of one lemon and I loved it! Happy baking!

Excellent excellent excellent cake! I replaced the sour cream with greek yogurt and the cake is so fluffy and less fatty.
I agree about the advice on the cooking time. I lowered by 25 degrees and added 15 minutes of cooking time.

Wow, if only I could give more stars.  I'm primarily a chocolate dessert person, but holy cow was this good.  Easy and absolutely gorgeous.  This was the first time I used fresh cranberries and wow, was this delicious.  Give this one a try!

EXCELLENT!  I looked so forward to making this but didn't have sour cream so I did some substitutions for the sour cream part.  I ended up using 7/8 cup 2% milk, 1 T lemon juice, and 3 T softened butter.  The result couldn't have been better.  I asked Hubby what he thought and he said, "This recipe tastes like a pineapple upside down cake with cranberries instead of pineapples".   Sounds like a perfect recipe to me!  Thank you Marjorita Whyle for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe!

Beautiful, absolutely gorgeous cake! I have discovered that this cake tastes best with 1 2/3 c. cranberries instead of 1 1/4 c. Walnuts can also be substituted for pecans (though the pecans do taste better). Also, the bread part was very light (in a good way), but a little bland. So, I use a spice mixture consisting of: 1 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. ginger, 1/4 t. nutmeg, 1/8 t. allspice, and 1/8 t. cloves. Next time, I might try the orange juice and zest addition that somebody recommended. As a plus, this is a super easy recipe!

Cranberry season doesn't last long so go get your cranberries now and freeze some for later.  A very pretty cake and it's not too sweet.  I think next time for a little extra I'll add some orange zest.

Excellent recipe!  It is very moist, tasty and has a beautiful presentation.  It works well as a dessert as well as a morning treat.  The only change I made was to add orange zest (a little on the bottom and in the cake batter).  Orange and cranberry go so well together, I just couldn't resist!  A definite keeper!

this is EXCELLENT.  I add more cranberries to the top and add some (about 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup) to the batter to keep it moist.  DELICIOUS!

Oh sooooooooo good!!! & very light when warm.  We added more cranberries, but will add even more the next time.  We didn't have a springform pan so used a 10" deep dish pie pan & sprayed it so the cake wouldn't stick.

Mmm this was so good! It had a great coffee cake taste plus a nice tang from the cranberries and crunch of the nuts which went nicely with the sweetness of the brown sugar. It was also very moist. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I had to substitute vanilla yogurt (I just cut down a little on the vanilla and sugar in the cake to balance that out) but I'm sure the sour cream is key to the moistness of this cake. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe sounded excellent, but the result was very disappointing.  As soon as I took the cake out of the oven, it collapsed.  After cooling for 10 minutes, I inverted it on a cake plate and ended up with 5 chunks (blobs) of cake.  I had made this for a friend's birthday but it was not fit for guests.  The cake and recipe went in the trash.

My topping stayed granular, so I had to go over it with a torch, this only helped a little.  I would definitely add orange zest to the cranberries and batter mix.  I also added some of the orange juice to the batter.  Because the topping stayed granular, it was not a pretty cake but tasted good

I have not even eaten this cake yet, but I feel confident that it is going to be great.  I could just eat the batter!  I made a few changes:  I used a well butter and floured baking dish instead of a springpan.  I have made this substitution before and it works well.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I increased the baking soda to 2 tsp and added an extra 1/3 cup of milk to help the batter rise.  I am looking forward to my first taste and will report back.  But as I said, this cake had me at the batter!

UPDATE:  OMG!  Sooooo good.  Light, tasty, great caramel-ly top.  De-lish.

Easy to make and so flavorful; I changed it at times to make different flavors, made some adding orange zest and extract to the batter. And adding more zest to the topping and drizzling it with swirls of dark chocolate.  I made a bunch of these last year for Christmas bake sales and to give as gifts setting on old cake plates that I collected at yard sales durning the summer.

I love this cake! It came out perfectly for me in 62 minutes ( I add 2 minutes every time I open the oven). I didn't make any changes, but next time I'll add 1 tsp almond extract with the vanilla, just because I love it, not because it needs it. I liked this recipe's method of boiling the butter/brown sugar together to get caramel better than just melting the butter -- I didn't have nearly as much leakage as other similar recipes which have you just pour the melted butter over the brown sugar. It binds together in the caramel if you let it boil for 1 minute, which is quite nice. (Don't go longer -- caramel hardens the longer it cooks, you don't want chewy or worse - crispy candy coating - here.) Try and have your cold ingredients at room temperature if you're worried about it underbaking or overbrowning in the allotted time -- nothing will slow a cook time faster than 40 degree eggs & sour cream in a recipe timed for old-fashioned-barely-chilled-in-the-root-cellar-ingredients  -- as so many cakes are. This is a good recipe & the "brown color" of the inside of the cake is due to using dark-colored cinnamon, and is perfectly normal & delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty. I doubled the topping recipe along with a whole bag of fresh cranberries and used a 9x13 pan. I didn't want to deal with all the leaks. I changed the cake recipe that I made up so that it would be enough to fill the 9x13. After it cooked, it flipped out beautifully onto a serving tray. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Moist, buttery, tart, nutty, perfect fall coffee cake.  Watch the time.  I baked mine in a 9 inch spring-form pan and it was done in 32 minutes.

I used enough cranberries to cover the pan (a bit more than the recipe called for) and finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans (the only changes). This cake was DELICIOUS!! The stated cooking time was perfect, too.   Great texture and flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

It was a highlight of the dinner. My husband tasted the batter first and then couldn't wait for the cake to come out of the oven. And it was SO good. Very moist. I seriously don't understand how people can say it's dry. I followed the recipe word to word. The only variation, I doubled the pecans and it turned out to be perfect. Very easy to make too. I greesed the pan a little bit and at the end the cake came right out, I didn't even need to remove the sides. It's a keeper in my family!

I made this exactly as written and it was DELICIOUS!! Not everybody likes cranberries because they are tart so consider that before making it. If the cranberries are an issue I'm sure blueberries would ROCK!! I will definitely try this cake with other berries in the near future. This cake is perfect!

I have made this several times.  It is very good!  I have trouble getting this to set in the middle, so I usually flip it onto a glass platter so I can throw it back in the oven to get the top to cook through.  I get rave reviews on this cake!

I want to serve this for a Christmas brunch, so I tried it yesterday (Thanksgiving)on my family.  It got rave reviews. It was sweet enough and  moist enough. I made it in a 9" square pan, well sprayed with cooking spray and except for a little topping, it came out of the pan OK. Yummy!

The only change I made was to use blueberries instead of cranberries, and to cook it at 325 for 45 minutes (I used a dark pan). Fantastic - the only other thing I would change is to add just a little less sugar and perhaps more nuts as they disappeared in the mass of berries. Tasted so good though - excellent!

This recipe was easy and wonderful!  I followed the recipe precisely except for adding a handful of chopped cranberries to the mix.  The cake was very moist.  Cooled for 10 minutes and then inverted, but some of the top stuck to the pan.  It was easy to patch a bit and when it cooled further it was a spectacular sight.  Might let it cool longer next time.  A definite "keeper"!
At least 6 people asked for the recipe on my first time making it.

Loved it!!!  
Using the cookie sheet under the spring-form pan was an excellent idea.  By adjusting the recipe, as a reviewer had suggested, ie; 3/4 c brown sugar, 1 stick butter, 1TB vanilla extract and 2c cranberries, it filled the 9-inch pan nicely.  Please note that the batter did not "pour" out, I had to scrape it out and smooth out the batter once in the pan.  I also used halved, toasted pecans, instead of chopping the nuts, it was a beautiful look.  Very impressive!! I'd make this again, its a perfect autumn and winter desert.

This was so yummy!  When my husband saw it, he asked if we could have the cake for dinner instead of what I had planned.  It is a pretty cake and tastes great.  I will definitely make this again!

Took this to a brunch and the guests LOVED IT!  I did tweak a few things when I made it the 2nd time [to use up the cranberries].  
1.  I made this in a bundt pan to avoid the issues with the springform pan.  Worked and looked beautifully!
2.  Since I made this in the bundt pan, I scaled the bake time to 55 minutes.  Perfect.  
3.  I increased the cranberries to 2 cups.  Also perfect amount.
4.  I used glazed pecans instead of plain ones.  It's what I had in my pantry from making pecan pies and they worked great.  
5.  I didn't boil off the brown sugar.  I used the same trick I use when I make pineapple upside-down cakes.  I sliced up the butter and pieced it around the pan and sprinkled the brown sugar over top and put it in the prepared oven for 10 minutes while I was making the cake portion.  I pulled it out, added the cranberries and pecans, then spooned in the cake mixture.  It came together perfectly.  
6.  Set your timer again for 10 minutes after you pull the finished cake out so that you get it inverted on a plate.  Otherwise, the brown sugar mixture starts to cool and harden and allows the cake to stick to the pan.

I LOVED this cake.  It tasted so good and was the perfect accompaniment to the Christmas brunch.  This will be a go-to recipe for winter holiday events.

Followed the recipe almost exactly - the only thing different is I added a little bit of whipping cream to thin the batter a bit.  The recipe poster would do well to say "spoon the batter" rather than "pour the batter" to reduce the negative comments in that regard.  A thinner batter would make it easier to spread over the cranberry / butter / sugar layer.  I should also note that it took far longer to cook than the 60 minutes stated. 
We had it for dessert this evening and my husband is still raving about it.  It's a perfect blend of sweet and tart.  Oh, I just remembered, I used Splenda to replace regular granulated sugar. No matter what, this recipe is deserving of 5 stars.

11.3.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26016/cranberry-upside-down-coffee-cake/ ... I followed the recipe, but not the directions.  I added the sour cream to the butter-sugar mixture then the dry ingredients.  Also, for the topping, added the berries to the pot.  I cooked those on medium three minutes - enough time to pop (cook) & juice to be released.  I cooled that then poured it in an 8x8 glass dish.  The batter is quite thick so I spooned that on.  I'm wondering if buttermilk would be a better choice than sour cream.  I went ahead & baked it at 350, not following reviewers' suggestions; & for an hour, not more or less.  It is a dark cake; a dark, buttery cake with a tangy cranberry topping.  It looks overbaked, but it's just dark.  The idea of cranberry upside-down cake looks pretty in my mind, but this one isn't so pretty.

Very good! (also, very sweet!) ;-) Next time I'm thinking a bit less sugar (especially in the caramel-y top/bottom), and some orange zest to go with the cranberries. Maybe throw in some cranberries in the batter as well right before cooking and some fresh cranberries on top post-flipping. Overall, the crumb was really nice (light and fluffy)and the caramel top/bottom got the base dense and caramel-y. A big win all-around!

Wonderful!! I had made this recipe for a ladies breakfast and it worked out splendid! I added some chopped cranberries in the batter(Worked great) and I didn't have a springform pan handy so I used a bundt pan which worked great, however, you will have to keep in mind that it doesn't take as long to cook and you have to be careful of the sides sticking when done.. I used the other side of a fork (didn't have a knife handy)and slid it in between the pan and the cake so it would come out smoothly.. however, It was either that I didn't do the middle as good or I wasn't really sure what to do when it said to cool it... Any way it stuck to the pan in the middle so I just scraped it off and put it back on top. Other than my mistake it was a fantastic Coffee Cake!!

I made this cake over the weekend and since I got rid of all my springform pans I just put non-stick aluminum foil in the bottom of my pan and it worked GREAT.  The cake was a DEFINITE keeper recipe although because I like cranberries so much I will add extra next time or try adding blueberries also.  Cherries or apples would also be good!!

I hate to be the downer here, but I did not care for this AT ALL. :( Not only was my cake visually unappealing, it was quite bland. My mom and I were on our way out the door to do some holiday shopping (she was in a H-U-R-R-Y!!!), so I hastily inverted my cake despite my gut telling me not to.... I wish I would have waited until my springform pan had COMPLETELY cooled instead of waiting 10 minutes as directed. My cake kinda sunk, but with my mom's assistance, I was able to save it. Now, about the actual cake. Both my mom and I felt the cranberry topping was too tart and that the cake itself was not nearly sweet enough to compensate. I personally did not care for the pecans (which I toasted first), but my mom didn't seem to mind them. Since my husband does not care for cranberries (he is a confirmed fruit hater!), I ended up tossing this in the trash. :( I hope this works for you because it didn't for me. Thanks anyways, Marjorita. :-)

This is an amazing coffee cake recipe.  I just loved the tangyness of the cranberries next to the sweetness of the cake.  I baked this in a springform pan, but next time I am going to try an angel food pan or a bundt pan.  I think this will help the centre bake a bit quicker.  Will let you know.

This is an excellent cake. I made it for Valentine's Day in a heart-shaped Wilton cake pan and it turned out wonderfully! I made it first for an office party today with the sour cream, and again tonight for my family, but I ran out of sour cream, so I used a 6 oz container of apple cinnamon yogurt and 2 oz of whole milk to substitute. Now that I've seen what you can do with cranberries, I'm thinking that just about any fruit would work--why not blueberries? or peaches? Give this one a try--you'll be glad you did! PS: I used the spray flour to coat the pan before pouring in the butter/brown sugar mixture, and that probably helped the cake release perfectly.

SO yummy! I don't own a springform pan, so I lined a 9" cake pan with foil-backed parchment paper - worked perfectly. Subbed Smart Balance for the butter (as I always do), and Splenda Baking Blend for the sugars. I also used light sour cream, next time I will try nonfat yogurt. Reduced temp by 25 degrees because of my dark pan, and laid a piece of foil on top halfway through the baking time to keep from overbrowning. Mike was done at 55 min. I will only chop the pecans coarsely next time, and will sprinkle in the pan before the cranberries. I will also freeze more cranberries next holiday season, so I can enjoy this more often!

This cake is amazing. I omitted the pecans and drizzed the cooled cake with a glaze that I made. I used a 9 inch springform pan sealed with foil. No mess in the oven :). This one may be a coffee cake but it's best with a big ole glass of ice cold milk! Thanks for sharing.

I baked this cake this evening for our Bible study group and definitely got the "oohs and ahhs" when I flipped it over on my platter. Everyone loved it, and most of it was completely gobbled up by the end of the night. I was asked for the recipe, and am gladly giving it out! AMAZING recipe!!

This coffee cake is FANTASTIC!  I made it yesterday and had nothing but rave reviews on it.  I did add the orange zest, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

What a great cake!  A little tart from the cranberries, but the cake has just the right balance of sweetness.  Is a keeper.

This is one of the prettiest cakes!  I made it for Thanksgiving this year.  I followed the recipe exact, except, I changed the servings to 18, used an entire bag of cranberries, and I used my bundt cake pan.  I was concerned after adding the sugar/butter mixture and the cranberries that I wouldn't have enough room.  It worked perfectly!  I generously greased the pan with shortening and removal was so easy.  I will definitely be making this again!  :O)

I've made this cake several times and it always comes out perfectly!  It's great as a holiday dessert or anytime with a cup of coffee.  In the fall I stock up on cranberries and freeze them, so I can make this any time of year.

This cake was delicious! The only change made was to use gluten free flour mix. I especially love the cake batter, itself! So good! It rose evenly and was fluffy and moist.  I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank gosh everyone is scared to eat my gluten free creations ... more for me :)

I made this recipe last minute and ended up using craisins instead of fresh or frozen cranberries. I was still very very impressed with the recipe, the craisins retained that nice tart flavor throughout the baking.

I followed the recipe almost exactly though I started with frozen cranberries so I stuck them in a small sauce pan with the other topping ingredients and cooked all until the butter and sugar were dissolved.  Also, I used Amaretto in place of Vanilla because I was out of Vanilla.  Aside from that, the only change I made was lowering the baking temp from 350 to 325, I baked for one hour.  The cake turned out beautifully with wonderful flavor.  I'll definitely make again.

I really wanted to love this coffee cake but it just diddnt happen for me.  It wasnt as pleasant looking as I thought it would be.  The only change I made was to bake it in a round cake pan....It tasted fine but didnt knock my socks off.

WOW!  Tastes great and looks even better!  I agree with a previous rater and cannot figure out why you have to bake it in a springform pan.  I put in a round cake pan and it flipped right out.  Also add more cranberries - 1 1/4 cup was not nearly enough.  Will be making again & again.

Awesome!!!  I would not change a thing!  It only gets more moist as the day goes on!  Next time, I will try apples or blueberries instead of cranberries...just to shake things up!  I still love the cranberries though! The picture doesn't do it justice!  The picture makes it look dry...and it's not!  Very light and fluffy!

This is amazing!! I made it for the 1st time 4 years ago and it has become a thanksgiving staple.  I never have leftovers and people are always asking me to make it!  Just be sure to wrap your pan well in the beginning.  The first time I made it I burned myself..whoops owell it was totally worth it this is delicious, thanks for sharing!!

Yummy and easy!  The only change I was made was to add a little orange extract to the batter.  It was devoured by my family in one day!   I thought the cranberries were gonna be bitter....but it was delicious.   Even my picky pastry chef daughter thought it was good...it must be a keeper!!

This is a very, very delicious cake and so moist! The only thing I did different was use blueberries inplace of the cranberries, but otherwise I went exactly by the recipie, even lining the outside of the pan with foil. I had no problems and the cake turned out Perfect.  My husband told me to definitely make this again. I'm going to try making it with almonds the next time.

really quick and easy, and quite pretty! I only had dry cranberries and soaked them in hot water for a little while. I also substituted pecans with hazelnuts, and it was a smash! Only, I'd like to try with less butter, at least in the batter.

A delicious cake with beautiful presentation.  Perfect for the holidays.  I used a 7" springform pan and made a smaller cake with more height.  It baked perfectly with the time/temp listed in the recipe.    This would be a great cake with any fruit/nut combo.  Next time I am making apple/pecan topping.   Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a stand out recipe. Like many other raters have mentioned, the presentation alone is worth the 4 stars. I make this cake often and make it just as the recipe says. It's hard not to eat all the carmel before you get it in the spring form pan. :D Enjoy!

this is a nice cake, but we weren't wowed by it.  not sure why; we love cranberries--maybe it was the cake part of it.  i thought we both loved coffee cake, but maybe we don't.  i served it cold first, so then i remembered it said to serve warm, so I warmed it and tried it again with some whipped cream.  it's not bad, but not my favorite, so it's probably just the cake part to us.  we're very picky about our desserts! I didn't have any problems with making it at any point--batter was fine, cranberries were easy, etc .   thanks for the recipe!

All I had was dried cranberries so I took a chance.  I do not have an springform pan (never needed one) so that was another uncertain.  Everything worked out just fine.  It was really good.  The whole family enjoyed this.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I wanted to make it fresh for work, so to save some time I made the topping ahead and put it in the pan and refrigerated it overnight. It came out perfect.  I keep getting requests to make this again.

Beautiful presentation.  I did watch the placement of cranberries and pecans as recommended.  I also added the zest of one orange (1/2 to bottom/ 1/2 to batter).  Another reviewer came up with a no-leak solution which I followed: spray springform pan with pan, and line with parchment paper, going up the sides slightly.  I wrapped the pan in foil and placed on a cookie sheet, but I found that it wasn't really necessary.  The parchment really does the trick.  One taster asked if it had some type of fruit in the batter!  It was moist, flavorful and beautiful.  Will definately make again. Note:  For my oven, 1 Hour and 7 minutes at 325 was perfect.

Such a yummy recipe! It beat out the pies on Thanksgiving. Easy to make and not too sweet, but just right. :)

SOOO good!!!  Rave reviews every single time I make it.  I cut back on the sugar for the batter and cut back on the butter for the topping, but other than that, I don't change a thing.  This is a definate winner!  Such an impressive presentation.

Revised -- Used 1/4 Tsp. salt as called for. When I popped this out of the pan, I felt like Betty Crocker herself!  Gorgeous, and tasted every bit as good as it looked. Fabulous!!  I added more pecans and cranberries to the bottom and the batter, and baked it in a regular single layer cake pan sprayed with Pam for 65 min. I also used Splenda for the white sugar. Came out like a dream!  Can't wait to make this again and share it (not sharing this one!)  Thank you!!

I just made this cake this afternoon because my husband loves this cake very much, I have to make it almost very weekend.
This time I used walnuts instead of pecan, it was as good as pecan. I used "cake & pastry" flour and baked it at 350F for 45 minutes, it turned out soooooo good, sooooo soft. If I wouldn't have thought that I have to control my weight, I could have eaten at least half of it.

I just tried this tonight on a whim. I baked it in a 9 inch iron skillet for about 45 minutes at 350. Yum! Even my picky husband said it was fabulous! Thanks for the "keeper" recipe!

I made three of these for three seperate Thanksgiving occasions and the third one came out perfect!  Third times a charm, right? My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it though!  The other two came out a little dark on the bottom and not near as moist as the third one.  I didn't bake it for the full 60 minutes, more like 45 minutes but I'm sure every oven is different so just keep an eye on it and take it out as soon as its done.  I think the brown sugar-butter mixture on the bottom can burn easily if overbaked and it didn't have a pleasant taste.  Also, I added extra cranberries, pecans, and cinnamon so if you're into these ingredients, add on!  Also I noted some pictures of the cake aren't as pretty as others and I'm all about the oohs and aahs.  When laying the pecans and cranberries on the bottom, be sure to get an even mixture so when the cake is turned upside down you can see all the beautiful colors and textures.  Great recipe, I would definitely make it again!

This recipe got me a lot of compliments. We served it after dinner on Christmas Eve with some vanilla ice cream. I made it with candied pecans (by mistake), and the topping was very, very sweet. I think it would also be good with walnuts. A little bit of my cranberry/pecan topping stuck to the bottom of the springform pan when I flipped the cake, but I scraped it off with a spatula and crumbled it over the rest of the cake, and it looked fine.

If I make it again, I will use a whole bag of frozen cranberries, and also mix some of the cranberries in with the cake batter -- we agreed that it would be nice to have that cranberry flavor in the cake. Overall, a good, guest-pleasing recipe that I will try again!

This recipe was great! I doubled it, and brought it to two christmas parties. Everyone loved it. I made it several days in advance and it kept well. The only change I made was a partial substitution of brown sugar in the cake mix because I ran out of white. I used about equal potions of each. Didn't seem to matter. I did not use a springform pan, just a regular 9 inch. This may have effected my cook time becuase it was done in half the time for some reason. Either  that or my oven got wacky. Anyway, this is a keeper all year round! Such a great flavor.

I never used fresh cranberries before this.  They were so easy to use, and delicious!  I used brown sugar in the batter instead of white sugar, and I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 unbleached all-purpose.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream (and increased it by 1/4 cup).  It looked and tasted great.  I made it in a 10" springform so it was larger but thinner, and it was still moist.
Next time I will use less sugar in the topping (cranberry) part.

Great recipe! I cut the sour cream down to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of undiluted frozen orange juice cencentrate for a nice citrus flavour. I couldn'd find my springform pan, so I used a Bundt instead, which worked just fine. Great recipe. Thanx :)

This is the most appreciated cake I have ever baked though I am not a bad cook to begin with. I used a normal 9" cake pan a I did not have a springform and greased it well. I lowered the baking temperature to 375 degrees for the last half hour only because I was a little scared that it might burn but I am not sure if it would. THis is a great recipe. Thanks a million times. Turned it into a birthday cake cause it looks so good. My husband just keeps looking for excuses to eat it. Oh yes, I had mixed everything with my hand like my mother would, centuries back:))

Got major raves on this cake and I really enjoyed it myself.  Was easy to prepare.  Wrapped the springform in foil and put on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Next time may use the stoneware dish as suggested by another reviewer (dontcha love PC?).  Was very easy to bake and came out nice.  The top edge stuck to my pan in a couple places, so I'd probably grease the pan next time to see if I could avoid this.  Great cake!

This is so delicious my husband couldn't stop eating it.  I am guessing you could use this with any kind of fruit topping all year long, the cake itself is so tasty.  Next time I will cut down on the topping a bit.

The cake is AWESOME!!  I didn't care for the cranberries (personal preference), so I tried it with just the butter, brown sugar, and pecans.  It was good, but the brown sugar still had a sugary consistency.  Next time I will either try to make a caramel sauce (add some cream to the brown sugar & butter), or I will try apples or peaches instead of cranberries.

This cake tastes amazing. I did two of them using raspberries instead of cranberries and one without cinnamon. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5-star is because of the way this recipe is organised. As a beginner making the first cake was awful. Not having the quantities IN the recipe made it so I had to go back constantly and recheck I stead of it being right in my face. Also the way the prep is organised makes for a really complicated set-up and crazy amount of dishes. The ingredient list should also be in order so that if they aren’t in the recipe you can easily know where to find them (ie the two butter steps). The second cake was much faster and easier. I prepped my batter before even thinking of the “caramel” Aspect.  This allowed me to clear my counter, clean a little then focus on the butter and sugar so nothing burnt. Also... do the brown sugar and butter in the microwave... SOOOOO much easier than on the stove and you can put your glass baking pan right In the microwave with the ingredients. At least two dishes saved there!

I have made this several times and it is fantastic!  The key is to NOT use a springform pan! I made that mistake once and even with wrapping the pan in foil, it leaked it my oven.  I have used a 9" round cake pan and an 8" square pan with success.  The round pan is a bit prettier but both taste YUM!

This cake is moist and the perfect balance of sweet and tart! The only changes I made were adding 1 1/4 cups of sour cream instead of 1 cup, and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar swirled into the batter before pouring and baking. Also I used a basic 8" round cake pan lined with a parchment round and it came out perfectly.

12-08-2015 ~This is as beautiful as it is delicious.  It almost looks bejeweled, and makes for  a stunning presentation, be it the whole cake or individual servings.  It is the ideal coffee cake for fall and winter in general, but for the Christmas season in particular.  You will be very proud of yourself when others behold the sight of it!  As for taste, the cranberries and the brown sugar in the topping harmonize well - I love that almost butterscotch flavor.  And I cannot see this without the pecans.  In other words, the topping is absolutely "the icing on the cake."  The cake itself is moist, buttery and flavorful, the hint of cinnamon just enough to give it a little boost of flavor and warmth in color, but not enough to be so distinct it takes over anything or everything else. BUT...  yeah, there's a but.  I must caution that this was more difficult than most to test done.  The toothpick test was anything but reliable.  It tested clean but proved to be totally uncooked, raw, in the center - and I'm no newbie to this baking thing!  Better was the spring back test, or better yet, placing your whole hand on the top of the cake to test for firmness.  (Yes, I had no choice but to pop the cake back into the pan to give it additional time in the oven)  However,  the final result was a cake that, while done, had sunk in the center.  For this reason alone, despite the fact I really liked the cake, I would be too gun shy to make it again.

I made this for my sewing group, where we like to test new recipes. EVERYONE ,thought it was excellant. The only problem is trying to buy fresh cranberries other than this time of year.

As a baking newbie, I found this recipe awesome, the cake is moist and very delicious. Some of the reviews got me worried but I simply followed the recipe ingredients and directions, used a normal 9 inch cake pan lined with foil, the cake turned out very nice. The only thing that I concern about is the baking temperature and time, I baked the cake 325F instead of 350F for only little more than 30 mins and the surface turned slightly golden, so I sticked a toothpick in the middle of the cake and it came out clean, it's done! Do keep an eye on the cake, keep checking on it! And I used fresh cherry instead of cranberry because I had a bunch of ripe cherries in the fridge, don't know if that's the reason the bottom(top when you flip the cake over) got a bit soggy and the color look greyish, but it tastes way better than it looks.

I used plain chobani greek yogurt (one whole 6oz container plus some more to make a cup. Only had walnuts & dried cranberries in the house and they were great in this recipe. I plumped the cranberries with boiling water before adding them. I will definitely make this again!

Really good.  I was afraid the cranberries would be over-powering, but they were not.  I have a 10" pan, so I used 2 cups of cranberries and 3/4 c. pecans.  My cake was done after 50 minutes in a 325-degree oven.  I think I will also try this recipe with tart cherries and almonds.

An absolute winner.  I baked it in a Pampered Chef oval stone baking dish, with a single recipe, with the following adaptations. I put the cranberries in the food processor for a few spins to coarsely chop them, then used about 2 cups of chopped.  I didn't have commercial sour cream, so I put about 2 T lemon juice in a cup measure, then filled it with heavy cream from a farmer friend, and let that thicken while I got the rest of the ingredients ready.  I used raw sugar in place of the white sugar.  I only needed to bake it 50 minutes at 335. The only change I would make next time is to sprinkle the pecans onto the brown sugar/butter mixture first, then put the cranberries in, rather than the other way around.  The crumb of this cake is so light and moist.  My family loved it on this snowed-in morning.

This is my favorite go to cake in the fall!  I buy bags of cranberries when I can get them and freeze them for the off-season.  I do make a few changes however-  I always use light sourcream(and have used fat free) and it turns out just fine.  I also always use my Pampered Chef deep dish baker.  I also use 1 stick of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar with the pecans- and  a full bag of cranberries and probably closer to 3/4c of pecans(I am a handful measurer!  2 handfuls!)  Another one that you just can't screw up!

My sisters and I made this for my mom on Mother's Day and it turned out wonderful!! The presentation was beautiful, and the cake itself was extremely moist and yummy. We made the recipe as written, except to use a 9x13 pan, and served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Next time I will double the brown sugar and butter mixture. This cake will definitely be made again in our home!! Thanks for sharing:)

I could not find cranberries (fresh, frozen, or canned) at the 2 stores I tried, so I decided to try the recipe with cherries instead.  The cake was very, very good, but I will not make it with cherries again.  The topping was a little mushy (I think because of the cherries), so next time I'll try harder to find the cranberries.

I made this exactly as written and loved it!  I did need a tray under the pan to catch a bit of overflow because I used a cake pan instead of a springform, but it still came out with a perfect flavor and texture.  Thanks for a great recipe I will be making often!

So good! I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream since we didn't have any. I also took others' suggestions and baked it at 325 degrees for about 70-75 minutes and it came out perfect. Will definitely be making this again and experimenting with different fruits and nuts. Thanks!!

AMAZING. I would use less butter with the brown sugar next time, they didn't mix well and that was what leaked during baking. I only had one egg on hand and substituted plain nonfat yogurt for sour cream with great results. Scrumptious!

The best part of this cake is that it is light and fluffy.  Removing the cake from a spring form pan is so easy.  I'm giving this recipe four stars because there simply is not enough cranberries for the topping, and there's too much butter in the batter.  I would omit the nuts.  I'm going back to my old cranberry upside down cake recipe which uses egg whites for volume and a whole bag of cranberries without nuts.

This is a beautiful cake. I love, love, LOVE the cranberry/pecan caramel topping & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. I had to use dried whole cranberries that I rehydrated to plump them up a bit & bourbon praline pecans. The result was still addicting & I can't wait to try it again with fresh cranberries when they're in season. I didn't use the actual cake part of the recipe but certainly will next time. Thanks for a new take on an old favorite. :o)

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  My step-dad, who hates cranberries, ate 1/4 of the cake himself!  I followed the recipe exactly with no changes, and it turned out perfectly.  I've definitely added this to my recipe box.

Nice change from pumpkin pie for holiday dessert. I followed the recipe but think that I will add more cinnamon next time. Wonderful taste and  textures. I was concerned that it would stick to the pan but it came out fine.

I used almonds instead of walnuts to see if a "cranberry almond" flavor would be a nice twist.  I recommend it, especially if you can find lightly flavored almonds (such as vanilla) like I did.  However, I found the coffee cake base to be a bit bland/dense, but maybe I did something wrong.

This was a hit!  Gorgeous presentation.  I definitely recommend wrapping it in foil as described or putting the springform pan on a baking sheet because the cranberry juices leak.  Yummy!

I made this just as the recipe read and it was GREAT! I love the pecan/cranberry combo. It looked beautiful, it tasted great, and it was really easy. The only little issue was when I flipped it over, a little (less than 1/8th of the edge) of the topping stuck to the bottom of the pan. Most of it stuck back on top of the cake when I released the latch on the pan, but any suggestions to make sure it doesn't happen again? release the latch before flipping maybe?

This is just the best and very easy to prepare.  Very moist cake, and with the amount of sugar the cake is not overly sweet!  I live in high altitude (5300 feet) and typically we have to make adjustments.  I just followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  You do get lots of ooh's and ah's at presentation.

This coffee cake is delicious!  I have been experimenting with cranberries this season and this is my favorite recipe so far - the cake part tastes like coffee cake should, and the topping is nice and not-too-tart and tastes great with the pecans. Like another reviewer said, don't skip the step about putting foil around the bottom of the cake pan before putting it in the oven - the cranberry mixture will leak.

Made this recipe first time for a staff potluck. Received rave reviews. Number of people asked for the recipe.

Two things I would change about the recipe:
1) I minced the cranberries in the food processor and it blended the flavor more.
2) I would spray the pan prior to baking.

Delicious flavor though!

This is an AWESOME recipe!!! I did make one change, which i think is key- i added the zest of one orange and squeezed 2 or 3 tablespoons of the juice to the batter. It made the cake have a slight orange flavor- it was a great compliment to the cranberries. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

A good cake with a nice tart-cranberry topping.  I followed the advice of others and baked at 325 degrees for 75 minutes and  it turned out dark golden on top (bottom) and was fully done inside.

I made this recipe twice this week and it was a big hit with our friends both time. It's so easy and turns out like a gourmet bake shop cake. It took exactly an hour . Its important to wrap the pan in tin foil ..it will save a messy clean up. I used strawberries ( frozen ) with walnuts the first time and fresh peaches and walnuts( skins removed ) second time .Both were super. At our dinner party I served the cake with a drizzle of Idobo Natural African cream Liqueur . I think any kind of cream liqueur would be great!!

OMG...I made this for work today and got rave reviews.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I also upped the topping amount (stick of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar) I also used 2 cups of cranberries and chopped them and about 3/4 cup of walnuts.  I layed the cranberries and walnuts down first by mistake but it didn't effect it.  I didn't have a 9 inch spring form pan so I used a round cake pan.  I sprayed with cooking spray and lined the bottom with parchment paper since i am known for having things stick and didn't want this to stick...worked like a charm, slid right out with no problem at all. I also cooked it at 325 for 65-70 minutes and it was great.  This was served the next day and was amazing, can't wait to try it warm though and maybe even blueberries.

i made this cake to take to work. It was completely gone before lunch. I added an apple to the cranberries and a few more pecans than it called for. It turned out wonderful and very moist. I will definately be making this again very soon!

I was happy how this turned out, not only did this taste good but looked very pretty.  I will make this one the next time I have  guests.   I used walnuts because that is what I happened to have and I agree that the cranberries and the nuts taste good together.   Pretty easy to make too!

This was delicious.  My whole family loved it.  I left out the pecans 'cause my husband and daughter have nut allergies so I increased the amount of cranberries.  Will make again.

This is a great recipe. I made it to take to a friend who was recently released from hospital and it was an awesome gift. I made it as directed, only adding 1/4 cup more pecans. I did use a 9-inch pan, but found it needed more than 60 minutes to bake (might be my oven) - next time I'll keep it in 10 to 15 minutes longer. Thanks for the recipe, Marjorita.

The cake was really nice and moist! I used dried cranberries and the taste was still great. The only thing I would change would be to add more nuts the next time around.

I made this for Christmas brunch plus 2 others for gifts.  All 3 turned out wonderful.  Such an easy recipe to put together. I added more cranberries and used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 white flour with no difference in taste.  Make sure you put in a greased springform pan.

This is absolutely beautiful and delicious.  I used 2 C. cranberries and 1 C. pecans, and added them to the brown sugar/butter mixture before pouring into the pan.  Baked at 325 for ~65 minutes, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Perfect for the holidays, and as a dessert, too!

I made this recipe twice at Christmas, one for my boyfriend's parents and one for my family, and it was a hit both times!  I followed the suggested increases in nuts, cranberries, etc. in other comments but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cakes were so beautiful when I flipped them out of the pan that my dad was inspired to photograph them.  One tip - definitely cook the full time if not a little longer - I did about 65 minutes on the first one, covering with foil for the last bit, and it was perfect.  We took the second one out a little sooner and it wasn't cooked all the way through in the middle, as many others have reported.  Just be patient, let it go a little longer than you think you need to, and it will be fantastic.

This recipe is quite easy to follow and the results are excellent.  I use 1/2 C. of brown sugar and 2C. of cranberries.  It makes the topping of the cake a little more tart and absolutely delicious.  It was a huge hit in my home!!!

I have made this cake over the past 2 years and get rave review everytime I serve it. It is a great Christmas Holiday cake. I arrange some whole pecans and cranberries  on the  bottom of the cake in a nice pattern to make the presentation beautiful when the cake is turned over.

I used hazelnuts and white whole wheat flour--I'm not sure what white whole wheat flour is, but it seems to be relatively new on the market and I've been trying it out. This coffee cake was delicious, moist, and the cranberries were nice and tart.  Everybody loved it.

Spectacular looking and wonderful to eat. Looks like it's waiting to have its picture taken for Bon Appetite. Made in a 9" round 2" high cake pan, buttered the sides well and it filled the pan and slipped out like a dream. Was slightly more generous with the cranberries and pecans and added the zest of one large orange to the batter. Wonderful combinartion of flavors. Thanks for the tip to bake at 325, it was brown and probably done in 60 minutes, however, gave it 5 minuites more for good measure. I am a hard to please foodie, but this pleased me no end.

A really yummy cake and it looks beautiful, too.  I didn't have enough sour cream on hand so I wound up using a combination of sour cream and raspberry yogurt.  I too baked at 325 F and it was done after 60 minutes.

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover cranberries from T-giving and this was the perfect dessert.  I took some others' recommendations and turned the oven down to 325º and baked for 75 mins.  I think 65 - 70 mins. might have been a little better.  I also used my 9" Pampered Chef deep dish pie plate and it was the perfect size but stuck at the sides when I tried to remove it.  Perhaps baking a few less mins. would have prevented that.  Otherwise, it was really delicious.  The kids liked it, too!

Incredible.  I'd use enough cranberries to cover the bottom and provide more flavor.

Wonderful recipe- made for Thanksgiving Day breakfast instead of our usual cinnamon rolls and it's amazing!  Sliced cranberries for more uniform appearance and taste, and baked at 325 for about 75 minutes (like another review suggested).  Great recipe!

This was good.  I have made one similar though that did not have cinnamon in it.  I like the one without cinnamon better.  However, the texture of this cake is light - not heavy & dense at all.  Overall, a good recipe.  Just probably not my personal favorite.

This was just OK. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used a 7" pan instead of a 9". Well, I had to cook it much longer of course (about 75 min) and the topping was very dark - the cranberries and pecans looked almost black, and so it didn't look nearly as pretty as the picture. The cake was extremely moist and delicious as a coffee cake should be, but I was disappointed with the presentation. Next time I'll follow the instruction and use a 9" pan - maybe that will make the difference.

This cake turned out pretty good.  I used frozen blueberries instead of the cranberries and used a Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker to bake it in.  It took about 45 minutes or so to cook it in that.  Will make again and maybe even try another berry or even some other fruit.

This was an excellent dessert.  The cake part was a bit dry, but the cranberry topping seeped down over the cake and it was even better the next day.  Plus, it makes a very impressive presentation.

I think the batter was a bit dry, but the topping was good. I cooked the cranberries in the sugar before I put them in the pan.

So good I made  it twice.  Added the cranberries and pecans to the pan before adding the brown sugar mixture - no leaking.  I found the first batch a little flat but still really tasty.  Added cranberries to the batter for the second and it was just excellent.  Also try the streusel topping.  When you flip it there's a nice slightly crunchy crust and a gooey top.  Just perfect.

This cake is one of the prettiest I've ever made.  Perfect for the holidays!  And it tasted great too...received a ton of compliments!  I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding a bit more cranberries & pecans) and had no problems.  I wrapped the pan in foil and put a cookie sheet under it just in case, but only a tiny bit leaked out into the foil.  Will definitely make this again.

Thank you, thank you, thank you Marjorita for sharing this fantastic recipe.  The best coffee cake ever.  Had family in for dessert/coffee and the cake disappeared before our eyes.  Everybody wanted the recipe.  No need to make any changes here, just follow the recipe and enjoy all the compliments you will receive.  Will make this one over and over.

I won’t make it again, even though my husband and guests liked it. It does taste good, but cleaning up the springform pan was a bear. Luckily I placed a pan under the heavy duty foil I put around the pan or  I would have had more cleaning to do!  Even though I sprayed the pan the cake still stuck to the bottom and sides and so did not make a nice display when turned upside down. Be sure to check it hike cooking. Mine turned out dry and the cranberries were not a bright color even though I set the timer for the prescribed time.. Sorry. Too much preparation for the trouble.

Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again.

Had to substitute walnuts for the pecans because my store was out of pecans. Was just as tasty.

I followed the ingredient list exactly but made it in a regular cake pan upon another reviewer’s recommendation. Also, since  it was for Christmas morning, I put the cranberry topping in the cake pan the night before and stored it in the refrigerator. The cake mixture went in the refrigerator as well in a separate bowl. The next morning I poured the cake mixture on the cranberry topping and baked it while we opened presents. It worked out perfect and the family said let’s have it every year.

I made as directed. Came out of the pan easily, which surprised me!  Made a beautiful presentation.  BUT not very sweet at all.  This usually doesn't  bother me, but it was rather bland.  I think if you added the vanilla sauce, or some thing sweet it would  complement it well.  Will probably not make again.

I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour. I used Demerara sugar instead of white sugar. I was out of baking soda, so used 3 tsp of baking powder as a substitute. It smelled delicious and couldn't wait until breakfast to try it! I plan to make it again.

Love this cake!  I did take time to review all of the reviews and tips and adjusted the following:  Chopped half of the cranberries and mixed in with the whole berries and added the zest of one orange before layering on the sugar mix.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract and more orange zest to the batter.  I baked for 30 mins at 350° and then lowered the temp to 325° once it had risen and baked for an additional 40 minutes. Will definitely be making this again!

I've made it several times, each time there was some minor issues.  The taste though is always top notch. 
Thanksgiving 2019 version has the most problem: the bottom sugar is burned.  In the picture, you can see the caramelized sugar forming a crystal layer.  Still taste good but less appealing. Also there is a lot of extra butter and it's dripping out of the pan, and not incorporated into the cranberry layer.

Fabulous!  The entire family loved it.  Followed recipe except I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese diluted with some milk, I don't think I noticed any difference.   
 Very beautiful - great for making a statement with guest.

I made it exactly as given in the recipe, except for adding about one third cup of milk to the batter for a less dense consistency. It came out perfectly, and plenty pretty for me! Will definitely be making again, but might double the batter or make in a smaller pan... It's a flatter  cake than we like.

I made this coffee cake for a Christmas Brunch and it was a BIG hit.  It was a beautiful addition to the table.  Everyone loved it.  And It stayed moist for days after the first cut.  

I made it the second time for a friends’ coffee gathering. It is a great way to use leftover fresh cranberries.  My friends loved it and asked for th receipe.  

Another great receipe from Allrecipes!  Thank you !

I will definitely be making this again!  However, I only gave this 4 stars because I accidentally left out 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the topping.  After tasting it, I felt if I had added that 1/3 cup, it would have been too sweet, for me.  Everyone who had some said it was very good.  The cake part was very good, but after reading other reviews, I did lower the temperature to 325, but at 65 minutes, took it out, when the toothpick came out clean.  As other reviewers, I should have left it in about 10 minutes longer, but the top was getting very brown, at that point. I'd like to try it in a loaf pan, as a bread, as it had that consistency.  The overall flavor was 5 stars!  Even the batter!

Made this last night for this morning's coffee time at church.
I used blueberries and walnuts  because it's summer in Maine. Can't wait to try it with cranberries.......it was delicious.  I baked it in a 9" square pan and it was fine

I love cooking which only a teen so took forever for me make this. It looks weird when  you make all the stuff. But when you cook it all looks amazing! Only thing I recommend you doing is putting more cranberries in it. Why because you barely can taste it. Also my mom didn’t have any pecans which taste fine without it.

I have made this recipe twice and it was beautiful and delicious. It only took 40 minutes to cook in my oven so I'm glad I checked it early. I got lots of compliments on this cake. I swapped non-fat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream on my second time making it and you would never be able to tell the difference.

I used more cranberries and toasted the pecans.  I also added chopped cranberries into the cake batter.  Got rave reviews...but even better, I liked it myself!  This cake is very moist and really tasty. I should mention that, like others, my foil did appear to leak as there is moisture on the floor of my oven; but since it turned out so perfectly I'm not sure whether or not I will use a cookie sheet when I bake it again (and I will definitely be baking it again!). This is a good reason to freeze fresh cranberries at Christmas!

I had some left over cranberries and was looking for something different to make.  This recipe caught my eye. I followed the recipe as stated. Wow was I surprised. This recipe is a keeper. The flavors go so well together. The cake is moist and light. I had to put it away because I couldn't stop eating it. The cranberries and pecans go so well together, the tartness of the berries, the butter,  pecans and brown sugar, amazing.

Cooked it in my cast iron frying pan.  I added about 2 cups of cranberries but otherwise followed amounts.  Melted butter and sugar in frying pan, removed from heat and added nuts and cranberries.  Excellent dessert which cooked in 35 minutes at 350F.

This is both delicious and just beautiful! I made a small loaf for a Secret Santa exchange gift (along with some local coffee and a Christmas mug) and a larger loaf for a small Christmas brunch. I used chopped walnuts and added some milk. I can't turn it upside down but if I could, I myself would "ooh" and "ahh"! 
It was easy to follow and can be made in less than an hour if you make smaller portions.

I wanted to get rid of all the cranberries in my cupboard and found this recipe I did use canned whole cranberries..... A little tart for my taste but it is excellent next time I'll use a different fruit but super good for being what it is!!!...... I also added a glaze icing on top I think that helped the tartness a tiny bit and made my sweet tooth happy.... almost forgot I took the recommendation from the other reviews and baked it at 325°for an hour, after checking it I then baked for another twenty min

I wanted to try it out to see if it is something I should make for Thanksgiving... and I am adding it to my list!!!
I didn't bake mine for an hour (I used a glass baking sheet, so that might have sped up the process. It was done in 45 minutes). It is SUPER tasty. Everyone loved it :)

I was dissapointed in the flavor of the cake itself.  I will use another recipe for the cake and just use the cranberry pecan part of this recipe to make this in the future.  The cake was not moist, had an odd feel to the palate, and the cinnamon took too much away from the cranberries.  I would much rather have this topping on a dense super moist white coffee cake.

This cake was fabulous! I took it to a dinner and everyone enjoyed it. I baked it at 325 F for 70 minutes as suggested by another reviewer, and that worked out well. I made some substitutions to avoid food allergies in our home. Switched out the two eggs for 1/2 cup of applesauce, and I traded out the pecans for sunflower seeds. I might consider toasting the sunflower seeds in the future to give them more crunch.

We LOVE this cake!!! I have made it twice in one week; it is easy and one of the best coffee cake recipes I have ever found. Cranberries add the perfect tartness to balance the sweetness. 

Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

This is one of those perfect recipes. It was very easy to make. It tastes amazing (especially if you aren't into super sweet things like myself). And it looks like something you'd buy at a fancy downtown bakery. This was my pre-T'giving breakfast practice run and the only thing I'm changing for the "Big Show" is to be a tad more persnickety about the placement of the cranberries and nuts just for added visual appeal.

YUM!

i love cranberries and cranberry season, so naturally, i love finding recipes that work my favorite berries into a delectable dish. this was great. i used walnuts instead of pecans and followed directions pretty much to a t (i also added about 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of just 1/2). tart and wonderful, warm and crisp. this was awesome!

This did not turn out well! The outside of the cake was baked and even began to burn in 40 minutes and the middle was still completely raw. I ended up scooping all of the middle out and throwing it away. We managed to get a few pieces from the ends. This should have baked at a lower temperature so the ends to not burn before the middle of the cake is cooked. I gave three stars because it would have tasted really good if it baked right.
