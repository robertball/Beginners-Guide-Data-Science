I had a recipe like this which I used for years as did my church ladies group, but we added 1 can of cream of chicken soup to the mix, believe me it makes all the difference in the world! I tried this out of curiosity, and it was greasy, bland, underdone, and not really as good as my old recipe. I also topped mine with a combination of Ritz crackers and cheddar cheese (do NOT use low cal mayo or cheese in this - it doesn't work).

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for months, meaning to try it out.  I made it tonight, and it's a winner!  My mom made a dish similar to this, which is what prompted me to try it.  The cashews were fun.  I used half light mayo, and it turned out perfect.  Still creamy.  I used about 1/3 of a red onion, chopped fine.  This, along with the celery added beautiful color.  I didn't have problems with it being too greasy, and I even added the chips (about 1/2 cup).  It's common sense that it will be a rich dish though.  We all loved it!

I made this recipe last night for my family of five after I went to the store to get everything I needed.  They all hated it.  There's so much mayo it's discusting.  I was very disappointed - not to mention, still hungry.

Great casserole!  We omit the potato chips (not neccessary!), which really cuts down on the greasy-ness factor.  And if it still seems like it might be too rich, use low-fat mayo!  My family LOVES this salad!  (and no, it's not a "Sandwich" chicken salad, but would be great with a good green salad on the side and a nice crusty piece of bread!  :)

Interesting recipe...it had good flavor and crunch but was very greasy.  Is this a sandwich salad recipe?

I was a little dissappointed by this recipe. With the ingredients it sounded pretty tasty. Not that it was really bad, it was just ok. It was pretty greasy and I didnt use the full amount of chips called for. I probably wont be making this again.

This recipe is way too rich as is-- tons of mayonnaise, salty cashews and chips, cheddar cheese.  It almost made me sick an hour after I ate it.  Although the meal is flavorful if you like chicken salad, I would reduce the amount of mayonnaise by A LOT before making this again!  The other liquid ingredients (including the melted cheese) will make up for the lost mayonnaise.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand--no celery,I used walnuts instead of cashews, and it was great! I also used light mayo and eased up on the cheese and chips. My daughter (AKA Ms. Pickyeater) gobbled it up!

This was a very good casserole.  I used light mayo and it was a bit dry.  I will use regular next time.  I will definate make again, on our menu now.

I modified the recipe and while edible, this was not memorable.  It's similar to a paula deen recipe.  After people said it was greasy, I just used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 of that low fat and 1/2 full fat.  I didn't add salt because it would have been too salty (it could have used a little though).  I used walnuts instead of cashews because I had them.  I also used 2% cheese mexican blend (what I had on hand).  I only used 3/4 c. of celery.  I added 1/2 a chopped jalepeno and some hot sauce.  It's very easy and does the job, but just wasn't very interesting.  And it didn't serve 6, just me and my husband and enough for me to eat cold for lunch the next day.

I've made this wonderful dish for my family as well as taken it to covered dish socials many times. I make a double batch at home and my four children love it, leaving no leftovers. As for the covered dish socials, I'm always asked being this chicken salad along with the recipe to share with others who will be trying it for the first time. The key to success on this dish though, is don't mess with the ingredients! It is great just the way it is!!

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great too! I like that it didn't have a ton complicated ingredients and mile long instructions. Now I know what to do with the potato chips that are left in the bottom of the bag!

This dish was definitely heart attack food! I think you could defintitely cut down on the mayo a bit and serve alongside a nice, crisp green salad to offset the fat. It tasted good though.

This just didn't work for me.  I used canned chicken, which may have had something to do with it (the chicken flavor was too prominent).  It tasted like warm chicken with mayo and that's about it.

Love this recipe! I enjoy the many tastes and textures it offers. If you are worried about the calories or cholesterol - use low fat ingredients.
Thanks Doreen!

My grandma use to make something like this when I was little and I wanted to find a recipie like it. This one was good except I cut back on the mayo  just eyeballing it. Myboyfriend (who likes everything spicy) suggested canned green chilies. All and all it was a good recipie that I will make again
