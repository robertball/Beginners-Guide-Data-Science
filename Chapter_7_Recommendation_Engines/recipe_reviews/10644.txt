These cookies are great!! I gave this to several people, and EVERYONE loved it!!  The only thing I did different was to put it in different order because I didn't want the flower mix or sugar to seep down, and I wanted the raisins to be at the top incase they didn't want raisins in their cookies.  The layer order I used was: flour mixture (bottom), brown sugar, white sugar, rolled oats, then the raisins.  All in all, a FANTASTIC recipe!!  My 1 1/2 year old son LOVED them (he cried when there was no more!!) so we give this one a 2 thumbs up!!

Did this for a church bake & craft sale.  Decorated the jar, put it on a tray and surrounded it with baked cookies.  Followed the advice on order: 1)flour, 2)brown sugar, 3)white sugar, 4)oats, then 5)raisins.  Looked terrific, tasted wonderful and sold very well!  Thanks Lisa for another great looking and great tasting Cookie in a Jar Recipe!  Tip: Don't buy the baking raisins that are "moisture rich" for the jar.  They are great in the cookies, but look much to moist to be sealed in the jar.

I used 1/2 a banana plus 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of an egg and butter flavored shortening plus 4 1/2 tsp water instead of butter and they were absolutely fabulous.  Banana adds a unique flavor that goes well with the ingredients.  Got nothing but rave reviews and requests for more!

I tested this recipe to use for gifts and was so suprized! They are easy to make and SO tasty.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  I used a regular cookie sheet, no parchment paper, and waited just a few minutes after removing from the oven to remove from the cookie sheet.  It worked fine.  I also made them with chocolate chips... mmmmnnn!!!
They stayed moist for a couple of days and didn't dry out.  Two thumbs up!!!!

This a great cookie! One of the best oatmeal cookie I ever seen in print....Even better than my old secret one I have used for 35 years...Does anyone know the shelf life when given as a gift?  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

wonderful, fragrant, crisp yet chewy cookies.  i made a batch of these around midnight and they were all gone by noon of the next day.  

that night i made another batch, modifying the recipe to my taste (it was a bit too sweet) by just cutting out the white sugar, and now it's perfect.

Fast and easy gift - and people have been raving. I made several jars and played with the order of the layers. I like it best with the oats on top so it's not such a vast expanse of oat color. 
Pack it well!

Yummy cookies.  However, since nobody I know likes raisin cookies, I used chocolate chips.  Doing that made it not fit into the jar, so I had to scale the recipe down.  I was not sure how the spices would taste with the chips, but they turned out great!

Great cookies, easy to make. I melted the margarine used 1/2c with old fashioned oats, but needed 2 Tbls more for quick cooking, they stick together well, added 2 tsp water and substituted 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice for the nutmeg.  I think they are best with old fashioned oats, but will be using quick cooking because I bought a big box. PatLa

This is a great recipe.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins to make it more festive and they turned out great.  (Not as good as the Cranberry Hootycreeks, but still very good.)  I did have trouble fitting all the ingredients into a regular jar.  It probably would have worked better with a wide-mouthed jar.

Everyone I know loves these cookies even if they don't prefer an oatmeal raisin cookie!! I too use them often to sell as a fundraiser. The mix because it's dry ingredients will actually stay fresh as long as 2 years in jars.(made some that long ago and kept a jar just to test!) The only thing to watch is that the raisins don't clump.

Really nice to make ahead of time for those times when you crave. I substituted some dried cranberries instead of raisins.

K, I'm confused. How is 5 cups + 3 teaspoons supposed to fit in a 4 cup (1 ounce) jar?

I pushed a pushed but alas it didn't work. I ended up cutting the oats down to 1 1/2, raisins to 1/2 and sugars and flour each by a bit.

I'm giving them as gifts and I'm nervous.

Very nice gift, cookies are good.  I used powdered vanilla that I purchased on line from a spice company so that the folks I give it to won't have to add as many ingredients.

These cookies were really delicious.  I made up a double batch for my pantry and then mix up a batch when we want cookies instead of buying pre-mixed.  They had great flavour and were nice and soft.  I always substitute applesauce for the fat, and the apple added a great touch to these.

I used this recipe for the cookie mix in a jar craft this week for our Mothers of Preschoolers group. It went over really well. I made up a batch last night as a "tester" and the cookies are really good. My husband likes them and he is not a fan of Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I have some more in the oven right now! Thanks for a great recipe.

YUMMY!  I gave these to all my friends, including the office.  Big hit.  I used dried cranberries and made each jar individually.  Ran out of cranberries on the last two and used chocolate chips instead.  Works fine if you follow Lisa's order (cranberries or chips after flour). QUESTION: Has anybody tried mixing together a bunch of the flour mixture to save doing that step each time?  Do you then still measure just one cup?

When making them t home I actually substitute the 3/4 cups of raisins for 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup cranberries and call them trailmix cookies. mmmmmmmm, taste just like the ones from Tim Hortons

I didn't actually bake the cookies, but I did package them and give them away as gifts and got rave reviews.  I ended up seperating the two cups of oatmeal. I added the first cup and then the sugars and then the second cup at the top.  It was easier to squish everything into the jar that way.

Very nice presentation, however, the next time I will put the white sugar in first, oats next, then brown sugar, flour and raisins.  I don't like putting the flour on top of something it can leak down into.

For a Christmas treat - I swaped the raisins for dried Cranberries - fantastic, and the spices in the cookies go well with the cranberries. I love this recipe, and have used it for a few years now.  I started by giving the jars for Christmas presents - and to a friend with a new baby, they loved them. I have since been making this recipe over and over as its good value - you get a lot of cookies out of it and I haven't found anyone who doesn't love them yet.

I am making these as Christmas gifts and decided to try a batch to taste test...awesome flavor! I did have great difficulty fitting everything into a wide-mouthed quart jar. I realized after that I used quick-cooking oats and I used chocolate covered raisins rather than plain. Are the rolled oats smaller than the quick-cooking? The smell is wonderful while they bake...If anyone can comment on the use of the oats I'd love to read it.

I made 24 jars last night for gifts.  They turned out great.  My only suggestion is to switch the order of the raisins and the oats.  The raisins tend to sink into the flour and then you can't see them. And don't pack too much, I saw some people say they did not have enough room, but when I packed everything down really tight, I actually had too much space left at the top.
Update: Everyone loved them!

These are, by far, the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever.  My husband loves them.  We don't just make them for gifts!  They are moist and chewy. These are the absolute best!

very good recipe.  I did only a half a batch to see if it would turn out.  Easy to make and most ingredients you would have on hand.  Would make a great gift as well for the holidays or hostess gift.

These were delicious!  I'm tossing my regular oatmeal cookie recipe!  Looked very pretty in the jar. I followed others suggestions and layered flour, brown sugar, white sugar, oats and raisins.

I make these as small holiday gifts to co-workers and close friends.  I haven't made the cookies yet, but a friend of mine did and she said that they were good.  I like how the different ingredients looked in the mason jar.  They really presented very well. Thank you for this great holiday idea.

The only problem I had was due to being at High Altitude.  I simply added 1/2 C. flour to the mix and it came out perfect!  There was plenty of room in the jar for the extra flour.  Everyone at the craft show loved the mini-samples I baked.

I was really looking forward to using this recipe, but I was very disappointed with the results. The cookies were flat and greasy, that is NOT a good oatmeal cookie. I would never give this as a gift much less make it at home. I ended up crumbling the entire batch into granola instead.

I like Oatmeal Cookies, but they wouldn't be my firt choice when making cookies. I made them for my husband, he loves Oatmeal Cookies. We all LOVED these. This is the BEST Oatmeal Cookie recipe I have EVER had! I used Imitation Vanilla Butter & Nut that I found at our local Food Lion and they were sooooo good - make you want to smack your Grandma! I can't wait to make them up as gifts. Thank you!

This recipe is great!  It looks good in a jar.  It tastes great, and baking them on parchment paper is so easy.  They are crisp and chewy.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  They are out of this world.  The only difference is that I didn't use parchment paper, just a regular non-stick cookie pan, and the cookies spread out really thin, and were wafer-like and really chewy.  I couldn't be happier about this recipe.  Maybe if I used parchment, they wouldn't have spread so much? Terrific cookies either way.

I made this as a gift to give to all the people at my son's daycare for the Holiday's and it was a huge success. I made a batch to test out as well and brought them in to work. I can honestly say these were the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had and everyone who tried them loved them.  I made no modifications to the ingredients themselves, just the order of the layers. I used the order suggested in the first comment (flour mixture on the bottom followed by, brown sugar, white sugar, oats and raisins on top). The jars looked great. You do have to make sure you pack the layers tight so that everything fits. Turned out great all around and will definitely be my holiday gift for next year as well.

I made 12 of these for Christmas gifts this year. I made sure I saved one for myself, so I could at least try them. I baked them up last night and OH MY. They were SO DELICIOUS. I stopped counting how many I ate. These were seriously the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. They were nice and soft to bite into. Wow. Can't wait to make them again!

mmmmmm, what a delicious recipe! i made up 2 jars as christmas presents then baked a batch so the recipients would have a dozen cookies each for sampling. the ingredients fit fine inside the mason jars (using old fashioned oats, not quick oats) & the layered effect was very pretty. these cookies taste perfect, i wouldn't change a thing. one note: my yield was 2 1/2 cookies. many thanks lisa!

Besides this being a really cool gift the recipe is really good. I made the cookies for the gang at work and they just loved them. Easy to make and bakes up really well. The nutmeg adds a very nice touch. You can't go wrong with this one.

This is a very nice oatmeal cookie recipe.  It makes chrispy, flat oarmeal cookies with a nice flavor.  I would put less nutmeg in it next time or omit all together.  I only give it 4 stars because I prefer a more robust oatmeal cookie.  My favourite oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is still the one from the classic Better Homes Cookbook.  It is similar to this recipe but has no nutmeg and calls for baking powder and more flour.  Cloves are optional.  I am sure you could adapt that recipe for a jar too.

I made a jar of these yesterday and baked them up today.  Flat and greasy.  I won't be giving these out for the holiday.  My search continues.

The mix came together quickly and looked good-perfect for a last minute gift.  I got resounding compliments from all who made/ate them.  This will be a keeper-I may even keep a few jars in the freezer for emergencies.

These remind me of the oatmeal cookies that I had growing up, but which were made with oil rather than butter or margarine.  I thought they were okay, certainly fine for lunch boxes, but nowhere near as good as the oatmeal raisin recipe that I usually use.  I think I'll try to make my own version of this, as the gift-giving idea is fantastic and the presentation is beautiful.

I made these for a baby shower and they were a huge hit!  I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins though, and liked them better.  Who doesn't like a cookie?!

I was using this recipe to give as gifts but, of course, wanted to be sure that the cookies tasted good.  Well, let me tell you, they are DELICIOUS and super easy to make.  They are my families absolute favorite and because they are so easy, I don't mind making them all the time...which is what they seem to want me to do!

Super good and very addictive. I just found they were a bit too buttery. I made these as gifts 2 years ago and I still have a few jars, so I made one today and they definitely stay good. For my next batch I might add chocolate chips and cut the butter down a bit. Still a great cookie though. Don't know what people are talking about being flat, mine are no flatter than a normal cookie and very soft and chewy.

These were great cookies.  The recipe is correct when it states that you *need* a quart sized jar - I tried my best to sqeeze it into something smaller but it just didn't go.  The cookies themselves were moist and flavourful!

I've had these cookies mixed up since Christmas. It's a cold snowy day in Pa. so I decided to bake these. they were so easy to mix up and bake and one of the most delicious oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. Cripsy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Yum!!! I will definately make these up for gifts for others as well as myself.

This recipe is absolutly delicious!  I gave it a test run before making 60 jars as the favor for a bridal shower.  They were a big hit!  I would highly recomend this recipe, even if it's just for you to bake--forget the jar!  :)

This recipe deserves 10 stars. Tastes like a cookie you would buy at a specialty cookie store. They are moist even after a week of storage. I used old-fashioned oats. I gave this as Christmas gifts and they were a hit! I can't stress enough how good these are.

This is a easy and tasty recipe.  I added a cup of cranberries instead of the rasins, added some semi-sweet chocolate chips and a bunch of chopped walnut and coconuts. I tone down the spice a bit (using a dash instead of measuring them).  I love oatmeal cookies, this would be the second best recipe I have... my first choice is still the Martha Stewarts version.  Nonetheless... These are good soft oatmeal cookies, will definately make them again.

One of my favorite cookie mix in a jar recipes.  
I just packed everything in very tightly.  It does fit.
I add the raisins last.

Best oatmeal cookies ever! These are also amazing if you trade the raisins for a combo of white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. I am grateful for my KitchenAid mixer everytime I make these,however. The dough is super hard to mix.

Excellent recipe! I used Splenda baking sugar and added some chopped nuts. The batter is very gooey and quite messy but makes a great cookie. I can't wait to share them for Christmas gifts.
