I make this all the time.  Any cut of beef will work. Also, I just use the Aujus Garvy and Italian Dressing mix, then add water instead of boullion.  It is salty enough with just the mixes.  The juice is perfect for a French Dip sandwich.  This is my go to on busy days.  I dont even thaw the meat sometimes, I just throw it in the crock pot frozen...YUMMY...!!!!!!

I also add garlic and Kitchen Bouquet with a mixture of Wondra flour and water for gravy. Superb!

Well, tried to make as written as I am one of the first reviewers...turned out I didn't have an onion (thought I did, so didn't buy one), So I used some onion powder. It smelled great, and tasted pretty good. I think it's worth a try, but I won't make it again, and I don't think the onion thing made that big of a difference.

If the recipe calls for a chuck roast,  then show that in the photo.  The cut of beef shown is clearly no chuck roast i have ever used.

I rarely use processed/packaged food but I needed something that I could throw into the slow cooker with little preparation so I decided to try this one.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and could not be happier.  This was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait until tonight to use the leftovers for french dip sandwiches.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  We love it and will use it a lot.

I've never written a review, but this recipe is awesome. And so easy! I didn't even have the au jus seasoning, and I don't think it was even needed.  I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic, baby carrots and Red potatoes, cut in half and unpeeled.  Instead of salt and pepper, I sprinkled McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides, but don't over do it. I browned the meat on all sides first in a small amount of bacon fat that I had saved. Be sure to scrape all the pan drippings into the crock pot. I thought it would be nice to have a lot of gravy for "open faced" beef sandwiches on rolls so I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a can of water.  Wow! I never would have thought Good Season's dry Italian Salad Dressing could pack so much flavor. I see no reason to even try another recipe for slow cooker beef.  This is it for me. Thank you!

Wonderful recipe.  I added one 10 oz can of low sodium stewed tomatoes and 1/4 cup of banana peppers. Cooked on low for 8 hours.

I have made this recipe for a few years now. I do not add broth just water (about 4 cups) because there is enough flavor from the au jus packet. I also throw in mushrooms for more deliciousness. Makes a great sandwich on toasted hoagie too.

This is a great slow cooker recipe for beef. But please, do NOT add salt to this dish. Between the beef broth (even if low sodium), the au jus mix and the italian seasoning mix, you will have more than enough sodium in this recipe. 
I use a 6 quart slow cooker (another reviewer asked what size to use) and I do sear my roast in pan prior to putting in the slow cooker. Then I saute the onion and a few minced cloves of garlic in the pan, deglaze with the beef broth and pour all over the roast. Scrumptious!! And no, your roast will not look like the picture that accompanies this recipe. That roast was NOT made in a slow cooker and it isn't even a chuck roast. Why it accompanies this recipe is a mystery.

I have been using this receipt for years.  Add potatoes and carrots if you like.  Also cook it a little longer and pull it apart with a fork and add bar-b-que sauce.  Great for parties.

We added a small jar of sweet banana peppers, and browned the roast on all sides before putting it into the crock pot so that it would not be dry.  I did not have the au Jus packet on hand, so made it without that.  Will use this over and over as a main meal during fall and winter, especially to use for several meals on the weekend.

I omit extra salt, with all those packets of dry mix.  I like to add no-salt added tomatoes of any sort too.

I grew up hating roast. My mom made it often and it was dry and stringy. I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot bcuz my new husband loves red meat. It was AMAZING!! Tender and juicy, it pulled apart with little more than a poke. And the Au Jus is the bomb! We made French Dips with it (+hoagie rolls & pepperjack cheese) and it was gobbled up! Even my teenage son, who usually refuses to eat red meat, had an entire sandwich and asked me to save him some leftovers. This one's a winner and we'll definitely have it again!! (Made exactly like recipe, but used a 14.5 oz can of beef broth)

I followed this recipe to a tee and I loved it! I'm following a low carb diet and was really craving a cheesesteak sub, so I melted cheese in my portion and it really hit the spot. Next time, I'll omit the salt because it was a little too salty for my taste but this recipe will definitely be added to my repertoire!

This recipe is a keeper, but should be called a pot roast recipe.  Made a few changes:  added 1/2 cup of red wine.  Used low-sodium beef broth.  Added 1# pkg of frozen peas, 8-10 small red potatoes cut in half, 2 cups sliced mushrooms, 1# pkg of baby carrots.  Cooked on high setting for 6-1/2 hours.

My entire family loved this recipe! It was easy to make and very flavorful. We made it with garlic mashed potatoes. Perfect combination. We will be adding this to our meal menu for sure.

I have not made this particular recipe but have had similar and loved it.  I have not been able to make it, though.  Does anyone know what size crock pot I should be using?  Mine comes out very dry and stringy.  Should I be using a smaller slow cooker?

I also have a problem with the photo.  Not a slow cooked piece of beef and not the chuck cut.  Does look delicious.......

Making this right now, with a few alterations. I season roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and stuff with fresh garlic before placing in cooker. I also add Worcestershire and frozen seasoning mix (onions, bell peppers and celery). Next time I'll cut out the salt and use beef broth instead. I love this easy main dish!

I liked this well enough but, truth be told, I have to say I was a little let down.  I was enthusiastic about the ingredients, specifically the addition of the Italian salad dressing mix, which I assumed would lend great flavor.  It’s not something I ever use or buy but did so just for this recipe.  Had I not put this together myself I would have never known it was in there.  Better flavor contributions, I found, were the glug of red wine and sliced fresh mushrooms I added.    I’m not sure this would have tasted any differently simply omitting both the au jus and Italian salad dressing mixes.  Note:  Since I wanted this for slicing I used a rump roast rather than chuck roast.  I refrigerated it overnight for ease in slicing.  Also, I didn’t add the 1/2 tsp. salt which I knew would be overkill considering the salt already in the other ingredients called for.  Good call.

I thought that this was outstanding. I followed others' advice and used 4 cups of water instead of the beef broth. After my meat was done, I put the liquid on the stove with some flour to thicken it up and make some really good gravy. My family loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is incredibly easy to make. Due to other reviews about too much salt, I omitted the broth (used water instead) and salt. Since I was using this recipe for french dip sandwiches, when it was done cooking, I sliced the meat (used eye of round roast) very thin, put on french rolls, place provolone cheese on it, and broiled the sandwiches for a minute or two and used the juice for dipping. Next time if I plan to use it for sandwiches again, I would omit the onion and reduce the amount of dry dressing mix because the au jus tasted a bit like gravy which is what it is intended for if you eat it like a regular roast. For sandwiches I would tweak, for regular roast, I would do it the same way again.

I made this on the fly, having a thawed roast and no energy to cook it on a Wednesday night at 9:30.  Given my predicament, I was of course missing one ingredient, the package dry Italian salad dressing mix, so I improvised, using Italian Seasoning and Roasted Garlic and Peppers seasoning and it still turned out fabulous!  I will try it the directed way the next time as I'll have more time to plan, but what a beautiful roast it made!  So, so flavourful, so tender!  A definite hit!

Came home to the smell of this roast ready and waiting as we walked in the door.  The meat was tender, delicious and quickly gobbled up by the family.  Made exactly as written, I thickened gravy a bit prior to serving.  Quick, simple, keeper recipe...thank you!

I tried this for New Year's and it was AMAZING! Let it cook for about 8.5 hours and it definitely pleased the crowd!

I'm not sure what I did wrong...but the meat was dry and rather tasteless... followed the instructions and cooked on low for 8 hours. After 6 it was completely cooked and dry...wish I could say I loved it as I was so excited to try it!

Made with a Chuck Loin Roast as written except the au jus packet and I browned the meat; it was great. Used the liquid to make a delicious pan gravy. Will use this recipe again!

Thought that the recipe was a great idea... Have even added a cup of red wine to the recipe to give it a fuller flavor.

OK, so I hate when people rate it but didn't make as instructed but this is worth 5 stars either way.  I did change a few things but I think this is an excellent and easy base recipe.  What I changed was I used onion soup mix in place of au jus and onion because it is what I had on hand.  And water in place of broth. Added pepper.  Prepped the night before sans water.  Let it sit in fridge overnight and added the water and cooked it the next day.   Family loved it!!!

Definitely a keeper - my picky kids loved it! Great flavor - the juices were just as delicious as the meat. I almost followed the recipe to the letter - I used 2 beef bouillon cubes, 2 cups of water and eliminated the salt. I cooked it for 8 hrs on low, but could've easily gone for 10 hrs. Can't wait to make it again!

I made one change: used water instead of broth. It was delicious. We shredded the meat, made sandwiches and used the cooking liquid as au jus for dipping. Highly recommend, especially since it was such an easy prep.

Perfect! I used an arm roast -cooked 7hrs on low. Added 1/4c wine mixed with 2TB cornstarch to sauce after removing the meat and veg. Best slow cooker roast I've ever made- ty for the recipe.

Delicious! Made it with a chuck roast which I browned in olive oil & garlic before putting it in the slowcooker. I added in small red potatoes & carrots. Only added in 1/2 package of each seasoning and 1/2 can beef consume 1/2 can water. Perfect!! cooked on low for about 5 1/2 hours

With apologies to the creator of this recipe--I followed the directions EXACTLY (adding cut up red potatoes and carrots) and it was so salty that my family would not eat it. Very disappointing.

Used 2/3 bottle of fat free Zesty Italian dressing instead of the dry mix. 1/2 can low sodium beef broth, 2 large onions quartered, 12 oz of sliced mushrooms, and the rest of the listed ingredients sans salt.

Used corn starch with the remaining broth and it made a great sauce for smashed potatoes. It was a big hit at my house. I will add carrots the next time for even better results.

This was delicious!  I used a rump roast since that's all I had.  I also did not use the beef broth in order to reduce the sodium content, just 4 cups of water like some others suggested and I did not add any additional salt and it was perfect!!

Delicious!!  I did make a few changes.  I didn't use the dry au jus since I couldn't find any without hydrolyzed soy protein ( which we try to avoid), and instead of the beef broth I used beef stock and added enough to completely cover the roast.  I added mushrooms on top and otherwise followed the recipe. It was extremely succulent and tender. My whole family loved it!

When I made this for a holiday-season birthday party, my family chowed down to a ridiculous extent - some people had three sandwiches! I guess this got their seal of approval! They raved, and all decided that this is our go-to sandwich from now on. It was very easy, and smelled amazing while cooking. I placed provolone and pepper jack cheese slices along with jalapenos and peperoncini to the side. Loved it, and will use the recipe forever!

This is a great basic recipe.  I also add 3-4 cloves minced garlic.  I always cook this the day before I want to serve it.  When it is tender, I let the roast cool until I can handle it and pour the liquid into a large measuring cup and refrigerate.  Then I remove all fat, gristle, bones, etc. from the meat by hand.   In the process of doing this, I manually shred the beef.  I refrigerate the meat and broth separately because I want all the fat to harden on the top of the broth so I can discard it.  On the day I want to serve this beef, I put the meat and broth back in the crockpot and let it reheat on high.  The shredded meat soaks up all the flavors from the broth while it's reheating.

My husband brought home a similar recipe but it called for Italian Good  Seasons but since we couldn’t always find the Garlic dressing we used garlic salt. It called for generous shakes  of Worcestershire and a can of beer and equal amount of water. We cooked until tender and shredded for sandwiches or served with vegetables.
I also used wine instead of beer. It was easy to thicken for gravy or use as au jus for French Dip.  It has always been our go-to simple meal. The leftovers are great for soup base.

I could not find the Au jus packet.. so I used a packet of beefy onion mix.. skipped the onion because of the dried onion in the mix.. used spicy ranch packet and just enough beef broth to cover the bottom.. let it slow cook for 8 hours.. it was delicious!! My husband is not a big pot roast fan. I have used different recipes in the past 30 years.. but, he definitely said this one was his favorite as it had the most flavor and wasn’t bland.  Obviously, I will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out wonderful. only change I made was to use some italian seasoning, garlic powder and basil instead of packaged italian dressing. Chuck roast cut was key and I was glad to have stuck to that cut.

Delicious!!! The change I made was using about one cup of beef broth, half a cup of red wine, three tbsp soya sauce and one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I seasoned with steak seasoning and browned about four minutes per side and cooked in slow cooker on high for five hours. Removed from slow cooker and added about half a cup of potato flakes to juices to thicken. No other seasoning required.

Simple and savory.  The meat is tender, flavorful and the juices become great gravy with it.  A good basic roast seasoning that you can add your favorite veggies to.  Leftovers are very tasty shredded and used for open face sandwiches.

I made this yesterday according to the recipe, except I omitted the salt as some others suggested. We all loved it! My husband just raved about it. I added baby carrots and cut up potatoes on top of the roast and cooked it for 8 hours on low. Will definitely be making this again!

Loved the way this recipe turned out. Pleasantly surprised it wasn't too salty. I didn't add the salt just in case. I did add 1/2 a bag of baby carrots.  I will definately make again.

I love it! i didn't use au jus mix; I just used 2 cups of beef broth. It was fantastic! Very easy to make and an excellent "leftover dish!"

I just made this recipe without the salt after reading the reviews. Also, I added garlic, red potatoes and carrots. I browned the meat in bacon fat like someone had suggested also. Haven't tried it yet but it looks and smells like it's going to have a lot of flavor!

WOW!!! First, you need to know that roasts are one of my least favorite foods. I now think I'm in love!!! Prepared as written (with the exception of making my own italian dressing and au jus mix, crock pot for 10 hours) in the recipe and this is one awesome roast. Thought left overs would be good in a sandwich, but it doesn't look like there will be any leftovers. A 4lb beef roast, baby carrots and petite red potatoes and this fed our family of 5 to one great meal. Still going back to the serving platter sneaking just one more bite! This was "lick your plate" good!!! The only way I will ever prepare beef roast in the future. 
I've finally conquered the dreaded, boring, tasteless roast. Thanks!!! Gotta go, still a few bites left...

I tried this one and my husband and I really liked it. I follow it exactly, but you could make it without the broth and it would still turn out fine. We pair it with roast potatoes and the recipe 'Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes'. It is a dinner we look forward to!

Love this recipe. I find the Italian spices a little too much for me so I cut it back a bit, other than that same everything and makes a plain roast delicious.

The best slow cooked roast I've ever tried. Will make again. I browned both sides of roast and just used half of italian dressing mix. Really good over rice.

Made this for Sunday dinner. Very easy to put together. I added some baby carrots and potatoes. Really did not need the added salt and I will leave that out the next time I make it. Even better flavor the next day.

I made this in my Instant Pot . Used a deer roast instead of chuck roast. I increased the beef broth to 3 cups of better than bouillon . I didn't have au jus so I used a pack of Pioneer brown gravy mix. I also added 8 oz of fresh mushrooms. My husband loved it.

Delicious, juicy, and flavorful. Very easy to make and customize for individual preference. I used two types of gravy mix, instead of just aus jus.

Although juicy and tender, I was expecting more of the peppery Italian roast taste in my roast.  I’ll use it for other occasions but not to fulfill my craving for Italian beef.

This was excellent! I reduced the sodium by adding 15oz of water instead of the beef broth. We made French Dip sandwiches the next day as someone recommended and this will now be a regular occurrence in my kitchen! Day 1-Italian Beef and Day 2 French dippers!!! 
I browed the roast before putting in crock pot.

An excellent recipe as is! My first time through I generally follow the directions very closely. This turned out great and even my wife's finicky taste buds really enjoyed it. Might add some veggies next time around as others suggested but this one is a keeper.

I made this for Chicago italian beefs. I’m in Houston now and was in Chicago last week to get my Vienna fixins. Hot and mild Giardinier, green relish and spot peppers.  Not to mention their hot dogs and polis sausages. This beef was a hit with my family for the beefs. I usually make the traditional roasted beef. But with this there was no slicing needed.

I made this exactly as written. I used a boneless chuck roast, cooked on low for 7 hours and it was excellent. Not dry or stringy whatsoever. 
For dinner the next day I shredded the remaining meat and made Italian Beef Sandwiches. As my husband is from Chicago, this was a huge hit.

I got an email requesting my thoughts on how this turned out.  Well, I cheated a bit. Beer, garlic and I slow-cooked it, stove top in a dutch oven, but it was wonderful. I also added pepperoncini when I reheated the leftovers.

Thank you! This was amazing and so easy, definitely my new go to for pot roast! I made a few changes just for personal preference. I browned a chuck roast before putting it in the crockpot. Took the advice of other reviewers and used water instead of beef broth. I added 1/2 can of “no salt added” tomato paste, carrots and 2 stalks of celery with the onions. I used flour to thicken the gravy and it was perfect with mashed potatoes! Never in a million years would I have thought to add a packet of Italian dressing mix! That was genius! Try it, you’ll like it!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it to be quite dry and bland. I had to serve it on soft hoagie rolls with ketchup and melted provolone to make it the least bit appealing.

My son who enjoys French Dip really liked this roast beef. All of us give it 5 Stars. I used 2 medium sized Onions instead of one, and omitted Salt (there is enough in the ingredients). I added 1 tablespoon of Orrington Farms Broth Base and Seasoning-Beef flavored mixed with the regular beef broth to give even more beef flavor.

Super tender and delicious.  We placed small (1.5 inches) cubes of potatoes around the roast instead of an onion.  Will definitely make this recipe again and again.

This was the best roast I have ever made and I have been making meals for 58 years.  We will definitely have it again and again.  I made it just as the recipe stated.  It was very tender and feel apart.  My husband said several times during out meal, "this is so good."

I would add another onion - they were delicious with the meat.

So flavorful, not my normal boiled or dry roast .  I did make the AuJus and Italian salad mixes from another recipe.  I am not usually successful in crock pots but was looking for something with flavor for sandwiches during the week, Success  !!  Its a winner

I always braise the meat in a stick of butter first and then put in cooker...butter also!  Along with the onion I also slice a couple potatoes and throw it in with the onion! This is the biggest hit in my house!! They’d rather have this than prime rib!  Easy and flavorful!!!

I hate, hate, capital H, Hate slow cooker recipes that have me doing a bunch of work in the morning, when I'm already strapped for time and the coffee hasn't kicked in and now my hands smell like garlic for the office.

This was so crazy-simple. And yes, I had to cut an onion, but that was literally ALL. And the results? WOW. This made the best beef sandwiches. I will never need another recipe for beef roast. This was amazing. The title isn't lying: Best Ever!

This is so yummy. Two changes. Rub beef with oil first for even more tenderness. Add banana peppers (1/4 cup?) for an INCREDIBLE combination of flavor! I cook a lot, and this is a top choice for me.

Great, simple, delicious. My wife loved it.
I modified by adding 2 teaspoons minced garlic, half cup of Yoshida sauce. I used very low sodium broth and did not add any salt. I also browned the cut beforehand.
It was so tender, but cooked in under 6 hrs so watch your slow cooker. I did move things around a few times during cooking. The onions carmalized so that was nice.
Cook it!

Delicious   differences are that I browned the meat as suggested by many first. As measurements and package quantities are different here 1.5 tbsp of dry jus de boeuf and 1.5 tbsp dry Italian mix plus I made beef broth from mix 3 cups or 325ml...mine was approx. 3.2lbs and cooked for 7hrs on low. Have photo but don't know if it can post on review I'll try

I have made this recipe four times and it has always been deemed delicious.  I have used chuck roasts and round roasts and the flavor is the same. I am just getting ready to share it on Facebook because several people asked me for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

Man, there was sooooo much that was wrong with this.  The Italian dressing mix made the worst taste possible for a slow cooker roast,  There wasn't much else that could possibly sustain this recipe 
What a waste of a beef roast.

Easy to prepare (altho I baised the meat).  Tasted good and very tender.  But as with most slow cooker recipes, ended up just boiling the meat.  Next time, will experiment with some additional spices.

My family loved it even the 3 and 4 year old. I took advice from other reviewers and didn't add salt. I felt it needed it at least for my taste, but glad I left it out for the kids. I added mushrooms and carrots.

I made this exactly as the directions stated but chose not to add extra salt. I used a pressure cooker because it makes the beef so nice and tender. There was a lot of liquid when it was finished so I was very happy about that. I mixed cold water and flour and added it back in and started the pressure cooker for about ten more minutes. The gravy was perfect and the overall flavor was perfect!!  Make mashed potatoes to go with this because the gravy is awesome! 
Total winner!! Thanks

I browned chopped garlic & a 1. 100 kg blade roast ($14.99kg. I  paid $16.49. (ref. ) in a large pot on my stove. I tossed in a med onion chopped & 2 cups of beef broth. I put the lid on the pot & put it in my oven for 2 1/2 hrs. When all was done I thickened the gravy. My roast ended up falling apart into tender shredded chunks. This was delicious regardless. It fed 6 adults with mashed potatoes and fresh carrots and mini buns. 
Great recipe, thank you, I'll try to take some pictures next time.

This was really good.  I did brown the meat and did not add additional salt.  The prepared products provided plenty of salt. Served with noodles.  Will make again.

I have made this recipe several times as written with the exception is that I use whatever roast is on sale. The dish is consistent no matter the cut of beef. There is very little work involved in putting the dish together and is definitely on my make again list.

Delicious! Browned the roast on all sides before putting in the crock pot. I also used just water, instead of beef broth, based on others' reviews. Added just a dash of Pinot Noir. Most definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as written and it was fantastic!  My husband told me it was delicious and that I was the best cook.  Thanks for that.  :)  I served with couscous and roasted brussels sprouts - made for a very nice meal.  Mashed potatoes would be fantastic with this, using the juices as your gravy.  We're looking forward to the leftovers!

It was great! I used a thinner cut of beef (beef round ny strip sirloin)and it was done in 6 hours. I added strips of red and green peppers. It was very tender with a great flavor.

Perfect on buns with just a smear of non-creamy horseradish. We omitted the can of broth and added a Tblsp of beef bouillon paste  because we knew the roast would release plenty of liquid. We cut the roast against the grain into pieces and browned them well before loading the slow cooker. We also skipped the salt and it was still plenty salty. The crew requested this recipe again for next week. We're happy we found a "keeper" recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Simple to make and leftovers make great sandwiches and soup base. Definitely will be added to my recipe book!

My husband and 2 kiddos did enjoy this recipe as stated above. I'm making it again tonight with  double the Italian seasoning and 3 cloves of garlic. It was great as written but we just wanted a little extra flavor. We grabbed some hoagie buns from the bakery section at the supermarket and plan to have a great dinner.

This was amazing!  I wasn't sure what to do with the chuck roast we had, so I tried this.  We couldn't stop eating it.  My only comment on the recipe is I left out the salt since I knew it would be salty enough with the au jus and good seasonings packet.

This is fantastic recipe!  It's very simple with minimum prep and the roast is delicious.  Have to agree with other reviewers that the photo isn't a chuck roast so is misleading.  But the recipe itself is a complete winner!!
