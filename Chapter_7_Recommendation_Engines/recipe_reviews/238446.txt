I used this recipe as a salsa served with grilled Salmon steaks.  My guests asked when we're having fish tacos again, because they couldn't get enough.

Yum!  Have made this twice with my 10 year old.  First time avocados were a bit more firm, and we used 4 plum tomatoes - it was just a bit better than the second time.  This time, we used riper avocados and 2 regular tomatoes - didn't look as pretty but still tasted yummy!  Good mix of flavours.

I'm glad I made this and avoided the instinct to not try it just because of the tomatoes.  It definitely all works well together!  I did not add the fresh garlic or olive oil and probably wouldn't next time I make this either.  Just personal preference.
