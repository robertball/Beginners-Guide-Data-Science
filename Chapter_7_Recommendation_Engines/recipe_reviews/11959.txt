Many other reviewers have noted that - as written - the lasagna needs to be watched carefully for appropriate cook time. That pretty much negates the benefit of a crockpot approach for me (I prefer to just start the food, then not worry about it.) What the recipe is really missing is WATER. Before assembling, mix your tomato sauce with equal parts water. Use that as your tomato mixture. With the extra water, the recipe won't turn out as dry. It will take longer to cook - about 6-8 hours on low. The benefit there is you can pretty much go to work, run errands, etc. while your food cooks. Now it makes sense as a crockpot recipe again.

We really enjoyed this!! I did some playing around with it as others have. Replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta and I used more tomato sauce and paste to make more of the sauce as I have one of the old crockpots that's just huge. I also put in some Italian seasoning and some roasted garlic. Just make sure that all your noodles are covered with the sauce and it will come out just great. The time was a little different for me too. It only took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours in my pot, but you have to remember that all crockpots are not the same, the size and shape can change the timing a great deal.  I've made this twice now and it has come out wonderful both times. I serve it with Mama D's Italian bread (from this site) and a salad and what a meal!!  Thanks Kim for a great way to make homemade lasagna without all the fuss!

This turned out very well! Delicious and filling. Of course, I had to read the reviews before attempting this. First, yes, do away with the salt entirely. The pasta sauce will have enough of it. Second, to make the cheese mixture easier to spread (I substituted fat-free ricotta for cottage cheese), add a slightly beaten egg. Finally, make sure that you are using oven-ready/no-boil lasagna noodles (don't cook them beforehand) instead of the regular kind. They will absorb the liquids and therefore cook on their own. It really does depend on your pot, but my lasagna cooked in just under four hours. The sides were slightly burned (but I like it that way... and I'm thankful I sprayed the pot with Pam before adding the ingredients). Next time I think I might add some drained canned mushrooms to the sauce to make sure that I get my serving of vegetables, since I will definitely make this again (no more Stouffer's for me).

If all items are preassembled and put in the 'fridge the night before, it needs to only be in the slow cooker for half the recommended time.

This is such a hit!  I have made it several times before and people always ask for the recipe.  Today was the first time I brought it to work and everyone raved about it.  Normally, I follow the recipe, but this time I added a big jar of Ragu to the hamburger, onion, and garlic.  I add extra mozzarella on top in the last hour so it is cheesier on top.  I also cooked it for 1 hour on low and 2 1/2 hours on high and it was wonderful.  The noodles were just right.  I will continue to make this often.  Thank you.

We did a lot of changes but loved it.  We used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage, used fresh basil in the sauce mixture, added jar sauce over the top of the filled crock pot and topped off with some of the saved mozzeralla cheese the last 30 minutes.  This is easy and a keeper.

Delicious and perfect. I feel it's a good idea to read every review if possible, at least skim them, because everyone's crockpot and experience is different and you can avoid costly mistakes. I did that and was able to make the adjustments that made this dish turn out wonderful. This was the first dish I made in my new 6-quart slow cooker (call me lasagna lover). I used 3 cups jarred spaghetti sauce, 1 cup water, and half a can diced tomatoes in juice because I had it left over from another day. I added an egg to the ricotta and used minced dried onion instead of a fresh one, and garlic powder. Also added some Italian spices, not too much, and no salt. I used 12 oz. whole wheat lasagna, the regular kind, not precooked. I cooked the whole dish on low for EXACTLY 4 hours, and it turned out heavenly. I think a lot of the problem of dry, chewy noodles comes from overcooking...do not be tempted to keep on cooking. Cover the noodles in sauce and mozzarella, and you will be fine. I didn't use the high setting at all. Will repeat often.

I substituted 2-jars of spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes, onions and garlic.  Added minced garlic (from the jar), oregano, italian seasoning and salt to taste.  Also, I added italian sausage to the hamburger.

It came out delicious, but a bit overcooked at 8-hours in the crock pot.  Next time I will adjust to 6-hours.

I hated this lasagne.  It was VERY salty and I saw no benefit to cooking it in the slow cooker.  No time was saved.  It's faster to cook lasagne in the oven and the taste was lacking.  I'll stick with my tried and true lasagne recipe from Bon Appetit!

I cheated and cooked it for three hours on high and one hour on low heat.  It turned out fantastic!  My 2 year old gobbled this up!  I will definently be making this again and again.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!  Be careful, it will boil out the top if your crock isn't big enough.

I was very disappointed. It was very dry and lacked a lot of taste. I love slow cooker recipes but this one is not a keeper!

I took a lot of liberties with the given recipe. First and foremost, I made it gluten free--and it was GOOD! Based on intuition, taste, and previous reviews, here's what I did: I used 1 lb of ground pork instead of beef, sweet onion, about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic. I used about 1-1/2 jars of meat-flavored Ragu (would not have been my choice, but my daughter works in a grocery store and sometimes her choices prevail). I omitted the salt but added about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons of dried basil, about 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary and a few shakes of powdered thyme and about half a cup of white sugar to the tomatoa sauce. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, 1 cup shredded parmesan mixed with the ricotta (plus more on top), and two slightly beaten eggs to lighten the ricotta. I used a whole 10-oz box Tinkyada lasagna noodles and a whole 26-oz jar of hot tap water poured overall. I sprayed my 6-qt slow cooker with olive oil spray, layered starting with the tomato sauce on the bottom, and added about 24 oz. shredded cheese on top about 4 hours in. It was perfectly done in about 5 hours. It's really good the next day (and the day after) reheated in the microwave. My daughter, who needs the gluten-free diet because of celiac disease, didn't like it (decided she doesn't like ricotta), but my GF neighbor raved and I love it. Gluten-free, short-cut, show-cooker? To me, it's just shy of miraculous.

I made this last night. I really believe you should make recipe before rating it!
I did and was very impressed with the result. I spent the same amount of time and love assembling this as I would have a baked one. The only difference was I was able to allow it to cook and serve for my family and run a kid back to college round trip, and not worry bing home in time to retrieve it from the oven. Now that's made out of love PrettyMissusR! I did read a good number a reviews before making this. One reviewer suggested adding more sauce. I did add an extra 15 oz. of sauce and did used Rocotta because I prefer it and i generally like more sauce on and in a dish. It may have been fine as written, thought I'd take tips from others that actually took the time to try this. Mine did cook the entire 7 hours, plus stayed on the warm setting for about another 15 minutes. It was great! Did not dry out or become mushy. It was as good or better than when baked. It also let it cool in he crock pot while making and serving a salad and pouring a nice glass of wine. Mine also served up pretty and it stayed together as a result of of letting sit a little time to set up. Would most defiantly this make again and may never bake one again.  Thank you for the recipe and most of all idea of trying lasagna in the crock pot KIMIRN!

5 STARS for CONCEPT!!!Not sure why I had not thought of this myself!!!  Great way to make ahead for a busy day and have a great meal! I read this recipe and wanted to try it, thinking i had all the ingredients, so planned on it.  Then found the lasagna noodles I had were No Boil.  Wasn't sure how it would work.  Used them anyway.  I have a HUGE crockpot and there is just 2 of us, so I often make smaller versions of recipes in Pyrex or stoneware casseroles that fit inside my crockpot.  This was the case again, so made a smaller version in a smaller casserole and placed inside of crockpot.  worrying about the no boil noodles, i poured some water in the crockpot until it was about halfway up the casserole dish, a baine marie so to speak, and set it for 4 hours. PERFECT!!!!  I used homemade marinara, and had some turkey italian sausage that needed to be used up. Added a can of mushrooms. YUM!!  Will try again because I LOVE using my crockpot!!!

I was feeling extra lazy today so I figured I would give this a try. It came out GREAT! I browned the hamburger w/onion, garlic, etc. Then I added two, 24 oz jars of spaghetti sauce. I put a generous amount on the bottom and layered as directed. I ended up with 3 layers in a 5 qt slow cooker. Massive lasagna!! Very easy, super good!

Wonderful!!  My best suggestion I have is to use wide egg noodles instead of lasagna noodles...much easier and same results! I used jarred sauce, and mixed it down with water to prevent drying out. I also added spinach to the cheese mixture..yum! 6 hours on 'low' in my crock pot was plenty of time. Great recipe...a keeper!!

I made this yesterday! It turned out excellent! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and added 1 cup of water around the edges. 4 hours later, it was a cheesy creamy lasagna. Way better than the oven version. My husband loved it. It's a keeper!

I followed this recipe as written with two modifications due to personal preference.  I used ricotta mixed with one egg and italian seasoning in place of the cottage cheese and oregano.  I used my 5 quart slow cooker and this lasagna turned out amazing.  I did not add any extra liquid and had no problem with dryness or it being overcooked.  My two children 7 and 11 both loved it and told me it was the best lasagna they have ever had!  This will be my go to reciped from now on!  Thank you KIMIRN for such a fantastic recipe!!

After reading this recipe the first thing that came to my mind is "dry". So I added a bottle of beer as I layered the items in to the crock pot, I might have drank one myself. I have always said a dry cook is a sorry cook. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter jus added aboy 45 minutes to the cooking time. As someone said all crock pots are not created equal, mine is slow. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe with a few alterations.  I sauteed 1 medium onion with extra lean ground beef in 1 tbsp of olive oil, seasoned well with salt (I didn't add the 1 1/2 teaspooons of salt), pepper, dried italian herb mix, added garlic at the end for about 30 seconds, added two jars of Classico spaghetti sauce (tomato & basil).  Added an egg to the cheese mixture. Added 2 cups of shredded italian cheese blend to top for last 30 mins of cook time.  I cooked this on high for 1 hour, then put on low.  Total cook time for me was 3.5 hours.  It came out PERFECT!!!!  I will definitely be making this again.  This was not dry at all and was not salty, again I didn't add that much salt, just a little to the beef.

I am always skeptical of slow cooker recipes which involve pasta or rice but this turned out fantastic! After reading several reviews, i decided to try this using ground turkey and only added a tiny bit of sea salt (many complained that this dish was much too salty) to the meat while I was browning it only because ground turkey tends to be a bit bland. I also added a bit of dried basil to the meat sauce mixture. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and left it in the slow cooker for 4 hours exactly. My husband and kids loved it! I would definately recommend this recipe to those who like lasagne.

Reduced salt to 1 t. Added 1 c. water. Used 16 oz. cottage cheese (i.e. the whole container. Used 6 oz. lasagna noodles (regular kind). Cooked for 1 Hr on High and 1 Hr 45 min on Low. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly (ha!). It was perfect. I think the important thing is to - as others have suggested - make sure the noodles are immersed in the meat sauce. They will cook up fine! I have a big oval Crock Pot.

This was a very tasty and simple to make recipe.  I really appreciated that I didn't have to pre-cook the lasagna noodles.  It was super fast to throw together and came out reasonably well.  This will definitely be a repeat.
Edited:  6 hours is TOO LONG for this recipe.  Both times I have made it, the edges get burnt and gross.  This last time, somehow after 6 hours it became entirely inedible :(  Stick to 4 hours.

I made this for dinner today.  I used egg noodles instead of lasagna noodles, as someone previously mentioned.  This was really good.  Even my teenage son commented on how much he liked it.

I'm pretty picky about lasagna and was so pleased about how this came out. I'll try one of the variations suggested next time as well.

I made this for my husband and kids and it was a hit. My 19 & 14 year olds - who don't like lasagna - even went back for seconds and my 2 year old ate everything on her plate. It's even better the second day!

Everyone loved this lasagna.  I actually prepared it the night before, put it in the fridge and then slow cooked it the next morning.  I think it helped soften the uncooked pasta.  Next time I hope to save some cooked in the freezer and see how well it freezes.

This is a good base recipe.  I did change a few things.  I actually used my regular lasagna recipe.  Only difference is I cooked it in the crock pot.  Since I used my recipe I didn't experience any dryness and my noodles were all done.  I omitted the tomato sauce and paste.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice and a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I also use italian seasoning which has oregano in it.  After browning my meat and onion mixture I add the tomatoes, spaghetti sauce, and seasonings and cook through.  I get plenty of liquid from the can of diced tomatoes.  I also use ricotta cheese and mix an egg in it.  We love a lot of cheese in this so its about 2 bags of mozzarella in the middle and on the top before cooking.  Cooked on low for 3 hours and it was done.  You can probably cook it for longer if you like, but after 3-4 hours check on it. Definitely a crowd pleaser.  I gave it 4 because it is similar to mine, but I still have to change it because of other reviews.

Great meal!  Both my husband and daughter (21 mos) loved it.  I did as others suggested and added an onion.  I will definitely make this again for dinner.

Haven't made this yet, but after looking at reviews from people, one thing is whenever I have made oven lasagna, I NEVER boil the noodles, I just add 1/2 c. water to spaghetti sauce and the noodles will cook fine.  Also, I add sausage to the hamb, and use ricotta, parmesan and mozz. cheeses with an egg stirred in.  Always turns out good.  I am looking forward to making this.  I will let you know:-)

Are you worried about pasta in the slow cooker?  First thing take out a cookie sheet [That's what I use]  Pour in hot water & lay your pasta in it to give it a head start.  I also do this when I make my lasagna in the oven

This is a wonderful recipe - it makes lasagna easy - but, I make one change to this, because I can't stand that floury taste that permeates the dish from uncooked lasagna - and I am probably a minority in that, I pre cook the lasagna noodles to al-dente. It shortens the time in the slow cooker to do it this way - otherwise, I change nothing :) and its delish!

I found this recipe MANY years ago and it has turned out to be one of my family's favorites.  However, my recipe does call for 1/2 cup water added to the sauce/paste mixture and the cooking time states cooking on LOW for 4 1/2 - 5 hours only.   Mine has turned out perfect everytime I've made it, never tough or burnt, tastes just like the lasagna served in resturants.

This was outstanding and we will definitely be making this again.  Like some of the other reviewers, I added onion and garlic to the ground beef and also added italian seasoning.  I used canned tomatoes and blended it in a blender.  Added the tomatoes, tomato paste and about 1 cup of store bought sauce I had leftover in fridge.  I used a 2 1/2 qt slow cooker and ended up using all of the sauce and filling but only 1/2 the box of noodles.  I only used 1/2 the mozzarella cheese in the filling (and threw in some more italian seasoning for flavor) and when I did the layering, I sprinkled additional mozzarella cheese on top of the cheese mixture.  I used an entire 16oz container of cottage cheese because I don't use it for anything else so I didn't want leftovers and I did add 2 eggs as others suggested.  Cooked on hihg for 2 1/2 hours and then lowered for 1 1/2 hours more.  It was PERFECT!  Noodles were not mushy (not even the leftovers the next day!) and it filled the crockpot to the rim.  Next time, I think I will use the 6 qt crock pot I have and double the filling and meat.  The meat sauce was a littel runny as I spooned it on to the cheese but I think that helped the noodles and was the reason I didn't have to add extra water.  Delicious!!!  Thanks so much!

Used a jar of spaghetti sauce, small can of tomato sauce and 1/2 can tomato paste for sauce.  I was afraid the noodles wouldn't bake, so I didn't use all of them in the package.  Next time will use more. It turned out great.  Baked on high for 2 1/2 hours then turned to low for another 1 1/2.  Next time will add egg with the cheese mixture.

This is just so delicious, I make it every chance I get.  I think the only catch, as other reviewers have mentioned, is that every crockpot is different.  Mine is pretty big, oval-shaped.  I cooked this on Low for 4 hours and it came out perfect, just getting crispy on the edges.  I used some of the meat mixture for the top layer, otherwise that layer of noodles wouldn't have been moist.  All of the noodles came out perfectly - no mushiness or chewiness.  Sometimes I make my own sauce from scratch first and other times I just use jars of good-quality sauce, and it still comes out fantastic.  I always add a couple extra garlic cloves and more basil.  And I replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta - it makes it more difficult to stir the cheese mixture, but I bet that would have been easier if I had let the cheese sit at room temperature for a bit.  I have also made it with the cottage cheese and it's a tad blander that way, but still good.  Maybe next time I will use both Ricotta and cottage cheese to see what happens.  I also didn't add any salt - if I had, it would have been too salty. The cheese and pasta already have plenty.  This is just a fun, yummy crockpot recipe that tastes even better the next day and leaves room for experimentation, if desired.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Made it at work for a crock pot luncheon.  Nothing was left.  Everyone complimented me on the lasagna.  I followed the recipe, all I added was more chesese on the top at the end.  I will use this lasagna again.  Easy to prepare.

This tasted fine but is just as much work as making lasagna the traditional way. The only advantage might be in letting it cook for a longer period. Messy in appearance so if you like the "perfect" looking piece of lasagna, this is not it. Good flavor though.

After reading reviews, and realizing I was short on some ingredients I slightly modified this recipe.  I used a mix of spaghetti sauce, tomato sauce, and tomato juice to reach 29 oz after I realized I was short of tomato sauce.  I also added an egg to the cheese mixture and used a little bit more cottage cheese (to just finish up the container).  Used farfalle pasta in place of lasagna noodles b/c I didn't feel like fitting rectangle pasta in a round bowl.  I have to admit I was skeptical and thought we might be eating crunchy or mushy noodles.  But everything was cooked perfectly!  Delicious!!

This recipe turned out great for me. It took 4 hrs. in my oblong slow cooker. I added a can of crushed tomatoes to the sauce to make sure there was enough to cover the noodles. My family really liked this too.

This recipe was absolute Delicious!!  I did use more sauce and I actually used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I did also substitute the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese.  I used more ricotta cheese in the recipe too.  Made it for a lot of people.....they loved it!!!  It was dry....very very good.  I also sprayed my crockpot with Pam.  VERY VERY GOOD!!  I will definitely make this again.

Overall, good recipe where you can be liberal and creative with ingredients and still have a good dish.  I doubled the meat & sauce and added more “Italian spices” than it called for.  I doubled the amount of mozzarella and added eggs and parsley to ricotta (not cottage) cheese, too.  Also note that when you are layering the noodles, you need to make sure they are well submersed in the meat sauce and then they cook up just fine (not mushy and not hard).  It was tasty; good for camping or a pot-luck when you wouldn’t expect lasagna.  This recipe doesn’t save any time though– it just makes lasagna more “mobile”.  Also, it doesn’t look as pretty as a pan baked lasagna when serving.  Oh, and use a crock-pot liner for this one and make cleanup a snap!

This was not the prettiest looking lasagna I've ever made, but it did taste good. I like this recipe because I can omit the step of cooking the noodles first.

This is a very good recipe overall.  I thought it came out a bit too salty and would suggest cutting the salt back to 1/2 teaspoon.  Also, try adding a bit of sweet basil.  I also added a bit more minced garlic.  My slow cooker cooked this in about 2 1/2 hrs on low so one needs to monitor the cooking time.  Overall, very good.  I will make it again and serve it to others.

This did not turn out well at all. I followed other reviewers advice and added water to the meat sauce to make sure the noodles cooked. I only cooked it for 4 hours and the noodles were mushy. My boyfriend will usually eat anything I make, even if it doesn't turn out well. He would not eat this.

This recipe is definitely worth experimentation and tweaking.  I loved the ease of preparation and not making my kitchen hot on a sultry summer's day.  Mine was a vegetarian spinach version with several substitutions.  However, the method of cooking works very well.  My noodles were a bit mushy also and next time I will reduce the time to 4 hours.  Also, I have a theory that a few of the problems reported with burning and sticking on the bottom may be a result of the type of crockpot used rather than the recipe.  If the heating coils are only on the bottom of the cooker rather than surrounding the sides as well, it makes sense that there might be some burning or sticking as a result. I will definitely use this recipe and technique in the future!

A very good recipe.  It makes enough to freeze half of it for another meal.  I used jarred sauce (Classico spicy red pepper) instead of making it from scratch, and also used no-cook lasagna noodles (Barilla).  I cut the time down to six hours.  Otherwise, it would have been quite burnt. It was a little burnt on the edges as it was, but my family likes lasagna that way!

We don't care for cottage cheese so I subbed non-fat ricotta and I also used my own sauce. After reading reviews and seeing quite a few of them said it burnt I decided to let it cook for only 6 hours. This is the FIRST time my crockpot has burnt anything! Just the bottom turned slightly black. Will adjust the cooking time next time to no more than 5 hours. A lot of times we have a really busy schedule and cooking a traditional meal is sometimes hard. Slow cooking is a big help for us. Will make this again but with a few changes.

Perfect! I used canned spaghetti sauce instead of creating my own, and cooked it two hours on high, and two on low. I also used one of those new slow cooker bags to make clean-up easy.. and it's the perfect dinner! My 4 year old and my husband both loved it, so we'll definitely be adding it to our list of usuals.

Kim, this was great!!  We had it put together and cooking in the crockpot when a good friend of ours called and invited us out to dinner.  We hadn't seen her in almost 5 years, so we took her up on her offer.  We put the crockpot in the fridge and out the door we went.  The next day when dinner time rolled around, we cut out what we wanted, heated it up and boy oh boy was it delicious!!!  A definate keeper!!  My husband was concerned it would not be good if we didn't eat it right away, but I have a feeling it was probably better for setting up over night.  Go ahead and give this one a try...I think you will really enjoy it!

I don't like cottage cheese or even Ricotta so I replaced it with more cheese. The other advice a person left about spraying the slow cooker with Pam is a good idea.No need to add water to the recipe I just added a small can of diced tomatoes with all the juices. I added the Italian spices to the recipe as others suggested plus some chili peppers as I like a bit of hot spiciness. Oh ! plus I used the oven-ready lasagna noodle someone else recommended also. I have a 6qt slow cooker and it took 4.5 hours with the top layer being sauce, then put the final layer of pepperoni, then more cheese and cooked for another 1/2 hr. No crusty or soggy noodles here and was delicious ! Update ! I found out that it is 100% ok to broil your slow cooker "shell" in the oven, so I do it all the time now and add pepperoni and cheese and brown to perfection. It really finishes it off nice ! P.S. I wouldn't use a slow cooker liner in this case just use ample oil spray on the bottom and sides or it could get quite cumbersome and hard to divide pieces...

My husband and I love this recipe. I am a terrible cook so I like recipes that are easy. My husband is Italian and he loves this recipe so I am confident that it is a good recipe at least it is for my house. I made some changes but it was a personal preference. I add ricotta cheese as well as the cottage cheese. And I add a little more spices for flavor (powdered garlic and onion, oregano, sea salt and basil. I also add diced tomatoes and a half cup of red wine to the sauce (my husband's recommendation) in addition to the tomato sauce and it gives it a nice flavor and turns out wonderful. I cook it for 6 hours and when the timer is up the lasagna is done and it tastes yummy. I do not have a problem with the lack of water; however, I add the diced tomatoes and wine so they provide extra liquid. I am sad to see others do not care for this recipe- I love it. I like cooking it in the slow cooker because it doesn't heat up the entire house like the oven does. Thank you very much for sharing this treasure with us!

I am curious to know from all that have cooked this dish. Question is " what if we/ I use fresh noodles
would it cut the cooking time in half.?
also I noted on one of the reviews that it was too saltie. There is salt already in the sauces,noodles so don't add any salt while cooking add at the end at the table Let me know what you think.

My family loved this, but I did add a few things. When I brown the meat I ad added a TBSP of Basil and a tsp of oregano. I then added double that to the sauce, plus salt. I let it simmer while I mixed the cheeses. My crockpot cooked it in about 2 to 3 hours on low.

This is a keeper recipe for sure!  I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese, and I added a cup of water to the meat sauce as someone else suggested in a previous review.  I cooked it for 5 hours on low and it came out perfectly done and absolutely delicious.  You must add this recipe to your collection.

I thought this dish tasted REALLY good, and I liked that I had much less dishes to do than the old way. My husband LOVED it!! I hardly got any leftovers. I did however use some bottled sauce instead of making it. The main thing was that my top layer of noodles (they had cheese mixture over them but no sauce) were not soft. So I suggest when assembling your last layer, put the sauce LAST over the noodles, even if it's out of order to make sure all the noodles are soft!

I was so surprised at how good this lasagna turned out. I followed everyone's advice and used ricotta with a lightly beaten egg. I also added basil and oregano to the cheese mixture. I used 2 jars of my favorite sauce and sausage. I layered the sausage on the bottom, covered with 1 layer of lasagna noodles(not doubled) then all the cheese mixture, some more noodles, making sure to completely cover noodles with sauce.  Cooked for 2 and 1/2 hours on high and it was delicious!! Thanks for the recipe, My husband wants me to try it with vegetable next time!

I'm giving this recipe 5 Stars because I have always been intimidated to make lasagna for some reason.  This is really a fool proof recipe.  It's very forgiving and delicious.  I followed the instructions of a previous reviewer who suggested adding equal parts of water to your sauce.  If you don't do this it will burn for sure.  I put the lasagna together the day before and put it in the crockpot the following day.  My lasagna only took about 4 hours on high. You can really custom make this to your own preference.  Adding various vegetables or different types of meats such as ground turkey, sausage, etc.  This recipe made a ton for me.  My crockpot is very big and I have enough leftovers for 6-8 people !  Thanks for sharing

This was a great recipe.  As all slow cookers are different, it's important to keep an eye on this the first time you make it.  Make sure that your meat sauce is runnier (almost twice as runny) than you would normally make for a conventional lasagne and you won't go wrong.

I have used this recipe a lot over the past couple years, and it's really good.  Instead of cottage cheese, I use ricotta, and sometimes I substitute ground turkey for ground beef.  I also use jarred sauce instead of tomato paste and sauce.  This is a really great recipe to throw together before I go to work, and especially during the summer when I don't feel like slaving over a hot stove!

This is a great easy recipe with a few alterations.  I do find it easier than traditional lasagna because you don't have to pre-cook the noodles.  Here are the alterations I made:  I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, a 15 oz container of low-fat ricotta cheese, 2 - 15oz cans of tomato sause, 1 - 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, 1-6oz can of tomato paste and I put a lot of extra italian seasoning in for extra taste.  I also seasoned the hamburger with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I think it would be bland otherwise.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then 1.5 hours on low and it turned out perfect.  Really a great recipe!  Thanks Kim!

I did a lot of substituting on this recipe.  I added italian sausage along with the ground beef.  I omitted the onion, garlic, sauce, paste, salt and oregano and used bottled sauce (would have made my own sauce, but ran out of time).  I also used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese.  In the ricotta cheese I added two eggs, salt, pepper and parsley and mixed it well.  I also used penne pasta instead of the lasagna noodles.  I cooked it on high for one hour and low for 2 hours.  It turned out fabulously!  I would rather make this lasanga than the traditional oven method!

Yummy! This recipie turned out very well. The noodles came out perfect. I did make a few adjustmens. I used 1, 26 oz can of Tomato Basil premade sauce (instead of plain tomato sauce) & added a 6 oz can of tomato sauce & mixed in a 1/3 cup sour cream with the cheeses( thanks to another review on the site)IT even taste good the next day. Will make again.

I wanted a home cooked hearty meal, but was going to be out all afternoon.  I have heard of doing lasagna this way so I searched for this recipe.  This recipe is very good and classic in that you make this almost the same as an oven lasagna.  There is a lot of prep work, as with an oven lasagna, luckily I had all morning to get this going in the crock pot.  If you have the time to get this started then you won't be disappointed.  If you are looking for "toss-in-crock-pot-and-go" simplicity then this is not the recipe for you.  Personally, I prefer oven lasagna because of the melted mozza on top, and the baked-goodness of it all.  I will make this recipe again if I find myself with a lot of time to prepare, but no time to hang around and cook later.

After reading other reviews I decided to really doctor this recipe up and I got pretty good results.  I use a Robusto Ragu sauce instead of making my own, but I did add some extra italian seasoning and garlic to it.  Also, when ever I use cottage cheese in a lasagna I add a 1/3 cup sour cream, an egg, and some pepper.  This makes it creamier.  I used the no-boil noodles.  I cooked it one hour on high and one and one half hours on low and added cheese on top the last one half hour.  Pretty good recipe.  Oven lasagna has a more complex flavor and stays in layers, and in the crock pot it tends to be more goopy but still good.  Will use this recipe as a basis again.

Fairly easy to throw together and it turned out pretty much how I expected.  Good but not a recipe that I would make for company.

Smelled delicious while cooking.  Found that the double layer on noodles made it almost pasty.  Would be better with traditional single layers. A little more sauce would have been nice.  Be careful...this recipe expands as the noodles cook!  A larger crockpot is recommended.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE, HOWEVER, IT DIDN'T TAKE AS LONG FOR MINE TO BE DONE.  IT WAS DONE WITHIN 3 1/2 TO 4 HOURS (ON LOW SETTING).  IF I HAD LET IT SLOW COOK ALL DAY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY TOO OVERCOOKED.

Made this for a girl's cabin weekend and it was so easy and well received by everyone!  Followed the recipe as is and since we like extra sauce, I poured a 29 oz jar of sauce on top once everything was in the crock pot. Don't think I'll be making a pan of lasagna again!!

The sauce was excellent, and it permeated through the house, and everyone was saying, "It smells so good."  The taste was delicious, but the downside was that it came out a bit dry and overcooked.  4 hours on low in the crockpot was clearly too long.  I will have to adjust my cooking time next time.  I don't think it's any less time consuming than regular lasagna, with the exception of not having to cook the noodles, but it sure was nice to not have my kitchen heat up from the oven during the summer in Phoenix, AZ.

This was a great recipe that was easy to make.  I just made a couple of modifications by adding seasoning to the meat such as garlic powder, salt, pepper and italian seasoning. I also used the Basil and Cheese Ragu Spaghetti sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce.  It was great and my family loved it!

I give this recipe 4 stars as is, although I bet it will be a 5-star recipe with a few changes.  I made the recipe as-is with the following exceptions: 1 lb ground chicken for 1 lb ground beef 12 oz shredded mozz for 16 oz shredded mozz 12 oz FAT FREE cottage for 12 oz cottage ADDED 29 oz of water to meat mixture  My husband LOVED this lasagna.  I thought it was good as well, although I found it a tad too salty as-is.  So, next time I would delete adding any salt.  For what it's worth, I also think that 8 oz of shredded mozzarella would be plenty, particularly if you're looking to make it a bit healthier.  The water definitely helped, as my lasagna turned out very moist and delicious.  I would likely cook it for 5 or 5 1/2 hours next time, as it burned slightly on the edges this time.  The burning didn't affect the taste, however.  If you choose to add water, make sure you're using a large skillet during prep and a large Crock during cooking.  Mine is a large Smart Pot, so I didn't have any issues with capacity or bubbling over.  Finally, the recipe produced lots of lasagna.  My husband and I each had a portion for dinner, and we still had enough for generous leftover portions for several meals thereafter.  So, I think the 10 servings estimate is definitely accurate.  My husband called this lasagna "absolutely delicious," so I'll definitely be making it again.  It's a good, easy recipe to have in the file!

This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, ricotta for the cottage cheese and added more sauce. I cooked it for 5 hours on low, and the noodles were perfect. My brother who really doesn't even like pasta went back for seconds and thirds. Perfect!

I made this for a pot luck and it was great. Everyone wanted the recipie. The only thing I changed was I added layers of thinley sliced zuccini and mushrooms. also I did not add any salt and I followed the advice of others and added a slightly beaten egg to the cheese mixture.

I'm glad I had a backup jar of sauce & 1lb of meat because there was no way this was going to fill the crockpot without it!  I had a whole cup of cheese to go when I ran out of sauce!  I subbed ricotta for cottage cheese.  I also made sure to add a little water per the suggestions.  I wanted it ready in 4 hours so cooked it on high for an hour, then low for 3hrs and it came out perfect - no mushy, no burn. Definitely could use some more garlic & spices so I'll try that next time.  ps- leave out the salt!!!

Well, I had high hopes but this didn't fit the bill for us. It was dry, had an odd texture, burned on the edges but pasta was not done in the middle, and just an ok taste. I really wanted it to turn out better, although I have to say I'm glad I at least tried it.

This recipe was okay, but make sure you put the sauce as the final layer or the top layer of noodles will be quite crunchy!

this was better than any oven-baked lasagna i have tasted. everything stayed so moist. a few adjustments (hey, everyone's doing it) No Salt! Extra Sauce! Whip 1 or 2 eggs into the cheese blend to make it easier to spread. And make sure every noodle is covered with sauce, or it will dry out. Will definitely make again! Maybe sausage?

The pasta is really mushy. Much better to cook lasagna the old fashioned way.
It also needs some seasonings. A shake of Italian season (about a tsp. and a half or more to your taste) or some oregano, basil, rosemary. Something to perk it up. Pasta should be cooked "to the teeth or bite." Not raw, of course, but definitely not mushy.

It's already been said, but this is a wonderful time-saver with plenty of room for adapting/changing for taste or time.  I also used (nonfat)ricotta, my own sauce, and chopped spinach, carrots, and zucchini in the cheese mixture.  Great for a hot night when you don't want to turn on the oven. Mmmm!

Okay... we're not picky people and are very forgiving of mediocre food but, this recipe was NOT good. Added extra tomato sauce like most of the other reviews suggest, and cooked it just about 5 hours.  Noodles turned out like mush but more with the texture of glue.  Should have just made the real thing- wouldn't have taken as long and would've tasted much better. Will not make again.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, an italian cheese mix instead of two cheese called for, and ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I did not mix the ricotta and italian cheese but layered the italian on top of the ricotta.
After slightly less than 8 hours on low the edges were black as was most of the top layer.  Below the bottom layer, it was not burned, but it was so overcooked it was tasteless and  the cheeses had bonded together into a tastless spongelike substance.  Will not try this again.

This was EXCELLENT! I did read the reviews first and made some adjustments. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I layered the meat sauce throughout, but then topped this with a jar of spaghetti sauce so it wouldn't dry out. It was done in 5 hours on low. Everyone really liked it too! Thanks!

The method of cooking is great, but the recipe itself wasn't all that great.  But if you use the recipe you would use in an oven, it would be better.  6-8 hours is way too long.  I think mine finished in like 3 hours.  And it was dry, so do add water!

This was pretty good but I wish I would have read the reviews first.  I also agree that 6-8 hours is too long.  The noodles came out mushy by cooking that long.  I will make this again but will only cook 4 hours as others have suggested.  I also think I will add some sliced mushrooms next time.  Make sure the meat mixture is the the top layer (this will keep the top layer of noodles from drying out).

This was the first recipe I tried in my slow cooker and I followed the recipe exactly, and it was burnt on the bottom.  However, the rest of it was SO GOOD that I just had to make it again and I found that 5 hours to cook is just fine.  It did seem a tad dry so I added 1/3 cup water and it was perfect!

I read all the reviews before I first made this recipe almost 3 years ago. I now make two crockpots at same time. Spray well inside crockpot with non-stick spray, follow the layering exactly, ending with cheese mixture on top. For variety,I add 15oz sliced mushrooms drained, to meat mixture sometimes. Four hours on low, and I've always had perfect lasagna, with everone wanting the recipe. This is good cold for mid-night snackers, or warmed up in microwave. Also freezes well.

I made this for dinner recently. I've been  using my oven for other baking (pumpkin seeds this week), so I'm trying to use my slow cooker for dinners. I skipped the sauce and just used a couple jars of spaghetti sauce. I had a box of broken lasagna noodles which worked out perfectly. I left this cooking for my husband to serve while I went to school. He reported back that it tasted really good, and both kids ate it well. I had the leftovers the next day for lunch, but I had to pour some extra sauce over it. It was still pretty good. I'll stick with my "World's best lasagna" (on this site) for most cooking, but I like this for days when I don't want to have to take extra time and watch the oven.

I was a bit skeptical about this one, but I thought what the heck.  I have one of those 1970's olive green crockpots and it was still great.  Can't wait to get one of the more current models and try again, it will probably layer better.

We LOVED this recipe!! I rarely make lasagne, but this was so easy to prepare.  Even my picky daughter liked it.  And easy? Well, let me just say, my husband made it for dinner last night!  Definitely a keeper!

The meat has to be prepared in advance, just like in any lasagna recipe, so this may slow down someone in a huge hurry.  However, not having to cook the noodles makes for a major speedup!!  I made about 6 batches of the meat portion in advance, so now when I make it, I just pull a baggie out of the freezer at night, and in the morning layer everything in the pot, and by the time I get home it is ready and waiting.  My daughter LOVES this recipe, as does my husband and I.  I am so glad I found this recipe, and have given it to family and friends to try.

Between soccer, ballet and everything else, this recipe was a lifesaver.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  It was so easy to put together. I used a large jar of spagettie sauce instead and it was wonderful.

My sister was coming over for dinner one night and she's a vegetarian. I had printed this recipe and was going to use ground turkey, but decided to make my lasagna with veggies instead.  I didn't have time to do the tomato sauce and garlic thing, so I opened a jar of spaghetti sauce and layered frozen vegetables.  I improvised, let it cook for 6 hours and it smelled and tasted great!! I would recommend this dish for anyone who loves lasagna!!!  Diane

My family really enjoyed it....It was great not having to cook the noodles first, but as far as quick, you still had to brown the meat, onions, garlic, etc. and add the sauce but the PLUS was you could put it in the slow cooker and forget about it until you got home from work...to save time I prepared it the night before and stored it in the crockpot in the refrigerator until morning then plugged it in before I left for work......

I prepped it the night before so I could just turn on the crockpot first thing in the morning for my potluck luncheon. As one reviewer suggested, because the noodles were able to soften overnight , I cut the cooking time in half. I did 1 hour on high, and 2.5-3 hours on low. By noon, the lasagna was done and delicious and I left it on the keep warm function. I also did some modifications: jar of Classico spaghetti sauce, 1 can of tomato paste, replaced cottage cheese with ricotta and added some red pepper flakes. I topped the lasagna off with cheese the last hour of cooking. Noodles came out perfect and the sides weren't burnt.  Thank you for this easy recipe!

OK, I am going to be the person that makes all of the adds/changes and then rates the recipe 5 stars.  First, I used ground turkey and on 28 oz jar of Newman's sauce and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce b/c we like a lot of sauce, I also used a 15 oz tub of low fat ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added a bit of milk to the cheese mix to make it easier to spread. Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  B/C I have a new crock pot, I did 2 1/2 hours on high, topped with a bit of extra mozzarella and finished for 1/2 hour on low.  As good a baked lasagna.  Thanks so much for posting.

If you make this same recipe in your favorie lasagna pan and add water until almost pan is briming cover tightly with plastic wrap, then cover tightly with foil and place in fridge for several hours or until you are ready to use it. Now just heat and eat. Do not over bake. And if you made it in a ceramic or glass pan use the microwave instead. This is the only way I have made my trays of lasagna since 1979, and I am a professional chef.

I loved the end result of this recipe.  Before beginning, I read a lot of the reviews and made a few substitutions.  To make sure the dish did not dry out, at another reviewer's suggestion, I added probably 3/4 cup of water, a little over the noodles, and over the meat mixture, wherever I felt it was too thick. I used regular, not pre-cooked noodles.  I also added a full large container of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, and a 32 oz. container of 4-cheese spaghetti sauce, no tomato sauce, but all other ingredients as in original recipe.  This was the best lasagna I've ever made and I'll definitely make it again.  It was creamy, the noodles weren't gummy, and the sauce was great.  I think other additions could be made, such as mushrooms, green peppers, perhaps shellfish.  I think the first time you make this, you should stay close to home so you know how fast it's going to cook.  I was expecting mine to take 4 to 6 hours, but it was done in 3, with a couple of dark brown spots in 2 places.  My slow cooker is older and its 'low' setting is probably slower than newer models.

Make sure sauce is last layer on top to keep the noodles moist. I just had cheese on top of the last layer of noodles and they end up hard.

WHAT a FANTASTIC WAY TO Prepare Lasagna!!I so much appreciate being able to come home to a wonderful dish that I don't have to babysit while cooking in the oven....I have a VERY Busy and ACTIVE life...always on the go working long hours and this type of recipe is perfect for busy people. When I become older I may be able to babysit with the oven method ...but NOT FOR NOW!!

Mine got a bit burnt in the crock pot, but I didn't mind. Kids opted to eat the softer part and not the burnt edges.  Flavor was good and was pretty easy to put together.  I will shorten my cooking time to the 4 hours instead of the 6 hours next time.

I tried this recipe last night and it was excellent! I thought it would be a bit mushy (since cooked in a slow cooker) but the consistency was just like when it's cooked in the oven.  It cooked about 4 hours at low and was a hit.  Have it with garlic break and salad. It makes a beautifully colored plate.

A little dry, needed more cottage cheese we think.  Got a little overcooked around the edges, though I blame that on my ginormous Crockpot as much as anything.  It seems to get extra hot for some reason.

I gave this 5 stars because i changed it a bit. I used two 16oz cans if target brand garlic/basil sauce. Hot sausage,1 onion, fresh mushrooms,a table spoon on parsely and oregano for meat sauce. I put a layer of zucchini over meatsauce.I used ricotta, 16oz of mozzerella, a couple hand fulls of spinich, 1/2 cup parmersan, and 2 eggs for cheese spread. I double layered the 12 oz oven ready lasagna. The breaking part got annoying after awhile. I layer it meat, zucchini,pasta,cheese ect...The final layer was sauce i added about a half cup of water in the sauce containers to use all the sauce so 1 cup total and poured it over. I have a 5 quart pot and it almost filled it up. I cooked a little over 2 hours on high and 1 on low. No burned edges or bottom. I had to check alot though. I would push the edges in so some of the liquid would flow down the sides.I ended up adding 1/4 cup more water. The last 1/2 hour i put chedder jack on top(all i had left) SOOO AMAZING! I wish the pasta was more firm, but it wasnt super mushy. I use sausage becauase its not as noticable as ground hamber or turkey. I prefer just veggies but husband wanted meat. First time making in a slow cooker so i was panicking the whole time but it turned out great. Everyone who tried it loved it too and wanted the recipe. The key is to watch it! I would't leave it alone so it takes away the convience of a slow cooker, but if it was lazy hot sunday this recipe is perfect!

I used this recipe as a guideline and then customized it for convenience and our preferences.  I used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce to save time and substituted kielbasa for the meat.  I also mixed in a shredded carrot and some spinach to the sauce mixture.  I cooked on low for about 4 hours and it turned out great!  Very easy and made great leftovers for lunches!

Not the recipe for me. I did not change much, but I did add a little extra water. My crockpot has the tendency to burn things without a lot of liquid so I was paranoid that might happen. I ended up with the opposite end of the spectrum. I had a runny mess on my hands. The taste was nothing special and this was a bit time consuming for the morning slow cooker scramble. I think there are better recipes for a slow cooker.

This recipe was very flavorful, though when I followed it to the "t" the meat sauce came out too dry. I did add about 14 oz of water into the sauce, and still a bit dry. So, as nervous as I was, I poured about a 1/4 cup of water over each noodle layer. It turned out to be a little gluey and mushy, so next time, I won't put that much extra water again.

This was really good! The smell when I came home was amazing! I used whole grain lasagna noodles and fat free cottage cheese to make it a little healthier.

In response to Urbanjogurl: It may only take 2 hrs for the oven version. However, I get home at 6:30pm still have to do housework, help with homework etc...preparing a 2 hr meal to eat by 9pm is out of the question. Kudos to you if you have all the time in the world to cook for your family. Something like this is perfect for me and dinner is ready to be served ASAP when I get home! Make it your own by tweaking it a bit. This recipe is awesome!!

We really liked this. I subsituted the cottage for ricotta. The only problem I had was that it was a little greasy.

Bland. Because this lasagne is only as good as the sauce used to make it, I'll try it again with my own homemade sauce.

I thought this recipe was great! Thank You. My husband loved it and so did my parents. I made it and put in fridge for the next days for lunch. It comes out very yummy. I read the reviews and only cooked 4 hours, added more sauce ( Jar of ragu) added some canned green olives and mushrooms. What ever your family like it is very easy to add to this recipe. I did add a container  of ricotta to cheese mixture. I am still going to add a bit more sauce next time. The noodles came out GREAT and good food does take time to fix. Thanks again.

I use this recipe all the time. It was one of the first things we made in my house that was not the typical roast or ham in the slow cooker. I do add some of my own spices thyme and oregano usually. And have always found that the cooking time is about 4 hours.

I really liked this recipe. And so did the 10 other people that I served it to at a church function! I did make modifications as suggested and would likely add more cheese in the future - but I like my lasagna cheesy.

I did like most suggested and used 2 cans of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes with their juice. I also used 16oz instead of 12 of cottage cheese. Will likely use a bit more mozarella last time. I would also agree that 5 - 6 hours on low would likely be enough.

I have made this recipe about 10 times for my husband and I, as well as for others. I have always enjoyed it, and I have always gotten great reviews from it. It only takes about 3 hours in my crock pot.

I read the reviews and allowed five hours for cooking...was not done, had to give it another hour. Be careful on cooktime, just watch it, since so many slow cookers differ. 
The sauce was great, but the noodles were slimey and everybody in my family said they liked my oven lasagna better. I used regular noodles, the no-boil as others used were twice as much money for half as much noodles. Other than no boiling of the noodles it was just as much work as making it in the oven, and the oven lasagna presents much better when served.

I cooked this for my mom and I.  We both really enjoyed it.  I used turkey instead of beef, wheat lasagna noodles, and did not use onions (don't like onions).  I also added fresh mushrooms and green peppers to the sauce.  Very good.

I don't think that I would make it again.  The flavor was good, however, it was real dry.  I used alot more sauce than recommended and it was still dry.  I don't think that it's any easier than making it the conventional way.

Perfect lasagna... I was very skeptical when I was making it.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out perfect.  Nothing burned, nothing was chewy, tasted great.  It took a bit of finagling to get it out and keep it looking pretty but after the first slice was out it was much easier.  5 stars from our entire family, kids and all!

Almost identical to my oven lasagna recipe so I loved the flavor.  Took some extra time for planning and browning the meat so not exactly a "throw it in and leave" recipe.  Also works best in a long oval crock pot.  When I made it in the tall round one, it took longer and made a too thick lasagna that did not come out in clean cuts for picture perfect squares.

This was extremely easy and DEElicious! My slow cooker is a large oval one, the kind with the stainless pot on a base, and it was perfect for this recipe. I cooked 5 hrs. on low, and the next day warmed it up in the same pot on low for an hour or so. The consistency of the noodles and all was just perfect, just like oven lasagna. I'm sure the slow cooker itself may mean the difference in this recipe. I will make this again. Oh, I did add fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce, may try some zuchini next time. THANKS for a terrific recipe!

I made this lasagna exactly as stated and put in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours and it was absolutely horrible. If you cook this like it says for 8 hours, you will have a burnt up pot of black lasagna. the cheese in the middle came out totally brown. I am experienced cooker and this recipe was the biggest waste of money for all the ingredients and then it is way overdone at the time specified

We didn't care for this much.  It was rather dry and REALLY cooked around the edges (bordering burnt) and it only cooked 5 hours on low.  My husband will eat anything and lasagna is his favorite....he didn't finish his plate.   I won't make it again.

As far as easy, you got it! But for some reason it didn't work out to well for my husband and I taste wise. It seemed a little bland in the sauce. Maybe instead of using plain tomato sauce and paste I should have used my favorite spaghetti sauce. That is flavored a little better than the plain sauces. I think I will try it that way next. But it was very easy and the consistency turned out excellent. Great way to cook lasagna Kim!

My entire family enjoyed this recipe.  It seemed to have an over abundant amount of sauce though, therefore I would recommend to layer in more noodles. Great with garlic bread!!

This recipe is awesome.  I used a jar of store bought sauce plus a can of tomato sauce, plus I added some diced carrots and spinach and a few dry seasonings.  I let it cook for six hours and the noodles did come out a LITTLE mushier than I like, so I think I would cut the cook time down a bit, but it was still delicious!  My boyfriend loved it and we will be making it again!!

Substituted Jimmy Dean Italian sausage for ground beef. Substituted whole milk ricotta mixed with beaten egg for cottage cheese (key change). Used no-bake noodles. Added Italian blend of herbs to the cheese mixture. Added 1/2 teaspoon more to the tomato sauce mixture. Add shredded mozzarella to top at last 30 minutes, and left uncovered for last 20 minutes. Total cook time 4 hours 15 minutes. Turned out perfectly. All Clad large slow cooker.

I didn't have oregano or minced garlic or tomato paste so I got the idea to chop garlic and used sage, cumin added red pepper flakes and some marinara. I could tell it was missing the oregano, but still tasted way better than the frozen stuff. Also, I went 3 layers, but single layer of pasta for each layer.

I am married to an Italian so I totally get that there are some dishes that probably shouldn't be made in a crock pot (like lasagna) but I got a call late Sunday night asking me to bring a pot luck dish to a school luncheon on Monday. I did a quick ingredient search and this recipe came up. I put it together Sunday night (with sausage instead of beef, and I layered the mozzarella with the other ingredients).  It only needed about 3 hours to cook on Monday morning and it was a favorite at the luncheon.  I barely got to try any because it was almost gone before I had a chance to try it.  It was really good.  Definitely not a homemade lasagna, but for a quick and easy dish, It was wonderful.  I was repeatedly asked for the recipe.

I make this all the time. My family loves it.  I use 2lbs of hamburger and three cans of Hunts spaghetti sauce. Much easier than mixing all the other ingredients (I know I'm lazy) there is never any left.

I love this recipe. I use a 16 oz package of lasagna noodles, and 16 oz of cottage cheese, two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce instead of the large can, and add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. It turns out perfect.

This was a hit! I have never been a good cook but am slowly getting better and this was my first "complex" meal. I read a bunch of reviews before attempting to make this lasagna and with a few alterations it was near perfect!! The changes I made were as follow: ricotta cheese with a slightly beaten egg instead of cottage cheese, jarred spaghetti sauce for the meat sauce mixture, italian seasoning instead of oregano. I also added one cup of water to the sides of the dish which worked well except one fourth of the cup slowly rose to the top of the dish and I had to keep removing it. Next time I will only use 3/4 cup and that should work very well. Additionally, I cooked it for two hours on hight and one hour on low and it cooked perfectly through. Amazing crock pot lasagna! I will definitely be making this again.

We love this recipe.  I do change it a bit, but overall it is wonderfully easy and very tasty.  I use almost any pasta that we may have, which is almost always macaroni.  If this is used, however, you need to make sure you leave 1-2 inches from the top for expansion.  I also use sausage instead of ground beef, which gives it so much flavor.  I do not use any salt, as the sausage makes up for it.  I always make sure I taste the sauce to see if I need it-never do.  I add mushrooms and any veggies I feel like to add some variety.  I don't think that I have ever made the same way twice.  Love it!!

A keeper in my book. I used the Costco Organic tomato sauce and paste, so not salty! Only a few changes. Try adding (thawed) frozen chopped spinach to the cheese mix, or fresh sauteed mushrooms. 
Also, I used the regular noodles and added extra sauce and water to compensate (no more than 1/2 cup needed).  I only did a single layer of noodles, but broke them into 3 and had some overlap. Had a small pot, so got many layers: sauce, noodle, cheese, noodle, sauce, noodle, cheese, noodle, sauce (then topped with Mozza in last 1/2 hour).  It scooped out of the pot in a perfect stack and looked gorgeous!

I used Italian sausage, fresh basil, minced garlic, and ricotta cheese-plus sprinkled Parmesan cheese on each level as well. Family loved it, and it's even better the next day!

This was great! It was half the work of the traditional way I make lasagna and I was able to turn it on to cook and leave to run my errands without worry. Five stars are not enough!

We used our own recipe for the lasagna, but followed these directions for cooking it in the crock pot. After reading the reviews, we added extra water to our homemade sauce, used no boil noodles and made sure we had enough sauce to cover the top layer of noodles. Cooked on LOW for 4 hours, added cheese to the top and then cooked on HIGH for another 30 minutes until cheese was melted- It was perfect! We will be using this method again.

I will definitely pre-cook the noodles next time as they came out tough and gummy with uncooked edges.  I even added a cup of water to the slow cooker to help cook them but they were still undercooked.  The meat sauce was very tasty, and should make for a great lasagna if I figure out the noodle part.  I cooked on low for 6 hours.  Also used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

I made this recipe tonight and my family really liked it. I cannot say that there is a big difference between the oven lasagna I make and the one in the slow cooker because it was very similar. As far as convenience I feel that if you want to prep the recipe in the morning and not have to worry about it then it will be worth the effort, otherwise you can just use the traditional oven method since the result will be similar. Some changes I made to the recipe were I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also added two eggs to the cheese mixture. I also substituted the sauce with traditional marina sauce and seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, oregano, minced garlic and onion. Finally I added mozzarella cheese to the top of the lasagna the last 30 minutes in the slow cooker. Totally cook time was 5 hours on low. Make sure you break the noodles to fit in the slow cooker and you double the noodles each layer and they are covered entirely so they will cook well.

I prefer to use only jarred pasta sauce with mine instead of tomato paste and jarred sauce, so the recipe as written is only 3 stars. Here's a tip for oddly shaped crock pots. Soak your lasagna noodles in hot tap water for 2 minutes, drain and use immediately (or they will stick together). This makes them more pliable and easier to fit the exact shape of your crockpot. I find breaking them sometimes breaks the whole noodle into shards and that's no fun!

This turned out GREAT for us. Used large crock-pot so there were only 2 total layers and the pasta (generic store brand) cooked al dente! I do recommend omitting the salt altogether. Also, with less layers, our dish was ready 3 hours after putting it in the crock-pot on low heat.

This recipe deserves 5 stars for flavor & overall yumminess. However, it loses a star due to the fact that it really is not any easier than making traditional lasagna. The next time I will just bake this in the oven. When I choose slow cooker recipes, usually time is of the essence. The prep time for this lasagna is equivalent to the prep time for an oven-baked lasagna. Therefore, this recipe is pointless for the slow-cooker in my opinion. Some helpful pointers: 1) If you do make this in your slow cooker, make sure your top layer is sauce. If your top layer is noodles, or cheese w/ noodles underneath, then your noodles will be dry & chewy. 2) If you prefer your lasagna with ricotta cheese, then by all means substitute the ricotta for the cottage cheese. I made this w/ ricotta b/c that it what I prefer, and I was pleased w/ it. 3) If you are looking at this recipe & wondering if the 1 1/2 tsp of salt is necessary, it is not. I substituted a salt free seasoning (there is one on this website), and the flavor was still amazing...with a little less sodium.

Excellent!!!  This one was a huge hit...  a few changes though.  I used minced onion as I don't like the texture of onion and soy ground round instead of ground beef because I'm a vegetarian.  I would say it definitely needs a little water or extra sauce so there is enough of the sauce mix to go around.  Also, when my Mom made this she added egg to the cheese mixture and used extra cottage cheese as well.  All around delicious as is or with some tweaking, will be making this one again and again!

This is an awesome recipe!  My lasagna came out perfect!  I used jar spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato paste/sauce and did add some water.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and low for 2 hours and it was perfect!   Will definitely make this again!

I give this 4 stars because I found the lasagna to be a bit soggy. I put water in as the others recommended. I had it on "keep warm" which is less heat than low. It burned on one side. The taste was good but I think I prefer the more crispy version that you bake. Very ingenious, though, to make a lasagna in the slow cooker!

I am rating this for the method since I love anything made in a crockpot.  I omitted the meat, sauted onion, garlic, red & green peppers and zuccini and added that to the layers.  I also added an egg and chopped spinach to the cheese mix and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and the noodles didn't have to be watched and turned out perfect.  My husband who lived in Italy for a couple years said it was the best lasagna he has ever had. I loved that I didn't have to pre cook the noodles or heat up my house using the oven.

I used a 15oz can of diced tomatoes to help with liquid, as others suggested. I also used my favorite jar of sauce instead of paste. I slow cooked it for 3 hours on high and it was perfect. (Adding a little cheese on top at 2 1/2 hours) First time you make this, you do need to keep an eye on it so it doesn't dry up or cook too much. Make sure sauce covers all the noodles. Nice and easy way to make lasagna in a slow cooker. This is a keeper!

I donno. Maybe lasagna isn't for the slow cooker :( Mine was soupy in the middle and burnt on the edges and the noodles were unpalatably mushy and the sauce tasted burnt. Everyone ate it but now I want "real" lasagna. So sad.

I tweaked the recipe to the extent that I'm not really sure I followed the recipe :) I always make my own sauce, so I didn't follow that part of the recipe, and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also didn't pre-mix the cheese or even measure it out - consequently, it's my own fault that there wasn't enough cheese in it! I cooked it on low for about four hours and then switched it to warm - two hours later it looked charred but wasn't any more than a bit brown around the edges! I used regular noodles, and they turned out just great. I'll be tweaking the version of the recipe that I used this round, but I'll DEFINITELY be making it again!

This was good, but the time in the crock pot was too long.  I would say four hours at most for this one.  Worth another try.  Everyone liked it once I removed the top layer which was hard and crusty and overcooked.

This lasagna is the best I've ever had!! It even beats my Mom's old recipe made from scratch. I was a little skeptical at first about whether the noodles would cook enough in this recipe. The only changes I made were to add about half a can (about 14 oz) of water to the meat/sauce mixture and I did add about 2 Tbsp of sugar. My husband raved about this dish and was so excited today to be taking the leftovers for lunch! I will definitely be making this one again!

I made two batches and cooked one in the crock pot and the other in the oven.  The crock pot noodles were way too mushy and pasty.  I added extra water as some suggested and cooked on low for less time but it turned out wrong and I blame the crock pot method.  The oven cooked recipe worked fine and the noodles had their "normal" consistency.

I made this last night, tastes just like lasagna that you make in a pan, only not in uniform size.  I used tomato basil sauce and found I did not have tomato sauce or paste so used diced tomato's instead. Very easy and good, will make again.

Followed recipe, except used one can spaghetti sauce and one 8 oz can tomato sauce and a little water and seasoned it up with lots of garlic.  I think I would use ricotta cheese next time, the cottage cheese seemed to disappear. It was really very tasty and the layers stayed together.

Why would I want to have to first cook the sauce and meat and  and make the lasangna and then cook for 6 hours when i can get the same in 2 hours? This recipe does not make sense.Slow cookers are to save time on treasured recipes that would take alot of time in the kitchen otherwise,Lasangna is not a slow cooker recipe! Tried it just out of curiosity,was dry and took almost 45 min to prepare befor even putting in the crock.Just thought i give my 2cents worth! urbanbanjogurl

Yum! With a few tweaks, this was really good. I used 3/4 lb. ground beef, added a can of diced tomatoes with their juice (since others said it was on the dry side), and some Italian seasoning. I cut the salt down to 1 tsp. (but next time will cut back a little more because I don't like a lot of salt). I used the whole 16 oz. container of cottage cheese. I left it in my crock pot accidentally for 8 hours so the noodles were a little softer than I'd  like, but it was still very good. Next time I'll leave it in for about 6 hours and might try spinach and mushrooms instead of ground beef, just for a healthy change of pace.

Delicious!  I used a 15oz container of ricotta for the cottage cheese and a dollop or two of sour cream and it tasted awesome!  Definitely make sure you have the noodles well covered in sauce and you'll have a delicious meal in no time!

Personally, I think this is a great idea...most women these days don't have time to make a perfect Italian meal for their family (or in my case the men in the house...two great guys my man and our son).  But with this Slow Cooker Lasagna...it's like i took all day to prepare it lol.  Kari Star

I added one cup of water to the sauce, used regular noodles, and omitted the salt. Perfect.

This was OK.  My husband hated it but my 4 year old loved it!  I used the oven ready noodles, which my grocery store sold for the same price as regular, only 9 oz instead of 12 oz.  I took 3oz fewer carbs and called it good!  The flavor was OK but nothing special.  I could hardly taste the cheese part and there was too much sauce.  I won't be making it again.

I have made this recipes so many times - it's a family favorite. I have taken this simple recipe and simplfied it further by using my favorite jar of Spaghetti Sauce. I also prefer to use Ricotta instead of Cottage Cheese.

This lasagna is simple and very good.  It doesn't really need the salt, so I left it out the second time.  I also found that it only took 3-4 hours to cook in my slow cooker, so keep a close eye on it while cooking.

Much better than any frozen lasagne on the market that one can buy but I felt the noodles tasted "starchy".  Will make again but, if time permits, will use my standard recipe where noodles are cooked and washed.

Sometimes, easy is over rated. Difficult to spoon out of our "high" slow cooker. Looked a mess when served. Taste wise...nothing much to recommend either. I really hate to say this but a waste of good ingredients.

This is always a big hit at potluck dinners.  Instead of the traditional lasagna noodles, I use rotuno noodles, or any type that's fat and round.  OH... and definitely use ricotta cheese instead of cottage.

I would probably tweak this recipe a bit for next time.  I loved the ease of cooking it in the slow cooker, but felt that something was lacking taste-wise.  Perhaps it was the sauce......  Easy though--I'll work with it.

I used a 40-ounce jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato paste and sauce and used oven-ready lasagna noodles. My family loved it. It was quick and easy to assemble. However, next time I will use regular noodles as the oven-ready noodles were just a tad on the soft side, but still good. Also, only 2.5 hours in my slow cooker for this and it was done.

Very good.  I've made it several times and my family loves it- but I usually cook it on low for 4-4.5 hours, as other reviewers have suggested.  Today I also added some (thawed) frozen spinach in with the cheese mixture, and it was delicious!

I did not care for this at all and if it were up to me I would have given it 1 star. But my husband said it was good and my 6 year old liked it as well. Six to eight hours is too long for this dish. The noodles were mushy yet it wasn't very saucy. Also did not like the flavor. To be fair I think it was more due to the fact that I make a good oven lasagna and prefer it instead. Still thanks for the recipe because it was quick, easy and much cheaper than the what I usually make.

This was very good and really easy.  Hoorah for not having to cook the pasta!  Anyway, even my husband, who turns up his nose at anything with an Italian food name that's not "authentic" and prefers his own lasagna above anything, thought this was "really good".  The recipe just about filled my 5qt. pot, so be sure to use a large crockpot or scale the recipe.

I had to change the recipe just slightly, based on what I had in the house, so I used a jar of pasta sauce and a can of diced tomatoes instead of the 29 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also added a teaspoon each of dried oregano and parsley to the cheese mixture.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and was sure to make the last layer in the slow cooker the meat sauce and to only cook on low for about 4 hours.  I also put some cheese (both mozzarella and parmesan) on the top.  That clarified, it tasted very good.  It was easier to make than regular lasagna, mostly because I didn't have to boil the noodles.  But it was a lot mushier than regular lasagna, and the difference in texture was enough for to call it "not quite lasagna."  Because it only cooks for 4 hours, it's not necessarily any more convenient, either, for people who work outside the home.  If I want to go to the trouble of making lasagna, I will stick with the American Lasagna recipe found on this site.

This lasagna was quite easy to prepare.I cooked mine for 4 hours and it came out great..not burnt or soupy as others commented. The flavour was good,I suggest adding mushrooms or spinach,or whatever you like- to liven it up a little.I will definately make this again adding some extras.Give it a try!!

I agree with other reviewers, i only cooked the lasagna for 3 hours on low heat and it turned out great. The only thing different i would do next time is use less lasagna noodles-thought it was a bit much with whole box.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made sure to read reviews and get everyone's ideas and mishaps before starting.  I used the ground beef and added three mild italian sausage liks, cut up, and a chopped zucchini to the pot.  I also used two jars of spaghetti sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce and I omited the salt and oregano.  Mine was a little soupy in the beginning, but as it cooled it came together nicely.  It was more of a lasagna casserole, but my family loved it.  I cooked it on high for about 2 1/2- 3 hours.  I will definelty make this one again!

Oh, SO delicious!  I am eating the leftovers from this recipe right now.  I was completely over the moon about a lasagna recipe that doesn't require heating up the oven (which in turn heats up my tiny apartment unbearably) and the fact that it turned out amazingly well and got raves from the friends I had over after church put this one at the top of my list.  I agree with the other reviewers-- 8 hours is too long.  I put everything together while I was getting ready for church and by 1 o'clock when we all got back, it was perfect, brown and caramelized on the sides (mmm, my favorite) and gooey and cheesy in the middle.  I also added chopped zucchini to the sauce and frozen spinach to the cheese part just for a few more vitamins.  Amazing!

We had this for dinner last night - it has a lot of potential! It seemed really salty to us, and I measured out my salt. Next time I think we'll brown the beef but then add a store-bought bottle of sauce - that would be an easy way to speed up this recipe. And, the cheese layers reduced so much you didn't even know they were there! So next time, we'll double the cheese part. But, we will definitely try it again. We love lasagna, but by the time we get home from work, we don't want to wait 2 hours to eat - this is a great way to still enjoy lasagna in a timely manner!

I have made this several times with mixed results. I cant figure out why, either. First time I made this it was fabulous. After that a few misses/hits. I made this again last night, thinking I had learned my lesson, but it was terrible.  I think I know the trick(s)- lots of sauce, not too many noodles, and cooked on low for LESS than 5 hours.  I cooked it last night for 6 and it was a burned, dry, disaster.  Don't give up on this- it can be the best lasagna you will ever eat- and easiest,too. But it does need to be babied.

After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to use a jar of spaghetti sauce for a better tasting sauce. I also added two eggs to the cottage cheese and parmesan cheese (got this from my spaghetti pie recipe idea). I added 1/2 cup of red cooking wine for more moisture. It tasted fine, but nothing spectacular. I remembered to make the last layer to be the meat topping, so the noodles did end up cooking thoroughly (I used extra wide egg noodles). They had a bit of a mushy consistency, which I wasn't wild about. Overall, my teenager liked it and I might make it again.

I threw it together before work and came home to the wonderful aroma of homemade lasagna.  It went together super quick and I had to bake mine like 10 hours but it still came out great.  Alittle brown around the edges -- but we like ours that way.

This is a great idea that didn't work well.  It was way over done.  The noodles were mushy and the cheese mixture disappeared.  I might try it again but use more cheese and cook for a much shorter time period.

I used turkey sausage in the recipe rather than ground beef and it was very good.  I also chose to use ricotta rather than cottage cheese and added some italian seasoning.  I cooked it for only 4 hours which was plenty.  My whole family enjoyed it.

Juding from the mixed reviews, this turned out about how I expected. It was quick & easy enough to throw together, but the taste and texture were lacking a bit. The texture to me was almost "pasty".  It was as if the noodles turned really starchy and that was a bit of a turn-off. If I made this again, I'd definitely pre-cook the noodles for a few minutes and use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

Good results.  I cooked it 5hrs on low, and noodles were still a bit firm.  Could still use some "tweaking".  I added mushrooms to the meat sauce, and spinach to the cheese layer.  Worked out well.  I would recommend putting in some more flavouring though.  I will keep trying this one.

I had to wonder if I was doing this right... I have to admit, I was really nervous making this.  For some reason, I was sure I was going to mess it up.  When I make regular lasangne, I use cooked pasta... to use raw pasta just seemed weird.  However, we all loved the taste of this and it came out perfect.  Don't change a thing!

I'm going to give it 5 stars even though I changed it a bit.  I took previous advice and precooked the noodles for 8 minutes, and only used 1/2 package (9 noodles).  Then I eliminated the cottage cheese, added 4 oz. cheddar, skipped the tomato paste and added a can of diced tomatoes, and added basil, bayleaf, onion and garlic salt, and cooked for 3 1/2 hours.  IT WAS FABULOUS!

I am 13 years old and I got a slow cooker for christmas. I really love cooking. 
When I saw this recipe I knew it would be a winner. It turned out GREAT! My  
whole family loved it. My mom doesn't have time to make homemade lasagna anymore 
so we stuck to the store bought ones. This recipe is as good (even better) than
our traditional one. Everybody was suprised that it held together very well and 
that the leftovers still tasted wonderful after being re-heated. Kim, if you have 
other slow cooker recipes, please put them on allrecipes.com. I will surely try them out.
THANKS A MILLION!!!!!!!!!

My family really liked it.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and it was very tasty.  A little dry on sides so next time I will add more pasta sauce to make it as thin as tomato sauce.  The smell of it cooking spreads throughout the house.

I made a few adjustments, mainly switching the cottage cheese for ricotta, and using one of my favorite pasta sauces instead of the tomato stuff here. I layered it in the slow cooker and three hours on low was PERFECT. I will make lasagna like this from now on. SO EASY! Note, I have an oblong slow cooker, so the ingredients didn't go as far. I added another jar of sauce and another 16 ounce bag of mozzarella to complete three layers.

It was easy.  I substituted ground turkey for the hamburger to reduce the total fat and couldn't tell the difference.Also, I used equal amount of Prego pasta sauce instead of a can each of tomato paste and sauce.  I invited company for dinner.  Four of us ate the WHOLE THING!! Cooked about 6 hrs. on high.

I made this last week and fed 5 people with leftovers. It was very good, so gets 5 stars although it did come out dry . That was partly my fault. I prepared this the day before and had my husband cook it. I forget to tell him to add water or more sauce as suggested by other reviews.  Also used Prego sauce for ease, and used ricotta as suggested.  Will make again.  It was easier than an oven baked lasagna. Thanks.

I cook and freeze my meat sauce. Then I put in the camper refrigerator. After a few days when its thawed, I throw it together before we go out fishing and it is ready to go when we get back! No cooking late and since I use a liner, no clean up! Its a great change when we our camping.

I used the regular lasagne no boiling before hand. I did read the instructions but just did like regular oven lasagna. Cooking time 2.5  hours on high. Had everything assembled night before and refrigerated. Haven't cut into it yet but the sample was delish!!!

I made this for the first time this week, as per the recipe, and it was wonderful!  My husband loved it!  I didn't have to watch the lasagna, wasn't too salty, and since I cooked it about 5 or 5.5 hours (not sure) the burnt/crispy edges tasted amazing.  I know, I was shocked too.  I can't cook very well at all but this turned out great!  Thank you!

This recipe turned out amazing.  I used jarred arrabiata sauce, a full 24oz of 2% cottage cheese and extra mozzarella and parmesan.  I didn't add the extra salt as the jarred sauce has more than enough.  

This is way too decadent for a slow cooker recipe.  As another reviewer said, "It's too easy to taste this good."  

Will make again and again....at least until the doctor tells me to stop.

I make this in my large slow cooker quite often and it's a big hit. I use cottage cheese and ricotta, as well as prepared sauce. It always comes out great. I also use a liner to alleviate cleanup.

This was delicious.  I had just made homemade spaghetti sauce so I used some of that instead of tomato sauce. This will become a regular.

Awesome recipe!!!  I used ground chicken instead of ground beef and I cooked the meat with an Italian seasonings blend. Lots of compliments from the recipe.

I have only made this a few times now, but it's  a hit every time. The first time I made it for an office potluck with rave reviews. I have made it as written and love it. In a rush, I have used a "jug" of Ragu classic sauce and that was equally as good. This is a winner and just too easyl.

Easy recipe and everyone enjoyed.  I will add this to my crockpot recipe rotation.  I threw an egg and a little garlic powder into the Ricotta cheese (I did not use cottage cheese).  I also used 2 large cans of tomato sauce.

This was Fantastic but I do have to say I made some changes. I added 3 links of mild sausage (remove casings) and brown that with beef,  onions and garlic . Instead of tomato sauce I used crushed tomatoes 2 cans and added a little water to rinse the paste can with. I used Ricotta cheese instead of Cottage and added an egg to the ricotta( mix well) I also added fresh basil and oregano to my sauce.   Use oven ready lasagna noodles ( do not cook) layer this as noted  but add mozzarella to each layer . and refrigerate over night ( This allows for the meat and noodles to pick up the flavors) In the morning cook on low for 5 hours and if you work adjust your crockpot to keep warm after the 5 hours. Make sure you have enough sauce to cover the top . Add top layer of Mozzarella 1/2 hour before serving. My family told me this was as good as the homemade lasagna   that I slave over all day. .

Love this recipe! I made a few changes, now it's perfect. First, I switched out the cottage cheese for ricotta. I didn't add any extra salt, and I used extra tomato sauce. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING OVEN READY NOODLES! They are with the boil to cook lasagna noodles. This will help make your recipe work much better. I cooked my lasagna on low for 3 hours and it was done. I also put an extra layer of shredded cheese on top for extea deliciousness. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Quick and easy. Very filling.

I love to eat but don't like to cook, so have avoided making lasagna, too involved. This recipe was very simple, and delicious. I did use hot Italian sausage rather than ground beef to spice it up a little. The first time I made it I thought it slightly dry so the second go round I used a second can of tomato sauce rather than tomato paste. I also used ricotta cheese as I don't care for cottage cheese.

My boyfriend and I just made this today, and we were surprised that it turned out so well! This dish is absolutely delicious.  I also read reviews before I made it, and one of the changes that I did make to the dish is that I substituted the cottage cheese with Ricotta cheese, which by the way was a wonderful substitute :) I would definitely make this again but maybe next time, just give it four hours exactly because we give it four and a half hours and it was a little dark around the edges.  So be careful with the time.  It really depends on your crockpot.

This will be my go to lasagna recipe from this day forward. I was a bit sceptical of it, but decided to give it a go anyway and I'm so glad that I did. Me being me, I altered it only slightly,  i.e., I had left over Italian sausage, capsicum (bell peppers, red and green), and carrot that I added to the meat sauce along with some Italian seasoning and onion powder (on top of the onions already in it). And I let it simmer for a good hour to hour and a half. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and two eggs slightly beaten along with the mozzarella and Parmesan. I used gluten free lasagna sheets. Layered as directed and cooked on low for six hours, it was definitely done at the five hour mark. This is a great recipe, thank you for sharing!

This was really good and so easy. Hubby made it in our crockpot since we are remodeling our kitchen and don't have an oven. This is our second time making it, this time with sausage, and will definitely make again!

I was looking through my 'recipe box' and wanted to write a 5 star review for this dish...although it's been a little while since I made it,I've told soooo many people how easy it was to layer all the ingredients and walk away,only to come home to a absolutely deeeeelicious meal. A 'keeper' for sure.

My husband specifically requested that I make a "crockpot lasagna" so I went on a search to find a recipe. I came across this one and decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I read through the reviews first. There is no way that this would take 4 hours to cook even on low without adding water to it first.  I chose to make the recipe as is but followed other reviewers advice that it only takes a couple of hours to cook and to keep an eye on the noodles. I'm glad I did because exactly two hours later I started to smell it burning and when I tested the noodles they were nice and soft.  My husband was very happy with the result, though, and said that it is a winner. Since all 3 of my boys also devoured it, I have to agree.  Personally, I thought it was kind of bland and needed more seasoning but I'm not a big lasagna eater. I give it 4 stars because it did turn out good but not at the time the recipe calls for.

awesome!  careful on the cook time, my pasta overcooked.  Must have something to do with each brand/size of crock pot.  Just watch your noodles towards the end.  DELICIOUS, though - and super easy compared to the traditional route.

I made this for my family and they said it was the best lasagna they every had. I did however make a few changes. I mixed ricotta cheese, small curd cottage cheese, with mottzarella cheese, along with Monterey Jack cheese.  For the meat I used pork sausage and turkey burger. Cooked on high until it stared to bubble then turned to low for 5 hours. Also a great way to remove the lasagna from crock pot , if you don't want it to be so sloppy I put the pot in the fridge for about 30 mins then cut out and put it on plates, then placed in microwave for few mins. Looked nice and tasted fantastic.

We really enjoyed this lasagna - the taste was outstanding - but this came out on the dry side for me.   Next time I will add more liquid to the sauce as the noodles need the extra moisture to absorb.     I used bulk italian sausage - Johnsonville makes a mild Italian in bulk form that is DELISH and has very little fat to drain.    As other reviewers, I did not add any extra salt since I used Rao's Marinara (it's a little pricey but it's the closest thing to a New York Grandma's home-made sauce I have found so it's worth the cost to me).    I will also add egg to the ricotta cheese mixture for extra moisture and to make it easier to spread.   I put some additional shreddedd mozzarella on top, set it on low and let it cook for 5 hours.    When I make it next time I will watch it since I will be adding more moisture.   It may need the 5 hours or it might be done in less.    I think once you know how to make it in YOUR crockpot with the ingredients you like to use and your custom touches, it will become a "set and forget" meal.     It's worth spending your first time or two getting the timing and technique pefected cause making lasagne this way is a whole lot easier than the traditional way without compromising the result.

It cooks in 2 hours. If you leave it longer the cheese burns. I'll probably add more meat next time, but I liked the taste for a basic lasagna. Easy recipe.

This recipe was awesome, easy and surprisingly straight forward. 

I went for really good parmesan cheese and added 1 can of chopped green chile - that's the New Mexico in me

This rates a 5 star because of the method.  Of course it's also an easy recipe to alter according to individual tastes!  To the person who doesn't see the benefit of this method, I guess it depends on your perspective.  If I'm going for a nice Italian inspired menu to serve my guests, I agree that the traditional oven recipes are better, both for ease (no guessing when it's done) and presentation.  However, to put this in the slow cooker on a Saturday afternoon, go for a long hike or bike ride (or tackle the yard work!) and know that it's going to be ready when you get back hungry and tired, it's brilliant!

I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. This was my first crockpot lasagna recipe, it was delicious. My whole family loved it. A definite use again recipe.

Pretty good.  Don't cook it too long though.  I let it go for 6 hours and that really dried it out, but it was still good.  Also I didn't have ground beef so I used sausage.  Really good flavor and a nice easy alternative to my typical lasagne.

I love it... I was thinking about what I want to make for dinner using my Slow cooker. Then it dawned on me that I recalled hearing about slow cooker lasagna, and I had to find the recipe. 
This really fits the bill for an easy dish. Thanks.

My first lasagna!  Made as suggested, but played with the timing and temp.  About 3 hours on high then down shift to 6-8hr temp for the last hour or so.  Slow cookers seam to very.

I admit I was skeptical of lasagna in a crockpot but I was so happily proved wrong! My family of picky eaters loved it! The only things I changed was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I added about teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

The flavor is amazing. This is my second meal I've probably ever cooked. I'm 24 and learning to cook. It's been cooking for 4 hours and the noodles in the middle are still a little too hard so I'm cooking for another hour on high and hoping that will help

5 stars from our home! I made minor changes due to what I had on hand (ricotta cheese, and turkey meat I cooked with fresh onion, garlic, and Italian seasoning). 

Slow Cooker wad helpful as I was able to tend to my rambunctious 1 and 3 years old sons.  

I read a lot of reviews prior to making this so I was quite concerned about dryness. I added half a can of water over the top for good measure.  Turned out wonderfully.  My husband said this was one of the best pasta dishes I've made. A new staple recipe in our home!

This was an easy lasagna that turned out great! I substituted tomato basil spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato paste and sauce. I also diluted the sauce by using the spaghetti sauce jar half full of water.  Adding a little water helped to keep the noodles moist. Also, no need to add extra salt. All in all my family loved it!

Did everything according to the recipe. Make sure you do not end with pasta on top, put sauce on top to help the pasta cook. Turned out great. Unfortunately there is prepping for this having to cook the meat and mixing, but cooks quickly.

Made this yesterday - it was so easy and wonderful!!  I didn't have an onion so just added some minced onion (spice) and onion powder.  I also added about half a pound of pork sausage with the lean hamburger meat for a little different flavor.  I used a whole 16 oz container of cottage and ricotta cheeses and mixed those with about 3/4 of a container of the parmesan.  I used uncooked wheat lasagna noodles and did add the water (mixed with a shot of red wine) around the edge right before I started cooking it.  I ended up blotting some of the liquid off the top but it was absolutely amazing!  It was ready in about 4 1/2 hours.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was dubious about the idea of putting uncooked pasta in the slow cooker, but by golly, it worked like a charm! This was delish, even using textured vegetable protein and mushrooms in place of the meat, and I will be making it again and again!

Super easy recipe - I always like to use half pound italian sausage, half pound ground beef to give it more flavor. I would stick to 4 hours cooking time, then turn it off to let rest, so you don't dry it out.  Easy and delicious - thanks!!!

We tried this yesterday and it wasn't bad.  I made it without onions since no one else in our house likes them and instead of using tomato paste next time, I would use all tomato sauce and add mushrooms for taste.  The paste seemed to make it a little dry.  I also used garlic salt instead of the minced garlic and regular salt listed in the recipe.  Overall, it's easy to make and tastes good.

Made this a couple months ago and again today.  It is awesome!  I used Ricotta Cheese (used the whole container) instead of Cottage Cheese just for personal preference. One thing that works much better though is mix up the parmesan and ricotta cheese's first then slowly mix in the shredded mozzarella.  It just incorporates it all much better.  I don't have an option to cook any less than 8 hours so I just make sure the cheese mixture and hamburger mixture touches all the noodles and I have no problems of it being too dry.  Yummy recipe that my whole family loves!

Very good, wonderful base recipe for the slow cooker. Made it twice, once the original recipe and found it a bit bland. So I made it again for a dinner party. Assembled it the night before, I have a large slow cooker and this recipe doubled well. cooked on low for about 3 hours and hight for 2 more when I started out cold out of the fridge. I have to say it really depends on you slow cooker size and model.  I used ricotta mixed with egg instead of cottage cheese and added a good amount of Italian seasoning to kick it up a bit on flavour. I did not cook the noodles and every thing was perfect.

Had this for dinner and we thought it was great! Did read the reviews and replaced cottage cheese with ricotta and added basil, thyme, rosemary, and extra tomato sauce. Left it in the crockpot for 4 hours on low. Topped with extra mozzarella cheese. Did finish it in the broiler to get that extra crunch on the top. A keeper and def room for creativity according to your own tastes. We're going to used sausages and extra hot spices next time. should be good!

We tried this recipe tonight and I have to agree agree with several other reviewers that you have to add water in the amount of equal to the tomato sauce in order to have this cook for 6 hours in a slow cooker. It is a great recipe I added more cheese, more meat and some basil and additional Italian seasoning and some black pepper.  We did not use cottage cheese or ricotta which is our family preference it was fantastic with just the mozzarella and parmesan.

If you purchase precooked (dry) lasagna noodles everything is faster and you don't need extra liquid except for tomato sauce and white cheese sauce if you are using it. We don't use any other kinds of noodles anymore-AND you can get them in gluten free rice etc.

At first, I was disappointed. Before refrigerating, the lasagna tasted overcooked and impossibly salty. However, after standing in the fridge for a couple of hours, it really improved; the saltiness became tolerable and the flavors started to shine through. Now after two days in the fridge it's even better, but it's not amazing. It's overcooked--the ricotta and other cheeses are too rubbery but the flavors are all there, at least and it does taste pretty good. 

I cooked it for 4 hrs on low. Then it was kept warm for about 5 hours while I wasn't home. Wondering if that caused it to be overcooked or if 4 hours on low is too much.  It was burned around the edges pretty significantly, and I'm thinking the keep-warm feature couldn't have caused that. Next time, I'll try to check on it periodically.

One very good thing though is that the noodles turned out at perfect consistency. You *do not* have to use no-boil noodles. I used regular, whole wheat noodles and they came out perfectly.

As others have noted, forego adding any salt. I think it's the can of tomato paste that risks making this lasagna way too salty. I didn't add any salt--and in fact I made my own tomato sauce from scratch and didn't add any salt to it, but I think it's the tomato paste that really did it with the salti-ness. 

Overall, because it's so much easier to make than oven lasagna, I would make this again. 3.5 stars.

Cooked this tonight for supper.  Followed the directions to a T.  After 4 hours the sides were overcooked but the noodles were undercooked.  Could not eat it.

simple week night meal.  I was in a hurry so I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce, paste and seasonings.  I ended up with a really great meal.

My new way to make lasagna.  Was very easy to make and tastes great.  I did use spaghetti sauce from a jar and used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I slow-cooked on low for 5 hours.  Everything came out perfect, I couldn't believe the noodles so well because they were just regular uncooked lasagna noodles not the special kind that you don't have to cook first.

This recipe has great promise!  Next time I will replace the cottage cheese with ricotta as the cc was too gritty and you need to add more water, enough to rise to the top of the noodles when you start cooking. Add 1 cup of water. 4 hours on high and it was great!,

This is the easiest way to make lasagna.  This ws my first lasagna and it came out great! Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey.  I would recommended using more sauce.  Once it starts to cook the noodles suck up all the sauce.  Besides that one change, I followed the recipe exactly the way suggested.

One of my absolute favorite recipes!!  I actually didn't have enough parmesan cheese for the recipe, but it still tasted delicious with the little I put.  The sauce was perfect and everything was ready to go in 4 hours.

This is the first time I have ever burnt anything in a crockpot.  I thought that was impossible to do, but after 4 hours on low, I had to turn the crockpot to the "warm" setting for the last hour before dinner.  I was surprised to see a thick layer of burnt pasta/sauce all around the edge of the crockpot.  We ate from the middle, and what we had tasted all right.  My kids complained that the sauce tasted "odd," but I think it was because everything was just a big mushy mess.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, had plenty of liquid, but just didn't like the way it came out. Not a good dinner plan for our family. I'll stick with oven- baked lasagne.

This was very easy to make, and these days with busy schedules just what I need. I followed the recipe exactly as written and have to agree with others it is a bit dry. Next time I will add more tomato sauce, but will definetaly make again.

Love this recipe! After reading previous tips, I decided to add a splash more of water, and I did that by somewhat filling the cans of tomato sauce and paste to get the rest of it out. Worked perfectly! Also, I added cheddar to the top, I LOVE crispy cheese on the top. I let it cooked for 6 hours, and it was perfect. Will be using this recipe often.

I used a 51/2 quart crock pot.  After five hours, it was burned on the bottom and on the sides.  It was fairly easy and the unburned part tasted good.  I would try cooking it for 3 hours.  I am glad I wasn't serving it to company!   I would give it three stars because of the cooking time.

First of all I have to say, that this recipe as written is BLAND as can be.  We substituted the tomato sauce and paste with a store bought marinara sauce and added extra Italian medley seasoning.  We like the flavor of ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Even with all the changes it was still bland and very mono tone.  I wish I could really reccommend how to "fix" this, but this one escapes me.  We won't be making this one again

I thought this was very tasty but I did deviate from the recipe like the others. I added more seasoning than just salt and oregano because I think canned tomatoes tend to be a bit bland compared to jarred sauce. I also added some cooking wine to the sauce in order to get some more flavor and liquid in there because I was worried it wasn't moist enough to cook the noodles. Mine did burn on the edges so I might try to grease it with olive oil beforehand next time. Overall it was very tasty though and not too dry or runny.

I made recipe with ground turkey and filled the tomato paste can with water and added that.  It was a little dry on the bottom but not bad.  It was rather bland.  I'm chalking that up to the tomato sauce I used and the turkey meat.  May make again but not for a while and will for sure make it differently.  Possibly add more garlic too.

This was good, but no where close to mom's oven-baked version. It does make a TON, so my small family will be halving the recipe next time. We added a little extra water like others, but will use regular pasta next time. The no-boil pasta was gummy after cooking for so long.

I am skeptical of slow cooker pasta dishes, but I decided to try it and I glad I did. My kids and mother in law all loved it. I will definitely make it again! I did not use the tomato paste, but 6 more ounces of sauce and I did not double layer the noodles, and the consistency was perfect.

This was okay. My problem is that I let it cook all day on low while at work. 11 hrs. Way too overcooked. Family ate some.

It was okay but did taste a little bland.  After about 3 hours you have to watch it b/c at 4 hrs the cheese started to be burnt around the edges.  Maybe next time I make this I will make some improvisions.

AMAZING! I used fresh mozarella, heavy cream and parmesan because that was all I had and it turned out great.

This recipe is tasty, although it looks rather like a "dog's breakfast." It's quite mushy - not pretty enough to serve to guests.  I added some chopped onion, red pepper, garlic and mushrooms to the meat in the frying pan. The ricotta, pasta sauce and mozzarella should be mixed first in a separate bowl; otherwise, it is too hard to incorporate them well with the meat and noodles.  If I were to make this again (doubtful), I would substitute noodles such as radiatore or the squiggly shapes for the lasagne noodles.

as per other reviewers' advice, I did double the sauce.  Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe, and loved it. And for me, it was a great solution.  My oven is on the blink right now.  I will likely make this again since it's nice to do all the preparation early in the day and, therefore, get all the clean up done early.

I thought that it was very good. The only things that I did differently is I added a little basil and sage and a can of spaghetti sauce. It turned out GREAT! I will definately be making this again. Next time though I want to try added some stewed tomatoes also. And I just served it with garlic bread. Yum!

This was really good. My only complaint is that the cheese burnt on the sides of the slow cooker, so there was a bit of a charred taste to the lasagna.

this recipe produces a very tasty meal, but not really anything like what you'd get if you baked a lasagne in the oven.  everything really blends together and the dish becomes more of a scooping casserole than anything - but very tasty.  i will definitely make it again, just not when i expect a good "sunday lasagne".  the sauce needs lots of liquid (as all crockpot recipes do) so i would definitely increase the amount of sauce, or it just gets absorbed.  don't listen to other reviews about blandness - this had plenty of flavor!

We didn't care for this recipe at all. As another reviewer pointed out, it didn't make much sense to cook this in the slow cooker, as it takes the same amount of time to prepare the lasagna the "normal" way. Also, it was dry and lacked much taste. The suggested cooking time was way too long.

Hmm...It tasted okay but a bit dry and the bottom layer did burn after 5hrs on low.  I think I'll stick with the pan but glad I tried it.

We really like this lasagna. I read all the reviews first and went from there. Did not add the salt. I seasoned the beef while it was cooking. I sauteed onions & mushrooms to add to the 2 jars of spag. sauce I used. I also used Ricotta instead of Cottage Cheese. Took around 6 hours to cook in my older crockpot.

We really loved this recipe.  I as well played around with it, added twice the amount of tomato paste and sauce and put ricotta instead of cottage cheese in.  I also put half the amount of salt in and it turned out awesome!  We will definately use this over and over again!

Make sure to drain the ground beef after cooking it.  I'm more of a new "cook" and did not see that written down so the meal was sort of greasy.  Overall, it tasted really good.  I used the regular lasagna noodles (not the no-bake ones like others suggested).  I layered everything 3 times and did not cook it for as long as the recipe stated (I did it for about 1-2 hours less).  The edges started getting DARK brown but did not taste burnt like it looked.  I work late in the evening so I can't cook dinner.  I use the slow cooker for all my weekday meals and let it cook overnight.  This was ready for me to "pack" in the morning to take to work and my still tasted good as leftovers.

I get rave reviews with this recipe!  I live in Quito, Ecuador which is 9,000+ feet in elevation.  Most foods take longer to cook at this elevation and I have found that 6 hours is almost too long, 5 - 5.5 hrs is perfect.  If you live at or below sea level I would try cutting the time back to 4 hrs and go from there.  At sea level, if you cook this 6-8 hrs I'd think it would be very dry.  Good Luck!  Buen Provecho!

This lasagna was convenient and smelled wonderful while it was cooking but it was a huge disappointment.  I would recommend not adding salt as it calls for 11/2 tsp. of salt.  It tasted very salty to me and the lasagna noodles were very rubbery and it needs something to make it moister. It was very dry.  Will not make this again.

I definitely want to try this recipe and have read MOST ALL the reviews. MANY THANKS TO ALL OF YOU!  But, please help!  For those who used non-lasagna noodles (e.g., penne pasta or rotuno, etc.),do you pre-cook this pasta at all?  Please post response!

Being a vegetarian, I substituted soy ground round for the beef. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the beef thing) and I added fresh basil when I added the oregano. The end result was great. I did not have to adjust the time at all, 6 hours was perfect. I highly recommend this - it is a no fail lasagna!

Yummy, but we put it together the night before and still was soggy with only 2.5 hours. Probably would be better prepared then heated and served on same day.

With reviewer-suggested changes this is definitely 5 stars. I added bottled sauce, sausage and chopped black olives. I also added (thawed & drained) frozen spinach to the cheese layer. Delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe!

We made this for a potluck at work and it was a hit. Needless to say they scraped the pot clean!

I used one teaspoon of salt and it was still too salty. Very dry also. Won't make again.

I cannot rave enough about this recipe! I love it, love it! Have made it several times, and each time I give the recipes out. I prefer ricotta, but cottage cheese is good to, soooo easy and the flavors blend together beautifully. I will never make lasagna in the oven again!

This was okay. The noodles were not done after a long time cooking and it was kind of dry.  Dont think it is something I would try again.

This was a good starting point.  I added more cheese, used spicy italian sausage, and spiced up the meat a little more with some italian seasonings.  The noodles were still a little chewy after cooking according to the recipe.

Good recipe. I like regular lasagna better. This recipe was a little dry. Maybe I cooked it too long. It is worth it for me to try again.

i do agree 4-4 in a half hours is suffcient time. i would have never thought cottage cheese would have been used in lasagne and you dont even taste it. this is a great and easy recipe and i also used my own sauce. i personally dont care for jar sauce.

I think this would be better with elbows or something other than lasagna noodles, but then it wouldn't be lasagna. They just don't fit well in a crock-pot!  The flavor was ok, but seemed kinda dry.

Thank goodness I read the reviews before I started. I added mushrooms to the sauce (which was from a jar - which worked great) and only cooked it for 3 1/2 - 4 hours.  I started it on high (by accident) for the first 1/2 hour, but I don't think it made much of a difference.  It turned out excellent.  I'm glad I knew to put sauce on top to keep noodles on top moist.  I am definitely going to keep this recipe close at hand.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars. The taste was good and my husband said he liked it but the noodles got very mushy in texture and everything ran together when served. I also think there was a bit too much cheese for my taste. I cooked it for 2 hours on low and 2 hours on high so it would be finished for dinner. It didn't burn because I kept an eye on it but it was difficult to tell when it was ready. I think next time I will do the traditional oven style.

My husband said it was a best lasagna he ever had and lasagna is his favorite food! This was my first attempt at lasagna and it was so easy because you didn't have to boil any noodles like all the other recipes. I did add some italian seasoning to the sauce so it has some flavor and we cooked it on low for 4 hours and the sides came out too burnt so we'll try 3 and a half next time.

YUM!!!  this was so much better than i'd ever thought it would be.  i used ground chicken instead of beef (1st time using it - was really good!), didn't use the onion but used fresh garlic, used vidalia onion & garlic spaghetti sauce, don't think i used all the noodles i was supposed to, used 2% mozzarella and then an italian blend - put most of the italian blend on top - took advice of others and put 1 egg and some sour cream in the cheese mixture - and used 15 ozs ricotta instead of cottage.  cooked on high for 2 hours and low for at least 1 hour - was perfect and even a little burntish on the bottom.  i don't know if i'll ever make lasagna the "traditional" way again!  thanks kim!!

This is one of my most favorite recipe finds.  This lasagna is so good -- my husband said it was "restaurant quality"  I do add fresh spinach on the same layer I do the cheese -- just to add that extra nutrient kick...... but other than that I don't change a thing.

I tried this recipe and was surprised how the cottage cheese tasted great instead of the usual ricotta cheese.  I cooked it for only 4 1/2 hrs though and it still crustified and burnt all on the top and bottom.  The middle part was edible so we ate that part.  My toddler loved it, so I might make it again tweeking the time on it though.  This would be a recipe to cook if you're home... so you can occasionally check on it (through the lid).  It was good though!

I had never before made a lasagna and my family is crazy for this! I have a very old crockpot, so I don't know if that makes a difference, but starting it on high for about an hour, then reducing to low for another hour-and-a-half seems great to us.I have also reduced the salt by half, and added an entire 16-oz. (rather than 12 oz.)container of cottage cheese mixed with sour cream and an egg, thanks to another reviewer.
Delicious every time!

I agree with other reviews that 6 to 8 hours is too long to cook this dish.  The flavor was good so I have given it 3 stars.  But, I also had brown edges and mushy noodles.  I will give this another try but only cook it about 4 hours, it think.

Mine burned, don't ask me how, but if anyone could tell me what I possibly did wrong I'd appreciate it. I followed recipe exactly, but slow cooker on for 8 hrs and came home to a clump in the bottom of my slow cooker...I think there wasn't enough liquid but would truly like some insight.  I am a novice at using my slow cooker!!!!!

This was very good, and I would give it five stars except that it lacked "zip".  I didn't use all the noodles (a mistake).  Both my husband and I thought it would have been better with more noodles.  It was very cheesy.  But to go out for the day and have lasagna ready when you get home is a real treat.  Next time I will spice up the sauce, or maybe use half beef and half sausage.

This was a great recipe with the exception of the cooking time, I think that anyone using this should adjust the cooking time if at all possible, like check it after 3 hours and then maybe every hour if you can.  Alot of the other reviews are very helpful.

I have made this twice this past month and I am still trying to get it just right. The first time the noodles were gummy and there was too much liquid. This last time it had the perfect amount of sauce but the noodles were overcooked and virtually melted in my mouth.  However both times all of the lasagna was eaten!  Next time I will cook for less time and not add any salt, the cheese contributes enough. I love the simplicity of this recipe too much to give up!!

I thought this was great! My crock pot is only a 2.5 quart, so this recipe made 2 batches, but it was delicious. I cooked it for only 4 hours and it turned out great. It was better the second day.  I will definitley make this again, and have already shared it with friends!!

WOW! This was great and easy. Even my picky eater parents liked this. I added sasugase and ricotta cheeze to the exact receipe and it worked out fine. I'll be making this for my mens study group at church next, everyone's been trying to get someone to do lasagna for a while but no one knew of this slow cooker receipe, the olf fashioned oven way is time comsuming. Thanks for a wonderful dish I'll serve forever.

This was great and very easy.  I modified it by using 2 jars of sauce, ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and I added spinach.  Some people complained about the burnt edges - that's the best part of lasagna!!!  Yum!

This was ok, and certainly easy to do, but mine got burnt around the edges after about 6 hours and the lasagna noodles seemed a little too mushy. It was fun to try, but I think I like traditional lasagna better.

This was great! I've made it about 2-3 times now. I think it tastes just like regular lasagna that you'd make in the oven, but a lot easier!!! I made it once for my brother and his wife and their 3 little kids, they all loved it and wanted the recipe!

Not bad, but not great.  I think I will either pre cook the noodles next time, or use egg noodles.  Double layering them left it gooey and mushy, but like I said not bad

This was too easy to be true, but the end results were fantastic.  Dispite all the bad others had to say, I think it came out perfect.  The only thing I changed, was adding a can of petite diced tomatoes, only because I like tomato chunks, but I am sure it didn't change the recipe that much.  Thank you Kim.

Definitely needed more sauce!  Also, don't put noodles too near the top or they end up like leather.

This lasagne was awesome...I did do some changes though...Instead of the cottage change I used sour cream with a beaten egg...Also after reading about dryness I used a 14oz jar of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste and I used spinach lasagne...Everyone loved it...

I only gave this 4 stars because I used our favorite sauce, precooked the noodles first, added a little water to it and I only used mozz cheese {the only kind dh and kids will eat}, I also only cooked it for about 31/2 hours. It came out perfect. My 3 picky kids each had 2 servings, and my dh thought it was great {he is also very picky} I will be making this agian!!

This recipe is great!  It was so easy to prepare I thought for sure it wasn't going to turn out good, but it ended up being spectacular.  Now I'm famous for the slow cooker lasagna.

I have made this several times and it is very good and easy.  My boss even brought her crock pot to work one day and made it to take to dinner that night.  The whole office smelled so good!  I did find you need to add more sauce (I used my own version) then called for because it tends to dry out.  Other than that, perfecto!!!!

I made this last week and it turned out great!  My only change was using regular egg noodles instead of the standard lasagna noodles.  Egg noodles were easier to fit in my slowcooker and has no affect on the taste!

It takes the same amount of effort to put it into a slow cooker for 5 to 6 hours as it does to cook it the oven for an hour.  The taste was excellent, I used canned spagetti sauce and dressed it up a little instead of the tomato sauce.  I would have given it four stars but the rest of the family loved it so I will have to give it the full five.  I was not as impressed with the method of cooking but all turned out well.

The noodles on the top layer did not get done!  Next time I'll save a little of the sauce and put it on top of those noodles.

The only problem I found was the corners of the lasagna burned even with reducing the cooking time. Could be my slow cooker gets very hot. But the receipe was good, family loved it...

Very good.  I liked the consistency.  I did have some problems with burning on the bottom.  If you're home while it's cooking you need to stir periodically.

This one was not good for me. It was way overcooked and the sauce was pretty bland. Really easy to make, but not worth the money for the ingredients in my opinion. I think I'll stick to baking my lasagna.

Excellent and very easy! I have to admit I altered the recipe a bit, but only because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I used dried minced onion instead of fresh, 12oz of pimento cheese spread instead of the cottage cheese, 8oz of shredded mozarella cheese instead of 16oz, 6oz of lasagna noodles instead of 12oz, and added about 1 tsp of pizza seasoning in addition to the other spices listed in the recipe. It was delicious and a hit with my "picky" husband. My daughter wasn't so happy, though:) It was very easy and will make again. Would probably try it with the listed ingredients or maybe with prepared spaghetti sauce as others have done. Thanks for the recipe!

Don't cook on a high temp and cut the time.  The noodles were chewy.  Maybe try cooking the noodles some ahead of time.

Disappointingly, WAY too overdone at 8 hours and actually burnt.  Looked at other comments after the fact and most of them state the same.  You might want to adjust the time in the recipe.  Will try again, but for A LOT less time.

Made this twice.  My family loves it and so do I.  As one reviewer wrote, it is not one for company but it is great.  With my slow cooker, I stick to the 6 hour cooking time otherwise the noodles are overcooked.

I used a store bought sauce and vegetarian ground "beef."  I also followed earlier reviews and used fewer noodles and less cooking time.  My kids and sitter all had three servings.  I will make this again.

this was an easy recipe no doubt. Lacked a bit of flavor though. I think I will tinker with this one a bit. Will definitely keep trying though!

I like a crockpot recipe that allows you to just throw a couple of things in the pot and walk away.  This recipe was a lot of work for a so/so payoff.  For the time I spent preparing this, I could have made real lasagna and I would have been much happier with the results.  I did substitute ricotta ans italian sausage for the cottage cheese and ground beef.  (Cottage cheese in lasagna? EWWW!) This recipe gave me mushy noodles, dried out cheese and disappointed kids. Maybe its because my children have two Italian Grandmothers.  They expect better lasagna.

I thought this was going to be great -- easy and quick in the crock pot.  Well, it was quick and easy, but we ended up dumping it and having sandwiches for dinner.  It was dry, mushy and tasteless.  No one liked it, not me, not my husband, not our daughter.

You really need to cook the lasagna noodles first.  If you don't, even after all day cooking in the slow cooker they are not tender.

I also cut down cooking time to four hours. Delicious! I should have divided cheese and meat mixtures in threes. I only had two layers. It was good though!!! I used 24 ozs. of tomato sauce too. Thanks for recipe!

Would add mushrooms next time and a little more sauce.  I don't know if I had too many noodles for my double layer or what, but it ended up a little dry.  Was very good and will definately make this again.

This recipe was really good, but I made a few substitutions.  I used spaghetti sauce in place of tomatoes and sauce.  I also added a little extra water and cheddar cheese too!  Turned out great, but next time I will only cook for 4 hours max!

I'm afraid that I did not care for this lasagna at all.  The noodles were rubbery and the edges were burnt. Also there was a flavor that was much too strong. I am glad to see that others had better luck. I will not try this one again, however. Happy cooking!

My other half and i loved this recipe. When I made it we used minced dry onion instead of real onion (only onion i can stand)I alos added 2 cans of mushrooms and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. It came out really good but it was a little salty but that didn't stop my other half from haveing 3 helpings plus finishing the little bit on my plate he said we would defiently be making it again.

First, let me say, that this was really pretty good, though, I did omit the salt, and added more water ( but not too much ) ... Of course, there is some preparation, duh!!Why wouldn't there be? Anything that tastes good, surely must have some preparation.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.. Why people, even if they don't like something, have to be so blunt in their reviews is beyond me--It would be a really boring world if we all had the same tastes!!! I will be making it again...

Cooked it for time recommended, and it turned out very dry and even a little burnt.  Was disappointed, but next time will cook for only 5 or 6 hours at the most.

Excellent recipe!  Was not quite as good as Grama's :-) but very easy.  Only mods. I made were to add 1/2 C extra water to sauce then cooked 5 hours on low (it was definitely done).  Next time I'll cook 5 hrs. without the extra water and see if lower noodles turn out perfect (they were a little mushy).

EXCELLENT! - much better than heating up a whole oven for a pan of lasanga.  I experimented a bit today and next time this is what I would do to make it better:  add `1/2' cup water and a layer or two of shredded zuccini and chopped celery (kids won't know the vegys are there!), this adds the extra moisture which is needed.  I will be making it often.  Great for potluck dinners and busy work days (make it the night before and plug it in the next morning.  Naomi

Our family loved it.  Did not mind having to cook the meat first, did it at night so I could put it all together next morning.  Had cooker turn on automatically during the day and supper is ready when we all walk in the door.  Delicious!

This was good, but much too salty. We also found it to be a bit on the dry side. I added about an extra cup of water to thin out the sauce. Next time, I would try canned thick and hearty Ragu pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce and still thin it out with some water. I used ricotta instead of cottage- personal preference.It did take a while to prepare.

I modified the sauce & added more ingredients to the mixture.  I thought just oregano wouldn't be enough spice for me, so I added basil, thyme, rosemary, fresh garlic and heavy cream.  Overall the recipe was simple & I would use it over again.

I did not care for this recipe at all. The crock pot gave the cheese a very rubbery consistency and it did burn around the edges even though I watched it all day. I will be sticking to regular lasagna!

This recipe took more time to prepare than most slow-cookers, but it was worth it.  I too used spaghetti sauce, and it was very tasty.  I was nervous about it being dry so I did add about 2/3 cup of water - good thing.  I found it very salty, next time I would leave it out entirely - I think the cheese has lots of salt.  Next time I'm going to try adding broccoli, zucchini and cauliflower to make it healthier!

I did overcook it and it made it sort of mushy.  I will make this again but when I can be home to watch it so it doesn't overcook.

Turned out really well. Like others I used doctored up jarred sauce and a little extra liquid....enough to cover all the noodles. I seasoned the meat with red pepper flakes and lots of garlic. I used a pizza blend cheese mixed with the cottage, because that's what I had, and mozzarella on top. The no boil noodles worked great in this. The lasagna set up nicely after the five hour mark. Thank you!

I used two jars of spaghetti sauce with ground beef as the base, ricotta instead of cottage cheese.   I used some cheddar on the top along with the mozzarella.  I cooked on low for about five hours.  This is delicious, definitely a keeper.

I never understood the whole cottage cheese thing instead of ricotta when it comes to lasagna, just seems weird, I was raised using ricotta with mozzarella mixed in then extra mozzarella on top. Also I’m so glad I read a lot of the reviews before making this, I was already planning on using my favorite jar sauce just doctored up, I use meatless meat and onions, garlic and a little sugar, my family loves it. I added a little extra water at the advice of others who made this and that was smart, I also pre cooked the noodles and layered it all up and the idea was really just heating everything through evenly. So with my ricotta and mozzarella and garlic mixture that I’ve been using for years and my doctored up jar sauce it came out great, my hubby missed the crispness to the cheese on top but other than that it was great.

This was such a good recipe!! I substituted Ricotta cheese as well.  Just make sure all of the noodles are covered with tomato sauce or add a little water if they are exposed.  I did this and the regular lasagna noodles turned out perfectly!!!  I was scared about the noodles, but it was excellent!!

I only used 1 tsp of salt and found it still a little salty. I cooked it for 5 hours and it seemed burnt around the edges, but it was still very good. I will be making this again. SO EASY!!!

This recipe is DE-LICIOUS! I cooked it on low but 1.5 hours less, added more cheese, substituted cottage with ricotta cheese, and used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Easy peasy and very nummy!

I made this exactly as written and it was great. I’m guessing it depends on your crockpot as to how long to cook,  how much liquid to use, etc., but mine was spot on. I used regular noodles, not the oven ready type, and they were just fine. I used a crockpot liner bag for easy clean up too. Definitely making this again.

Easy to make.  Cooked 5 hours on low and the edges were a little burnt, but the rest of it was very good!

Not sure why this recipe called for cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese? I used ricotta and followed the rest. Never made lasagna in a crock pot before so this was helpful but definitely use  ricotta cheese not cottage.

Cooked as directed. Would probably increase (double) the sauce next time.  Noodles on the top were dry and crunchy. We worked around it though. Hubby and son loved it too. Winner. Will make again - with adjustments.

Our family lives lasagna but it takes so long to prepare that I don't make it often. This recipe though, was great! The only thing I changed was switching cottage to ricotta. It turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again and again.

I have been making this for a number of years.  I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I add italian seasoning, basil and one package (thawed and squeezed) spinach in the sauce mixture. I substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.  I use 2 cups cheddar cheese.  2 cups mozzarella cheese, and 1 cup of parmesan cheese.   It is a family favorite.  There are usually no leftovers since they fight over the crockpot!

Turned out very well.  I had no ground beef so I substituted about 10 sausages and added the entire box of noodles. Increased tomato sauce by a small can.  I used not only cottage cheese less than what it called for and added ricotta.  I froze a lot of it as it sure makes a lot!

Yes, I made it and it was very good but I made a lot of changes because I used the ingredients I had.   I used Italian Pork Sausage, a 24 oz. Jar of Spaghetti Sauce and 8 oz. of Tomato Sauce.  No extra spices were needed and I used less Cheese than the recipe.  Eight oz. of  Mozz. Cheese was more than enough.  But after 3.5 hours on Low, the Lasagne was overcooked.  I will definitely  make again but I'll use a full 16 oz. of Lasagne Noodles and check it after 2.5 hours.

I love this recipe. 
Only substitute I made was using mild Italian sausage instead of beef. Threw in 3 jars of organic spaghetti sauce and about a cup of water. 
Cooked in skillet for 15 min. 
 I used regular lasagna noodles (not oven ready) and it was fabulous. (Omitted salt too). 
Last layer was sauce. Be sure to leave 1-2 inches from top of crockpot to allow for expansion or will boil over when noodles absorb liquid. Cook on LOW about 4 hours. 
 20 min before serving- sprinkle about 1-1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella on top and cover until cheese melts. 

Ps My husband sprinkled a little garlic salt on his as I never added it to the recipe).  It was fabulous. Will make again!  I love that you don’t have to turn your oven on especially if it’s a warm day.

I would use an 80/20 ground beef mixture instead as I think the 90/10 makes it a little too hard a chew. And I used a half ricotta half cottage cheese mix. Other than that it was very good!

Read all
The reviews and tweaked likewise.  Used 2 cans of tomato paste. And 4 cans of water in the tomato
Paste can. One can diced tomatoes.  Other than that stuck to the recipe. Oh used ricotta and also  mixed in an egg with the cheeses.  Cooked on low four hours.  I will never BAKE again.  It’s delicous. And pasta is perfect.  Used regular lasagna noodles.   A def keeper.

I like mine more meaty and cheesy so I added 3/4 lb.each of ground chuck and ground italian sausage (mild), and for cheeses I used a container of ricotta, 8 oz. of wafer thin parmesan,  and 4 oz. each of shredded mozzarella, and grated parmesan and romano cheeses. My husband likes to eat less gluten  so I used GF lasagna noodles and it tasted great - he had two healpings .

I was a little skeptical at first of making lasagna in a slow cooker, but it turned out great.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it doesn't turn out as pretty as traditional lasagna.  I did make a few modifications to the recipe based on how I usually make lasagna.  I did not add my meat to the sauce, I kept it separate, and I only used hot Italian sausage.  I also used ricotta cheese blended with a raw egg, dried parsley, a little salt, and pepper.  I also add a little hard shredded parmesan cheese to the mixture.  On the day I made this I had to work later that I thought and my Crock Pot kept it on warm after the timer went off, by the time I got home the top looked burnt, but it was fine.  It was dark but it tasted fine, and the top wasn't hard.  I will absolutely make this again.

I found it difficult to break up the lasagna noodles so they fit in the slow cooker. Also, mixing cottage cheese and shredded cheese made a sticky goop. It was good, though, and ready to eat when I got off work. 2nd day, though, had to add more liquid. 3rd day, put remainder in microwave bowl. Getting sauce off slow cooker was difficult.

So glad I read some of the other reviews before I made this! I added an entire jar of pasta sauce and we still found it dry. I think I will stick with my own lasagna recipe because by the time it's all put together,  I may as well have made it the traditional way. Also don't like the noodles  doubled up.

This was easy to make and the flavor was wonderful! It could be a little cheese-ier (personal preference), my family loves cheese!

Great recipe!  I added my special touches passed down from my mom and aunt.  We always had lasagna at Thanksgiving and Christmas along with turkey.  Anything in a slow cooker tastes better to me.

This was a delicious meal and my adult children loved it.  I found it just a bit too salty and not quite sure where the salt came from.  I don't think I over-salted the meat, but not sure.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to make. After reading other people's reviews, I did make some changes. First I used a mix of hamburger and Italian sausage.  I used spaghetti sauce and Italian seasoning, as well as ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I chose the oven ready lasagna noodles so  it would cook quicker. I did not add salt because many of the reviews commented that it was salty enough. I cooked it on low and it was ready in 4 hours.My husband said that it was better than baked!

I assemble it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. I take it out about an hour before I cook it. I've never had a problem with it being dry. Have made this multiple times and it always turns out great

I used a lot more sauce than the recipe called for. A 44oz. jar of Prego Italian sausage & garlic flavor, plus 1 - 15 oz.. can of tomato sauce, plus one 12oz. can of tomato paste & a can of water. Mixed it all together with a pound and a half of Italian sausage & ground pork, onions, peppers, mushrooms,  garlic & Italian spices...to taste...16 oz. package of lasagna noodles, the mozzarella, ricotta & parmesan cheese. Put it all together the night before, refrigerated it, then heated it on low for a good 8 hours in my old crock pot. It came out great!! Was in no way too much sauce, covered the pasta well & didnt dry out or overcook. Family loved it & I will make it again!! Also...the reviews from other people were very helpful. Without them this recipe wouldn't have been as good. Thank you all!!

I used the leanest ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I would likely add a bit more moisture so the lasagna noodles weren't so rigid (if that makes sense) or cook a slightly shorter time.  Great taste and EASY!

This is so easy. I use sausage and hamburger for a little different flavor. We love it. Need to freeze half of it or we would be eating it daily for a week!  It is so good. Will be making it this way from now on.

I made this exactly as is. It was awesome. I did use cottage cheese (cause that’s what I had). I ended with last of the sauce and more mozzarella. Cooked on low for 1 hour then high for 2 1/2 hrs. Make sure you spray the crock pot first. To free up my crockpot I used a knife around the edges and flipped onto a plate. It came out and looks awesome!!! I had already taken out a few pieces so I could slide a thin flexible spatula to help it fully release. Loved it

I made this the other night & thought it was very good!  I made some changes though.  I think it's a sin to use cottage cheese in lasagna, so I subbed a 15 ounce container of ricotta cheese & 2 eggs.

I thought it needed a lot more sauce because it was a bit dry.  I used the tomato paste and a 32 ounce jar of jarred tomato sauce & it clearly was not enough.  But that's all I had.  I also didn't use the right amount of mozzerella cheese because I bought  the two cup size instead of doubling it - my bad.

I will make this again!

Love this recipe.  Have made it several times.
It's the best way to make lasagna, because I find it is easier to layer lasagna into a slow cooker than to compose one neatly into a baking dish.  If you have a little extra meat or sauce, you don't have to worry about overflowing the pan.  This recipe is very quick to assemble and very yummy!

First, this was really good! I'm giving it four stars because I made a few changes based on reviews and how it was looking as I prepared it.

I originally made as directed, once I had half the dish layered I was concerned there wasn't enough liquid to really cook the noodles  (I only had regular lasagna noodles not the no-boil kind). I ended up adding a 29 oz can of pureed tomatoes (I added it to the second and third/top meat layer) and then topped off the whole thing with half a can of water. I cooked it on low for 1 hr and on high for 5 hours. I think it would have been done an hour earlier, but overall this was VERY good.

The entire family enjoyed it. I don't have a delayed start on my crockpot - which would really allow for cooking while at work.

I doctored the sauce to near perfection by adding a half stick of butter and adjusting spices to my taste.  Then used 1 pound of Italian sausage with another 1/2 pound of ground beef.  I also used 15 oz. of Ricotta cheese but feel it still could've used the cottage cheese as well.  As amazing as the sauce turned out, I was very disappointed in the overall outcome.  I have a good and very reliable slow cooker, but the noodles never did cook all the way through, and the whole lasagna cooked inconsistently.  

I would at the very least cook the noodles before trying this again, but I don't feel there's any benefit to using a slow cooker when all the prep time is the same and an oven would cook it faster and do a lot better job.  And with a nice added layer of mozzarella baked into the top, like a lasagna should have.

Delicious! I over cooked it! I have a 6.5 qt Rival crock pot, the instructions said between 4 & 6 hours. I set it at 5 hours and should have checked it at 4 hours but it wasn't bad. I also added and extra 1/2 lb of burger & I highly recommend that extra. Also the other reviews are right, it is a little on the salty side so next time  I 'll use half teaspoon.  Enjoy! 
As a single man I really like these crock  recipes, easy.****

Tried it and was fun to do it up. I wanted Ricotta cheese in my mixture of that vs. Cottage cheese.. more authentic with Ricotta... but I felt I needed to add 2 eggs so it wouldn't be so dry. Was fun to try it

Followed the recipe as written.  Noodles were not cooked and the rest was over cooked.  Waste of time and money.

I made this recipe as is with my son for him to make in his crockpot in the future. I did use meatloaf mix beef .Thought it came out well and had good taste. However I suggest to add water over each layer of noodles. Why double layer of noodles? I found it made the dish heavy and filling. Overall very pleased, simple and tasty. Spray inside of  crockpot  and make sure noddles are all covered with sauce!

First of all, cottage cheese does not belong in any lasagna recipe anywhere!  Ricotta cheese or nothing!  I made this with my homemade sauce and it was awesome to be able to cook it in the crock pot and not have to think about it.  Use a LOT of sauce so it doesn't dry out.

Just like a few of the reviewers did, I modified the recipe. 16 oz Ricotta instead of 12 of Cottage Cheese. Instead of 32 oz of tomato sauce, I used 15 oz tomato sauce and 16 oz of Ragu traditional. Just a dash of salt on the beef instead of the 1 1/2 teaspoons. It actually cooked in just under 4 hours on low. Everyone raved about it. Turned out very good.

1st time making lasagna or pasta of any kind in the slow cooker. My usual lasagna has tons of veggies but I was looking for something easy for my family. I used whole wheat noodles and drained the grease from the meat before adding the onions and garlic. This didnt need any added salts. Use you favourite pasta sauce that will make a huge difference in the flavor outcome. Mone cooked on low for 4 hours and came out better then I thought it would. 
It was nice to able to put this together and then go run some errands and come home to dinner being ready. ..cant so that with an oven lasagna. Not sure if I'll  make as written again. But  I will most likely make my recipe in a slow cooker next time.

Very good tasting but mine came out too dry.  Be prepared to have extra sauce on hand and that will alleviate the dryness of this delicious dish.  I also feel like maybe 3/4 of a box of lasagna noodles is better than the entire box.

I used 16oz ricotta in place of the cottage cheese.  Otherwise, the recipe stayed the same.  It's pretty good lasagna as it is, but it would have been easier to put it in a lasagna pan and pop it in the oven.  Having to break the noodles to fit the oval shape of the slow cooker and then having it cook for a very long time, when the oven would be an hour or less doesn't make a ton of sense to me.  I guess it worked out, because we had it cooking while our city's trick-or-treat was going on and dinner was all ready for us when we were done.  This must be a recipe for when you know you will have to leave the house for exactly the cooking time and no one will be available to pull anything from the oven.  It's weird, that's why I wanted to try.

I decided to make this tonight and it was a big hit! 

I have never made lasagna before and to be honest, I am super lazy so I prefer crockpot lol I cooked it for about 4.5 hours on low and it came out great! I used ricotta instead of cottage and also added more paste and sauce. 

My family loves it, which is saying something because my boyfriend and my son are super picky eaters and they are devouring it.

I made this recipe tonight using jar sauce, omitted the salt, and added some mushrooms. I like to brown the cheese when I'm cooking it in the oven so I'm not sure this would replace using the oven.  The taste was really good though and was enjoyed.

I opted for a tomato, basil and garlic sauce, plus seasoned that additionally.  Just to boost the flavor a little more. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles too, and they cooked perfectly.

This was insanely easy!  My family likes a meatier sauce so I in addition to the ground been I added a pound of Italian sausage and I used a jarred sauce rather than just tomato sauce.  I will be making this again, for sure!

I am reviewing this based on the technique.  This is a great way to make lasagna, especially in the summer!  I made my  sauce using Francesco Rinaldi Marinara sauce (2 jars) and add 1 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground Italian sausage. I don't bother with sauce from scratch when there are other delicious options around!  I used gluten free lasagna noodles (uncooked) and ricotta cheese because who puts cottage cheese in lasagna!  Save 3 lasagna noodles for the top.  I layered as follows sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, repeat.  Top with remaining 3 lasagna noodles, sauce and mozzarella cheese.  Cover and cook on low.  I checked at 4 hours and it appeared done.  Left  it for another hour since we weren't ready to eat.  It was superb after 5 hours.  Serving is not as easy as in a lasagna pan but the taste is the same.  I had some sauce leftover to serve on top but I will use 3 jars next time so there will be plenty!  And there will be a next time!

This recipe is pretty fast & easy to prepare and it's turned out great both times that I've made it. I add a little more cheese, more meat and use the lean turkey and the recipe is very flexible!

This was great, although I thought the oregano was overpowering and, frankly, unnecessary. The only changes I had made were to use a pasta sauce in place of tomato sauce, one onion and 2 tsps minced garlic with the meat, and ricotta in place of the cottage cheese in the cheese mix. (Hint - 5 or 10 seconds in the microwave softens the cheese for easier spreading). Oh and I left out the salt, as recommended.

Next time I will leave out the oregano, and (since my son isn’t a fan of ricotta) use either a simple mix of Parmesan and Mozzarella or (as I usually do) substitute the cheese with a bechamel sauce. 
This is a wonderful, very simple recipe that results in a yummy lasagne!

It was super easy and tasted great, but I think I over cooked it because it was kinda dry.  I like my lasagna saucy and next time I may just make some extra sauce to put on top when serving.  Overall I am sure  I will make it again

It did come out a little to dry so next time I would use more sauce or add some water to sauce. I didn't have a problem with the 6 hours cooked on low but might try 4 next time. This is a good recipe and I would try it again.

The family loved it. I made it as the directions stated except I used Ricotta instead of Cottage cheese. I agree it needs water. I will try that next time. Overall it is definitely worth making again!

I am very picky about lasagna and usually only eat my sisters, BUT when she visited me awhile back and I asked her to make it for me, she was reluctant because it was a really hot day and we don't have A/C. I remembered this recipe and we tried it. We BOTH really, really liked it!!! We didn't cook it as long as it says... didn't need too. I have a crock pot with a lid that fastens down(bake n take)and it works like a pressure cooker and I use it that way all the time. So it was done about an hour sooner than the recipe says.
Thank you for submitting this recipe! It's a keeper for sure!

I was short on time and used one large jar of store bought spaghetti sauce (Prego) with the ground beef. Added about a half jar of water. Used regular (not precooked) lasagna noodles and added one egg to cheese mixture. Cooked on low for 6 hours. The noodles were a tad over cooked so I will back off the cooking time next time. It was a hit!

My family didn't like it too well, maybe it's because we love Stouffer's! I left mine for 6 hrs on low and parts of it burned. It was bland for us and we couldn't detect any cheese, weird, I swear I put it in

My fault. I definitely cooked this for too long (7 hours on low, 1 on warm). Next time I'll stick to 4 hours. I'll also add more mozzarella on top and not mix the cheeses. I will also add spinach and use sauce in a jar or add more seasoning.

It wasn't the best ever and it wasn't the worst. The noodles were a little harder than I'd like, but the kids enjoyed it. I will definitely add more sauce and boil the noodles first next time I make this.

Easy and adaptable recipe. I may have over cooked it because it came out a little dry for my taste. I will make again and cut back on the time or increase the sauce. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage and used canned tomatoes after a whirl in the blended (didn't have tomato sauce on hand). Also used half beef and half sweet Italian sausage for the meat. Thanks for the recipe!

It is an ok base recipe. I've made it twice. First time I didn't alter anything and found the sauce bland and so strong straight tomato. The second time I added herbs to the sauce and flavor was better but still didn't care for it. Both times the recipe was to salty.

This was 5 stars with the addition of various italian spices and so.e red pepper flakes.  I subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese.   Very easy to make and tasted great.  I  highly recommend using a liner in your slow cooker for this recipe.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I like slow cooker recipes because they're usually very quick, saving time in the long run. However, I felt that this recipe had a bit too much prep work; it almost defeated the purpose of the recipe. 

Although it made for a soupier lasagna, it still tasted fine! I was skeptical of using uncooked noodles, but it worked out.

Overall,  it was a bit of work beforehand, but it made for a good supper!

I gave this meal to 8 people,  who all found it was an exceptional pasta dish.  Great depth, nice flavour.  Awesome leftover too.   I did ramp up the amount of beef and garlic. Still,  I really recommend this one.  Also swapped for ricotta,  I did test the pasta to verify cooked state,  no big deal to watch it.

I make with spaghetti sauce, onions, mushrooms, fresh garlic and mix cottage cheese/ricotta together. Mix the sauce with the meat and then layer with the noodles and cheese and put sauce on top.  I throw in oregano and 4  pepperoncini.  I also add an extra layer of noodles on top to keep it more firm.

I made this with ground lamb meat and my mom's home made tomato and eggplant ratatouille sauce.

Lemme tell you, it was heaven. 

We added a couple eggs to the ricotta cheese filling along with  a cupboard full of mediterranean spices. 

Our spinach was fresh, rather than frozen, and we went for three different kinds of cheeses. 

Because we had a gig that night, we set it for 10 hours. It was perfect. Probably would have been perfect at 8 hours, too.  What concerned us were the gluten-free noodles that typically take longer to cook than normal noodles, but they were AMAZING! We now have a go-to recipe that will definitely be repeated. 

Seafood lasagna anyone?!

All in all, we felt as long as we followed the "skeleton" of this recipe, the rest would be easy, so we played around and wound up with a winner!

I have never made Lasagna before in my life because it seemed so daunting. When my daughter asked me to try this recipe in the crock pot, I decided to give it a go. We did switch out the cottage cheese for Ricotta cheese and instead of adding water, I used a jar of "Zoup!" Veggie broth.   I also added one teaspoon of Italian seasoning and minced 2 garlic cloves. I cooked on high for 1.5 hrs and then low for another 4.5 hours. The whole house smelled like heaven while it was cooking. It was absolutely the best Lasagna my family has ever tasted and we will be having it again soon!

I really like the recipe. Partly because I grew up on lasagne made with cottage cheese instead of ricotta. No egg -- which makes me feel better about laying it up early and setting it on a timer.

Replaced the cottage cheese with whole milk Ricotta. So many great recipes I use in a crock pot, but I think Lasagna is not one of them.

It was rather delicious..... I made a few changes... I added Ricotta. Sprinkled a decent amount of crushed red pepper and chopped and seeded a Jalapeno pepper to add a little heat....

I loved this and my kids loved it as well. Perfect recipe. I prepped all the food and put it into the cooker around 11:45pm. When I woke up at 5:30am for work, my house smelled amazing and it was ready for me to bring with me for lunch. I let the kids eat it for dinner and now we are all hooked! Gotta make this one again, most definitely!

This recipe was very tasty and turned out much better than I was expecting.  I followed this recipe to the letter.  The noodles cooked evenly and in my opinion turned out better than when I use the oven.  My only complaint is that it was hard to dish out of the slow cooker and it fell apart on the plate.

This was great!  Like another review said, I too kept thinking, it couldn't possibly be this easy!  I worried the lasagna noodles wouldn't cook well enough, but they did.  My family loved this!  I made a lot more than the recipe called for because I had made a large batch of my own spaghetti sauce, so I made it right up to the top of my crock pot.  I cooked it on high for an hour just because I was worried I had "over packed" my crock pot.  But in the end, I don't think it was necessary.  It was wonderful, and I will definately make this again, and often!

Excellent! Added 1/4 cup of water around the edges in the slow-cooker pot before cooking. Otherwise I cooked this recipe exactly as is. I used the regular wavy edged dry lasagna pasta noodles and did not have to cook them before using them in the recipe (I did not need to use "oven-ready/no-boil" lasagna noodles) and the result was very good.

I really loved it! I watched the video, and took the salt concern to heart, so I added no salt, figuring that there was probably enough in the Parmesan. I did replace about 2/3 of the tomato sauce with a pre-made jar of spaghetti sauce. Everything else was the same! And, it was Delicious!

OH... I made mine GLUTEN-FREE with GLUTEN-FREE PASTA NOODLES! FANTASTIC!!

Not too shabby. Used low sodium spaghetti sauce and it cut down the sodium by about 70%.

This lasagna would have been 5 stars, but I cooked it on low for 4 hours and it scorched. =( The center of the lasagna was salvageable and very tasty.

I make a recipe similar to this.  I use a plastic bag crook pot liner.  When its done, I carefully lift out the bag af lasagna and transfer it to a lower sided dish.  I fold the plastic cover over the lasagna and let it rest.  The lower sided dish is easier to serve out of.  Also use sliced pepperoni so don't have to brown meat.  My recipe uses cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  Marilyn

Awesome! I don't like to change a recipe but I did use ricotta cheese instead and it turned out delicious and filling. It is an easy meal to make on Sunday and have for a satisfying dinner during the week. It smelled so good while it was cooking that I started to pick in the pot! 

I love this recipe and it is now one of my favorites.

This recipe works as suggested,and certainly makes my novice kitchen skills appear more seasoned!It took me 4 hours in my slow cooker,and no burnt pieces either.I used a multi purpose home made tomato sauce off Bing that includes carrots and most of the spices for this recipe [30 minutes to cook].Once it was cooked,I pureed it,added the lean ground beef 'til it was cooked.Left it overnight in the fridge since I didn't want to make this lasagna 'til the following day.Having the main ingredients in ONE pot was excellent,all I had to do was shred the cheese I wanted to use:aged Balderson cheddar.

The sauce was excellent! However ,I fail to see the efficiency of using the crockpot. I will make it again,but put it in a 9x13 pan and bake. Took a lot of time to get it put together .I added some canned tomatoes that I puréed,also added fresh spinach and used Ricotta instead  of cottage cheese.

This was great! I have never used cottage cheese for lasagna, so I also add ricotta cheese to the mixture. It turned out great!

Comes out great.  Not sure of the advantage of the slow-cooker over the oven though.

I followed the recipe, exactly. I really enjoyed the flavour but missed the well-done cheese topping that results from cooking it on the oven. I will use this recipe for a traditionally cooked lasagne, in the future.

I felt that the cheese mixture really did not handle the slow cooking well and lost so much of what makes lasagna delicious.  I will go back to making lasagna in the oven.

Good basic recipe . I would recommend oven ready lasagna and some water and extra sauce to the recipe to insure the noodles are cooked thru. Also low cooking for 6 to 7 hourshould ensure more tenderness.

I make this recipe at least once a month it is so easy and my family loves it. I add a little bit of water around the edges of the inside of the crockpot so that the noodles don't get too dry.

The flavor isn't bad (I omitted the salt) but half of it was burnt. It's definitely not a throw together and leave it dish.  I think if I make it again, it will be while I'm home.  I cooked it for 4 hours and I think it may need more like 3 hours. Still not quite sure what I did wrong since there are so many good reviews on it.

It was easy to make.  First time I'm using a crock pot. I was unable to find tomato sauce so I bought pasta sauce. That was the only substitute. Some noodles where still uncooked so maybe next time I will either add more water to the meat sauce or maybe even used the no bake noodles see if that is better. I will make again

The meat mixture is slightly small, next time i make this, I am going to double the meat mixture. Other than that it was really tasty. Just be sure you get all of the noodles covered with sauce, add water and switch the cottage cheese with ricotta (the small price difference is well worth it).

I really like it but used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Easiest way to make this or any pasta dish is to use "Dreamfield Pasta" (yas they have lasagna noodles) and their manufacturing process yield only 5 carbs per serving (I verified with my hospital dietician). As a diabetic I ouldn't eat pasta until I found this pasta. The only pasta hey don't mke are "egg noodles". I ate 2 helpings and my blood reading didn't move at all.....enjoy!!!

Creamy goodness that melts in your mouth. Unfortunately I made this but fell asleep napping. It stayed in the cooker for two hours too long. Noodles were slightly too softy however still tasted amazing.

I just made this and it was really delicious. Two things i would advise though....I used the regular lasagna noodles. Do not boil them though, use them uncooked and they will cook through the liquids that they are sitting in. Also, after placing everything in the crockpot, pour about a 1/2 - 1 cup water on top. I also added some extra shredded mozzarella on top about 20 minutes before it was done, just to make it a bit more cheesy. I will definitely make it again. One big thing i did find was it wasn't as messy to prepare, so that is a bonus in my eyes.

This actually turned out pretty delish! I added parsley,black pepper,crushed red pepper, oregano, and basil to my meat and chopped up some hot sausage and added that also. I used an extra can of sauce a 12oz I believe. I couldn't find oven ready no boil noodles but cooked this on high for 1 hour and low for 2 and a half and it turned out beautifully will def make again on a cold winter night!!

I made this with the suggested alterations. Mine cooked in 3 hours.  The biggest problem was how to get it out of the crock pot with all of the layers!  LOL  It turned out to be one big goopy mess, but it was still delicious.

This recipe was the best lasagna I have ever had! I did substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese and I added in mushrooms and spinach. It was delicious. I cooked it on high and it was finished in under two hours with the oven ready lasagna noodles. I will be adding this to our weekly dinner menu.

Made this as written, and my husband couldn't get enough! I was nervous about using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, but trust me, it's very good - and I love ricotta! I added sweet Italian sausage to the ground beef. Next time, I will add more sauce and more cheese on top to make it more like a baked lasagna. Thank you for such a quick, easy recipe!

My family loves lasagna, and this is much easier than the old fashion way (I think). I cook with my crock pot at least 4 times a week during the winter months, and this is on our menu quite often.  Plus, it' very east to heat up for leftovers the next day. Serve it with a loaf of garlic bread, you almost have an instant meal!

This lasagna came out GREAT!!I have been cooking in my slow cooker for 20 years. However, I have never tried cooking lasagna. I was a little concerned on how this would come out. I followed the recipe as is but after reading all the comments I did not add the salt. I'm not a big fan of cottage cheese and have never used no-boil noodles. I have a 6 quart All-Clad slow cooker. After 2 1/2 hours I put more mozzarella cheese on the top and put it on warm. I will be definately be making this again.

It may have been that my crockpot cooks at too high of a temperature, but it came out burnt. I am going to try it again with more liquid and a new crockpot.

I was not a huge fan of this recipe. I found it was too salty and the tomato flavor was quite overpowering, even with adding additional vegetables. I will not make this recipe again!

This recipe was really easy and really good, I did read the reviews first and tweaked it a little. For the sauce I used 1 large can of tomato sauce and 1 large can of crushed tomatoes and the tomato paste the recipe recommended. I also seasoned with Italian seasoning. Simmer down for an hour or two if it seems thick add 1/2-1 cup of water. Continue with recipe as noted, I only cooked mine from 12-3 on low. ALl slow cookers vary with heat and length of cooking but check it at the 2 hour mark by sticking a knife through the middle. Mine wasn't soggy or dry. It was perfect

Followed Reviewer Monica's suggestions and subbed diced tomatoes & jar of spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce & paste, also the ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Put in Slow Cooker for 3 hours & it was PERFECT! Added some mushrooms -- heck, you can add any of your own lasagna touches, the recipe is very adaptable.  After 3 hours the Cooker went to "Warm" and I had no problems.  Just make sure all of your noodles are covered with sauce.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Loved it!  6 year old son had it for a snack the next day!  Careful to put the sauce at edge so that noodles don't dry out.  I pureed the cottage cheese for those kids of mine that don't like the curds.

I bought a slow cooker with a timer and slow cooker lining plastic bags.  I made the lasagna with ricotta as it was readily available.  It was a no mess way of doing it.  I notice that the bottom is burnt.  That's the fault of the new higher heat cookers.  Maybe, with the bags, it would be easy enough to check for that by lifting carefully.  I am hapoy with the result and won't ever bother with the mess and heat of the oven again.  I won't cook as long next time.

This was rather simple to make and good.  I added in more vegetables (green bell peppers, onions, and fresh tomatoes).  I used no salt added tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, mixed with spaghetti sauce, but I think the spaghetti sauce made it a little too salty.  So I think maybe next time I'll just do with no salt added tomato paste.  I really liked it that I could just put everything into the slow cooker and not have to keep an eye on the flame.

I agree with others who thought it was too salty.  I added an egg to the cheese mixture and added more Parmesan cheese on top.  It doesn't save much time but it was nice to have it on a hot summer day without heating up a house with no A/C.

What was cooked tasted really nice. However,  the top layer of noodles were completely raw, even though I cook it for the full 6 hours. I won't be doing this again.

For the first time in many years of cooking, I burned a recipe in a slow cooker.  I followed the recipe and think this burning is due to two things, the lack of water in the recipe and the removal of all fat after cooking the meat.  Reviewing others who had similar but different problems I conclude this is not my type of slow cooker recipe.

Thank you for your contribution

My family loved this recipe - I made it just as written although I did add some extra sauce from a can around the edges where noodles were still showing! Next time might make more of the cheese mixture - kids prefer the cottage cheese so it was a big hit!

My whole family loved this and it was super easy. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage and used jarred spaghetti sauce. I also used Italian sausage and ground beef. It was not salty at all as another reviewer had noted.

I've used this recipe as a guideline many time... but just as a guideline.  I add a lot of veggies and herbs and of course, a couple bratwurst.  
I cook this at least once a month for my coworkers on Saturdays and even folks who aren't on the schedule show up to get them a taste!

This was a good recipe. I did not use any of the seasonings. I used 2 packages of spaghetti seasoning instead and 2lbs of hamburger. I also accidentally left out 2 cups of the Mozzerella Cheese, yet it seems to taste fine. I also used Ricotta Cheese instead of Cottage Cheese.

Not too bad!  It was more labor intensive than my regular lasagna, which sort of negates the point of using a crock pot.  Nonetheless, I wanted to try something fun/different in the slow cooker and this fit the bill!  I didn't add the extra salt, and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, based on other recommendations.  Don't know that I'll make this again, but it was fun!

The only thing I changed was using ground turkey instead of beef-turned out perfectly! The kids even ate it, which is amazing!

This turned out dry & not very flavorful.The cheese mixture burned to the side of the crock. May try again by changing a few things, but was very disappointed.

Husband hates GF pasta, I can't eat any wheat pasta. Pasta night had become a memory until this recipe! I par-cooked the gluten free noodles, made the rest of the recipe as written. He liked it! Hooray! Another plus, this is so kid-friendly taste-wise that I'm sure it will please my 4 picky grandsons. When it's just the 2 of us, I'll tweak the sauce to up the spice and complexity. But make no mistake, this is good lasagna. And it's even better the next day!

I made this last night for my picky brother in law.  I used a large bottle (32 oz) of Classico tomato basil sauce, poured it over the beef.  Then used non boil noodles as recommended.  I also used 1 pound ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  It was EXCELLENT and couldn't be easier!  It was light and fluffy and was cooked in 4 hours.  Lasagna held it's shape but was cooked through.  I am recommending this to all my friends, seriously awesome.

OMG; this was so easy and so good.  I worried that the noodles wouldn't cook; no problem.  I would probably add mushrooms next time.

Took longer to prepare than I anticipated, but was tasty.  I wouldn't bother to mix the cheeses together.  Just sprinkle them on separately.  They'll melt together as the lasagna cooks.

I was pleasantly suprised by the ease and good taste of this dish. Stick to designated time however. Thought I could leave it longer at lower temp--ended up burning on edges but still tasted yummy in the middle.  A definite keeper. Thanks!
