I was a little concerned with the reviews about dryness and bland flavor and color.  Neither dryness or color was an issue.  I substituted 1/2 c of melted butter for veg. oil, and put in 3 T of cocoa.  This was a moist, delicious cake, the entire family LOVED it.  Served with my own icing.

Oh yeah - this is the recipe for me, a busy mom who needs shortcuts.  I just made these for a bake sale.  The recipe makes 24+1(for the cook, of course)cupcakes.  They are incredibly moist, dense, and RED.  My modifications:
-white cake mix
-3T of cocoa 
-1 full oz of red coloring

I chose to go with another frosting (Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site) because I prefer more of a dense cream cheese taste and texture.  It's perfect with these cupcakes.

I have never liked red velvet cake until I made this recipe!!!!!  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday because it's his favorite and we both couldn't stop eating it.  I served it to several people and everyone said it was the best they ever had.  I used a more traditional cream cheese frosting so I can't comment on the frosting.
I don't know why it has gotten some reviews that it's bland because mine turned out absolutely moist and delicious.  Wonderful recipe!!!!!!

I have never had any other Red Velvet cake, so I don't know what to compare it to.  But at any rate, THIS IS SOOOO GOOD!  I did make a few changes suggested by other reviewers.  I used 4 tablespoons of cocoa, one tablespoon of vanilla, and two 1oz bottles of the food coloring.  I also used the moist yellow cake mix.  I didn't have time to make the icing, so I used a store bought whipped cream cheese icing.  I put some chopped pecans on top.  It was wonderful!

This is a so-so cake.  Easy enough for a beginner cook, or a person who doesn't have enough time to actually make a traditional Red velvet cake w/ a butter roux frosting

I liked this recipe alot. I used twice the cocoa, twice the red food coloring, and I added vanilla extract. I did not make the icing. I used store bought cream cheese icing.

Red Velvet cake is a family favorite, and this recipe is the easiest I've ever used!  I double up on the cocoa, and use store-bought icing.  We LOVE it!

I am not from the south, nor am I an expert on what a Red Velvet Cake is supposed to take like.  My only experience with Red Velvet Cake is one lushious experience at the Claim Jumper Restaurant which prompted me to look for a recipe.  I am an expert at knowing a delicious dessert when I taste one and this one is amazing!  I added 4 Tbsp Cocoa as other reviewers suggested and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  This was absolutely delicious.  I did not use the frosting.  Instead I made my own cream cheese frosting (1-8oz Cream Cheese, 1 stick margarine, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla).  I made this for the office as cupcakes and also for my mother in law's birthday.  Everyone raved about this and several wanted more than I had.  I plan on making this for my niece's baby shower this weekend and can't wait to devour again.  Thanks so much for a really easy amazing recipe.

Very disappointing.  The only thing similar to a red velvet cake about this cake was the color.

My sister requested a RV cake for her birthday.  I'd never made one before.  I used this recipe and made a few modifications (see below) suggested in various reviews.  Also, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site rather than the one listed with the cake recipe.  The cake was absolutely delicious!!  Everyone loved it!!  * Duncan Hines Golden Yellow Cake Mix * Chocolate Fudge Instant Pudding (instead of vanilla) * 2 oz Red Food Coloring (2 Bottles instead of 1) * 4 Tbsp. Cocoa instead of 1 * Cream Cheese Frosting II Recipe for the Icing (instead of the one with this cake recipe) --> When I added the vanilla, I over-poured by a just a bit on purpose.  This is a keeper!!  Enjoy

This is okay.  It works.  C'mon, this is a cake mix, NOT a "from scratch" cake and as such it shouldn't be compared against the from scratch version.  A little short on flavor perhaps, but then I find "the real thing" to have the same issue (except for the McCormick recipe).  My criticism then, is not so much how it rates compared to a from scratch Red Velvet cake from your childhood you remember your grandma making so much as I don't like the big holes that appeared.  Not attractive. But put this in a pretty cupcake liner (baked as cupcakes about 22 minutes), top with cream cheese frosting, and you've got a legitimately passable Red Velvet Cake.

I gave it a 5 star with these changes:  Add 4 tablespoons cocoa (I followed the suggestions from other bakers on the review) and increase water to 1 1/3 cups, and bake for 37 min.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II instead.  Everyone at my party said it was divine.

Excellent!  Made the following revisions - used 4 Tablespoons cocoa, added 1 teaspoon vanilla - came out a tiny bit dry due to extra cocoa, so I might try adding a tablespoon melted butter in addition to the oil next time.  Used cocoa instead of flour to 'flour' the greased pan - looks much better with a chocolate cake.  Also, don't forget if you use a dark coated pan, you may want to reduce the oven temp.  I used 2 9-inch dark pans and cooked at 335 for 35 minutes.  Also used the cream cheese frosting II from allrecipes.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm rating this cake in the middle of the road. I'll explain. The cake being a box mix, mixed with other ingredients and not home made from scratch was still really good. Not that hard to make or follow to a T. I rate the cake a 5 star. I can't rate the frosting with the cake very well to what I was expecting. While it was also easy to assemble and ease of the ingredients. I didn't like the fact, that it didn't taste like cream cheese frosting with the listed ingredients. My daughter liked it but to say it was cream cheese frosting, I honestly can't. It was a pudding frosting. It didn't have the right style of flavor of a true cream cheese frosting....even with the cream cheese in the frosting. The pudding mix, totally over powered and masked the flavor intended for a red velvet cake with traditional cream cheese frosting. Sorry. It really didn't do justice to my taste buds and I wasn't thoroughly impressed with it. I am sorry I didn't like the frosting flavor at all. I'll make the cake again but not the frosting.

This cake is great.  I did what others suggested and added more cocoa, but no other changes.  I made this twice, once with regular cream cheese frosting and once with the frosting included in the recipe.  Me (and my kids) really did not like the frosting from this recipe.  Its pretty bland...I won't make it again.

Used a different cream cheese frosting but the cake was delicious & moist.  Kept very well in the fridge too.  UPDATE: Do NOT use sugar free pudding mix.  You'll get a completely different cake texture, I actually ended up throwing them away.

YUM! I like to decorate with fresh sliced strawberries.  Ive used the frosting recipe many times for other cakes, changing the pudding flavor to whatever goes with the cake I have.

Perfect for a quick simple red velvet recipe. My friend requested red velvet for her birthday and I didn't have much time to do a whole thing from scratch, found and used this recipe. I was really happy with it.  As suggested I doubled the cocoa powder and doubled the food coloring. It was moist and chocolaty. It was a hit with all my guests.

This cake is great! I have tried a couple of red velvet cake from scratch before. This is very easy & moist! I did use other review's recommendation. (2 oz. red food coloring, chocolate fudge pudding pkg., and 4 Tbsp cocoa) Very easy & moist!  I didn't like the frosting as much though.

At first, I was unimpressed by this cake recipe. I tripled the cocoa powder, as one reviewer suggested, and the result was gorgeously dark red cupcakes (baked for 15 minutes at 350). I also used half butter, half vegetable oil to encourage moistness. Unfortunately, the flavor was very bland. It tasted just like boxed cake mix, except not as good. But my co-workers did like the cake, so I tried it one more time, this time with the original vegetable oil but FOUR tablespoons of cocoa. I really liked how this picked up the flavor a bit for me, and it was more moist this way.

My cake turned out dry and a weird texture. I don't know if I did something wrong or what. I made my grandma's recipe and used it instead. It tasted alright but I needed it to be moister.  Thanks I don't know why it turned out dry.

very good recipe. used recipe to make a bundt cake. but instead of the recipe's frosting, i glazed it with the German Chocolate Cake Frosting II. i didn't add any coconut or pecans to the frosting. however i did sprinkle a little coconut flakes on top. it was delicious.

I love red velvet cake and this was my first time making it. It turned out awesome!! I didnt have the instant pudding mix so I used one of those individual chocolate pudding cups and it still turned out great. Used store bought cream cheese frosting, mmmmm cant wait to make again!!

Good cake with minor modifications. Added 4 T cocoa and 1 T vanilla. Also frosted with cream cheese frosting II (from this site). Was perfect.

I used butter instead and it turned out great!  Everyone loved this one.  I would use regular buttercream frosting next time.

I made this cake and used my own cream cheese frosting recipe.  It was ok, but probably not something I'd make again.  I ended up using three times the cocoa powder and some vanilla extract, after the batter didn't taste even remotely like chocolate.  The cake was moist and light, but it just tasted like something was missing...

I think this is as close to a true red velvet cake as you can get while using a boxed cake mix.  I consider myself a RV connoisseur but a novice cake baker so the idea of making a RV cake from scratch seemed daunting.  I followed this recipe exactly except for using 3 T of cocoa powder and a different icing recipe as suggested by other reviewers.  This cake was fabulous!  Everyone who tasted it loved it and it was moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again!

My first Red Velvet cake and it was a HUGE hit! My family loved it. I read the reviews and added 3 T of cocoa and 2 tubes of red food coloring, and the color and taste was amazing! I made heart shaped cupcakes for Valentine's Day and it was LOVE all around! Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!!!

Easy to make.  I used white cake instead of yellow, and also doubled the cocoa and used 2oz of red food coloring.  The cake came out more of a pink color than red but still looked nice.  Made tons of icing!  Overall tasty!

I'm no Red Velvet cake expert, but I thought this was a good cake.  I used a whole bottle of red food coloring (the tiny ones that come in a set) and it wasn't enough to get a rich red color-- more a brown red, FYI.

If you've ever had a real red velvet cake you will be disappointed with this recipe. Adding food coloring does not make any cake become red velvet. I did make the cake and it was a good, but it was not a red velvet.

Tasty cake and easy to make, but not at all like traditional red velvet. This cake was moist and fluffy, whereas red velvet is supposed to be dense.  Still a good cake, but I agree that the only thing this cake has in common with red velvet is the color

These were good. Let me clarify, the cake was fine. The icing on the other hand was a huge flop and I only barely saved it with some additions.   I should have taken heed of the thinly-veiled warnings when everyone who gave it 5 stars used their own frosting recipe.   If you want to basically top the cupcake with pudding, then by all meals follow the recipe.

This cake was very moist. I made changes as the others suggested. I added 4tbsp of cocoa, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/3 cup of reduced fat olive oil mayo. I made icing with a tub of whip cream, sugar, and 8oz of cream cheese.

I gave 4 because of the changes.  I used the oil suggestion and half the red.  The cake was moist and perfect.  Next time I will try beet juice.  I used Cream cheese frosting II from this sight with recomendations.  I would like to make three smaller layers next time and double the frosting.  The only complaint was more frosting.  It was eaten up quick.

Great and easy recipe for a novice baker such as myself. The cake was moist and was a hit with everyone on Thanksgiving. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 4 tbps of cocoa powder and tad bit more food coloring.  I used store bought cream cheese icing and whipped it up (using a mixer) with a few drops of vanilla extract. Will definitely make again.

Yes, I have some guilt saying I made a red velvet cake when a cake mix was involved, but my wife loved it.  Red velvet has been her favorite her whole life.  When she tried the first bite, she did a little dance.  That, my friends, equals five stars in my book.

GREAT RECIPE!! it was my first time making a red velvet cake, and now me and my family are huge fans! I upped the cocoa powder to 4T as others suggested, which gave it the perfect combination of chocolate and vanilla. The cake was moist and looked beautiful! TIP: for the frosting, make sure that the cream cheese is at room temperature and it should be beaten before added the milk, otherwise, there will be lumps, which are stubborn to get out. The frosting did have a slightly yellow hue because of the pudding, but it tasted delicious--fingerlickin good!!

This recipe has been a hit with my friends!  It is a moist, easy to make, and delicious cake and icing!  I add a little extra cocoa, but that's it.  Amazing cake! If you are expecting the "typical" dense, and slightly bitter red velvet cake, this isn't the way to go, but for a delicious and similar alternative, try this recipe!

Having never made an RV cake I found this recipe to be easy and very tasteful. However as far as I could find, the pudding only comes in 1 and 1 1/2 ounce sizes. I used one of the 1 1/2 oz containers for the cake and found the recipe to be fine. However the frosting left a great deal to be desired. Next time I will use a different recipe for the frosting. BTW, I used sugar-free instant pudding and reduced sugar cake mix for a very low sugar cake.

I used this recipe to make red velvet cupcakes.  I made the cream cheese frosting from scratch from a recipe I also found on allrecipes.com.  My only suggestion is to use choclate pudding mix instead of vanilla.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe that I've used over and over again!

We thought this cake was okay.  We were disapointed with the frosting.  It just tasted like instant pudding and Cool Whip.  I will stick to the traditional cream cheese frosting when making a red velvet cake.

Delicious, moist cake! I used two 9" round pans and got two huge layers of cake.  My husband couldn't stop raving about this cake.  I used my own icing recipe.  The only thing I didn't like about this cake is that it turned out more orange than red - even after using all the red food coloring I had.  This is definitely a keeper though!

The cake was very moist and dense. The second time I made it I doubled the cocoa. But I had trouble with the frosting. It tasted good, but I made the recipe twice and boh times the frosting had little lumps in it. I tried creaming the cream cheese and instant pudding together before I added the milk but it didn't seem to help. I did, however, like the flavour.

I made this cake yesterday based on the reviews.  The cake is pretty (nice coloring) and quite moist, but too dense. Also, I found the cake to be a little bland (not the traditional Southern Red Velvet cake taste).  I made 2 9" layers and split the layers.  Very easy to make.

Thanks for this recipe!  I have always loved red velvet but most recipes I've used always turn out dry.  I did not have a yellow cake mix the first time I used this so I substituted a french vanilla cake mix and it turned out great.  My brother-in-law even said that it was "almost as good" as his great-aunt's (she was known as the great cook in the family!!!)  Thanks again for sharing this recipe!

This isn't a bad cake but it isn't much of a red velvet cake. To me it tasted more like a red yellow cake, I could still taste the yellow cake mix. I made it with my daughter and it was moist and pretty but it didn't taste like red velvet to me it just looked like one. I would reccomend trying a chocolate/ devils food cake mix if you want to use a cake mix to make a red velvet cake or even just adding some extras to a red velvet mix.

This was a great recipe.  I increased the cocoa to 2 tablespoons, and used a basic cream cheese frosting in lieu of the one in the recipe.

This recipe was just like my Mama used to make.  Let me tell you, it was really good.  I did do something unheard of with Red Velvet and that is add coconut to the icing.... even better!

I made this cake for the first time for an office birthday.  I decided to substitute the changes suggested, and this cake was a huge hit.  There was only enough cake left for the birthday boss to take home for himself for later.  Thank you for this great and easy recipe!

I'm actually only keeping this recipe for the icing portion.  It was so simple but so perfect.  The cake itself was not to my liking but the shower for which I made it seemed to like it, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3.  Maybe I just don't like red velvet cake.

I know this isn't exactly "REAL" red velvet cake...but it tastes really, really, really, really, really, really, ridiculously good.  So, really...who cares?  Make it, I say.  (Like other reviewers, I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe from this site.)

This cake was excellent. I got rave reviews from everyone at work. I wanted to take credit for the recipe but when everyone wanted the recipe I had to give it up. I increased the cocoa to 3 tablespoons as recommended. Super moist. Thanks for recipe.

Great cake after the recommended changes, FABULOUS icing.    For those who didn't like the icing my guess is they were looking for the traditional cream cheese frosting.  I don't care for traditional cream cheese frosting and I LOVED this.  It was lighter and fluffier & had a taste somewhere b/twn the cream cheese and the pudding.  I usually scrape any icing off my cake and just eat the cake.  This was one where I could have eaten just the frosting.  I will use this frosting recipe over and over!  I took the advice of others and doubled the red food coloring, used chocolate pudding for the vanilla in the cake, used 4 Tbsp cocoa powder and used melted butter instead of veggie oil.  It tasted great - equivalent to a 4 star in my book, but since there were so many changes made I took a star off.  I wish I could have given it a 3.5 though because I was wild for the frosting.

I made this cake for my mother in laws birthday and it was a BIG hit; there is not a piece left. The one thing I changed was the frosting. I used a different frosting listed on this website. This cake was SUPER moist and had just enough chocolate flavor.  This recipe now has a permanent home in my recipe box.

I made this recipe for a Christmas dessert, and it worked pretty well. The cake, itself, was pretty tasty. It was quite moist once it was baked.  I did have issues with the batter being extremely thick, which meant that it didn't get mixed as well as it should have. I ended up with several white  spots throughout my cake. My family thought it was purposeful, but it would have been better if the dough wasn't as thick.

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and everyone said the cakes was really moist.  It wasn't too light but this wasn't the typical decadent red velvet cake but it's just as good.  The only differences to my recipe was to use 2 oz of red food coloring, 4 TBLSP of cocoa powder, and I used a premade whipped cream cheese frosting.  I was going to make a different frosting from this website but I needed to save time.  Oh, and make sure to completely cool the cake for an hour before you put the frosting.  Next time I will make frosting myself for much better results, if possible.

Awesome.  I made a few subsitutions that worked in my favor.  I used white cake mix rather than yellow, white chocolate pudding rather than vanilla, reduced the cocoa powder to 1 teaspoon, and substituted the veggie oil for softened butter.

I should have known better than to try to skip steps with the cake mix in this recipe.  I followed this recipe to the letter, other than tripling the cocoa, and it was completely tasteless.   Neither the flavor nor texture were like true red velvet cake.  I liked the fluffier version of cream cheese frosting, but my family didn't. If I were to ever try this again, I would definitely use chocolate pudding in the cake instead of vanilla.  But I think I'd be better off with a from-scratch recipe, no cake mix involved.

I made these for my daughter's birthday and they were very good.  I added one extra tbs of cocoa powder and 1 tsp vanilla since some of the others had mentioned a lack of flavor.  They were light, moist and delicious.  The icing was good too and not too sweet.

Needed a quick red cake, for my vampire themed party.  I wanted to try the other recipe from scratch, but I didn't have time to do a test batch, so I just went with this one.  I ended up making cupcakes they turned out great!  Everybody loved them.  This is yet another great  "doctored" cake mix on this site!!!

This cake was nice and easy to make!  I did use another frosting mix (1 8 oz package of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, and 1 tsp vanilla extract).

Keeping in mind that this recipe is made from a box cake, it's pretty good.  It's dense and flavorful.  It still has that box cake/chemical flavor that you CANNOT mask no matter how hard you try - so if you accept that this is a box cake recipe, you will be happy with the results.

I definitely agree that this recipe needs more cocoa powder.  I knew the reviews were saying to add 4 tbsp. but I was too afraid to add that much, so I added 2 tbsp. and I wish I would have been braver because 2 was not enough.  I also agree with the reviews that this is not the traditional red velvet cake, so if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. However, it is an easy recipe and is a great tasting cake.  I did not use this frosting recipe.

I am the kind of person who judges a cake by its frosting, and eats the frosting first. That is why I started to give this 3 stars, but decided to hold back. If you are looking for a classic Red Velvet Cake, this is not the recipe without some significant changes (specifically the frosting).  However, if you are looking for something refreshing and tasty, but not specifically Red Velvet, give this a try as is.  I started giving this 3 stars, because when I was searching for Red Velvet Cake, that was what I was craving... Although this was tasty without any changes, my less than 5-star rating is based primarily on the title, as it sets oneself up for disappointment to call this Red Velvet Cake. This cake+frosting was good, but not at all my experience with a classic "Red Velvet" Cake.   That said, I have come back to this recipe for the cake portion alone. If you are looking for an easy RVC recipe, I would recommend making the cake as directed, but add FOUR tablespoons of cocoa instead of 1. Then, use any of the traditional cream cheese frosting recipes on this site that call for butter, powdered sugar, and cream cheese. The cake portion of this recipe, when you add more cocoa, is a great and easy way to make the base for Red Velvet Cake. However, I will not be making the frosting again unless I am craving something lighter and less rich than classic RVC. Thank you for the recipe!

I had never made red velvet before, but it is tradition for his mom to make him one on his birthday.  So this year I made it using this recipe and it was a total success!  I substituted the choclate pudding in the cake and upped the cocoa as suggested.  The only minor disappointment was the frosting.  I wish I had listened to other reviewers, so next time I will change it up.

Made this cake for the first time last night.  I used two cake pans and trimmed down the cooking time, and made homemade cream cheese icing (modified my Italian Cream Cake frosting recipe).  The cake was incredibly moist (beat the socks off of ANYTHING we ever tried at Sprinkles!), and had the most PERFECT flavor-- and did I mention "MOIST"?!  One last thing... I would refrigerate overnight before eating, to give the icing time to settle.   This is the best red velvet cake I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a LOT of red velvet.  :)  Awesome recipe, thank you so much!

I got to do cake honors for my sister-in-laws recent birthday get-together.  I should mention she considers herself quite the connoisseur & red velvet is her favorite.  She & her mother declared this the "best red velvet cake they'd ever had". I have to admit, I made this as a 2nd choice, after the 'real deal' flopped, turning out dry & heavy.  I couldn't believe how moist, delicious & simple this was.  (I used Moist Supreme Golden Butter for the mix/ increased cocoa to 3 Tbsp.) What a winner!

We did enjoy the cake (but only after we abandoned the idea that it was the same kind of red velvet cake that we're used to), but not the frosting.  We all much prefer the heavier, more traditional cream cheese frosting.  I'll make it again, but substitute the other frosting.

The cake was delicious and very moist.  I really liked the frosting (light and not too sweet), but my husband did not.  He likes the traditional frosting for this cake.

This is different from the red velvet cake my great-grandmother used to make with a very thick, sweet cream cheese frosting. While that is still my favorite, I'm giving this 5 stars, because my daughter loves this cake and always requests it. She doesn't usually eat icing, but loves this lighter, fluffier frosting. So you just need to know that up front, so you can decide if you want to try this or use a heavier, more traditional frosting.

Great recipe!  I've never made a RV cake, and this one came out great.  Very moist, and fluffy.  I made mini and regular sized cupcakes, and used a store bought cream cheese frosting instead of the one in this recipe (needed to save some time).  These will be perfect for a vampire themed party I am hosting.

Wow! This cake recipe is possible the first dessert I've ever made that my whole family loved. With a few revisions, this cake came out unbelievably moist: 4 TB cocoa powder, 5/6 cup oil, and 1 1/4 cup water. With 1 full ounce of red food coloring (4 of those mini dropper bottles or 1 large glass bottle) the cake came out a lovely rich dark red color.  I went with Cream Cheese Frosting II which came out delicious as well.

I searched your files for a special holiday cake and settled on this one.  It was spectacular!  I made a two layer cake and split the layers so I had four.  The first time I made it the frosting was a bit skimpy so the next time I used 12 oz. of cool whip and it was perfect.  My whole family thought it was the best cake they had ever eaten.  Mrs. McAl

This cake is wonderful.  You look great and it's something your friends and family will love.  I like it best if you cook the cake in two 8x10 pans and then split the cakes making four layers.  Then having the frosting in every layer.  It is a huge hit. And looks beautiful.

I added a bit of extra cocoa and slightly reduced the red food color and this came out great!  I was a bit nervous it would be dry as it stuck a bit to the pan.  I was able to remove it without any damage.  I would recommend letting the cream cheese come to room temp before mixing for the frosting.  I think white cake mix would work just as well as the yellow.   Everyone loved it!

Oh my goodness so delicious.  Easy and moist.  I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa and only  a few drops of red food coloring.  It was too brown to look like red velvet cake but it sure did taste like it.  I made my own cream cheese frosting.  Even my husband that doesn't like cake devoured it.

Very easy moist cake.  I followed exact instructions.  Loved the light (not too sweet) icing.  Next time I am going to add a little more cocoa for I would have liked a little more chocolate flavor.

I  used many of the other reviewer‘s suggestions… White cake mix, 1 ounce red food coloring, 4 tablespoons cocoa , 1 teaspoon vanilla And about 1 1/4 cups water. I made mine with 3. 9 inch round pans and I used a basic cream cheese Frosting recipe. It was absolutely delicious! Got rave reviews at the birthday party that I furnished it for.

As written, I don't think this recipe is anything special. Kind of bland. However,  it was very moist, so the next time I made it I made a few adjustments as recommended by other reviewers, and ended up with my family's new favorite chocolate cake recipe. Yes, chocolate cake, not red velvet! I didn't have red food coloring and I took the suggestion of adding 4 TBSP of cocoa powder (I happened to have Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder on hand, highly recommend!) as well as trading out vanilla pudding for chocolate pudding. Added a dash of vanilla extract to the mixture and I ended up with a great, moist chocolate cupcake. To prevent too many lumps and clumps, I mix together my dry ingredients and whisk well, then I add together my wet ingredients and mix well, then put it all together and try to mix it before the pudding starts to do its thing and gets very thick. These bake up very quickly as cupcakes, by the way. Check early and often; I make 12 huge cupcakes from the recipe, and they are done at 350 degrees after about 17-19 minutes.

I made this for a recent birthday. I did substitute butter for the vegetable oil, added 4 tablespoons of cocoa, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1-1/3 c. water. It was a HUGE success! Very light and airy. Unfortunately, we were not fans of the frosting. Thank you for a recipe we will repeat with the substitutions suggested by others. Thanks for those to all who reviewed this recipe.

This is my family’s favorite recipe for birthday cakes! We change out the pudding flavors to suit each person’s taste.. The best frosting recipe on the web is right here! Fluffy, not too sweet. I’ve used whole milk in the cake recipe a few times but you don’t need it. Cake is super moist, tender and takes ingredient changes very well. Thank you for this great recipe!

It was marvelous!! 
Really had the Red Velvet flavor.
I did make mine with the some of the suggestions made by TAMSHEROWNBOSS:

Exchange 1/2 cup of the oil for melted butter and added 3 TBSP total cocoa. The pudding I used was "cheesecake" flavor.
The cake was super moist and exactly right.

THANK YOU :) ???

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty, easy to do, and my family liked it overall. The only thing I did different was add mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and it was just the little something this recipe needed :] I'll be making it again.

This cake was good, but it's NOT a TRUE Red Velvet Cake. Unfortunately I was looking for an easy way to make it and was disappointed with the outcome. However, it managed to disappear!

This got rave reviews last Christmas!  People even asked for the recipe!  It is an easy, really foolproof recipe to have.  I did take other reviewes' advice and double the cocoa powder, and I liked the mellow chocolatey flavor the cake had.  People also raved about the frosting, which is a nice, not too sweet topping for the cake.  Highly recommeneded recipe!

Didn't like this recipe much. Sure, it was easy enough but, it's very bland. I will for sure try another recipe next time I want to make red velvet cake.

Yum. The cake was so good. I followed others suggestions and added 4tbs of coco and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. This made a moist and tasty chocolate cake. I kept the food coloring at what the recipe called for and it was very red.  I made the mistake of making the frosting as directed and I should have used a traditional cream cheese frosting. I will make this again.

I recently made a different red  velvet cake recipe from scratch.  I was painstakingly careful to follow it to the letter.  The cake was heavy, dry and lacked flavor.  So, I decided to try this.  While I realize it's cutting corners, it came out moist, full of flavor and bright red.  I made cupcakes for a holiday family gathering for the kids.  Decorated them with green frosting and holiday sprinkles.  They rose up beautifully with a nice level cap on top and they are delicious!  I will be making these again!!!  Thanks to Mary for the great recipe!

It's a good cupcake, not red velvet-y at all, and not by any means a GREAT cupcake... I did another batch adding 2 cups of sour cream and that helped, but will keep looking for a red velvet recipe.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and it was great.  The icing... not so much.  Odd and not a typical cream cheese flavor.  Very puddingy.  The cake was great though!

This was excellent.  The only change I made was to use 4 tablespoons of Cocoa and I am glad that did.  The cake had the perfect chocolate flavor and was a big hit with everyone at my sons birthday party.  My father in law ate three pieces!  A did use the frosting recipe given and it was awsome.

Pretty decent.  I made this with a gluten free cake mix for a friend.  I also added more cocoa as suggested by others.  It turned out great with the GF mix, but it was very dark.  That may be due to using Special Dark powder, but I'm not entirely sure.  Pretty tasty regardless.

I used this recipe to make cake balls. I didn't have time to make a cake from scratch and refused to use a box red velvet cake mix so this was a good middle ground. I used another cream cheese frosting from this site but I know the cake turned out great. I will use this recipe next time I have to make red velvet cake balls. Thank you

This was a first in making Red Velvet Cake and it turned out beautifully! My daughter has been bugging me to make this for the past two years and because I really don't like baking, my younger daughter did the honors of making it for me. I so wish I had stepped in to read the reviews only because I felt it could have used more cocoa powder. No matter, it was still so good and the frosting was delicious! So light and fluffy and it certainly made enough for even three layers. Such a pretty cake and thank you so much Mary!!

Very good! I used sugar-free pudding mix (bought it out of habit), which may have thrown off the proportions, but it was still very good! Didn't make the frosting in the recipe- used Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Added 3 tbsp of cocoa powder as per other reviews. I underestimated how much food coloring is needed to get it really red- mine wasn't as bright as it should've been.

Great recipe for the red velvet part...i just used the standard cream cheese frosting though.  I did like most others and used 4tbs cocoa and 2 oz red food coloring.  Could have used maybe a tiny bit more cocoa, but im not complaining.  They were fluffy, moist, and red!  Ill definitely be making these in the future.  I did cupcakes and this recipe made exactly 24.

Thanks for a great recipe! This was very yummy and moist. Very beautiful color too! I used my own cream cheese frosting, added vanilla, and I used the pudding I had on hand which happened to be mini chocolate chip vanilla pudding. I definitely will use this recipe again. I want to experiment with adding a cherry jam layer, or maybe adding chocolate chips to the cake and using chocolate frosting. Definitely would be pretty with fresh raspberries or cherries! Remember to dust pans with cocoa instead of flour.

Awesome cake. I didnt make the cream cheese frosting I just bought it. Much to my suprise this beat of the standing family favorite cake batter even when side by together. I did use french vanilla cake mix because its what I had on hand. It was very moist and delicious.

I made this recipe for my brothers birthday, he's never had red velvet and neither have I, but we both thought it was great! it was very moist and though I do agree it was missing something in flavor, it paired very well with the store bought frosting.  I actually doubled this recipe, and since one reviewer said it tasted better with chocolate pudding mix, I used half vanilla, and half chocolate. and like everyone suggested, doubled up on cocoa and added some vanilla extract! I suppose if you prefer one flavor over the other, then add more of that flavor, otherwise neither of them will stand out that much. [again, still good!]

This cake was such a hit with my family! We loved it! I didn't have a lot of time so instead of making the frosting from scratch I just bought some Betty Crocker Cream Cheese frosting... that was a mistake! It's as powerfully sugary as the regular stuff. The cake is wonderfully rich enough on its own, I think next time I might go with a whipped cream frosting instead.

The flavor of this cake was really good, but it wasn't very pretty.  I followed the recipe exactly but the cake sunk in while it was cooling, and there was a short layer at the bottom of the cake that was kind of gummy.  I must have done something wrong....

I'm only giving 4 stars because I was not the biggest fan of the frosting and think the prepackaged whipped cream cheese frosting in the store is better.

This was a good recipe. It was moist and everyone loved it. I didnt have any cocoa, yet it still came out great and i am going off what everyone said about it. Despite me telling everyone i didnt add the cocoa to the recipe. They truly enjoyed it. I would recommend this recipe. I am going to make this cake tonight I found the cocoa.

This is a quick and delicious solution to prepare a very special dessert that doesn't require special ingredients or attention for all occasions.  For real chocoholics, I shave bittersweet chocolate over the top of the frosting.

I used "Duncan Hines" brand yellow cake mix; "Jello" brand instant pudding mix; "cool whip" whipped topping.  Works every time for me.  Never fail.  This recipe is great!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!I reluctantly tried this new recipe for my father-in-law's birthday and the response was unanimous-hands down the best, not only red velvet, but the best cake that they had ever had PERIOD! Moist was an understatement, and the icing was perfectly light, fluffy, not too rich and overpowering, yet still nice and cheesy.
