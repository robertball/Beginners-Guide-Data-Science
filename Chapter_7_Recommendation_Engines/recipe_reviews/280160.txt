I agree with those that say saturating the bread with the entire mixture will result in a soggy mess. I dipped each slice of bread into the egg mixture and then poured about 1 1/2 cups over the bread in the casserole dish. I then baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes checked it and added 10 minutes after that. That turned out perfect.

Fabulous ingredients but the end result was a soggy ... not good texture. It was a perfect crusty on the outside though. It’s sad but probably won’t repeat.

We love it and you can add any fruit and flavor like nutmeg. But the bottom slices were very moist not sure if I like that.

It was just ok for my family. It looked pretty, but it just wasn’t as good as regular French toast.

This was so soggy. Kids, husband and self couldn’t eat it.  It was a waste of ingredients. So sad.  I tried to take individual pieces and fry them on a pan but it was unsalvageable. Don’t waste your time and money on this one.  I wanted to love it but it was worse than I expected even with other reviews warning how soggy it is.  More baking time did not help either.

This recipe is like many of the reviews said, a soggy mess!  It needs to be made in bigger pan where the liquid has a chance to bake and absorb equally on the bread.   As is, the top is too crispy and the bottom is too soggy. It was my first time trying something like this with strawberry syrup and that made this recipe eatable.

I loved irt! I would put in more strawberries next time and I didn't put the confectioner's sugar on top. I will do that next time.

Just FYI for people complaining of soggyness... it is best to let it sit overnight in the fridge so all the liquid can soak into the bread...30 mins is not nearly enough time...thats why there is so much liquid. Just make it right before bed then pop in over in the morning!

I didn't put in strawberries. It was really good, but could use a bit more almond extract. I also sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar before I baked it. It made enough for at least one more meal!

Excellent! Everybody loved it and wants it again. A little healthier w/o the sugar and heavy cream.

As with most who have made this, it was soggy. With that much liquid there is no way to cook this enough without frying the tops.  I liked the idea but can’t do the soggy.  If someone knows how to avoid this outcome I would be interested in making it again.

My family loved it! I used 12 slices of cinnamon raisin bread and one less egg, less sugar and it came out amazing!

I followed the instructions but put it in the refrigerator overnight. Then baked it the next morning for brunch with bacon, delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe in half because l only wanted it for two. Instead of almond extract, I used vanilla extract. It was very good and intend to use the entire recipe when I have guest.

I thought this was excellent!  I always change recipes at least a little.  For this one, I added some cream cheese cut into cubes, and didn’t add the almond extract because I didn’t have any.  But I think that would have been a great addition.  Loved the taste of the lemon zest!  We are this with some maple syrup and it was really delicious!

It was OK, it took a lot of time and effort.  The house was really hot after using the oven.  I tried it in the oven and in a pan too and they tasted alike,  just use a pan. The end result was the same.  It was good don't get me wrong, but it was TOO much effort!
