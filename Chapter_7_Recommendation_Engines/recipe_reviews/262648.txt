I also cut the butter in half, for health reasons.  I will cut it slightly further, next time.  The butter adds a lovely flavour to the dish, as did the thyme.  I have been looking for a good sweet potato fries recipe for a long time.  No longer - this is even better way to eat this veg!!

I can tell you, this recipe is a keeper.  I had to cut down the butter by half because it was just too much, otherwise, it was delicious.
I recently bought some Indian sweet potatoes so I used those.  Their flesh is not orange but they are sweet and delicious.
Next time, I think I will cut down the amount of butter again.  It doesn't add anything to the dish other than fat and calories, and really, who wants that? ??
Overall, this is a hit and I think you will enjoy this one!
