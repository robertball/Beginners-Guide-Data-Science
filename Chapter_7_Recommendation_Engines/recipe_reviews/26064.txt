I've made this recipe a few times now. I've found that a few changes really make this better.

Use the pudding cake mix. 
Use 2 8oz packages of cream cheese (the whipped cream cheese was MUCH easier to work with)
3 eggs
4 cups of sugar

With those changes, the topping was much creamier, and the pudding based cake mix kept the bottom layer very moist, held together over all a lot better.

Also, found that if you let this cool and settle 12-24 hours before presentation, it's just that much better. 

A very good recipe!! Always gets compliments and never a bite left.

I did not like these bars at all.  But, some people who tried them really liked them.  The bars are not at all like cheesecake, so the name is very misleading.  I thought they tasted like extremely sweet cream cheese frosting on a crust.  Too much sugar and not enough cream cheese.

My husband is not a dessert person and rarely eats sweets, but he loved this.  He tells his friends that I try new recipes but don't make them often enough.  My teenage children loved it also.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a good dessert but not what I was expecting.  I thought it would be more like cheesecake.

Say no to the butter flavored shortening called for, some things simply have to have butter to taste right, and this recipe is one of them. This is the same recipe as "Gooey Butter Cake" except says use shortening instead of butter and that does the recipe no favors. Warning, it is very sweet so don't even think of trying this if you don't enjoy sweet desserts. I also think the "cheesecake" reference in the recipe name isn't all that accurate. The taste is kind of indescribable :)

I was really looking forward to this recipe because it sounds just great.  Sadly, mine came out woefully undercooked and when I tried to cook it longer the top became too brown. The cake part was thick and coarse. I will try again because it just sounds so appealing and I want it to work but I felt like something was wrong with the ratios for this to turn out so disappointing.

This is by far the best dessert I have ever made!!!Anytime I make them to take somewhere I always take along a few copies of the recipe because I always get asked for it. Everyone in my family loves them, I'm always asked to bring them to any gathering that we have. Be careful though, their addicting.

This is an excellent twist on traditional cheesecake.  I used butter instead of shortening and white cake mix instead of yellow.  It turned out great and I've already committed to making it again for Easter lunch next weekend.

These are "all right" according to the bf.  I think they are a bit sweet, and I eliminated 1/2  a cup of the sugar.  Bf says I can make it again, but we'll see.  I didn't think it had a lot of flavor for the amount of ingredients.  Seems to need something, although I don't know what. I tried making it in an 8x8 pan but I don't recommend it.  I forgot about the cake part . . . .it rises.  Oops.  Anyway, it went a bit high over the pan.  So if you make it, either halve the recipe or put it in a 9x13 pan as written.  Thanks for sharing.

Not as cheesy tasting as I would like and I think I under-baked it because it was soupy. I added lemon juice and zest for added flavor. I don't think I would make it again.

Not what I was looking for, but it was worth a shot.  Super, super sweet.  Too much for our tastes.
