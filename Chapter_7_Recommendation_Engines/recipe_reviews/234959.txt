I made several changes to the recipe to add more flavor... I precooked the flesh kale, add sweet dill pepper and saut√©ed the pepper and onions before adding them to the dish...  I also topped with more cheese and cooked for another 5 minutes before serving.  My family loved it...  by the way there was no need to add salt and pepper the soup added enough flavor...

It was okay. Definitely not amazing. Mine wasn't done in 45 mins or even 50 mins. I ended up turning up the heat to 400 and cooking it another 15 mins for it to be bubbling. There was a grease in it. I think that was my fault though I used low fat yogurt instead of non fat. It truly must make a different. But the taste itself was very bland. As a vegetarian, I am always looking for tasty new recipes and this one wasn't it.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this as a vegetarian entree.  We paired it with toasted baguette after reading several reviews suggesting that it would make a good dip, although the baguette definitely wasn't necessary. We chopped the casserole up for our 10 month old too, and he loved it. Definitely recommend cooking the onion and kale ahead of time--it would never fit in a baking dish otherwise. I sauteed the onion and kale together using a tablespoon of olive oil, then mixed everything and baked as the recipe calls for.

I made this as a side dish for our New Years Day family gathering. I made a couple of changes simply because I had different ingredients on hand. I used plain Greek yogurt and shredded mozzarella. This dish was a hit with my family and the perfect combination of flavors to go with our pork & kraut. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because even though I used 3 apples (2 red, 1 green) the general consensus at my table was that it could use even more apples. Also, I cooked it at 400 because I had scalloped potatoes in at the same time. Even with the increased temp it needed over an hour to reach a bubbling point. Otherwise, it was delish and will definitely be made again.

Wow - this is divine!  It's a delicious, rich combination of flavors.  Very savory, with a hint of sweet/tart from the apples.  And SO EASY & quick!  Next time I will try leaving the skin on the apples for additional nutrition & color.    I agree with OneSpunCookie that this would make an excellent warm dip.  I served it over brown rice.

Before I popped it in the oven I thought it might be too dry to serve over rice, but the apples release a lot of moisture.  Thank you so much for posting!

This is delicious! I served it over brown rice, but it would be great alone or as a dip I'm sure. Thanks for sharing! (Small changes: precooked the kale and onions for a few minutes, and made a cream of soup rather than using a canned one.)

Great recipe, a keeper for me.  I used it as a dip and served with pita chips and tortillia chips.  Didn't have any apples ir eggs on hand.  I will try it with the apple next time.  As a dip I don't think it even needed an egg.   I will try it as a side dish as well.  Thanks!!

This was easy and pretty good. However, a 9x9 baking day was WAAAAAY too small. I ended up transferring everything to a 9x13, which worked much better. For my tastes, I though the finished product was a bit too creamy; it needed something to cut that creaminess. It would have been great as a dip, though. Overall, pretty good.

This wasn't too bad!  I think if you added sun dried tomatoes and served it over rice or chicken it would be much better.  We served it over breaded chicken and it was pretty good!  I only give it a 3 star cause it needs a little tweaking and my hubby and kids didn't care for it, but I thought it wasn't bad!

Super easy. I had vegetarian guests and served this as a side. All the guests not just the vegetarians raved about it.
