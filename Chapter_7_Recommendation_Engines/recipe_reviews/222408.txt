I really liked these. I added most of the bacon inside and left a few for the top to decorate the plate. Really rich. Tasted great warm.. hope they taste good tomorrow as well

Hmmm...i don't know...I'm surprised by the five reviews.  I'm not a baker so this is the first time I've actually made non-box brownies.  I was THAT excited by the thought of bacon and brownies.  

I think the problem is the honey.  The HONEY, I discovered, is what gives these (DELICIOUS-much-better-than-mix) brownies that "hmmmmm" factor.  But eventually you realize, "Oh, that 'different' flavor is HONEY."  I followed the recipe exactly and could really not taste the bacon at all.  It was a nice addition texture-wise but I may make them again without the honey.  The honey completely covered up the salty bacon flavor, I think.  :(

These brownies were a big hit with my bacon-loving, chocolate-loving boys (big and little).  The bacon adds a nice salty depth to the chocolate, and the brownie recipe itself is very good. I'll definitely be making this again!  As the 17-year-old in the house said, all it needs is peanut butter to really hit the trifecta! :-)

This recipe is AMAZING. It's the perfect chewy moist brownie, and the bacon is subtle. I didn't put the honey on the bacon when frying it, but they turned out fine. I used bacon to garnish the top, along with a peanut butter/chocolate frosting to enhance the salty sweet combination. I'm definitely keeping this just for the brownie recipe alone. Yum!!

I wasn't sure about this when I started but the brownies turned out fabulous! I was happy that I double checked and cut the bacon before I fried it. It has a rich chocolate flavor but just the right amount of salt to make the flavors dance on your tongue. I'm taking a batch to a party today and I hope they enjoy them as much as I did!

Agree great brownie recipe.  I made some for at home and was a big hit!  I made a double batch and took them to work.  Had some questions, like bacon and brownies??  They tried them and cleaned out the container.  I added two things to the bacon, 2 TBS agave nectar and 1 TBS brown sugar.  Very good!

This was interesting. VERY RICH... and I like the combination. I made the bacon in the microwave  I put Four prices, in for four minutes. And the bacon came out perfectly fine.  I skipped the honey as well but made additional bacon and mixed the honey, and some brown sugar. I will make this again personally I think people would be too skeptical to try it but I love it. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

MAKE THE BACON EXTRA CRISPY!! These brownies are rich and moist, and the bacon adds an excellent crispy, salty surprise! I can see why other reviewers may have had issues with the bacon if they didn't cook it well enough. Personally, I BAKED maple flavored bacon until very crispy and then crumbled it for the recipe. I didn't bother with the honey. When the bacon pieces are small and crunchy they are the perfect addition to the brownies. Don't forget to save some bacon pieces to sprinkle on top for visual effect.

I was really interested in trying these especially since bacon doughnuts are all the rave.  However, I did not care for them.  It just wasn't a good match for my taste.  I do love the the recipe minus the bacon.  I've never made brownies from scratch before and this one is a hit.  Don't have to buy box anymore.

These turned out great, the pan was cleaned before I could blink and several people asked for the recipe. I did add a touch of caramel drizzle on top too.

I made this and added the chocolate ganache on he top from the fudgey bacon supreme recipe. My first batch of bacon I cooked too long before adding the honey, so I put it to the side and gave it to my bacon loving neice because it was perfect for snacking. The second round of bacon came out better. I loved the brownie and will use the recipe for just that as I have nevertheless been a good brownie maker, even boxed ones came out horrible for me. I am not certain how these really tasted because everyone was so full from Christmas Eve diver, they didn't taste it while I was there. I admit to being disappointed because I thought they tasted pretty good, although next time I think I will just put bacon on the top instead of on the inside too. The brownies are really chocolatey  and rich and sometimes the bacon on the inside seemed too salty. A small piece of this goes along way. I am glad I added the ganache topping though. I baked the brownie, cooled it in the fridge, put the ganache on top, then placed bacon so that it defined where each piece would be. So he bacon on top was not cooked beyond what had been done in the pan with the honey. I like bacon less crispy, so it was fine for me. I also agree with a few of the other reviews that said people kind of turn their nose up when you say what it is, so be prepared. I was really proud of how this came out, but if I make it again, I will take it for something other than dinner so people are more inclined to taste it (and to people

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating because the construction crew that I made it for LOVED these brownies. I've only realized now that I read the recipe wrong. I wondered why it said 1 and a 1/4 pound of bacon! Such an odd amount.  oh boy! I need new reading glasses. I cooked the bacon in the oven and then crumbled it because it was easier for me. No wonder! But the excessive amount of bacon worked (I reserved some to place on top before baking) Thank you for the great recipe!

this recipe is another out of this world. using the simple cannaButter , using 3.5 grams of Kief and cutting a 9x9 pan into 25 squares will make a serving size of 2 brownies...3 if your hard core! I like 3 myself. use 1 stick of butter in this recipe. more reviews from the Canna Cooker to come. follow us!!

These are really good, my whole family loves them and so do my friends at school. One thing I recommend tho is putting chocolate chips at the bottom of the pan before you pour in the batter, and as they cook put powder sugar on top. It makes then bout twice and good. They melt in your mouth.

I baked these the minimum amount of time, because I had other things needing to bake after, and it definitely needed the longer time. Had to eat them with a spoon, even after they had time to cool and set. Still tasted pretty good, so will probably make them again, just will bake them longer.

I love the brownie mix...With Out the bacon.  Five stars for the brownie mix, I just didn't find the bacon good at all. Just my preference.

I admit that I can not bake well. I also have a oven that hates me. The batter was delicious but by the time I was getting a clean knife when testing them they were really quite dry. Do not go past 30 minutes.
