We loved this.  Double the sauce and reduce it for more flavor and thicker consistency.

This was simple and tasted great!  I used 4 Bone-in chops, cause that's what I had, and the sauce was just enough for 4 chops... so I would definitely make more sauce if making 6 chops.  I used powdered ginger instead of fresh (what I had) and left out the watercress and orange garnish (did not have on hand). I served this over brown rice with a salad on the side and had the whole thing on the table in less than 30 minutes!  Woo Hoo! :)

Very good - but I definitely recommend doubling the sauce. For 6 pork chops, there is barely enough to cook all of them in, let along "pass around." Once I got enough sauce going, this was excellent. I didn't have any watercress - served this on chopped butter lettuce with parsley. Thanks!!

This was good.  A little salty, but we served it over plain white rice which made it fine.  Not very orange-mustard.  Would add more of both next time and less soy sauce.

My husband is still raving about the sauce! I followed the recipe and the advice of the other reviews doubling the sauce.  I served over wild rice with cauliflower.  Very easy for a weeknight dinner! Going to try it over chicken breast too.

I didn't have OJ so I used cranberry-pomegranite juice instead. I only used 1 tbs of honey and then used 1 tbs of orange marmalaide. The sauce was great but I over cooked my pork. I think my meat thermometer is broken and I'm not experienced enough with figuring out how long meat takes. I will try again and maybe with chicken too.

Really easy and very tasty.  I added sliced mushrooms to the sauce and served it with mashed potatoes.  I'll definitely make these again.
