We thought the pumpkin and spices were either way too overbearing or simply clashed with the rest of the ingredients and tried to blend fall veggies with a spice/pumpkin dessert.

I think the spices and everything was good EXCEPT the red bell pepper. It is too overpowering and that's all I taste in the soup. Next time I will skip the bell pepper all together.

I thought this was very tasty. I used green pepper instead of red and two apples instead of a pear. Great flavor and texture. I would definitely make it again (hopefully with an immersion blender instead of a magic bullet next time!)

A friend and I tried making this using the 8-serving quantities (without the evaporated milk) and found that it was totally overpowered by the spices - 1 1/2 teaspoons of each was far too much - and by the red pepper. Our soup was also far too thick. Overall it ended up being virtually inedible.

When I made this I put in about a teaspoon of garlic, as I was stir frying the onions and bell pepper. I used fresh pumpkin.  When it called for can milk I put in a pint of half and half, and a quarter of a cup of heavy whipped cream. I omitted the honey and put in a cup and a half of light brown sugar. I also omitted the salt and pepper and let the do that to their own bowl. This was the first time making pumpkin soup and I loved it. I have a friend that has had this kind of soup before and she loved the soup. 
I will be making this soup again.
