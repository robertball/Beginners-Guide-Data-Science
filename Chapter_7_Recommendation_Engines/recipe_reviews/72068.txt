Winner Dinner!  Everyone loved this.  I ended up having to change it a bit when I realized I didn't have enough chicken breasts for 6 of us & had to stretch it.  Instead of full breats, I cubed it in 1"-2" pieces and then followed the recipe directions (including pounding them)--however, this change did require using more flour/egg/panko bread crumbs.  Basically I ended up making chicken type nuggets (only better!).  Places the nuggets over Jasmine rice & topped with Sweet & Sour sauce:  3/4 c. white sugar, 2T. brown sugar, 1/3 c. white vinager, 2/3 c. unsweetened pineapple juice (save chunks), 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1T. Ketchup, 2T. cornstarch.  Boil until thickened and then I added 1 thinly sliced green pepper & cut up pineapple chuncks.  Topped with sliced green onion.  Fed my family of 6 for a lot less $$$$ then the local Chinese carry-out & they said they liked mine better! :)

Great recipe!  The chicken katsu came out crunchy and delicious.  (ETA: I slice the chicken breast to three or four thin fillets instead of pounding them.)  The only thing I would suggest is to pre-heat the oil on medium heat then reduce it to low-medium for the actual frying; 3 minutes on medium-high heat pretty much blackened my panko crumbs.

My mom and I both made this dish. As written it is good but a little bland and since several in our family don't want to cover their food with sauce,  the second time we made she used 1 cup of hot sauce, 1/3 cup of cold water, garlic powder, salt and black pepper and three eggs.  She then dredged her chicken in flour then dipped it into the hot sauce mix, then the panko crumbs then fried.  This added a nice flavor, it was not hot.  I just rubbed a mix of spices into the chicken and fried.  Both families loved it with the extra flavors.  The panko crumbs are a must.  We plan on trying this dish by baking.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you.

I found panko breadcrumbs at a Wild Oats grocery store here in northeast Ohio. They are wonderful! Everything you fry turns out so light and crispy. The whole family loved this chicken. I served it with spicy Tonkatsu sauce (1/2 c. Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 c. ketchup, 2 T. light soy sauce) drizzled over and finely chopped green onion to garnish. We had steamed white rice and stir-fried veggies on the side. My boys asked when I'd make this dinner again... that's the sure sign of a winner! :)

Very good!  My husband made this and followed the directions, although he ended up needing more of all the breading ingredients, and used less oil for frying.  It seems like everyone has a tonkatsu sauce recipe.  Here's mine for a tangy, yummy sauce:  1/4 c. ketchup, 1/3 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. worchester sauce, 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, garlic powder and pepper to taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and easy!  The chicken came out nice and crunchy.  The oil heating directions were right on the mark - my stove comes with a 'medium-high' setting.  Another tip - put in the tip of a chop stick.  If bubbles come from the chop stick, the oil is ready.  My husband and I really enjoyed this and I'll make it again.  The leftover chicken was still crunchy after refrigeration!

Great! Feels like I am eating shrimp. Maybe next time I will try coconut with it. It definatly needs dipping sauce. we tried sweet and sour sauce 2 and Tonkatsu sauce. They were ok with it but next time I will try the sauce we use with shrimp. 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 a cup of vinegar, 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and 3 tablespoons of water. Cook in a small pot for about 10 minutes.

This was great!  I absolutely love Panko bread crumbs...it is the best!  I did make one alteration and that was to cook my chicken in butter. It was soooo good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My family loves this!  I add a bit of garlic powder to regular flower mix to add a little bit of twist and it is just delicious~  Also, Katsu sauce by Kikkoman is just great with this~

The coating is very crispy, which we loved, but it's bland.  Even after seasoning liberally with salt and pepper, it does not have enough flavor.  I'd suggest either marinating the chicken breasts in your favorite marinade or sprinkling with additional seasonings.  We will make again but definitely kicked up with more flavor next time!  If you want classic fried chicken (like I grew up with in the South), you'll need to search for a different recipe.

This was delicious.  I served this with a side of chicken fried rice and a cabbage salad, which I made using a bag of cole slaw mix and used the dressing from the Asian Chicken Salad recipe on this site to pour over the cole slaw.  I also used another reviewer's tonkatsu sauce recipe, to dip the chicken.  This meal will become a part of my dinner rotation, for sure.

Thanks for the recipe!  Baked mine in the oven, and the panko browned very nicely.  I sprayed the pan with non-stick stuff, and flipped half way through the baking time at 400 for 20 min.  YUM OH!!!!!

This is one of those dishes that everyone in my family will eat. Even though it is fried, the chicken and coating were rather delicate. I served it with steamed rice, and shredded cabbage tossed with rice vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil. I also made a tonkatsu sauce by simmering 1/2 C Ketchup, 1/4 C Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 C. dry white wine, 1 T minced Ginger, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 T sugar, 1 T soy sauce, 2 T mirin, and a splash of water (it cooked for about 30 minutes). I fried the chicken in batches and held them in a 350 degree F oven until everything was ready to serve. Thanks for the recipe!

This a hawaiian favorite. When i crave a local favorite, i'll make this. I've never maade it with chicken breast, I normally use boneless skinless chicken thighs. Another thing I do is soak the chicken in egg and shoyu(soy sauce). As for a dipping sauce, i normally use ketchup, but there's this other sauce. It's filipino style ketchup is called bannana sauce, it's actually pretty good if you like something savory and sweet. If you think it lacks taste, soak it for a little while in shoyu.

I used pork cutlet to make Tonkatsu and it turned out perfect!  Crispy outside and moist and tender inside.  I used olive oil for frying.  Served with white rice, tonkatsu sauce, and cabbage salad.  Perfect combination.  Thanks for a great recipe.

WOW! 5* for this one! Even my Husband loved it, my kids even cleaned off their plates. I made the sauce like tizzylizz suggested, and boy is this a keeper. For the Katsu, I used chicken tenderloins, cut lengthwise in half, and added in water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bell peppers and onions to the sauce.
" Sweet & Sour sauce: 3/4 c. white sugar, 2T. brown sugar, 1/3 c. white vinager, 2/3 c. unsweetened pineapple juice (save chunks), 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1T. Ketchup, 2T. cornstarch. Boil until thickened"

my favorite way to prepare chicken breast! i used homemade panko bread crumbs and homemade sweet and sour sauce (mentioned in one of the most helpful comments)
panko bread crumbs
3 c ground saltine or oyster crackers
2 tbs dried thyme
2 tbs dried basil
1 tbs chili powder
2 tsp freshly ground pepper
grind crackers in a food chopper until they resemble coarse crumbs. when theres 3 cups, add to a resealable bag along with the other ingredients. shake 'til ingredients are evenly distributed. spread on baking sheet and bake at 325 degrees F for 6-8 minutes until dry (not brown or toasted). shake pan twice during baking and check often. can be stored in a resealable bag, a container, or even in the freezer in a tightly sealed container.
use for your chicken katsu, fish, soup topping, casseroles... :)

I made this last night for dinner and my family and I LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT! Made it exactly as written (fried in peanut oil) and served it with rice pilaf, corn and barbecue sauce on the side for dipping.  Will definitely be making this again and will be sure to make the tonkatsu sauce to go along with it.  Thanks for a real winner.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this chicken. For his portion, i followed the recipe exactly and for me,I baked it instead of frying(375 degrees for about 25 minutes and it was perfect) I tried a bite of the fried version and i prefer it baked. Topped with Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Sauce and served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Fantastic!

It's pan-fried chicken...nothing special at all. I should have expected it from the ingredients. Absolutely fine, but not something I need a recipe for!

I love the panko bread crumbs.  Makes for wonderfully crunchy chicken.  Although leftovers don't reheat well.  You loose the crunch.  Great recipe!

I was taught to make this recipe by my dear Japanese friend and immediately saw the mistakes.  Slice the chicken thin so it cooks faster.  Dry the chicken and the sprinkle on both sides some garlic powder, salt, & pepper.  Mix the egg with a teaspoon of Oyster Sauce.  AND!!! Eliminate the flour.  Much better.  My family freaks out every time I make my version.  Not bland at all and can be reheated the next day for a quick snack.

We love this recipe!! We use egg beaters instead of an egg and I make sure I use a fork and make sure I use the fork to press the panko crumbs onto the chicken. This seems to make the coating stick better. Highly recommend. Even my two young boys love this recipe! We like to add rice and sweet and sour sauce.

This is a pretty fantastic way to make fried chicken!  it's quick and simple, try adding a little hot sauce to the egg mixture if you like a bit more flavor!

Really great recipe, even my picky 12 year old loves it.   I used tenderloins and cut into 1" pieces before the breading process.  Makes each piece crispy.  I also used a deep fryer, doing 15 pieces at a time for maybe 2 1/2-3 minutes, drain on a paper towel.  I altered Cardamon's tokatsu sauce recipes just a little.  Here is my version: 1/4 c. ketchup, 1/3 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. worchester sauce, 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, garlic powder to taste and 2 heaping Tbl. brown sugar.

Excellent!  I used chicken tenderloins and didn't bother to pound them.  I also added a little cayenne pepper with the salt and pepper because we like a little zing.  This one is a keeper!

I am a frying novice and had trouble finding the right oil temperature.  It was too cool when I started and the chicken absorbed too much oil and took awhile to cook.  The flavors were still excellent!  I served with a warm sauce of honey, mustard and white wine.

I LOVED this recipe. The chicken was super tasty! It was so simple, yet really flavorful. I too fried it in olive oil, and we topped ours with sweet and sour sauce. It was SOOO good! I'll never cook chicken breasts with any other coating. This was my first try with Panko, but what a difference it made!

Yummm! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish ~ every bit as much as I enjoyed it at the Big Island Grill in Kona, Hawaii last summer. Now I need to whip up a batch of beef teriyaki, then locate some Hawaiian sweet potatoes for the sweet potato haupia cheesecake and I'll be in heaven. Thanks again

As I read this recipe, my thought was...regular old fried chicken tenders. so I read through the reviews to see what suggestions had been made. I saw the review from "Cooking 101" and decided to try it her way since my family enjoys hot sauce. I was leery about the amount of hot sauce used. I like a little kick but am not interested in 'melt your mouth off' hot. But I decided to use the full one cup of hot sauce anyway. I am soooo glad I did.I used the 3 eggs and 1/3 cup of water and I put in about 2 tablespoons each of garlic powder and onion powder as well as ground sea salt and freshly ground pepper. The outcome was so good that I ended up taking out another package of chicken and making the recipe all over again! By this morning, there were two-and-a-half strips left. I was also told this morning by my husband that they taste even better the next day. I served the chicken strips with Spanish yellow rice, a dollop of sour cream and homemade sweet & sour sauce (under this recipe from reviewer TizzyLizz - delicious). Thanks for the recipes and thanks for the improvement tips.

Wow! I've made many recipes from allrecipes.com and this is the first time I've been inclined to write a review. This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken tenders without pounding them. Perfect! Those who said it was bland were absolutely correct but MAKE THE SAUCE ( " Sweet & Sour sauce: 3/4 c. white sugar, 2T. brown sugar, 1/3 c. white vinager, 2/3 c. unsweetened pineapple juice (save chunks), 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1T. Ketchup, 2T. cornstarch. Boil until thickened"). The combo is incredible. I made oriental-flavored fried rice and used the sauce for that also. Served up with green beans and it was perfect. If I could find a way to make it without making such a huge mess (dipping and frying - lots crumbs and oil splatters), I'd do it once a week. As another reviewer suggested, I did replace my oil before I did the second batch (I was cooking for 8). However, I made a small 3rd batch with the same oil and had no problems with the panko crumbs burning.

I tried this for dinner tonite. Came out really moist to the point where it almost squirted at me when i cut into it. you can also cut the chicken into strips and make them like nuggets. I used sweet and sour to dip my chicken in and i also used brown rice in my steamer. Very good!

Ok I made this recipe this evening ,and I had to run over to the computer right after dinner. It was so tasty we just loved it. I am now in love with Panko bread crumbs! I think it is perfect just the way it is and if someone feels it needs more of a kick that is easy to do with different spices! Thank you!

This was really good.  This is one of the first recipes that I have tried with Panko...and they are so much better than regular breadcrumbs.  I didn't know that you would need some kind of sauce or gravy because as it stands it is a little bit bland.  I fried it in olive oil...maybe next time I will fry in butter like Josie suggested.  Thanks for the post.

This is simple, quick and DELICIOUS!  I don't think we'll make chicken cutlets any other way.  I can't believe what a difference the panko bread crumbs make.  We leave the breasts a little thicker (closer to 1/2 inch), and they turn out juicy AND crispy.  Yummm! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Best recipe found yet, and so simple. don't forget the salt and pepper seasoning, essential for good taste. Heat oil carefully on medium to medium low so not to burn.

This is great! I liek to Brine my chicken for a few hours in water, salt and a little ginger...
this is delicious, and better than any crunch you get from KFC. Best eaten right away, it doesn't microwave well..

A classic katsu recipe.  I usually use pork cutlets but chicken is fantastic this way.  Ton katsu sauce is a must as an accompaniment.

I used garlic salt for more flavor and the only panko crumbs I had were lemon herb flavored so that's what I used.  I used olive oil too and they came out perfect and so tasty.  I served it with "Japanes-Syle Cabbage Salad" (on this site) and white rice.  This was like a restaurant quality meal!

This became a family favorite the first time!  I made no alterations to the recipe it's perfect the way it is.  The breading doesn't fall off and the chicken stays moist and tender.  As always make sure you are working with thawed chicken for best results.  I once used chicken slightly frozen in the middle and it led to having to overcook compromising the tenderness of the chicken and the taste and texture of the coating.   This is a fool proof quick and easy recipe and we serve over noodles and a red sauce.  Delish!

I really enjoyed this. I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I cut the crust off of some white bread, dried it in the oven, and ran it through the food processor. It gives you the same texture.

This was really good! I made just as written except I did sprinkle the chicken with curry powder as well. Definitely a keeper!

I've now made this recipe many times exactly as written, and we love it. The Panko coating is the secret, in my opinion -- you just can't get that crunch with breadcrumbs.

Love it.  Make with chicken or pork whatever I have in the fridge.  Make the Katsu sauce from allrecipes and serve over plain ramen noodles mixed with the katsu sauce :)

Just as good as in my favorite Japanese restaurant! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! Took one reviewers advice and heated the oil on med/high and then cooked it on med to med/low. My kids loved it. I will be using this recipe again and again!

This recipe was simple and delicious. I used seasoned panko because that is what I had but no other changes. All 5 family members loved it. Hopefully your grocery store sells chicken cutlets already pounded thin like mine does. I use them all the time as I think their quick cooking time ensures a juicy final dish. Served this chicken with rice and roasted asparagus. Also made the tonkatsu sauce recipe from this website. I will make this again!!

I hadn't had good Chicken Katsu since we lived in Hawaii and was really craving it.  I tweeked the recipe a little and I marinated the chicken in tempura sauce for 20 min. I then added the salt and pepper to the flour instead of the chicken.  This has now become our families #1 meal!  This is better than any of the mainland restaurant versions I have had yet!

Very basic chicken recipe, but very delicious.  Sometimes less is more and this is definitely the case.  The panko bread crumbs make all the difference.  A definite keeper.

I loved this chicken, it was deliciously crispy and tender just like something you'd buy at a restaurant. I WAY oversalted it, but that was my own fault! I served it with sesame noodles I made up on the fly: thin spaghetti, butter, olive oil, a splash of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil, a little salt and a whole mess of sesame seeds. It also would have been good with some broccoli added in. **Update** I can't stop making it, it's just SO crispy/tender/perfect! Lately I've been serving it with a salad and a toasted roll with butter - I don't even make any sauce for it - and it's sooooo good that way!

For the blandness, just remember to season the flour beforehand. Also, if you have access to an Asian grocery market, get yourself some tonkatsu sauce to put on the chicken, it's great stuff!

This is a great recipe. I did change it up a bit to make it flavorful and easier. I used two chicken breast and cut them in half so the chicken would be thinner. I then seasoned with some garlic powder, blacl pepper, lemon pepper, and a little red pepper on each side. I put the halves inside a zip lock bag and pressed all of the air out before before sealing. I then used a wooden tenderizer and beat each side. I then cut the halves in half again to make thin chicken tenders. After that I heated the oil. While the oil was heating I took out three bowls (two regular size, one big) and made an assembly line towards the heating oil. First bowl has flour, second bowl has beaten egg, and third bowl (the bigger one) has some panko bread crumbs. I then put a plate with paper towels on the other side of the heated oil pan. After this set up just use a fork to dip the chicken in the flour, then the egg, then the crumbs. Then fry and put on plate. I always found assembly lines easier when making this type of food. I used the store bought tonkatsu sauce by kikkoman with the chicken and served with brown rice topped with a little gomaiso (salt and sesame seasoning), and an asian coleslaw mix (i added a little sesame oil to it) that i got from the bagged vegetable section at the grocery store, its just shreded napa cabbage with a little carrot and celery. Closest thing to an authentic Japanese dish :)Thanks for posting the recipe. Hopfully more will discover the beauty of panko bread crumb

i used to make this all the time when i wasn't counting my calories :o(  difference is i don't pound chicken - i slice w/my knife held at a slant and cut pieces 1/2" thickness or less.  my secret twist on this recipe is instead of seasoning chicken with salt & pepper - i season w/lemon pepper seasoning.  chicken katsu is a staple in Hawaii! serve with tonkatsu sauce or ketchup w/worchestershire sauce mixed in.

this is an excellent recipe for chicken katsu.  i'm from Hawaii and have this all the time at restaraunts (especially l&L's!) and tried to make it at home with this recipe and it was fantastic. some people complained that it was on the bland side, but that's because it's supposed to be eaten with tonkatsu sauce. you can find recipes for it, but i prefer kikkoman's tonkatsu sauce. you can get it at any Asian market (i go to the Korean one) or probably in the ethnic foods section at your supermarket. don't eat this without the tonkatsu sauce because it's just not the same.  i used chicken tenders and they were a lot easier to cook than chicken breasts.  saved on the pounding.  i fry this in a frying pan and have noticed that when you don't change the oil, some of the panko flakes burn and stick to the next batch of chicken.  so i just empty out the pan and fill it with new oil before i fry the next batch.  this helps to keep all the chicken golden instead of looking and tasting burnt.

Excellent. I agree that it needs a dipping sauce or has to marinade; alone, it's bland. The texture of the coating and the moistness of the meat are fantastic, though. It's very important to pound the chicken enough. The Panko browns quickly, so if the breast is too thick, the coating will be dark before the chicken is cooked. I had better luck cutting some into strips; these turned out better. Also, the Sweet-Sour Sauce in tizzylizz's review is excellent!

I made this for dinner tonight and we all enjoyed it, especially my 3 1/2 year old, he chowed down big time. I made these into strips, like chicken fingers, to make dipping easier. Followed the instructions for the most part, I think I used more bread crumbs than it called for. Served it with basmati rice (our new favorite) and sweet-n-sour dipping sauce. Will definitely make again.

Appears as if you'll have yourself a pretty simple and basic meal... chicken, flour, breadcrumbs, etc. But WOW! This was far more flavorful than I was expecting! As someone else commented, the panko crumbs make a huge difference vs. regular bread crumbs. Very easy to make, very enjoyable to eat! I'm looking forward to having this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Panko makes a great coating for fried foods, but, because of its particle size, it does not carry seasonings very well. To spice up this dish, try putting the spices into the flour pre-coat.

Love it. My three year old kept eating so much I had to make more. It's so so good. I made mine with seasoned rice, broccoli and cauliflower mix.

Very easy and makes nicely crispy chicken. Next time I'll probably add paprika for a bit of extra flavor.

Everyone loved this! I used pork cutlet because its what I had but I imagine its just as amazing on chicken. I did sprinkle with garlic & onion powder in addition to the S&P but that is a personal preference thing. Delicious with Sweet Chili sauce or Ponzo sauce (its like a  citrusy soy).  

I doubled and needed about 2 1/2 times on the crumbs & flour. I had leftover but less was too difficult to get even coating.

Awesome, not tough at all for a novice chef such as myself... Just need to figure out where to get Katsu sauce from and I'll be alright...

Good, but better because I added spices to the egg mixture. It would have been pretty bland other wise, but I really good recipe to learn how to make the dish.

This chicken was really bland.  If I didn't make dipping sauce we probably would not have eaten much of it.  My husband agreed it might be improved by adding wasabi powder to the breading.

SUPER YUM-o!!! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this. When paired with Soifua's tonkatsu / katsu sauce, this is the BOMB!!! The key is to drizzle just a touch of sauce over your chicken (FYI, a little sauce goes a LONG way...). Another tip I have to share has to do with frying your chicken. One reviewer commented that medium-high heat was a touch too hot and that her chicken got REALLY brown on this setting. I fried my chicken (cutlets) on medium-high for 3.5 minutes per side and they were perfect - a beautiful golden brown color, crisp on the outside, tender thruout and VERY tasty! I just wanted to comment that I followed sakuraiiko's directions to the letter and was thoroughly pleased with the outcome. Use whatever heat setting works for you, but do know that this recipe is perfect as is (IMHO). For a little something special, try serving your chicken sliced (on the diagonal) atop a bed of shredded Napa cabbage with a drizzle of katsu sauce and a sprinkling of chopped scallion (Mmmmm...). Steamed rice is a perfect (and simple!) complement. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, sakuraiiko. I added this to my "keeper" file after just one bite! :-)

This recipe is great!  We usually have katsu and/or tonkatsu once every couple of weeks.  This recipe is also good for making pork tenderloin, just fry it up, put it on a bun with mayo and whatever else you like (lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc...) and it's just as good as any you'd find at the county fair!  For those complaining about blandness, this is meant to be eaten with katsu sauce, so look up a recipe for that and you will find the flavor you are searching for.

This is a good recipe to start with, but if prepared as written, it's bland.  I will try it again, but will kick it up several notches with some herbs and seasonings.

Delicious. I made this last night exactly as the recipe suggested. It didn't mention what oil to use so I used Olive Oil. I put too little in at first so the sides weren't getting cooked but was able to add more.

I couldn't find tonkatsu sauce, but I made my own using ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, ground mustard, and black pepper. It came out well, but I think plain ketchup would have tasted well also.

I sided it with boil-a-bag rice and it was an exceptional meal, with enough left over for lunch today!

This was awesome! The cook time was right on and the chicken turned out juicy and delicious. My panko crumbs didn't burn at all. I went ahead and bought chicken breasts that were already cut thin (because I'm lazy lol) and also cooked some jasmin rice in my rice cooker to go along with the chicken. So easy, I'll definitely be making htis again.

Very nice.  You can sub finely crushed saltines for the panko with the same results and save some $$.

This was amazing :) Having lived in Korea and japan for some time, this is simply a reminder of being in those places. I made it for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I added steamed rice and stir fried vegetables with sweet chili sauce to the chicken recipe, and it turned out to be one of the best dinners we've ever eaten. Also, to the chicken which I thought might be just a bit bland, I added curry powder, and a seasoned tenderizer along with the salt and pepper. Great job!

Excellent recipe!  Chicken is tasty, juicy, and tender.   Tip:  if you're frying more than one batch at a time, change your oil in between batches, or your panko crumbs from the first batch will burn and stick to your second batch.  Also, keeping them on the thinner side ensures that you have a nice golden brown coating - thick pieces take too long to cook and the crumbs brown fast.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!  Easy, had everything on hand and added hot sauce to jazz it up, as stated by other reviewers.  Definitely best eaten same day, but the leftovers were still very tasty, just not as crispy.  Thanks, I will be using it again.

Delish and definitely a keeper! I pounded out my chicken breasts a bit and then cut them in two. I dont care for tonkatsu sauce so I mixed up a sauce of soy sauce, honey and a shake of cayenne pepper and spooned it lightly over the chicken. Browned evenly and perfectly crisp. Chicken was juicy. I served it over a bed of sauteed cabbage and onions with steamed carrots on the side.

My husband loved this. Me, having had katsu before didn't as much. I guess it was a lot of work for something somewhat mediocre. Treat for the husband for sure.

Excellent.  Simple and easy, great for a quick meal during the week.  Medium high was too hot, as another reviewer recommended I heated the oil at medium and still had to turn it down to med low during frying.  Will definitely make this again.

Fabulous!  I had to turn down the heat a little when cooking it so it wouldn't burn and put just enough oil in pan to cover the bottom.  Once the chicken was done, I put sliced red onion and mushrooms in the remaining oil and panko crumb bits.  Incredible flavor!!!  Served with jasmine rice.  Will definately serve again.

Good but not much flavor.... If made again, I think I will add a little seasoning.

Delicious!  My husband had this dish at a hawaiian restaurant and requested I make it.  Very quick and easy.  Served with rice and teryaki sauce.  Will definitely add to the dinner rotation.

I made this recipe using boneless pork chops because that is what I had on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and was very pleased with the results.  It was my first time cooking with panko bread crumbs and I really liked the crispiness they added.  My kids and I enjoyed it very much.  I also made Tonkatsu Sauce using the recipe "Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce" from this site which was also very good.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used breast tenders and pounded them out.  It made perfect-sized "patties" to fry.  My kids were in heaven with this meal!

I will never fry chicken any other way! My family loved this..it is so crispy. I used chicken tenders instead of breast and I also added shredded sweetened coconut to the bread crumbs. Also, I used seasoning salt (not salt) It was amazing and the leftover chicken was great on top a salad the next day.

This was such an easy dish and good too.  I added some garlic powder, salt and pepper to the panko to give the chicken flavor.  I only used about 1/4 inch of oil to fry the chicken in.  It was crunchy and delicious.

I give this five stars just for crispiness. I added hot sauce to the egg and garlic, cayenne, and onion powders to the flour before dredging. I sliced the chicken breasts into fourths instead of pounding and it was fast and easy. Next time I'm going to try baking it to see if it turns out just as crispy.

They were perfect, just like the ones bought in restaurants.  I used Glico curry sauce with mine, but you can also buy the katsu sauce as well.

This is so good and so easy.  I added cajun seasoning to one batch of crumbs.  Yummy!  My family loved it.  Nice for slicing leftovers for salads or buns.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This.Was.So.Good! I made it with a honey mustard sauce I found on here. 1/2c Mayo, 1/2c Honey and 1/4c Yellow Mustard and WOW.  It was exactly like my favorite restaurants chicken strips!  I will definitely be making again! I added garlic salt/onion powder and seasoning salt to the chicken and a bit to the flour mix. I found I did need an extra egg and more flour then what was stated.

This was awesome! I made this with chicken tenderloin and had to use more flour, egg, & panko.  It was outstanding and even my picky 7 year old like it.  I did drizzle Tonkatsu sauce over the chicken & the jasmine rice I made.  I followed someone else's recipe for Tonkatsu sauce but had to make modifications to it.  This recipe is a KEEPER, thanks for sharing it.

This would have been 5 stars but I had to add Old Bay seasoning, salt and pepper because I knew it would be bland as the recipe is written.  I baked the chicken at 375 for about 20 minutes and it turned out really good!  I really like how crunchy the Panko makes it.  I'll make this one often.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I followed everything exactly, except I used smaller chicken "tender" pieces instead of large chicken breasts.  I also followed a previous poster's advice to heat the oil on high then turn it down to medium-high for actual frying.  The family loved it!  My 4-year-old dipped it in ketchup, but my husband and I used a spicy orange sauce.  I'll definitely make this again!

Good, solid recipe.  Can never have too many panko recipes.  Served with a simple tonkatsu sauce (1T each of soy sauce, Worchestershire sauce, ketchup, and sugar).

Ok...I changed this recipe ALOT.  Not because it was bad, but just to suit my needs.  I used chicken drumsticks, which I pan fried until dark and crispy.  then I coated with Tonkatsu sauce and baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious.  Husband loved it.  For the sauce I simmered 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup worchester, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce until reduced slightly.  Then I added 1 TB dijon mustard and 1/2 ts ground allspice.   Putting this in the review so that I can remember it :)  So good!

EASY & FAST - I changed this a bit - didn't have panko so used seasoned Italian bread crumbs. Added garlic powder and pepper to flour and omited salt. Used olive oil for frying.
Husband who isn't a big chicken fan said "best chicken" he had.

This was fantastic! I only had 3 chicken breasts, so I decided to make them into chicken strips.  I didn't veer from the original recipe, but I found I needed more egg, flour and panko to properly coat the chicken.  Amazing!  It is so crispy, tender and juicy, my husband and I simply adored it, we served it w/the Ginger Dipping Sauce from this site and it was absolutely wonderful. Best "Fried Chicken" Ever!!!

perfect cooking instructions.  the chicken was moist inside and crispy outside.  don't forget panko is unseasoned so be generous with salt and pepper.

This was so good, everybody loved it.  I sliced the chicken breasts into 1/2 inch "fingers" for faster cooking and they were perfect for dipping!

Fantastic!  I also tried this with pork tenderloins and it turned out great! (use medium heat if not a touch lower to keep the panko from burning)

This chicken is very easy and superb. Make sure the oil is good and hot before adding the chicken and only do a few pieces at at time so the oil doesn't cool down. By the time the outside is golden brown the chicken is done. We will definately be making this again.

A little time consuming frying the chicken.  But I made a brown gravy sauce with a little of the drippings to go over the top.  My family raved!!!

YUMMY .. Thanks for the recipe this is a keeper.  I made this with pork instead of Chicken .. I'm going to try using Chicken next time I make this recipe, I bet its going to be just as good as the pork! I ate this with some sticky white rice, Kim chee cucumbers, and some store bought tongkatsu sauce.  Thanks again!

First of all, my husband gave this a 10, so thanks for that, SakuraGirl1! I marinated my chicken first in Zippy-Zoo Marinade (on this site), because I was afraid the chicken might be too bland otherwise. The marinade was excellent, as was the taste, but my husband & I agreed that next time we will not marinate--just not necessary. The chicken was tender and delicately crispy. I had to use more flour, maybe because I cut my chicken into smaller portions. I used vegetable oil, but next time I will use a combination of olive oil and butter. My husband wondered how this would be as batter for chicken fried steak, so I will try it on that as well. One of the best recipes I have found on AR!

Very easy, and delicious as chicken tenders as well.  I agree with the reviewer who recommended lowering the temperature of the oil before frying the chicken.

This recipe is sooo easy! I sliced the chicken breasts in half, horizontally, and pounded them to get the slices thin. Used Kikkoman's Katsu Sauce and sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Served over jasmine rice (which I think is on the lighter side). And voila!

My husband and I have been making a very similar recipe for many years now. Our version,  I believe, adds much more flavor to this pretty bland recipe as written with just  a couple of "tweaks". I'm not dissing this version, only putting another idea out there... try adding the salt, and black pepper, as well as a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder (optional for sure), into a 1/4 cup  of the flour (mix together well before dredging).  As soon as the chicken is done cooking (golden brown on both sides), immediately transfer breasts to a paper towel-lined platter. Then squeeze 1/2 of a sliced orange over each HOT chicken breast. Serve  with extra orange wedges on the side :) Delicious! P.s. This  recipes works wonderfully with substituting fresh lemon  for the orange!

Ive been making this for year, grew up on this recipe with my father making it. Recipe is true to our family tradition my only suggestion, coat well with egg. Than, really not necessarily pound, but press the panko in there. I pan fry them, then at last minute, broil them for like 20 seconds while spread out on a sheet. So they are nice and hot and crispy. I also use chicken tenderloins. 

My father has a sauce I have always eaten with it. I grew up in hawaii and this sauce was pretty popular it seemed:

1 c Ketchup

1/4 c (or more to taste) worsheshire sauce

fresh cracked pepper to taste (i use a lot about 1/2 tb )

I was skeptical about making this, but I'm glad I did. I ended up needing more than 1 cup of panko breadcrumbs, and a tad more flour to coat.

The recipe is a great starting base, but you can definitely add more seasonings to your dish. I added a little extra salt, cayenne pepper and paprika to my chicken. I love spicy food and I'm known for liking my foods salter than some. I also left my coated chicken in the fridge for awhile before frying to make sure the panko sticks. 

I served my chicken katsu without any sauce, over rice pilaf.

Perfect chicken katsu. Didn't make any changes, just didn't measure anything. Figured the point was to cover the chicken, so I did. I also let the chicken sit out between layers of paper towels till it was about room temperature so it was dry, easy to coat, and didn't splatter as much when fried. Oh,  I also used crisco instead of oil to fry it. Already made again!

Came across this recipe and loved it! I had larger chicken breasts on hand so instead of pounding them, I just sliced them thin. I also seasoned my flour mixture and the panko crumbs with a little garlic powder, smoked paprika, cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper. I usually season my flour when frying chicken, so I just decided to do that this time as well. I used peanut oil and kept it between low and medium since any hotter would have really darkened the panko. I used the chicken in my caesar salad and it was outstanding! In fact, I dipped another piece of the chicken in some thai chili sauce because I couldn't stop nibbling; I was addicted to the crunch & flavor. This is a great recipe and fairly simple to make, you should definitely try this one!

I tried this recipe and added a little chilli powder on the chicken and tossed in General Tsao's sauce (Couldn't find any katsu sauce at my local grocery) and it tasted as good if not better than my the spicy katsu from my favorite restaurant. I was surprised at how fast and easy this dish was to make. This is definitely going to be a staple in my kitchen for a very long time. Thank you.

I'm giving this five stars because I was just scanning through my recipes and I remembered this one. my mouth started to water and I mentally prepared myself to make this later this week.  I prepared almost to the word,  just added some more of my favorite garlic powder to it (I can't seem to get through a recipe without it), and it's crispy,  moist and tasty with the tonkatsu sauce recipe found on this site. I highly recommend it.

The recipe as-is is VERY bland. I recommend adding some spices of your own, a bit more salt, or as my family does, rubbing on a bit of chicken base to boost the flavor. A huge improvement!

Excellent recipe! The crust is really crunchy and the chicken really tender. Next time I will marinade the chicken a little more to add some more taste. KFC just got themselves some competition...

Even though I always knew the basics for this recipe (I'm half-Japanese), I've always shied away from frying foods after a particularly bad frying incident. I took my time, though, and made sure to get the oil hot enough on medium-high heat (on my stove, a 7). I then tested out the oil by sticking a chopstick in the oil and saw bubbles (great tip from another reviewer!). I took down the heat a smidge to a 6 (thanks to the suggestion of another user), and went for it! I was using a 12 inch skillet, but fried two at a time so they could have plenty of room. I went for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Results were perfect! My family was very impressed and said it was one of the best meals I've ever made (served with white rice, Asian salad, and some mixed vegetables).

Perfect for us on frozen Chicken Tenderloin portions. As always, cook it once as the Poster of the recipe lists it.  Which is perfect and crunchy and mild so you can taste the chicken.  Subsequently add your family's favorite seasonings. Also excellent on sliced Pork Tenderloin.

This  turned out really good!!! I flattened the chicken and used vegetable oil for frying. I also added some chili sauce to the beaten egg and added a bit of seasoning salt to the chicken and salt and pepper to the flour. A new family favorite!!  :)

I used about 2 cups of flour and added about 1 tablespoon of salt and pepper to the flour.  Maybe even more than that!  I also used two eggs and a little more panko.  I heated the oil on medium and cooked it on a low medium for about 6-7 minutes on each side.  Came out perfect, and just like from home in Hawaii!  I served it on thinly sliced cabbage just like in Hawaii too.

Thanks so much for this awesome recipe. We usually go out to have this but I made it at home and it was great. The biggest change I made was instead of chicken I used tofu slices, it was great!

This was a huge hit with my family. I even goofed up and mixed the flour and panko together and breaded the pounded pork with the mixture and it was still tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

DELISH!  I didn't have the Tonkatsu Sauce and used Soy Sauce and it was still very yummy!  We WILL have this chicken again!  I served it with rice and stir fried vegetables.

Awesome recipe!

Loved it. So easy and delicious! I took the advice of keeping the oil on medium to fry it so the panko didn't burn. Yum! Will make again and again. Thanks!

I usually can't deal with chicken breast - just too dry.  This was NOT dry!  Absolutely wonderful, and even my very picky 9 year old went back for 2nds.  I did add some garlic powder, salt & pepper to the flour, and fried in half oil, half butter.  I used the tonkatsu sauce from one of the other reviews, but changed it a little: 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, 1/3 cup soy sauce, garlic powder, and honey to taste.  (I was all out of hoisin, so figured honey or brown sugar for a bit of sweetness - it needed it to counteract that much worcestershire!)  I needed 2 eggs, and I think you'll use more panko than the recipe calls for - I sure did!

So delicious.  I've made it with and without beating the chicken, and I can't tell the difference, so I don't bother.  It saves time.

We ate this alot in Hawaii. Instead of the panko, I use Italian bread crumbs, and instead of pounding, I just slice it sideways into 1/4 inch thickness.  Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe, and I DEFINITELY recommend it. I used pork chops the first time, and it was wonderful! My husband and my sister both loved it! I also made a Katsu sauce to go with it (you can find that recipe here too). I'm making it again for dinner tonight, now with thinner sliced pork (I used thick chops last time).

I made this twice.  The first time I made it exactly like the recipe and we found it good but a bit plain.  The second time I made it I marinated the chicken in worcestershire sauce, garlic, and green onions.  I also mixed chili powder in the flour.  This recipe was much better in our opinions.  We used the recipe for Katsu sauce that Diane suggested (1/2 cup worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp soy sauce).  It was delicious!!  Definitely a favorite with the minor tweaking we did!

WOW!  This was good and easy.  I seem to have the ability to wreck everything I cook, but not this.  Way to easy.  Make sure you eat them when they are hot.  I also made the tonkatsu/kaysu sauce from this website, I added a little more worcestershire.  It was pretty good.

Yummy! I made this exactly as the recipe said, but I didn't have a meat pounder so I just cut the chicken breasts into 4 strips each.  It worked just fine. I was hoping there would be some leftovers but my fiance, his friend and I devoured it! Next time I might put some hot sauce in with the egg for a little more flavor.

Awesome! Followed the recipe as written except I only had boneless chicken thighs on hand. It came out perfect! I was craving chicken katsu from our favorite Korean BBQ place but didn't want to spend the $23 +.  I had everything on hand: panko, tonkatsu sauce, chicken- I just needed a recipe! I missed the side dishes we get at the Korean place (choi sum, potatoes, kim chee, macaroni salad) but this katsu was better than any restaurant. I served it with tofu and white rice. My husband and daughter praised me for making this recipe. Thank you Ms. Sakuraiko for sharing!

This is exactly how my mom and grandmother raised me to make chicken katsu.  It's perfect!! My husband and three sons would eat this every single day if I'd make it for them. I serve with Bulldog Tonkatsu sauce, sliced cabbage and white rice.

This is absolutely delicious, easy to make, and extremely inexpensive. The chicken came out moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside. I used Tonkatsu sauce from the bottle but will someday try to make it myself. Just make sure to watch the chicken in the skillet because I probably flipped after just 2 minutes and it was sufficient. I didn't want the panko to get too dark/burnt. After heating the oil, I tossed in a pinch of panko to see how quickly it sizzled. This gives a good gauge as to whether the oil is ready to start frying. I plopped the chicken on to some paper towels afterwards to soak up the extra oil but putting it on a wire rack might keep it crispier as it cools down. Maybe next time! Thanks so much for the recipe! This has definitely made it into the dinner rotation!

This was very good.  You could almost add any spices you wanted to to experiment with this recipe.  The Panko crumbs make this recipe.  Next time I will follow the advice of others' and turn the heat down to medium when cooking.  Chicken was tender and tasty.  Made with Tonkatsu sauce from recipe on AR.

This was a great recipe. The chicken was moist and the bread crumbs were so flavorful and crunchy. The sauce is easy and is a MUST. Great recipe, will use again!

Love this! We had some seasoning to the flour just to add a little more flavour; garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper. If you want it really crunchy you could double dip the chicken. Great with tonkatsu/katsu sauce from AR.

I make this dish often and was excited to come across it on this site.  I do change it slightly as I season the panko crumbs well with garlic pepper, italian seasoning, paprika, and red pepper.  I season to taste depending on who I am cooking for and what I have on hand.  It is wonderful with sweet red chili sauce, couscous and edamame.   Sooo Good!

This is one of our favorite meals.  I serve it with sauteed cabbage, rice, and tonkatsu sauce made from Martin Yan's Feast.  His tonkatsu sauce really is the best I've ever had.

Simple, excellent recipe kids will love.  My daughter thought these blew away any chicken nugget out there.  Fried in canola oil with boneless, skinless breast - it is a healthier alternative, even though it's fried.  Will make again and again.

I have used this recipe for pork for years now.  A great variation is to substitute Cocunut oil. Makes a great dinner FABULOUS! Works for chicken or pork and is great with tonkatsu sauce.

This is exactly how we make chicken katsu in our Korean household. Love this recipe! We like to serve the katsu with white rice and shredded cabbage with thousand island dressing. Oh and don't forget the tonkatsu sauce (it's delicious).

The recipe stated that chicken or pork chops could easily be used. I opted for turkey chops. I heated the oil on 5, on med-high the oil would have gotten really hot, splattered, and burned the meat. I used plain bread crumbs instead of the panko, because the only difference is the panko are just more coarse. I also ended up tossing nearly half of the bread crumbs, so I thought it was a bit much. When done they tasted okay, but were not as tender as I had hoped. And, most of the oil also gets wasted, so I don't think so much is needed. This recipe is basically breaded and fried chicken, although it is much better than frozen, I would recommend a chicken gravy or dipping sauce for a little extra flavor.

This is how I will make my chicken from now on. It is so light and crispy. Added some parsley to the panko for a little color and used Old Bay on the chicken before dredging in the coatings. Also used EVOO to fry the chicken in, I think it gives a better flavor.

Easy quick recipe. I say add some spices to the flour or directly to the chicken before frying, it can be bland. I've sprinkled garlic powder, ginger and onion powder just to add something to it. Give it a try though and serve it with fried rice.

Very easy recipe.  I baked mine in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes to save on fat.  They came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The real hit of the meal was the sweet and sour sauce recipe posted by the top commenter!!

OMG, I loved this recipe.  I bought some panko at the store because I always see it used on the Food Network and had no idea what to do with it.  I chose this recipe to try and my family loved it! I will definitely be making it again.  The only thing was, after looking at some of the reviews, I decided to tweak the sauce a bit.  I added a TBSP of regular white and a TBSP of brown sugar, a TBSP of hoisin sauce and a tiny splash of Yoshida's gourmet original sauce.  It tasted perfect!  For the record, I will be making this again.

It was a little bland - I used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning instead of salt/pepper... next time I might use parmesan cheese in place of the flour.

I tried this in my search for a great katsu recipe. This is my second favorite after Shin98's Tonkatsu recipe. This is good as is, but some suggestions to try: Pound thin to 1/4" which helps with cooking thru before you scorch your breading. Use fresh crushed asian peppers added to the flour for heat (a little goes a long way). In fact, add powdered ginger and powdered garlic to the flour for more asian flavors. Just be careful as powdered ginger can be overwhelming. For a sauce, you can either make a tonkatsu sauce from this site, or you can go with my long-time favorite, Bull-Dog Vegetable & Fruit Tonkatsu Sauce (can order online if not at your local asian market).

crunchy and yummy!  I seasoned the flour a bit more by adding onion powder and using garlic salt in place of standard salt.  I omitted the oil and fried in butter as I prefer the flavor.  I made a Tonkatsu sauce of ketchup, brown sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce,and garlic, and served it with lightly sauteed onions and bell peppers, and a side of jasmine rice. Tasty and fun to eat Japanese at home!

I've cooked this a few times and it's great with cabbage and tonkatsu.  The few times I cooked it, it gotta pretty dark from having the oil too hot, once I got the oil temp under control the chicken tasted 10x better.  great recipe, easy and the whole family loves it.

What an awesome recipe! I made this last night with another katsu sauce recipe. I made following the recipe (flattening the chicken has to e the best stress relief I have found), it tasted better than the katsu at the restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!

Like others said - defintely NOT enough of the breading for the chicken. It is a good recipe, but the measurements need to be accurate. It is a bit bland - but that is what panko crumbs are. Will try a sauce with it next time as others have suggested.

I got a 10+ for this recipe from the hubby! I used panko crumbs from kikkoman and it worked beautifully. I also added garlic powder to the chicken and served it with some mashed potatoes. It was really good. Thanks!!

I love Chicken Katsu but had never thought to make it at home because I usually pick it up at a Hawaiian restaurant on the way home from work.  But when I came across this recipe I had to give it a try.  Wow!  I love it and it was so simple to make.  Just writing this review has me hungry for it right now!  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

Growing up in Hawaii, I am very familiar with this dish. This particular recipe is very good and exemplifies the basic recipe amoungst our very diverse culture here. I think it is wonderful! Combined with white rice, tonkatsu sauce, and served over shredded cabbage, we call this meal a traditional Hawaiian Plate Lunch!

We thought it was really good.  The bread crumbs are so light and airy.  It was much better than the breaded chicken that you buy in the store.  I baked it rather than fried it and it turned out perfectly.

Simple yet tasty. My oil was a bit hot on the first try and I blackened the coating a little but chicken came out perfect. Second time around was spot on, golden and crispy. Seems too simple a recipe for the great results. Next time I'll try kicking things up with some curry powder.

This was a little bland without the sweet and sour sauce another reviewer suggested.  With it, it was fantastic--and I'm not usually a fan of sweet and sour at restaurants.

This was wonderful.  I used porkchops that i pounded out to about a 1/4 in each.  I then followed the recipe exactly and made a wonderful dipping sauce.  To make the dipping sauce you need to boil 1/2 cup of rice vinegar then add 1/2 cup sugar and stir until dissolved then simmer for 5 min.  While that is simmering mince 1 clove of garlic and mash it together with 1/4 tsp of salt to make a garlic paste.  Throw that in that in the sauce and remove from the heat and then add 1 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  Let it come to room temp and serve.  Now it is pretty spicy so for the kids I had sweet and sour.  This will def go into the monthly rotation for dinner.

Great recipe! Try serving on raw shredded cabbage, squeeze lemon and then drizzle the tonkatsu sauce on top. The flavors blend very well and it is refreshing! Over the counter, ready made tonkatsu sauce can be purchased at the local Japanese market, the brand is called Bulldog and very good/convenient. This homemade recipe for tonkatsu is excellent.

I've had some sort of "cooker's block" when it comes to frying chicken correctly, so I really appreciated this recipe - all the coating stayed on the chicken as it cooked, and the result was moist and delicious. It was the first time I had used panko crumbs, and actually, this ended up being the recipe on the back of the box, so apparently it is tried and true. You will need to use an exciting sauce to pep up the flavors of your meal as recommended, since there is nothing overtly exotic about the chicken itself.

Come on! 5 stars for this? It isn't bad but it is simply breaded chicken with different crumbs. Had I known that the Panko crumbs weren't spiced and basically flavorless, I'd have never tried this.

My family requests this often. I use season-all to give it a little flavor boost. And I cut it into bite sized pieces to make it more kid friendly. The vinegar-based sauce is good too.

This made the best breaded chicken cutlet I have ever fixed at home. I loved the crispy crunchy light coating with the chicken. This is such an easy recipe and takes so little ingredients or time. I served this with homemade tonkatsu sauce. This is great and would also be fantastic as a base for lemon chicken or sweet and sour chicken.

Delicious!  Yes, it is "bland" but that's the way it's supposed to be!  :)  The sauce is what makes katsu, well, katsu.  I use Bull Dog Tonkatsu sauce.  The only change I made was seasoning the chicken with Ajinomoto before breading.  Yes, it's MSG, but all Asian dishes taste that much better with it.  :)

Great Dinner! Thanks, tizzylizz, for your review. Your ideas and Sweet and Sour sauce were great. I will be making this over and over again.  I will make a double batch of the sauce though. My kids loved it.

This recipe was very good.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and made the chicken into bite sized pieces and served over rice with a sweet and sour sauce.  I found the cooking time and temperature to be right on--no burning panko crumbs here.  The panko crumbs really make a difference.  My only change next time will be to season the chicken and/or flour more.  I have to say, overall delicious.  I couldn't stop popping the left over chicken pieces into my mouth after dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe was good. definitely pound the chicken to about 1/4" thickness before seasoning and breading it.  i did not give it 5 stars because i reserve that rating for the recipes that really "wow" me.... plus, it did not include directions for the sauce.  i used the recipe in one of the reviews below for the sauce (1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp water heated until sugar is dissolved) and was very happy with it.

Although wonderfully crispy,as many have said already, this needs more seasoning in the panko. Even my husband said so which is weird. He did however love the dipping sauce I put with it. Just equal parts of yellow mustard and honey.

This recipe is a good base.  I added more seasoning so the chicken would not be bland.  The panko adds a nice crunch.

Now I finally know how they make those big crispy fried chicken wings at the Chinese takeouts.  This made for a beautifully golden, juicy, and tasty chicken using the panko crumbs; they really make a big difference in flavor.  Added some garlic powder with sea salt and cracked pepper.  The crumbs adhered so well.  This was the best 'fried' chicken I've ever made.  Variations are endless with dipping sauces.  Great for kids.  Thanks so much for letting me finally use these panko crumbs that have been sitting in my cupboard for ages.

I made this the other night. Chicken was good, nice and juice inside, crispy outside - very delicious. One downside is the frying smell inside my house which lingered for at least two days afterwards. I suggest you ventilate well when you cook this recipe. Also, I used a basic Oriental dipping sauce with soy sauce and Hoisin sauce. It was okay with the chicken, but I think I'll try a sweet & sour sauce similar to one used with tempura next time. Definitely make this again. Thanks!

the chicken by itself was very bland.  Loved the texture, the quick cooking, stayed moist, but needs more flavor.  Maybe some garlic, season salt, etc. before frying.  Served with rice and sweet & sour sauce.

This was excellent!  My family loved it.  I could not find the sauce so I made my own dipping sauce.  (1 jar of apricot preserves, 2 Tbsp tamari (soy sauce), 1 Tbsp ketchup, 6 slices of unpeeled fresh ginger -- heat together in saucepan until bubbly.)

Great! I served this with white rice and a side of stir-fried vegetables, but didn't use the recommended sauce as it was somewhat expensive. Nonetheless, pineapple teriyaki sauce made a great substitution. Thanks for the recipe! :P

if you follow directions exactly, this comes out beautifully!  moist and tender chicken covered in crispy, golden brown crumbs.  make sure you pre-heat your oil, press the panko into the chicken well and liberally salt if you're not dipping and it comes out perfect.  thanks!

Amazing, and so easy to make!

My fiance and I love this when we eat out Japanese, and I thought we'd give this a whirl. I made it with a medley of chicken and pork, with sides of rice and a vegetable mix with bean sprouts.
Now that i gave it a test run, i can be confident to make it for dinner parties!

This was really good and so easy to make.  I have never used panko bread crumbs before and didn't think they tasted too much different, just a tad sweeter.  The coating was definitely crunchier than usual.  The only drawback was while frying, the house had a fishy smell!  Will make again!

This was delicious! It reminded me of Chicken Parmesan.  Since I didn't have any Panko, I've used Italian bread crumbs. It came out so good. I've paired it with mashed potatoes. Will love to make it again with Panko.

Wow! I always wanted to make Katsu Chicken but thought it was too difficult. Not only did everyone think it was delicious, but was super-simple to make. 

I even messed up the Tonkasu sauce with too much Worcestershire sauce and it was still amazing. Try this, you won't be disappointed!

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out great! Used Tonkatsu sauce on top. I do agree with other reviews that the chicken needs more seasoning.

This turned out well for me! It was super easy, and really good. Make sure you have enough oil to fry it in though or you'll have some issues. Thanks for this!

Really tasty and easy to make! First time making chicken katsu and it turned out really well. My only complaint was my chicken was a little too thick. Next time I'll probably pound my chicken into thinner pieces.

Like other users have said this is a good base recipe but the coating could definitely use a little kick , I added in onion powder, garlic powder, dry mustard, and paprika and it turned out great!

Also, the sauce was perfect.

I made this substituting flank steak for the chicken. I marinated the steak in a mixture of Katsu sauce, water, garlic, and soy sauce overnight, then followed the recipe exactly. It was so good my family keeps asking me to make it again... I’ve already made it 3 times since coming across this recipe less than two months ago.

I made this for my husband he loved it. I instead used seasoned Panko crumbs because hey, it’s all about the seasoning and flavor. I also made the tonkatsu sauce for the chicken. Very good for a quick easy dinner.

Used this recipe to make imitation CoCo Ichibanya. Made the chicken, used store bought microwave sticky rice and store bought curry sauce. Rice, chicken, curry, grated cheese. Will definitely be making again.

Good recipe! I cut my chicken breasts horizontally into 1/3" or so slices. Salt and pepper your cutlets well before breading. Set up a station of plates/bowls — flour, eggs, panko, in that order — then as you finish breading each one, lay it aside and finish the others. Don't add one to oil before you add all since they cook quickly. And, most importantly, you have to drizzle with some Bull-Dog tonkatsu sauce when you serve. That's where the flavor is!

This was so easy and so yummy. The whole family loved every bite. I served it with white rice and sweet and sour sauce. I did add some garlic powder to the flour coating while prepping the chicken because so many people complained it was kind of bland. I loved how it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I will definitely make this a regular in our home!

We in Israel call this "shnitzl" short for Weinershnitzl which comes from Austria (Weiner=Vienna) and is a national dish here usually made with breadcrumbs, either herbed or plain. Panko is available here for the last few years and I have been making these exactly like this since I could buy Panko. Always delicious although I've been using much less oil and getting similar results. So East and West meet happily in this one dish.

I added togarashi to the breading and flour.
Also added a wee bit of garlic in the oil a few hours before I turned on the stove - just to add a hint of that flavoring. My fiance loves it - says we shouldn't ever go to a katsu place since it's that good.

So simple to make and it is so good!!! I didn’t had panko so I used breadcrumbs I had and still it was good. Next time I’ll use panko and try it with pork chops.

I used a sous vide to cook the Chicken breast before dipping in the egg, flour & crumb mixture and quickly pan frying. It allows for a very quick fry with no fear of over-cooking the Chicken. Incredibly moist.

Soooo good! I'm from the South and I'm used to dense, greasy fried chicken, but this one was so light, and airy, and dangerously easy to eat! Others have said this needs sauce and I agree, which is the only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars. Other revisions included garlic powder during seasoning, as well as doubling the amount of flour.

I loved the crunch of the outside but there is zero flavor. To remedy that I made it again adding garlic powder, onion powder and salt to the bread crumbs and added Sriracha to the egg mixture. Much better!!

Made exactly as instructed with one exception - I didn’t have Panko, so I pulsed some herb-seasoned breadcrumbs in the food processor.  I think that may have perked it up a bit, but it was still a little bland.  And yet it tasted just like the Katsu I got in Japan!

The chicken was delicious, fried up really well. Went great with a sauce consisting of ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce, with a bit of salt and pepper.

This version I cut the boneless thighs to fit dog buns and julienne onions, carrots, jalapenos, sprinkled black sesame seeds and dosed with a sriracha aioli sauce. I've tried it with Italian seasoned panko, brining the breasts in sage, thyme and or rosemary, assorted sauces and dips, my personal favorite just simple Catsup, Worcestershire and cracked black pepper, ahhh yummy. This recipe is so versatile, thank you so much for an easy and worth while meal!

Great the way it is, but easy to switch up with seasonings. I buy chicken tenders and use the deep fryer.  I like to use sweet-sour or lemon sauce for dipping.

Definitely going to make it again! Maybe add a few seasonings such as garlic or ginger to the flour before coating the chicken in it.

I brined 3# of chicken tenders (2 cups water & 1-1/2 T Kosher salt) for 20 hours. Used 1/2 box Panko and about 1-1/2 C flour, and 4 eggs. Threw some Frank's Red Hot sauce into the egg mixture, and also marinated 4 of them in Frank's for 3 hours; couldn't really taste the spice, so next time, I'll brine them (for saltiness and moistness) for 20 hours, and then throw the brine away, and marinate them in Frank's for at least 12 hours! I love the crunchiness and will definitely make these again! (going for a Popeye's imitation here!)

Super quick and easy. I made this, but added a little garlic powder to the chicken along with the salt and pepper and made a thick spicy teriyaki glaze to pour over it. SO GOOD!

Absolutely delicious! My girlfriend, who doesn't typically like fried foods, loved this chicken. The only thing I did differently was use garlic salt to season the chicken instead of regular salt. I highly recommend it!

was great.  I never had it before but it came up on the dinner spinner and it was fast.  I had to chase down a recipe for the sauce which was frustrating because I never heard of it before and it was not listed here as an ingredient.

a little bland, but you can spice up the coating a bit with your own seasonings. go liberal on the salt and pepper.

This is the real deal when it comes to Chicken Katsu. Just like in the Japanese restaurants here in California.   Some people complained that it was tasteless which I disagree with.  Chicken Katsu cutlet should be served with Tonkatsu sauce or over Japanese Curry.   If you plan on eating the cutlet on its own then you should be generous with the salt shaker.  Or just make some Chicken Parmesan or Fried Chicken.   I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe except to double it to make even mooooooooore! Thank you for sharing!

How does this recipe get any stars at all?   It's chicken with only salt and pepper.  I was expecting some Asian inspired flavors.  American fried chicken has more seasonings than this!

Very simple recipe but plan to have a sauce or tonkatsu for flavor. It cooks beautifully and makes for juicy chicken. Just be sure to season well with the salt and pepper. Five stars because of the simplicity which is greatly appreciated on a worknight.

This was really easy. I'm a beginner at cookin and I made it with steamed rice and broccoli. For the tonkatsu sauce I like it a little more spicy so I added Sriracha sauce and for the dipping after u cover the meat in flour I added hot oil. So good!!

Delicious!  The panko bread crumbs make it so crunchy and the breading isn't soggy at all.  First I pounded the breasts to make them thinner and then seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Excellent!

Made it in place of Thanksgiving turkey. Took some of the suggestions from other reviews and added to it. It was a hit. The family loved it.

This recipe is okay. In addition to salt and pepper, I added garlic powder and just a little meat tenderizer because my chicken breast is thick. I used this for the sauce (see attached photo).

This was a good basic recipe for chicken katsu. I followed the recipe exactly this time so I knew what adjustments I wanted ot make the next time. When I make it again, I will try to add different seasonings to make it a little more flavorful but that's personal preference. This is a solid basic katsu recipe and my husband and three kids gobbled it up with some sticky rice and veggies.

I made this dish just the other day and it is so yummy, the chicken was crunchy, and flavorful! I served it over a bed of rice and a homemade sauce (Sriacha, soy, lemon juice, garlic, assorted Italian seasoning, and finally  weirsteshire!) it was so good but I made way too much, so I gave it away to a friend, and she's been sending me compliments on it all day, even her mother wanted the recipe! No changes needed this is a 5 star winner dish.

Super crispy chicken!  It was delicious, but I do agree with others that say it needs a sauce.  We had teriyaki sauce and duck sauce on hand, but neither was quite right.

Don't change a thing! Reminds me of Hawaiian plate lunch, yum! I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfect. Crispy outside, tender inside. I served it with Kikkoman katsu sauce.

This is a simple tried  and true recipe for breaded fried chicken. Only difference here is using panko instead of regular bread crumbs.
Certainly good, but nothing really too different here...

5.8.16  It would have been nice if the recipe author would have included a recipe for tonkatsu sauce because without it, this just tastes like good fried chicken breast, nothing particularly Japanese to me.  I don’t fry often, but when I do, this is the standard breading process I use for either chicken or pork.  FYI, there are some recipes for tonkatsu sauce on this site.  It was very good and crispy, and we enjoyed it.

This recipe is a delicious example of simplicity. Others complained about blandness, but in all my cooking I seek only to enhance the flavor of the food, not smother it. I used kosher salt, fresh coarsely ground pepper, and grated a bit of fresh Parmesan in the Panko.  I also added a bit of sweet cream to the egg wash.

This was great! It was a quick, easy dinner that satisfied us all! I made it gluten-free, with gluten free all purpose flour and gluten free panko breadcrumbs. It tasted great! I paired it with the Tonkatsu sauce from the site. Thanks for the recipe!

My toddler eats a whole chicken breast and asks for more when Chicken Katsu is on the menu. It's a great go-to for a quick dinner meal. Makes a messy kitchen, but it's worth the clean up!

It's not the same crispness without the Pinko crumbs.  I made this recipe several times with Pinko and then other times with finer Italian bread crumbs.  The Pinko really gives it an extra thick more crispy coating.  Just by changing the spice you can end up with southern fried chicken or Newfoundland fried chicken.

I made this for my girlfriend, and while we both agree it was good it was missing something to  me. I would suggest adding a couple of other ingredients to season the chicken. A previous review said they mixed hot sauce in with the egg and it didn't make it hot but added flavor maybe I'll try that next time.

Everything is great. But i think it would be better to include the optional Tonkatsu or another sauce that would be compatible with this recipe. I made it with Tonkatsu and it was Awesome.
reguardless thank you :) It went well with white rice Peas and i used the remaining left over egg  and scrambled it  in there.

This recipe is a go-to for me when I want crispy breaded chicken.  Panko bread crumbs work really well for making a crispy coating.  I agree that the chicken is bland, but we always serve it with katsu sauce and that livens it up tremendously.  This recipe is super-easy and has made me a loyal Panko fan.

I used to order chicken katsu at a restaurant by my work but i work from home now and was craving for it so decided to look for a recipe. Chose this one based on the reviews. Chicken alone was good but it tasted even better with the katsu sauce that was recommended by one other reviewer, i cut her recipe in half (1/4 c. worshchestire sauce, 1/8 c ketchup and 2 T soy sauce) bf never had chicken tonkatsu before and he said it was really good and the chicken went really well with the sauce. The only modification i made was i used cornflakes crumbs as i didn't have panko. Thank you!

That's pretty much as I've been making it for twenty years or more. Like Tonkatsu, it's nothing without the Tonkatsu Sauce but it certainly doesn't need any other flavours, it would no longer be Gyu Katsu. I never change any Japanese recipe, doing so would render them un-authentic and to me, authenticity is everything.

This is the best chicken Katsu ever! I just pound out my chicken super thin and it cooks so fast and crispy! Top off with katsu sauce from Kikoman and dinner is done!

Simple recipe, as it should be. Have made katsu many times and this is about as easy as it gets. I get tenderized pork cutlets instead though.

I will definitely make this again. I served this with  white rice and broccoli.  The sauce was AMAZING! The green onion was a nice pop of color and flavor!

excellent - but went by other reviewers and added hot sauce and seasoning to the egg wash prior to the panko.  The flavor was excellent.

Amazing! My whole family loved this! I made my own panko crumbs using a gluten-free bread. (Cut about 6 slices of bread into 1 inch pieces then put through a food processor to make coarse crumbs. Place on parchment paper on a baking tray, layer it evenly. Bake at 300 degrees F for about 6-8 minutes, shaking/turning crumbs about ever 3 to 2 minutes. Do not let it toast, just dry out.) This is a definite winner! Thank you for the amazing recipe!

This is easy and delicious.  Just to change it up I sometimes add red pepper flakes to the panko crumbs or parmesan cheese.  Just to change it up.  I do like using a Japanese sauce drizzled on it so if you don't have the bottled Kikkoman Katsu sauce on hand go to Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce on this site and you can make your own.  It is easy to make - I actually prefer it to the bottled version.  Another good dipping sauce is just  plain old sour cream with some sriracha sauce mixed in!

Not sure but I believe the oil wasn't hot enough.  Flavor was pretty good but did not have the crunchy katsu texture.  Next time we'll be using a deep fryer.

Bf loves it! I preheated the oil on med hi and once the cooking began I turned it down to med low. To keep that nice golden color. Taste just like how my Japanese step dad made it! I made a katsu sauce to go with it as well

This was SO very easy and enjoyable to make! I used coconut oil for frying and the chicken was so white, with just the right amount of crunch from the breading. My fried chicken loving, eldest son said that this was THE BEST chicken that he'd ever had.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just as hoped. Five stars for 5 out of 5 family members who devoured it!  The picky one ate it plain while the rest of us spiced it up to our liking. A great basic recipe for an easy and quick crowd pleaser.

The recipe is spot on for preparing the chicken. Simple works best! What's missing is the Katsu Sauce which should always be served with this recipe. Mix 1/4C catsup, 1/4C soy sauce, 1/4C sugar, 1-1/2tsp Worcestershire sauce, pinch of ground Red Pepper. Mix all together and refrigerate until ready to use. Slice chicken into 1" pieces and dip in sauce! Delicious!!

AWESOME!!!  We make this chicken and make S&B Curry Sauce to pour over with some grated cheese in it! This is like what we ate in Okinawa Japan at Cocos Curry House! Its amazing and we LOVE IT!  When we make the sauce we also add some red cayenne pepper to our taste! Thank You for the amazing recipe!

I just love this recipe.  The first time I made it, I added some pepper, paprika, garlic powder and garlic salt to the Panko and I liked it.  My family thought it was a little bland.  Next time I added more of the spices and we all thought it was even better.  The next time I make it, I will add even more but I'm going to add the spices to the flour mixture as well.  Thank you for posting the recipe!

The first time I made this it came out dry, so I tried it again with a slightly lower heat and it was perfect. Pounding the chicken breast pieces to 1/4 inch thick was challenging, but other than that, it was a pretty easy recipe.

great recipe.  we lived in Japan for  3 years and this reminds me of the recipe a neighbor lady made.  someone mentioned on here that if you are looking for a fried chicken recipe that there are other southern friend chicken recipes that are much better.  Well, DUH!  this is a Japanese style recipe, not southern style.

Good recipe just make sure the oil is not too hot or you will burn the outside before the middle is cooked. You just need a couple of minutes per side to not overcook, the breast came out tender and juicy. Served with mayo and sweet thai chilli sauce - it was a big hit and so easy to make. Will try to make japanese curry next time to go with it - katsu curry.

Good recipe. My mom always marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce overnight.  Adds flavor and moisture. Also you can use boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts.

I seasoned my chicken with Cajun seasoning, garlic salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, pappy's choice seasoning. I did everything else the same. I made this dish for my boyfriend it was his favorite dish while he was stationed in Japan.  I made a veggie curry and steamed rice to go with it!

The light seasoning is a perfect match with a baller katsu sauce.  Maybe I went heavy on the egg, but I needed two to complete my 4 breasts.  Will certainly make again!

This is fine, nothing special. It's what I'd call an easy go-to recipe for chicken, in fact I believe it's what's on the box of Panko crumbs. :-)

Excellent recipe. My advice is to use the Kikkoman Katsu sauce. Goes excellent with the chicken. You can buy it at an Asian grocery store.

YUM. Delicious exactly as it is written. It tastes just like chicken katsu is intended to taste. Thank you so much for this simple and simply delish recipe! I've added it to my go-to list.

This recipe was great!! I brown then chicken breast on the stove top for the crunch, then finished them off in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. Made some brown rice and mixed veggies and topped with the Katsu sauce.. Family loved it!  Thanks

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it's been simply fantastic. I mix the salt and pepper with the flour before dredging the chicken, and I cook the chicken in a nice big cast iron skillet.

Excellent recipe!  One more modification:  a dash of CAYENNE rubbed on the chicken with the salt and pepper just before coating with flour.

Tried this tonight because I like the Panko Bread Crumbs so much.  I think this is the best fried chicken that I have ever cooked.

I was surprised at how good this was. I usually don't like chicken breast but the chicken was nice and moist. I recall when I was working at a take out place they marinaded the chicken before breading with panko so I was quite surprised at how tasty the katsu was without a marinade. We will try using a deep fryer next time to get the chicken to a nice crisp brown color. Recommend serving right out of the pan/fryer when nice and hot. It tastes best that way.

Not quite sure how to put my finger on it, but it needed a few extra spices on the chicken before dipping it in egg and the crumbs. Cooked it with my darling dearest and we both agreed it took a little getting used to. (It tastes very good with teriyaki sauce, by the way..) Elsewise, it was very good; I plan on cooking it again soon!

This recipe is great. We've been using exactly this recipe for years and it's the best way to entice the kids come over. Their husbands love the dish. We prepare a sauce with mustard, mayonaise and wasabi that works well with the chicken.

Cooked this for the first time today. All of my friends LOVED it. Just make sure you cook your chicken all the way through, and pre-heat the oil like the others say.

Great recipe! It took a couple of tries to make sure I got enough panko crumbs on it to have an even/thick enough coat. I also made a tonkatsu sauce.

PANKO IS LIFE! I would have given this recipe 5-stars but, for me, the cooking time was off. But the chicken came out tender, juicy and nicely flavorful. I used canola oil and added garlic powder and oregano to one side of the chicken along with the salt and pepper (both sides). One weekend when the family is outta town, I'm going to add some cayenne  to the mix and see how it goes. The next time I make it, I'm going to season the panko as well. Absolutely YUMMY!

Pretty easy recipe. I laid out all the ingredients and my husband and 5 year old son put it together. I decided to bake it to save on calories and clean up. I flipped it over when it was 1/2 way done, but it got stuck to the pan (you really don't need to flip it). Since it didn't brown like you would do frying, I turned on the broiler and let the bread crumbs brown. My son gave it 2 thumbs up and my husband said it was better than fried since fried foods gives him a stomach ache. I thought it was pretty good and just as equal as the local Hawaiian restaurant up the street. Ate it with rice and made the tonkatsu sauce on this site. Just was missing the mac salad.

I actually made Tonkatsu and we LOVED it! Instead of seasoning the pork with the salt and pepper, I just seasoned the flour. Made this as written otherwise and was very pleased with the results. DELICIOUS...I can't wait to try this with chicken! Thanks for sharing. :)

My ex used to make this for me all the time served on top of sliced cabbage. The trick to really good katsu, is marinating the chicken in mirin for a couple hours beforehand.

I made this last night, exactly as written, just increased the servings, and it was very good, moist on the inside, crunchy outside, and the panko was not at all greasy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

this has a wounderful crunch factor so dont skip the panko but i would suggest kicking your seasoning way up as this was bland to us. but we will be making it again just using our normal fried chicken spice blend.

I happened to be making chicken katsu but could not find my recipe for ratio of panko and flour so I got on the internet and checked the first recipe (which happened to be this one). If you are not health conscious chicken katsu is best with boneless chicken thighs (with white rice and mac salad).  If you ever go to Hawai'i try a local plate lunch restuarant and you will see what I am talking about!!

Tasted great! Used Japanese style panko bread crumbs from Trader Joe's and it was just perfect. We used a homemade Katsu sauce with it. I would definitely recommend using coconut shrimp sauce with it though.

Good, simple Katsu chicken.  I know some think it's bland but it's great with sauces.  Such as the Japanese curry one I made to go with it (S&B brand Golden Curry from the Asian section of grocery stores).  Served it with sticky white rice and it was almost as good as Wagamama's version!

Amazing!  SO very easy and so very delicious. I did marinate the chicken breasts in chopped Bajan seasoning over night as I do with all my meats but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was very crunchy inside and very moist and tender outside. I used my cast iron and kept the oil on medium heat all the way through. No oil spatters like when doing normal fried chicken!

I tried this recipe a few months ago, it was perfect! i served it with a tonkatsu sauce, even my father loved it and he is very picky with how his chicken is cooked, he even asked when i would make it again. Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!

This was great! Watch out when you put the chicken in the frying oil. Even after laying it down gently, I still got a 2 inch burn on my hand from the oil flying up. I actually prefer this homemade Chicken Katsu rather than the one I get at the Japanese place.

I think I liked this....except for the grease.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I think I'll try baking it.

This was great as is. I tried "Tonkatsu / Katsu Sauce" which tasted good. Then I tasted the chicken with "Wasabi Mayonnaise Sauce" and it tasted even better. Finally, I added "Tonkatsu / Katsu Sauce" and "Wasabi Mayonnaise Sauce" and it tasted great. Served with Sesame Noodles" and "Cucumber Sonomo."

the chicken by itself is really pretty uneventful. it needs a splash of something -- garlic powder, onion powder, even cajun spice. i mixed up some of the recommended sauce, and it gave it the needed flavor. why 4 stars? the husband, who is the pickiest man ever, really liked it, and has asked for it again.

This was a fantastic recipe.  As many other reviewers mentioned, it was slightly bland so I would recommend making a sauce with it.  Also, I added some coconut extract to the egg mixture and that gave it a really nice flavor.  My picky daughter devoured it, so it's definitely a winning recipe in my book!

This was really wonderful, but lacked a bit of flavor. Next time, I'd add some salt to the flour mixture. Served with teriyaki and rice - yum!

Beautiful!  I sliced the chicken instead of pounding it.  Very light, crispy coating!  Need to find a good sauce for it though.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I doubled the recipe.  The only thing I will do differently next time is change the oil if it starts looking too brown.  The chicken looked beautiful and each bite melted in your mouth.  I served this with Tonkatsu (used the recipe for Tonkatsu sauce from "Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce").  The Panko crumbs absolutely make this dish.

This is served all over the place here in Washington state. So I have tasted quite a few spins on the recipe. I used a tablespoon of shredded coconut to the panko, and it was delightful. Also, I would really REALLY suggest using katsu sauce since the chicken itself can be a bit boring.

Excellent!  I found panko at my local Oriental market (the mega-mart didn't carry it).  I added about 2 tsp. of curry powder to the flour, and it was perfection!

This chicken was good - I love panko crumbs for their light non-heavy crunch.  Season the chicken well because it is a bit bland.  These are wonderful on salad greens with a tangy asian inspired dressing.

Very simple and easy recipe.  Turned out crunchy and yummy.  I just bought some Tonkatsu sauce from the store and made some fried rice and it completed the meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, I did use pork instead of chicken. Will try chicken next time and rate again. I used a soy sauce to dip: 1 c sugar, 1/2 c vinegar, 3 T soy sauce, 3 T water, cook low 10 minutes.

My husband is from Japan so we have been making these for years. My kids love it when I make these with chicken tenders.  I buy the pre-cut Gold and Plump Chicken tenders and it makes about 10-12 good size tenders.  Tonkasu sauce is a must when eating these!!

Quick, simple and very tasty.  The chicken stayed moist while the panko coating was perfectly crunchy.  I also noted that the coating did not absorb alot of the oil so it stayed light and crisp without becoming greasy.

A little messy but worth it. Very close to mom's recipe. Husband is a health nut but he devoured this dish. Goes very well with the sauce from the Japanese chicken wings recipe from this site. Would make again.

This was so delicious. I didn't want to stop eating even to have a drink. The sauce from LDYLVBGR is a must. Also, be careful with the heat of the oil as other reviewers have mentioned. I'll definitely share this recipe. So good!

I cut this chicken up into nugget size and let my boys (husband and son) dip it into honey mustard that I also got from this site.  I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and will continue to do so.  It's the boys' favorite!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was introduced to Chicken Katsu at a Japanese restaurant near my home, so I was excited to try this recipe in my own kitchen and my husband I loved it! Better than I've had at any restaurant! This chicken is delicious when paired with the "Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce" from this site. It's also easy to make - you can even make it 2 days ahead of time, so it's ready when you are.

Easy and fast.  It reminds me of the fried chicken you can buy in Japan at the convenience store, a staple of our late night snack runs. This is my boyfriend's favorite dinner. He invented the perfect sauce one day when we ran out of tonkatsu sauce: half barbeque sauce and half A-1. I like to serve it with sushi rice and zuchinni. If I just manage to learn to make inari, our konvini recreation will be complete.

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  Doesn't keep well in the refrigerator though.  I didn't have any chicken breasts, so I used chicken tenderloins instead, still it turned out great.

This is a family friendly meal. I cut the chicken in smaller pieces so they are easy to dip into sweet and sour sauce. I also make a side of rice and cucumber salad.

Taste just like the one at the restaurant.  A little on the plain side but any side dip will take care of that.  Otherwise tastes great.

This chicken was so easy to make. I am living on my own for the first time and needed something simple to start learning how to cook real meals. Well this was it! I agree with others that this was a little bland so do try to work some sort of seasoning or sauce into the recipe.

Was good, just keep your eye on it the panko will burn quickly if you are not careful.

This is so easy and simple!  A definite keeper.  It does need some kind of a sauce though.

This chicken was SOO good!! We all really enjoyed it, even my 22 month old loved it! Super crispy, very tasty and surprisingly moist!! I made only a few changes...Instead of all-purpose flour, I used Tempura Batter Mix and since some  reviews said that the chicken was kind of bland, I put about 1 tsp of garlic salt & 1 tsp pepper in to the beaten egg...YUM! Absolutely PERFECT!  Will definitely be making this again!!

Great recipe, but needs seasonings added to the panko crumbs. My kids loved it, I will be making this again. Thank you!

I'm not a big fan of fried food, but this chicken is excellent.  I used a bit more flour for coating and I forgot to season the chicken (oops!) and it still had a wonderful flavor.  The panko bread crumbs are divine.

My family loved this recipe!  My children couldn't get enough of it and they dove into the leftovers the next day.  I couldn't find the correct bread crumbs in our small town market.  I used regular bread crumbs mixed with corn flake crumbs instead.  I will look for the real deal next time we go into the city!  This will become a part of my monthly meal menu.

I must be the minority; I found this sort of bland. I followed the recipe exactly. The next time I will add more spices to the flour to liven it up. I'm thinking white pepper and, perhaps, a little a dash or two of dry ranch dressing mix ...... just a thought.

My family and my mom really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very simple.  It's a great base, you can add any seasonings you like to suit your taste.  I made chicken tenders.  It's a keeper!
