This is a great recipe.  You can use any fruit you like.  My family likes bananas and strawberries.  I also add a package of vanila pudding.

I prefer fresh blueberries, peaches & raspberries in season, but frozen work fine. Another twist to this recipe is fold one small package of dry jello powder with the cool whip before layering, any flavor you like.  I have used strawberry, very yummy.

I prefer to mix vanilla pudding/custard with either cool whip or real whipped cream.  I layer the angel food cake pieces then the pudding layer, then the fruit.  A trifle bowl makes the layers show up, but you don't need one.  This is better after it sits for awhile, and is better chilled. I make it sometimes from homemade custard made from egg yolks from my backyard chickens, use the egg whites to make homemade angel food cake, and make whipped cream from scratch, and strawberries from the garden.  DELIGHTFUL.

I followed the recipe exactly but also made my own whipped cream. The recipe says 12 servings but I can assure you it fed more than twelve. This was a hit at a family party.

Awesome dessert!  Friends went crazy for it!!  I used strawberries and blueberries for a festive 4th of july effect instead of what was on the recipe.  They were begging to bring the leftovers home!! :)

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit! adults and kids alike were dying for seconds. I used strawberries,blueberries,blackberries,rasberrys and kiwi's. i skipped out on the peaches cause i just didnt like the sound of peaches in a trifle. id never made angel food cake and was worried it was too chewy but the fruit and whipped topping canceled it out and it just melted in your mouth! :D  I'll definitely be making this again for future family events. it was sweet enough for the kids to love but not too sweet for the parents and was the perfect "light" dessert for a BBQ

I often make a Kahlua and brownie trifle but the warm weather called for something lighter and this fit the bill nicely. As with all recipes, it's fun to tweak them adding your own twist and this was no different. As others mentioned, I used a sugar free Cheesecake pudding mix, made per instructions and then folded in most of the whipped topping, saving just a bit for dollops on the top. But I also took some mixed frozen berries and pureed them, pouring some on top of each layer and drizzling on the top for a pretty finish. I think the berry sauce added a lot to the fresh fruit flavor. Thanks for a great base recipe - it was a big hit at a neighborhood BBQ.

Easy, delicious. Great summer recipe. I found after it sat in the fridge for a day or so, it was even better as the cake blends into the cream!

This was AMAZING and oh so perfect on a 100 degree Maryland day!!
I used fresh blueberries, omitted the peaches, and made my own angel food cake (using a Southern Living "Blue Ribbon Angel Food Cake" recipe) and fresh, homemade whipped cream. TO DIE FOR!!!

Family and guests thought this was delicious, but agreed that half the whipped topping would be plenty - so next time I'll use 2 8-oz containers instead.

Huge hit for the 4th of July, just perfect!  I also used only one 12 oz. container of cool whip and it fit in my glass bowl perfectly, so festive. It just disappeared and I had raves from everyone that this is a request for our next event together.

Super easy to put together and I added a small box of jello to the topping to give it some more fruit flavor. Everyone at the pool party loved it and asked for more.

This recipe is amazing!!! I made it for two different father's day parties and it was a huge hit at both. I did follow the substitution of adding cheesecake pudding to the cool whip.

This trifle was a hit with all age groups on Mother's day! To make this a little more diabetes friendly I used fresh fruit and sugar free non dairy frozen topping such as sugar free cool whip. No one even guessed it was sugar free. I used fresh strawberries, blueberries, black berries, and red raspberries. I followed the recipe as written and put it together as stated. I used a trifle dish and it looked very pretty.

A lovely nice light summer dessert.  The longer it sits the better it is.  I blended the strawberries so they would soak in better to the mix.  I did use light whipped topping but will try it with whipped cream also, and with other fruits.  Will definitely make again soon!

Followed directions. Came out perfect. You can decorate inside of bowl with the fruit.  Try to use a high clear bowl.

I did make changes, per the reviews!  I used 2 large containers of frozen strawberries with sugar since they have lots of juice, fresh raspberries, blueberries, a container of cheesecake jello pudding, some whipped cream from a can. People were enthusiastic about it and it kept for days just as good. I really liked the recipe and will use it again!

Absolutely wonderful!  I used fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries and frozen peaches, since peaches are not in season yet in TX.  Served this to guests for dessert last week...a wonderful, light summer offering.  Everyone loved it!

I put it in a trifle bowl and with the layers include graham crackers and strawberry topping.  Finish it off with a drizzle of Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Always a hit.

I will use this again, real easy, lite recipe and it looks nice on table. I used one large container of cool whip, didn't use peaches. For fruit I used all berries (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.  I decorated the top layer with raspeberries and blueberries. It was a hit.
