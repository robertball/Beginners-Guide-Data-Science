I made this recipe and was so impressed with it's texture and taste.  A small bowl filled me up and satisfied me for hours.  I used granny smith apples and couldn't believe the flavor of this soup!  Great source of both fiber and vitamin c!

This recipe calls for no seasoning other than ginger and white pepper, leaving this soup VERY bland if you don't at least add salt.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I sauteed a clove of garlic with the onion, and added salt to taste.  I stirred in a bit of butter before serving, as well, to give it a fuller flavor.  My guests really enjoyed this soup.

This is just an outstanding recipe tho I did have to make some substitutions like with the butter for low fat and such and I did not have fresh ginger so I did use ground. Also I did not have apple cider and so I used pear juice which I did have and as for the yogurt I had vanilla low fat. And the squash I I had a buttercup squash but I tell you I put all that together and it came out the greatest soup. One thing is for sure you really must have the yogurt garnish or it will be bland. Oh, also I did not have white pepper I had a mixture of peppercorns and ground those fresh and used that instead. If you love squash you must try this soup.

I loved this recipe! In response to all those reviews about flavor, just add a teaspoon or so of cinnamon and maybe half or a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg.  You'll be able to smell it when you have the right combo of spices, it will smell like apple pie.

I have been making this recipe for years. I do not find it bland at all and I make it as stated except for adding a little extra ginger. As others have noted it is very filling.

I followed the advice of others to add some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added 2 stalks of celery and 1 carrot, and substituted the water for chicken broth.  I didn't bother adding yogurt at the end because I didn't have any.  I LOVE this soup!  It is so healthy, too!

I used vegetable broth instead of water because of all the comments that it was bland.  I enjoyed it, but I would prefer it more svavory than sweet.  So, next time I will not add the brown sugar and maybe use some milk or cream in place of some of the liquid.

Not a very good recipe!  VERY VERY tasteless!  Disappointed - I tried to doctor it  to make it more tasty but nothing seemed to work and I ended up throwing most of it out.

WAY too bland!!  I was highly disappointed.  I doctered it up with cumin, extra potato, salt and lemon juice to make it actually taste like something.  I had a friend over while I was finishing it up (before the additions) and we both were like, "ehhh, needs something."  Won't keep this recipe, thanks anyway.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I’ve never made it. This afternoon I was cooking my leftover butternut squash on the stove with onion, carrots, and chicken broth. As it was simmering, I browsed through other recipes that contained butternut squash and found this one.  The next thing I knew I was adding apples, ginger, and a pear I had kicking around! I adjusted the liquid with some h20 and seasoned it with salt pepper and sage, let it cook down and pureed it. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you for the idea of adding fruit. I’m excited to see what else I can throw in.

I made as directed except I used ginger powder, about 3/4 of a TBS. The flavor was great, the texture very nice, and not too thick. Will repeat this again for sure.

This was really good, I like the other reviewers added spice. I used my on pumpkin pie spice. I also added garlic and some pumpkin puree that I had in the refrigerator.  I also added yogurt to the soup.  I used 2 c apple cider and 2c water instead of 4c water to cook squash. Soup was excellent, the pumpkin pie spice smelled wonderful!!

Very tasty, although as usual for me I didn't follow the recipe exactly.....and I don't measure anything either.  I was looking for a "sweet" version rather than a spicy or curried soup to match the recipe  I've followed in the past, and just needed a reminder on the spices. I used chicken stock, added a dash of nutmeg, and omitted the potato.  I also subbed half and half for the yogurt.  Very good, it would have been perfect as written too.

I recently started a low sodium diet, and this was the first recipe I tried.  I thought it was good, but as others have stated it's a little bland.  Of course, I'm still adjusting to restricted sodium, so everything seems bland.  Ha!  The yogurt definitely helped.  I'm thinking next time I will add more apples and maybe leave out the potato.

Super healthy, super hearty!  The picture doesn't do it justice.  I did not add apple cider and next time I would add an extra apple.  I also used less ginger and sprinkled a 1/2 tsp to tsp of salt.  

When I served it, I sprinkled cinammon.  It brings out the flavor of apples.  If you are dieting, this is a great recipe to eat and feel full!!!  :-)

I made this on a crisp fall evening for a light dinner.I omitted the potato cause I didn't have any, and used chicken broth instead of water, and added 1/2 t of salt and a T of seasoned rice vinegar.. I blended it in the pot with an immersion blender..no need for additional dirty dishes!Very tasty!

This soup is good.  We wanted it to be a little bit savory so we doubled the white pepper and added garlic, sea salt and garam masala - all to taste.  This gave us just enough savory to compliment the wonderful sweetness and added a hint of spice as well.  Perfection!

Not much deep flavor.  I tried adding more brown sugar and more pepper, but it was still too bland.  I have other squash soup recipes that I prefer.
