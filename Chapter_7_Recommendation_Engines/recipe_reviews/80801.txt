UPDATE: I had this soup two days later for lunch, and it was remarkable (even with my substitutions!) Original:
When I made this soup, my local supermarket was out of endive, so I substituted leeks instead. It turned out brilliantly! I added some more spices though - lots of thyme, sage, rosemary, and cayenne. I also used some white wine and sherry to give it a more sophisticated edge. The only problem I encountered was blending the yogurt into the soup. It didn't blend, and it came out looking like parmesan cheese - Still tasty though! I look forward to trying the recipe with endive soon.

It has a good taste but I followed the directions regarding the yogurt EXACTLY and the yogurt still clumped up.

I had no problem getting the yogurt to mix into the broth smoothly, and it tasted great! I mixed it one ladle at a time. I added tarragon also, which I liked. I think this will be great as a base recipe for just about any veggies or leftovers.

Don't think I would make it again. A little plain.
