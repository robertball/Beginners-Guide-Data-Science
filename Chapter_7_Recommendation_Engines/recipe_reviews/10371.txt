I love oatmeal and sugar cookies, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it.  I let the dough sit in the fridge overnight and then baked the next day.  They taste just like a sugar cookie with oatmeal and are wonderful.

Good tasting cookie.  I used butter instead of shortening, substituted 1/4 cup flax meal for 1/4 flour, used whole wheat for the rest of the flour, did not refrigerate, and baked 2 large cookies at 350 to use as fruit pizza crust.

These are wonderful! I had to use the link to scale the recipe in half because I found to my dismay that I was severly low on flour, but since there's only 2 of us it's not a bad thing.. I still wound up with 16 cookies! I changed nothing except the vanilla- I left that amount the same as in the regular size recipe because I love vanilla. I hate hard-like-cement cookies and these are so far from it. YAY! Thanks for sharing!

Intresting idea, an oatmeal/sugar cookie combo, but unfortunately, the cookies came out pretty dry, though the flavor was nice.  They sort of reminded me of mini scones.

Very good, I will definitely make these cookies again.  Made 40 cookies. I did grease the cookie sheets.  My oven temperature was set at 350°. Didn’t realize until after baking the temperature said 375° in the recipe. Anyway they were perfect. Thanks.

delicious cookies, but they came out too flat for me (most cookies do though) so I made some frosting with powdered sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk and I sandwiched frosting between two cookies. They were delicious- like Little Debbies, but better! :)

This is a great recipe...I have been making these cookies for my family for years.  I believe the previous reviewer baked the cookies too long and that is why they were too hard.  Try these, but do not overbake and you will love them.

What a lovely cookie!  Thank you, Robin.  I looked for an oatmeal cookie that didn't call for brown sugar, because I was out of it - I was out of raisins, too, ;o(.  I did substitute 1/3 cup butter.  Next time I may increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, just because we love cinnamon.  But the cookie turned out nice and crisp - great texture, great taste.  I have some of them in the freezer now.  This will be a standard in our house.

Not the best, but when we had nothing else we thought we could make (living in Santiago, Chile) they worked for a sweet tooth craving.

Very Good... I kept an eye on them so they wouldnt cook too long. Golden around the edges and a nice little crisp when you bite into these not too chewy cookie. My 4 yr old loved it!

These cookies were light and crispy, I might have cooked them at too high of a temperature because the raisins tasted a little burned. Besides that they have a nice flavor and are quick and easy to make. My two year old helped throw the ingredients together.

Mmmmm just pulled these out of the oven, they are Execellent.  I added a touch of nutmeg as well.  I definitely think the secret is not in overcooking.  Mine are just golden around the edges with squigly crack lines running across the top, slightly crispy, but oh so chewy soft once you bite in.  A keeper!

Kid prepared, tested and approved! Using margarine, no extra sugar and spooned immediately onto cookie sheet, and baked for 13 minutes.Another lunch-able nutritious snack.

We didn't have enough butter so we used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. Instead of raisins we used cranberries and didn't refrigerate the dough so they spread quite a bit but kids really enjoyed them. Will definitely make them again!

Delicious cookies- super tasty and have a great texture. I used butter instead of shortening and they were not at all dry. To add more flavor I doubled the vanilla and used cranberries instead of raisins.

These do taste like sugar cookies--more on the sugar cookie spectrum than on the oatmeal cookie spectrum.  they are good and spread a lot, but I did bake at 8 minutes instead of 10 minutes.  I've learned through years of cookie baking to decrease the suggested time by 2 minutes--but I also know my oven.  Some ovens run hot, some run cold, so it helps to know what you are working with.  I don't feel this made a ton of cookies, but it was a decent sized  batch.  Thanks for the recipe.
