First time I made this last Sunday ( 08- 12-2019 ) it was easy to follow, got the timing right, it tasted better after a day of mellowing, will definitely make it again, friends thought it was spot on, for a 76 year gt. grand father it was a good recipe thanks for a good foolproof recipe.

I was looking for something to add to the Snack rotation we take to work.  This is ideal, moist and rich.  Made exactly as the recipe describes, is now a favorite in our house

Cleaning pantry out today and found very very hard dates... and I had  walnuts... searched for a recipe and here it was!
I soaked dates as recipe but for about 2.5 hours, then gave them a rough chop. Followed recipe but doubled quantities and made mix into 4 x 1lb tins. Baked for about 40 mins Turned out great, taste so good and will be even better tomorrow. Flavour reminded me of sticky toffee pudding and I reckon some toffee sauce would go very nicely with a warmed thick slice of this loaf... with ice cream... or cream. Thank you.
