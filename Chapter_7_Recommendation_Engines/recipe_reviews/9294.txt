I pureed 4 peeled over-ripe plums in the  blender instead of using baby food. Added 3 Tablespoons flour and a pinch more baking soda. I didn't use food coloring. I baked them as 2 9x9 square cakes and it tastes just like applesauce spice cake. Very good. Makes an great dessert.

Good recipe. I try to use fresh ingredients when possible, so I didn't bother with the baby food. It's easy to puree fresh plums and add a wee bit of flour. Not much. Cornstarch would also work, or tapioca. About 1 Tablespoon or so. Also, red food coloring is never advised. Just leave that unnecessary ingredient out.
Makes nice little gifts or a great bread to have Christmas morning.

I changed it a little.  I put one and 1/2 cups of plum preserve I made with red plums, and instead of walnuts I chopped up the red plums and mixed them inside the batter.  (I also nixed the red food coloring).  After pouring the batter I spooned several t spoons of the plum preserve on top and swirled in a design.  I nixed the sugar topping because it was sweet with the preserve and a bit tart as well.  I scooped vanilla ice cream on top and it was done.  YUM!

this was great!  i added tea (instead of cloves and nutmeg) to both the frosting/sauce and the batter, which i thought was delicious.  it's best in small doses, though.

UPDATE 2019: It's my MIL's favorite Christmas gift.  No nuts added.  She's requested it every year the last 3 years!


Really moist and great flavor!  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  Used macadamias and almonds.  All the friends who received as gifts were very pleased!!

Kid approved... I made these into muffins, and my kids thought they were great. I did make a few changes. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, and used 1 and 1/2 cups of pureed plums. I also added a cup of oatmeal. We have a lot of plum trees in our yard, so I keep frozen puree in our freezer to make this delicious recipe all winter long.

One of the BEST!!  I have made this countless times using my own canned plum butter and top it off with the Caramel Frosting VI recipe (it's more like a caramel glaze) while the cake is still hot and let it sit in the pan until it's cool (if we can wait that long!).  My mother-in-law RAVES over this combo so I make it for her birthday every year!

Very good!  I followed the cake recipe exactly.  I left off the glaze.  We thought the cake was good as is.  I want to try it again with subbing applesauce for the oil.

This is really yummy and very cakelike.  It would make an excellent homebaked gift for the holidays, and is a lot easier than making a thousand batches of cookies!

This bread is so versatile. When I did not have plums I've used over-ripe mashed bananas with or without softened chopped dates, or I've used regular applesauce and added a packet of unsweetened strawberry Kool-Aid.

I did 2/3 of the recipe and it was just enough batter for a regular 1.5qt bread pan. I also just blended up frozen prune plums instead of the baby food, and it didn't mess up the consistency by making it too watery. The flavor is really nice, I liked the combination with the lemon icing. It also has just the right amount of spices. Definitely a recipe I will refer back to when I feel the need to use up more of my prunes!

I made this last night and brought it to work this morning. It is almost gone at 8AM and the office reviews were "outstanding" I could not find the baby food plum after going to 4 different stores, but I did find baby food "pears and blueberries" together in a 6oz jar which is now my secret ingredient...........I suppose you could use any fruit or combination, but I will keep searching for the plum!
The topping adds a nice zing to it.........

I had lots of leftover plums from a Bountiful Basket. So I peeled and pureed them. I only had fresh clove and nutmeg so I used less then called for so the flavors were not overwhelming. I also left out the food coloring and nuts. I don't have a bunt pan so I used a 9x12 pan and it only took 40 min to cook. Turned out great for my very first, from scratch, cake. I love the lemon icing. I shared it at my office and it went over very well also.

A good bread.  I made two loaves, one with nuts and one without.  The nuts really made the bread a lot better.  Never tried the glaze, the bread started disappearing before I got to it.

Use less sugar (3/4 or 2/3 of amount listed). Use 3/4 amount of cloves. Fresh plumbs (or frozen from prior season) chopped roughly would be good instead of purée plumbs. Can’t taste purée plumbs

This is a good and easy recipe. I did cut oil back to 3/4 of cup. Added 1/2 cups chopped peacan. I left the glaze off. 
I have also made it with apple blueberry , peaches, and sweet potato baby food . 
You can also use can pumpkin and add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.

This is a moist bread cake that everyone loved. If you like the spices in pumpkin pie, you will love this recipe. Raisins would also work if you didn't want the nuts.

Great, simple recipe. Lends itself to many, accommodating changes. Made this with plum compote (not baby food), added about 1/4 cup raisins along with the walnuts. Also dumped the red food coloring. The more fresh ingredients you can use the better - plums, ground nutmeg....

Wonderful aroma. As others have noted, can substitute bananas, (perhaps peaches?) dates and other fruit. Holds up well in many forms - bundt cake, loaves  (large or small) muffins...... Great recipe.

This recipe was a big hit with my family.  I used 3/4 cup of pureed plums from my tree instead of the baby food and  I cut out the red food coloring.  It was already sweet so we ate it without the frosting.  I'm excited to have a new recipe using all the plums we get every summer.  Next year I"ll puree plums, freeze them, and have them on hand for this recipe.

I've made this once as as a bread and once as muffins (more like cupcakes).  I think I preferred the bread but both were good.  For the muffins I baked at the same temp but for 27-28 minutes.  I wasn't sure if I should grease and flour the muffin tin like I did the bundt pan so I did some that way and some with muffin tin liners, the liners worked better.  Good way to use up an excess of plums from the csa.

Everyone I made this cake cor loves it!  I did change a couple of things, Instead of Baby Food I used a full 12 oz can of Solo Prune Plum Cake and Pastry filling and did not add any food coloring!    I also made a batch with Solo Apricot cake and pastry filling!  It was not fruity enough but was very good also!  More like a Spice cake than an Apricot cake ;)

I really didn't like this recipe.  I followed recipe exactly, except that i substituted real plums for plum baby food, and i omitted the nuts.  This recipe didn't have much flavor, and where it did, the flavors didn't work.  It's too bad. I was really looking forward to it.

I am sitting here trying to restrain myself from eating it all :(. While this recipe was tasty, I have to agree that you can't actually taste the plums. I made a couple of changes to this recipe out of necessity. I used sunflower oil instead of vegetable and I used 8 oz of fresh peeled black plums instead of baby food. I squashed them up in my hands and removed pits (no need for making the food processor dirty). I also used 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup raisins by choice. It turned out really well. I almost forgot the icing but I'm glad I didn't :). I used a two-piece angel food tube pan for the recipe because I don't own a bundt pan. It worked.

So good! I made this twice - once I peeled and pureed 12 plums for a double recipe, the second time I simply squashed 12 plums in my hand and took the pits out. Both times it was delicious, and it's less work not peeling them. I also was worried that 1 tsp. of cloves would be too much, but it was perfect, and I don't usually like cloves. We had an abundance of plums, and I've made several desserts with them, but this was everyone's favorite. I've been asked for the recipe over and over again. I think I will give loaves of this out as Christmas gifts. The glaze really makes it, don't skip it!

I made this for a holiday party and everyone loved it!  The brushed on lemon glaze added a nice tangy crust I'd be tempted to use on other cakes as well.

I decided to leave out the red food coloring, and I couldn't find plum baby food, so I used baby prunes instead.

This is a very tasty fresh fruity cake. I used fresh pureed plums and I mixed all the wet ingredients in the blender. I forgot to add the ground cloves so instead put a bit of ginger in. I loved the outcome and it baked very nicely. Super moist!

I was a little hesitant at first with the baby food.  But it was delicious!  No plum baby food so I replaced it with Apples with Plums.  When I got home I realized I bought half Apples with Plums and half Apples with Blueberries so I mixed them all.  Turned out great anyways!

This was an okay recipe.  The flavor was good and very moist but I thought it would have more of a plum taste.  Probably will not make again.

This recipe was just okay to me.  I gave mini loaves as gifts and I received some compliments.
