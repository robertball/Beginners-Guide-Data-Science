Made with just ham & did in small size as appetizer. Still tool 1 1/2 hr to cook and tasted better as they cooled/set.

I grind up some extra ham steaks for this recipe.  I have also used half and half ground turkey as well.  I blended it in the food processor with the ham.  It works wonderfully.  I make extra sauce because my family enjoys pouring it over mashed potatoes!

Had my doubts while putting this together, but it tasted great! I was worried about the 2/3 cup vinegar ruining the whole recipe, but I went ahead & followed the sauce recipe to a "T" and it was delish! Wouldn't change a thing & will make it again.

A bit too sweet for me, but my family liked it.

My teenagers beg for this.  I've made them larger for dinner, and smaller for cocktail meatballs, and everyone loves them.  Making them for the Super Bowl party this year.
