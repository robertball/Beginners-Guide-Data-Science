This might not have plain mayo but it does have Ranch dressing, which has mayo - or at least it should be made with mayonnaise.  This would probably be better made with home made Ranch dressing but the bottled dressing just didn't taste very good in this pasta salad.

This is almost exactly the way I make my pasta salad.  I only use Italian dressing (not a fan of ranch)  I also add cubed ham or chunks of kielbasa.  Also add chunks of cheese.  Usually whatever I have on hand.  I like a white and a yellow for the taste and color.  Always gets raves.

I loved it... I changed up though cause I'm scared of tomatoes. I used the cucumber, sliced pepperoni, and olives... it was awesome oh I also used fresh grated parmesean cheese.

I just made this and am letting it "blend" a little before serving. I'm not a big fan of sour, and Italian dressing has a little too much bite for me, so I did the Ranch/Italian blend as in the recipe. It's perfect for me. I like this recipe because it is so versatile. I can see using this dressing always in my pasta and other salads.

I just didn't like the combo of Italian & Ranch dressings. It just wasn't for us.

This is almost like one we make all the time, and everyone loves it, but we only use zesty Italian dressing, tri color spiral pasta with cucumbers, olives, tomatoes, and sliced and diced chicken or turkey breast, can use lunch meat, just be sure itâ€™s the real stuff you can see the grain in, not the plastic:)

I made this for the fourth of July family picnic. My husband was hoping for left overs so he could have some more at home. Guess I'm making more, because there wasn't any left. The only thing I did was add a little No Salt.

I just can't decide about this.  For starts I will not be putting cucumber in it again.  It took over the salad.  I used Fat Free Hidden Valley Ranch and Lite Olive Garden Italian Dressings.  I did not sue as much as was called for.  That would have been a waste of money.  Maybe my review will change if I make it again without the cucumbers.  It just made it taste odd. The family said it was good but it wasn't something they raved about.  Just good.  It needs improving.

I did not like the ranch in this.  I think it would've been much better with only the Italian dressing.  I would make it again- without the ranch!  Otherwise it was super easy!  I also added black olives!

I just made this for my company picnic and it was a hit!  I plan on making this again - perhaps adding garbanzo beans. I wasn't sure what the combination of Italian and Ranch would taste like but I like it - a new favorite!  Great recipe!

I made this for my mom to take to her PTA pasta fest. She came back with a ridiculous amount of leftovers. I didn't try it myself but it clearly did get the job done

Excellent and easy.  I substituted spaghetti for the rotini because I had leftover spaghetti to use and scaled everything down to match the amount of pasta I had to work with.
