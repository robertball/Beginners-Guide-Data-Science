We had a "dip party" at work today, so yesterday I scanned this site for fruit dip recipes. I made this recipe, one that is exactly the same, but with orange juice instead of cherry juice, and one with sweetened condensed milk instead of the marshmallow creme and with lemon juice.  By far, the cherry was the most flavorful and most attractive.  The orange was a nice alternative, but the lemon left a lot to be desired.  In the future, I will use the cream cheese and marshmallow creme as a base and simply try different juices.  I used the actual fruits (cherries, an orange slice, and a lemon slice) to adorn the dip so that the party-goers knew what flavor they were dipping their fruits into.  This is also a great recipe to have one's children help make. Oh, and warming the cream cheese and the marshmallow creme before mixing made all the difference.  Enjoy!

I am truly not a fruit dip fan but I wanted to come up with some new ideas to add pizazz to my sons lunchbox.  I halved the recipe thinking he would probably just nibble on it and not really make a dent in the concotion.  Can I be the first day say I pretty much consumed the whole batch myself and sent my son off to school with a little container of it.  This stuff was SO delicious.  I had mine with strawberries and my son had his with apples.  I had to add a lot more of the cherry syrup because I wanted the pinkish color and a slight cherry flavor. This was a hit with my family!  Especially with me for its easy prep and delicious results!  Thank you so much Natalie!!

Sinfully delicious!  A great excuse to eat Fluff!  I added a container of raspberry yogurt since I didn't have cherry juice. I also whipped the cream cheese in my mixer and heated the marshmallow alone for 20 seconds in the microwave.  Then poured it into the mixer too.  I couldn't see heating the cream cheese.

DELISH!  I tried 3 different fruit dips and this was the favorite.  I did add a few drops of red food coloring to make a nice pink color.  It is very sweet.  We ate it room temperature and after it was in the fridge.  I think I like it better cold but either way its very good with fresh fruit and/or pound cake.

This recipe helped my kids get started. They wanted to try and make something to surprise me one day and remembered I had made fruit dip last summer. My son knew I had looked on the Internet for recipes and found your Web page. He copied it down and immediately started to make it. After taste-testing it, he stated that something was missing. He added a container of Cool Whip! Though they had good intentions of making this a surprise for Mom, it was almost gone before I could taste any! This is a great way to get fussy teens to eat fruit! I got to lick the bowl!! Thanks for the recipe.

This is an easy and great tasting recipe to make. I use to buy the already made fruit dips in the grocery store but not anymore. This one's a keeper!

This is great "Stuff".  It is Super Bowl Sunday and I made the fruit dip early so it would have time to chill.  And like any over grown kid I ran my finger in the bowl (just to taste) and was amazed at how great it is.  Thank you for a recipe that is easy and taste wonderful!

This is a wonderful dip.  The cream cheese takes away the super sweetness of the marshmellow creme, but is still sweet enough to be great.  I have made it without the cherry juice, and it is still delicious over fresh fruit.

tablespoons of grenadine.

As is this recipe is easy and delicious!  To change the flavor a little, on my second attempt at making this, I added 4 pureed maraschino cherries and 2 tbsp. of raspberry puree!  So, so good!

As written, this was just OK for me. I  tried it after I mixed it up and I thought it was too sweet and a little flat. I added some vanilla yogurt to cut the sweetness and a couple tablespoons of OJ concentrate to add some depth of flavor. It was delicious after that!

You can sub in two tablespoons of orange juice concentrate for the cherry juice, which gives this dip a nice flavor.

This is one recipe that tastes so much better the next day so make it a day or two ahead of time. Its a great dip to get your kids to eat fruits.  I used light cream cheese and give them a few teaspoons of it with a cut up fruit.

This dip was delicious with fresh fruit!  We had family over for a BBQ and served the fresh fruit with the dip for dessert.  Makes a nice dessert that isn't too heavy.  It makes a lot.  I added a lot more cherry juice than stated because it barely even made it pink.  Next time I'll add a bit of red food coloring.

Very sweet fruit dip, I wanted to make it less thick and not quite so sweet, I added plain low fat yogert. Wonderful! Exactly what I was looking for.

Everyone in my family absolutely loves this dip.  I let the cream cheese sit out on the counter until it softens. Using a stand mixer really blends the ingredients well.  I always add more cherry juice to make the color brighter and give it more of a cherry flavor.

I've made this recipe several times. I've made as is and also used strawberry cream cheese. It is the most amazing fruit dip you'll ever make.  Always a winner!

This was very good and hit with everyone at our house.  I also tried a half and half mix of cream cheese and marshmallow.  This was also a hit and most couldn't tell the difference the ones who could preferred the half and half mix.

Very good, and that's warm before we chilled it! I screwed up and used too much cream cheese (2 blocks), but it doesn't seem to matter, it's still really sweet.  Cant wait til tomorrow's cookout, I think everyone will love this one! Thank you!

This is a great dip.  I made exactly as stated and decided to add a little more cherry juice to bring out the flavor a little more.  I also took some and added a splash of almond extract and I thought that made it even better.  I served it with sliced apples and strawberries.

This was a huge hit at my daughter's 4th birthday party this weekend.  I did use orange juice instead of the recommended, but everyone just raved about it.  Almost every person at the party has already asked for the recipe for it.

This is available whenever I buy my weekly fruit.  Kid's love it.  Added a little green food coloring for alien dip.  The marishino juice is great as well.  We also like it plain.  Great addition to make fuit more appealing to the kids!  Thanks

Quick, easy and delicious.  I added a little more (about 1 more tbl) cherry juice to make it a little more favorful.  It is especially great with oranges!

This was okay. Definitely simple but I was looking for a fluffier fruit dip. We'll eat it but I probably won't make it again.

I made it with 7 ounces of marshmallow creme (instead of the 16) and it was very tasty.  It's going in my "keep" binder for sure.

Was very easy to make, although a bit to sweet for me.  I used strawberry cream cheese - next time I would try plain cream cheese, less Marshmallow cream, and try the cherry juice.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this. I thought it was too sweet, so next time I will not use as much marshmallow. Mine did not come out very pink, so next time I will also use a bit of pink food coloring paste. Thank you for the recipe.

This is really good! I would add a little more cherry juice though. The cherry juice taste didn't come through enough for me with just the 1 Tbs. It still was good though!
