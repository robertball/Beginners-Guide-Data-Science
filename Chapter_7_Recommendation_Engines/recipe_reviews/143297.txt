I love this recipe.  I make it instead of the old-fashioned salad to accompany down home or caribbean fare.  Instead of white I use apple cidar vinegar. ( If youa re not a curry fan it can be omitted)

I really like this recipe, the only thing I did differently was to add eggs.

I nuked the spuds and sweet potatoes.  This might have been a mistake, as the sweets were very mushy.  It ended up like diced spuds in a sweet potato-dressing matrix.  I added diced red pepper and defrosted sweet peas to add more color & crunch.  I also added a bit of ground cumin and a dash of cinnamon to the dressing.  It looked odd, but it was tasty.

I have made his recipe at least 8 times.
It is a hit every single time I make it.
I'm always asked for the recipe.
I added chopped red pepper the last time I made
this instead of celery, because I didn't have
celery on had. It was still perfect.
As most potato salads, it is always better the next day.
The blend of cilantro, lemon, and curry is divine.

Did not change a thing when making this. We did not really enjoy the this. The flavors did not come together in a good way. Probably will not make again.

Good, but I felt it could've used a little spice. Next time I might add either some cayenne, or some chopped jalapeno. For the record, sweet potatoes looked a LOT better than the potatoes in this salad. Just use all sweet potatoes instead!

Love it , love it. The only changes I made: added a bit of cinnamon to the potato mix and a few squirts of agave nectar to the dressing. The flavors are amazing! Will definitely make it again.

This is definitely a keeper!  The only change I made was to add salt to the boiling water when I cooked the potatoes.  Great recipe.
