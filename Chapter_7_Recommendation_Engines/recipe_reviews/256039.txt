No heat, just oil. Not very good. Too little macaroni,  too much cheese

Wow! Absolutely delicious recipe! Added a clove of garlic and puréed that with the Anaheim chilies. Also used Colby Jack cheese instead of pepper jack. Added about a tablespoon of chili powder but I don’t think it needed. Wonderful dish and will make again for Thanksgiving! Decadent, flavorful and cheesy!

This was absolutely delicious!!! I made this for a  party so I went little light on the pepper jack but it still had nice heat. Will definitely make again!

Neither of us are big fans of mac and cheese but this was delicious and my kind of mac and cheese. Three things. It doesn't make a whole lot so you'll want to double  if feeding very many. The other thing is that is takes quite a bit of  oil to get the peppers into a paste so plan on that. Lastly, it is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it! For kiddo's maybe not but for the adults, make this and make it right now!
