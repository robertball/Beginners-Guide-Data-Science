I baked these in a 425 degree oven rather than frying them... and I left out the sauce... but my family LOVED them! I made them about a month ago, and am going to make them again tonight! Thank you so much!!! :)

AWESOME!!!!!Just like my Mom makes.we loved it! The only changes I made were that I did not have coriader, but I used a teaspoon of Dijon mustard, and I had Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  Otherwise I followed it exactly.  Thank you soooo much.

The meatballs were very flavorful.  I used dijon mustard instead of coriander and added about 1/3 cup of sour cream to the mushroom soup.  It was delish!  Husband liked it too!

I'm a new wife and made these for my husband over noodles.  He asked me where I bought the meatballs.  When I said I made them, He gave me a high five across the table.  I made a smaller version of the recipe for the 2 of us, but they were still wonderful.  I browned them in a frying pan, but then put them in a small casserole dish, added the soup, and them left them in the oven for a few hours on low.  Still wonderful!

WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!  I’ve only made meatballs a couple times in the past 15 years of marriage, mostly because *I* don’t like them even though it is one of hubby’s favorite meals.  I wanted to make a special meal for him and I tried this recipe.  The meatballs turned out great; I even ate 2 of them.  The only real difference was I made ours with ground venison (we have a lot of it in the freezer this time of year).

These are very satisfying and easy to prepare. Just watch them carefully when you're cooking them in the covered pot as they will burn easily. Once I turned my heat down and got them to brown instead of burn I had a winner! They are a little crispy on the outside and cooked through on the inside. Savory and delicious. I skipped the white sauce/cream soup and served them with spagetti noodles and marinera sauce.

The meatballs seemed a little on the nutmeggy side to me (and I even added a bit less than called for).  But I think once you add sour cream to the soup (as someone helpfully suggested already), the flavors even out. Perhaps the title subconsciously conjured up my kindergarten imaginings of big sloppy italian meatballs all covered with cheese, rather than a more swedish-meatball-type of flavor.  Thanks anyway :)

I found these meatballs to be quite tasty-in a different sort of way. I'm glad I only put 1/2 tsp of the nutmeg, though, as someone suggested. I didn't have the mushroom soup, so I just made a white sauce and cooked it for a few minutes with the meatballs, which flavored the sauce just right. My husband put catchup on them, so I made him eat some just as they were so that he could help me rate the recipe. He gave a thumbs-up, so that probably means 5-stars!

This recipe is 5 star worthy with a few modifications. I didn't have coriander so I added about a tbsp of fresh lemon juice. Also added about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and about 1 tbsp of minced garlic to the onions. For the cream of mushroom sauce I made my own soup (using Dianne's recipe which is Amazing). I added several splashes of red wine to the sauce and also about 1/3 cup sour cream. We will definetly be making this one again and soon! Thanks for the recipe:)

We had a big crowd to feed tonight so I doubled the meatballs (with only a pinch of nutmeg and added a splash of cream) and tripled the sauce. Sauted the onions until tender and set aside. Sauted approx. 12 oz. sliced button mushrooms in small amount of butter in same pan until dry, added a splash of white wine and continued to cook until all liquid evaporated and set the mushrooms aside. Put the soup in the pan and added milk (to desired consistancy)instead of water and added about 1/4 cup of beef stock. Returned the meatballs to the sauce and simmered until the rest of dinner was ready. Served over wide egg noddles with corn and dinner rolls. Everyone loved these meatballs and asked that they be added to the rotation. This is a very easy recipe with exceptional results. Thank you for sharing!

Mmm... comfort food. This was so easy to put together. I loved the simplicity of the sauce. The meatballs were great too, just felt as though they could've been better. Maybe it was the lack of coriander (I didn't have any on hand). Thanks for the recipe!

Holy COW, these meatballs are awesome! I can't imagine letting one fall off the table. I doubled the recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley, so substituted 1 tsp dry for the 1 Tbsp fresh. Made this with the egg noodles. Great choice! My husband took a bite of the meatballs and said WOW! Which is a HUGE compliment coming from him. I will DEFINITELY make these again.

Made it as written, but I added 2 cups of beef gravy to the final stir. Serving it over mashed potatoes I thought it needed a bit more sauce.

I'm giving this four stars based on my 8 year old son's review of these meatballs...he loved them.  My husband would give this a 3.5 if he could give a half rating.  I'd have to agree.  The nutmeg flavor in these is just too strong, in my humble opinion...too strong for a meatball.  However...all is not lost...I plan on trying to make a stroganoff meatball next time using this recipe as a basis.  (And I will completely eliminate the nutmeg, but double up on the onion).  Thanks.  :)

My husband liked this recipe but I halved the nutmeg and tripled the gravy. I still thought it was terrible and the nutmeg overpowering. I didn't finish what was on my plate. =( It looked so good too!

My mom made this recipe growing up and it is my all-time favorite meal, served over mashed potatoes.  I like gravy so I always use two cans of soup, and our recipe doesn't use nutmeg.  I'll have to try baking the meatballs, since you do have to be attentive turning the meatballs as they brown on the stove top.

I was looking for a recipe for swedish type meatballs to serve with noodles and this is the one! I prepared a day ahead so that I could reheat for dinner the next night and this worked fine.  I used the nutmeg as called for in the recipe and quite liked it.  I subbed dried parsley for fresh as I didn't have any and I used golden mushroom soup.  I also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream and a little worchestershire sauce to the sauce/gravy.....a little extra water too as I was really trying to stretch the sauce.  I will definitely make this again and I will double the sauce next time.  Very good recipe!

I thought this recipe was amazing, I changed a few things I only added half the nutmeg, I added dry mustard powder and the corriander, I added a tbs. of soya sauce, I added about a tbs. of parmesean cheese, I added Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. For the sauce I used 2 cans of mushroom soup and added half can of water half a can of milk so the sauce wasnt as thick but it still thickened up, I baked my meatballs in the oven instead of frying them and added the sauce on top and baked until it was bubbly...I served it over egg noodles and it was amazing!!

Entire family loved this - my toddler asked for seconds which is unheard of!  My husband does not like coriander, and I didn't have nutmeg on hand, so I used another poster's suggestion and substituted with stoneground mustard.  We are an anti-mushroom family, so used cream of celery instead, and added 1/3 cup no-fat sour cream to thicken it up.  Browned the meatballs for 5 minutes or so, then put them in a casserole dish, poured the sauce overtop and baked at 350 degrees for a little over an hour.  Served the meatballs and sauce over egg noodles.  Thank you for a great recipe that everyone loved!

We all loved it and oh my gravy!  they smelled so good when they were cooking.  I baked them on 400 for about 20 minutes and them turned them over.  I didn't have all the spices, but I used italian bread crumbs and I think that made up that.  I also added about 1 cup of minute rice.  It helps suck up the extra grease from the not-so-lean beef.  I made a gravy w/ the can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 packets of brown gravy mix and 1 1/2 c. of water.  And then served it over egg noodles.  I will definately make these again.  They didn't take long to form and since I baked them, they were pretty low maintenance since they were baked.

I added just a little white wine to deglaze before adding the soup.  Delicious.  I did use pre-cooked (frozen) meatballs for a quick dinner, and served over roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Excellent, thanks for the post.

I used one cup of crumbled up corn chex instead of bread crumbs and horseradish mustard instead of coriander. Found it to be most excellent.

I wasn't expecting much but WOW, was I impressed.  I didn't use Coriander, not a fan but I used 1 tsp of dijon like others suggested and much less nutmeg.  I did leave the drippings from the meatballs in the pan when I added the Cream of Mushroom.  I added about 2 tbs of sour cream.   This was delicious and I will make it again.  The meatballs were so moist.

This has great potential with some modifications. Seasoned bread crumbs add an additional light flavour, using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt reduced sodium and gives it a more "fresh" taste, one tablespoon of dried parsley is just as good as the fresh in a pinch, nutmeg is a strong spice so it should be used lightly (I recommend half a teaspoon or a little less than that for the amount of meat in this recipe). Also, one can of the soup isn't enough to make a creamy sauce. This sauce would fair better with two cans of soup, half-one can equal amounts red wine and water, as well as some additional sauteed mushrooms. Onto the cooking method... I chose to make them at 400F for 10-15 minutes, flipped them over and then cooked another 10-15 minutes. Whisked together the ingredients for the sauce and poured it over the meatballs after they were nicely cooked; placed the pan back in the oven and cooked it until the sauce bubbled. Tossed everything over egg noodles and it was a nice meal. As previously mentioned, more sauce is necessary to coat the dish sufficiently. Pairs well with a crisp, green salad.

A good easy recipe. Hubby doesn't like "creamy" gravies so I made a simple brown gravy. It tasted excellent over mashed potatoes.

I was surprised at how good this dish tasted! At first I was a little skeptical of the fact that there is no salt in the meatballs directly, but they turned out very well. I made them bigger and browned them in olive oil, then took them out and made the sauce; I then returned the meatballs to the sauce and let them simmer until done. I also added some sour cream to the sauce in the very end and I thought that that was a very good addition- just added a little extra punch. My husband kept saying how good these were and told me to make them again soon! Thank you for the recipe :)

Very good! I baked it at 425 for 15 min as was recommended earlier by another member and threw in some cumin and a few other spices to my personal liking it was really good. Wasn't greasy at all which is what usually happens when I fry it. Didn't burn either. Great recipe for busy moms and dads!

Hubby is allergic to cilantro and coriander so I omitted it.  Used garlic and onion powder, did milk to my desired consistency and omitted the water.  The result was two children asking for thirds and when daddy came home they helped themselves to his dinner as well.  Definitely making again!  Made it over my mushroom rice recipe as I didn't want to run to the store and get noodles.

Not sure why everyone is raving about these meatballs.  I found them to be very dry and tasteless.  There is way too much bread crumbs.  They have the potential to be good meatballs with some tweaking.

I was disappointed of this recipe after reading the rave reviews... I used some leftover meat needed to cook up and maybe it wasn't a full pound because these meatballs were VERY dry.  My husband said they were fine but I couldn't finish mine.  The flavor seemed nice (I only put about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg spice and there was a nice sweet flavor about them) but I wouldn't make it again without adding more egg or less breadcrumbs or something.  I used very finely ground breadcrumbs, so that may have been the problem.

Exquisite Swedish meatball recipe.  I did not change anything about the meatball recipe.  I did add sour cream 1/3 cup, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved it.  Oh and I baked them at 425 for 23 min.  I have horrible luck panfrying meatballs.  My 8 yr old son Jordan loved them.  I made two batches one with onions one without and doubled the sauce.  Served with buttered parsley egg noodles and croissants.

I found my meatballs to have way too much breadcrumbs, next time I think I will only use 3/4 cup.  I also only used 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and used the full tsp of coriander.  I had to add a splash of milk because of the breadcrumbs.  Other than that they smelled awesome while I baked them, 425 oven for 18 min.  They tasted bland coming out of the oven, maybe more garlic and onion.  Once in the sauce they moistened up a bit, so it's not that I hated the recipe it is just I was really looking for a flavourful meatball before the sauce.  Also with the sauce I added mini bella mushrooms sauted in butter, garlic and white wine.  I added 2 cans of soup, a half can of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I served over egg noodles.  I will make this again, but with the same changes.

The flavor was great!  I made it "as is" but it came out a little dry. I made over rice, but didn't have enough of the "sauce" to drizzle over the rice.  I'll make it again.

Awesome! Very yummy meatballs. I like many others used the dijon mustard instead of the coriander. I also added beef stock to my mushroom soup to thin it down. Otherwise I followed it exactly and they are great.

This is an excellent meatball/with gravy recipe. The second time I made these, I used 2 cans of mushroom soup for more gravy and added 1 tsp beef granules for a richer gravy. This is a keeper recipe. Thanks!

This was superb!  I did modify to include 1/2 cup sour cream in the sauce and eliminated 1/2 cup water.  Added a 1/2 tsp of tarragon and a can of mushrooms.  I did use brown/spicy mustard instead of coriander too. I also served this over spaghetti squash and this was an awesome dinner!  thank you for the recipe.

I had 3 pounds of hamburger, so I made it all into meatballs. I made a mess, trying to cook these in a frying pan, so I baked the rest in the oven on a broiler at 350º. 
I now have enough for 2 more meals in the freezer. These will work with spaghetti, other soups, or in sandwiches. 
Four hard to please adults said 'yummy'.

DELISH!  This dish will be a regular at our house.  (I did use some dijon mustard).  As much as I love Spaghetti & Meatballs.....this was a welcome change.
...guess we all have different taste buds, but I can't imagine anyone NOT loving these.  Thanks for the recipe.
Ours didn't have a chance to 'fall off the table' they were gobbled down so quickly!  Adorable name for the recipe! :)

I didn't have the corriander and decided against the nutmeg (not a fan of the spice), and sauted fresh sliced mushrooms with the balls.  The balls held together terrific, and the kids loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

Currently, my husband and I are on the South Beach Diet, phase 1. I did not change anything in this recipe except I omitted the bread crumbs. These were fantastic and had such a great, different flavor. I served it with salad and mixed green beans in with the cream of mushroom soup. Delish! Thanks for the recipe.

5-star for my family! These were easy to make and not a single thing left over! GREAT flavor!! My 1 and 2 yr old ate every bite! My husband skipped the gravy and dipped in spicy A-1 (with Tabasco added)...mmm, think I might add a dash or two to the mix next time for even more flavor! Thanks for sharing such a simple and delicious recipe!!!!

Delicious!  The family loved these meatballs served over smashed potatoes.  Too bad there wasn't more gravy!  I used Amy's organic mushroom soup and added some sour cream.  I did also substitute freshly ground and toasted oats for the bread crumbs because that is what I had available. Overall, excellent!

Very flavorful meatballs! I used ground turkey and chose to stuff them with swiss cheese and mushrooms so left out the egg and breadcrumbs so it would be easier to handle.  For the sauce, I used the can of cream of chicken soup, 1 1/4 cups sour cream, 1/2-3/4 cup milk, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, salt, parsley and 1/3 cup white wine.  Really delicious!  I'll make them again with the egg and bread crumb.  They're kind of like swedish meatballs.

you guys just made me look like a gourmet chef! thank you for sharing this. I never would have imagined this combo. I didn't have coriander so Alexa told me to use cumin. I also made mine on the smaller side so they only took about 10 min to cook. incredible flavor! I put my parsley sprinkled over the top as a finish instead of in the mix. I also added mushrooms sauteed before I put the soup in and added enough half and half to make my consistency.

If I could give this 20 stars, I would! This meatball recipe is my go- to for spaghetti and meatballs. I use a mixture of ground venison and pork.  Just be cautious not to over mix and take your time while cooking them. It seems to a little time consuming to make homemade meatballs after a long day at work but it's worth it!

Excellent! My husband doesn't usually like meat with nutmeg but he liked these a lot. They are going in the recipe box!
Next time I will either add more sour cream to the gravy or another can of mushroom soup.
I might make this into a casserole next time too.
Changes I made:
- pan-fried the outside then put in the oven at 425 to 130°
- added sour cream to the gravy
- added allspice and a couple green onions to meatballs
- substituted dry mustard because I didn't have coriander

I got 14 meatballs out of this, each about the size of a large walnut.  

The family liked this dish. The combination of spices is unusual but variety is good. The only change I made to the ingredients was I used three cans of soup, I'd rather have too much "sauce" available than too little. Also, as another reviewer suggested, I baked the meatballs at 425 for 30 minutes. This was too long for my meatballs and if I were to do it again I'd bump it down to about 23 minutes.  

I served them over egg noodles. It was a nice looking and pleasant dish.

There wasn't enough of the gravy, it was quite dry. I like the suggestion of adding some sour cream, I will do that next time. I didn't have nutmeg so I used allspice. Probably should buy some for the next time. There was a taste missing and the nutmeg may have been it. I had a hard time forming my meatballs, they were rather dry. Maybe need two eggs next time or cut down the bread crumbs to half a cup. Would have appreciated a recommendation of how many ounces of noodles to use.

The meatballs are wonderful but we felt like the sauce was lacking. I ended up adding an additional can of golden mushroom soup and a dash of worsh. sauce. We really enjoyed it with that modification. I also served over egg noodles.

This recipe is a good start but I feel needs a little work. I wil try making these again but I would only put 1/4 of the numeg called for. I am not a HUGE nutmeg fan, I believe it can add a lot to a recipe and can also be unforgiving if to much is added. Thanx for the recipe I will try them again with a few changes

I made these meatballs last night.  I definitely liked the nutmeg in them but it lacked something else.  There wasn't much else in flavor.  Maybe they just need garlic, I don't know.  We just didn't care for them too much

I didn't have time to saute the onions so I threw them in raw. I cut back on the nutmeg (not a huge fan) and omitted the parsley (hate it). The meatballs turned out a bit dense and stodgy but  that was my fault for being heavy-handed with the mixing/rolling. This was a decent meal, but I think I prefer meatballs in a tomato/marinara sauce.  Thanks though!

These were good. The coriander and nutmeg add an interesting sweet flavor to the meatballs. Hubby and I both felt like they were missing salt. I used minced garlic rather than garlic salt, and didn't want to add too much salt since condensed soups are known for being salty. I'll make these again though, I'll just add a bit more salt. I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, some milk and a little sour cream for the sauce. We'll have this again, and hopefully the baby will fell well enough to try it.

Awsome recipe.. the only thing I did different was to use half ground turkey and half lean ground beef, parmesan bread crumbs, a little bit of cayenne pepper and a ton more garlic.  I baked instead of cooking them in a pan because I doubled the recipe and they wouldn't fit in the pan. I made a pan full of HUGE meatballs and my boyfriend literally ate almost the entire thing.. no joke.  I served over mashed potatos with peas.  Good comfort food.

These meatballs were amazing.  I followed the exact recipe, and the only reason I give it 4 stars was because of the sauce.  I thought it was a little thick, and could use a little improving, but it was terrific.

I followed this exactly as written and it turned out great.  I used a cookie scoop to form the meatballs and served it over egg noodles.  My two boys, 6yrs and 2.5yrs, have never been so quiet at dinner.  Excellent!

I loved this recipe!! It was such a hit with the whole family. Instead of coriander I added honey mustard and the recipe said to add one can of cream of mushroom but I did too to have more sauce for the noodles. Once you try this recipe you will never make meatballs any other way! DELICIOUS!!!

I am a nutmeg lover, but thought it gave the meatballs a strange taste when combined with the cream of mushroom soup.  I'll stick with my old meatball recipe.

Thsi recipe was very easy and quick.  I should have baked the meatballs as the other reviewers suggested, and I also used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, but I could still taste it, and really didn't care for it.  I added Worcestershire sauce, also. Otherwise, the meatballs were good and my husband and two year old had seconds.

The meatballs are absolutely delicious. I would give them 5 stars but i couldn't believe that a meatball with this much flavor would be teamed with cream of mushroom soup. I made a cheaters potato soup by blending a can of sliced new potatos with juice a few creams and seasonings then mixed in the meatballs bowtie pasta and sweet peas and it was perfect!

Made exactly to recipe.  Kids liked, husband said it was so-so, I hated.  I am a meatball snob though.  I thought the gravy of plain canned mushroom soup was bland.
