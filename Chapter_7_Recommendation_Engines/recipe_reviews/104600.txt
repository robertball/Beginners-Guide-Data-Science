This is a simple and fuss-free way of cooking chicken wings. All the marinating ingredients can be found in most kitchens. The result is very tasty too! I substituted white wine for the rice wine and used 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of half a cup. I also used a little corn starch to thicken the gravy at the end.

I was looking for an Asian inspired recipe for wings, and chose this because I had all the ingredients on hand. I decided to change the preparation mainly because I think marinating provides a deeper flavor. I started with almost 3 pounds of wings(tips removed) and placed them in zip-lock bag. I mixed the sauce ingredients in the amounts stated (plenty) and mixed into the wings. Refrigerated overnite. Preheat oven to 425. Cover shallow baking pan with foil and coat with cooking spray. Drain marinade and pat wings dry. Arrange on baking sheets and place in hot oven for 20-25 min. turning half-way through. I then basted wings with 1/2 C. (or as needed)bottled BBQ sauce with 1-2 T. of chili-garlic sauce mixed in. Back into oven for 5 min or until brown and gooey. They were delicious and clean-up was effortless!

These were fantastic!  They have a really good, kind of tangy flavor.  I had to make a few changes.  First, I used tenderloins instead of wings, because that’s what I had on hand.  I also omitted the sesame oil (allergies) and used Tabasco® Garlic Pepper Sauce (that’s probably not the same sauce used in the recipe).  I reduced the sauce before I put it on the chicken. I put the chicken in a foil-lined pan, covered it with the sauce, and baked for 25 minutes.  It turned out very juicy and delightful.  An excellent recipe!

This was way too salty!  I ended up omitting the soy sauce and substituting honey instead.  It turned out great.

These were really very good.  A nice change from buffalo wings.  Mild spice level.  Thanks for the post.

This was easy to make & my family loved it!  I didn't have chili garlic sauce.  Instead, I used a little chili paste, red pepper flakes & garlic powder because that is what I had.  I used only two tbls. of lite soy sauce & a splash of fish sauce & ground ginger.  I made these few changes based on the previous reviews which I ALWAYS read first.  This can be made as hot as you'd like.  I served it with rice on the side.  Delicious!

I tried this and I would suggest using low sodium all natural soy sauce.  I used regular Kikkoman soy sauce and the result was way too salty without many other flavor notes other than soy sauce. Perhaps substituting half of the soy sauce with a fruit juice...

The flavor and taste of these were wonderful. We will defintly make again.   I did mine a little different. I really wanted to try this but only had chicken tenders so used that instead of wing.  I marinated them for about 4-5 hours; then took out of the marinate and coated lightly in flour and fried them up.  Super good and so easy.  We love General Tso; its nice and crispy so wanted to get the same effect.   My husband could not stop saying how much he liked the taste and flavor that were in these.  Served with homemade shrimp fried rice.  Great combo.   Thanks

This tasted great, but it was too salty, and I used half the recommended LOW SODIUM soy sauce. Next time I'm using only a few tablespoons of the soy sauce, more rice vinegar (I didn't have rice wine) and a little less chili garlic sauce. But, even without these changes the it was still tasty.

I tweaked the recipe a little, but it turned out great! Would have been better if I had marinated ahead of time or threw it all in the crock pot.

I made this exactly as listed, although I did add a little bit of honey. We loved it and were sorry I didn't make more.

Very good, very easy. Only cooked two chicken wings, halved the recipe to have a little extra sauce. Made exactly as the recipe said and turned out super moist and delicious! Thansk.

This is good but it is too salty. Need to reduce the soy sauce in half. I did not thicken the sauce too much and put them in my steam rice.

Good tasting, easily made dish.  Other than using Chardonnay instead of rice wine I made recipe as written. Also used left over sauce as dipping sauce for egg rolls.

I liked it, but it was spicy! I’m not sure if I used the same chili garlic sauce or not but luckily I only added half of a tablespoon because it had a kick and a punch! But I liked it! I used low sodium soy sauce and glad I did because even with that it was a tad saltier than I like. I also added in some Chinese long beans and sliced onion, and served it all over top of rice with steamed broccoli. Would definitely make it again, with a few modifications (less spice and less soy)

I took these wings to a "Hen Party" the girls all loved them. I made changes due to what I had. Tripled recipe except for soy sauce (doubled soy sauce plenty strong just right saltiness...would have been too salty tripled). Subbed Brown sugar next time I will use honey instead. I didn't have rice or white wine so subbed seasoned rice vinegar. I didn't have the garlic chili sauce subbed Siracha sauce. Just for gps i added a couple of tablespoons of Ciranos bloody Mary mix.
Loved preparing in a skillet. Super easy! Will make again! Marinade for an hour they had a great flavor!
Thanks!
4 stars only because of.

Hi All, I made these wings a week ago, they were wonderful. My husband, asked me to make them today. It is 12:55am Sunday morning. We slept in today, so it is not problem for me to make them for him. However, big points with hubby. Just for the record, my husband has a well defined palette. I only use a pinch of sugar not even a half teaspoon. Try it. If you like Chinese food, get the standard ingredients, they can be found in any Chinese dish. Enjoy!!

Easy to put together, but nothing very special.
