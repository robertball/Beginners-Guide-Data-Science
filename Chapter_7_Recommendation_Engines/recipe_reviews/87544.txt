Tip: Strain the fresh basil out if you want to save this dressing for later. (I always refrigerate my leftover dressing and this one failed me when I saw the sad black-looking wilted basil floating atop a sea of oil a couple days down the road.)

Love this recipe!  I have made it exactly from the recipe with excellent results, and I have tailored it to my preferences as well.  It turns out best when I add a little bit less oil and honey, and replace about ¼ cup vinegar with ¼ cup white wine.  I use whole a couple of whole basil stocks, stems and leaves and run everything but the garlic through the food processor and let stand overnight.  I then strain out the basil and add minced garlic.  It is a beautiful emerald green color and the flavor is amazing!!!

I'm doing a low-carb diet - so I substituted Splenda for the honey.  It was still tasty.

I LOVED this dressing and thank you so much for posting this .  Previous attempts at a great versatile dressing have failed and so it was refreshing to have this one at last.  I reduced the oil, upped the vinegar and as recommended, reduced the honey.  Tasted wonderful with lots of fresh basil over a pasta salad (pasta, red peppers, olives, onion, tomatoes...simple but yum!)

This dressing was really easy to make and very tasty.  It is also a great way to get rid of any left over fresh basil you might have.  It has a really sweet flavor so if you don't like that than this isn't for you.  This recipe made a lot of dressing so I put the remaining dressing in my own bottle and it has kept great in the fridge - it just needs a little shake up after the oil and vinegar have seperated.

This is similar to a salad dressing we had in one of the Walt Disney restaurants
we were in. It is great on salad but excellent over chicken. A nice change from mayo based dressing. I recommend mixing in a blender. Our newest family favorite.

This was quick, easy and DELICIOUS!  I served it with a mixed green salad with dired cranberries, feta and pecans.  It was a big hit.

I used frozen basil because I did not have any fresh. I did not have fresh garlic so used garlic powder. Too much honey so will cut back a bit next time.  Delicious. Will make again.

Neither of us cared for this much.  Hubs assessed it as having "too much going on, a strong flavor of something (it was the basil) and too sweet."  I concur - and I even cut back on both the basil and the honey.

I love basil so I had to try this dressing and it did not disappoint. Nice balance of sweet (honey), sour (vinegar)and spicy (basil). This will be a staple in my house throughout the summer when fresh basil is readily available. Thanks NEERONDOGS!

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone I make it for.  I blend everything in a blender which makes it thick and creamy. When you blend it it also means it stores better so you can keep in the fridge and use it for days.  it also is great as a chicken marinade.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent starting point for any dressing you want to make.  Sometimes I use rosemary/thyme, sometimes a handful of Ital. parsley.  Try adding 2 tbs. dijon mustard for a VERY nice honey-dijon dressing!

I decided to throw all the ingredients into a food processor and it was delicious! I used only a 1/4 cup of both vinegar and olive oil, I will make this again on a regular basis.

I really like this salad dressing!  I used extra virgin olive oil (I think I will use classic next time, as the extra virgin is a little bitter).  I added salt and cracked pepper after I had it on my salad for the first time.  I feel like the salt and pepper really made a difference in the overall flavor. To suit my taste buds, I will add more minced garlic. Very good & simple recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This was awesome! I put it on a salad with Bibb lettuce, zucchini and yellow squash with some sliced mushroom - everyone loved this! The best compliment was "This tastes just like summer!"- I will make this again! :)

We all loved this dressing.  I only made a half a batch, and am I ever sorry.  If you have some basil growing outside, you have it made!  I used only half the honey, but I think that 3/4 of the honey would be perfect.  And we needed to sprinkle a little salt over our lettuce.  This would be good as a drizzle over any roasted poultry.  This is VERY good!

Made this last night for company and it was a big hit! Delicious! Served vinaigrette in small bowl with a spoon so everyone could serve themselves & pour over spring mixed greens with sliced cucumber and yellow pepper. Guests were also spooning it on their plates for dipping garlic bread. Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe and have made it several times but have always saved it for times when I could use up the whole amount if we had a large group of people over.  Just recently I happened to see "the most helpful critical review".  I don't know why I never thought of this before, just strain out the basil so you don't have to deal with it turning "black". Now I use almost double the amount of basil, strain it after I use it the first time and we continue to enjoy it throughout the week. Thank you GOCUBSGO for the good idea.  We are basil lovers and I always over-grow this wonderful herb in the summer.

Excellent.  I served it over sliced tomatoes onions and cucumbers. I like to blend it all together, makes a nice emulsion of light green dressing with flecks of basil.

Delicious! I eyeballed all of the ingredients listed and only added a bit of lemon zest and pulsed in the magic bullet.  I will never buy another basil vinaigrette.

Excellent, easy, light-tasting dressing. I found that it needed a little salt and pepper - and that it's twice as good the next day (which is true of most vinaigrettes, anyway). Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I love this. For me it's the perfect amount of oil vs vinegar. I added a bit more fresh garlic & less honey. Threw it in the blender. Really, really good, thanks!

Love it!  I would cut back on the oil as some of the others said and I added some salt. I used fresh Basil and put everything in a blender and blended everything together. Turned out fantastic!  Everyone loved it!

I tried the recipe.  It had too much oil for my taste.  The 2nd time I made it, I reduced the olive oil to 2/3 cups and increased the vinegar to 1/2 cup. I also toned down the garlic slightly.  For me, that was a much better ratio.  It was great with tomato and mozzarella.

Fabulous!  I just made this dressing for a cold pasta salad.  It was perfect for my summer picnic.  It is a touch sweet and I reduced the amount of honey.  I also put this dressing in the food processor to break down the garlic and basil.  Let it sit a bit before using it to allow the flavors to blend.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This was OK. I've had better vinaigrettes. Was a little bland.

A-freaking-mazing. It tastes exactly like the dressing my favorite caterers make. All the family loved it, especially my dad and he dislikes any dressing with honey in it... he never even knew

This is so good. I had to used dried basil as I had no fresh on hand, and after tasting it, it was a bit too sweet for my liking. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of dijon mustard, and that appeared to have done the trick!

Nice light dressing that's pleasantly sweet but not overly so.  Ok to cut back on the oil a little bit without affecting flavour.

Had this with Spinach Salad with Pistachio Chicken (also from allrecipes.com). The honey did make it a lot sweeter than other vinaigrettes I have tried, but it was delicious! It added a beautiful basil flavor and really complimented the tases of the chicken dinner salad!

This dressing is great but needs salt.  I use it on pasta salad and add extra basil and red onion.  Great pasta salad dresssing.  Sometimes I cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and its still great!

Simple yet amazing dressing. I made at for a labor day family gathering and everyone loved it. Used it on a green salad. I used more basil than the recipe called for AND I threw everything in a blender which gave it a very strong and rich flavor! will be making this again for sure

i had a basil plant and needed ideas to use it. did a quick search an this easy and simple recipe came up. it is DELICIOUS! i have made it about 3 times in the past few weeks and even used it as a dressing for a pasta salad which was very well received. very fresh, light, and basil-y. i did adjust the vinegar and the honey and oil to my own personal preference though. play around with it until you like the taste, it is delicious!

Because I live in The Philippines I use either fresh cane vinegar or coconut vinegar. Both are just great and I use more vinegar proportionately than the recipe calls for. Occasionally I have to substitute washed sugar for the honey since honey is expensive and one never knows what it will taste like when we buy it.

Yes I agree that if saving it in the fridge we need to strain out the basil & use new basil the next time the dressing is used.

Excellent. I added crushed red pepper for a little kick and used maple syrup instead of honey because that was on hand. We topped grilled squash with this and it was also delicious on pasta salad. Really nice dressing.

So good! I used basil fresh from my garden and added a tiny bit more vinegar and added some fresh pepper and sea salt. I used it on an arugula salad with cranberries, toasted almond slivers and goat cheese crumbles. It tasted exactly like a salad I got at a great bistro.

This was quite good. I put everything in a container and used an emulsion blender to mix. The basil was fine the next day-did not turn black. It was a very green mixture. I will make this again.

my basil is taking over the garden so was glad to get a quick and easy recipe ... dressed a chopped salad of greens and assorted veggies found hiding in the fridge ... chopped a handfull of candied pecans and a couple spoons of blue cheese crumbles ... EXCELLENT!

I loved this dressing!  It EXACTLY fit into one of those old glass dressing shakers that were popular in the 70's and 80's.  It was also really tasty.  I didn't use the blender so it was pretty much solid when I'd get it out of the fridge but I'd just remember to do it while I was making my meal and it was ready to go when it was time to eat.  Just needed a little shake before pouring.  Or you could hold it under warm running water too.  I'll definitely make this again.

Too much oil in my opinion, but still good.  It was much better when i cut the oil down to 1/2 cup.  I kept all the other ingredients the same.  All in all a good recipe and could be tweaked even more.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for sharing this!  We have 2 very large basil plants this year.  I am always looking to use it in a new manner. 

I put this on a salad with grilled salmon, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, feta, tomatoes from my garden, fresh local cucumbers, a little fresh cilantro from my garden, and the final ingredient: LOVE.


That's right, if we all put love into every decision we make, the world will be a better place.  Put LOVE into your life!

Jimbo

So easy, so simple yet so delicious.  Makes me say bye-bye to store bought dressing.  I did add a pinch of kosher salt.  The fresh taste is delicious.  Thank you NEERONDOGS for reminding us how easy it is to eat healthier.

This is an amazingly simple recipe.  I planted a basil plant out side just for this dressing.  I personally don't like it because of the apple cider vinegar. So far, I am the only on that hasn't liked it.  Everywhere I go people want me to bring a batch. I make a huge batch for wife to take to work and all her coworkers tear it up.  Typically I just toss everything in the blender and bam everyone's favorite dressing.  Thanks for sharing.

Though this follows the same vinegar:oil ratio as many vinaigrettes, it felt overly-oily and bland.

Yum. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. I also used pre-minced garlic, added a touch more honey, and a splash of linme juice. Very good, versatile, and customizable!

Loved this. I halved it since it was just me and my husband. It was nice and light and I love that it was not to "vinigary". The honey adds a nice flavor.

I seriously had to make this for a month solid for my mom it was so tasty! When the basil is fresh at the market, this is a great treat. I sometimes substitute flax oil for olive oil which is a healthier option. Also, a dash of lemon juice does seem to brighten it up even more.

Pretty good. I halved it and I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried.  I bet it is 100% better with fresh - I will try again using that. This good on a spinach salad.

Not my taste - or my husbands.  It was just missing something, I think.

Good start.  I doubled the vinegar and added garlic powder and salt.

Great taste! I followed others and added a little less oil but the honey and basil really balances everything out. Great refreshing change from those fat laden creamy dressings.

Very good vinaigrette but I do think there is a tad too much oil. I also agree with other reviews - I added a bit more vinegar to mine.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  I put it on a spinach salad with apples, feta cheese, sugared pecans, and cooked squash and onions.

Just what I needed. We live in the Philippines and store-bought salad dressing is too expensive. So I was looking for a simple, yet healthy, recipe that I could make myself. This was exactly what I wanted. I tried what others said about putting less honey. But it was not the right balance. Ended up putting exactly what the recipe calls for and it turned out wonderful.
Thank you for sharing it.

As is, I felt it was missing something. I added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a good pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper. I mixed everything in my Magic Bullet blender. Leftovers kept well in the fridge. I will definitely be making this again using my alterations.

I used half a cup regular olive oil and a quarter cup each of basil and garlic oil. I also added in black pepper to taste.

Great, quick dressing! I did modify by adding 2T of coconut aminos to the base recipe and only 3/4 C of oil and 1 t honey. Served over thick sliced ripe tomatoes. Yum!

Followed the recipe, added just a touch not garlic and ran entire mix in small smoothie blender.  Tastes great and lasts for days in the fridge.  Try with a pinch of pink salt - delish!

This is a great sweet dressing. It is really good over spinach. Add crumbled bacon to balance the sweet. Because of fresh herb, it's probably best to make fresh each time. Very simple to make!

I didn't have the apple cider so I used rice vinegar instead. It was great.  I also grow basil in the summer and enjoyed this recipe. I wasn't sure if my children would like it but they loved it.
