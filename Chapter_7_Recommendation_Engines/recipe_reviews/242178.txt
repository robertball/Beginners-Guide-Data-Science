What a bright and refreshing salad.  Used green grapes instead of red (think that gives the salad a little more eye appeal), and I did add just a little squeeze of both the lemon and lime which only heightened the citrus flavor.  Very good combination of ingredients, each one complementing the other.   Thanks for sharing your recipe.

So good! So fast and easy to make! I like that adding the zest enhances the fruit without overpowering it. I used black grapes and left them whole. I also served it in small glasses, which makes it seem "fancier" lol. This is a great addition to any BBQ or summer party!

So easy, and I can't stop eating. Added a touch of honey.
