Great recipe!  I added one chopped green pepper to it.  When your making it for the first time, you are looking at the sauce and the noodles and thinking "this canâ€™t be enough noodles", but it really does work out perfect.  I will defiantly be this making more often for my family.

I have now made this about a dozen times.  I tweak it by making it with 1 lb ground beef & 1 lb sweet italian sausage, gives it a much more Italian flavor.  NEVER use canned mushrooms in any recipe, opt for the fresh.  Also, cut back on the onions, 1/2 of a white chopped finely will do the job (and I love onions).

My family absolutely loved this recipe the first time I made it.  The second time around I decided to alter it a bit; they loved it even more.  I added 6 oz of mushroom instead of 4.5 and to make cheesier I added 1lb of process cheese instead of a 1/2; needless to say this is a family favorite.

This was very good. I had about 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef to use. I didn't have spirals so I used half a box of penne. (For me pasta is pasta for the most part.) I wound up using a whole container (16 oz) of the sour cream and I subbed the American cheese with shredded cheddar. I didn't use the whole 2 cups of mozzarella. This all fit very nicely in a 9x13 dish.

This was good, easy and delicious! The only difference was that I used cubed cheddar cheese instead of the processed American cheese. It was a fine addition to this recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy to make. I only made minor adjustments. 1) I didn't have any American cheese, so I just added more mozzarella. 2) During the last 5 minutes (uncovered) I added some Parmesan cheese to the top. 3) While cooking the sauce/beef mixture, I added some oregano and Italian seasoning for more flavor. And 4) I didn't have any spiral noodles, so I just used regular spaghetti noodles.  My husband loved it! "It's like spaghetti, only BETTER!"

Loved this!  I did melt some velveeta in the sauce/burger combination and I stirred the sour cream into the sauce.  It made it so rich and yummy!  LOVE this!

My family loved this
my husband said "man, that was good ahh i mean really good"
I didn't like it as much as they did but that's just because there's a lot of oniions and i'm not a huge onion fan.  I made it as directed.

This was good.  I think all the cheese made it seem kind of goopey.  It was tasty though.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  My kids and hubby enjoyed more than I did so I'm sure I'll make it again and probably decrease the amount of cheese a little bit.

This is a great recipe, my kids all ask for seconds. I am a huge sour cream fan, and I like the fact that sour cream is cheaper than ricotta cheese. will keep this on the menu rotation!

I made this last night. Only one small onion. Used one cup sour cream, omitted the American cheese, cut the shredded cheese by half, used shredded cheddar as that was all I had.  Everyone loved it!

This was pretty good. Since I'm only cooking for my hubby and I, I halved the recipe. It only called for 1 cup of pasta, that wasn't nearly enough so I added 2 cups. I also used a 6 oz can of mushrooms and added dried basil and Italian seasoning. Since the market I go to does not sell American cheese in anything but slices, I used mild cheddar instead. It was very tasty! I'll be making this again :o)

This was so easy to prepare and my family loved it! I made a few changes though: omitted the onion and mushrooms, used onion salt instead, omitted American cheese used parmeasn instead. The idea is to basically use what you have in your pantry. It's okay to make changes! Hope this helps.

Very good! I told my husband I couldn't make a casserole with meat sauce because I didn't have any ricotta but then I found this recipe.  With the American cheese and the sour cream the finished product looked like ricotta.  It was pretty cool.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 14 oz can of tomatoes and 1 8 oz can of tomatoe sauce.  I also didn't have spirals and used egg noodles.  Guess this is a pretty versitale recipe!

Very cheesey and very good!!  I halved this recipe and used fresh mushrooms.  Just sauteed them off with butter and threw them in with the beef.  Added extra cheese on top.  Very simple and tasty!

This turned out really good! I made this at 11 AM so it would be quick to put in the oven for dinner time. Used a little more than 3 cups of penne pasta, and didnt worry about layering it. Just drained the noodles, and combined it with the meat sauce and sour cream, and dumped it in a 9x13 baking dish and it fit perfectly. I didnt have any mozerella cheese so I just used shredded cheddar. Served it with garlic bread, and myself, my DH, 5 year old, 2 year old, and 1 year old boys loved it! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Kids loved it!  The only thing I did different, which is minor, is used fresh chopped mushrooms instead of canned and I threw in an extra clove of garlic (my first one seemed rather small).  Husband even loved it....I had planned it for leftovers the next night, but he ate it when he came home at 3am from work, and again at lunch the next day.  :)  Must've been good heated up as well!  Definitely a keeper for my family. :)

2 lb of beef sounded like a lot, so I only used 1 lb, and increased the pasta (I used whole wheat penne) to 3 heaping cups.  The sauce covered perfectly.  I also only used about 1 1/2 C of the mozzarella cheese.  I served it with steamed broccoli and ended up mixing the leftovers together.  Next time I may just add the broccoli to the casserole.  The kids loved it, and my husband and I liked it well enough to keep it in rotation.

I wanted to make this a second time, but allrecipes.com was down. So, I happened to forget the sour cream, added a total of 12 ozs. of Velveeta.  Plus, we had decided to try a full box of spiral noodles.  We don't care for mushrooms, so I omitted them.  And, put sauteed green peppers in its place.  The entire family (including my very picky eater) liked the original recipe, but LOVE the recipe that I changed it to.  It's a fairly flexible recipe to suit your individual needs.

Our family absolutely loves this recipe!!  I have used the spiral noodles as well as macaroni noodles. My pickiest eater loves it as well!  This is one of those comfort type dishes that is truly filling and yummy!

This was really good. My family loved it!  I did hide the mushroms though by chopping them up into tiny pieces.  I made it ahead of time and it still came out yummy.

I halved this recipe because I was just cooking for my husband and myself.  This recipe is a keeper, I served with a salad and baked potatoes, yum yum.

Simple and delicious.  Add a garlic loaf or a green salad and you have a complete meal.

My "he hates everything" child cleaned his plate! Everyone loved this. I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream and creamy swiss instead of the other two cheeses. Also baby shells instead of the spirals, but that never really matters.

i made tonight and it was good, the only issue i had with it was the canned sauce ( which i did not do) , i made fresh sauce form another recipe on here and it was amazing, and i left out the mushrooms YUCK ... overall i would recommend, just use another sauce.

I recently saw this recipe using 1 can condensed cheddar cheese soup instead of the sour cream. Just wondered if anyone has tried that? I'm scared my family would freak over anything resembling ricotta cheese.

I made this with macaroni because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I didn't have any American cheese, so I just added extra mozzerella.  The whole family enjoyed it!

I agree with the reviewer who said it doesn't look like enough noodles.  It does work out in the end, however, it is on the meatier side, so next time I think I'm going to put 1/4 cup more noodles in.  I used high fibre pasta and it was quite filling.  I omitted the American cheese (in Canada, that is the equivalent to cheese slices, and I didn't think it was worth the extra calories) - didn't miss it at all.  The sour cream does give it a tang.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I did make a few modifications based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I had cheddar cheese, so I used that instead of American, and used a little less than 1/2 lb.  Also, I went a little heavy on the sour cream because I had some I wanted to use up.  Even with those changes, I loved the casserole, and I'll make it again for sure!

OOPS! I accidentally added a jar of SALSA instead of a jar of spaghetti sauce (these jars all look the same!) Anyway, turned out really great! Good mistake!
