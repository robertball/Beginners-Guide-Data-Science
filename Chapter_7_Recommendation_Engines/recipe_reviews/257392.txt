3.16.17  Cut back a little on the sugar, since I seem to like food less sweet these days (personal taste preference), and I used Trader Joeâ€™s lemon sparkling water (what I had on hand).  The first flavor that you taste is the fresh cucumber, than the tea kicks in, and the sparkling water just makes it all refereshing.  Hubby not a big fan of this (not surprised), but I definitely liked it and will be making it again.  r4ch31-9xx, thanks for a new drink.
