It's pretty good, but as a Japanese I just could not pour hoisin sauce over the tofu. I guess it's quick and easy that way, but it's so much better with soy sauce, mirin (rice wine), and kelp broth. You also have to have grated ginger on top of the tofu. Yummy!!

YUMMY!! This is exactly like the tofu I get at my favorite asian restaurants! 

I used it as a replacement for chicken in a stir fry recipe with the following orange ginger glaze:
 
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
3/4 cup orange juice 
3 tablespoons light soy sauce 
1 tablespoon honey 
1 teaspoon minced ginger

This is just SO good. I cube the tofu then put them between layers of paper towels for a few minutes. This gets the excess water out so there's no splattering when the tofu hits the oil.

Very authentic in taste and texture (lived in Japan for 8 yrs).  Instead of hoisin sauce, I combined chicken broth and soy sauce (about a 2:1 ratio) and fresh lemon juice - (adjust to taste).

This is fantastic as an appetizer or a main dish for a quick one person meal.  Even people who profess to HATE tofu love it and usually don't even know what it is.  I skipped the hoisen and mixed up a light sauce of soy, ginger, sesame oil, and red wine vinegar to drizzle over the top.  Excellent recipe!!

Very tasty. I darned near killed myself with all of the splattering oil, though. I am going to have to invest in a splatter screen if I make this again!

I've been looking for a good tofu recipe for 3 years and have tried many.  This is the best!  I even had Hoisin sauce in my cupboard but had never found a use for it.  MSG affects me negatively, so I was happy to find a recipe I could use at home.  I added steamed broccoli.

I had never had/cooked tofu, so I thought this was an easy recipe to try.  I added salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic to the cornstarch! I also cubed the tofu into smaller bite size bites and squezzed lemon juice on top when they were done cooking along with some kosher salt and the green onions.  My kids (3 & 5) loved it, they thought it was cheese though and i didn't correct them!  It was good, I think i would add some seasoning directly to the tofu next time before i dredge it in the cornstarch, just for a little more flavor! I am not afraid of tofu any more.

Good, simple recipe.  I dredged the tofu in flour instead of the cornstarch (since it was what I had), and heated the hoisin sauce in a skillet and tossed with the fried tofu.  Really good by itself of served over rice.

This is the first time I have ever cooked tofu. I should have paid more attention to the reviews and dried the tofu a bit before putting into the corn starch. My corn starch was mushy. If I make this again I would add seasoning to the corn starch as well. It tasted pretty good to me but I was the only one in my house to eat it. Perhaps my children just didn't like the hoisin sauce?!?

Delicious tofu recipe! After frying, I sprinkled the cubes with toasted sesame seeds and green onion and served it with a sauce recommended by another reviewer.... soy sauce, combined with a little sesame oil, red wine vinegar, and grated, fresh ginger. Served a stir-fry of broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage and onion as a side dish. Everyone loved it!

this recipe as is is a good place to start. i season the cornstarch, for instance. i'd like to tell others though -- try and use at least 1" cubes. too small, and you might lose the flavor of the tofu -- unless that's what you're going for! ths recipe is versitle and great fun. thanks!

YUM! I used Mochiko (sweet rice flour) in place of corn starch, tastes exactly like the Agedashi appetizer that a trendy, super-expensive sushi restaurant in La Jolla USED to serve. My 2-year-old and I just macked away until the all of the tofu was gone!  This is super easy, healthful, and so incredibly yummy, I will make this often.

I had some dressing left over that consited of soy sauce,sesame oil,lime,cilantro,garlic and ginger. This was delicious on top of the tofu. The coating is crispy. The possibilities of the tofu cooked like this are endless. I will have to try it with sweet and sour.I will also cut it in strips and add ranch powder to cornstarch and make mock chicken fingers for my kids. Thank You

Used this method of preparing tofu with a General's Tso's sauce I found on this site. It was the perfect consistancy. Thanks!

I sliced mine into "sticks", then fried them, and they looked just like fish sticks!  The kids held them and dipped them into the sauce.  Before I sliced the tofu, I pressed it to drain out extra liquid.  I think this is very important to keep the cornstarch from getting sloppy.  Firm or extra firm tofu works best for pressing!  Ours fried up nice and crisp on the outside, warm and creamy on the inside.

Just sat down from making this. I liked it a lot. I still have to tweak it to my taste buds. But that is what cooking is, science on the stove. Oh, I fried mine in safflower oil (found in the olive oil section), it was a light almost flavorless tasting oil. I gave some to friends who haven't tried anything tofu before. They seemed to like it, being hard core carnivores. I wasn't expecting miracles. So a little bit interest in trying it was good.

I'm sorry...I had high hopes for this recipe.  There's a reason it's called "esque"...it tastes nothing like the agedashi tofu I've had before.  My main complaint is the hoisen sauce..the staple of this dish.  It's name comes from the dashi soup mix and this ingredient is not even in this recipe!  The only reason I gave it any stars is because my friends loved it, though I have a feeling they were just being nice.

I made this using medium firm tofu instead as that better approximates Agedashi Tofu.  It was harder to work with but so much better!

I wanted to like this recipe as I love Agedashi Tofu BUT too many flaws for such a simple dish. The extra firm tofu didn't result in the lovely creamy center that agedashi tofu is supposed to have and hoisin sauce is too heavy + sweet to use on delicate tofu. Replace extra firm tofu with soft tofu and replace the hoisin with a simmered mixture of 3/4 cup dashi broth, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin and 2 tsp sugar and you'll have a much nicer dish.

I fried each side until it got crispy and a very light tan color.  The Hoisin sauce was not very good but soy sauce was perfect.  Very tasty.

I always order this dish at japanese restaurants. Now I can make it myself but I use soy sauce w/ sesame oil and rice vinegar instead of hoisin sauce.

Recipe was very simple yet really effective and very tasty. An interesting texture that accompanied the 'wet' dishes well. Will definitely be making this again.

I had never thought of frying tofu when I read this recipe. I already had my tofu, but didn't want to make a special trip to the store for hoisin sauce. SO I cut my tofu into 24 cubes (because 12 were too big.) Then I pressed the tofu in paper towels to get out as much water as possible. Then, with 12 cubes, I put cumin, oregano, garlic and salt (all to taste) in cornstarch and fried them. Drained them and had in salad. Yum!Yum! The other 12, I put cinnamon in cornstarch and then fried (seperate pan) them. Drained them and then ate with yogurt. Not too sweet, but that's the way I like things! Rolling them in sugar right out of the pan, and then draining them, would definitely sweeten them up. I liked this new (to me) idea of tofu. Next time, maybe crumbling the tofu before rolling in cornstarch for toppings?

This was good and reminds me of a dish we eat at a local Thai restuarant called "Sweet Basil Tofu".  The tofu is fried like this, the sauce is some type of coconut creamy white sauce with lots of vegies added.  Does anyone have an idea for this sauce?

Pretty good!  I never had tofu before and this was a good first try :)  I did squeeze out a lot of the liquid first though and I think it made a big difference.  Instead of drizzling the hoisin which is thick and not easy to drizzle, I put the tofu in a large bowl and stirred it around with the hoisin.  I served it with rice with veggies mixed in with a drizzle of sesame oil on top.

Awesome simple recipe that you can do so many things with.  Play around with the spices, sauces, and sizes and you will come out with a lot of variety.  You can put them on salds, place them in salads, and the basic recipe provided is awesome by itself.  Very traditional.

As followed, the recipe is bland. I added black pepper, salt, and lawry's seasoned salt to the corn starch. For the dipping sauce, I didn't like the hoisin sauce with tofu. I much prefer the broth, lemon juice, and soy sauce with chopped green onion as suggested by a previous reviewer. Very good and similar to agadashi tofu served at my favorite Japanese restaurant. Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice & look forward to making it again & again. I stayed true to the recipe the first time however, on the second time I used flour insted of cornstarch. The cornstarch makes the tofu a little chewy (in a good way) whereas the flour leaves it a bit lighter. Both ways worked good for me. If you don't have hoisin, sweet & sour sauce is awesome with this as well!

I cut my tofu into "sticks". My results were very crispy on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside.  Be sure to let the oil get hot enough so that it pops when you drip water on it - maybe that's why other reviewers had slimy results? I think I will add some flavor to the cornstarch next time.

This is an amazing dish for vegetarians who cannot think of what to do with their tofu! It came out delicious and fast every time I made it. I did not like the hoi-sin sauce so I dipped the peices in soy sauce.

A very nice simple and easy to prepare dish.  It's a favorite at my house, however, more cornstarch may be needed to sufficiently coat the tofu than the recipe calls for.

This was good but the cornstarch did turn a little slimy.  It still tasted really good though.  I did pour a little bit of soy sauce over the tofu though to give it a little more flavor.  This will be something I make again.

I won't make this again, it was lacking in flavor and the grease made my tummy feel sick.  What I would consider Junky health food the grease takes away the benefits of the tofu.

Found tofu in the fridge, was hungry, so came here looking for a recipe. This one looked quick and easy enough. I didn't have the cornstarch, so I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs and sauted it in olive oil w/green onions. My husband was curious to know what smelled so good. I put some steamed rice in a bowl with a little soy sauce, then topped it with the tofu. It really tasted great for a quick meal. I can't wait to try it as it is written, but for now the Italian bread crumbs got me through in a pinch!

This is my favourite way to cook up tofu! Crispy outside, soft inside. Drizzle some hoisin sauce on top and serve with a small bowl of soy sauce and you're set. Great with a green salad and sliced cucumbers.

The tofu was tasty but Hoisin is not the way to go if you want it to be like it is when served in a Japanese restaurant! I'll follow other reviews and try a different suggested sauce next time.

I loved this recipie, i made it yesterday and ate it with green onions and hosin sause on rice and it was amazing. and the best part was the whole dinner only took me 10 minuets. i acually liked it so much that today i took the tofu out of my leftover coconut curry soup and fried it like this and then put it back in the soup and added noodles. it was fantastic and held its "crunch" even in soup:) all around a very versatile recipie and makes tofu not taste like tofu.

This was the first time I ever prepared tofu, so this was a big deal. The only thing I did different from the recipe was add a little sea salt, garlic powder and chili powder to the cornstarch mixture and I cut the tofu into smaller cubes. It was delightful! I'll definitely do this again, especially for a fast weeknight dish.
