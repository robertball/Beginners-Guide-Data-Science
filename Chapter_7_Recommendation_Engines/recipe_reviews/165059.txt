When I told my family I was making Salmon with Peach sauce, the grandkids made faces, but they've tasted it now and the youngest is asking me to make it for his birthday dinner!  They all love it.  If it rains, you can bake the salmon in foil packets with made-ahead sauce at 375 for 15-20 min.  It comes out jucy and delicious, maybe better than on the grill.

Quick & Easy! My husband and I enjoy curry as well as Salmon. However, I have never mixed those flavors together. I intended on making this recipe with canned peaches as other reviewers suggested. When I went to the cupboard I realized that all I had on hand was canned apricots. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I started the curry sauce right when I put the salmon in the oven and it was just right when the timer dinged! I am guessing that if you use fresh fruit, more time would be needed to break down the fruit into a nice curried sauce. We will use this again for a simple way to dress up salmon.

Terrific and simple. I used less honey than the recipe called for -- the peaches, in season, that I used were very sweet on their own. And I also sprinkled some fresh mint on top, which complimented the peaches well.

If you like the taste of flavor combinations you wouldn't think are appetizing, then this is for you! I couldn't find fresh peaches so I bought Del Monte's canned peaches in light syrup.  I drained most of the syrup from the can. 
Next time I  made it I bought canned apricots and it was even better!

My Boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  It was so good.  I made it again with Chicken instead of Salmon and it was still just as good!  Served with Rice is best.

So simple and very flavorful.  I used more curry than called for and used "Chunky Peach Spread" from this website.  Very good with a side of rice and some asparagus.

I wasn't sure if Husband would like this but he absolutely wolfed it down! I made it with Madras curry powder which is pretty potent, and I cut back on the amount of honey as the peach was ripe, sweet and juicy. The flavors worked amazingly nicely. Thanks, Slinkee!

This meal was excellent! The sprig of mint is key, and only did about 1/3 cup of honey and added some red pepper flakes. My boyfrend raved about how it was like eating a dish at a five star restaurant. I served it with a baked sweet potato and steamed asparagus, amazing combo! Thank you so much for sharing!

This is awesome...exceeded my expectations. I used canned peaches as fresh are not around this time of year.  Weather permitting, I'm always out grilling (charcoal). I've cooked a slew of salmon recipes, both on the grill and on my smoker. This one is in my top five and an instant fave!

This was so delicious that I took the left over salmon for lunch the next day, put it over a bed of lettuce and used the peach sauce as an alternative dressing.  MMMM MMMM  very good! sweet with just a tiny kick.

So delicious! I was looking for a different way to make salmon and this recipe was a nice change. I halved the amount of honey and next time I will use even less because it was a little too sweet for my taste, other than that this is an excellent recipe!

Great recipe that my daughter shared with me.  She uses canned peaches, she had it on hand.  It would work well with Mango or pineapple too I think.  I added some Garam Marsala per her suggestion.  It was great on salmon.

Particularly in August when peaches are in season in Ontario, you feel like you're closer to nature.  This is a fantastic and simple recipe that was really popular.  Definitely a keeper.  I used a salmon filet and broiled in the oven with the same effect.

Tried this for my husband who has a new found love of curry. I'm not really a fan but tried it anyways. We both loved it. I cooked it in the oven in a foil packet as advised in other reviews. Super easy and tasted delish. Now I have a quick run to recipe to use when my peaches are about to go bad. I would only try with fresh peaches as otherwise advised also. Served this with green beans and mashed potatoes. Definately will make again!

I didn't have fresh peaces, so I used frozen, added a little peach snapps and cooked the sauce down a bit. Served with rice and have done it with all kinds of fish, chicken, chops. A keeper!

I liked this curried peach sauce. However I took the advice of another person & used much less honey. I tested this out on my family & they did not like it, just because they are not curry lovers.

Loved how quick and easy this was. Very fresh. The peaches were awesome. I love curry so I will add additional curry powder next time.

I found this recipe last week & with my peach tree Loading me down with peaches I thought I'd try it. I had been planning on chicken, so that's what I used. Really Very good, it would be great on pork also. Tonight I'm having Salmon & no doubt that will be excellent too. Oh, I don't have curry so I used Turmeric. Cooking is an art folks, don't be afraid to try different things. If you're new to cooking follow recipes until you gain experience...then blossom! Nice recipe, thanks!

Didn't really care for this so I added a can of coconut milk and boiled it down and it was great with cod over a wild rice blend.

What a great combination of flavours!  My Hubby and I are trying to eat healthier by incorporating more fish into our diet.  This recipe looked easy and fast, and with a bumper crop of peaches this year - trying it was a no-brainer.  Am I ever glad we did! This is one of our favourites.  We've made it numerous times. I've made the sauce with hot roasted curry powder as well as a traditional mild version, and I've cooked the sauce down until it was well done, as well as leaving the peaches a little 'al dente.  I must admit I don't have a favourite way of doing it - sort of as the spirit moves me for the day.  I do find that I use less honey in the summer when peaches are in season, and I tend to up the honey amount in the winter months.  I've never tried it with canned peaches, but that's on my list to do.  It's fast and easy enough to make after work, but it also makes a great meal and one heck of a conversation piece served to guests.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it.  We even served it to friends down in Nova Scotia, who were extremely sceptical to start but ended up loving it.  This is a simple dish, fast and easy, and most important - terrific.  I would recommend this recipe.  Put your pre-conceived ideas aside and give it a try.  A real winner!

I loved this dish! I baked my salmon instead of grilled it and it was so good! The meal was very filling. I love fresh fruit and I have a serious sweet tooth so this was just perfect. :)

Didn't like this combination. The curried peach sauce seemed to overpower the taste of the fish. I think this sauce would be great with a mild white fish like halibut.

A very simple and tasty sauce!! I added a dash of vinegar. Like all of the suggestions in the comments.

This wasn't bad. I just like other recipes better.
