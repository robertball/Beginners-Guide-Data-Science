I peeled about 3.5 lbs. of russet potatoes, and didn't use quite as much garlic powder as the recipe calls for.  I also left out the milk and used 8oz sour cream and about 1 cup of shredded colby cheese (1/2 c butter).  These mashed potatoes were the perfect consistency and SOOO creamy and flavorful. My entire family of picky eaters loved them!  Reminded us of the "smashed potatoes" at one of our favorite restaurants!  Thanks for sharing a great idea!

Made as stated, this is worth three stars. It's a nice dish to come home to, but not spectacular. However, I dressed this recipe up tonight for my company's pot-luck Christmas party. I drained off most of the water and added 1/3 of an 8 oz block of cream cheese, diced, and about 1/2 cup of sour cream, with about 1/2 a cup of milk, or less (I confess to not measuring).  I mashed these with my electric mixer, then stirred in 1/2 cup of shredded colby/jack cheese. I covered the dish with another half a cup of cheese. At the party, my pot was scraped clean, and I even caught someone licking the spoon!

5 stars with some tweeking... I peeled the potatoes, used chicken broth for the liquid & a whole bulb of roasted garlic instead of the granulated garlic. I took some fresh sprigs of rosemary & draped them over the top while the were cooking. The rosemary infused the potatoes with the most amazing scent & flavor! When the potatoes were done cooking, I removed the rosemary sprigs & mashed them with butter & whole milk. They were hands down, the BEST mashed potatoes ever....Everyone agreed.

These worked great for me.  I used minced fresh garlic, rather than powder.  Adjusted butter, cream and seasoning at the end to taste.  This worked great for an after church lunch with no fuss.  I prepared the potatoes the night before and covered them with water.

Super easy and absolutely wonderful!  I increase the recipe to use 5 lbs of red potatoes.  It is the perfect amount for Thanksgiving with my family.

Mmmmm, this was very yummy!  I added some fresh cloves of garlic.  I sliced them and put them in with the potatoes while they were baking.  Then I mashed them all together and it was very garlicky, just how we like it.  Thanks for the crockpot recipe!

Excellent.  Much denser than traditional mashed potatoes.  I added several crushed whole cloves of fresh garlic which then got mashed into the potatoes.

I tried this recipe over the weekend and I really thought it was easy.  I added a little bit more milk than what the recipe called for and I added some butter.  They were great and I recommend trying this recipe!

These were just ok for us. Every Thanksgiving I make 2 types of mashed potatoes for variety. I was happy to find this recipe being they are made in the crock pot, to save me time. I changed the recipe to 15 servings because I used 5 pounds of potatoes, and they were edible, not terribly bad, but not a favorite. To many of us, they tasted like roasted potatoes that were later mashed. They do save time and are passible, but I'm sure glad I had another pan to serve. Thanks for the recipe, but I prefer mashed potatoes made using the original method.

This was a tasty dish, but it needs a few changes to it.  I put a can of chicken broth over the potatoes after this had been in the crock pot for about an hour because I was worried that it was going to burn.  For this reason, I would suggest that you completely cover the potatoes and increase the water for this recipe so that the potatoes don't burn.  For my son that's lactose intolerant, I saved potatoes for him before putting in cream cheese and a little bit of milk.  I may have accidentally put in too much garlic powder and next time I think that I'll use fresh garlic instead.

I LOVE this recipe!  I've made with brown or red potatoes.  If you like restaurant potatoes (that taste more like smashed baked potatoes) then use brown...I personally don't like that flavor, so I use red....makes Thanksgiving/Easter/Christmas dinners SOOO much easier!  Use a mixer right in your crockpot 30 min before guests arrive and switch to warm.....you can even cook these the night before, then reheat the morning of your dinner, if you are eating early.

I tried this recipe today and it was GREAT!  I added a little more garlic to my taste, and a little more water.  Also, I had no butter in the fridge, so instead of the butter, I used sour cream. This recipe turned out great.

Oh my!  So easy and so delicious!  I doubled the recipe but used only 1 t. Kosher salt (plenty salty) and left out the pepper.  I did use real butter and just lightly sprinkled the garlic powder over the potatoes--didn't measure but wasn't heavy-handed.  After 3 1/2 hours on HIGH, the potatoes were done (only cut them in half but did peel them as they weren't the best Russets I had).  I mashed them in the crock and used 1 3/4 cups of 2% milk.  Creamy, delicious, yummy!  I left them on warm until dinner.  Next time, I think I would triple the recipe, just to have leftovers or to have enough for guests.

Came out awsome, I love the fact that this site allows you to change the serving size. Anyhow, I changed to 4 servings for 2 of us at home (extra for left overs) and my fiancee says they taste just like his moms. I left them a little lumpy since thats how he likes them. I did add about 2 cups of water since I had them going for over 6 hrs and just drained the seasoning/flavor water and added milk, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Anyhow, you will love these I had them on the table in 4-5 mins tops.

These are great for pot lucks and holiday dinners.  I've followed the recipe to a T and used several different variations.   They've come out creamy and great every time.  I've been asked many times for this recipe.

I made this recipe as is. It did yield enough tasty mashed potatoes for 2 to 4 persons. The recipe is good without any further modifications. If you prefer a more more smooth bland flavor just ad more milk, but I did not. I served as a side to Ossobucco.

I would rate this 5, but they didnt really taste like mashed potatoes to me. If you have ever made beef stew with potatoes in it, this is what the mashed potatoes tasted like. They were good and REALLY easy, but didn't really taste like CREAMY mashed potatoes. I would make again

Surprisingly good!  When I was putting everything into the crockpot the morning of I thought for sure this wasn't asking for enough water but it was fine and perfect!  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and put the garlic on the bottom so that it would be roasted garlic when all was said and done.  That got mashed into the potatoes just fine (like butter when it's roasted, afterall).    I will use other reviewer's suggestions in the future and add cheese.  And I think that it might be better with russets than with reds, will play with that in the future, too.

My family enjoyed these. While it's not any easier that stovetop mashed potatoes, it does allow for some of the prep work to be done a head of time.  I used peeled russet potatoes and skipped the garlic powder.  I cooked them on low for 6 hours. They were done, but 7 hours would have probably been better. I drained off the liquid from the crockpot before mashing and added milk, a giant spoonful of sour cream, more butter, and minced garlic.  The consistancy and flavor was good.

This sounded yummy, so I gave it a try. I added more garlic than suggested in the recipe (2 tsp. minced garlic instead of powder). I might add sour cream next time too, as other reviewers have done, but I can recommend this recipe with confidence! I used Russet potatoes, since I had plenty of those (peeled) and minced garlic as stated earlier, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I liked the outcome and will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out surprisingly well!  It's really hot right now, so I'm using my slow cooker at least 3 times week to cook instead of using the oven.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and stirred them every hour.  My slow cooker is a new one and I was afraid that the potatoes would burn or dry out (they didn't).  My only change was to use about 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I also added three cloves of minced garlic.  When they were done, I used my handheld immersion blender directly in the cooker.  I also stirred in some leftover caramelized onions and bacon.  It tasted creamy and rich even though I used minimal butter.  I definitely wouldn't dump these in the slow cooker and leave them all day without testing it out first, because I suspect the potatoes might burn  or dry out easily.  This is great when you need some extra stove space, or when it's too hot out to use the stove!

Eck. I thought this would make my thanksgiving smoother. Maybe it needed more liquid? idk, it was brown and had a weird flavor, I was so disappointed because my mashed potatoes are always so good.

2 lbs. of potatoes was not enough for our crew so I altered.  Honestly, I may have screwed it up BUT, no matter what, this was a LOT more work than regular, boiled mashed potatoes.  Definitely WILL NOT TRY again.

Very easy, very delicious! I've made these quite a few times now. Next time I make them, I'm gonna top them with some cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and a dab of sour cream and pile em' beside some barbeque chicken!

I'm new at making mashed potatoes and my first attempt was a complicated recipe so I gave this one a try on a weeknight.  I turned my newer slow cooker on high and the potatoes were done in 3 hours.  Good basis recipe, I added a little cheddar at the end.  Will try again but add the sour cream others suggested.

I made these potatoes not long ago and they were incredible.  My entire family loved them.  I loved that I prepared them in the morning and didn't have to do a thing to them all day.  Perfect!!

used 5 lbs of baking potatos, 3/4 covered w/ chick broth and garlic.  Pour off excess when done (save a little in case they are too dry) and smashed in slow cooker pot.  Added seasonings and turned on warm.

This is a perfect recipe for holidays when you are trying to carve the turkey, make gravy and get everything on the table at the same time.  I have made it without the garlic, especially if we are having gravy.  You do need to keep an eye on the liquid level.  It can evaporate too quickly and leave you with scorched potatoes.  I also use one clove of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.

This got rave reviews from the whole family, and was a perfect match to our grilled steaks and roasted corn on the cob for Memorial Day. 
You rarely read such a thing for a suggestion but make sure your black pepper is OLD! We use a fresher pepper than can be found in grocery store spice aisles and 1/4 tsp was jsut WAY too much! Had I been thinking I would have reduced it. But that was MY fault not the recipe's :). As far as changes go I used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. The leftovers (what few there were) were great fried the next morning at breakfast. Thumbs up on this one!

very easy! nice to let the slow cooker take care of things...the just mash it up in the mixer when you're ready! I added some sour cream to give it a little more depth of flavor, but it was still delicious! Will add as a regular!
**Update: I continue to follow the recipe exactly. Just a head's up...I always leave the skins on baby red potatoes... it does make them a more grayish color, but they still taste fabulous. Also, since i leave the skin on, i leave them slightly chunky when i mix them in the mixer. Took to a party and they were a hit. It's just nice to not have to worry about watching potatoes while the boil, etc... just do the prep before work, then quick and easy mixing when you get home.

My daughter said she thinks we won't be able to go back to the old way of making mashed potatoes after having these yummy potatoes. I used reds but without the skin b/c they had quite a few blemishes.  Put 5-6 cloves of garlic in the bottom of the crock, cubed the taters and added other ingredients as instructed and cooked on high for about 3 hours.   I could have eaten the potatoes without mashing - they were that good.  I did mash them though, adding some cream cheese as suggested by others.  These were even better the next day.  Thanks!!

With this many good reviews, I must have done something wrong. But it turned into a dark, gluey, bitter tasting mess.  The only thing I did differently before trying to salvage it was add a little extra garlic since I LOVE garlic. That shouldn't have made that much of a difference. I found it inedible.  I won't make this again.

I made these for Easter dinner as written except I left the skin on the potatoes and used less butter at the end (about 2 T). They were delicious and creamy.  Even my Mom who is extra picky liked them!  Plus the extra time it left me to prepare everything else was wonderful :)

I always screw up mashed potatoes and these turned out perfect.  I used the high setting and only needed to cook them for 3 hours (they started to get a bit burnt).  I also added about 3t. of crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder and used (6)russet potatoes.

I went with this recipe because I'm all for easy on busier days. Throw the potatoes in the crock and let them go! This will be my new mashed potato recipe! Served with chicken fried steaks and salad, we had a great dinner. I did add sour cream and cream cheese to these and they turned out fantastic. Mashing them with a masher was soooo easy and effortless, no need for a mixer. I usually screw up mashed potatoes, but not these!

Delicious and super easy.  I made this for Christmas eve and it was nice to just let the slow cooker do the work while I focused on all the other dishes.  I used baking potatoes and peeled off all the skin.  Instead of the salt and garlic powder, I used a little garlic salt and fresh minced garlic.

I made this recipe just as directed. Smelled wonderful but didn't look very appealing. They don't turn out light and fluffy. Tasted good the first time, but leftovers were dense and not appetizing. I think this recipe would work well for a group of 8, with no leftovers.

we love the simplicity. peeled and quartered 7 yukon potatoes, added water (covering potatoes 1/2 way) in crock pot, few whole garlic cloves and sprig of rosemary. turn on high, went to soccer practice and came home 3 hrs later- potatoes nice and soft (without any grayness). drained excess water, removed sprig, mashed and added milk/butter/grated parmesean cheese/salt to taste. easy, peasy and good.

Made this for my family of 6. I used  peeled russetts instead of the red potatoes but followed the recipe other than that. They were a hit. My 8 year old grandson said they were awesome and he's picky about potatoes! Using this for soccer practice nights when supper has to be ready when we get home. Love the simplicity!

I think this recipe is a good basic recipe that is versatile to how you want your mashies to turn out. Meaning you could omit the garlic, or add other herbs and spices to your liking, use a different kind of potato, add cream cheese if you want...etc. Just keep the liquid measurements  for cooking the same and you really can't go wrong.

These came out good.  I didn't mash them, I just used them whole.  I'm not sure that the full cooking time was needed, I turned it to "warm" once the potatoes were cooked.

Very good recipe but I had touble getting them to mash smoothly.  I wanted the texture of the skins but no lumps not sure why I couldn't get the lumps out.  I will be trying this again though.  We love garlic mashed pototoes and this was super easy.  I loved using the slow cooker to cook the potatoes.  It made it easier to do other things right before dinner.  I followed the directions mostly but did add 8oz. sour cream and 3 oz. cream cheese to try to get some of the gumminess out from beating them so much.

I made this recipe as part of our Thanksgiving meal.  Delicious!  I put more butter than the recipe called for, and I also added some cream cheese.  We'll be using this recipe often!

I made this tonight as a side dish and no one really cared for it. I would much rather just boil the garlic and onion with the potatoes and mash it together and add chives. Turns out with a lot more flavour

I thought these were kind of bland. I love the idea of using the crock pot cause I didn't have to mess with them but next time will add much more seasoning.

After reading one of the other reviews, I decided to use Russet potatoes(I'm not fond of red potatoes). The recipe was easy, however, it was not like I expected. I initially was looking for a recipe to use for Thanksgiving but I opted for making mashed potatoes the traditional way.

These were pretty decent.  I used red potatoes and may have overcooked them a bit.  When I went to mash them up, they were really soupy.  Luckily, as they cooled down, they firmed up a bit and were quite a nice consistency.  But they were also this really ugly brownish color.  Did NOT look appealing with the rest of the meal.  Oh, I also kept the skins on.  So I would be willing to try it again without the skins.  But you can't beat the ease of slow cookers.  It's so helpful when you have other things on the stove and in the oven.  One less thing to worry about.

I used 3lbs of potatoes and added extra broth and seasonings equal to potatoes. I also substituted 1/2 package cream cheese and 1/3 cup sour cream instead of milk.

I wouldn't not make this again, but I wouldn't decide to make this over the traditional boiling method. After reading the recipe and a ton of reviews it seemed like the recipe was alter-able and a lot of the reviews were on the cooking method. So I altered to fit the way I like my potatoes flavored. I used chicken broth instead of water and a lot more garlic. The end result tasted pretty good. But I ended up using a LOT more salt than I normally do, and I can't figure out why. The texture is also quite a bit more dense than I'm used to. And finally, these somehow taste "slow cooked". Like they might've been cooked with a a roast and then mashed up and altered, if that makes any sense. Which is not bad. But since it only seemed to take out the boiling the potatoes step, and I prefer the potatoes after being boiled, my preference is the old fashioned way.

This was OK but I found that the taste was very crock pot flavoured potatoes.  I used Yukon gold potatoes and they didn't look very appealing when I got home.  Perhaps using a white potato would be better.

These potatoes, although very good, were not any different then any mashed potatoes I've every made (using red potatoes). I probably wouldn't make them again, the reason being; I don't think it's necessary to make mashed potatoes a labor intensive side dish.

I love garlic and I moved mashed pots..but this was just nothing special. Honestly it can be done in a regular pot, doing this in a slow cooker didnt seem to add any great benefit. Plus by using the slow cooker for this...I dont have it for the main meat dish. Too bland to me as well.

I made this for a camping trip with the Cub Scouts and it was a HUGE hit!  This is a great recipe if you need a crowd pleaser, since it is pretty basic.  I think the slow cooker really got the garlic flavor into the potatoes.  I will definetly make this one again.

This is a great, quick way to make mashed potatoes.  I also added some seasonings to taste and also added butter- as usual, not the healthies option, but the boys love it.  Very good and quick to prepare!

These turned out okay. Used a tad bit more water and they still really didn't turn out that well. Used Russets instead of red potatoes.  Used also minced garlic which could have used more. I would make again but reduce the time.

I followed the recipe just as it said, except made a larger quantity for our large family.  These had a great flavor, and a consistency more like a "smashed" potato. Because of the other reviews of a not so attractive brown color, I only left the skins on one or two of my potatoes and peeled the rest.  I gave these a "3" because my husband didn't love them.  I think he was expecting a more traditional creamy mashed potato.  However, I really liked them.

These turned out really well, aside from the colour, which was greyish.  Even though they didn't look that appetizing, they tasted great and were gobbled up at my potluck party last night.  I would definitely make these again to have ready for a family dinner on a busy weekday, but might think twice about serving to guests only because of the presentation.

Thought the potatoes were bland. Minced garlic may have been better, I happened to have some extra sour cream and added it to the potatoes, helped a bit, but wish it had more flavor.

This is a great recipe. My family loves it, and there are usually none left. I did alter it though because it did not turn out well for me in the slow cooker. I boil my potatoes on simmer with the same amount of water. Once they are tender, I let the butter melt on top then I proceed to mix them according to the recipe.

Very easy.  I placed enough water in the pot to barely cover the potatoes.  When the potatoes are tender, just drain off some liquid and mash.  Good to make when the stove's busy with many other items.

I just came on here to try to figure out what I did wrong to the recipe.  They just didn't try out right for me.  Very bland.  I added a lot more garlic to try to help it.

Since I didn't peel the potatoes, it was not pretty & white. But it tasted great! Lots easier than normal mashed potatoes.

Was just ok. I used 3 cloves fresh garlic and let it cook with the potatoes, then mashed it all up. Flavor and texture were alright, but not worth making again.

These, in the words of Simon Cowell, were just "alright".
