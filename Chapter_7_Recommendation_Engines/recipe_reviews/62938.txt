I served this cocktail to a a group of friends, who had various tastes. It was a hit with everyone. Perfect balance of sweet/sour taste. Pretty pink color, and it was the only one out of several recipes we tasted that earned a second pitcher request.  Use a good quality grenadine, it is the key flavor componet in this drink. Will keep this recipe as a permanent favorite/

Very good. I don't know if I've had anything like this before. I really enjoyed this. Second one I made, I added an additional finger of tequila.

Don't know if it's becuase of the brand of sweet and sour I used (Daily's); but there was way too much sweet and sour for my taste.  I ended up adding water to dilute the overwhelming pungency of the sweet and sour.

This was delicious.  I did use just one more ounce of tequila.  Wouldn't this make a great drink for July Fourth?!

This drink is very good. Quick to prepare too. Now next time I might add more sweet and sour because I found it a bit too sweet.
