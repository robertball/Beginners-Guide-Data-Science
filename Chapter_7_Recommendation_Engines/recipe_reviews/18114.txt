They were fairly easy to make, but I thought they lacked flavor.  I used butter instead of an egg wash, but I don't think that made much of a difference.  I think they need more salt.  I tried the recipe a second time, and I made sure I used salted butter.  I added another 1/4 tsp of salt to the recipe, and I also added some salt to the butter wash.  The turned out great, and were a big hit at Thanksgiving.

Very yummy!  I made them in my bread machine on the dough cycle and they turned out wonderful!  I am now using this recipe in place of pre-made crescent dough in other recipes.

These are super crescent rolls!  I was a bit worried about sugar being in the recipe, but it adds just a hint of sweetness, and they're still great with savory flavors, like gravy.  They have a rich, buttery taste and a light texture.  I've used the dough as a topping for casseroles and pot pies, and it works great.  It puffs up in the oven more than you'd expect.  You can also roll them up with bacon and cheese or tiny sausages before baking them and have a great snack.  The time spent on these is worth it! (And it always seems to take my dough a little longer to rise than the recipe states.)  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Excellent! I made the dough in my bread machine on dough cycle. The recipes does make more rolls than stated, unless you like ENORMOUS rolls. I did have trouble with the rolls getting too dark on the bottom before the tops browned, baking them at 350 helped. These are delicious,everyone in my picky family loved them.

Outstanding! I used bread flour rather than all-purpose and probably added an additional 1 c. of flour in the kneading process.  The first rising time was about 2 hrs. Definately will make about 24 crescents rather than the 12 the recipe yields.  Making 12 makes HUGE rolls! Did not brush the rolls with anything before baking and they were wonderful!

Yum Yum!! Made minor changes like melting the butter with the milk and instead of using an egg to brush the tops, I used butter. Based on other reviews I slit my dough 3 ways to make alot of little rolls, but to no avail. They seemed to just keep on growing. :-) But a great recipe and one where I had no leftovers. Thanks!

Great recipe.  Good looking rolls, easy directions.  You can make a softer finish by coating with melted butter, instead of egg, prior to baking.  
This dough is ample enough to produce even more rolls.  By rolling out in larger circles, you can get 12 good-sized rolls or 14 slightly smaller rolls per circle.

This is one of the best Crescent recipes I have found, and one of the tastiest.  Another variation I have tried is to butter the inside triangles and coat with cinnamon and sugar.  Makes for a superb breakfast roll!

Exceedingly yummy. I used half whole wheat, half unbleached wheat flour. They were light and slightly sweet and gone within minutes! The texture and flavor are similar to those of Parker House Rolls. Mmmmmmm.

Delicious!  I wanted to make "pigs-in-a-blanket" using crescent rolls and didn't want to use the store-bought crescents.  

TIP#1: If you want flaky rolls, 1)roll the dough out, 2)spread w/melted butter, 3)fold it, 4)spread w/butter, 5)fold, roll out and repeat.

TIP#2: If you don't want burnt bottoms, use an aluminum baking sheet W/O DARK BOTTOM, NO AIR-BAKE, AND NOT DARK NON-STICK.  Also, my oven has 4 rack positions: I put mine on the 2nd from the top which browns the tops better and gives the bottoms a little more space from the heat.  

TIP#3:  Proof your yeast first and it will rise in the time suggested.  Dissolve yeast in water as stated and add 1/2t. sugar; let sit in an oven that was preheated to WARM FOR 15 SECONDS (Don't forget to turn oven off after 15 sec.).  In about 10-15 min. the mixture should have doubled.  If it's done nothing, try again with different yeast.  It's okay if the recipe takes longer to rise than suggested--they taste better that way!  I let mine rise in the refrigerator all day.  

I also add only 3T. sugar in total and 1t. salt.

I accidentally overcooked these a little bit (I like mine golden, and they came out "dark golden", to say the least), but they were still nice and soft when warm.  These taste best warm, and become pleasantly soft again when re-heated.  My husband and I ate more of these rolls for dinner than we did of the main dish!

very nice flavor, easy to make (for a bread) stays soft for quite while after baked. For some reason, the dough didn't rise like should have, but I don't think it was the recipe's fault :) Yummy!

Your Butter crescents are eexcellent. What fillings would you suggest so that they are termed croissants or stuffed butter crescents?

Worked GREAT!  I even used cheap flour (the kind in a 25# cloth bag) and old yeast - yet it rose just like it should and made roles that 3 days later are still soft enough to eat!

A overall good recipe but tasted more like a cross between a dinner roll and a crescent roll but i think that is due to the fact that I dont have a hand mixer and stirred it by hand but my husband still loved it and i will be making it in the near future!

Although these do take some time, my family really loved these.  I sprinkled some garlic powder on them prior to rolling them up.  I served them with beef ravioli.

These rolls were really good.  Everyone in my family loved them.  I used whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour called for in the recipe.  Yummy!

These are wonderful, my family just gobbled them up.  They make a great base for cinnamon rolls too.  I have made these several times.

This recipe is a really good dough recipe.  I have used it for all kinds of things from plain white bread to cinnamon buns.  EVEN BUTTER CRESCENTS!!  Go Figure.

Excellent recipe!! I made rolls with one round and freeze the other for later use. Divide each round into eight wedges...they rise up and tastier when little small.

YUM!  The kids dug right in to these.  I cut the recipe in half and made 8 pretty nice sized cresents.  My only complaint is that they needed more butter flavor.  I only added an egg yolk, (because I had separated & used the white for a different recipe & cutting it in 1/2 called for 1/2 egg)... ANYWAY, I brushed butter on the top before baking instead of the egg.  Good recipe Rita, thanks.

These are so so so so yummy. I will make them again and again. I spread a layer of melted butter on them before I rolled them up as others suggested. I served them with chili for dinner and I think they will also be good for breakfast warmed with honey...I plan to try rolling them up with a brown sugar/cinnamon/butter mixture sometime too.

Ok, I've made this recipe about 25 times now, give or take.  To make them worthy of five stars, consider the following:

1) You need a bread machine.  I'm not strong enough to make a good dough by hand, but the dough cycle on the bread machine is.
2) Followed as-is, they are heavy and not at all like one would expect.  After the bread machine is done, remove dough and roll out.  Spread dough with butter and fold.  Spread with butter, and fold again.  Roll it out, and repeat until dough no longer "cooperates".  You'll see what I mean...at that point, cut into the triangles and roll up.  I reccomend cooking at a cooler temperature if you are having problems with them being done all the way through, 325 degrees works well.  Hope this helps!

These are a nice "dinner roll". Those expecting to end up with croissants or even Pillsbury flaky crescents are going to be sadly disappointed though. Croissants take a LOT of labor, rolling, spreading cold butter, folding, chilling and repeating several times to get layers of dough and butter which create the buttery, flaky layers. That said, I would never go to the work of making my own croissant dough, but these are easy and very tasty and something I'll make when I want a nice roll. SO much better than the frozen dough... I have better luck with bread from scratch, my frozen rolls NEVER rise!

These rolls are definitely worth the time & effort!  I first made them for a small dinner party and made them smaller.  Delicious!  For Christmas Eve dinner I made them a bit larger, and for a New Year's luncheon, I made them large for use with sandwiches.

I've been told that I am to make the rolls for every family event from now on!  My entire family loves them, and I love the compliments!

My family and I found this recipe delicious!!!  We found it on the sweet side, but not a sweet roll.  I made it to go with a spicy chili and it was a nice combination.  I only use whole wheat flour and thought it might be heavy but they weren't.  I had extra dough and going to try this as a loaf for dinner tonight.  I will defiantly make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is very tasty. Instead of making rolls, I used it to make a huge 12" pizza pocket with instead of using regular pizza dough (hubby doesn't like pizza crust). It came out very tasty and now hubby asks me to make this on a regular basis. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These are a great homemade alternative to store bought crescent rolls!  I have used them to wrap hot dogs, in various Pampered Chef recipes that call for crescent rolls, and to wrap up filling for breakfast pockets for my kids.  The dough is quick and easy to mix up in a KitchenAid and is so easy to work with.  I toss it all into the mixing bowl using hot water and milk(which melts the butter), and 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast rather than a packet and I have never had an issue with the dough rising.  However, I do think it needs a tad more salt.  I use unsalted butter so I up the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons, making it about the same as the ratio of salt I use when making bread dough.  If you have been looking for a homemade version of crescent rolls to use in recipes give this one a try.

OMG! so easy and so addictive! At first I thought the batter was a little sweet, but once baked, they are awesomely good!SAMME is right, worth the wait! I test receipes all the time as I bake for a FARMERS Market. I will be adding these to my weekly baking for the market. Only tweak, I didn't do the egg wash, they browned beautifully without it.

Wonderful! I tried this recipe for the first time a few years ago and used the bread machine.  They came out pretty terrible.  THey were hard and dense.  I tried them again last night and mixed them up by hand (i don't have a beater) and they were perfect.  We ate nearly the whole batch in one night.  My DH says i need to make them for company from now on.  I agree with the others that they are pretty big.  I think you could make 16 easy.  Mine puffed up like balloons and i didn't even let them rise as long as stated.  I brushed them with a little margarine before going in the oven and although it probably didn't do much taste wise it geve it a nice brownness.  I think egg is overkill sometimes.  I will definately use butter next time.

These crescents had a decent flavour but could have used a bit more salt. I wanted something different to have with my beef stew other than the usual biscuits I make.  For the time and effort I put in to these though I was disappointed with the texture.  They were too dense and doughy.  I'd rather stick to my biscuits or buy the pillsbury variety crescent roll in the future to save time.

This is my new roll recipe, I made it for Christmas and got 3 requests for the recipe.  My husband loved it, but it is time consuming. I will probably only make this on special occasions.  Note: this is not supposed to be a crescent roll dough, it is a dinner roll dough that is shaped into crescents.  Delicious!!

I scaled down the recipe to half. It supposed to make only 6, but I had made 10. I made 4 tuna buns and 6 crescents, all mini size. I wanted to try different flavour of crescent, so I made 3 originals, 2 with brown sugar and 1 with chocolate chips. All turned out nice, I prefer tuna bun and brown sugar crescent. 

Note: The brown sugar I used is different from what we normally use in baking.

These were amazing, I've recently fallen in love with cooking and I find a lot of recipes from this website.  All the ones I have tried have been great, but this one was incredible.  They were easy to make (i've never made rolls before) and they tasted DELICIOUS.  I made them for a party and everyone raved about them.  I definitely suggest this recipe!

I made these in my bread machine using the pizza dough cycle and they turned out wonderful.  I put turkey sausages (or cheese (babybel) instead of the sausages sometimes) in them. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I only warmed the milk in the microwave and let the butter melt in it afterwards.
I may even use this dough to make hot dog buns. make sure you leave enough space between the crescents while baking them because they get bigger.
next time I'll cook them at 190 degrees though, mine browned a bit too fast.

These were alright, but they're not anything like the crescents you'll get from the canned dough at the grocery store. These just don't have that typical light, airy flakiness that crescents usually have. I don't see how these are any different than dinner roll dough rolled into a crescent shape.

These are great!  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour (1 cup Bob's Red Mill, one cup King Arthur White Whole Wheat) and added a little vital wheat gluten.  I had to leave home, so it rose about 1 hour, 30-40 minutes the first rise, which was fine.  I made 16 large rolls- it just made more sense to cut each circle into 8 instead of 6 triangles.  The directions on this recipe were clear and easy to follow.  It produced beautiful, light, yummy rolls.  I brushed a tiny bit of butter on the rolls as they came out of the oven (omitted the egg wash).  Yummy recipe- try it with some whole wheat flour!

For some reason my dough did not rise(Any suggestion?), Maybe my water was too hot for yeast(not sure).But whatever it is, it's yummy anyway.

These are kind of heavy.  Honestly, they tasted more like dinner rolls than light and fluffy crescents.

I just made these rolls and we love them!  I think next time I shall take other reviewers advice and brush melted butter on before I roll them up to give them an added buttery flavor.  I think they could use something more in the way of flavor.  Otherwise they are perfect!  I definitely plan on making these again.  And again.

The crescents turned out well immediately after they were baked. But they turned slightly hard after a few hours. What could the problem be? The same thing happens when i bake other breads e.g. cinnamon rolls.

This is a good recipe that was a hit at Thanksgiving. It's worth the time to get that homemade flavor. I would recommend using salted butter for some extra flavor, though.

These are by far the best rolls, they have a nice soft sweetness to them. You can heat them up days after and they still taste great.

I have been searching for the supreme roll recipe. This one has a delicious flavor, nice appearance, good texture...but it just doesn't have the heavenly, airy, 'light-as-a-feather' quality I am looking for. I know it is possible because once I had some rolls that were so light that I vowed to find the recipe! I think it might have been a potato-based dough so I'll keep searching. But, this one IS yummy, but more like the usual homemade bread rolls.

Delicious! My family loves them, in fact, I'm making some right now! I use 1/3 cup honey in place of the granulated sugar and brush with milk instead of egg whites, and they turn out perfect every time! Thanks Rita!

I have made this recipe several times and have passed it on to family and friends.  I scaled the recipe to triple the yeild and I always cut it into 8 wedges(this gives me 4 dozen). They still come up large and are so good they never last.  We have taken them to group functions and there are never any leftovers.  My family also likes to slice them in 1/2 to use as a hot dog bun.  I froze some once after they were shaped, when It came time to use them we just let them thaw and rise.  They were good but not as good as when you use the dough fresh.  I also do not brush with egg.  Instead I brush with melted butter just before and just after they are in the oven.

I made the dough in the bread machine (yeast went in dry on top of the flour).  I made these into 18-20 simple round rolls instead of shaping them into crescents... what can I say, I'm a lazy cook.  They turned out very good.  The texture was super light and buttery- they almost melted in your mouth.  This texture would have been perfect for crescent rolls, since I like my round rolls to be slightly more firm (so I can butter them with out squashing them flat).  Next time I will take the time to make crescents.

These rolls are amazing! I did not make them by hand, though. I added all of the ingredients to my bread machine and let it do the work for me. The dough was a little wet, so I had to add an extra tbs of flour. In an hour & a half, I had a massive ball of dough. It made way more than 12 rolls. I had at least double that. And they rose up so high that I will have to roll the dough out a little thinner next time. I did not brush anything on them. They were very tender, flaky, and flavorful. Next time I make them, I think I will wrap some of those little weiner dogs inside.

delectable. I made in the bread machine on dough cycle and then used to make ham and cheese roll ups + dinner rolls. Fabulous. Slight pretzel character. I allowed to rise about 45 minutes prior to baking and they still puffed up quite a bit. I will use t his recipe a ton now.

These were very "yeasty"...but otherwise unflavorfull and they make WAY more rolls than stated if you want typical-size crescent rolls.  They weren't as light as you'd expect.

so easy and really good moist and fluffy. I filled some with chopped semi-sweet chocolate, and the others with milk chocolate b4 rolling into crescents. Make sure you stuff them well, cuz the chocolates melt down and the dough puffs up quite a bit! Really good and everyone loved them. thanks for this recipe!

These were awesome!  I brushed the circles with melted butter before I cut them into wedges and brushed them with butter instead of egg before baking.  I also made 24 rolls instead of 12 and they ended up being about the same size as the refrigerated kind you buy.  They were still excellent the next day after being popped in the microwave for about 7 seconds.  I'll be making these all the time.  Thanks a lot!

I used 1/2 WW & 1/2 AP flour, which always changes the texture of the rolls, I doubled the recipe, and made a dozen 3-part rolls, a dozen crescents, and 14 cinnamon rolls. Tried 2 of the cinnamon rolls this morning and they are tender and delicious. The remainder of the rolls will go into the freezer for convenient use. The recipe is simple and easy to make.

these were really soft and good. i would add more salt to them next time as they really seemed to need that to bring out more of the flavor (i might do the salted butter next time like someone suggested). i used butter instead of the egg wash, but next time i'll do the egg wash to make them brown on top.

I am AWFUL at rolling out dough... making biscuits or rolls but these came out great. The dough rolled out really well and wasn't at all sticky. Plus, they were even better the second day, reheated in the microwave or toaster oven.

This is a wonderful recipe that turns out soft, golden-hued rolls that pair very well with a subtle soup. I would add a 1.5 tspns salt than the 1/2 tspn recommended in the recipe.

I have used this recipe several times, and I love it! It's a great bread to accompany things like home-made chicken and dumplings or beef stew. They do make big crescents, so I usually cut the first round into eight sections and make those, and use the other half to make cinnamon twists for desert. *yum* A very versatile and delicious recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is very nice. Definitely make it again. I divided the dough into triangle shaped sections, but i figured that it would be better to roll it with a rolling pin cos when we roll up the crescents, it is too thick. They are gonna be left to rise for another 30 mins in the last stage so no worries for it to be not soft inside when baked. It worked for me and i get better shaped crescents like this. Hope this helps.

I made these with a roasted chicken dinner, and my family said that I should make these everyday! haha!! they ate them all up, nothing was left... these are very good... oh and I used Hi-gluten flour, used my kitchen aid to do the kneading... added more salt, and  made a honey butter (mixed honey with a stick of butter, rolled in plastic wrap, set in fridge.) I have a new family favorite... 10 stars!!

Good - just shy of great.  Not quite worth 5 stars.  But, very easy which I appreciate.  If you want a far star crescent roll & have some make ahead time and 2 potatos try Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls on this site.  Otherwise, this is a good second choice.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!! My family could not stop eating these. Good thing I doubled the recipe!! My only recommendation is to use only the egg white, not the whole egg, for coating the top.

I used this recipe instead of buying the crescent rolls in the store. Instead of rolling them out, I used them to fit in a 9X13 inch pan, so I could make a recipe similair to cream cheese danish. The nice thing about this is that there are no seams in which you have to seal. Thanks for the recipe!!

These rolls were excellent and the dough was a delight to work with!  I did increase the salt to 1 t. and think I would go w/ 1.5 teaspoons next time.  However, they tasted like my regular yeast roll recipe (but definitely better!), and not too much like crescent rolls.  I had refrigerated crescents the night before I made these so they were fresh in my mind.  The flakiness wasn't there, although they were incredibly soft.  I baked at 375 degrees for 12 minutes and they were perfect!  I will keep looking for a crescent recipe, but these did get great raves from the family and will replace my favorite yeast roll recipe!

These seemed like a dinner roll you'd get at a steak house.  Way better then the refrigerated/ canned crescent rolls.  I made 3 batches of these for Thanksgiving.  All my guest said they were great.  Recipe definately makes more than 1 dozen, unless you want really big rolls.  These are just as good w/out the egg brushed on.

Fabulous! For those that want more of a buttery taste:  spread softened butter on dough round before cutting into wedges.  My 9 year old son loved helping make these.  We made 24 medium sized rolls from this recipe.

I let the bread machine mix the dough, then took it manually from there. This is the best roll recipe I have ever tried. Great job! I did however, brush the rolls with butter rather than eggs, and also rolled out to the thickness of a pie crust and cut into about 16 rolls per round. They were the hit of the Thanksgiving diner this year.

not like pilsbury but these taste great. thought they'd be a little more buttery in taste but they're actually like sweet rolls. and they're really soft! I put ham/sliced hot dogs, cream cheese and chopped jalapeno peppers in some of them and OH MY GOD that was some good stuff!

I'm a newcomer to making bread however I felt that this recipe did not live up to expectations that I received as a result of reading the reviews.  I was expecting more along the lines of a croissant, I was sadly misled and disappointed.  The rolls themselves were too floury in my opinion, I would not make these again.

I do not cook with yeast very much but this is really easy and I have not messed it up yet. However, you need to double the salt. These also freeze great.

Good recipe-a little time consuming, especially for a novice bread maker like me, but the results are worth it. I have made these rolls several times, the only time I had a problem was when I made them on a rainy day. The dough did not rise properly, but they still tasted great. Thanks.

These rolls are delicious! They have a very subtle sweetness to them which my daughter loved. They were a bit difficult for me to roll out & I believe they should have been rolled a bit thinner, but they just kept bouncing back & I just gave in. But I will definately try again!

Fool proof and delicious. I've made these twice now and they disappear so fast it's crazy. Very fluffy inside. One note if you only cut your circles into 6 wedges be prepared to have some crazy big rolls. I cut them into 12 for smaller ones. I do typically have to let mine rise 30 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. Will be making over and over. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I spread a layer of butter on the inside of the circle when it is rolled out, leaving an inch unbuttered around the perimeter, then I cut and roll them. I also coat it in butter when it's fresh out of the oven and don't use the egg coating before baking. I brought these to  potluck last year and they were all gone before it was over.  They requested them again this year. Great go-to recipe.

Pure perfection!  Made my dough in bread machine, and made regular shaped rolls because of time restraints.  Loved the texture of the finished product, not dry at all.

Pretty good but it seems to be missing some flavor I think it might need a little more salt or something. I used half of the rolls to make pigs in a blanket with lil smokies and I baked at 360 degrees for about 18 minutes.

These were the best rolls I ever made! It was very easy, my 4.5 year old son helped me! I made one batch with homemade marmelade (just put one tea spoon of marmelade or jam on the broad end of the triangle before you start rolling it) and after the egg wash I sprinkled it with sugar. The other batch I made with hard cheese (cheddar or any chese you like), I cut it in rectangles and put it in the middle of the broad end of the triangle and then rolled it...after the egg wash I sprinkled it with salt... The third batch was plain (without filling) and jummy!!!

These are absolutely amazing. You will be hooked when you try these.  Don't let the sugar deter you from trying this recipe.  I followed it to the T except adding an additional 1/2tsp of salt. Great for savory dishes. Love these.

These rolls were pretty easy to make.  I used my bread machine for this recipe.  The dough was very smooth and very easy to handle.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and reduced the flour by half a cup.  I also replaced the butter with the butter that you can't believe it's not.  I separated the dough into 3 portions and rolling each portion into a 12 inch circle.  Use a pizza cutter(so easy!) to cut 12 triangles.  This way the recipe yielded 36 rolls and they were the same size as the ready made versions.  I froze 24 rolls on a tray and saved them for another time.  So for next time, just place the rolls on a cookie tray and place in a warm oven till doubled in size.  This is a definite keeper!  I left some leftover(I know, right? Not possible!) rolls out overnight and they were still soft the next day.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Awesome recipe :) But, I did choose to go the savory route. 
   I: let the dough rise twice, rolled the dough into rounds then sprinkled with oregano and fresh grated parmesan cheese before cutting and forming, brushed the tops with butter, then sprinkled with basil and seasoning salt. 
   I then sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top of that and baked at 350F until golden brown. I think next time I'll use cream cheese (be creative people!). All together these croissants were fluffy and delicious, I will definitely be making them again!

I am 13 years old and I made these. They were great!!! The only difference is I used 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and instead of an egg wash I used melted butter.

Delicious! So worth the time. I though that they were never going to rise, but it seemed like they did all at once. 
YUM! Can't wait ti make again!

I havent even finished cooking these yet, and I've just been watching the dough rise. Can anyone read of what? I do not care for this recipe! Ive had a hell of a time reading this recipe. Is it ONE egg? or two? It isnt straight forward. Plus, the dough doesnt seem to be rising, and it has already been one hour. Ive made cinnamon rolls, etc, recipes using yeast before and have never had any problems with yeast rising.

I used this recipe for the crust of the Taco Pie recipe from this site and it turned out great! I made up the rest of the crescents according to these directions and they made the fluffiest crescents ever! Now I have plenty for the freezer saved for later, can't wait to dig into them! Thanks for the recipe!

Best rolls ever!  I am the worst at making bread.  I always knead the dough by hand and end up using way more flour than the recipe calls for to prevent the dough from sticking to my hands and the board.  I just started using my stand mixer for kneading dough and discovered that it does an excellent job because it doesn't require any extra flour like it does when you knead by hand.  I used the exact measurements for this recipe and let the stand mixer do the work, then followed the directions and the rolls were extremely light and airy, excellent in flavor and were SUPER EASY to make.  I'll be passing this one on for sure. There's no need to look any further for a roll recipe.  This one is a keeper!

I stuff these with a dollop of nutela, brush them with butter, and sprinkle with a little salt and sugar. Perfect every time! Not to mention I make a batch of about 60 mini crescents and they are gone within 48 hours.

These were awesome! I made them for supper last night and they were good. I did have a problem with them not rising all the way in the specified time, which made them heavy, so next time I will be sure that I have enough time to let them fully rise. Even heavy, they were good, my husband could not believe that I made them from scratch, I do not usually make bread from scratch. This recipe will be a keeper in my family.

These are so delicious that I'm ignoring the stick of butter. They're perfect the day you make them, but then get a little hard the next day and don't reheat too well. I don't mind since there usually aren't leftovers anyway :)

Nothing short of excellent.  This is the only roll recipe I use now.  Make a double batch every time and put left overs in a zip lock bag...they may last a couple of days.  Thanks for sharing.

I think this recipe is more like a 4.5. Took longer to rise than the recipe called for, about 2 hours rather than 1. I also think they could be just a little sweeter, maybe 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3. To make them flaky I rolled out the dough then spread with butter, folded in half, spread with butter and folded again, then rolled out the dough and repeated the process once more time. I made 16 rolls from this recipe and they were still quite large. Overall they were very good.

Loved them.. I actually needed store bought crescent rolls for another recipe (Cream Cheese Squares by Ann on allrecipes.com) and didn't have any on hand. When I realized I had all the ingredients on hand for homemade ones I thought I would make them from scratch. I couldn't believe how much better my recipe came out with homemade crescents compared to store bought ones.

While I loved the texture and denseness of these rolls, my hub and kids were disappointed with the lack of flavor...we're all used to eating Pan de Sal rolls or King's Hawaiian bread though so maybe I'll try again just adding some sugar to the mix. Like all homemade bread recipes, these are a bit of work, a real labor or love!!

These are a FAMILY FAVE!!! My husbands family and my family love these! The only thing I do differently is I don't cook them for the full amount of time.I take them out before they are golden but they are still firm.And immediately after taking them out, I brush melted butter over them.If I make an Italian meal, I brush melted butter and crush garlic over them!

The directions stating how to roll them out were sort of confusing so I'll try to clarify them.  I first separated my dough into two balls. I then rolled one of the balls into a rectangle and then with a knife, I cut six long triangles out.  I then took one of the triangles, rolled it out a little more and then started at the base of the triangle and rolled it to the left and then once it formed the typical "Crescent Side" I went to the other side and did the same.  I then stopped and rolled the crescent straight.  Basically, you just take your triangle of dough and roll it at the bottom, go to the left, and then go to the right, then go the center again.  Then put the point side down on your baking sheet and let it rise again.  Overall, the flavor was okay.  They are very soft, which is what I like.  I think I next time I'll cut the butter in half.  It's too much for my taste.

These rolls were soft and had a great taste, but I found them a little heavy.  I took another reviewer's advice and used only the egg white to brush the top, and they came out very nicely browned.  I will make them again, but next time I think I will knead the dough more to see if that helps with the texture.

Just like those yummy restaurant rolls!  These rolls are pretty big, too, so I sometimes cut my circles into 8 wedges to make 16 smaller rolls instead of 12 big ones.

These were pretty good.  I actually liked them a lot better the next day or thawed from the freezer.  Right out of the oven I thought they tasted too yeasty.  The consistency is very nice though.

These rolls were fantastic!!  I let my breadmaker to the work and just rolled and baked.  I served these for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about them.  I hadn't found a dinner roll recipe that I really cared for,  but now I have.  They were even good the next day.  Make these rolls,  you won't regret it.

These turned out light and fluffy. There is not a very strong buttery flavor, but these cresents aren't bland. One thing to note--you could make a whole lot more than 12 cresents with this recipe. I'd recommend cutting the dough circles into at least 8 pieces each instead of 6. If you do just 6, the rolls turn out HUGE.

This were fabulous.  I only had yeast that was slightly dated, so they didn't rise for me as much as they should ....but they were still great ..my kids loved them.  I can't wait to try them again with fresh yeast.

These are awesome. I made this recipe years ago and just did again for Thanksgiving. I added a cup of wheat flour in place of white, used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3, and ran the dough cycle on my bread machine. I tore the dough off and flattened it into rolls rather than make crescents. I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes  They still came out perfect and delicious.

Such a yummy roll! They have a nice, light, fluffy texture. The only change I made was to sprinkle coarse sea salt over the rolls after they have been brushed with the beaten egg. I think the salt balances the slightly sweet dough and elevates them to perfection!

These were good.   The family loved them.   I had an issue with the dough not rising after I made it.  I’m thinking it may have risen some before I finished making it because I had plenty to make normal size rolls.   I will cut these in 8ths instead of 6ths because they are easier to make similar size.  I’m not always that talented.  Lol. I cooked 10 minutes.  I agree that a little more salt would be good as another reviewer suggested.  I will make them again.

Turned out great.  The next time I make these, I will roll the dough out a little more to make the crescents a little thinner.

It was ok, but nothing spectacular. Was dense, and not fluffy and buttery like I'd expect a croissant to be. Will try other recipes.

Great recipe. We've used this dough for crescent rolls, but also used it for parker house rolls (roll the dough into rectangles, butter the rectangle, then stack layers of buttered dough and cut it into cubes that bake into rolls), pigs-in-a-blanket rolls with little smokies, simple dinner rolls, and sweet breakfast rolls (cinnamon rolls, caramel pecan rolls, even chocolate rolls!). 

A lovely dough, easy to work with, and a fantastic holiday treat. I usually combine the butter and milk when warming them, then pour the mixture over the sugar into the mixing bowl and add the water and yeast directly to the mixing bowl, using the water to bring it all to the right temperature. The yeast proofs in the mixing bowl and just saves me a step. I use my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook for most of the kneading. We only knead by hand because my kids and I find it fun. My kids love working with this dough to make their holiday treats.

This is indeed a melt in your mouth roll!  I made the dough in my breadmaker and it turned out fabulous. I did make a few changes. 
Doubled the salt  to 1.5 t, based on other reviewers
Cut back on the sugar by half based on other reviewers
Decreased flour by 1/4 C based on other reviewers  
Also, I made 4 rounds instead of 2 as others said these rolls are huge.
Finally, on another reviewers advice, I wanted these rolls to have the flakiness of the store bought rolls in the can, so when I rolling out the dough, I rolled into my circle, then brushed with melted butter and folded the dough in half, rolled again and brushed with butter, folded rolled brushed again, folded rolled and brushed one last time.   I brushed with salted butter.  Then I cut and rolled up my rolls.  Let rise until double and then baked.  I baked on 350 for 16 minutes and YUM!  Final result was beautiful however next time, I would probably use the full sugar and regular unsalted butter.  I think the result with then be perfect.  The texture of these using this technique was SO wonderfully light and flaky!  Could not have been any better, they literally melt in your mouth!  If I could give these 10 stars I would.  

I'm not sure what may have occurred when others said these rolls were heavy.  They are not heavy in ANY way!  Maybe they didn't let them rise enough or somehow missed something in the instructions.  These are wonderful and I HIGHLY recommend them!!

I have been making these rolls for years. I always get asked to bring them to parties. They were a little bland, so I doubled the amount of salt and use butter instead of the egg wash. Turns out perfectly every time.

I have used a similar recipe before and used shortening instead of butter ( it is from an old cookbook like that) it also used melted shortening brushed on the dough before rolling up into triangles and then brushed on top after they are rolled up. This is our family's Thanksgiving roll  we have used for 40 plus years.

I have made these many times and they are stellar!  Once you've made these you'll never make those rolls in a tube again.  Just delicious-- my sister was nuts about them and said don't give me the recipe cause I can't control myself with these around :)   If you ever have a problem with them not rising it's the yeast.  I made two recipes with a certain yeast from Trader Joe's and they didn't rise but still tasted good.  I've never had that problem with the yeast I buy in the jar.  Now any recipe that calls for rolls in the tube I just whip these up instead.

Maybe I did something wrong, but every time I make these from any recipe they don't come out flaky. I followed the recipe of folding and chilling but maybe I need more practice.

I have used this recipe for a couple of years now and it always works great! Cinnamon buns, pizza dough (omit sugar and add herbs), all different shapes of rolls are great!

THESE ARE SO YUMMY! I DID A BUTTER BASTING BEFORE GOING IN THE OVEN AND THEY(IMO) WERE WAY TASTIER!

these were amazing! i added some cooking time and a lot of flour since the dough was sticky, nothing else. truth is, i was expecting the more traditional sweet not bread like ones but nonetheless these rolls came out crispy and delicious!

Excellent!  Made Chicken Broccoli Braid w/ this.  More like roll dough than crescents (not light and flaky).  Tastes great!  Brush w/ egg white and it looks fabulous!

I've been using this recipe for years for holidays and specials meals.  It is a family favorite.  Those who said these are bland or lack flavor must have screwed up the recipe!  Or, maybe they cheaped out and tried margarine instead of real butter.  These are soft and delicious!

They were a little too sweet but they were very easy to make. Unfortunately they were so bland that my family opted for sandwich bread at dinner. I did try them with a little margarine on top and it improved the taste but not enough to make me want to make them again.

I made these per the original instructions. They turned out beautiful. I had no idea crescents could be so easy. Received rave reviews by my family and by friends, who in turn asked for the recipe!

Soft and fluffy rolls. Stayed that way for 3 days too! I used half white bread flour and half whole wheat bread flour, yields a much better texture than using all purpose.

Fantastic! I cut back the sugar to 2TBs because I needed to make a crust for Mom's Zucchini Pie off this site and it came out wonderfully. I had enough to make 6 rolls on the side and my brother has offered to pay me to make it again tomorrow!

DELICIOUS! Best crescents I have ever had in my entire life! And they were SO easy to make! I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons because my family didn't like sweet things very much, and I increased the amount of salt to around 2/3 teaspoon. Then I baked the crescents at 400 degrees F for 12 minutes without bothering to brush anything onto them. They turned out splendidly! Fluffy, soft, and had a slightly crunchy golden crust...I can't wait to make those again!

These were awesome! I divided the dough into 2 parts, then cut the circle into 12 pieces.  I froze the rolls after shaping them (without letting them rise the second time).  I let the rolls sit out on a baking sheet for 30 mins. before baking (they still only took about 12 mins).

This recipe is one of my all-time favourites!  Very impressive flavour and great depth.  I usually roll out the dough until it is about the size of a large pizza, then cut it with a pizza cutter into eight equal portions.  Sometimes I add sprinkle garlic powder and parsley over the layer of butter before I roll them into shape.  Delicious!

This recipe was yummy and easy. I doubled the recipe and got 24 crescents. I also added mini smoked saugages to it and were a big hit for my kids. Great recipe! Thanks

These are a decent roll.  Not too heavy.  I usually substitute 1/2-1 cup whole wheat flour for the AP flour.  I use some extra butter including spreading melted butter on the triangles as I roll and kneading in some extra butter into the dough.  Still, I wouldn't call these buttery.

Decisions ... decisions; between this and Golden Crescent Rolls* as they are both so similar, I had a time of it trying to choose, lol. Ok, used this recipe and followed only #3 instruction from the other (GCR*). Doubled batch and got about 40 rolls (huge if 12 only per recipe); larger circles of dough and cut smaller wedges. Tried baking them in jumbo-sized muffin pan (12 cups - stand the ready crescent rolls on one end in and push it down from the other end) and they looked like cinnamon rolls. I also buttered the rounds before crescent-ing them and again, hot out the oven.  Now, that's butter crescents, lol. Also tried making (halal) sausage rolls and that worked too. Soft, tasty, (don't skimp on the salt unless using salted butter) and oh so bakery-pretty. Very versatile and wonderful dough, love it. Thanks Rita. Thanks reviewers (esp. the tip about the oven's temp). Hope this is helpful.
