Seriously... there isnt any coconut in Smores and where's the graham crackers? I melted the marshmellows as instructed. Am I the only one who had it solidify on the beaters? After working through all the problems I found these cookies to be only passable and really not worth the effort that went into it. I VERY much wanted to love these... my wife and daughter liked them but prefer my chocolate chip cookies. I won't be making this version again. Sorry

Wow am I surprised at how these turned out. Maybe it's my inexperience, but I didn't enjoy heating up the marshmellows...lol If you're mildly dumb, then I suggest buying marsmellow creme. Also, the batter seemed a tad bit dry and hard to mix after a while. But most of all, the taste was AMAZING and they baked really well. Everyone loves them, and I do as well. Chewy goodness. Be a kid again and dunk them in milk. Thanks a lot!

A very interesting version of chocolate chip cookies.  The marshmallow is very subtle and lends a chewy texture to the cookie. The coconut might be better slightly toasted before being added next time. I will definitely make these again!

Very good and different. My husband liked how the coconut cut the sweetness.I used 1 cup semi-sweet chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. They baked golden brown and are a great twist on regular chocolate chips cookies.

This recipe is a great twist on the traditional chocolate chip cookie. It's soft, chewy and truly delicious.  Follow the recipe as written, and you won't be disappointed.

Very good, made these last night...I might try making them with marshmallow cream instead of melting the marshmallows to save time. They turned out to be nice and soft, my hubby loved them.

This is a great variation of a chocolate chip cookie. I found that melting the marshmallows in the microwave was much easier - just put in the microwave on medium for 30 seconds, stir and addl 10 sec until all is melted.

Good cookies.  I will definitely make these again.  I would suggest giving these cookies a very long time to cool before trying to remove them from the baking sheet/tin foil.

I cut the flour by 1/4 cup because the amount looked too much for the recipe.  The texture was nice, but they were way too sweet for my taste.  I probably won't make these again.
