This was easy and very tasty.  I used basmati rice also and dry curry powder.  I didn't have lemon grass, but did top with green onions.

This is a very easy recipe and tastes really good. The rice when cooked has a mild yet flavourful and authentic Thai taste. It will compliment any spicy curry like a Thai red curry. However the only modification I would make is to add about half tsp of salt and maybe another lemon grass stalk. Will definitely be making it again.

Tasty...  I added 1 tsp. of brown sugar and I used brown rice  instead of jasmine, which took a good 45 minutes more to cook  and I had to keep adding water 1/2 cup at a time, so next time I'll precook the rice in a rice cooker... then I threw is some cubed tofu at the end.

This was awesome. I used Basmati rice and dried curry leaves (Can't get Fresh ones here) and picked the Thai Basil fresh from my garden. Served it with a Thai Noodle salad and Panang Beef curry.  This rice complimented the curry nicely. Served it to company who we had for their first Thai Dinner. There were NO leftovers !

The ingredients are great, I'm not too sure about these measurements however. I thought it needed more lemongrass and it was waay to sticky for my taste; more like risotto than rice. I took out a whole cup of water too and it was still that way. Where the heck do you buy curry leaves anyway? I had to leave that out but was still pretty good regardless.

Rice was mushy, but flavor was good.  If I make this again, I would use less water.

This one didn't thrill us. As written, there wasn't much flavor, so I tried increasing the flavorful ingredients, but we just weren't happy with the end result.

Everyone in my family loved this. I had trouble finding lemongrass stalks and fresh curry leaves, so I substituted the lemongrass with zest of one lemon and the fresh curry with dried curry. Even with the substitutions, it came out great.
