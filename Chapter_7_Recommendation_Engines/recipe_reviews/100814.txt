first, thank you for the good reviews. And, babbini ur totally right, when i submitted this recipe to the site , i put red curry powder, and u can substitute it for cayenne pepper too, but i think it was a typing mistake, they deleted the word red. And u can substitue galangal by ginger, however don't skip the lime leaves or the lemongrass, it makes a big difference. thanks again!!

Easy on the brown sugar, I would put a tablespoon. Also we couldn't find lime leafs so we zested a lime instead. Just as good in my opinion.

oh my gosh- it is authentic and tastes just like the one at a local restaurant!  
Aince I eat Thai but rarely make it, I asked an asian friend to pick up some of the harder to find ingredients-asian mkt only.  
Galangal is apparently VERY close to ginger so you can use it interchangably.  And the curry should be red Thai curry not the regular kind...
This is delicious!  Thank you for the  recipe.  Please post more!

I've had Thom Kha Gai in many great Thai restaurants and this rivals the best.
I'm sure it would have been even better had I used Kaffir leaves but couldn't find them at the grocery store.  I also substituted ginger for galangal.  I used half the mushrooms required which was a good amount and used chicken instead of shrimp.  Can't wait to make this for company.

This was a huge hit amongst all my friends. I went heavy on the lime leaves, galangal and added fresh basil from the tube (in the refrigerated section). Substituted chicken for shrmip and chicken turned out very moist. Before straining out the herbs, keep tasting broth until it tastes flavorful to you.

This recipe is the best on AllRecipes.com. I cannot believe I made such authentic tasting Thai soup, just as good as a Thai restaurant's! The only changes I made were 1- used yellow curry instead of red 2- couldn't find kaffir lime leaves so used a whole lime rind instead and 3 - added baby corn to the mix. This soup is gonig to becomea staple when I need to impress visiting family and friends. Thank you so much!

Like many other reviewers, I could not get all the ingredients for this recipe. Even so, it still came out tasting just like the Thai Coconut Soup I get from my favorite restaurant without hurting my wallet. This recipe makes a fabulously rich soup that is a treat for the senses.

FANTASTIC!

This soup came out oh oh ooooh so good.  My roommate who never had Thai loved it!  The smell alone was stunning!  A true dish for the senses!

Just a few things though:
1)the serving size i chose was for 8 yet it only was enough for 4 of us (and we are not big eaters)
2) The galangal amount was a tad too little.  Next time I will probably double it.
3)  I used regular yellow curry powder and it still came out good.  I will try Thai red powder next time.  I couldnt find it so I had to go with the regular yellow one.

I couldn't believe how close this tasted to my favorite Viet/Thai restaurant. I added more vegetables and chicken and it came out soooo good. You can add pretty much anything to this soup and it will come out delicious. I thought that the recipe called for too much liquid so I cut back to 1 can coconut milk and 1 cup water but I was wrong...the soup is what makes this dish so good.

Wonderful soup. I was amazing at the amount of flavor, but not at all overpowering. My family and I loved it!!! Even my mother, whose isn't a big fan of shrimp, and it was a nice gift for my wife for our wedding aniversery. I will most certainly make this soup again. I highly recommend it. this is a nice hit

OMG this soup was delicious and I believe tasted so authentic. I was able to find lemongrass and galangal and my local farmers market that caters to the cuisine of the world, literally. But opt not to spend money on items I would only use in this recipe. The red curry paste that I bought had all the ingredients that I didn't purchase already in it. Yay for saving money. I put some oil in the pot and fried the curry paste for a little then added chicken to that removed the chicken then added chicken broth and the coconut milk and then added all of the ingredients it called for. I also added fresh cherry tomatoes cut in half for color and fresh snowpeas. I used sliced mushrooms that were on sale. And added some cilantro. This recipe was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone.

My husband and I made this last night and agreed it was the best soup we've ever had and definitely the best we've ever made ourselves!  We used ginger instead of galangal, zest of 1 lime instead of lime leaves,only about 4 ounces of mushrooms,red curry paste instead of curry powder, and we added rice noodles.  The only thing we'll do differently next time is add about 1 more teaspoon of the red curry paste for just a little more zing.  It was delicious and we're having it again tonight.

Very Good - authentic to a degree. DO NOT use lime zest instead of the Kaffir leaves they are very important to the flavor and freshness of the soup. I started with Chicken Broth, sauteed onion, lots, red pepper in a garlic ginger paste available at your local Indian store. Used a red curry paste, sauteed with the onions and red pepper, really brings out the flavor. Use an authentic Asian palm sugar melted in water. Use equal amounts of coconut milk and chicken stock. The soup does not need to age, make today, eat today. Ground lemongrass is available in most Asian markets, making the taste more concentrated than using the stalks. Good soup tho!

I added 4 cups of water instead of two, one of those cups being chicken broth not water. Otherwise, its too heavy, and the coconut taste is too strong. I also added two finely chopped green peppers and 1 cup of finely chopped mushrooms. Tasted pretty good.

Good recipe but I wuold drop the curry powder (not Thai) and use fresh not dried chile.  You can leave the chillies whole and remove before serving.

If youcan find kaffir lime leaves at the local market buy a bunch and put the in your freezer till needed.

The best I've ever had. I did use chicken instead of shrimp, and subbed the zest of one lime for the lime leaves (made a half recipe). Can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was great.  Of course, I did read the reviews and modified a bit. My one local Asian store did not have lime leaves.  So I took the advice of another viewer and used the zest of a lime.  I also added the lime shell to the pot once I took out the juice.  I added more fish sauce and added Red curry paste (lots.)  I like that spicy/salty/sweet taste.  I used Palm sugar (I have that, I'm sure brown is fine, but I like the Palm Sugar.)  I did not precook the shrimp.  I added it at the end. It added a lot of shrimp flavor to the dish.  I cooked it for a few minutes on simmer and the shrimp was so sweet.  For leftovers, I took the shrimp out and heated the soup without the shrimp.  I dropped in the shrimp to the heated soup.  This way it does not dry out the shrimp and still so sweet. I also added a 1/4 cup of cilantro which I love in Thai cooking.  I also took the shells of the shrimp and cooked them with water to get a great shrimp broth.  Will be using that in a Tom Yum soup. Thank you for this recipe.  YUM. Next time I will double the soup, as I will freeze the soup and add the shrimp as needed.

This was awesome. I used lime zest since I had no kaffir lime leaves, and subbbed chicken for the shrimp ( as that is what the Thai restaurant I first had this at used...)  Topped it with chopped cilantro. Wonderful!

Excellent.  I found all of the ingredients at a local Asian store, except I used yellow curry. The only thing I will change is to add cooked tofu and maybe some carrot or baby corn. I think it needs more veggies.  This recipe is very flexible, as long as you stick with the basic recipe on the broth. I did not use shrimp. Very quick and easy to make. I'll double the recipe next time because it was so good!

This recipe is so tasty and incredibly easy to make! I used ginger and lime zest, and the soup still turned out fantastic. Thanks danadane for the awesome tip--I only used 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Fabulose!  I will definitely repeat this one.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I did not have the lime leaves, but I did add the zest from an entire lime.  I also subed ginger.  I used about 1-1/2 teasponns of red curry paste instead of curry powder.  The red paste has ginger and lime flavors and adds a nice bit of zip.  Can't wait to make this again.

This was soooo good!  We love Thai food and had this soup at our fave. Thai restaurant.  I was craving this soup so I decided to replicate and this was it! Do NOT substitute for the true asian ingredients.  That's where all the delicious flavor is at...we got ours at the Vietnamese store so any Asian market should have these basic ingredients.

Same as in a restraunt! I love it!  Thank you!  Also, for those of you who had trouble finding the kafir lime leaves, at my store they kept them in the freezer in little baggies.  They told me they keep longer and just to pop them in the dish when I needed them.  I thought that was good to know! Thanks, again for a yummy dish!

Very very good..the one change was using Mae Ploy's Panang curry paste rather than [uck!] stale old powder..but, a real keeper that I'm making as a light welcome home soup for my globe trotting daughter and super professional chef son-in-law..which should tell you how much I hold it in esteem..oh, I don't add as much sugar, about half, without hurting a thing. I also add the raw shrimp at 'reheat' so as not to overcook them.

This is my new favorite soup that I make! I did not use any meat and extra mushrooms and used one can of light coconut milk. I used ginger instead of galangal, but everything else per recipe, which gives it the amazing flavor. I am not done with my batch and already want to make more! I also garnished with fresh cilantro, yum!

I do not think this is any exaggeration to say that this is the best soup I have ever tasted. Based on other reviews, I used ginger in place of the galangal. The lemongrass and lime leaves are essential. I also used one can of regular and one can of lite coconut milk, and used red curry paste in place of the curry powder. The flavor in this soup is incredible. Thank you so much for sharing.

Love this recipe, I used 1/4 c. dragonfly brand instant red curry paste, it has great flavor without the over powering you with spice. you can use any veggies you like, I personally like bamboo shoots, eggplant, zucchini, and green onions. simmer till flavors infuse and fresh tomatoes at the end are great too. if you like it a little thicker you can use a little coconut cream
. this is totally one of those recipes you can tweak and it still turns out fabulous! just a tip if you don't use fish sauce you need to add salt to taste.

I had to substitute ginger for galganal, and couldn't find kaffir leaves.  I used ginger and basil instead.  While it probably had a different taste than the recipe intends, it was still delicious.  The red pepper flakes on top made it perfect.

I think that this recipe is great. I rated it at a five b/c I think it would have been a five if I hadn't tried to be a bit healthier and use lite cocount milk. It was a little bland, but with full flavor milk, it would have been dreamy! I also replaced the shrimp with tofu when I served it. very tasty.

This "Authentic Thai Coconut Soup" was quite delicious. I made a special trip to an Asian market near my home to get red curry powder (as per the first review by the submitter of the recipe) since I had never heard of red curry powder before. The Chinese owner told me that I could just use regular curry powder, but a hot version. I consulted with one of my reference books on herbs and spices, and could only find curry pastes listed under Thai cooking. I will continue looking for Thai red curry powder in my local Asian markets because I really do want to make an authentic dish. Thank you MIREYZ for sharing your recipe.

I made this soup, and it turned out better than a restaurant! It was surprisingly easy to make as well.  I would have given it 5 stars but the fish sauce made our kitchen smell pretty bad, and now I am forbidden from making it when my bf is home.  Tasted amazing though!

Loved the ease and deliciousness of this recipe. The hardest part was finding the lime leaves and figuring out what is galangal.  The woman at the store was pointing at the syllables and pronouncing them very slowly and loudly when I was trying to get assurance that is was, in fact, the ingredient I was searching for.  I have not tried any variation on this recipe as it is amazing as it is and the search for the ingredients was a lot of fun.  Yay Asia!!

When we visited Thailand in April, this was my favorite dish, so upon my return home, I looked for the recipe with the best reviews.  I was truly grateful for finding a good recipe & I made it according to the recipe, except I used oyster mushrooms instead (I had it in a local thai restaurant not in Thailand with regular mushrooms and they are too strong...in Thailand it was always the oyster mushroom).

Two changes I would make according to what we ate consistently in the Bangkok & Krabi regions of Thailand & we even cooked this ourselves at the Smart Cook Thailand cooking school in Krabi.

1) Use oyster mushrooms, they have a milder flavor, this is what you find in Thailand.
2) Don't use so much lime juice, if any at all.  When we cooked it, we used the lime leaves, no lime juice & none of the places we ate this in Thailand tasted this limey!  Obviously, if you don't have the lime leaves (which according to the Thai are a critical ingredient! you should zest some lime or use a little lime juice to get just a hint of the flavor, but the soup shouldn't taste like lime coconut)

I have noticed, however, in local restaurants it will be called coconut lime soup...maybe this is limier & not the same as what we were eating in Thailand, but all other ingredients were the same.  Also, in Thailand, they leave all the lemongrass, ginger, lime leaves in & you pick them out when you eat it!

Thank you for a great recipe to start off with!

A few reviewers suggested adding some chicken broth to lighten it up and I did the same.  I shopped a food market where I could find the items.   Threw some spinach in at the end and served over cellophane noodles.  Yum.

I made it with splenda instead of sugar and I omitted the galangal because I could not find it at my Asian supermarket. I also added chicken broth and used chicken instead of shrimp. It turned out to be extremely scrumptious! I will definitely keep this one as a favorite.

I used this recipe as a base, with a couple changes: Since the shrimp's not too cool to eat here, (Thanks a lot BP!) i used scallops, clams, and tuna. I made the broth all the same, but ginger instead of galangal, zest instead of lime leaf, and left out the curry powder. when I cooked the clams, i used 1/4 cup water/coconut milk mix to steam em, and added all that juice to the soup as well. The tuna, i seared up a filet after marinating it in a oil/thai chili/lime sauce, thin sliced it, and laid it out on top the soup. Delicious! loved how it was all limey-fishy. My bf was super pleased to come home to that :)

As good as any Kom Kah Gai I've ever tasted. I zested a small lime in place of the leaves. I used 1/2 the amount of shitake's called for and it was still too mushroom laiden. Next time I would use 5oz for 8 servings. Cut the brown sugar in half and taste, adding more as necessary.  I made it a second time with local honey as a sweetenter substitute.  Also added 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 a head of broc, 2 carrots, 1/3 onion and garnished with some fresh basil leaves.

This was a HIT! Only change was lowfat coconut milk and a ton more red pepper since we like spicy foods. Do NOT omit the lime. It really tops this dish off. We used all authentic ingredients since we have Asian grocers local.  The galongal and kaffir lime leaves really make a big difference.

Great recipe...as good as my local Thai restaurant and my husband says better!  I would make some changes next time around though!  I used half shrimp, half scallops.  Also used giner root.  Could not find the lime leaves, will try lime zest next time instead.  I used a half pound of mushrooms as they are very expensive, and that was plenty!  I would cut the brown sugar in half, this is a little too sweet.  I used yellow curry, but bet the red or cayenne pepper would be much better.  Also, in an attempt to duplicate my favorite dish at Fire Bowl Cafe (the Thai Seafood Tom Kah Soup/noodle bowl), I made some other changes!  I added about 4 oz. vermicelli noodles already cooked along with the seafood.  It was really good, the noodles really absorbed the flavor!  Also, I don't think Fire Bowl uses curry, but instead uses some kind of red chili sauce, may try that next time, or perhaps the red curry or cayenne would be closer in flavor.  They also use cilantro.  This is delicious and one of the ultimate comfort foods!!

When cooking your shrimp (or chicken) use that same water (broth is even better!) for the rest of the soup! Someone else mentioned cook with shrimp shells still on and I will try that next time, thanks! My favorite Thai "red curry paste" (May Ploy) HAS galangal, lemongrass, Thai red pepper, and a lot of other yummy stuff in it! I use at least a TBS of that, use more if you want to add more "heat". Also make sure to get the actual galangal, lemongrass, lime leaves for the best results! The flavor improves the longer you simmer those in broth! I add the coconut milk near the end of cooking because I read it does not like to be boiled and may curdle. I love adding veggies (onion, carrots, tomato, mushrooms, zucchini, bok choy, Broccoli, etc) to this soup, cook them till tender, it makes EVERYTHING you add such a treat! Top with lots of fresh CILANTRO before serving.

OMG, this was so good, especially the second night! I didn't have lemongrass, so I put in parsley and a tad of lemon juice,  and I just used leaves off my orange tree in lieu of the lime leaves. Forgot I had fresh ginger in the fridge, so I used crystallized instead. I used about a pound of precooked salad shrimp plus a package of precooked frozen mussel meats, and just added them at the end. Also added diced multicolored carrots and portobello mushrooms in addition to the shittakes because I like more veggies in soup. Other than that, I followed the recipe, except I didn't put in any pepper because I can't do spicy. Husband loves coconut, so he adored this soup! We were lucky to have it the second night, and it was even better then! I also served it on top of udon noodles to make it a full meal.

Cutting back considerably on the mushrooms would make this a 5 star recipe for me. I love mushrooms but a whole lb was way too much. I added 2c chicken broth and a 3rd can of coconut milk and still had mushroom stew. Only other changes I made were using half the amount of brown sugar based on other reviews and 2 tsp red curry paste instead of curry powder. The soup base/broth was 5 star!

This is nearly inedible. It's so sweet that I can't taste anything else. Don't plan to make this again.

A versatile and delicious soup. I followed the instructions loosely, adding green pepper, tempeh, and carrots and omitting seafood. A delicious and hearty soup!

I loved it but made a few changes.  First - WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYONE ADD SUGAR TO A SOUP LIKE THIS???   Sorry for shouting but savory food should not be sweetened (IMO) - especially a quarter cup.  Just a pet peeve of mine.  Anyway, I did not add any sugar

  (2) Next - and this adds work but also flavor - I bought shrmp with the shell on & boiled them shell-on (after rinsing them.)  When they cooled, I removed the shells and put the shells back in the boiling water and reduced it to the amount required for the recipe.  The flavor is in the shells!

  (3) Instead of adding dried red pepper, I bought red Thai chili peppers.  I cut one up (seeds and all) and added it along with the galangal, lemon grass & lime leaves.  It was the perfect amount of heat.  I also skipped the curry powder because I only have Indian curry powder and wasn't sure if it would compliment the flavors.

  (4) And finally, I wasn't sure about the number of lime leaves.  I have a kaffir lime plant and like many citrus plants, the leaves look like two leaves attached end-to-end, but when I saw them in the store, they are already separated so one real leaf looks like two in the package.  I'm not sure if the person who wrote the recipe knows that.  I used 7 whole (double) leaves, chopped up and crushed.        The shitake mushrooms in my local Chinese grocery store were huge.  The recipe didn't indicate how thin to slice them and since I don't normally use shitake mushrooms, I wasn't sure.  I cut them th

I made it as written and it was great, but a little too sweet for my taste. The second time I made it, I left out the brown sugar and used my homemade chicken broth instead of water. I also have the advantage of having my own indoor Kiefer lime tree and fresh Kiefer lime leaves really makes a difference in any asian dish. Like a lot of soups, this is better the second day.

I did make a few changes because of food availability, and I added shoestring bamboo shoots as well as a little celery. I think it would be really nice with diced red pepper added just as it's served for a little pop of cool sweetness.

This recipe is my new favorite dish! I live in the middle of nowhere, but I managed to find all the ingredients without much trouble. The lemongrass was near the fresh herbs in the super market, and I went to a thai takeout/grocer and just asked them for the lime leaves and galangal. I cooked some chicken on the side instead of shrimp, but otherwise, I made it exactly as directed. It's a marvelous flavor profile. I will be making this frequently!

Delicious!  I could not find Kaffir leaves so I substituted the 10 leaves with:  6 fresh thyme sprigs, 5 fresh bay leaves, and 1 lime's worth of zest.  I also used chicken instead of shrimp and used that stock to replace the 2 cups of water.  To make it more of a meal I served over Udon noodles.  Will make again!

Wow, so glad I gave this one a try!!  It turned out great! Thank you for sharing! I used lime zest instead of kaffir lime leaves, ginger instead of galangal, and reduced the brown sugar to about 1/2 tbs only. It turned out amazzzing! Will try to upload photo if the option is available!

I just took my first crack at this, and it is really super delicious.  I do agree with a previous review about the serving size being a little small - it's probably scaled for those little bowls you get at actual Thai restaurants.  I also tried to stick to the recipe very closely but did swap out Key Lime leaves for the Kaffir (since I have a tree in my back yard), chives for the green onion garnish (in my yard too) and added a package of oyster mushrooms in addition to shiitake because they were on sale.  :-)  My only complaint/suggestion is to use only the shiitake caps, not the stems.  The latter are a little chewy and tough in the soup.  Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow night.  Yum!

This is a wonderful reciepe! Very easy and my boyfriend and I had fun gathering the ingreadients and preparing it. The aroma from this soup is awsome. We found an Asian Market and they had everything we needed. The Market owner suggested that we add to the reciepe cilantro. About a half of cup chopped. I have just recently experienced Thai cuisine and this reciepe is right on. I will make this again and again. Thanks.

I wanted to like this. I really really wanted to like this. But I didn't! I thought there was too much lime juice. Quite a lot of work and not worth it in my opinion. However, my husband liked it so thats why I gave it three stars.

I can't believe this soup came from my kitchen!!  Very similar to our favorite Thai restaurant.  I wish I could have found Kaffir leaves, and I think next time I'll use a little less curry, or try red curry as others have suggested.  A great recipe...thanks for sharing it!
