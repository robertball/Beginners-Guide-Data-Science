I used butter instead of shortening and it was just what I needed for my pot pie! Add a little sweet and it would be perfect for a dessert pie too! Edited to add: I made this using shortening instead of butter last night and I won't do that again. It made it difficult to use/roll out. I'll make it again but I'll use butter.

This crust was way too crumbly.  After refrigerating the dough, I had to let it warm up to even try to roll it out.  I'm wondering why the recipe says to refrigerate at all, since you have to let it warm up.  I won't be using this recipe again.

I love this recipe!  I have used a very similar recipe that calls for boiling water, but just regular flour.  I call it my "no-fail" crust.  Like all crusts, it's subjective to humdity.  If your crust is too dry/too sticky, it could be the humidity of your house and the amount of flour can be reduced/increased by spoonfuls accordingly.

This recipe made a tender, flaky golden crust for my turkey pot pie.  Definitely the best crust I've ever made, and oh, so simple!  Thanks for sharing!

I used this for a quiche and it was tasty, but I had some trouble handling it.  Next time I'll let it chill longer, I guess.

I tried this recipe and found that it worked very well. In fact, I'm using it tonight for a mince meat pie.

I am not an expert at crusts by any means. It's the one cooking/baking area that I am pretty weak in. This recipe is amazing once you get the method of handling this dough. I use it exclusively with the Chicken Pot Pie IX found on this site. The result is absolutely amazing.
I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, it is fine as is. If you
are using it immediately after mixing, be prepared to use more flour when you roll it out.

I used butter instead of shortening. The recipe was so simple and the dough was easy to shape. I will say it’s easier to work with when it’s warmer opposed to chilled. Hope my chicken pot pies come out good! **Edit** this crust was absolutely AMAZING, the best crust I’ve ever tasted! I never thought I’d be able to make my own pie crust, so glad I tried this! I’ll never buy store made again.

I also used butter instead of shortening and it still came out amazing-the taste that is. The texture on the other hand, not so great. I tried to work with it but very difficult to handle. Needs to be tweaked a bit. Maybe more water, i dont know but Im sure there are alot easier ones out there. Still on the hunt.

I love this recipe. It was easy to make and was very tasty on my home made pot pies. Though I did use butter instead of shortening. But it was still very good! LOVE it!! I made three little pot pies with one serving.

I have tried many pie crust recipes and tried this one out of curiosity. I had seen it once before for a meat pie from England.  It was hefty enough for a meat pie but nothing I would use for fruit pies. Not light and flaky. Very dense.

I have made this crust several times.  I use it for home made chicken pot pies.  It is really a great crust to use for this and my family loves it every time.

I used butter and it turned out really good. My mother swears she can taste the baking powder but I think she is just biased and only likes her crust. I thought this crust turned out quite nice.
