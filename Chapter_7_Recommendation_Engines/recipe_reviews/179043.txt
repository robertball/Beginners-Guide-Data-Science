I have made this for thirty years - really! I have never added the sugar, vinegar or worcestershire and I also let it simmer for about 30 minutes or more. The sauce gets darker and richer as it cooks and you may have to keep adding a little extra water as you go. Delicious!

I had two problems with this recipe. I used 1/2 inch chops just like the recipe called for and followed the time of 10 minutes on low and the pork was a little dry and over-cooked in my opinion. The second problem I had was the sauce was too watery. I even took the pork chops out and continue to boil down the sauce but the end result was still too wet. The positive is the sauce is quite tasty and tangy but next time; I think after I brown the meat, I would put everything in the oven and bake it at a low temperature to keep the pork moist.

I wanted something quick and easy and this was perfect. I did season the chops with a little seasoned salt before browning. They cooked for 15 minutes. It is amazing what tomato soup can do to a recipe

These were pretty good.  Easy to make.  I simmered them longer than 10 minutes though.  Probably about 30 minutes, while I was cooking my side dish.

I've made this several times and its wonderful! I leave out the Worcestershire sauce and use canned tomato juice we make instead of tomato soup and add a little hot sauce to it. They always come out juicy and tender. I also do as another reviewer recommended and let them simmer for at least 45 min.  Perfect!

I had to double the recipe so along with the given ingredients I also added a tbsp of honey and a tbsp of butter maple syrup and I used apple cider vinegar. When I browned the pork chops I added fresh chopped garlic to the oil. Made a wonderful meal that all 4 of my children ate. Definitely doing it again. :)

This was a nice and easy meal; however, I probably would never make it again.  The flavor was good but to me, was reminiscent of the BBQ sauce from the famous fast-food restaurant specializing in roast beef sandwiches.  I used red wine vinegar instead of white because that was all I had, and added a bit of black pepper.  The sauce was good over the pork chops and rice, though my boyfriend said that it wasn't a recipe he'd request again in the future - and I agreed.

My family loved this!  I served it over brown rice (for added nutrition and color, I added shredded carrots, minced onions, and finely diced red bell pepper halfway through cooking) and my 5-yr-old asked if he could have the leftovers for lunch the next day!

This was so easy to make! I didn't have white vinegar on hand, so I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar, and it still came out delicious!

I did not like the taste of the sauce, so I took out a can of mushroom soup and used that instead.

So quick and easy. Sauce was very nice, mellow and not acidic like I feared. Good with rice or mashed potato. 4 stars for taste and 5 for simplicity and budget. Definately a keeper recipe for me.

I thought this was just okay - nothing special. I made it exactly as written (using Uncle Ben's "converted" rice), and served it with a side of okra. I like pork chops fairly well, but this sauce was just okay. There was a good amount of sauce and maybe if I'd let it thicken I would have liked it better.
