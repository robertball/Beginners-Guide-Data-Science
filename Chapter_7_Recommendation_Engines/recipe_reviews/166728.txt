This recipe was wonderful.  I did not have rice krispies on hand so I used corn chex.  It was a hit with the entire family - even those who don't typically like salmon patties.

The Kellogg's photograph is a joke.  While this dish tasted quite good, the cakes did not stick together in the slightest, and (unusual for me), I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  I ended up scrapping the cake concept and stirred all of the broken cakes around into a hash.  I would not make this again.

I made this b/c I had a giant box of RK, and after discovering that the fam doesn't care for RK treats (:()... salmon patties it was! (thank you ingredient search tool). For anyone worried about binding- I didn't have any prob... with the following changes! ;) Pour liquid egg whites equal to 3 eggs (or 3 scrambled egg) over your RK, let em sit for a bit, and then stir everything together and sit again till they get nice and mushy and easily "pressable" into patties. I also grated my onion, and omitted celery (used celery seed instead). And for extra flavor, lemon pepper, garlic salt, and tabasco sauce! They stayed together nicely with those changes. Keep in mind fish/crab cakes are always delicate and must be flipped and handled with care. I really liked the "dressing" and I actually just chopped up the green onion and tomato INTO the dressing. twas very fancy looking- DH liked it. Tasted good with a side of spinach wilted in garlic and olive oil with lemon juice and salt. Overall- four stars for a creative, budget friendly idea
