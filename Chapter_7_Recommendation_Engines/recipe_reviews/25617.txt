This is OUTSTANDING.  Fun to make with kids, too!  I made the recipe as directed except that I didn't have cream on hand, so our topping was made with milk instead.  It was delicious!  The topping was starting to burn under my broiler after 1 1/2 minutes so watch it carefully.  Did I mention how good this is??  It would be great with some spiced whipped cream!

Ok, I made quite a few adjustments (sorry!!!), but it was a delicious cake, and I am sure it would be amazing as written as well.  I used 2 cups chopped dates and a half cup raisins.  I boiled the fruit in 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup orange juice with some cinnamon.  When I added the baking soda it had a mini lava effect like a science fair project (I didn't think about the acid from the orange juice and baking soda, oops), but not enough to be a mess, and it didn't ruin the flavor.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and I also added nuts to the cake. I messed up the topping the first time I made it (adding the cream to the hot butter wasn't pretty) so I just did a topping of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Anyway, my whole family loved this recipe.  They said they would buy it in a coffee shop.  I didn't think it was that pretty, so if I made it for company I would increase the recipe and make it in a bundt pan, or slice it like a loaf cake and serve with sauce and whipped cream.

My original username was LAUREL1 and this is my recipe that I posted in 2001.  The orginal recipe comes from the Ukrainian Church Ladies of Holden, Alberta, Canada cookbook of my mother's when I was a little girl.  It was and still is my favourite coffee cake.  The original recipe calls for 1/2 cup of raisins, not 1-1/2 cups.   Thank you, Corinne, for the photo.  I'm tickled.

Wonderful recipe! Followed it exactly and it came out beautifully moist and rich, but not overpowering (I was afraid it would be too sweet!). Was a big hit with the family and a HUGE hit with the colleagues :) Thanks for sharing!

This is the best coffee cake I've ever had. It's very moist. Instead of the topping I used sour cream icing.

I added burbon to the cake and about 1/2 cup of oatmeal.  Then I added burbon to the topping.  I liked the cake but it was even better with the burbon.  Oh, I used 3/4 cup of raisins - golden.

This was a splendid cake.  My picture (1 of 1) proves that we couldn't wait for a photo op to eat it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and would make no changes.  It was moist and delicious.  I will be taking the recipe to Australia to make it for my Mum-in Law. Many thanks for posting it Laurel.

Moist cake with delicious brown sugar topping (didn't add nuts due to allergy).  Could hardly taste the dates, because there were so many raisins.  I think this would taste good with a little cinnamon.

sweet and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the amount of walnuts for the glaze (I made cupcakes and wanted more of them). Will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic!  Moist, yummy.  Next time I will use less raisins and more dates.  We were trying to replicate a date cake from a local mediterranean restaurant and this was very, very close except they used honey in the topping.  Delicious!

I made the gluten free version of this cake for my husband. I used gluten free all-purpose flour, almond flour and coconut milk with melted butter for topping as substitutes. Yummy!
