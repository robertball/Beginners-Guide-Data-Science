This recipe is delicious. The chicken has a slight crunch and the sauce glazes all of it perfectly. This is a hit.

OMG!  I decided to become a member so I can keep this recipe.  I loved the soy-mayo combination and it was easy to make.  I didn't use much oil but just to cover the pan and it was fine.  The meat was crispy and tender.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Success! My 2 toddlers devoured this, despite me messing up the recipe a couple times. I didn't have Sake so I used rice win vinegar. I also misread and actually simmered the sauce that you're supposee to toss the chicken in at the end. Simmering brought out some of the sweetness though and made for maybe an even better final product, maybe? Would give 5 stars but it was a few too many steps for this frazzled mama. Other than that, absolutely delish.

Very nice. A little to much ketchup. Used white wine instead of sake.
Maybe a better name for this chicken would be sweet chicken...

This is a keeper! 
As usual I didn't have all the ingredients and had to improvise. I used red wine vinegar in place of Saki. And, I was short on mayo by a couple of tablespoons. I had some sesame ginger salad dressing that I used to make up the difference. It all worked! Every dish was clean.
Will make again with all the ingredients from recipe and see if anyone notices.
