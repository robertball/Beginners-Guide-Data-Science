Fantastic recipe and very easy. I added a little more spice to give it a kick. To make the most out of a while chicken, I used the crock pot chicken for the tacos and also made some tortilla soup for tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe.

It was a little on the salty side for me but the ranch dressing was an interesting flavor twist from the usual taco

These were absolutely amazing!  My husband was very skeptical as he is very picky about having good dinners, but he loved them!  We all did!  In fact, we’re having them tonight for the second time this week. Also, super easy!

I was looking for something to use up my rotisserie chicken and this was perfect. My husband really loved it and he’s not a chicken fan. When I make it again I would use less taco seasoning because it was more salty and spicy than I like.

This recipe is simple fast and delicious I bought a rotisserie chicken already made and shredded the meat and added all the fixings. I added Kraft southwest ranch dressing which was a little spicy added a special kick. Super fast, super good!

These turned out AWESOME.  Super easy and super yummy.  My husband and myself destroyed these and I am already thinking of when to make them again.

Made tonight and loved it. Next time I will be cutting back on the seasoning by about half to 2/3rds, it was just a bit much for our taste. Also several of our taco shells broke up so my husband and I gave our kids the good shells and we crushed up the broken ones turning our meal into a "salad". We topped with extra homemade ranch and of coarse added avocado (omitting the salsa). It was a huge hit, cheap, easy, FILLING, and delicious, definitely something we'll be making again.
