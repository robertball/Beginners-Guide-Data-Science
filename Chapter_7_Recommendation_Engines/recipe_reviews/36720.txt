This dressing was very good!  My market only had sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil so I used those and nixed adding the extra oil.  The boyfriend wanted me to add extra vinager but I opted not to and it was perfect.  Very healthy and tasty!

We had this exact salad at a party at Grand Central Station and I was SO xcited to find the recipe here! ....
It's become my favorite salad!  I've made it a few different ways now and this is my quickest & favorite: boil water in micro, drop in sun dried tomatoes for 15-20 min, drain, dice, throw back in glass (I just use a juice glass), add other ingredients (dice the tomatoes & add a dash of olive oil), let sit for 10-15 min for flavors to blend & that's all there is to it for a more chunky version & no messy blender or food processor.  I like extra balsamic for stronger flavor and I never use the carrot but I do sometimes throw pine nuts in.  I just LOVE IT!!!

Good taste, but I followed directions exactly and mine came out very thick...like a paste.  It doesn't even want to pour!

this was okay.  A bit too acidic.  Nothing special.

This was all right but I found the dressing a little thick for my taste.  Also, I could hardly taste the sundried tomatoes.
