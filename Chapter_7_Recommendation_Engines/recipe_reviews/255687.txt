I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth instead of water, doubled the cheese, and added breadcrumbs to the top. The recipe didn't specify what temperature to set the oven at so I set it at 375 and kept an eye on it, taking it out when the breadcrumbs became golden. Also, next time I make it I want to experiment with more spices because it was a little bit bland for my taste.
