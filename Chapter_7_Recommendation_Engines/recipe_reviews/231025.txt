It was ok - I put it in the slow cooker, which caused it to fall apart.  We turned it into pulled pork sandwiches.  The smell in the home caused my 2 kids, German exchange student and husband to all say they didn't want it...it definitely tasted better than it smelled. I likely won't make it again.

Very nice! I substituted Chardonnay for the water in step 4. Spring Onion is also known as scallions or green onion, I never heard of Spring Onion before, learned something new. Absolutely delicious recipe!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I am such a big German foodie, so naturally I just couldn't wait to try this recipe out. I made it tonight for our New Years Eve dinner and my husband absolutely LOVED it, as did I! I followed the recipe to a "T", only reducing the cook time from 2.5 hours to 2 in fear of overcooking. My gut was right, because it came out full of flavor and perfectly moist. Will be making this again, again, and again!

Delicious!  I modified the cooking time for my smaller pork roast.  I used the roast that comes packaged from Costco so it was very quick.

We made this as a crock pot recipe; just basically threw it all in (except corn starch, butter and green onion) with enough water to cover pork loin about 2/3 of the way.  The juices can then be combined on the stove top with the remaining ingreds for a gravy.  YUM!  Really good with creamy mashed potatoes.

My changes-
*Used white wine to deglaze the pan (instead of water)
*Made a half recipe (only three people eating here!)
*Fully cooked the pork, didn't feel safe with undercooked pork.

Next time: I would lower the oven temp to 325 so it could be in the oven longer. Might not be needed if you do a full roast.

This is awesome, but I think I'll just cover it in aluminum foil next time.  I'm not much into basting.
The only change I made was replacing the water with Pinot Grigio.

Wonderful Recipe.  This went over very well.  Will make again.
I took the Recipe (Ingredient list), substituted chicken stock  for the water and added potatoes.  I also modified the cooking instructions to cook in an Electric Pressure Cooker.

I made the recipe per directions.  It was very easy to make and turned out great!! The only thing I would change, would be double the amount of ingredients for the gravy because it was the BEST gravy Iâ€™ve ever had!!  Definitely will make again.

I've never deglazed a pan with hot water and I wasn't about to start here. Used chicken stock and cabernet, which added good flavor. However....
350 is too high for this; I used a 2.5 lb roast and after an 2.25 hours it was at 170, a bit overdone. As a result there wasn't enough liquid to warrant making separate gravy. Though the onions and vegetables with the juice made a great au jus. Next time I'll start the temperature higher and turn it down to at most 325 after about fifteen minutes of cooking.
Really like the flavor combinations. Not what I usually use for pork, and I rarely use caraway seeds at all, so it was good to do something different.

I made this for my son's girlfriend who is from Germany.  We liked it very much, it was moist and flavorful.  I used a shoulder/butt pork roast that was 6 lbs. so I doubled the rub spices and increased the liquid and vegetables accordingly.  A nice change from the usual ways I've made pork roast.

Came out excellent and tender. Cooked at 350 for 2 hours in the same cast iron pan I did the prep cooking in. I added celery seed.

I suggest substitute pork stock or chicken broth instead of using water. I have found in most recipes its much better to use stock instead of water!!!
