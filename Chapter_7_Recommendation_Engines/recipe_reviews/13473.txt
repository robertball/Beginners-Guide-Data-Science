I've tried already for 2days 4 different recipies of Pumpkin soup. 2 recommended onion, carrot, celery, garlic, or the milk/evaporated milk and onion. Since i'm not so much a fan of onion in sweet soup, others didn't appeal to me, but this one -my last try- simply amazed me. If you want to have sweet pumpkin taste itself, but sweet and creamy, you will love this one. I'm so glad that I finally found one.

I love soups made with winter squash/pumpkin, but what constitutes a "small sugar pumpkin?"  It would be very helpful to have a measurement of the actual amount of the cooked pumpkin.  Even the weight of the pumpkin would be helpful.

I used canned pumpkins instead. It was much easier and still very tasty! This soup will accompany our Thanksgiving dinner this year. Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

Very good soup. I used canned pumpkin to save time AND I also thought it needed a little extra flavor so I added some orange juice. Turned out fantastic! My dad couldn't get enough.

It's important to note that the recipe calls for SUGAR PUMPKIN, which is different from the generic, Jack O' Lantern pumpkins that supermarkets have for display. Ask the manager of the market or go to a local one to find Sugar/Sugar Pie Pumpkin.

This soup was excellent and easy to make for an unexperienced cook. The only thing I added was a little fresh ground pepper on top before serving. One thing that I think is helpful to know is that one blender full of pumpkin mixed with the 3 cups of chicken stock was the right amount for great tasting creamy soup.

Tip: cut your pumpkin into quarters after you clean out the seeds & wrap it in plastic wrap.  Then microwave & let it cool before you peel the shell off.  It will come right off & you won't burn your fingers.

Great basic recipe. I used it for a dinner party of 60 and had many requests for the recipe.  I used canned pumpkin and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and added the pumpkin pie spice another reviewer had suggested.  It is definately a keeper.

I added a just little poblano chili and ancho chili for spiciness for my Mexican husband. The sour creme didn't want to blend very well so I put the soup in the blender half way through the cooking process.  Amoung the fourteen dinner guests I had today it was a five with all of them! Thanks!!

I always make pumpkin soup with garlic and onion, but tried it with sage and nutmeg, as well as cream, this time.  I couldn't really taste the spices in my soup, but the cream was a great addition.  I also mixed in a dash of cayenne pepper and sprinkled fresh chopped parsley and fresh ground pepper on top.  A big hit.  No one thought it was bland, but you can always add more salt if need be.  I served it in a cooked hollowed pumpkin shell and the presentation was great.  I have heard (never tried) that curry is good in pumpkin soup also.

This soup was incredibly difficult to make.  After burning my fingers peeling off pumpkin skins and spending long amounts of time pureeing and preparing it, I was very disappointed in how it turned out.  My fiance, however, put  brown sugar on it and said it was amazing.  He also ate hamburger helper once that I made with vanilla soy milk on accident, so take that into consideration.

An easy recipe, but really bland, even after adding extra spicing.  I was glad for the sour cream as that was really the only tasty part of the dish.

excellent--as good as that served on Thanksgiving Day 2002 at Galveston's elegant Moody Gardens Hotel fete in the ballroom

However, I prefer the soup sans sour cream.

I made this and didnt change anything, other than using canned pumpkin in the recipe. When I put the recipe in my allrecipe's shopping list it called for SEVEN cups of pumpkin. I used 2 of the large cans of pumpkin puree and I didnt have an issue with thickness- it was very thick and creamy. I was a bit worried about the recipe- soooo many comments had changed so many things, but I decided to just follow it and it was very good- subtle, and delicious. I have had many pumpkin soups and this was the best I have had- it retained it pumpkin flavor. **If you are looking to slurp pumpkin pie, this isnt the recipe for you, but there are a lot of comments with sweeter variations. Thank you for the recipe!

Nice and rich, but very mildly flavored. I would saute a chopped onion at the beginning if I were to make it again. I would also add some paprika or even a bit of heat

Yummy!  Very easy to make.  It was a bit salty for our family, so will decrease the salt next time.  Used canned pumpkin, and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  We loved it, even the little kids!

Many years ago, I first had pumpkin soup at a restaurant in northern Minnesota. I remembered it had sage in it, but I was never able to find another recipe containing sage, so when I saw this, I had to try it. It was very similar to that first soup, with the following changes:

I pureed the pumpkin in the food processor, then added an onion that I had fried until it was soft, but not brown. I blitzed that a few seconds, so that the onion wouldn't be completely incorporated.

I left out the nutmeg, added another half teaspoon of sage, and a bit more salt.

I halved amount of cream, and didn't use the sour cream.

Now that I've found this, I'll be using it often!

I have been making this recipe for years and it'a amazing. I always use 2 sugar pumpkins plus a butternut squash and adjust the other ingredients by adding more chicken stock, cream and spices to accomodate the squash. The butternut squash makes it sweet, rich and more flavorful. I also add some cracked pepper at the end of cooking for additional flavor. If you don't know what sugar pumpins are, they are the same as pie pumpkins, which you can get at the produce section of most grocery stores and at farmer's markets this time of year. Delicious...give it a try!

I had a large amount of pie pumpkins and wanted to try something new. This was great I gave it 4 stars because I did a little tweaking. I added an additional cup of pumpkin puree because my family likes thick soups. I didn’t have any whipping cream on had so I used evaporated milk, I also added some onion, garlic, cayenne pepper and black pepper to taste. This was a hit with my 4 ½ year old and husband and we will be serving on Thanksgiving.

It was average, and only because I did a lot of adding on my own. After I followed the recipe, it seemed to taste to bland; so I added some cinnamon, brown sugar, some white sugar, and a peeled, cored, and cubed fresh apple. It tasted better after that. It gave it some sweetness.

I didn't care for the combination of flavors. However, I think it depends on one's taste.

Love this pumpkin soup & have made it
several times, changing it every time.
I have used pumpkin in the can, in addition, have put in 2 pre-cooked skinned yams. I have sauteed fresh baby carrots & they gave the soup a zing.
Yummy! Tonight for my community cooking club, I am going to try the spicy approach with the hot pepper flakes, topped with
the sour creme dollop, some mint (for show) & a sprinkle of paprika for color.

WOW.  Elegant.  Subtle.  Mellow.  This soup exceeded my expectations.

The only drawback is that the pumpkin prep is a bit time consuming, especially since, due to my small kitchen, I have a small Cuisinart and had to puree the pumpkin, then the puree and stock, in batches.  But it was oh-so-worth-it!

The sage and nutmeg were subtle.  It tasted like an elegant first course at a fine restaurant, really!

Very easy to prepare and easy to make in advance of serving, and I would recommend making the puree of pumpkin and stock and adding the whipping cream just before serving.  It also re-heats well.

Made recipe almost as posted (no whipping cream, used half and half).  Soup was alright.  Maybe I will add the onions next time.  I would also cut down on the sage.

1) very simple/easy to make. 
2) savory & satisfying for myself and the household consumers. 
3) I made this twice initially - first with a sugar pumpkin and second with a jack-o-lantern style left over.  Both were excellent, but I added brown sugar to the recipe with the more bland jack-o-lantern gourd.  
4) both were better when garnished with fresh black pepper. 
Enjoy!!  - definately worth trying.

If you are looking for a way to make this dairy free, you can substitute goat milk for the whipping cream and it turns out great!  I've made it both ways and I can't get enough of it!

I used about 20 oz of canned pumpkin, 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. the only thing i wish was different was the thickness. its a little to watery for me but overall it was good.

I thought this was very tasty! My hubby wasn't too crazy about it but I think he was expecting a sweet soup and this is not. Also, I used Pie Pumpkins which I've learned are the same as sugar pumpkins.

very easy.  Served without sour cream dollop.  Suggest eating it first night as sitting overnight did not add anything to it.  Pretty good but my dds (ages 2 and 4) did not like it.  Particularly good with toast.

I loved this recipe! I have always wanted to try pumpkin soup when I found this recipe I figured I would try it out. I love it. I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh. It is wonderfully creamy and rich. It is great with some soft dinner rolls or french bread. I added a little bit of pumpkins spice the second time I made it. It adds just a little more flavor. Very Yummy!

A lovely soup.  It's very easy to make yummy. I would add a little less sage and something a little spicy.  Pepper or red pepper flakes were a nice addition.

Very disappointed in this recipe. The chicken and pumpkin tastes do not go together well! I tried adding more cream and seasoning to detract from the chicken-ey flavor, but it didn't help.

I made this last fall and loved it. Put a leftover serving in the freezer and pulled it out in the middle of summer. After defrosting it, I tasted it and found that it is absolutely wonderful cold. A great summer soup and salad lunch.

Disappointed.  I was so excited about this recipe and even used other's suggestions for it (i.e. canned pumpkin, 1/2 and 1/2, and pumpkin pie spice) my kitchen smelled fabulous and yet this just did not turn out very well for me.  I was a bit pressed for time so I was looking for something easy which it was very easy to put togther but the initial upfront taste was bitter and unpleasant.  The aftertaste although was very good and tasted like pumpkin.  If anyone has any sugestions as to how to make this better I would welcome them because I absolutely love anything pumpkin!

Very easy to make! I halved the recipe, I'm cooking for just myself. The pumpkin didn't even take the full 45 minutes to roast, I think it took about 30. I let it cool for a bit, and the skin came right off, in two perfect pieces. Used the Magic bullet to puree the pumpkin and broth in two batches. I let it simmer with fresh sage (didn't have dried), nutmeg and salt. Added a small bit of heavy cream at the end. I didn't really measure anything, I didn't want to make a huge mess to clean, and it came out pretty well. I will definitely make it again with my other sugar pumpkin.

I double up on the nutmeg as I found it too bland. I also substituted the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt and sprinkled paprika on top. I will make this one again.

Loved this recipe! One thing I enjoy about allrecipes.com is being able to get some great ideas on what to make. This is a great recipe for a basic pumpkin soup but one can always tailor the recipe to your liking.  I roasted my own pumpkin and pureed once cooled.  I only used a few ingredients: chicken stock, pumpkin puree, pepper, heavy whipping cream and added Parmesan  cheese for taste. Absolutely divine soup..  will be serving it with croutons for lunch.  Definitely will be making it again :)

Loved this recipe! One thing I enjoy about allrecipes.com is being able to get some great ideas on what to make. This is a great recipe for a basic pumpkin soup but one can always tailor the recipe to your liking.  I roasted my own pumpkin and pureed once cooled.  I only used a few ingredients: chicken stock, pumpkin puree, pepper, heavy whipping cream and added Parmesan  cheese for taste. Absolutely divine soup..  will be serving it with croutons for lunch.  Definitely will be making it again :)

This soup is so good! I doubled up on the nutmeg and used thyme instead of sage because that's what I had. Hubby loves it!

It was really bland I think next time I would add some more spices like celery seed or something else salty.

Add some sausage or brats and make it man-friendly! Rosemary gives it a little something special too - not so overwhelmingly pumpkiny.  Most people go "eeeew" if you tell them it's pumpkin soup, but if you say "harvest soup" they are a little more apt to try it. I used cream once and half & half another time. Cream is far richer, but the later was easier on the digestion, waistline & wallet.  Tweek this soup up with other vegies if you don't like the stand-alone flavor of squash/pumpkin, & remember, you can use other squash varieties too. Even mix & match them. BTW: add some black beeans,pehaps a little corn and dried tomato & garnish with fried tortilla strips and make it mexican! Good basic recipe, but I don't like the pumpkin-only version. It doesn't have any nuanced scents or flavors...just pumpkin and terribly bland. As a base, it's fantastic!

This was easy to make, especially with canned pumpkin, but I agree with others that there was no flavor.  I even added extra spice, including pumpkin spice, but it didn't help.  It could be a good base for something though.

Several other reviewers had it right... there is zero flavor...  I couldn't taste the pumpkin, I couldn't even taste the chicken broth.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is it didn't taste bad... there was nothing to taste.

This soup was not good.  None of my family cared for it. The recipe is bland, and yes I tried spicing it up, but it didn't help it enough to eat it.

Too bland. Definitely needs onion, carrot, potato roasted along with the pumpkin and a touch of honey.

This soup was really bland.  Once I added some ancho pepper, garlic powder and onion powder it was okay, but nothing I will make again.

I was not too crazy aboput it.  It tasted rather bland. I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and maybe that was the difference.  It was better the second day.

This was incredibly easy to make, even for a kitchen novice like myself.  I used the recipe for 2 servings, using one small round, very dark green pumpkin.  I also added one teaspoon vegetable-based seasoning (such as Vegeta) and left out the sage.  It was delicious.
