This was a good, very quick, basic dish...but I did change it up a little.  I cooked 2 chicken breasts as instructed and when I went to make the sauce, I added 2 cloves of garlic which worked really well with the lime.  I also added the zest of about half the lime.  It's important to note that while I only used 2 chicken breasts, I made the full amount of sauce, and it was perfect.  As suggested by other reviewers, I did not use a 1/2 cup of butter but rather about 3-4 tbsp.  The lime zest was not necessary as DH and I found that the lime flavour was just too intense and the lime juice is quite enough.  A good recipe, but I would definitely add the garlic!

I have had this recipe for years, but have modified it slightly in much the same way as other reviewers.  I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces, use half a stick of butter, use about a tablespoon of fresh dill and some chopped fresh chives or scallions, and I add just a little flour to thicken the sauce.  This goes great with Uncle Ben's original wild rice and corn.  I love this because it is so easy to make that I can prep and cook while still keeping an eye on the kids!

This dish was yummy but the 1st time I made it, I thought there was way too much butter in it. The butter almost overpowered the lime flavor. Next time I used only half the amount called for and it was just as good or better. This sauce is also really good on cooked carrots.

Yum! We loved this!  I did change it a bit - cut the chicken breast halves into quarters, cooked them in just a little butter in a nonstick skillet (no vegetable oil).  Used 3 tbsp butter for the sauce, not half a cup, and used ground ginger instead of dill weed.  Served with rice and fresh asparagus.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was perfect!  I'll definitely make this again.

Wow.  I'm a pretty novice cook and a snobby foodie, I've *never* been able to successfully cook chicken.  With this recipe's simple directions, the chicken came out tender and juicy.  After cooking I put the chicken on a plate and put it in the microwave to keep warm. 

I used the juice of 1 small-ish lemon and about 3-4 pats of butter for 3 chicken breasts.  I loved the tartness, but I'm not partial to dill so I may substitue with something else (someone's suggestion of cilantro sounds delicious!)

Tasty! Personally, I feel like this lime butter would be better on a milder fish like Tilapia or even a Sea Bass filet, but overall it was pretty good!

Easy & well-liked by my husband (a huge plus!), I did make a few changes. I used one huge chicken breast & split it for us to share. Used the same amount of ingredients for the sauce EXCEPT for the butter. Yikes, a half cup of butter??!!!! I used MAYBE 2 tablespoons. Also to the lime juice I added two garlic cloves, 1/2 of a serrano chili pepper and maybe 1 tsp of shallots. Instead of the dill (not a fav of my husband), I used fresh basil. I will DEFINITELY repeat this one!

SOOO easy! and DElicious!  I got a "very good" and a "yum" from my husband which is saying a LOT!  I threw the sliced up chicken on a bed of spinach and used the lime butter as a topping/dressing for all of it. will make again soon-maybe tonight!

The family LOVED the chicken.  I used alittle less butter per the other reviews.  I also let the chicken cook in the sauce for a little while before I realized the sauce was to be cooked seperately (good mistake on my part!)  Instead of serving the sauce over the chicken, I used it to dip our artichoke leaves in it - This is the best dipping butter we have ever had.  I will definately serve this chicken with whole artichoke again and again!

It is the best.  I added 2 limes because I like a strong lime tast.

This was really good - I added extra lime because I wasn't sure the juice of one lime would be enough - and we like citrus!  I just made it last week and it has been requested again.  Followed the recipe except for the extra lime juice.

This wasn't the best meal I've ever had. I found the chicken to by dry, way too much butter and not enough lime flavor for my tastes. I served the chicken and sauce over egg nooddles. It gets two stars, because I at least could eat it without wanting to dump it and make something else.  I don't plan on making this again, but if I did I would thicken the sauce and add more lime, then adjust the amount of butter accordingly.

VERY GOOD! The chicken was rather juicy, and the flavor was a delight! The thing I did different was cut each chicken breast in half and also replaced the remaining chicken in the sauce to soak will waiting for the first person to claim them as seconds!  It was great, will most definitly make again!

Rated 4 stars as iis. I've made this very often, cutting down on the ingredients, it's easy to do one serving, and that is a big plus for me.  However, i would delete the part about draining excess grease, and add some finely-chopped shallots or green onion or whatever i had at that point and cook them until transparent.  Still, a very good, quick and easy recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this chicken. It was easy to make and I have a lime tree in the backyard so it was right up my alley. Be careful, I was chatting on the RE and almost burned the sauce. Thank You for a delish dish Leanne!

Delicious.  Light lime flavor.  Dill adds perfect finish.  Serves well as leftovers.  Rather than fry chicken in vegetable oil, we grilled the chicken on our Foreman grill, and then coated the skillet with a 1/2 tsp oil before making the sauce.

Excellent recipe! Next time, I will cut down on the lime juice a tad. Went well with the Mexican Salad recipe from this web site. Served with warm flour tortillas -- everyone just started combining the chicken and the Mexican salad and putting in the tortilla. Husband said he has never had anything like that combination of flavors. He was wowed and he really doesn't care for chicken. He said he would eat this anytime.

Overall excellent.  Would definitely make again.  Decrease butter to 3 TBSP.  Used 3 breasts but kept sauce mixture the same - wonderful.  Sprinkled breasts with pepper (no salt) and garlic powder.  Instead of serving the sauce over the chicken, I added some refrigerated minced garlic and let it simmer for 10-15 min.  Served with white rices seasoned with salt, pepper, dill and parsley.  Fussy family loved it!

This recipe is a long-time favourite of mine! When I first found it, though, I may have misunderstood the instruction to "drain excess oil", and found there to be too little sauce. I now keep the oil (in addition to the butter - ok, perhaps not a lean meal, but a great one) and find it works better. I often add a little extra lime juice and dill for extra flavour too.

this was a good recipe; my family liked it, but it wasn't a recipe that I would rave about. the chicken was nice and tangy with the lime, but also creamy and salty because of the butter. I liked it, but didn't love it.

This was delicious. Rather than just using one lime though, I squeezed in two to ensure that the dish was full of sour! It was so good, I would make it again for sure.

This was an excellent recipe. It was easy to prepare and the family loved it. At first I thought it was going to be too easy to taste good but I was the star at the dinner table with little effort. Don't be turned off by the combination of lime juice and dill. It works perfectly.

I used less butter, added garlic and used the amount of lime juice shown in the recipe.  It was good.

This is great with garlic added to the sauce and some sun dried tomatoes.  Reminds me of my favorite sauce at Bonefish Grill - Lime Tomato Garlic Sauce.  Key is to add butter SLOWLY.

It must be me because no-one else seemed to have a problem but I tried to make this sauce twice and both times the butter and lime juice separated so I had a greasy lumpy mess...not sure why - it seems very straight forward!!

So tasty! It is like something you would get in a good restaurant and be happy you ordered it. My family has requested I make it again. I also took another reviewer's advice and made the thyme lemon rice to go with it, and that turned out to be a great complement to the chicken.

This was delicious!!!!  I paired this with the Lemon Thyme Rice recipe that can also be found on this site, and the chicken and lime butter sauce over the rice was phenomenal!  Yum!!  We'll definitely be adding this to the dinner rotation in our household.

Great recipe!  Like the other reviewers, I used less butter - about 3 pats.  I didn't drain the pan as suggested because the chicken juices just give so much more body to the sauce.  I made string beans as a side and cooked them in the sauce for couple of minutes just to infuse them with the flavor.  Overall, a big hit at the dinner table.

My first attempt at this recipe I thought the butter-to-lime juice ratio was a little off. I doubled the lime juice and it came out great. Next time, though, I think I'll just cut back on the butter (1/2 cup is a lot!). My husband and I LOVED it!

We really enjoyed this chicken! I have never cooked chicken that way and it was so juicy! My boyfriend had me make it again for his friends! He made a cheese sauce to go along with it instead of the butter.

It could have been my really old oven, but although we followed the specified cooking time and temp. this was just way too dry. Might try again sometime on lower temperature.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  Hands down, this is one of the best recipes I've made from this site.  But then, I do LOVE lime, and especially the combination of chicken with lime.  I sauteed garlic with the chicken (used smaller, thinner chix breasts, so didn't need to cook too long).  Served with Penne with spring veggies from this site for an absolutely delightful meal!  THANK YOU for the post.

We really enjoyed this -  I did reduce the amount of butter which I think helped the tartness come through. I substituted cilanto for dill, just because that is what I had on hand, and it worked well.

I thought the lime added a nice flavor to the chicken, but it was bordering on being too over powering. Once in a while you'd get that extra tart bite. And there was way too much butter so I cut back to only 4 tbls. I may try this recipe again, but something's got to be added to cobat the tart in the lime. Perhaps rosemary.

Added garlic and ginger, omitted dill. Works best with thin, flat chicken breasts. They take in more flavor.

I added garlic, cut down on butter and used boneless, skinless thighs. Maybe it was using thighs that made it so greasy but I'll leave all oil out next time. I marinated for 1 hour in lime juice and garlic. We found it was very greasy and not much lime taste, will use more next time and maybe marinate longer as we like the lime flavour. Will make again, thank you for sharing.

I have made these time and time again. I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla just because I like vanilla. 

I have used this recipe for apple muffins. I replaced the bananas with half a can of apple pie filling and added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon. Every thing else was the same. 

I used this recipe for apple banana muffins all I did was add half a can of apple pie filling. 

I used this recipe for making peanut butter chocolate chip muffins. I added 1 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup with chocolate chips. 

I used this recipe to make banana blueberry muffins. I added 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. 

I just realized every time I edited it didn't leave a date. This is a simple muffin recipe. I have modified it several times for different events. I use the banana peanut butter one for funerals, the blueberry ones for births, the apple ones for new neighbors. I have used these for anniversary and graduations as well. I am no baker but a great cook and these come out perfect every time.

This was a great change to chicken breast.  It was easy to make and my family enjoyed it.  I did had grilled peppers and onions on top of the chicken before the lime mixture.  I was making  large pot of spaghetti sauce which I use pepper onions in so I also added to the recipe.
