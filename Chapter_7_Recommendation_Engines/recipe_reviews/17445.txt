I made these last night.  After reading a LOT of other member comments, I decided to marinate in EV olive oil, coarsley-ground pepper, kosher salt (only a bit of salt), minced garlic and a bit of balsamic vinegar, for about 2 hours.  Threaded on to bamboo skewers and grilled on the barbecue at a medium heat setting for a total of about 5-6 minutes.  Absolutely to DIE for!  THE BEST asparagus I've ever eaten.  My guest raved about them long after the meal was over.  Served with peppercorn-encusted strip loin steak, greek lemon pototoes and grilled red and orange peppers.

This is so great, we are big asparagus fans and this is one of our favorite ways to eat it.  I just learned a little trick in a magazine and it works fantastic for this recipe.  Soak some wooden skewers in water and then skewer together 6 or 7 stalks of asparagus all in a row like a little fence, using two skewers, one at the top one at the bottom.  They wont fall through the grate on the grill that way and they are easy to flip.

The simpler the better & you can't get much simpler or better than this.  In a ziploc I placed the trimmed asparagus & then added some fine extra virgin olive oil, salt & pepper & placed these babies on a jelly roll sheet in a 475 oven for 8-10 minutes, shaking them around after 5 minutes.  Once out of oven, I add either lemon juice or some grated best quality parmesan cheese.  YUMMY to say the least!

Great east quick recipe.  Missing one key ingredient.  Coat with olive oil AND balalmic vinegar!  This is key.  Same recipe can also be prepared in the oven. Prepare the same and roast for 10-15 minutes at 400...

I like using Garlic salt on the asparagus. Delicious! A nice trick is to use 2 skewers to keep your Asparagus grouped together. Makes it easier to turn them and prevent them from slipping through the grill.

Asparagus is my VERY favorite vegetable.  Have you tried baking or grilling it with Lemon Pepper (the kind with salt added)and olive oil? It's AMAZING! I usually "nuke" a bunch for 2 minutes in a tiny bit of water and add the olive oil and lemon pepper while it's hot.  I let it marinate for at least a half hour before grilling or baking it.  Try it - it's wonderful!

I put everything in a Ziploc bag, shook it up, baked them in the oven at 425 for 10 minutes on each side, and have decided that I will never steam asparagus again.  Enough said.  :-)

My new way of preparing asparagus!  This was excellent - although it does take longer then a couple of minutes on the grill.  I marinated mine in olive oil, pepper, balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and a dash of garlic salt rather then plain salt.

This is very tasty - I would never have thought to put asparagus on a grill.  My husband had mesquite chips in the smoker box the day I tried this, and it added a new dimension to the flavor.  I am the only person who really likes asparagus in my family, and while this didn't change anyone's mind, I enjoyed it very much!

Nothing fancy or fussy, but what great flavor and color! Fresh, simple and delicious.  No need to alter or embellish this recipe at all.  I used Penzey's shallot salt which I just love. Other seasonings or salts and a squeeze of lemon would be great too, but the recipe is perfect as is.

I made these for Memorial Day Weekend and they were really good with a few changes.  We Love Asparagus when it's cooked properly, and  I was Really Really hesitant to try our prescious Asparagus on the grill.  After reading a TON of reviews, we took the plunge! Cut an inch from the stalks,  and trimmed the stalks with a peeler.  Marinated with EVOO, Kosher Salt,  Fresh ground pepper and 1 1/2 tbsp good quality Balsamic vinegar -- popped in a Ziplock & let marinate for 1 hour.  We grilled these on high heat, on a small metal mesh grill pan  (less than a buck at our grocery store, and re-usable)... no skewer hassle either :D... Delicious!   Still crisp at 10-12 minutes -- another minute or two would have been even better.   Served with grilled steak and grilled corn on the cob...  Everyone raved about this long afterwards.  Thanks for posting!

Unbelievably easy & OMG tasty!! I used a grill pan on the stove so it took about 15 min instead of 2-3...my suggestion, however you cook it, keep an eye on it so it doesn't get mushy. I'm not known for getting my cooking time quite right, so I'm pleased to announce that I got this one PERFECT!!! Suitably crisp & seasoned to a "T"...yay me!! Happy Cooking!!

Excellent! Love the suggestion to use skewers. With all due respect, for those of you who tweak or completely change the recipe, why not add your own recipe to this site instead of tweaking someone else's?

Grilled Asparagus Haiku: "Asparagus win! Easy to make, tasted great. So good on the grill!" Followed some suggestions and tossed my asparagus in a bag w/ the EVOO, and S&P and let sit in the fridge for a few hrs. prior to grilling. I liked the idea of skewering them perpendicular (for ease of flipping), but didn't make the effort b/c I was timing the asparagus w/ AR's "BBQ NY Strip" as well. Turned out to be a fantastic dinner. Really, can a man's tummy be happier than when it's presented w/ steak and asparagus? Oh wait, I forgot the baked potato - next time!

This was sooooo delish!  Instead of using oil, we just sprayed the asparagus with garlic flavored cooking spray, and dusted it with some salt and pepper and cooked it directly on the grill!  Soooooo delicious with sooo few calories.  Definitely an addition to my bbq repertoire.

These tasted great, the ones that didn't wind up sacrificed to the Weber grill gods. As the recipe didn't specify HOW you are to grill asparagus, I went with the top reviewer's recommendation of skewering them. Well. Skewering asparagus must be an art form, because even though I had nice thick fat asparagus, they kept rupturing when I pressed them through. Regrettably, some died in the flames. The ones that survived -- beautifully blackened and smoked, grilled asparagus is not to be missed! Good luck getting the little monsters safely back off the grill, everyone :=) Thanks for sharing, this recipe caused my husband to suggest we buy a "vegetable cage for the grill", this apparently being something they make just for this purpose :o)

Fabulous! I threw the asparagus in a ziploc bag with kosher salt, balsamic vinegar, EVOO and garlic powder. Cooked on 425 degrees for 8 mins, flipped and cooked another 8 mins. Spritzed with a dash of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the dish and served. DEEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!

Excellent.  Used garlic salt and a really good olive oil and let marinate for an hour or so while I was preparing the rest of the meal.  Took about ten minutes to grill to beautiful tenderness.  Everyone - even the kids - loved it.  Sliced the leftovers and mixed with rotini pasta, a diced tomato, olive oil, garlic and some fresh basil - wonderful.  Enjoyed this great summertime recipe!  Thanks for posting!

I have been making my asparagus this way for a while.  I love to use Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  The Kosher salt gives it a salty crunch.  When I can't use the grill, roast it in the oven at 400 degrees until the tips are toasty and brown.  YUMMY!

Great! Rinsed asparagus, cut off about an inch of the stems, drizzled with some olive oil - rolling to coat, seasoned, & threw in the oven. How easy is that! Cooked in the oven at 425 for 12-15 minutes, shaking the pan half way through. We still plan to make it on the grill someday. Asparagus is one of those veggies that people avoid because of not knowning how to cook it, or the yucky/mussy memories of having it as a kid. I think what people like about this recipe is that it's a good easy way to make tasty asparagus. Thanks!

After reading a few reviews, I combined a few and tweaked it to suit my tastes....I brushed the asparagus in EVO, sprinkled with sea salt, freshly ground pepper and minced garlic.  I marinated it for about an hour.  Then grilled for about 8 minutes, using my veggie grilling tray to keep the asparagus from falling through the grates.  Then, I sprinkled with a little fresh lemon juice.  It was FANTASTIC!  My husband and I both agreed we could make a meal out of the asparagus alone.  I will never  make asparagus any other way!

All the people who are marinating are missing out.  My family, from the youngest to the oldest, all ADORE this basic, perfect ingredient list. Keep it simple. Don't waste all that great flavor. If you want to mix it up, try sprinkling with fresh chopped rosemary for even more flavor. No need to get more complicated than that.

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  I use my George Foreman grill and the asparagus comes out so fresh and flavorful.  I recommend everyone try it at least once and I think it will become your new favorite way to cook asparagus!

This is ridiculously simple to make.  I wrapped my asparagus in foil, let it sit on the grill for 20 min., and it turned out perfectly.  Only thing that I did differently was add sea salt to the spears before grilling.

Another reviewer suggested using Montreal Steak Seasoning and I'm glad I did! Coated the asparagus with Olive Oil and sprinkled the Montreal Steak Seasoning and OMG it was SUPER YUMMY and SO SIMPLE! I have no idea why I never thought of grilling it before!

Awesome! I marinated it in EVOO, balsamic vinaigrette, kosher salt & ground pepper about an hour. Grilled it on my Cuisinart Griddler until just tender, crisp. Easy, fast and delish!

My family loves this recipe. I use my George Forman grill to grill this, it works wonderful. I also found that if you use garlic salt instead of regular salt it gives it an extra kick! Great recipe!

I've done this for years, but I put olive oil, garlic and whatever other seasonings you would like, in a zip loc bag.  Add asparagus and marinate for 15 minutes or more.  You then either cook on the grill, or in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  When done, sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese for extra flavor.

Delicious!!  My 15 year old called this "brilliant".  (My 8 year old had to be bribed to eat 3 small pieces.....)  I did the bamboo skewer thing, and added a quick sprinkle of granulated garlic along with the kosher salt, pepper and olive oil.  Fresh garlic would've been even better.  Gave it right around 5 minutes, and think possibly another 30 to 45 seconds would've been perfect.  Still.... YUM!!

These went on a cookie sheet sprayed with olive oil. I sprayed the asparagus with the olive oil too, then sprinkled with salt and pepper and baked for 475 oven for 8-10 minutes. My son said these were the best asparagus he'd ever had. These were gone in 5 minutes! YUMMY to say the least!

try adding Montreal steak Seasoning with the olive oil! I hated asparagus until I was served this at a cookout. Now, it's a staple for summer! Don't be afraid to let it char a little!

Tender and delicious. Simple to prepare, and the grilling was done in 5-6 minutes. This dish has become one of my very favorites. For ease of coating, grab a ziplock bag, pour in the olive oil with salt & pepper, then add the asparagus. Let sit for a few minutes to absorb, and use your fingers (or tongs) to quickly set on the grill.

this was so awesome! I squeezed a lime over them in addition to the other ingredients, and you could really taste it - so zippy and fresh! next time i'll try a lemon. i had very thin asparaguses (asparagi?) and so 2 - 3 minutes was perfect cooking time. Perhaps if you have thicker asparagus, you will need longer cooking time. Went very well with the Grilled Salmon with Ginger-Orange Glaze recipe on this site.

Made this the other night for friends, added the asparagus to the grill after the chicken was done.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I was most surprised when my 3 year old went back for seconds and thirds!  Definitely a keeper!

Like many other reviewers, I also marinated the asparagus in EVOO, balsamic vinegar, fresh ground pepper, minced garlic, and a dash of salt - but only for about an hour.  Threw it on the grill until tender (but not limp) and then finished it off with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Perfecto!

I had never grilled asparagus before but they were yummy. The grill adds a special flavor to them thats irresistable. Along with salt and pepper I added a little garlic power.

Excellent flavor.  We did trim to remove the tough ends.  We put them in a plastic baggie and sprinkle with olive oil and mixed, then sprinkle with sea salt and pepper and mixed again.  There was some grill-side discussion as to whether we should have parboiled before grilling, with some declaring they would be tough with just 3 minutes of cooking.  This recipe prevailed, thank goodness, and we all enjoyed them tremendously - even fighting over the last ones.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really very good. I did half according to the recipe and added a little balsamic to the other half according to some of the reviews and I think the batch with the balsamic was better. Thanks for the recipe!

I let them sit in a bag with the balsamic vinegar and EVOO (with a little salt and pepper) for about an hour and grilled them on the Weber charcoal grill.  Watch them closely, they need to come off as soon as they are flexible (and slightly charred).   They were great and my wife really liked them.  She can be hard to please.  This is a good alternative to steaming them in  the microwave.  Five stars for simplicity and great taste.

I took the advice of others and marinated the asparagus in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, a bit of kosher salt and some pepper for a half an hour.  I then baked these at 475 for about 10-15 minutes.  They were very good and next time, I'll try them on the grill.

I don't what I could have done wrong since this really isn't a recipe in my opinion, but this may be the most bland dish I've ever eaten.

Let me start by saying that I do not like asparagus. I tolerate only because the rest of my family does like it, and it has a (mercifully) short season. That being said, THIS WAS AMAZING! We used baby asparagus, marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar for an hour or 2. (1 pound asparagus, a couple of Tbsps of olive oil, and a Tbsp of balsamic vinegar. I also threw in a bit of chopped garlic). Hubby did them on an Green Egg type (Komado)grill for around 3 minutes on high heat. He kept eating "samples" until he thought they were perfect. Fast, easy, healthy, and even good for a non asparagus person :)

This is the best asparagus you can possibly eat! We've also added some dry Lipton Onion Soup to the bag with the olive oil - omitting the salt - and it's awesome!

Quick and easy.  For years I thought a really hated this veggie after being served mushy concoctions when I was young.  I think I've only bought it once as an adult because of the trauma.  My husband brings it home and I still cringe a bit, but this was tasty and the asparagus was nice a firm.

This has been a family favorite for years. I combine olive oil, kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper and minced garlic with asparagus in a ziploc bag to coat. Even finicky neighbor kids will enjoy asparagus prepared this way.

We loved this. The asparagus has a nice crunch to it. We added a little bit of fresh crused garlic for some added flavor and it was great. Awesome side/compliment to our steaks!

This is unbelievable!  We just drizzled it with some extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with quite a bit of salt and pepper.  We threw it on the grill for about 5 minutes or so...it was PERFECT!  I will be making this all summer long!

Excellent! It is so simple that I thought it wouldn't be right. I have had a hard time getting asparagus right in the past. The key is the cooking time. This recipe said to grill for 3 minutes. I grilled for 5 minutes and it was perfect. I would say 3-5 minutes max grill time or you'll ruin it. (Note: I also sprinkled garlic powder on it before grilling along with what the recipe called for.)

This has always been a great simple way to grill it. We add a splash or 2 of Basamlc vinegar prior to grilling. When its finished grilling we sqeeze with lime and top with crubled feta. Huuuuum!!!

Just delicious! I did add some crushed garlic, lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice. I let it marinate for an hour before grilling...it was devoured!

We add garlic to the oil and make this all the time - it's a big hit.

I made this exactly how the recipe called for! Very simple and delicious! Just be careful when grilling so the asparagus doesn't fall through the grill.

Excellent!  Made this with the Smothered Steak which was also excellent.  Added garlic to the marinade and actually marinaded the asparagus for a few hours before preparing.  Very good!  Who knew??

I have been wanting to review this for some time now. Honestly, I don't understand why everyone likes this...it is absolutely NASTY. Even my wife agreed and YES I followed it to the letter. It tasted like...asparagus!!That's about it! No flavor whatsoever. 

I joined this site just to review this one recipe because I still can't believe how bad it was with so many good reviews. Strange!

This was so easy!  Thank you for sharing.  Mine cooked quicker than I thought, so they were on the "blackened" side, but I will try it again definitely.  Despite the "blackened" they were still very good.  Next time I might turn the heat down just a little, or put them on the rack above the direct heat.

Oh my gosh!  3 of us (one a picky teenager) ate an entire pound of this!  I used garlic salt and sprinkled it on as soon as I put the stalks on the grill.  Only bad thing is no leftovers for work tomorrow!

This recipe is terrific - I have been making grilled asparagus for years.  For a flavor variation, add garlic powder (to taste) with the salt and pepper.

Yummy and light, but difficult to keep from rolling in between the grates on the grill (yes, the asparagus was perpendicular to the grating).

Nice to have the simple, fresh recipes to offset the saucy, heavier fare.

you can either eat this hot or cold. If hot try it by sparkling grinded parmesan on. If cold after putting on the platter add olive oil on it and keep refrigerated for about two hours before eating. Both are excellent.

This is a fool-proof basic recipe...I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder, dried herbs, and some chopped garlic. I was cooking some chicken at 375 degrees so I stuck these in at the same temperature and they were done in about 15 mins. Perfect!

This was a great way to make asparagus. The tricky part is cooking it just right. I tossed the asparagus spears in the olive oil with some pepper, salt, and garlic powder, and cooked over the stove top for about 15 minutes. Next time I'll add more garlic and maybe add some lemon juice on top. Great recipe!

This is absolutely delicious!  We roll the asparagus in the olive oil and use different types of grilling seasonings. We let them rest in the fridge for about 2-3 hours to marinade.

Best asparagus ever!!! Used a blush vinegar and added a little sprinkle of ground ginger. Marinated for about 10 minutes before putting them on the grill on medium heat.

Followed advice from reviewer SHUGGLES:
After reading a LOT of other member comments, I decided to marinate in EV olive oil, coarsley-ground pepper, kosher salt (only a bit of salt), minced garlic and a bit of balsamic vinegar, for about 2 hours. Threaded on to bamboo skewers and grilled on the barbecue at a medium heat setting for a total of about 5-6 minutes. Absolutely to DIE for! THE BEST asparagus I've ever eaten. My guest raved about them long after the meal was over.

Yum.  I drizzled a little balsamic vinegar over the finished product and then sprinkled a little feta cheese over it.

This is an amazing way to eat this very flavorful and wonderful veggie!! Do not cook it too long, 10 minutes is too long, you will lose the nutrients! 2-3 mins, still crisp-crunch and oh so delish!!

No need to modify this or make it any more difficult, it is truly delicious EXACTLY as written.  Part of the greatness of this recipe is its ease and simplicity. Make it according to the recipe the first time, then you can make it more complicated (with marinating, skewers, garlic, balsalmic, etc) as you please.  BTW, this recipe also works extremely well for zucchini sliced length-wise.

Good but I prefer to coat the asparagus with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and kosher salt to taste then place in the oven at 450 for a few minutes, time depends on thickness of asparagus.  As a matter of fact, you can cook a lot of vegetables that way, delicious.

Easy and delicious. Lets the true flavour of the asparagus shine through. Served with lemon wedges on the side for those who like lemony asparagus, but it was good either way. I think thicker asparagus works better here than the really thin stalks. Thanks!

I've made this for many years. Guests just stand at the grill to get them when done. They usually don't get a chance to make it to a plate! I use kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper placed in a ziplock bag along with a very good quality olive oil. Let rest for an hour before grilling. EXCELLENT!!

So simple but soooo good. We have an indoor/outdoor Foreman grill and they took about 15 minutes on high to get to the way I like them. I started out breaking them at the natural breaking point, then putting in layers and drizzling with olive oil, garlic salt, and cracked black pepper. They made 2 layers. I tossed them around before putting on the grill. Then when I pulled them off I topped with fresh parmesan. VERY good!!! Thanks!

I placed the asparagus in a zip lock baggie with olive oil, fresh lemon juice, original mrs dash, salt, and pepper. Let marinate for about 8 hours. Grilled with onion slices (and all marinate spices) wrapped in foil. WOW! This was the best asparagus I've ever eaten. Thanks for the grilling idea! I always have to spruce things up...

I grill asparagus just about every night, but I also use celery salt with my s&p.  I also use minced garlic from the jar to spread over the spears (before putting on the grill) and some of the liquid from the jar.  It adds a nice flavor that is not overly garlicy.

I used anothers person's tip and put the asparagus in a ziplock bag with a little olive oil and seasoned pepper, squished it all around to coat the asparagus let it sit in the fridge for a few hours then grilled it on the grill with key west chicken...the pieces that were "burnt" were the best what an easy way to serve this yummy veggie

This is simple and great.  I added some minced garlic, and cooked for about 3 min. each side for a total of about 6 min.  My girlfriend beat me to the last of the seconds.

Not very creative.  I don't know if this qualifies as a "recipe" - very simple and dull.

Since I tried this, I make my asparagus like this all the time and everyone loves it!  I can't understand the bland reviews.  All I can figure, is they don't like asparagus.  This is so much better than steamed!  Maybe it  has something to do with the oil.  I roll mine around in extra virgin olive oil with salt and pepper.  The flavor from the grill really adds something.  Be sure not to overcook!

The recipe without modifications is definitely worth only three stars.  It is VERY bland.  But, if you add a clove of fresh, crushed garlic, salt, and freshly ground pepper, it is worth five stars.  Light, tasty, and satisfying.  Enjoy!

I've been grilling asparagus for the last few springs.  Unless the spears are pencil thin, they need to be grilled longer.  I grill mine with sesame oil drizzled over them and sprinkled with pink sea salt.  Lots of flavor and so yummy.  This also works well with skewered veggies like: bell peppers, onion and mushroom. Make a lot, my guests eat ALL that I make!

I just don't get all the great reviews!  This was totally bland.  I ended up melting butter in a skillet, sautéing garlic, and adding garlic pepper and tossed the asparagus in it.  Then it was good.

I may never eat steamed asparagus again!!  I made this last night with grilled zucchini, yellow squash (sliced), grilled green peppers, and a mountain of grilled shrimp.
It was the first warm day of the season, sure tasted like summer!!  I was eating the asparagus off the grill while I waited for the shrimp!

I made asparagus for the first time using this recipe.  I really enjoyed it (this was the first time as an adult eating it).  My kids ate it with only a little bit of complaining (with 5 kids that is pretty much a miracle!) Will make again.

Was actually prety good.  One or two minutes on the grill however did not work and the veggies were a bit too raw.  I will cook a few more minutes next time...otherwise this was just fine.

This was really good. I bundled the asparagus in 4 or 5 pieces and wrapped them with bacon after breaking off the hard end. They were great grillers...

This simple recipe is proof that good food does not always need to be complicated nor require exotic ingredients.  This is a great recipe requiring no more than five to ten minutes of your time.  It tastes fabulous.

A friend made this at our place for an Easter brunch - it was fabulous!  I'd reduce the butter and oil a bit, but the flavor was incredible - best asparagus I've had.

This was sooo good!  Having only recently added asparagus to my list of food likes, this really made me a believer.  I used the spray-on roasted garlic oil with the salt and pepper.  Everyone thought I had made a special marinade.  They loved it!

This is my favorite way to eat asparagus. Don't cover up that delicious flavor with any sauces or seasonings. Just a simple prep, grill (I use a grill pan), eat. Done.

I'm not a big fan of asparagus, but my husband is. I made this for him and he loved it. It was quick and easy. I did give it a taste since I made my kids taste it, it was better than other asparagus I've had. This is one I'll make again.

We had this as part of our Easter dinner tonight, and the whole family loved it! We loved how easy it was to make, and how fast it was too. Grilling the asparagus gives it a nice, smoky flavor. I wasn't sure if I would like asparagus, but after my first bite, I was hooked. This is definitely a recipe we plan to make over and over again!

Best way to have asparagus!  Throw in a little minced garlic, kosher salt and garlic pepper with the olive oil and let it marinade for a half hour.  Keep an eye on it on the grill.  Get's rave reviews every time I make it.

I mixed garlic powder, sea salt & pepper into some EVOO, poured it over the asparagus and let it sit an hour or so until it was time to grill. I couldn't find my skewers (recently moved, still unpacking) so I wrapped the asparagus loosely in aluminum foil and grilled for about 5 minutes until the grilled filet mignon and lobster tails (grilled also) were done. I didn't bother turning the foil packet and the result was fabulous. Even one of my guests who typically doesn't care for asparagus enjoyed it.

Next time we need to cook them a little bit longer for the tenderness that I like. So 6-8 min each side. Still wonderful!

This is how I make mine but I also wrap them in foil and that way I can add thinly sliced garlic. And I also use lemon pepper instead of regular pepper.

I've been grilling asparagus for years because it is so awesome!  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and I sprinkle parmesan on the asparagus after taking off the grill.

Yummy!!! So simple and yet oh so tasty! My bf grilled the asparagus and I steamed some...  we ate his before the rest of dinner was even finished cooking! Yes, it's simple, but the grill gives it some flavor and crisp!

I had a teen who did not like asparagus, but when I made this on the BBQ he now loves it. This is our favorite way to eat this veggie in our home. Although, I just toss them in a bowl with some olive oil, sea salt, pepper, garlic and sprinkle with Parmesan. Cook til warm on the grill, indoor or out!

Had company last night and it was raining hard, so i roasted them instead of grilling.  Read reviews, and because I wanted to prep these along with other things I was making, I took the advice to marinate them til I was ready (about 3 hours), and added balsamic vinegar and garlic salt instead of regular - they were great and at 400 f they only took about 15 mins - the same time as my main halibut wellington.

My family all hated asparagus. That is until we tried it grilled like this. Now it is one of our favorite vegetables. I tell everybody, if you think you don't like asparagus try it this way. If you think you like asparagus try it this way and you will LOVE asparagus.

A throw-away foil grill sheet works great in lieu of skewers.  They are great for grilling veggies and available where grill supplies are sold.  Excellent recipe!

If you don't like asparagus, you MUST try this recipe! Delicious! I followed some other reviews suggestions and marinated the asparagus in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt & pepper for an hour before threading them onto skewers. Cooked them on the grill for 3 minutes per side.
They turned out absolutely delicious with a really nice smoky flavor. They were still a bit crunchy, which was great because they never had a chance to turn stringy (which is what I usually hate about asparagus.

I followed the recipe to a “T”, didn’t make no changes.  This was the very first time I had ever eaten and/or cooked asparagus, and it was delicious!!!   I made this tonight with rice and fried pork chops.   Next time, just to try them a different way,  I will marinate them in Italian dressing and use garlic power as suggested by other reviewers.   I will be buying more asparagus because of this recipe.   I found a new vegetable!!!   Thanks for sharing!!!!

Perfect. Found some asparagus on sale and so I thought I'd try it on the kids. Hubby hates it so I don't ever make it. Used this recipe and the kids loved it! I had to make sure I got a few spears for myself, they just devoured it :) Served with lemon wedges so you add a squirt of juice. Thanks!

Nothing special. I would have added some garlic or something. And I cooked it for about 3 minutes and it was crunchy but didn't seem cooked enough.

The grilled asparagus was great, my husband loved them.  I did like one other review I soak wooden skewers and then I put 6-7 asparagus on the skewer.  This works out perfect.  Will fix them again...

This recipe is perfect! Just for ease, I use spray oil in a can instead of pouring olive oil. I thought you couldn't surpass pan cooked asparagus, but using a grill accomplished that. So yummy, and fast! This has already become a regular in our house. Makes a great side dish to a burger.

Absolutely delicious! Used another viewers suggestion. Put olive oil and seasonings in a ziploc bag to season asparagus and added lemon pepper and garlic powder.

Love asparagus and grilling/ roasting it takes it to a new level. After coating asparagus with EVOO I add salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and Mrs. Dash Original blend.... If you have a Kroger in your area, the kroger brand original seasoning is even better!

Yes, the simpler the better, and I agree with adding balsamic vinegar, and using kosher salt is the best. I've also tried it with sea salt which was good. But my best recommendation is to place the spears on a cedar plank; then you don't have to worry about the spears falling through the grill, and the cedar infuses a nice flavor! Great with grilled salmon!

My kids have NEVER liked asparagus. They moaned and complained when I served it like this last night. I told them they both had to try 1 stalk, and that was it. They took one bite and then each grabbed 4 or 5 more stalks! They naturally like veggies anyways but this was a big hit with them! I read some of the reviews and did marinate in the olive oil for 20 min before putting it on the grill. I also used garlic salt as opposed to regular salt. Next time I think I'm gonna try the lemon pepper suggestion and see how that works out. Thanks for the great ideas!

Some of the reviewers are over-complicating this recipe.  The beauty of the recipe is the simplicity and speed.  If you want fast, delicious asparagus cook this as written.  You will not be disappointed.

This is good, but next time try adding some granulated garlic and dry minced onion and marinate 30 mins before grilling. It will go to a 5 star recipe!

I don't think I could have asked for a more simple or better-tasting way to make asparagus. I used extra virgin olive oil because I had learned to use that from a cooking channel, and everything was fantastic! Literally only takes 3 minutes!

Yum! I tried to spear my spears with kabob sticks, but gave up pretty quick. Unless you have thick spears (which I was always taught the thin spears are what you want), this is a pain. Just put the spears perpendicular to the grill grate. Anyway, we cooked on the top grill rack for slightly longer than noted. I've tried soaking in balsamic vin and oil before, and we prefer this cooking method without it, just like the recipe states.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I blanched the asparagus to keep its color and then  I mixed the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper together before I brushed it on the asparagus.    Rather than mess with the grill, I put in the basket of my RONCO rotisserie for 7 minutes.  It came out PERFECT!  Thank you Larry for this recipe!

We love this and I've made it several times. However, I microwave steam mine for just a few minutes before adding it to the grill- I have little kids who like it on the soft side. The flavor of this is awesome- definatly a keeper!

I learned how to do this a while ago & both & my 23 yr old son won't deat them any other way now.  I fix them the way an earlier reviewer stated....I use lemon pepper along with the salt & pepper.  Another trick that works great so you don't waste any....instead of snapping the ends off, use a sharp knife & peel the outer stalk (sort of like peeling a carrot)from the bottom end up to about 1 1/2 to 2 inches.  The part underneath is just as tender as the rest of the stalk.

Wonderful and quick way to make Asparagus.  Here is how I did this.  I added the Olive oil (EVOO), salt, freshly ground pepper and a little bit of K.C. Masterpiece Ginger Teriyaki marinade and the Asparagus in a zipploc bag.  Transferred it to a piece of heavy duty foil and folded it so that it would not leak.  I folded another piece of foil to the other side just for extra precaution.  I grilled it for about 3-4 minutes on the top wrack of my outdoor grill.

Great recipe - and so easy! I cut of the bottom inch from the asparagus and then peeled the lower half with a vegetable pealer. I sprayed them with PAM and sprinkled it with McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning! I grilled them along side Honey-Mustard Chicken from this website!

This is our favorite way to eat asparagus.  Even my 5 yr old likes it!  We leave off the salt & pepper and then add a bit of seasoned salt to taste.  Yum!

DELICIOUS!  Oil, kosher salt, pepper and the balsamic vinegar that others recommended! I set in a ziplock and let marinade for about 2-3 hours...on the grill for about 5-6 minutes! GREAT! This and the Byrdhouse Marinated TOmatoes and Mushrooms recipe from this site, made veggies for dinner tonight SO FUN! Thank you!

I followed the advice of some other reviewer and added some additional flavors (balsamic vinegar, garlic).  I think I will add more salt next time, becuase the 1/2 tsp I added was not quite enough.  This tastes so good though, my hubby and I both agree that asparagus loves the smokey flavor of being grilled.  But note it takes about 6-8 minutes, and not the 3-4 mentioned.

We LOVE asparagus, this wasn't my favorite recipe, I really wanted to try grilling and it just wasn't as good as cooking it inside. It was dry & stringy (which may have been the asparagus itself) but the smokey grill flavor just didn't mix with the asparagus in my opinion.

I love asparagus, but it's 10 times better on the grill. While I'm sure it's great as written. I took the advice of another reviewer and used lemon pepper instead of just pepper...wow. It was amazing.

This is yummy and easy!  I did the 3 minutes on the grill and then wrapped in foil and left it on the top shelf while the meat finished cooking. 
Lawry's garlic salt is yummy on the dish too.

Delicious and flavorful.  I seasoned the asparagus with garlic salt and pepper, and my husband grilled them on the gas grill with hickory chips.  Thanks for the recipe Larry!

Easy, Easy, Easy, and very delicious.  The grill provides all the flavor you need. We didn't want to make a mess on the grill so we used aluminum foil and still had wonderful results.

Simple-Great! Great on the grill or bake it in a hot 400 degree oven. I prefer my asparagus made this way instead of cooking as it stays more tender crisp and flavorful.

Fast and easy!  The simpleness of this recipe really compliments heavier dishes.  It is so delicious . . . and nice to just enjoy the taste of the asparagus.  The flavor just shines through.  We loved it just as is!

Easy and delicious. I like to give the spears squirt of fresh lemon juices as they come off the grill. Get plenty of asparagus, a few always get sacrificed to the fire gods as they slip through the grill rack.

Two words- garlic salt.  Then it's a five.  And butter instead of olive oil.  More flavor.  No mayo needed.

We LOVE asparagus, but we've never grilled it so this was a treat.  I attached stalks together with a toothpick so they'd be easier to turn, and we put down a layer of aluminum foil so they'd cook nicely but not burn.  The asparagus stayed nice and crispy, just like we like it.  A very quick, delicious side dish, especially if you're already grilling the main dish.

This is a good way to serve asparagus if you're tired of steaming.  However, it's pretty bland.  I also had the heat up too high and charred it beyond recognition.  Next time I'd put some lemon pepper seasoning on it or something to jazz it up a little.

This needed more than salt and pepper. I used some granulated garlic and oregano.

This was an easy and effective recipe. I used foil to help control the cooking and seasoned flavor yet it ended up taking 2x as long. 
Regulating the timing of your protein and veggies when cooking on the grill, can be the toughest part. 
Practice will help. Enjoy your food!

I'm giving it four stars because it's took more like 13 minutes for our grill to make them on high heat. Saying this, They were delicious!!

I have been grilling asparagus for years.  Try adding a little more seasonings like onion powder, garlic powder, Natures Seasoning & lemon pepper. You won't regret it!  I always keep a container of above on hand labeled grilled veges seasoning.

First, grilling asparagus tastes so much better than any other method. I use olive oil, lemon, and garlic salt and that is a awesome combo. Lemon just gives it that extra zing. I place the asparagus on tinfoil on the grill at about 300 degree for 5-10 mins per side...comes out great. Adding a little Parmesan cheese just before done is also tasty.

Great way to cook asparagus-5 stars, however this is very bland. If you read the reviews most of the 5 stars raters made changes. Adding a balsamic glaze when it comes off the grill is my recommended change. Thanks Larry for sharing.

Not bad. So simple and so good. Will definitely try again. Cooked on the grille but with Winter coming up I will probably try it in the oven during the Winter months (that is if I am  so lucky to find fresh asparagus in New England during the Winter months)

Can't go wrong w/grilled asparagus!  Season to your own personal preference, but EVOO and salt works just fine, too.  Mr. LTH grilled these for about 5 minutes alongside some tuna after the first flip and they were perfectly al dente.

Prepared exactly as stated with the exception of grilling over medium high heat instead of high heat.  I have burnt vegetables grilling over high heat, so, I thought I better play it safe.  They cooked perfectly, had great flavor,  and still retained a nice crisp bite which we liked. Grilled with our pork chops and saved us from heating up the kitchen!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added balsamic vinegar - the flavor of asparagus with balsamic was not my favorite combo.  I'll try the recipe next time as-is, hopefully with better results.

I didn't use olive oil, but used a canola oil spray, to reduce calories...and oil intake. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic power, and onion powder then grilled for about 10 minutes....they are sooooo good!!!
...and healthier without all the oil.

Your seasonings are just right!  As my wife will not eat asparagas, I make this for myself.  When I am not grilling, I place a single serving in a non stick jellyroll pan and roast it in the oven at 400 degrees for 8 to 10 mnutes. It is amazing what olive oil, salt and pepper will do!!

Was a little bland for my tastes.  I suggest marinating in a half cup of Italian dressing sprinkled with some black pepper and garlic salt for about 30 minutes prior to grilling.  Grill on high heat until tips are starting to char.  Also paring the skin off the stalks enables you to enjoy the entire spear without the stringiness of the skin.

These were very good, this was the first time I made asparagus. I made them as directed but I found that you have to eat them quick because they dont taste as good cold. But right off the grill they are really good.

Nice! My fiance and I entertained last night. We were already grilling shrimp and I had some fresh asparagus in the fridge that needed using up, so I did a search on here for grilled asparagus and this recipe came up. While this is not my favorite way to prepare / eat asparagus, it was pretty good nonetheless. I did change things up a bit, however. I too marinated my asparagus in EVOO, a splash of balsamic vinegar and a generous dose of sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper. My fiance grilled these a little too long for my tastes (ours were slightlly mushy), but everyone still enjoyed them. :) Thanks for sharing your simple idea, Larry!

Quick, easy and good - although I think I would have liked a little balsamic vinegar in there somewhere, and maybe some garlic.  Next time I'll drizzle a bit on when serving!

This is the tried, true, and healthy way to get your veggies!  Personally, I like mine a little charred/crispy, so I make sure the grill is nice and hot and keep the asparagus on just a little bit longer than the recipe states.  Also, be generous with the pepper and use seasoning salt for a really nice touch.  Finally, for those of you vinegar fans, a spritz of balsamic before serving tastes fantastic.

Very very tasty on the grill!  Friends served this a few weekends back so we tried it ourselves this weekend and the only change was that I sprinkled lemon pepper on them right before serving.  Delishious.

I'm not sure why but I've only eaten asparagus once before in a risotto.  With the abundance of fresh asparagus available right now and the fact I'm trying to eat more veggies I figured it was time to give it a try.  This looked like the best way to let the true flavor of the veggie come through and boy did it!  I loved it!  Awesome, simple, fresh!!

This simple recipe is easy to make and accentuates nicely the taste of the asparagus. It's best not to overcook, as the asparagus will become limp. This goes very nicely with any grilled meat and can be made right after you pull the meat off the grill.

Don't be afraid to grill to the point of almost-burnt.  I love asparagus prepared this way, with little bits that are charred.  I use lots of salt and pepper - it's like candy to me!

Great recipe and great follow up tips. I like to first cut the white ends off, about an inch. then put in a zip lock bag with lots of olive oil and pepper with a few splashes of basalmic vinegar. Place on a mesh vegetable tray on the grill with the tips on low heat and the ends on medium high heat. This cooks them evenly. Jostle them occasionally.  After ten minutes they are ready. Put them on a plate and cover them with shredded parmesan cheese. Place in the microwave for 45 seconds and serve. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

So simple and sooooo delicious!  It's wonderful just like it's listed.  And as many others have suggested, it's also super good if you tweak the flavor a bit with an olive oil and balsamic vinegar marinade.  I wouldn't salt until ready to grill because I think it toughens the asparagus just a bit if put in the marinade.   I HIGHLY recommend using a grill basket if you're "tong challenged" like me.

Probably the best asparagus I've ever had. I marinated a lb of asparagus in a plastic bag with about 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 2 Tblsp minced garlic. I grilled in a wok/grilling basked on the top rack for about 5-6 minutes. My fiance hates asparagus, but I think he ate more than me! He loved it!

This is the first time I've eaten fresh asparagus. I've tried canned once, and I hated it. This recipe was absolutely delicious! I followed the recommendation of doing the EVOO, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper marinade. I marinated for 2 hours. I grilled it in a grill basket for about 5 minutes. My family ate it all!

Great easy recipe.  I used seasoned bread dipping oil instead of plain olive oil and it gave the asparagus a great additional flavors and no need for salt.

Loved it!  I'm trying to get my son to eat more veggies.  The only change I made was a splash of lemon juice and fresh parmesan cheese.  Oh and some garlic powder.  My son was very hesitant to taste it.  I literally had to beg him.  And as soon as he tasted it, he loved it!  It will now become a regular on our menu.  Thanks!

This is the all-around perfect, basic asparagus recipe.  Very simple and everything to taste.  But considering how simple and somewhat obvious it sounds, it really does make wonderful, perfectly "tender-crisp" asparagus. Simple is definitely better and we'll be doing these again!

Excellent!  Next time I'm going to use thicker asparagus.  Don't use the thin stuff, it'll get mushy and burnt in a heartbeat.

we LOVE asparagus but was not a big hit. I had a single layer on the BBQ but some seemed to cook and some did not. And the BBQ flavor just id dnot seem to be very good. Will stick with steaming.

Great recipe, even when prepared in the oven.  I added several cloves of garlic and was glad to have added in the extra bit of flavor.  My 6 year old daughter couldn't get enough!

Fabulous!  I made a little foil tray to place beneath the asparagus.  They didn't get the grill marks, but there was quite a bit of browning.  I was cooking pork chops at medium heat, so I cooked these for about 12 minutes on the medium heat.  I also added some roughly chopped garlic to the mixture before cooking.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe--didn't have lots of flavor, even though I added minced garlic and onion powder.  I've only tried asparagus a few times, though, and am not sure I like it anyway.  My bf thought they were good, just not cooked long enough (I didn't grill and did it on the stovetop--probably should have used a larger skillet).

I have prepared asparagus many different ways, but grilling is definitely my favorite. I add a bit of thyme along with the salt and pepper, which makes it very tasty.

This was WONDERFUL!!!!!! I also splashed just a touch of balsamic vinegar on them just before grilling. I served with hollandaise sauce and the soy and ginger ribeye recipe on this site with a side of garlic smashed potatoes. There were no leftovers. I never even like asparagus before this. Probably b/c I had only had the canned variety. Great way to introduce kids to asparagus too!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM!!!!!!!!!

I make a version of this recipe but I marinate for about 30 minutes and use fresh cracked pepper and salt and also balsamic vinegar.  Always use good quality olive oil.  Very good!

I got such a kick out of the range of reviews for this recipe. I made this tonight for my husband and 3 year old. We regularly eat steamed or canned asparagus. I thought it was out of this world and naively thought they would too. My husband gives it a one star and son wouldn't even try it. I will not eat it any other way. Absolutely delicious!

This is so easy, even my food preparation-challenged husband can do it. Plus, he normally doesn't even like asparagus and he LOVES it cooked this way.

Pick up a deli roasted chicken, a bottle of riesling, and a bundle of asparagus- you've got a great meal in 5 min!

This was my first try at cooking asparagus and my family really enjoyed it! I broiled them instead of grilling, and I added a bit of Kosher salt with cracked pepper. The taste is much better when you use those versus table salt and pepper.

So simple. Very easy to prepare with a great taste. I let the asparagus grill for a few extra minutes. Next time, I may add a sprinkling of grated or shredded parmesan cheese.

This is the easiest way I have found for cooking asparagus.  My mom, who usually boiled hers, agreed when I took a batch of asparagus over one holiday weekend and grilled them up for her.  She loved the fact that they weren't stringy like when she boiled them, but rather crunchy and more flavorful.

Delicious! After a friend introduced us to grilled asparagus, I came on here to find a recipe to follow to prepare it at home. This is almost identical to what he told us. The only addition we used was garlic salt and we let them marinate for a couple hours. All 4 of us devoured them. This will be a new side in our rotation for sure!

Grilled asparagus is so delicious! We always buy steak when asparagus is cheap in the spring and season it to go with whatever steaks we are preparing. lemon pepper, balsamic, Montreal, and parmesan all taste great on charred 'gus'. Must have high heat if using infrared grill otherwise it's limp and has no crunch.

I have made this several times but I use nature's season and garlic power and it's the best. The garlic power brings put a fantastic flavor.  Love it.  I have also used zucchini and it's just as good.

I made this for our first grill meal and it was by far the best asparagus ever! It was done before the other grill items so I did the foil to keep warm, this made it. It sat in the olive oil and salt & pepper. Out of this world. I did do one thing different, I used the Himalayan salt block to prepare and it gave an amazing flavor. I also believe in organic asparagus.

SUPER Recipe
Super delicious, super easy and super nutritious !
This was the first time I’ve tried grilling asparagus. It couldn’t have been easier or tastier as is. It’s also a  basic recipe that is easy to change up a bit, depending on your taste buds the day you make. Feel like some heat (and lots of people do), sprinkle on some red  or cayenne pepper. Want a little Italian flavor? Garlic powder and/or some oregano will be delicious. Any spice you like can be sprinkled in as lightly or heavily as you like!

Always tastes great grilled,  substitute grated or shredded  Asiago cheese for less salt to add a bit more flavor.   It's always a favorite!

I made this almost per the recipe and we loved it. We do love the natural flavors of our veggies though. I didn't  measure the salt or pepper. I just sprinkled them on. I didn't have olive oil so I used cooking spray and it worked just fine. I am definitely making this again. I had it as a side and grilled steaks and made brown rice. We loved it!

Absolutely delicious and so simple!!  Use a slotted grill pan for your grill and you won't have to worry about spears falling through the grate.  Also you won't have to mess with skewer's. Get a non-stick one!

I used garlic olive oil instead of regular olive oil to add garlic flavor - very good! You could add minced garlic to the mix and use regular olive oil instead. I let them marinade for about 30 minutes prior to grilling.

Took other reviewers advice and marinated asparagus in a zip loc with EVOO, balsamic vinegar, kosher salt and garlic powder for several hours.  Roasted in 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes.  Next time will try w/o vinegar and a little shorter time, maybe a bit less salt.  Still delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe from someone who hasn't cooked a lot of asparagus!

I've made these before, but my daughter told me to try Italian salad dressing on them and I used a foil pack. They came out great. She grilled them with the dressing directly on the grill. Either way... it's now my favorite way to make and love asparagus.

Didn't read cooking time and left on the grill for around 10 or more minutes. They came out delicious. Maybe a little well done but I don't like my asparagus crunchy  (al dente) anyway. So easy and tasted amazing!!

It was okay. The grilling time was far too short and it lacked flavor . I would up the oil to 2 tblspoons and add garlic powder and lemon for taste. I find asparagus to be something you need to grill as long as necessary until it is soft but still firm.

This was alright. It was raining the day I made it, so I had to use my oven. Broiled for 8 minutes on each side. It was okay, but I added garlic salt to it afterwards and that helped a bit. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus anyways, so I was hoping this would make it better.

Very good!  My family loved it!  The only change I made was to use lemon infused olive oil. I recommend the smiling olive mail order company online ordering for the high quality oil. I used my cast iron grill pan. I grilled it on high heat and kept turning it. Great results! I'll make it again.I used the left overs in ham, mushroom, asparagus quiche.

Use whatever seasonings that sound good (less is often more), and use thinner asparagus as they tend to be more crisp and not "woody".  We remove from the grill while still fairly crunchy (our personal preference).

This recipe was so easy.  I thought about adding asparagus at the last minute and wanted something quick with ingredients that I would have on hand.  It was delicious and will be a regular addition when grilling out.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I have a vegetable grill basket that sit's right on top of the grill. It makes it so easy to add your own seasonings' and flip over to cook the other side without losing any asparagus down in the grill.

Delicious! I used skewers as suggested in one of the reviews and cooked them on aluminum foil for the first 5-6 minutes then moved them directly to the grill for another 2-3 minutes.

I've been doing this for years, and I can say that this is a perfect "go to" side for a variety of entrees that need a veggie. Pretty much a "simply throw it on the grill" type of side dish.

This is really good with the balsamic vinegar addition. The easiest way to cook this on a grill is to put it in a fish basket.  You don't have to skewer each piece and you can turn it all over at one time. Quick and easy

Just made these.  Used roasted garlic, oil, and healthy amounts of salt and pepper.   (Okay, I used a lot of salt and pepper.)  Maybe next time cut the asparagus a little smaller and be a little more generous with the roasted garlic

My family loved them!  After grilling the asparagus we ate it with pork tenderloin, which we also grilled.  They thought that in the recipe it should say something about cutting the bottom off, it makes it taste way better.  Another thing, it didn't take as long as the recipe suggested, in fact it only took less five minutes even then a couple pieces were burnt. Great recipe, and thanks for sharing.

Made it and it tasted a little plain. For my recipe I grill mine on an oven top. You can use a grill or oven top but I heat my oven to 8 and I apply olive oil onto my asparagus . I then squeeze some lemon. NOT ALOT it will make ur asparagus taste bitter if so. Squeeze about 4-6 drops onto the asaragus and then add salt and pepper . It's amazing

I use Tony Chachere's Spice N' Herbs Seasoning on the asparagus.  Olive oil to coat it, then the seasoning.  It adds a little "kick" to the taste. Be careful thought, a little goes a long way.  His blackening seasoning is also great to use, but again, a little goes a long way.

I grilled it with olive oil and fresh lemon juice. It's delicious and helped me eat a lot of it for someone who doesn't really like asparagus...

Simple and tasty! I used thin, baby asparagus and let them char slightly for further depth of flavor. Much better than boiled asparagus!

Wonderful way to prepare asparagus.  Served along side grilled salmon and roasted baby red potatoes tonight and felt like we were eating in a 5 star restaurant! Will be using this recipe a lot when asparagus is reasonably priced so thanks for posting.

I like it with lemon and pepper seasoning. Shake all ingredients  together in a resealable plastic dish and use a grill wok or other grill dish with holes and be sure and turn with tongs about 3 or 4 times while cooking.

Best way to eat asparagus as far as I'm concerned.  I also tried marinating it in an Italian dressing and a sun-dried tomato dressing - both turned out great.  I also only used one skewer since the spears tended to split.

Can't go wrong with this recipe. Quick, simple and delicious. Using a grilling pan, put the trimmed and washed asparagus in it, sprayed with olive oil (I have one of those aerosol bottles where you put in your own oil, pump and spray), sprinkled some kosher salt and some coarse black pepper. Viola! Great side dish.

So simple, yet delicious! I put a pound of thin asparagus in tin foil, drizzled with oil, and sprinkled kosher salt on top. I grilled for 5-6 minutes. It came out fantastic! Will definitely be making this again.

I have been making them this way on the grill for years. I would never eat asparagus before. My husband always loved it. I decided to try it this way one summer day and it was a hit. Now this is the only way he wants it. Will try the balsamic some time, and the lemon pepper.

I love to grill asparagus. Although this recipe is good it is not Great! One way I enjoy is to put it in a ziploc bag and add balsamic vinegar then a generous amount of Grey Poupon mustard. Mix in the bag well till all is coated. Place on the upper rack and grill on high for 10 min. Awesome!!! I have used honey mustard salad dressing in place of the Grey Poupon as well. Very good flavors.

I cooked this just as the recipe stated, and it turned out wonderful! I used a disposable grilling basket on the top rack of the grill for about 10 minutes, then placed it on the bottom rack for about 3 minutes. Perfect!

So easy, you could do in half asleep.  We grilled the asparagus half way through grilling lobster tails (recipe also on Allrecipes) and everything came out perfectly.  Crisp to the bite, yet lightly flavorful from the olive oil and salt and pepper.

I actually made this last night before seeing this recipie! I used olive oil, salt, pepper, and some garlic powder.  I cooked them inside on my cast iron grill pan.  Very yummy! Can't wait to try it with some balsamic vinegar as some have suggested.

I wish that I had read the other comments before making this.  This was a little disappointing for us.  Not sure if my husband didn't have the heat hot enough on the grill or what, but it really wasn't cooked enough and didn't have as much flavor as I expected.  We roast asparagus in the oven this way all the time and it turns out great, but if I were to try grilling it this way again, I'd probably give it a few extra minutes and try marinating it and adding some balsamic vinergar like other reviewers suggested.

I took the advice of other reviewers and shook the aspargus in a ziploc with EVOO, pepper, garlic salt, and kosher salt.  Then I baked it at 425 for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Delicious!

Incredible !  Really good. Used my garlic infused olive oil, sprinkled on a little kosher salt (it's milder) and some fresh thyme from my garden and grilled for about 3 1/2 min (asparagus were large)...    As I might have mentioned, they were really good !

This was super easy and very good!  I coated w/EVOO and balsamic vinegar like others suggested and it was great.  It did take about 7-9 min over med-high heat though.

We grill our asparagus like this all the time, and it is EXCELLENT!! We usually use garlic salt instead of plain salt to give a little more flavor. The asparagus is great with a little char from the grill. 8~) I also like to serve it with a garlic aioli for dipping. It's not very healthy, but it sure is tasty!

I will never eat asparagus the mushy way again. Grilling is the ONLY way to go.  This is an awesome recipe with or without the basalmic vinegar as suggested by others.

I think I put too much ground pepper and left asparagus marinating in the minced garlic, olive oil for 2 days. The flavor was definitely infused into the asparagus but found it to be too strong. Also next time I should cut off the thick end of asparagus.

i didn't have a veggie basket for the grill so i substituted it for the top on my broiler pan... i added a little fresh crushed garlic, onion/garlic salt, some steak seasoning pepper grinder, and it was fantastic!!! i now have another favorite grilled veggie other than corn and bell peppers.

I love asparagus, so I found it ok, but I've finally just gotten my husband and daughter to start liking asparagus, (I usually steam it and add a little butter, lemon and salt before I serve the asparagus), they took one bite of the asparagus that some people recommended with balsamic vinigar, evoo, salt and pepper and they hated it.

This has got to be the best way to cook asparagus. This simple method brings the thunder and can't be beat. Please make grilled asparagus, just a delicious dish. You get all the green, fresh flavor of the asparagus, a little smoky char from the grill, and perfect crunch through the middle. Use this recipe!

We always grill our asparagus.  I use an olive oil pump spritzer.  It coats nicely without having to add too much oil.  Try it with a little garlic powder, so tasty.

Yummy!  I used butter instead of olive oil.  And plenty of kosher salt and pepper.  Also I put them on kebab skewers for easy turning.

Very easy and quick.  Prior to grilling, I pre-heated water in microwave then steamed the asparagus in the microwave for 5 minutes with the pre-heated water. They were delicious.

Simple, yet delicious! I've been making asparagus this way for a very long time. A great change to steamed asparagus. However, I use kosher salt. My 3-year-old daughter can never get enough!

This is so good.  My husband - the "I hate Veggies" man- loves it.  He prefers a bit of browning or charring as it makes the asgaragus so sweet.

These were really good. Even my vegetable-hating husband liked them, as did my 2-year-old. I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese over them.

I should have read reviews before making these asparagus.  Definitely needs more seasoning besides the oil, s&p.  Sorry, I love asparagus but these were bland.

This is a great way to help keep the heat out of the kitchen. The asparagus gets a bit crisp, and I found 2 - 3 minutes is a bit too short, but the flavor is great. Try adding a little lemon juice along with the olive oil and salt and pepper for a slightly different taste.

Good method for grilling asparagus.  I added a bit of lemon juice for extra flavor.  Was grilling salmon at the same time, so we grilled at low heat, and just increased the cooking time for the asparagus.

I recently decided to try some foods that I hated as a child; asparagus being one of them.  I followed the recipe as written, but did add a couple cloves of fresh crushed garlic...YUM!  I have eaten two pounds of asparagus in the past three days!  I know tastes change as you get older, but I suspect I didn't like it because of the way it was cooked in the past.  I encourage anyone who doesn't like asparagus to try this recipe, and if you like garlic I would add it too!
Thank you, Larry!

Boy, I never thought such a simple recipe could be so incredible, but it absolutely is.  I have NEVER liked asparagus until I tried this recipe.  SO SO SO good.  Last night, I brought home Wendy's salads for dinner, and my husband was sad that we didn't have any of this grilled aspargus!!

Very good and great flavor.  I took a bigger container and dumped some extra virgin olive oil into it.  I then rolled the asparagus in it, drained, and salt & peppered the asparagus to taste.  The only thing I did wrong was it got a little too well cooked on the grill and burnt a little...make sure to watch.  Thanks Larry....will be making again very soon.
