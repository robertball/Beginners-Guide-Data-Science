This turned out good and was super simple to make. I think comparing it to mac and cheese is a bit of a stretch but it was still a good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as written and it is AMAZING! It's a tiny bit on the spicy side, so adjust to taste.  To make this a complete vegan meal, I just add some black beans (I used canned, rinsed) about 5 minutes towards the end of the simmering stage. Add a side of steamed broccoli, spinach and beets and this is a great meal!

This was okay but too bland for my tastes. I even added some garam masala which helped. Thinking about adding coconut milk next time and other spices like cumin and coriander to spruce it up and give it a little more depth of flavor.
