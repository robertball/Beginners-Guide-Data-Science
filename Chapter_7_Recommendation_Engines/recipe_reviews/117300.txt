Zucchini is a vegetable I've eaten routinely all my life, particularly since it's so traditional in Italian cooking (particularly with fresh, Roma tomatoes), so I've prepared it any number of ways and it is very familiar to me. I liked the idea here, of cutting it into spears and, if left alone, it gets delicately browned and pretty. I used lemon juice rather than the zest as I wanted a more subtle flavor (zucchini is a very mild flavored vegetable) and some fresh, minced garlic, which is a must for me! Tasty and a pretty addition on the dinner plate.

I like to cut my zucchini in rounda because it cooks quicker and is easier to manage (i think). I also add a little red pepper flake for a more intense flavor.

Really enjoyed this one.  Why? It's easy, it looked good - nicely browned, and it tasted great!  I used real parmesan and sprinkled it on at the end of the cook time, so some was crispy.

These were great, I grilled them instead of frying since I was grilling anyway. I used lemon pepper since I had no fresh lemons on hand. After they cooked I sprinkled pecorino romano on them. They were delicious!

I love, love zucchini and this is one of the best preps I've found. I cooked it on a bit higher heat to get a really brown crust, but still have the crisp veggie. Freshly grated Parm adds the final little kick. Perfectly wonderful way to serve an old favorite.

This was just ok for me.  I love zucchini and that's why it was still good for me.  I added some of the lemon juice to perk it up a bit.

This is an easy vegetable dish that is good. It is a 3-4 star dish. I give it 4 because it is easy and my husband gave it 4....I'd give it 3 1/2. I would suggest being very careful not to overcook. It is easy to do since the cooking time depends on the size of the zucchini spears. Thanks, Judy, for the recipe.

We do this all the time in the summer.  Buy the smaller zucchini and cut each into 4 wedges.  A little olive oil, salt, pepper and Italian seasonings.  Voila!  Sprinkle with the cheese when done.  Also good drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar after removed from the grill.

i used freshly-squeezed lemon juice only b/c i couldn't find my zester at the last minute.  no regrets.  i also cooked longer than the stated amt. of time b/c i am not particulary fond of crunchy veggies.  would i make again?  maybe, using lemon pepper.

I tossed everything together and dumped it into a baking dish and baked it at 400* for about 30 minutes. Then I broiled it for about 5 minutes to brown the top. Completely delicious and easy. Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I loved that they retained some of their crunch- the perfect compliment to my risotto!  It was hands down the best zucchini recipe I have found.

This was such a lovely surprise.  I expected it would be good, but it was very, very good and so simple.  I have never cooked zucchini without garlic before, so I wasn't sure this would be flavorful enough but the lemon zest does something amazing to the zucchini.  Thanks, Judy this is a keeper!

I searched for a recipe containing zucchini and Parmesan cheese, and after looking at quite a few options I settled on this one.  Good choice!  I did add some garlic and was generous with the Parmesan cheese.  I do typically prefer zucchini chopped up in thin circles rather than these large chunks, but I did the large chunks because the recipe called for it; I'll probably do the circles next time, but that's just a personal preference.  Really great recipe, thank you!

Simple, yet delicious side!  I really love zucchini and enjoy trying it prepared in different ways.  I did add 2 cloves of fresh garlic towards the end with a good couple of shakes of red pepper flakes for some spice.  Yummy!

These were delicious!  I have never had zucchini before and, in an attempt to start eating healthier, I am trying some new veggies.  Instead of lemon peel, I just threw in a dash of lemon juice.  We also put these on the grill for a few minutes, until they had some nice grill marks.  The light "green" flavor and "grill" taste were a great combination!

If I could give more stars I would! My 5 year old daughter (who hates squash) asks for it every night now.
I like to make add a little parmesan while frying for the "burnt" cheese taste, and cook until blackend. Mmmmmm! So tasty! My daughter and I fight over the blackest pieces.
Thank you!

I thought these were pretty good. Zucchini isn't really the most exciting veggie, and I thought this recipe did a good job dessing it up a bit without overpowering the flavor. Good simple side dish recipe.

I need to find zucchini recipes because our veggie garden is over producing them this year - and this is definitely a keeper. The grated lemon peel is perfect!

i  made this and it was such a simple, easy, 4 ingredient meal (not counting salt and pepper)...i skipped the lemon peel and added a little soy sauce during the cooking process.  this took a total of ten minutes from prep to plate and it's DELICIOUS!  i ate it with a t bone steak instead of potatoes...much healthier alternative for a side dish.  thanks!

This was really good. i liked the spear shape and the addition of lemon and parmesan cheese. I did add garlic which went with the lemon pepper garlic chicken I had grilled. Might try it on the grill next time.

These were good... I would suggest you cook the zuchinni enclosed in foil in the oven and open up for the last couple minutes of cooking.

This was a great recipe!  We love zucchini and are always looking for new ways to cook it.  I used lemon juice instead of the zest.  Tasted great.  Next time I might try adding so minced garlic.

Pretty good and easy to make. A good side dish, as it doesn't have a really assertive flavour. Unless you are real zucchini lovers, this recipe makes more than 2 servings. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice. Both times I used lemon juice instead. The first time I didn't have parmesan cheese with me. It tasted pretty good and was very easy to make. The second time I added the grated cheese and it tasted even better. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is the only way I knew how to eat zucchini.  But instead of frying I have always steamed them.  Put them in a serving dish, drizzle with good EVOO and parm, salt and pepper. It is excellent.  I did not use lemon.  It is a great winter veggie since it always seems harder to get good "greens" as it gets colder.

Great recipe Judy! Friends keep giving me zukes from their garden, so I'm always looking for ways to prepare them. For some crunch, I toasted  and seasoned panko bread crumbs and added in the parm. My family and our good friend akleinschmit really enjoyed this dish. Thank you!

This was good but I made it a second time with some changes that were even better. I used grated four cheese blend and put the zuchinni on my grill. They were so sweet and the cheese melted nicely.
