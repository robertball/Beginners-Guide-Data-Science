As written this is a definite 4 star keeper. For my own taste I thought it needed a little more. I used 3 types of vinegar (which came to more than 2 tablespoons total: white balsamic, red wine and rice vinegars. I tossed in a generous handful of baby spinach leaves chopped up, cucumber slices halved and about a dozen mini mozzaball cheeses cut in half. I added some halved black olives and leftover coked string beans too. Also for my own taste I included a 2nd jar of marinated artichoke hearts along with the marinade, didn't use the plain kind in water (the recipe doesn't say which type to use).

Make this for your bookclub.  Make it for your next picnic.  Make it for a potluck.  Add feta cheese and grilled chicken and call it dinner.  The point is, make it.  Very good as is, next time I'll add more marinated artichoke hearts or maybe just cut them bigger, add more basil.  This is infinitely tweak able but make it as is the first time, to see where you want to go.  Since I grow my own cherry tomatoes and basil, I'm already halfway there in July and August.

Five stars at my 8 year old daughter's request.  It was quick and easy on a hot day.  I doubled the basil, added extra artichoke hearts (we used frozen), and added 2 T mayo to the dressing.  Served with chopped string cheese on top.

I added chickpeas which helped make it a great vegetarian meal!  I also used a can of artichoke hearts not the marinated kind.  This is delicious!

This is a great versatile recipe. Tasted lovely with some fresh ciabatta bread, had lots left over so stored it in the fridge and had a few days later for lunch. I did leave out the artichokes

Made as is and found it to be very blend.
