I thought this was an excellent pie.  I gave it 5 stars not only for taste but ease & convenience.  It's nice that the filling doesn't have to be cooked on the stove prior to baking (like some sugar pie recipes).  I made this recipe with the No Roll Pie Crust II from this site and our grandmother's would be envious at how little time baking a pie from scratch can take....and still turn out great.  The only thing I did that the recipe doesn't state is I put the pie in @ 400 on the bottom rack for 10 mins, then turned the heat down and placed the pie on the top rack for the remaining cooking time. That's just something I do for all my pies because it helps prevent a soggy crust.

SOOOOOO GOOD! What a treat. I also made it with Graham crust. Fantastic. Must let cool thoroughly.  It doesn't look set from the oven after 40 minutes, but if you let cool long enough and you can resist it, it will firm up.

I ended up making this pie because I had a crust ready and all the ingredients on hand.  I did make a few adjustments, though.  I added 1T of cinnamon which was really yummy.  I also used a little extra flour.  And I had to bake it longer than stated.  To get it "set" I baked it for 45 min.  It still seemed runny, so I turned my oven down to 170 and left it in another 10 minutes.  Perfect!

This is yummy and very easy!

I have a severe dairy allergy, and was looking wistfully at my kids' Halloween haul full of chocolate, caramel, and other goodies. I started daydreaming about chess pie. This recipe looked quick and simple, so I did the following:

1. Substituted soy milk and butter-flavored Crisco for the milk and butter, respectively.
2. Tossed a tortilla in the bottom of a pie pan, because I didn't have a pie crust handy and didn't want to make one. It turned out fine, just with a *very* thin crust, which is what I expected. I only tossed in the tortilla to protect the bottom of the filling while it baked.

3. Made the recipe without any other changes.

Results: Awesome! It's rich and wonderful, just what I wanted.

However, it didn't set very quickly at all. After 40 minutes in the oven, I turned the oven off and left the pie in to see if that would help. 

I think it might be prettier if I'd chilled it after baking, and only cut into it when it was very firm.

But, all I was going for was yummy and easy to satisfy a selfish sweet tooth after Halloween, and this fit the bill perfectly.

It's good, but it is not something that is presentable. It looks like rootbeer slop! I think the recipe calls for too much butter. It hardened and it looks like liquified rootbeer candy or something. A nice dessert to satisfy my brown sugar cravings but I would never serve this to anyone because it looks horrible!

Made this pie for the first time and it turned out great!!  It was delicious.  Just like a butter tart.  I followed the advice of one of the other reviews and stared by baking @ 400 degrees for 10 mins and then finished off 325 for 40mins.  It was perfect!!

Delicious. I substituted 1/2 cup real maple syrup for 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, and increased the flour to 2 tsp, then added half-and-half cream instead of milk.  The pie baked up perfectly and brought back great culinary memories from Quebec!  Let cool completely before cutting.  This is even better if you make it the day before you serve it (if you can wait that long to dig in!)

This one is very thin: it should be better to bake it in a 9" TART pan. However, it's a good sugar pie, with a crunchy top and a smooth filling. 37 minutes in the oven were perfect.

Easy! Easy! Easy! What a great recipe! I tripled the recipe, made 30 tarts and 1 pie. Everyone commented on how good they were and not too sweet. Next time I will try adding raisins to the mixture.

Love this recipe.I changed the cooking time around a bit.First cooking this pie at 325 degrees for 25 min's then reducing it to 300 degrees for an additional 25 min's. Oh, and adding 2 extra tsps of flour made this pie firm just perfectly.Hats off to ya hon. Most delicious indeed!

FANTASTIC TASTE!  ...However, I followed the recipe exactly, cooked the pie for 40 minutes, and let it set... for two hours.  It still hadn't hardened up, and here it is the next day and it is still mush.  Very tasty, but I am disappointed that it did not turn out, as I need a pie for school.

This was super sweet (which you would expect from something called a sugar pie).Was the filling supposed to be runny? Not a problem. We ate it anyways. Hope a night in the refrigerator tightens it up. We topped it with whipped cream. I'd like to try this again with the addition of raisins or currants.

I was surprised by the eggie flavor and soft texture however, I found both those elements to enhance the flavor of the pie I really enjoyed and it and I would make it again.  I made my own crust (which I have never done before) and it came out great! Thanks for the recipe it was delicious I love brown sugar!!

I am rating this recipe a 4star. I added 1/2 tsp more of flour because of complaints of soupiness and I cooked it until it stopped jiggling (50 mins). The last 20 mins I placed foil over the top to help stop over browning of crust edges.  My husband said it was a “keeper!”  He loved it.

I have made this pie twice now - the first one turned out PERFECTLY and the second one is runny but still tasty. I couldn't wait to eat the second one so it might have set up if I had been able to wait.  I followed the suggestion to bake for 10min at 400F on the bottom rack and this resulted in a perfect crust both times.  I also increased the flour to 2tbsp to make sure it would set up.  All in all, a super easy recipe with great flavour and it impressed the dinner guests.

I have to say that it tasted great! My little brother liked it and he doesn't like anything. the only thing I didn't like (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that it wasn't very good looking. It fell way too much and the crust on top cracked and made it unpresentable. But for taste it's great!

Not as great as I had hoped after reading all the great reviews.  It did not set and needed almost an additional 20 minutes of bake time.  Then it just kind of sank in the middle.  Taste was ok, but not worth it to make again.

This pie was great! Very good and so easy my boyfriend made it in about ten minutes!  Tasted just like pecan pie without the pecans. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I tried it topped with pecans, and it was a hit.  My husband thought it was a bit too sweet, but then again, he thinks that about just about everything.  This is an easy way to satisfy a major sweet tooth!

I cut the recipe in half and added about 1/8 t of salt, then loaded it with pecans, delicious alternative to pecan pie that you don't need to worry about being runny plus no corn syrup.

My mother used to make a brown sugar chess pie on occasion although her most-often made pie was plain chess. I was craving brown sugar pie recently and since she's been dead almost 30 years, I couldn't ask her so I found this one. She rarely measured anything,  but I can tell you if she made this it would have more like a tablespoon of flour than the teaspoon called for here and only about 4 Tb of butter.  That is what I used after reading the reviews about it being too sloppy. I didn't have any trouble with mine making those changes. (Of course, she would have just thrown some flour in by hand and added a chunk of butter! I got as close as I could!)

I used a can of cinnamon rolls for the crust, after getting rave reviews from friends, I tweaked it by adding 1/4 C of chocolate chips scattered around...so good!

Just like my grandmother used to make!  I used dark brown sugar because that’s what I had on hand and made sure I beat the eggs well before adding them to the other ingredients. Baked 10 minutes at 400 degrees on the bottom rack then 40 minutes at 325 in the middle rack. Served with whipped cream. Wonderfully simple...

I give this recipe 5-stars on taste and ease. However, I'm curious if the temperature is wrong. I baked it for 40 minutes at 325* and it was in no way close to firming. I had to cook it and additional 25min to get it to set.

I really wanted this pie to work. Made it the day before for "Pi Day." Its slop. I baked it according to the directions-325 40 minutes. It puffed up in the oven and looked beautiful until it cooled. It decompressed and the top layer cracked. That was a sign. I refrigerated it over night. Cut it for dessert and it ran out of the shell over the plate. There is a thin layer on top that resembles chess pie but the liquid underneath does not set and tastes like raw caramel. If you make this bake much much longer than what's written.

Absolutely delicious. I chose an all-butter crust and blind baked it first, which might not be necessary...but the results were excellent. This version has a denser texture than version I, more brownie-like versus custardy, which I prefer. Serve with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream.

I don't like nuts and have always wondered what a pecan pie tasted like! It always looked delicious (minus the pecans). Now I get to eat it just the way I've always wanted to! Thank you for the recipe!

This is very good but very sweet (I even cut the white sugar down to 6 tablespoons). It's like a pecan pie without the pecans, however I love pecans so I thought it was lacking. Everyone at the party loved it though. If you're into chess pie, you'll love this.

It was very good but not the recipe my stepdad has been searching for, It was like a great pecan pie filling not too sweet.  I did read that a lot of people said it was runny so i added one teaspoon of kraft minute Tapioca, it did the trick!

My friend went to Montreal, Quebec and had Sugar Pie for dessert at an upscale restaurant and was raving about it ever since. Being French Canadian he asked me if I had a sugar pie recipe. While I was waiting for a family member t find me one translated to English, I found this recipe. It is so easy to make! Just make sure you have a really good pie crust recipe or just use a ready made one you find in the freezer section at your grocer's. He said this is just as good or better. Love it! Thank you!

Quick and easy tarts recipe for school bake sale. Made 20 tarts. After reading the reviews, I decided to add 1 egg yoke and it wasn't runny. Will do again.

Super delicious treat (although next time, I will cut down the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I had a left over pie crust that I wanted to use up, and this was the perfect solution.  This is basically a dump recipe and can easily be done from start to finish in under an hour (if you have a pre-made pie crust!)  The consistency of the filling is that exactly of the pecan pie, but without the pecans.  Very rich, so you can serve smaller slices to cover more people.  Also might try topping it with whipped cream and or chocolate sauce!

This is more like a butter tart. Good but even after cooling down, it was runny. Would taste better with pecan or raisins.

This pie tasted very good, but the texture was a little odd. Also, it did not have a very pretty presentation. Mine had cracks in the top. Also, while eating this pie, I realized it was missing something. Pecans! Even though I usually eat pecan pie just for the sugary filling, ironically I miss the pecans in this pie. I think in the future I will stick to pecan pie.

This pie was very tasty. I added some chopped pecans which gave it a nice texture and flavor. However, the pie was much runnier than I had expected. I needed to bake it for longer, and it sunk a bit. Then it needed to be cooled in the refrigerator for half an hour. Still, the flavor was very pleasing. I will probably not make it again because it didn't end up looking very nice, but it was worth the first bake.

This was a great pie, very very easy.  It set very well too, most sugar pies have a hard time setting properly.  Had a pecan pie taste.
