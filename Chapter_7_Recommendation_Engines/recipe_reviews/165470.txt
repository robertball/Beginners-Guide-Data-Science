I was careful to watch this very attentively, and because I did I was rewarded with beautiful  crisp/tender, steamed/browned asparagus - and I didn't bother to cover it at all.   Delightful, attractive,  and a pleasure to eat asparagus that was neither too crunchy nor cooked to mush. The onions and garlic were great flavor enhancers, but to kick it up a notch I sautéed some chopped yellow and red bell peppers along with the garlic and onions for additional flavor and garnish. Some halved cherry tomatoes would be nice too! Served this with “Pork Tenderloin Diane,” and “Lemon Pepper Pasta,” recipes also from this site. Hubs declared it a home run dinner, perfect to usher in spring.

This is a favorite in my house. I have made it plenty of times but without the onions. We love onions! I am definitely going to add them next time. I'm sure the extra ingredient will be a pleasant surprise.

I didn't think this one would turn out well. I suspected that the onion would overpower the flavor of the asparagus. But it turned out amazing! The white onion paired so well with the asparagus. I didn't get to brown it as dinner was running late, so I tossed the stalks in the garlic butter. I will be making this again soon!

It used a lot of butter for the amount of asparagus, but was very delicious and we would recommend it. You may be able to use olive oil in place of the butter for a healthier side.

Absolutely fabulous!  My husband, who doesn't even like aspargus, loved it.  So did my 5 year old.  Will definitely be making again and again!

It was ok but would be better with an extra clove of garlic and a LOT less butter.

I didn't change a thing, except used chopped garlic instead of sliced, but I thought this recipe was a little bland.  Seems like it needs something more.  I'll try adding some lemon pepper next time.

This was a nice simple quick way for asparagus. I had some green onions that I wanted to use up, so I put those in. Will make again.

this turned out AMAZING. now my favorite way to cook asparagus. i regularly sprinkled with salt while it was steaming and used only 1 tablespoon butter and it turned out very buttery and salty. would not suggest using 3 tablespoons of butter for this recipe.

My new years resolution was to eat more vegetables, and I've made this recipe 3x this week! I did not make any changes at all, except for using Smart Balance in place of regular butter. This will definitely be a regular in my house from now on. The next time I make it, I might try a little parmesan cheese on top as well. Thanks for such an excellent recipe!

This was very tasty!  Asparagus tastes best in simple dishes like this one!  I put the garlic through a garlic press because we don't like big chucnks of garlic.  This was delicate and flavorful.  Next to grilling asparagus this is my new favorite!

This is a nice, easy way to steam veggies but three tablespoons is way too much butter. I made it again with only one tablespoon of butter and I found that to be much better.

Simple, fast and really tasty. I've grilled and steamed asparagus, but never thought to brown it and loved how it turned out. We even scraped up the onions left in the bowl to put on our steaks.

This was very tasty.  We didn't use as much butter as the recipe called for and the aspargus turned out just fine.  We added more garlic and a some red pepper flakes.  Very good.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Prepared this just as written and it turned out great!  I enjoyed it much more than when asparagus is baked in the oven.  The steaming and then kind of stir-frying process kept it plump and juicy.  Will definitely repeat!

That was a beautiful recipe. I couldn't believe how nicely the white onions complemented the flavours of the asparagus. Just to put a small spin, I added two finely chopped red chillies into the dish, along with the garlic and it gave it a cook that we really enjoyed. Served it with couscous and sweet corn. Yummy.

These are good, a nice neutral side to just about anything. I steamed my onions a bit before putting in the asparagus because I like them very well done. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a good, quick basis for me to cook asparagus for the first time. I added green peppers and at the very end tomatoes since I had them on hand. The only thing I had trouble with is cooking them all together since the asparagus us so much longer.

I loved this recipe - easy and full of flavor! My bf is not a big fan of asparagus but seems to like a stir-fried version better. This recipe was the perfect combination of onions and garlic to really spice up some fresh asparagus. I didn't have onions on hand so had to use dried onions but the dish still turned out well. I served this with salmon and some oven "fried" sweet potatoes. A good combo.
