My family enjoyed this dressing. I thought the outcome was a bit sweet but I was the only one.  I used vegan worchestershire sauce because it is fish free, but not a sweet condiment so I don't feel it affected the overall taste. I added a dash of bitters to compensate. All-in-all it is a nice Caesar dressing. Will make it again with half the sugar though.

No more boring salads! Here's an easy to make Caesar dressing that quickly comes together in your blender! This can be easily adjusted to suit your taste. The horseradish adds the perfect flavor.

I love this recipe without the sugar.  I use a good spicy brown mustard when I don't have horseradish. When I make a double batch I cut down on the Worcestershire sauce because it gets too bitter.

Should have taken the advice of others, it doesn't need the sugar. I halved it and then tasted it and it was still too sweet.  I added more lemon juice to offset and it helped a bunch. Will use again but without the sugar next time.

Half the sugar and a clove less garlic. Delicious.

To sweet! To much sugar, otherwise good! Maybe 1 tsp sugar instead of 4.
