It was very good.  Took me awhile though but very tasty.  I always love a new version and love the pasta in the potato salad.  Green onions vs red onions - very good!

I didn’t have spiral pasta, so I used farfalle/bow ties.  Not so sure that we really cared for the addition of pasta to the potato salad, perhaps, we’re too traditional.  I measured everything so I know proportions were correct, but my hubby’s comment was that it tasted more like a pasta salad than a potato salad.  If I were to make again, I’d cut the amount of pasta in half (personal taste, perhaps).  We did like the dressing very much and the addition of the dill pickles.  One final comment, even scaled down, this makes a LOT.  I changed servings to 4, and there was enough for 6+ servings in this house.   I don’t want to discourage others from trying.  It was OK, just not my favorite, but with all recipes, personal taste does kick in on reviews.
