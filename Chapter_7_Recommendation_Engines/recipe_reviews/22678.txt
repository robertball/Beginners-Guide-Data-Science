This is the best ham, potato, and cheese soup I have ever had!!!  It was so easy to make and tasted wonderful!  It was a hit with my husband and son.  I used Velveeta cheese in place of the shredded cheddar because I did not have any cheddar.  It was so nice and creamy and full of flavor.  Definately a keeper!!!

My husband loved this. I simmered the ham bone and used the broth in the soup along with the ham pieces. I didn't add any salt.

This is my favorite soup of all time. The only change I made to the recipe is that I used chicken broth in place of the water to add more flavor.

The only rerason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I have added some processed cheese as some reviewers suggested, trust me, it does give that extra creamy texture that this soup needs. Regardless - it was a hit, and I will definetly make it again. IMO best cheese soop on this site. Straight to my recipe box.

Oh, and btw, don't overdo the ham, putting in too much will interfere with the rest of the flavours in this delish!

Yummy!!  Basic ingredients and easy to make.  If you like cream/cheese soups then this is a must.  The ONLY change I made was 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 cheddar.  Thanks for the great soup recipe!!

This was a good way to use left over ham. My situation was similar to the previous poster, I needed to make 12 servings and I did not have celery.  So, I substituted the salt for celery salt but only added two teaspoons (for 12 servings 2.5 tsp was indicated) of this. The ham I used was leftover shank I had in the freezer - no bone, I used that for ham and bean soup, and I did add a bit more than the recipe states.  I also added a little more water than called for because I wanted to simmer it longer.  I also had to substitute some of the cheddar cheese for american and mozzerella.  All in all very good, and simple to do in a pinch.  Note: my soup looked more orange and 'cheesy' than in the picture.

Wow! This is super nummy!! I recalculated for 12 servings, and made exactly as indicated. The only change I made is using a pinch of celery seed instead of chopped celery as I was out. I was looking for super simple so the other change I made was to put the water and vegies in a crock pot on low from approximately 9a-4p. I had my daugher turn the crock off at 4 when she got home from school (could have left it on low for the extra hour until I got home as the vegies were a little crunchy, so just depends on how you like your vegies...a little more crisp or a little softer). When I got home, threw in the ham and finished the rest of the recipe. Then turned the crock on high for about 45 minutes while I ran and got my other daughter from after school activities! Super Easy and this is one of the best tasting soups I have ever eaten! We will definitely be making again and again!!!

My family loved this!  I tried it once with chicken and that is good, too, but our favorite is with ham.  It is so rich and creamy!  A keeper for me.

This is really great.  I didn't have any ham at hand, but I substituted smoked turkey and it still turned out fine.  I made this for myself, but my mom came by and tried some...and then took what I had planned to be leftovers.  But tis a compliment nonetheless.  Thank you !

I like this recipe because you can add whatever vegetables you want and it still tastes good. Next time I will try Velveeta to make it even more cheesy.

very good and it didn't make a huge amount which was good.   I added extra cheese later for more cheesy flavor and crumbled up cooked bacon as I didn't have the meat.

We had this soup for lunch. We didn't have ham, so we put in pork stew meat chopped up. It was very good. I had a hard time limiting my helpings.

We call this "scalloped potato soup" because it tastes so much like Grandma's scalloped potatoes! It's truly delish! I decreased the salt to just 1/2 tsp for personal preference. Instead of stirring in the cheese, I just topped each bowl w/shredded cheddar. Comfort soup, for sure!!

This was incredible soup!!!  Creamy and very tasty.  My husband couldn't eat enough!  The only change I made to this recipe was that I added some chopped fresh chives right before serving since I had some in the fridge.  They added a nice flavor.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect as written.

I had some leftover kielbasa on hand, so I used that in place of the ham.  Oh my gosh is this some great comfort food.  This made a huge pot and it didn't make it for my lunch the next day *sigh*.

Great warm, creamy, comforting soup. I served it with lightly toasted garlic bread for dippers. YUM! My roomate told me it's the same soup that is served at the ski hill here. Next time I make this, I'll chop my veggies larger to give the soup a more chunky effect.

This was very delicious!  I adapted it to make it vegetarian by leaving out the ham and adding curry & a little cayenne to the simmering vegetables.  It's a keeper!

I love that this recipe uses real cheese instead of process cheese food.  It tastes wonderful and is easy to fix.  My whole family loved it, even my husband.  I'll be making it often!

Fabulous! This is a new family favorite, thanks for sharing this great recipe!  Great way to use leftover ham, you probably could use any kind of meat.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of corn (drained).  I also cooked the vegetables with a couple chicken boullion cubes for extra flavor.

This recipe manages to be both very, very good and quite easy. It's quick enough to be a weekday night dinner, and excellently flexible. I made mine with potatoes, onion, split peas and ham (what I happened to have on hand) and it was great. I'm also pregnant and home alone with my 3 year old for the next few weeks, and I was able to cook it in between comforting a starving toddler. This is going into my personal database of recipes. Well done.

This was a wonderful recipe.  It was very easy to make and very tasty.  I made it for a staff appreciation luncheon at school and everyone seemed to like it.  This will be one that I will make again very soon!

This is one of the best soups I have made.  This is delicious.  I've made it without the ham, and used different veggies, you can't go wrong with this.

Incredibly easy . . . tastes great!  My husband raved about it at home and work for a couple of days.  I increased the ham a little and decreased the salt.

I know I'll be making this again in the near future!

great soup, very hearty!  i also made mine a veggie version just by omitting the ham, but it was still fantastic!  a tad salty, but i think that might've been my fault.  to be on the safe side, i would just be sure to add salt to taste at the end instead of throwing it in with the veg in the beginning.  i also added more pepper, but again, that's probably suited to taste.

after reading others reviews I actually doubled the recipe! sounded like a delicious hearty meal! 
I also chose to use some velveeta. 
I didn't add any extra salt, the ham and cheese are plenty salty as is. 
will definitely make again!

This was quick and very tasty. Actually, it was even better the next day. I didn’t stray far from the recipe. I boiled my potatoes and carrots in water and chicken stock, but I sautéed the onions and celery in the butter. I added the ham to the butter just long enough for it to sweat, and then I whisked in the flour, milk and cheese. I served it with a splash of hot sauce. Next time I make it, I think I’ll add a little Worcester.

Instructions unclear I found it very difficult to go to Chuck E Cheese and kidnap the person who goes around in the Chuck E Cheese costume and throws tickets to all the kids but I got the job done and this was delicious.

This is the best soup I've ever had!  The only thing I did differently was use a can of chicken broth in with the water.  I doubled the recipe so I poured the broth in my 4 cup measuring cup and put water in to make up the difference to get the water/broth mixture up to 4 cups.  Will make more right away because I know this will disappear fast!

Overall very good. Next time I make it I will eliminate the veges & add some chopped leeks instead. I added a can of cheddar cheese soup to the finished cheese sauce which made it really yummy, good recipe.

This soup is really great. It is very cheesy and I would make it again. The only thing I would change about this soup is I would strain the vegetables before adding the cheese for MAXIMUM CHEESINESS . You can also use the cheese recipe alone for a great cheese sauce for nachos or anything else. You would just need to add some Rotel or salsa.

Very good soup. A bit off the diet, but it was cold tonight and sounded good. I threw in a cube of Knorr chicken bouillon for more flavor and upped the servings to 12. Nice quick dinner.

Excellent soup.  I made this tonight and it went over very well.  I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand and it was still good.  Doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers and I'm so glad I did!  Yum!

This was really good. The only change I made was using Velveeta cheese instead of shredded cheddar. That's what I had on hand. The soup was very thick, creamy and the flavor was great. My 12 yr old daughter has already asked me to make this again. Win!

Delicious!! I had ham broth leftover in freezer so used that instead of water, upped seasonings a little to our taste (Cajun spice, garlic powder, spicy Monterey seasoning)  This was wonderful, and not too big a batch.  Will make again now that cooler weather is here!
