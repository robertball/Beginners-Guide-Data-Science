Made a version of this with what I had on hand.  Used 8oz creamcheese and 1/2 a tub of caramel dip.  The stuff you use for apples.   Mixed together  spread in dish and drizzled with Hershey chocolate syrup.  Again it was what I had on hand.  Sprinkled with pink sea salt.  Everyone loved this at both the parties I took to!
