Both my strawberries and bananas were frozen which eliminated the need for ice. This was good but quite runny. Next time, I'd cut the milk back by half. It seems to be missing something--I can't put my finger on it.

I thought this smoothie was "watered down" way to runny for my taste. I feel a smoothie should be thick and full of fruit flavor, this was neither. The addition of wheat germ is a great idea and i recommend adding it. Cut the milk down alot and add yogurt, the honey is not necessary as the fruit is already sweet.

Very delicious and refreshing. I loved adding honey instead of sugar. If your berries are very sweet you might not need to add the honey. Instead of adding ice, I made sure my berries were frozen. You can substitute flax seeds for the wheat germ as well. YUMMY!!

Very good smoothie!! A little too much of a banana taste for me so I added more strawberries, other than that it was great!

Good smoothie. Did not change the the amount of the ingredients a bit, except for including 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract to add to the flavor. Not sure why there are negative reviews about the smoothie being watery. More than likely it was the blender and/or their blending technique. Fortunately own a Blendtec blender. Threw in all the ingredients with the ice on top. Hit the smoothie button, and the recipe turned out perfectly thick, smooth, and creamy.

I had some strawberries left over that were starting to get past it's edible date.  Was looking for a smoothie recipe to go with some bananas I just bought so as not to waste them.  This recipe was so easy and most if not all would have the ingredients at  home without having to run to the store.  Tastes delicious for a hot summer afternoon.  My husband is not a big fruit eater and he loved it!

I loved making this smoothie but I find that when I make it, it tends to be very warm, I haven't tried these options yet but I was thinking about adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream

The bananas I used were bigger then normal so I only used 1-1/2. Mine was very frothy which was really good I think you need more strawberries or less honey if you want more of the strawberry taste. The honey can be a little overwhelming at times. Overall very delicious

I only used one banana and since I was out of honey, I used a small squirt of  sugar-free syrup (sweet enough for me). I also added a 1/4 cup of greek vanilla yogurt. It's very tasty but I agree with using a little less milk.

I used almond milk and a berry blend of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. Very tasty and easy to make! Wish I had added yogurt to make it more creamy though.

I think this is very good, but if I were to change anything, I would have put sugar in it. Or maybe a bit more honey. It was just lacking some sweetness for me
