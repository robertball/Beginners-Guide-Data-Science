I thought this recipe was awesome!  I tried this for my Christmas party last night and the dip was  a big hit!  I used  red food coloring with almond extract in one bowl, and green food coloring with coconut extract in another bowl.  Everyone loved it!

How could you go wrong with marshmallow fluff and cream cheese?  You can't!!  I added some Cool Whip for a party and it was ever better!  We sat and ate the dip without the fruit for awhile - lol.

My boyfriend and I made this for our Christmas party the other night and it was a hit! Everyone loved it, especially the dip! We used Angelfluff's idea and colored half the dip red and the other half green. There was absolutely nothing left at the end of the night. We will definitely be serving this again at our New Year's party!

I had a flat of strawberries on hand and bananas (prepared with fresh lemon and sweet lime juice so not to brown) so I added them to the salad and it really made all the difference! I also added a couple ounces more of the marshmellow creme and it was superb.

The fruit salad was pretty good, except for the papaya, which I found out I don't like.  I thought the dip was wrong, though.  It would have been a lot better with berries.

Just had this for a "Not-Luck" Lunch. It was great!! People were eating the topping by itself at the end! Delicious and refreshing. A little bit of the tropics in frosty January!

You don't have to like kiwi or alter this recipe at all. I hate fruit salad but ate it because that was the easiest thing for our barbeque. I loved this fruit salad and so did everyone else who ate it. Perfect.

Delicioso! This was very good and the topping was rich and creamy. I don't like kiwi, so I left it out. I think next time I will add more fruit too like strawberries and bananas and maybe grapes. I loved this, thanks!

I did not like the consistency of this recipe, it had more of liquid consistency than I thought.

I made this for a retirement party where I work.  Everyone loved it. The guys used the dip for their veggies.  It took 2 hours to chop all the fruit but it was worth it.  Thank you for a great recipe

This was so good it almost qualifies as dessert (okay, given the sugar content it DOES qualify as a dessert).  The combination of fruits was terrific, though I did add bananas as well to make it go further.  I served this at a large family dinner and found that many adults did not add the topping, but ALL of the kids did.  I will probably make this again, perhaps without the dressing, which was yummy, but not really needed.  I may also make the topping to serve as a fruit dip; it would work well for all kinds of fruit.

Excellent fruit salad! I did allot of add in's with this though. Such as watermelon, cantelope, honeydew melon, strawberries and blueberries. 
The dip was great a hit with the kids ;-) the adults not so much, so was very happy I served the dip on the side.

I used low-fat cream cheese and it was still very good! You should try this!

Didnâ€™t use the same fruits, but that fruit dressing is EXCELLENT! Delicious as is. The second time I processed some canned crushed pineapple w/juice into it, and we loved that as well.

Great recipe - easy, tasty and pretty to serve.  As to the only critical review, of course the dressing is sweet - look at the ingredients but a little of this is very complimentary to any fruit.  People always love this.
