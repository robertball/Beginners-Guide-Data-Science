To get that "popular fast-food taco restaurant" texture to the ground meat(being beef, turkey or whatever). Just add water before cooking to the crumbled meat and stir well and frequently as it browns. This helps the meat separate. You can drain the excess fat of when the water has cooked out of it, but I do not recommend rinsing it. Add more water before adding the seasoning if needed. I, personally, just add the seasoning once the meat starts browning and just let the water cook out. You will end up with that crumbly texture that I just love about that certain, unnamed taco place. This works with those little packets too. Great recipe!

Pretty good.  Homemade seasonings are definately better than buying those package mixes.  As far as the corn flour, it's essential for the flavor, but I did feel the overall taste was a little bland.  To answer a previous question, corn flour is like masa used in various latino foods.  It's not the same as corn starch.  It's found in the mexican food isle of the grocery store and sometimes is called corn masa or masa harina.

was just wondering what corn flour is, somewhere I read it is cornstarch is that correct?  I used cornstarch and it tasted great...but is that what I was supposed to use?

Great recipe! I tweaked it a little. I used shredded chicken, doubled the water and put it all in the crock pot for 3 hours. It turned out really well! My husband said, "This tastes like Taco Bell!" without even knowing that it was supposed too. My husband really enjoys fast food, but I rarely let him have it. Now, I can make it at home! And there's no mystery about what the meat is!

Very good spice mix for Mexican foods without the extreme salt content that many packaged mixes have.  To make it as convenient as the envelope mixes, I make enough to fill an empty spice jar leaving out the beef granules as they too increase the salt content using low sodium beef broth in place of water while cooking the meat.   NOTE:  Corn flour is corn masa and helps bind the spices to the meat which is an integral part of this recipe. Hope that helped answer the question that others had.  Enjoy!

I used corn meal since I had it on hand, instead of corn flour, and the results were still great!

This was a fine substitute for the packaged seasoning you get at the store. I was in the middle of making tacos when I realized that I was out of those packages. Thank goodness for this recipe! I didn't have the corn starch or the garlic salt, but it came out fine anyway. Great substitute in a jam! I might just use this recipe from now on. The only down side is that it does take more time to measure all the ingredients than it would just to rip open a packet.

Suffice it to say, we all flock to cooking websites to rate recipes based on taste.  I'd like to not only tout how delicious this recipe is, but also point out that it's very friendly to those on a gluten-free diet, as well as those with mild-to-moderate IBD/Crohn's.    I was amazed not only at how tasty the seasoning blend was, but also how I didn't feel downright icky afterwards like I do with pre-packaged mixes.  This is worth making to the exact recipe, perhaps in big batches to store in the pantry for those nights when all you want to do is fry up some taco meat.

This seasoning mix was AWESOME!!  Taste like the restaurant style but without the high sodium content and the "aftertaste" the boughten package mix has.  This will be a standard for me, plus I'm going to make some of the spices up to give as gifts for friends as well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was very tasty taco meat. Nice mild chili pepper flavor, nice texture. I used the whole cube of bouillion instead of granules. Tastes just like On The Border's. Hubby asked me to repeat this one every time I make tacos from now on. Thanks!!!

This is awesome.  I tried this for my husband because I've never been fond of packaged taco seasoning.  I actually used this seasoning on one pound of ground turkey, but I left the measurments of the dried seasonings as is.  I reduced the amount of water to 2/3 cup.  It turned out great and my husband absolutely loved it.  He was even shocked to discover that I'd used turkey meat...said he couldn't tell the difference.

I was looking for a mild flavor taco seasoning that I could make right here at home. This was perfect as I had all the ingredients on hand. I used a little less of the red pepper flakes as some family members prefer it mild. I also used corn masa for the corn flour, which is corn flour, found in the hispanic aisle inside the grocery stores. A 5 lb. bag will usually cost about $6.00. I also use corn masa to make tortillas and tamales. For this recipe, I used it to make, "Taco Salad I," also from this website. I used ground turkey meat in place of lean ground chuck. Once I cooked the meat, drained the grease, I added the seasoning and half the amount of water. The seasoning is a good flavor with a mild taste, which is what I was looking for. This recipe also leaves room to increase the amount of spiciness to the mixture if one desires.

Excellent!  Made for taco salad, with some minor subs for ingredients on hand; i.e. corn meal for corn flour.  I don't keep garlic salt or seasoned salt in my pantry, so I added a half teaspoon salt.  I didn't add the dried minced onion since we were having taco salad, but would for tacos.  Also wasn't sure if ground red pepper was cayenne or ground red pepper flakes, so since I had some ground red pepper flakes leftover  from another dish, I used that.  Even on low heat, the liquid cooked off quickly.  I thought the meat was a little spicy on its own (not real brave in the heat department), but it was perfect for the salad.  Will definitely use this recipe from now on.  I've made a couple of the taco seasoning recipes on AR, and liked them okay, but like this spice combo is much better!

To truly get the resturant quality taste put your browned hamburger meat through a food processor for 2-3 minutes. Afterwards place the meat in a seperate bowl and proceed to add your dry ingredients for theseasoning along with water as needed to absorbs the seasoning. Stir well and then re-microwave. I'd also suggest adding 2-3 spoonfls of salsaand 1 teaspoon o red pepper flakes.

This recipe was so yummy! I used regular flour instead of corn flour.  I fried half of a medium onion and 3 cloves of garlic with the meat.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes when the seasonings were added to the meat.  I will definitely make this again!

This is very good. I don't care for the envelope mixes and many times make a very simply spiced meat for my tacos but hubby prefers a little more seasoning and this was perfect for both of us. I followed the suggestion of diamar and cooked the meat in water to help break it up and did not drain it. Since it was 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef there wasn't a lot of fat but what was left after cooking off a little added to the flavor and texture.

Made this tonight for tacos on the fly, and it was good. Also, no MSG like package mixes only IF you leave out the beef bouillon like I did. I don't think it would've added much anyway. Using cornstarch instead of masa (corn flour) also works well. Im thinking I'll mixup a decent size batch of this seasoning, while I already have everything out, just to have ready to go. Thanks for posting :-)

This is really good.  I also used corn starch instead of the corn flour cuz I didn't have that.  I think the garlic salt could be omitted, it is a little on the salty side.  Also, came out a bit greasy for me so next time I will rinse the meat before adding spices.

This was very good.  I didn't do it exactly.  I had some beef broth left over so I used that rather than water and I let it simmer about 2 hours just because I could.  I also used the same amounts listed but for 2 pounds of beef was perfect for us.  I agree it needs a little something...I just don't know what that is.  This will be what 
I use for tacos in the future.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really easy and very good. 
The only changes I made were omitting anything with salt (meaning no 
seasoning salt and instead of the 
garlic and onion salt, I used 
additional garlic and onion powder).
We used a couple extra tablespoons
of water, as well.  This is a great addition to anyone’s 30 minute meal
list. We’ll make this one again.

Very tasty.  I used only garlic powder-probably a full tablespoon.  We also browned up minced onion, jalapeno and bell pepper with the meat.  I think I will make up a big batch of this mix to share with my kids.  I like the low sodium content of this mix.

This was really good.  I followed the directions exactly (including rinsing the meat with hot water) except I took the advice of another reviewer and added the water while browning the meat.  This helped it get that texture everyone likes.  I also added a little tomato paste while browning.  Then I drained and rinsed and put it back in the pan with water and some more tomato paste.  Then added seasonings and cooked down.  I liked the seasonings because it had just enough spiciness, while the small amount of sugar added a nice balance.

This seasoning mix has become my staple.  The only thing I do differently is that I use corn masa instead of corn flour, because that is what i keep on hand.  Thanks!!

came out great, made it with the cornstarch instead of the corn flower because i didn't have it.  I also made it with ground turkey meat - which was surpisingly good.  will definitely make again.

This recipe makes the same mistake that I made before discovering the traditional method used by Mexican restaurants. The mistake is in browning the meat first. I went to the kitchen of a famously taqueria and asked how they made the ground beef that we all know as restaurant quality ground beef. The secret is to put the beef in with the onion and spices into cold water. Bring it to a boil and cook until consistency is what you like. This is a good recipe otherwise.

This went over well. I didnt have corn flour. I didnt add as much water so I don't think it missed it. I would have used corn starch probably if I would have needed it.

Fantastic! All of the seasonings really elevated the simple homemade taco to something special.  And it does taste just like a restaurant!  I made it with ground turkey and dissolved the beef bouillon cube in the water. 1 cup is a bit too much water, though--2/3 or even 1/2 would have been fine.

This taco meat is as good as any restaurant, and probably healthier since you rinse the meat.
I make a triple batch then freeze individual pkgs. for taco salads, burros, tacos, whatever we are in the mood for.

Fantastic flavor! I'm a spice-loving man so I doubled the ingredients for 1.5 lbs of ground beef and took the advice of another reviewer to brown my meat in water. You would have thought you just sat down to dinner at your favorite Tex-Mex restaurant! This one is definitely going in my box as the go-to taco recipe. Thanks for a super recipe!

Very good flavor. Didn't really know what corn flour was but used corn starch, could have used a little less or more water. DH said I don't need to buy that mix stuff any more :)

I tried this many many times and everyone loves it. I did make a few minor adjustments to the recipe though; (I cut the cumin by 1/3 and added fresh onions chopped and fresh garlic) turned out extremely well. Also, works well with enchiladas.

Very good, basic recipe.  I kicked it up a notch with some extra hot pepper flakes and some chilies.  We all have loads of seasonings in our cupboards, why not mix them up instead of buying the bottles for so much more $$.  :)

following the recipe it was a little salty so I would reduce the amount of salt and I also found it too much chili powder and would prefer more cumin so I balanced it out that way.

Restaurant Style Taco Meat Seasoning Haiku: "Weren't blown away. Not outstanding, but not bad. Still, easy to make." I definitely prefer AR's "Taco Seasoning I" blend (w/ a little added masa flour) to this one; not sure why we weren't all that impressed w/ this recipe as nothing about it particularly reminded us of "that" fast-food restaurant. I guess the ratio of spices along w/ rinsing the meat off just made for a less-than-enjoyed taco experience for us, but hey, nice to try something different!

Scaled this recipe up to feed a hungry army of 50 high school kids and it was a big hit.  I used the ingredient quantities as called for and it was mild (heat-wise) and flavorful but you could scale up the red pepper to increase the heat if you like. I actually adapted it for the crock pot.  Browned the beef in the skillet, then put it in the crock pot on high for 4 hours with everything except the corn masa - added that in the last 30min of cooking just to thicken it. Fantastic, everyone loved it!  I will be making this again for our family

I make this in big batches and keep it in my old "taco seasoning" container.  So much better than the store bought stuff!  And if you don't have corn flour, you can double the amount called for with regular flour :)

Since first trying this recipe, I never buy taco seasoning in the store, ever. You have control over the amount of salt that goes into your food and you can pump up the heat or tame it down to your families liking. I use it for beef chicken and pork. Thanks GVSWFE for a great recipe. 4/11/15 Up-date: I usually double or triple the recipe and then store the mix in a glass jar. It keeps well and is always handy since we all love tacos in our house. Today I'm making it to use with the 'Indian Tacos with Yeast' recipe also on AR. Yummy stuff!

Try this using corn meal ground in food processor.  To those who think this may be labor intensive, make up several batches at a time in individual foil squares. Fold into packets and store in plastic bag and Voila! they are ready to use when you need it.

I love this seasoning!  I've decided it's better for me to make a huge batch and store it so I can use it whenever...much easier than measuring those ingredients every time!  I have also used this on chicken to make chicken tacos and they came out very nice.  Super seasoning!!

Tastes awesome! Good to have a recipe that doesn't have so much salt or MSG as the packaged varieties.

Was delicious! We all really enjoyed it. I am going to make enough for a whole bunch of dinners at once, get an airtight container and store it for dinners when I can just pull it out and add it like it really is from a packet! lol! Passed it on to a friend and her husband and they both loved it as well! We didn't have corn flour so i used regular flour and it still came out great.

This tastes just like a local TexMex place that we go to. We had tried other packages from the store but none had ever come close. We were nervous with the amount of chili powder but even the young kids don't find it spicy. We have not bought store mixes since we came across this one.

I would prepare "as is" but would omit garlic salt.  Too salty with garlic salt and seasoned salt.  Otherwise, very good!

Yummy!  Made it with ground turkey and it was a hit.  I didn't rinse the meat, and I too add it in once the meat starts browning.  Plus, I just eyeball the water amount.  I like it almost like a dry rub.  Thanks for posting this!

The recipe calls for a spice or two that aren't in my cabinet. I substituted ground white for the ground red pepper. I didn't have garlic salt or seasoned salt, so i added a bit extra of regular salt and powder. Bullion was unnecessary too. I use vegetarian meat and I added a bit more water, and it came out superb....

Added fresh minced onion instead of dried. It was missing something until I added SMOKED paprika. That made it special.

This is a great go-to recipe.  Just made it and the flavor/texture is wonderful.  I plan on making a big batch and freezing so that all I have to do is defrost and voila.  I also served this with some macaroni pasta and sprinkled with cheddar cheese.  Easy hamburger helper ... my 6 year old loved it for her lunch!

There was nothing "special" about this recipe.  I have tried more spicy and less institutional tasting taco meat recipes.  With several adults eating, no one was especially enamored.

I agree with Diamar on the directions.  But the recipe itself is great!  I left out the red pepper flakes and used a 1/4 tsp. of chipotle seasoning I have on hand.  I didn't have corn flour, but used corn meal and it turned out good.  I don't use garlic salt, so I just added extra garlic powder and himalayan salt instead.  All my kids ate it, but my youngest ate it, which is the most impressive.  So for that alone, this recipe gets five stars!!  Hubby and I did feel it needed a slight bit of something, but for the kids, I think it's perfect.  Will definitely use again!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is the first time I ever made my own seasoning for ground beef tacos. No more packaged seasoning for me. This was so easy! I didn't have seasoning salt or garlic salt so I left those out. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great seasoning to have on hand.  I use it for fajitas as well as tacos. We like it better than the packaged kind. Those family members who prefer their seasoning a bit hotter just add hot pepper sauce to their individual tacos till their tongues smoke!

I've used this recipe several times as I always have the ingredients on hand.  It comes close to the taste of TB but it will be the sauce or salsa that you may choose to use that will bring the overall taste very close.  My son is the TB lover in our house and this satisfies him when he's wanting to go there but I am not.  We've used it for tacos & taco salads; still need to give "enchiritos" a try.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added extra corn meal (about a tablespoon more.)  I seasoned the ground beef for the, as we call it in Texas, Super Nachos I made. Perfect seasoning!  Thanks for sharing.

I was out of seasoning packets and needed something I could use in a pinch.  This was good, but a tad spicy for me, though I don't handle spice well.  My husband liked it as-is.  I will use it again, but cut back on the chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe.

After trying this you won't buy the packaged seasonings.  It is full of flavor. After I browned my meat and added seasonsings and warmed them all up, I put the meat into a mini crock pot to simmer for a hour or more and it's awesome! The low simmer time makes it 10 times better.  I made it just as it is lited.

I made it vegetarian and omitted the beef and beef boullion.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic and some onion as another reviewer mentioned.  In place of beef, I used TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein).  I'll use turkey next time.

We loved this seasoning mix!  It was so much better than what you buy in those little packets and a ton less salt.  I will never buy a taco seasoning packet again.  I have passed the recipe along and even thought about putting together small jars of it to give a Christmas presents.  Yes, it is that good!

This was pretty good. Not as good as a taco seasoning packet, I felt it wasn't spicy enough. Good to have this recipe on hand when I don't have the packet like last night.

Like others said, if you didn't know any better, you'd think you had made a "run for the border", winkwink.  A fantastic, EXACT replica!  

I'd also like to note that I used cornstarch in lieu of the corn flower, seemed to be a fine swap. And don't rinse your meat under water, just drain the grease, add seasonings and water and let it reduce.

It tastes NOTHING like any fast food restaurant I have been to! It actually tastes like Ortega seasoning packets from the grocery store. I will not make it again!

I made this recipe just the way it was printed excluding the corn flour because I didn't have any.  It was the best recipe I've tried and I have tried several. My family agrees that this is the best. It's very flavorful without being too salty. I will make this again. Now that i found this recipe there is no need to try another.

My family and I love this recipe!!! I've made it countless of times.  I don't add red peppers because it's to spicy for my little ones.  I also substitute ground turkey instead of beef.  I add less water of course because I use the turkey juices.  Turns out great!! No one even knows it's made out of turkey!!

Way too salty! I don't us store bought taco seasoning mixes because of how salty they are, and was hoping I could remedy that by making my own. I'm not someone who never eats salty foods either. The other 2 people who had it seemed to enjoy it. I will omit the salt next time and see if it's better that way.

This was excellent!  My husband loved it.  I made it as writte but only used 3 tablespoons in 1 lb of hamburger.  Thank goodness I doubled the recipe and now have extra for next time.  It is just as easy as a packet if you do this and is so much better.

I had to make 6 pounds of taco meat "pronto"! (So I just quadrupled each ingredient for a close approximation.) Despite missing a couple ingredients (no red pepper, replaced garlic powder with mince garlic from a jar, and used fresh onion), this recipe came out great with ground TURKEY. No, I did NOT wash the meat: browned it in some olive oil with the GRATED fresh onion, and simply added the water at the end. After cooking off the water, it looked great. At first the flavor was a little flat (due to that missing red pepper?), but later that evening the spicyness and saltiness came through nicely. Delicious!

Definitely better than the "fast food" quality flavor. I didn't have the beef bouillon granules, so I just omitted. It didn't need it. Plenty of flavor without it.

This turned out great, first time making taco seasoning from scratch and it was tasty. No more store bought for me, takes a few extra minutes vs opening a package but you know what ingredients are in there, and they're common ingredients!

Had guests coming for taco dinner and realized I was out of taco seasoning packets.  This was easy and delicious so I might not bother buying the packets again.  I didn't have corn flour so I sprinkled corn starch on top of the meat when it was simmering and mixed it in.

I use this recipe EVERY time I make tacos (which is about once a week, we love them so much). Simple enough. But I do use more spices than listed. So maybe 1 tsp instead of a 1/2 tsp, and less chili powder. After the initial seasoning, after the meat is cooked, I taste and season some more. I also add a bay leaf while it simmers. 
Great basic recipe though! I'll never buy taco seasoning packets ever again.

I did not have beef bouillon on hand so I used beef broth instead of water.  It cooked down much quicker than anticipated.  This was a very easy way to season taco meat... I shall never buy the seasoning packets again!

This was very good! The only change I made was to add an extra 1/2 t. of cumin only because I really like cumin.  I'm going to make some of the seasoning up to keep on hand.  No more packaged taco seasoning!

My family LOVED this!  My husband (who is my picky eater) said I could make it 24/7 and he'd never get tired of eating it.  I didn't have corn flour and substituted cornmeal mix.  It worked wonderfully!  I also pre-cooked the ground beef and mixed everything together later on.  Definitely will be making it again.

This is what I used for my enchilladas & taco meat recipe. I added a 1-teaspoonfull of the Cumin, it gave it more flavor.

I winged the amounts because I was in a rush and used shallots instead of the onions and onion powder because that's all I had on hand.  Deeeeelicous!  Will use this recipe forever.  You can't ruin it!  My kids, who are finicky loved it.

Really yummy and it doesn't have the powdery taste that you get with the packets.  I made it in the morning and kept in in the crock pot on low for 6 hours.

This was great, I did not add sugar I also did not have the corn meal so I just use a corn muffing mix. This is a keeper.

I've used this recipe for several months now, just as good as the or better then the store bought stuff. I have always just used regular flour in place of the corn flour.  Since my family doesn't do spicey to well I use less chili powder and just make up the difference with paparika- gives it the same color.

We didn't have any packets of seasoning, so came here to all recipes to find a solution. Gave this recipe a try since I had most of the ingredients, we were lacking a couple of things but it still came out very tasty. I am impressed with the flavor even minus a couple of items.
I would suggest this recipe if you want a change or if you don't want to use the packets of seasoning. Excellent!!

All that hype for a marginal taco?  If it were make this again or go out to "that taco place", I'll go out.  Wasn't bad, but this is nothing special at all.  Slightly better than the spice packets.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe except I increased the spices.  I like food with a bit more kick.  I doubled the cumin and added 3/4 t red pepper instead of 1/4 t.  I also added 1/2 c sweet onion to the beef when I was browning the meat.

I've tried a couple other taco seasoning recipes from this site and I like this one the best. I did use corn meal as I had no corn flour. This recipe is mild enough if feeding kids, but can easily be "kicked" up for those who enjoy more heat!

Easily 5 stars!  I hate when people change a recipe then review it, but I made such tiny changes that it won't matter.  I don't eat at Taco Bell so I can't compare it to that, but the recipe is fantastic nonetheless.  I doubled the cumin (I love cumin) and the pepper (I love spicy food).  I also used 90/10 lean ground beef and simmered it for an hour.  i just added a bit more water along the way.  We used this in a taco salad....SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!

My husband and I love this recipe and use it every time we make tacos or nachos.  Once you have all the spices on hand it is very simple to measure everything out...and probably more cost effective than the spice packs at the store.  I substitute corn starch for the corn meal and it works fine.  I also cut back on the salt a little bit too.  Try it, you'll like it!

Didn't taste quite like The Bell to me but it was still really great.  Much better than the packaged stuff.  Didn't have masa and wasn't about to run out for it.  I used cornstarch and it worked fine.  I'll definitely make it with masa in future as I'm sure it would add something to it.  Used in the Taco Pie from this site.  I'll use this recipe to make taco meat from now on.

This turned out amazingly well.  I got really tired of taco meat that was dry and flavorless, so I tried this.  I omitted the bouillon because I didn't want it too salty, just salted to taste after the liquid had cooked down a little bit.  I didn't have masa (corn flour) on hand so I threw some corn meal in the blender.  Worked great, very tasty, very easy!

My whole family loves this kind of taco meat.  I never buy pre-packaged taco seasoning anymore.  Instead of cornmeal, I just use cornbread mix, like jif or betty crocker.  I also skip the ground red pepper since I have several kids and instead of minced onion, I just saute diced onion with the meat while it is cooking.  Definately a keeper in our family!

Yum!  I actually thought it tasted better than fast food.  I didn't have the corn flour, but I saw that others used corn starch.  It worked just fine for me.  This didn't last too long in our home!

This recipe is great!  I have made it a few times now and each time it comes out perfect.  The taco meat is tasty and moist.  It turns out i had no onion powder, but the recipe still came out fine.  I used Adobo for the season salt and regular flour instead of corn flour.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made the recipe as written.

My three-year old ate two whole tacos and my 18-month old ate half of one taco.  That is really saying something about the flavor when both kids eat heartily.  My husband and I enjoyed the flavor as well.  I will definitely make it again.

This was excellent. And unlike the pre-packaged kind it was not salty and "fake" tasting. I also did not have any corn flour and used cornstarch instead and omitted the garlic salt.  Will definately be making again.

great stuff! Was having a Taco Bar so I cooked the meat up and put all other 
ingredients in the Crock Pot for a couple of hours favor turned out great.
Doubled the recipe and there was still no leftovers!!

This was good. Didn't knock my socks off, but considering what you pay for a packet of seasoning in the store, this is definately cheaper and the results are good.

This is a good recipe to use for those times when you are making tacos and realize you do not have any of the little store bought packets. I did not have all of the ingredients on hand (garlic salt, crushed red peppers and corn flour), but it still came out ok. I'm sure if I had all the ingredients it would have been a 5 star. I guess the fact that nobody noticed is a good thing!

This recipe makes great taco meat.  I did not have the corn flour and made no substition.  I did not have the beef granuals, but instead I mixed the water and 1 bouillon cube along with all the other seasonings then added the mixture to the beef.  I will definately make this again.

I was craving tacos but didn't have any pre-made packets.  I found this recipe and it was amazing.  I liked the recipe because it included how much meat goes with the recipe.  Absolutely delicious.

Excellent! Meat was tender and flavorful.  Much better than just frying it up with seasonings.  Braising it with the water made all the difference.

I like this recipe so much that I will never buy the prepackaged seasoning mix again. The only thing I changed was rinsing out the meat. I simply scooped up the excess fat. I know it's not as healthy, but it probably gave it more flavor. I served this on Chef John's homemade flour tortillas and both turned out so much better than any restaurant tacos. My husband couldn't stop talking about them.

I've made this a couple times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and liked it quite a bit, the subsequent times I've changed the spice ratios slightly for my family's taste. I prefer to add a full tsp of cumin and more red pepper but the recipe is really good all on its own!  The corn masa flour I used was made blue corn as well, I don't know if it really affects the taste much.

It turned out pretty good!  I thought a little too much corn starch, and maybe needed more cayenne pepper.  But we ate like pigs as it was.

Tried this recipe after wanting to up my taco game some from the standard American way of making them.  I followed the recipe to the letter, although I did cook the meat in the water as other reviewers recommended, and enjoyed how it came out, as did the family (kids eating without any complaints = definite win!).  
However, next time I do think I'll substitute beef stock for water & omit the beef bouillon granules all together.  Maybe leave out the garlic salt as well, either that or leave out the seasoned salt.  This recipe as-is is very sodium heavy.

This is wonderful! I have used this recipe for about a year now, and I am just now reviewing. I use finely ground cornmeal, because that is what I had in my pantry the first time, and now it is what I will always use. I have one tweak, and it is something I stumbled across when trying to get the exact flavor of a favorite fast food chain located only in my hometown: adding about 2 tbsp or up to 1/4 cup green enchilada sauce, depending on whether you are making a single or double batch of this. It gives it a slightly tangy, slightly  vinegary kick. It was just what I was looking for. My best friend and my husband agree. They both sampled the meat before and after adding the sauce, and it truly made a difference for us. Either way, this is a go to recipe for me. I make a double batch at least every two months and freeze it in individual and family size serving portions and use it for everything with a Tex-Mex or Mexican flavor.

I am so thankful for this recipe.  Most taco seasoning packs at the store have MSG which gives me headaches.  I made this with no substitutions and it was so good.  Hubby and kids enjoyed it too.  This one is a keeper!

Never need to buy taco seasoning again, this is terrific. I used corn meal instead of corn flour, gives the meat mixture a good consistency. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe numerous times but have never used the corn flour as it's not something I have on hand.  Great replacement for the packaged envelopes!

Solid recipe, bit high on the salt though. I'd cut out the garlic salt.

I used corn meal instead of corn flour, it's just to thicken up the final product. I also left out the minced onions and added some fresh chopped bell peppers and onions. This turned out great and I definitely recommend it for taco night!! Enjoy!

Yep, the key is to add the water right at the start, even more than you think looks right, then cook down. That is how to get the fast-food texture that sometimes you want.

corn flour is Masa Harina, for this recipe I love peppers so I added fresh/diced jalepeno (no seeds, just ribs), fresh anaheim peppers and diced green and red bell peppers. Also, I think fresh garlic is much better, at least granulated garlic instead of the garlic powder. I make a LOT of this at once, because I make a LOT of mexican food at home, so I set the entire garlic clove in the oven (while I'm baking something else) for a few minutes and then chop it up and add it. I like to first use beef broth, not a lot, but a good concentration, almost boiling to first brown the beef, then add the veggies (sauted in a separate pan), afterwards and let the whole recipe simmer quite a bit while I'm doing other things. The flavors marry very nicely, and I agree about using the food processor(today's ground beef is not the quality of my Mom's and grandmother's). I have drained the beef, ground it and added it back to the broth and let the broth cook down with the veggies, but mostly it's for texture. (The kids are picky, but at work, it's not that big of deal)

My fiance LOVES when I make these tacos, So of course I use this recipe often. I also made it for my family and they love it too. There are a few things I leave out of the recipe including corn flower, seasoned salt, beef bouillon and the sugar. In lieu of these ingredients I add a taco sauce usually mild and I put a few dashes of hot sauce in the mix .  I also put the recipe in the slow cooker and if I have time put it on the lowest time setting ( about 10 hours so I add more water approx 2 cups). Normally it doesn't take the whole 10 hours to cook, but I just prefer the lowest setting for any type of meat. It turns out great every time!

Excellent. I didn't have corn flour so I ground up some cornmeal to make it finer... seemed to work ok.  This is a great mix.

I love homemade seasonings. The seasoning mix added a lot spicy goodness to our beef tacos and taco salads.  I used masa harina for the corn flour. You can find masa harina in the baking aisle. I also store my masa harina in the freezer since I don't use it very often. Chili powder can also vary in heat levels. My family likes our Mexican food spicy and hot, so I went with a hot chili powder.

Quite tasty especially on taco salad. It's a little spicy for some in my family so I will adjust ground red pepper as needed.

Great!  I used white flour instead and trippled the seasonings.  Saved the extra in a glass jar.  Washing meat with hot water really helped remove the gamey flavor from the venison we were using!

Granted I was short some chili powder, but I really thought this need more flavor. And it wasn't HOT , and I don't like "hot" stuff.

I made the following substitutions: 1/4t. seasoned pepper + 1/4t. salt = 1/2t. seasoned salt; 1/4t. garlic powder + 1/4t. salt = 1/2t. garlic salt; 1/2t. crushed red pepper flakes = 1/4t. ground red pepper.  I made a double recipe and added some to the rice & beans before cooking them.  I used 4T to add to a 1.25lb tray of ground turkey and skipped the washing step.  It was all very yummy!  I will make more to keep handy!

It was a good substitute to the packets you get in the grocery store. Even though it was good something tasted like it was missing. I didnt have corn flour or beef boullion so that may have made the difference.I will however use again.

My family loved this seasoning. I used turkey instead of beef and my dad who won't even try anything healthy didn't even know that I wasn't using beef. Everyone like it so much better than the way we usually make tacos with the packet and beef. It was delicious!

This was such a great switch from the packet stuff.  I HATE tacos at home... and my husband loves them!  I would prefer taco bell anyday... until today!  I REALLY liked this.  I think next time I will use all hot chili powder instead of regular chili powder/hot chili powder mix that I used.  I think the extra little punch would be nice.  Also.. I didn't have paprika or corn flour.  Used corn starch and it was fine.  What added flavor would paprika do for it?  I really wonder that if anyone can help!
