The kids loved it. I added the rice uncooked like another review suggested. The rice on the edges were very hard and crunchy. I made it again and stirred the dish halfway through the cooking time making sure to get the rice on the sides were moved around. It worked perfect and it was all nice and soft. Great recipe!

How could I not give my favorite comfort meal a 5-star!  If you like a cheesy version just add about 3/4 can of cheese sauce. Don't cook the minute rice, just add it uncooked.

Simple and Delicious! I made one small addition. I stirred in about half a cup of milk before sticking it in the oven.  I have a bad track record with baked rice and didn't want to end up with another crunchy rice dish.  Halfway through I stirred in another half cup of milk as the dish looked like it wouldn't have enough moisture for the rice to finish cooking.  It turned out great.

It's a quick and easy recipe that my child loves (we really like it, too). And it is easy to add other ingredients if you would like.  We add a vegetable, like peas or corn, to it.

I really wish I could've given this a 3.5 instead of a 4. The good thing is it makes something pretty good out of a bunch of stuff you probably might already have in your cupboard. Now the bad part is it is WAY too salty! You do not need to add any extra salt to this at all because there is way more than enough in the soups. I think this would be better with low sodium soups. I had expected the mixture of noodles and rice to be really weird but it wasn't. They both kinda blended together and you couldn't really differentiate one from the other. So all in all this wasn't too bad but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Very simple but surprisingly tasty. I think it would be better with some chopped green pepper along with the onion, and maybe shredded cheddar added to the top near the end of the baking time.

I made this one night when I could not think of anything else to make. Boy, did we enjoy it! My husband and son were both wanting to eat the leftovers for lunch, although there was only a little bit left. I will definitely make this again.

I was looking forward to trying a recipe that was a "my mom recipe". It did sound like odd-ball 
Ingredients but I gave it a shot. My picky husband said it was a keeper, and I did enjoy it too.
It was just what I needed as a working wife who still cooks every night, easy, fast to get together
and tasty in a "comfort food" type of way.  Thank you so much Augustana for sharing!

I was looking for something quick and easy to make the first night home after a long vacation and this was it!  I followed some other's tips by adding a can of milk to the mixture before putting in the oven, adding a thawed veggie mix, stiring half way through and adding a light spinkle of cheese to the top just before coming out.  It was s good I have added this recipe to my Recipe Box for easy access.  Husband loved it too and I still felt like it was a more healthy comfort food.

My family loved this dish. If you have ever had chicken-n-rice soup it is just like that but with ground beef. Absolutely perfect for a simi large family.

Good classic comfort food. Don’t expect anything else and you’ll be satisfied. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire, 1 1/2c water so that I could use 3/4c non instant white rice. Baked for 45m at 350.

Very good, quick, tasty recipe. After I put the browned  meat in casserole I mixed soup and rice together and put it in pan I cooked the meat in. Stirred and brought it to a boil. Added to meat in casserole and covered with lid. Heated 30 minutes in oven. No dry, hard rice. Hubby had second helping so will make again.

It was fine, but I won't make it again. I added 1.5 cups of cheese & some corn to help it along. I took note of other reviewers commenting of how it could be dry & added a bit of half & half. Using an 18 oz. can of chicken noodle soup also helped. To avoid the possibility of hard rice, I put this together the night before, giving it a head start. I used a 9x9 pan which was more than large enough.

My son loved this recipe and didn't even notice the chicken noodle soup in it.  In lieu of using the oven, I cooked this casserole on the stove top with a lid on it which helped to melt a sprinkling of cheese I'd added.  This is a family favorite!

I make this recipe all the time...very simple to make, and very delicious!  I think it is a must to add the cheddar cheese soup.  If you don't have a can of chicken noodle around, just add a cup of chicken broth.

Kids LOVED this! Which is hard because they don't love anything. I am not a huge hamburg fan but it was good. I too added a half can of milk to the mixture. I also added pasta to it to make it go further. I put a half cup of mozzarella cheese and a half cup of shredded American on the top.  I covered this with tin foil to avoid the hard rice issue. I also cooked it on 450 as the tinfoil protected it and because i precooked everything I only heated in the oven until it bubbled maybe 15-20 minutes.

I bought a few cans of chicken noodle soup when I had the flu a few weeks ago and searched for something to make with the cans I didn't use.  This was super simple and very good.  Next time I may add a little cheese on top.

This turned out so good! And i ate it for lunch the next day. Even better! I didnt add onions just because i dont like them. And i did cook my instant rice fully before baking. Very very tasty!
