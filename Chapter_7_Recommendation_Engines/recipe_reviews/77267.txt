Absolutely delicious! This will be a new favorite! We served it with vanilla bean ice cream. Glad you "accidently" discovered it.

This pie was fun and tasted even better than Pecan Pie.  I like the top layer that melts in your mouth. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving instead of Pecan Pie. My husband loved it too.

This is a wonderful pie.  I baked it for company and they loved it.  I made an adjustment to the 1.5 cups of sugar.  I changed it to .5 cup of brown sugar, .5 cup of maple sugar, and .25 cup of white sugar.  The resulting pie was very similar to a rich pecan pie.

Very very rich! One thin slice was just enough to satisfy my sweet cravings. This type of pie didn't work out for the rest of the family. Even when taming it down with vanilla icecream, my husband couldn't get passed the potency of the eggy taste.

Absolutely wonderful! I used nut topping instead of pecan, and added strawberries. That gave it a fresh, sweet flavor to offset the richness. It's disappearing fast!

It is very sweet and rich.  I recommend eating it with a large glass of milk or whip cream.
