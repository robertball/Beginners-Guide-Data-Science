Edited 11/23/12 - 24 hours after baking, family said this recipe to be a winner. Did not think so, however, an hour after baking. Original comment dated 11/21/12 - I was really hoping to take a sweet treat to Thanksgiving family dinner, but it is almost tasteless. Might taste better after sitting out all night. Did not tweak recipe; followed it as written. First batter was more like cookie dough. It did not pour out of bowl. Had to spoon out with spatula and spread on bottom of 9x13 inch non-stick metal pan. Baked at 350 degrees F. First layer definitely needs more baking time; didn't add it, though. Figured the next layer would bake bottom layer as well, even after adding 10 minutes then 5. It didn't solidify like cake. Dared not leave in longer as top layer started cracking. Taste-test was disappointing. Could be my spices were not fresh enough.

Just made this one and it turned out pretty good.  I cooked it in a 9x13 pyrex dish at 375* for about 45 minutes, and still feel like the bottom half could have been cooked longer.  I'll definitely be leaving that half in the oven for at least 10 minutes before adding the top portion.  Lastly, felt like there was too much butter in the bottom half.  I will try it with 3/4 cup next time.

This turned out like pumpkin pie filing on a short bread or cookie crust.  I baked it in a 9x13 stoneware pan.  The knife didn't come out clean at thirty five minutes for me, so another fifteen minutes and it was fine.  Personally I liked this at room temp (like pumpkin pie) rather than warm out of the oven..  It was yummy.

I added ginger to the bottom layer. Ran out of baking powder subd. cream of tarter and baking soda. Ran out of eggs and subd. a tabls. of mayo. Used 1/2 c. of butter instead of full cup on the top part. Turned out very good with a gingerbread/pumkin taste. Made a cream cheese frosting to go with. Tasted better the following day.

I think it went pretty well.  I modified it a bit, though.  I did not use the cup of melted butter for the pumpkin half.  I also used a premix pumpkin pie can and added some nutmeg, cinnamon, all spice, and clove.  It came out more like a pumpkin bar.  Looks good to me.
