Very good. A bit time consuming as another reviewer stated but the outcome is well worth it.

These were excellent! Cumin is one of my favorite spices and I really liked it in this one. I made both of the recipe submitter broccoli tots recipes and the only change I made was to add bacon to this one as well. I preferred these ones and hubs preferred the Broccoli Bacon Ranch Tots . We both agreed that both were excellent though. Again, the key is in step 4. Get as much moisture out of the broccoli as you possibly can. These are a bit time consuming but well worth it in the end. Excellent recipe!
