I love non-sweet uses for rhubarb! I left out the honey, assuming the dish would be sweet enough with wine and it was. The rhubarb I had was diced and frozen, and when I cooked it it turned to much so it wasn't pieces of rhubarb so much as rhubarb puree stirred into the rice but it still tasted great! I cut back a bit on the cinnamon and kicked up the spice a notch with extra cayenne. Very good recipe. I served it with some simple sauteed meat.

I changed it just a little bit.  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil. I added bacon bits and a bit more soy sauce and honey. I took it to a pot luck where there were a couple of guys that "hated" rhubarb and both of them eat 2 helpings of it and loved  it.

Enjoyed using my rhubarb in a non-dessert.
I had some left over grains and used them instead of rice, tasted great.

Great way to use rhubarb without all the sugar.  I didn't have honey, so I used a homemade plum syrup and it turned out delicious.  I am looking forward to making this with honey the next time.  This was very flavorful with just the right mix if flavors, tangy with a little zip.  We served it with grilled pork chops.  I will definitely make this again.

What a flavorful and delicious twist on rhubarb.  It was nice to not be drenching it in sugar but to use naturally sweet things instead.  This recipe was great.  It just so happened that I had a bunch of leftover wild rice and a bunch of rhubarb.  I even had all the other ingredients (except for white wine which I substituted with apple juice as per the cook's suggestion).
