10.13.19  Four cups of liquid seemed like an awful lot to me, so I did cut that back to 1-1/2 cups each chicken broth and apple cider.  Since fresh herbs are not as potent as dried, I  doubled the amounts of sage and thyme to better infuse those flavors into the chicken and sauce.   I used Honeycrisp apples which held their shape well and crumbled the bacon. (recipe doesn’t tell you what to do with the bacon).  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the pan sauce very, very tasty.

My family found this yummy! I didn’t have sage which I thought I did so I left it out thinking that might make it bland. It was great anyway. I wonder if reviewers who said it was as way too much liquid actually took the time to reduce it as instructed. I did that and the sauce was thickened slightly so that when I added the rest of the liquid and simmered again with the chicken it was the perfect amount. I used half the butter just to reduce the calories and served it with brown rice to soak up a little sauce which made the rice delicious. Defiantly not too much liquid and definitely a keeper. Can’t wait to make it again with the sage. I used thighs as per the recipe but I think it would be just as good with breasts. Thanks!

Sooo good and my kids loved it! However, I tried it with pork chops, thinking it would be good too, but the pork didn’t take on the flavor hardly, so stick with chicken!

I followed directions exactly and I wouldn’t make it again. It wasn’t awful but not great. Chicken was okay but the sauce was odd and was more a soup than sauce

delicious! my family can't have bacon so I left it out but I think it was just as good.  Agree with other reviewers that it was too much liquid and you can cut both in half. to use dries herbs it's about half tsp sage and quarter to half tsp thyme. yummy!

I did not use the sage and thyme, but it was delicious.  My family loved it.  Everything went together well.

The family loved it.  I didn't have fresh spices.  So I converted to 1/2 tsp of ground sage and 1/4 tsp of ground thyme.  ***

Skillet Apple Cider Chicken is delicious. It has just the tart tang I love. It was simple to make although I made a few changes.  
I prefer boneless skinless breasts so I substituted then for thighs. Not having fresh herbs I used dry, doubling the amount.  Steps 2-4 seemed excessively time consuming so I did them simultaneously. I used a few extra skillets, but no big deal.
Four cups of liquid seemed like a lot, but I left it, and got a tasty sauce to pour over brown rice.
Overall I loved it and look forward to making it again.
I also wondered how the recipe would work with pork.

This was great. Had breasts, only, on hand so left some of the bacon grease. ( I would not do that next time. ) Left out the butter (glad I did because of the bacon grease) Basmati rice instead of noodles.

I did use fresh herbs from my garden and they definitely make a difference. This was very aromatic, sweet, salty... just incredibly flavorful all around. Good recipe, thank you.

My family loved it. It is too much liquid. Next time I would use just 1 cup of stock and 1 cup apple cider.
Other reviewer who said this recipe called for waaay too much Apple Cider VINEGAR made a horrible mistake. There is ZERO vinegar in this recipe. If she used AC Vinegar instead of Apple Cider, that would explain alot.

WAY Too much apple cider vinegar in the recipe.  Cut it in half.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.
