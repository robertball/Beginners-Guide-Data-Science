I liked it, just wanted to share a tip about reducing the avocado taste (which is very minimal as is) but its best to get an avocado that is a little bit under ripe but still soft. The riper it is the more the taste will be pronounced.

Loved it. Ratios are really good in this version. 
I Used combo of medjool dates and raw agave instead of sugar to avoid a blood sugar spike :) Also added a splash of Braggs liquid aminos which added depth and salt to enhance the chocolate flavor. Delicious, fast and super healthy! AND no one will know it's dairy-free.

This was a pleasant surprise.  I made half the recipe to try it and only used a scant 1/4 cup of turbando sugar in place of brown.  We all liked it and my skeptic did not believe it contained avocado.  I had never worked with coconut milk before so it was an education all around.  Thanks!

I have a picky toddler who, not surprisingly, much prefers sweets to vegetables!  So I'm always looking for ways to sneak veggies into "special treats".   He gobbled this up and I found myself licking the bowl.   I threw it all in a food processor and substituted whole milk for coconut milk and it turned out great.

This was very well-received and is great for gluten/lactose intolerant people.  Reading the reviews, I can understand how the cocoa might seem a bit much at first, I think the key is to make it several hours ahead so the chocolatey flavour has time to develop.   It's not like the avocado purée is going to go brown from oxidization in this one!

Reading some of the reviews (i.e., too much cocoa), I can only conclude that the end result will be contingent upon the "type" of avocado used... I used the larger, Florida avocados from my back yard (not Hass). My daughter tells me they are sweeter than the Hass; I am not an avocado lover, so I wouldn't know. Cocoa @ 1/2 c. comes out great. I used homemade Kefir instead of coconut milk with 1/4 c. raw honey & just a small amount of brown sugar (1 - 2 tsp. ?); omitted the cinnamon... NO avocado and/or aftertaste - just perfect chocolate pudding!

We make this a lot.  In our house we like it better than chocolate pudding!! There's a lightness to the flavor and mouth feel that is so fresh but still chocolaty and yummy. I add cream cheese sometimes, or dissolved instant coffee. Personally, I didn't like the cinnamon. I thought the flavors fought, so I always leave that out.

This "Chocolate Avocado Pudding" tastes a lot like uncooked (instant) JELLO brand puddings made from powdered mixes that I remember from my childhood (except without the fake chemical aftertaste). It is creamy and delicious. I think that I would be inclined to make this pudding often if I had children to share it with. I also think I could serve it to house guests without them realizing it wasn't a regular dairy-based pudding. Thank you ki8deslr for sharing your recipe!

First of all, full disclosure...I made some adjustments. I generally frown upon reviewing a recipe if you haven't made the recipe exactly as written, but I couldn't help but give a "thumbs up" for this one, for the skeptics :-) First, I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and I didn't have coconut milk, so I used 2% cow's milk. IT WAS FABULOUS! And I am not one who puts apple sauce and black beans in the brownies...I'm a full sugar-full butter baker. But THIS is very comparable to a "real" pudding! I gave only 4 stars because I personally think it's heavy on the sugar as written (and possibly heavy on the vanilla), but the chocolatey flavor and pudding texture is all the way there. I even found that this was rich enough that I ate LESS of it (and was satisfied) than I would have a regular pudding. Well done!

I was surprised this stuff is really good. I didn't put in the cinnamon, and it tasted just like chocolate pudding. Maybe if I ate a whole bowl full I would notice something is different, but Cool Whip would take care of that. I made it for my toddler, but I found myself eating it too. If anything, I may cut back on the cocoa powder just a little and add just a smidge more brown sugar. What a great recipe!

This is so rich and creamy. It was filling and satisfying so that even my chocolate loving, sweet-toothed hubby could not eat more than one serving at a time (and that is saying a lot)! I plan to make this and freeze it as avocado freezes well and the color will not matter.

Absolutely THE richest chocolate pudding I've ever made!
Cannot taste the avocados at all!  Just sweet enough-
I also cut down on the vanilla & added a touch of almond extract!
This dessert was more than the two of us could eat at once, so we do have enough for tomorrow night's dessert as well..
couldn't have been easier!

I absolutely love avocado and this almost seems a shame to do to it, but I was looking for more ways to sneak vegetables into my kids. I'd seen a recipe for chocolate avocado pudding before that used honey. I was happy to find this one as I was low on honey. It was delicious. The two year old gobbled it up. My chocolate loving 4yo didn't eat as much (she'd had a big dinner though, but said she liked it. It is rich. Oddly, I thought it tasted like chocolate banana, I couldn't taste any hint of avocado. I halved the recipe and did not use the cinnamon as it didn't sound good. May try it next time.

Loved it! Finally found a way to get good stuff into my 5yo son! I used cacao powder instead of cocoa powder to boost the nutrition level, and it doesn't affect the taste. I also used Turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar after seeing another user's comment. I'll definitely be making this on a regular basis!

I love this! Kind of a pudding miracle! I did cut back on the cocoa as advised by others and might cut back a little more. It is very rich and chocolatey, which is a good thing, but almost too rich. It occurs to me "large" avocados are not all equal in size, so it may be a proportion of ingredients issue. But I would start by reducing the cocoa a bit. I topped it with whipped cream. Soooo good! Even my 2 year old grandson gobbled it down saying "yummy!"

I agree with another reviewer. Way too much cocoa. I used a high quality dutch process cocoa and the resulting pudding looks almost black and was very intense. Hershey's cocoa might be less intense, since I tend to have to double that up for my dark chocolate cake recipe. Or maybe I should've used 3 avocados. Anyway, it was tasty enough to try again and I'll be playing with the ratios. Also I'll be trying it with my immersion blender. Using the jar blender was annoying with this thick pudding.

I do not like avocado and I've been trying to find creative ways to incorporate it into my diet.  This is it!!!  The only thing I did differently was I used dutch cocoa powder and added 1/2 of an over ripe banana as well as used 2% milk in place of the coconut because I didn't have any on hand.  It turned out great! So creamy and tasty!

I cut down the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup and I got the the right chocolate fudge  flavour I like my chocolate pudding to taste. I think 1/2 cup of cocoa for 2 hass avocados would be too overpowering. I did not like combination of cinnamon and chocolate in this recipe. I did use a pinch of cinnamon the first time  I made this and it just gave the pudding a weird, unwanted spicy kick. I would omit the cinnamon every time I make this. I had a feeling that it would damper the flavour of it and I was right.

First thing, I don't like avocados but I needed to incorporate them into my diet. I used stevia instead of brown sugar. I used 5 avocados and then doubled and a half everything less.  I don't like dark chocolate as much as milk chocolate but this is great!!

WOW!!!!! This is AMAZING. I made a half recipe to see if I liked it. I should have made the full recipe. I tried a 1/4 sugar as another reviewer suggested, but I had to add more. You cannot tell that there is avocado or coconut milk. I licked every single utensil I used. My blender is terrible. I had to pulse, stir during the whole process, but it is well worth it.

I'm not vegan but I am trying to eat some avocado everyday. I usually have it in the morning plain with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lime. When this showed up in my AR mailbox I thought I'd give it a try. I am glad I did! It's not a "roll your eyes " dessert but it did the trick when I wanted a small treat. I would also make this for my vegan friends. I added a 1/4 tsp of salt to follow up the sweet. Thank you for posting it!

I recently had to cut out dairy and have realized that pretty much everything has dairy in it and needed a backup plan for sweets. This is better than any dairy chocolate pudding I've ever had!!! I LOVE this recipe! Thanks so much for posting!

Amazing! smooth, rich and chocolate-y!!
I might consider adding a touch of chili pepper for a little kick and perhaps a touch of sea salt to bring out the sweets a little more!

Love, Love, Love this!!! It is so creamy and the taste balance is perfect - I did not notice any avocado taste. It's super easy to make. Chill for the full 30 minutes or more - it was best after chilled. I served with blueberries and sea salt flakes sprinkled on top - fabulous!!

Yes this a good recipe. I tried it after 30 minutes in fridge and did not like the taste of it. I still had a good amount left so I put it back in the fridge. The next day all the ingredients incorporate very well in the fridge and tastes like a pudding. I used  the full fat coconut milk from the can because you get the coconut cream which is a good addition to the pudding. Add powdered sugar, vanilla to it and put that in the fridge too. I also used coconut sugar in place of brown sugar.

The coco was a little over powering which made the pudding overall bitter. So in order to sweeten it up I mixed together 1/4 cup melted butter and half a cup of confectioner sugar then added that to the avocado mixture which in turn made the pudding sweeter and fluffier. I also substituted coconut milk for almond milk and it tasted great!!

I substituted the brown sugar for monk fruit sugar blend but only used 1/4 cup because I didn’t want the cooling effect. It worked and it was delicious. Of course it would taste better with brown sugar than with a sugar substitute.

For me the 1/2 cup cocoa was too much. Probably due to the fact I did not use sugar. I used stevia as a replacement so it was a healthy alternative.

One child loved it, the other did not.   I don’t have a yearning for chocolate pudding often but I thought this a very good substitute.   I used coconut sugar and unsweetened dark cocoa.   Tasty.  No hint of avocado taste..

It was a little difficult to blend in my Ninja, but eventually it became smooth. We substituted date sugar for the brown sugar. The taste was actually better than the Whole Foods, which we used to get all the time. Thank you for posting this receipt!

I added one more teaspoon of vanilla, just because I really like vanilla, and omg it was amazing!! As someone who isn’t a huge fan of avocados as it is, I loved it. It is even better the next day when it’s had a night to chill in the fridge.

I used 2 large-ish avocados and added 1/4 cup of cocoa to start, along with 1/2 cup maple syrup.  It tasted very “dark” already so I didn’t add the extra cocoa. I did have to add more milk so that it would blend properly but that just made it fluffier so it worked out well! Served it to my kids aged 4-12 and they all loved it and didn’t notice the avocado!

This is my first time making chocolate avocado pudding and I was disappointed (after hearing all the rave about it). I used more cocoa powder than the recipe and could still taste the avocado! Using melted chocolate would help I suppose but even if you get the chocolate right there's still an eggy aftertaste that comes with avocado that I cant get rid.  The texture was creamy though which I enjoyed. I suppose if you're feeding this to a child they'll eat it in a gulp but as for my own consumption, I wouldnt try this recipe again.

I halved the recipe,used coconut cream, switched out the brown sugar forLakanto Monk fruit sweetener and omitted the cinnamon. It was surprisingly good. My wife noted that it could have been sweeter but overall, it came out good. The texture and consistency was spot on. Thank you for sharing

I don’t care for avacados,  but I purchased  them intending to make guacamole for guests.  Plans changed, but I didn’t want  to waste them. This recipe is delicious. I used previously reviewed  1/4 honey and almond milk and a tablespoon of brown sugar. Omitted the cinnamon too. Delish!

This recipe has tons of potential, but they didn't get the taste right. You cannot taste the avocado and it is incredibly smooth.
So reduce the chocolate powder to 1/3. don't use vanilla at all.
It tastes terrible like alcohol.Add a pinch of salt. It also lasts very well in the refrigerator.

I made two batches because I needed 8 servings.  Because the avocados were small, I used four organic avocados for each recipe, otherwise I followed the directions verbatim.  It takes a little longer in the blender to make because it is necessary to scrape down the sides--I made the second batch in the food processor and it was quicker. This is a wonderful smoothe and creamy dessert with an intense chocolate flavor-I used Trader Joe's unsweetened cocoa.

This recipe was super easy but way too rich. I doubled the recipe because I was making a pie with the pudding. Consistency was great. I would use half the amount of cocoa powder next time.. but I will definitely make again. My whole family loved the pie and couldn't believe what it was made of!

As a proclaimed chocoholic this was actually too chocolatey for me. However, i feel it may have been my own error by not finding LARGE avocados. Maybe had i used 2 large ones as the recipe calls for or 4 small ones, that may have subdued the strong chocolate taste. Next time i will gradually add the chocolate powder until its to my liking. Other than that, i tasted no sign of avocado and it definitely had the look/texture of regular chocolate pudding. I will try this again.

Pretty good. Slight avocado taste but hey...it's made with avocado. I had to double the coconut milk to get my blender to mix it. I wound up with a good consistency. I also left out the cinnamon as I wasn't sure about that.

I am not a big avocado nosher, but this piqued my interest. If I was served this already prepared, I would have no idea it was made with avocados. It has a nice creamy chocolate taste. It's not Jello chocolate pudding but it is delicious. I'm going to try it with other kinds of natural sweeteners - like bananas and honey.

This is absolutely amazing. I was actually searching for vegan pudding recipes to provide healthier snack options for my grandmother, and this did the trick! 

The taste is incredible. You can't even tell it's made with avocado (a major plus, concealing the green stuff from Granny), and it has a thick and smooth consistency. 

It was a tad bit too sweet, so I just lessened the Cocoa Powder and Brown Sugar slightly in the second batch. Perfection.

The avocado adds the perfect naturally creamy texture to the pudding. It is amazing. Due to the limited capacity of my blender I had to use all the can of coconut milk so that it wouldn't be too challenged. The result was still delicious.
What a great way to prepare vegan chocolate pudding!
Thank you!

First of all, OMG coconut cream?!  I didn't know this existed until now, but if you're like me, when it comes to desserts the creamier the better!  It ended up being a good choice; I loved the texture, which is so important for me.  Plus, I think the nutty flavor is stronger in coconut cream which I think helped eliminate the avacado taste.  I went with peoples' suggestion to start out with 1/4 cup of cocoa powder (not Dutch) but it was definitely not enough for my taste!  I ended up putting a lot more in and I still think it could be more chocolatey, but maybe that's the issue with using the cream instead of the milk...I think I will try Dutch cocoa next time.I used two barley ripe medium-

This was excellent! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I reduced the cocoa powder to one-third cup and left out the cinnamon. You have to wait till the next day to eat it. My picky three year old said it was fantastic! She couldn't even tell there was avocado in it! I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

Surprisingly very very yummy. I did cut down on the cocoa powder and added more vanilla. My very picky 1½ year old was ON IT. HE LOVES IT.  Definitely a tasty way to get him more protein. I will definitely be making more.

This is the second time I've made this, substituted almond milk with coconut milk, as I had none on hand. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder. 

Also, I was making it by memory and forget the cinnamon. I like it much better without the cinnamon. I also added a pinch of salt to compliment the dark chocolate.

Loved it! I added an extra avocado and used almond milk, it was all I had at the moment. There's no need for coconut milk (or the fat) for the texture or the creaminess this way! :) I'll make it this way again with... 3 avocados and almond milk.

There was too much cocoa powder for us. We had to add more coconut milk to take out some of the taste. I recommend adding to taste as you make instead. I may make this again but with much less cocoa.

It was interesting. The texture was terrific. I used barely ripe avocados and followed the recipe exactly. I didn't tell my family in advance what the secret ingredient was. I layered it in individual glasses with whipped cream, parfait style. Everyone was excited for dessert! I could still taste the avocado. My three kids and my husband could all tell that something was up and called it "different." My youngest, a chocolate pudding fiend, decided, sadly, that he didn't like it, lamenting, "I guess there's no dessert for me." I'm not sure anyone finished it. Once I fessed up, my oldest called it guacamole pudding. Everyone decided that guacamole is better. I thought it was okay. I think this is a reasonable recipe to try for someone with an avocado tree in the yard who has waaaay more avocados than they can use. Otherwise, make guacamole.

I have made this a couple of times. The first time exactly as printed, hence the 4 stars. Like most reviewers the cocoa was too strong. The second time I reduced the cocoa, and it was just right.  I have also made this pudding, folded in cool whip, and put it in a chocolate oreo crust. That was a huge hit! Next time I will try whipped coconut  cream.

This was great! I was out of Unsweetened Cocoa powder, so I melted a bar of Unsweetened Cocoa instead. I added 30 drops of Vanilla Stevia (and it could have used a lot more, but I didn't want any more vanilla flavor.) Served with whipped cream and it was terrific!

Easy and simple. I used dark chocolate mix by accident and it was a hit. Should add a little more sugar when using DC. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of coconut milk, just out of convienence. Was delicious all the same!

I used avocados that were a bit too ripe which makes them stronger-tasting--that wasn't great but I suspect it will be much better next time. I still like the flavor. I used artificial sweetener and heavy cream to make it low carb. I might use almond flavoring next time and perhaps Pumpkin Pie Spice to change it up a bit. It is amazingly smooth and creamy. I'll be making this on a relatively frequent basis to help curb my sweet tooth. The only down side is when recipes say things like "2 large avocados." What does that mean? Ounces would help somewhat but the size of the pit and thickness of the skin will impact that as well. It's not a huge deal and I'll figure it out by measuring them the next time I make it.

The first few times I made choc avo pudding it turned out tasting way too much like avocadoes. Today I gave it another try using some older avocadoes again, but this time I thought maybe if I added some lemon juice and sea salt it would cut through the old avocado flavor- and it did!! It was so delicious I can't wait too make it again. I did omit the cinnamon and vanilla but I'm sure they'd be great, and I used lakanto and less of it cause I'm trying to eat sugar free. I ate it swirled with some blended frozen berries with a dash of lemon juice-yumyumyum.  One of th efastest  desserts you can make probably.

I love this recipe and I make it all the time. To reduce the calories and sugar content, I cut the Brown sugar and cocoa powder in half and it still tastes amazing. I try to use high quality cocoa like Ghirardelli and I make sure the avocados are ripe.

At first taste, it's chocolatey and good.  The aftertaste is not great because of the heavy cocoa flavor.  That being said, my four year old daughter loves it, though I think it would be better with less cocoa and a bit less sugar.

I used to make this recipe for my family all the time but haven't done it in a while. Decided to revisit it today and it was scrumptious as usual.

This is delicious and if you use cold ingredients (milk, avocado) it’s cold enough to eat right away. Tastes like brownie batter :)

I really like that this was easy to make. My daughter is Autistic and really picky about food so this is a way to get veggies in her diet. The cocoa powder was to strong for my family's taste so I added 1/2c. Of powder sugar and 1/4c.of 2% milk and some whipped topping. I will be making this again  in bigger batches. Even Grandma likes it.

This is very good! My two year old who is very picky loved it. The only change I made was to use regular whole milk instead of the coconut milk. We didn’t have any coconut milk on hand.

This is a great snack when you need a chocolate fix. I did need to add more fluid to get it to fully blend, and even then there were a few small chunks of avocado left. I reduced the brown sugar by about half, which was perfect for me (I prefer dark chocolate, so if you are used to a richer chocolate flavor, reduce the sugar). Not sure how the original recipe states it makes 4 servings unless the servings are super small!

Oh my goodness...this was totally wonderful and *felt* healthy haha. So easy to make and practically does not need to sit...you can serve it immediately. Perfectly creamy, dark chocolate-y, and no one will ever know there is an avocado in it!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dish for my family. I used 3 avocados, 2 bananas (for a creamier texture), maple syrup, cocoa powder, melted chocolate chips (unsweetened), dark chocolate almond milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, pumpkin pie powder, and brown sugar. I also blended in some non-melted chocolate chips to have a crunchy chocolaty surprise. I am really excited for my family to try this - I got whipped cream and strawberries to garnish it. My boyfriend could not believe that there were avocados in it. With the banana, it gives it that chocolate covered banana taste - not too overpowering, but just right.

You have to make it and eat it to believe it! It is unbelievably creamy and very chocolatey. I made it for a teacher luncheon and no one believed me when I told them there was avocado in it. Very good for those on special diets such as lactose or gluten sensitive.

This was awesome. I substituted 3/4 c maple syrup for the sugar and 1/4 c hemp seeds for the milk. Delightful!

I doubled the recipe but used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and added strawberries. Awesome! 

Also used 4 ripe avos. Still awesome!

Wow! We really enjoyed this! I just added a splash more coconut milk to thin it out a tad more.

I read one reviewer said it was too much cocoa powder, so I started with 1/4 c. (half what is called for), because you can always add more, but you can't take it out!  I went ahead and added a spoonful of raw honey and another 1/8 c. cocoa powder (Dutch), and doubled, almost tripled the milk.  Yes, cow milk works fine.  I like it less thick, so the added milk was MUCH better.  The kids love it.  I would make this again if I didn't have fresh bananas on hand for the banana/avocado version.

Turned out lumpy, even after plenty of mixing. Not as chocolaty as I expected. Good, I ate it pretty quickly (portion size, what portion size?) and I'll make it again with a few adjustments.

this is a great recipe to try but I would reduce the amount of sugar and cocoa powder used. I used only 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 1/4 cup of honey but it was super sweet and strong still. Its still very good though!

Awesome! Used organic cocoa powder and agave. You could do a lot of different things with this basic recipe for healthy desserts!

This was so easy!  I realized that I did not have unsweetened cocoa so I used instant hot chocolate and left out the brown sugar.  Tasted wonderful!

I have made this recipe twice and my picky kids have no idea this has avocados in it. This is an excellent dairy free chocolate pudding that is prepared with minimal effort which I LOVE. 1/3 c of cocoa is plenty here. I used coconut sugar the second time I made this instead of regular brown sugar and both variations are delicious. I omitted the cinnamon the second time around and I prefer it that way. I think using just a tiny bit of espresso powder would be good here also.

I will never buy instant chocolate pudding again. This recipe was so easy to make and a lot healthier. After reading other reviews, I put 1/2 the amount of powdered cocoa listed on the recipe (I had dark chocolate) and was happy with the results. I also added a bit more milk to make it less thick and more appealing to my son. He finished his plate in minutes!!

This was very good however I do agree the cocoa amount was overpowering for my family. Super easy, way healthier, overall I'm a fan =)

I’m not a fan of avocado, but we are giving it try. So far it isn’t going well. My son was in another room while I was making this, but he doesn’t like the smell. I’m assuming it is the cocoa powder (a new brand for me). While making it the cocoa was really over powering, but there is a strong taste from the avocado (I’m sampling to get it right). I’ve added more sugar, vanilla, and peanut butter to tone down the avocado taste, but I think it needs something more.
Since the pudding hasn’t past the smell test I don’t think it will past the taste test. Next time I try to make this I will take another reviewers advice and use an under ripe (but still soft) avocado and bananas and my regular brand of cocoa powder. Hopefully I won’t have to tweak the recipe more than that.

I love that this a healthier treat, and I'd make it again. However, my husband and I both think it has a bad after taste. I'm not sure if it was because I just didn't blend it enough or what, but the unsweetened coco power seemed to come out too much. I'll try again, maybe substitute cows milk. My daughter had three big spoonfuls, but then was done, I'm not sure if she didn't like the after taste, she's only two, but I'm thinking that might be the case.

Super easy, had all of the ingredients. Halved the recipe and used almond milk, still delicious- I also don't have a blender so I just mixed it with a spoon no problem! Made it for me and my non-vegan boyfriend and he didn't even notice. I ate a couple spoonfuls before it was even chilled ;)

This was way to chocolaty. Non of my kids liked it. Might try again with less coco and more milk.
