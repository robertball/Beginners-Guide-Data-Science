Loved this drink!  Used Cointreau instead of Triiple Sec and Sprite Zero for the lemon-lime soda.  Did not rim the glasses with salt.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Absolutely phenomenal.  All you could ever want from a margarita recipe and then some.  My husband just returned from a trip to Mexico, and I had to find a recipe that was worthy to use with the bottle of Blanco Patron he brought back.  This most definitely fit the bill.  Thanks!!

This is the best Margarita recipe I have found yet on the Internet and I have tried out and experimented with dozens.  I would call this the  White Margarita had I named it.  My wife thinks of it as a Dry Margarita.  Either way we love it and hardly a weekend goes by that we don't whip up a batch.

I actually multiplied this recipe to make 16 servings and pre-made it in a giant pitcher for a football party, then just poured it into ice filled glasses.   I used Diet 7-Up and frozen limeade concentrate, which I mixed with 4 cans of water before using for the margaritas. It's very refreshing and light, and sure packs a punch!   It makes a strong drink, but that's how I like it! I live in Arizona, so I went to the backyard and pulled limes off my tree and squeezed a fresh lime into each glass, YUM!

A better-than-a-bar margarita and...it has lemon-lime soda in it!  Amazing!  This is one that you have to try!  On the rocks with salt and a slice of lime is the way to go!

Loved it.  I used sprite zero and it came out great, although it was very potent.

Easy, cheap and delicious! For me, I prefer a 1/3 cup of triple sec and 1/3 cup of rose's.

Amazing! Tasted just like our fav marg from the chain restaurant we often visit.  The only thing I did different was add a equal packet to some fresh squeezed lime juice instead of using the sweetend lime juice from the bottle you get at the store.  Seemed kind of silly not to just use fresh.  Very yummy!! We were drinking these all Cinco De Mayo weekend!!!
