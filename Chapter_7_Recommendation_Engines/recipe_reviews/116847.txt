I used cheese and spinach stuffed ravioli and mozzerella cheese and it was fantastic. Can't wait to eat it again!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any seasoning at home, but found a really easy recipe on-line  (1 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. dried mustard, 1 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. dill weed, 2 tsp. paprika).

This recipe is awesome, my boyfriend and I had seconds! I used olive oil instead of the butter, added garlic powder to taste and used Green Giants Immunity Boost veggies (broccoli
, bell peppers, olive oil and herbs).  Will make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe is way too easy not to like!  Tossed the veggies in with the ravioli instead of cooking them a bit first because I think they would have ended up overcooked.  I used lots of veggies: a 12 oz bag of frozen cauliflower, a 12 oz bag of peas and carrots and the last of a bag of corn but would stick to California blend veggies like the recipe says because the tiny cut carrots, peas and corn all kinda sifted to the bottoms of our bowls.  Held off on the parmesan and we grated a little over our individual servings.  I used an altered version of Susanna's seasoning blend and just stirred it all in while the butter melted- 1 t dried mustard, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t oregano, 1/2 t thyme, 1/2 t onion powder, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 t pepper and 1/4 t dill.  The finished dish was very yummy and the seasoning complimented it well.  This was actually the first time my husband has liked cauliflower.  Not something I'd serve for company but good for a throw together dinner with ingredients I always have.

I changed this recipe by sauteing the frozen vegs in garlic and butter, and S&P in a separate skillet. I then add creamer and cornstarch to create an alfredo sauce that I spooned over the ravioli( i even used tofu ravioli, soy creamer and soy butter to make this a dairy free.) My kids loved it! And it was quick!

Great little easy dish!! Loved the frozen veggies part.  I was skeptical at first but they were great!  I would sautee the veggies first though and I added a little garlic salt and pepper.

Great for when you need a fast dinner!

We thought this was pretty good.  My kids (3 & 5) really like broccoli so that was the only veggie I used.  I didn't use butter or the seasoning blend either becasue of the other reviews saying it was bland.  I used a very small amount of balsamic & basil oil which worked very well and gave it GREAT flavoring.  I do not recommend using one veggie - the broccoli flavor was strong!  Next time I'll be useing the California Mix!

I was expecting more from the reviews... Quick and easy, but boring. I guess when I see lots of stars I think it'll be amazing to eat, not just easy to throw together.

Interesting concept, but not really good as written.  I followed the recipe to the T (something I rarely do), and was really disappointed.  I think the veggies sauteed would be better and I agree that a sauce of some kind would help meld the two frozen products.  I'll attempt again, but with major alterations.  Thanks for the idea!

Surprisingly yummy! Even my meat-eating husband liked it. I used susanna614's recipe for seasoning and also added a little tomato/garlic bread dipping seasoning I had on hand. This was great for using the cheese tortellini (not ravioli, but close enough) I had in the fridge. I didn't have any sauce, but the butter/cheese/seasoning mixture was "light" and perfect! Also got to use that bag of frozen veggies I'd had for awhile. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was perfect for me! It was fast, healthy and delicious. My husband didn't even notice that there wasn't any meat in it. We had enough to be full and still had some leftovers.

Not bad for how easy it is to make!  I used EVOO instead of the butter but followed the rest.

This is a basis for a really simple and good meal that you can dress up in different ways. Thanks to this recipe, I developed a ravioli/veggie dish that's so super simple and tastes great! It's almost the same as this one, but even easier. All I do is cook a package of frozen ravioli, and then heat up 2 packages of Green Giant Simply Steam Baby Vegetable Medley. The veggies have their own subtle sauce, so I simply mix the 2 packges with the ravioli, and that's it! One of the easier meals I make, and it's really satisfying!

This is really good. I used Bertoli's multi-colored cheese stuffed ravioli (my store is famous for always being out of what I need to cook for the night) and omitted the seasoning packet plus the cheese+tomatoes it comes with and just used the pasta (it was oven bake on package and I needed to cook the pasta in water on the stove to match up to the rest of the recipe) (used it for another recipe later on) I seasoned the pasta with garlic powder and pepper and a healthy amount of parmesean. I will definitely make this again.

A wonderful, easy recipe for a busy week night.  I took the advice of others and added garlic and minced onions to the boiling water to add a little extra flavor.  The vegetarians in the family loved it, and so did the rest of us.
