The casserole was good; however, the directions don't indicate that the pan needs to be sprayed before putting the bread in the dish.  Also, I used more eggs and cheese then what was indicated which made it a little better.

This was easy and tasted good. We will make it again, but may add ham or sausage to it as well or try throwing in some bell pepper in addition to the onion. Overall, we liked it and will make it again.

Excellent.  My guests loved it. Used 8 eggs and 2 1/4 c milk. Made it the night before and baked next morning.

Quite good. I will make this again. When making it, I suspected there wasn't enough liquid but I like to follow the recipe the first time. It was fine. I did cut the bread a bit smaller than suggested.  :-)
