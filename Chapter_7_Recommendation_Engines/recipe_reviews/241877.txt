I make this all the time, with a few changes so it takes less than 5 minutes to make and becomes more peanut butter freezer fudge than peanut butter cups: I combine everything together, using slightly less than 1/4 c coconut oil (leave out the extra tbsps oil.. Stevia isn't necessary, nor is the extra tbsp pb.) Mix everything together and freeze.  Thanks very much for this recipe. I make this constantly! It's my favorite dessert and I often eat a piece for breakfast.

I swapped the peanut butter for the hazelnut spread, then used chocolate peanut butter in place of the hazelnut spread (it's what I had on hand). I also ground raw organic cocoa nibs in place of the cocoa and ommited the stevia. Since I didn't have muffin pans at my cottage, I tripled the batch and chilled the bottom layer in a 13x9 casserole dish before adding the top layer, re-chilling and cutting into pb "fudge". My kids and I had a blast licking all the bowls and spoons! Update: after layering and chilling this recipe, I realized that if you mix all ingredients and chill- this turns into the EASIEST, yummiest, totally VEGAN, peanut butter cup fudge.
