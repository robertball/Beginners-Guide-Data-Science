Awesome. When I have time I boil a couple of the cups of water together with the sugar. It dissolves the sugar for no grainy taste. I bought a Krups juicer just to make lemonade. Makes this a breeze. Thanks :)

EXTREMELY simple. Was able to whip some up in about 5 minutes. I put the lemons in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds to warm them up a bit. I then used a glass juicer to squeeze the juice out (bought the juicer at Walmart for about $3 or $4). My 4 year old said it was "mmmmmmmmm". Followed the recipe exactly. Thanks Erin for the great recipe!

I thought this was very good and it beats the store bought kind by a mile!!!  I did think it was slightly too sweet, but that is very easily modified.  I will definitely make this again!!

This lemonade was simply delicious. Sometimes the basics really are the best. I used an electric juicer, and it really speeded up the process, and also gave me about 1.5 cups of lemon juice (I still used 1 cup for the recipe). Before I added the sugar, I melted it with a little bit of water in a pot to form a syrup so it wouldn't be so gritty in the lemonade. It worked. A fantastic recipe!

Great, straight forward recipe. I don't have a juicer so I peeled the lemons and used my hand blender to puree. Then I strained the juice and used Splenda in place of the sugar. Nice blend of sweet and tart. Delicious!

I did not think this was as good as everyone makes it out to be.  The six lemons made about a cup of lemon juice but I dont think that was enough.  The drink was very bland and boring.  I like lemonade to have more "life", more body.  This just tasted like sweetened lemon water, (yes, i know thats what lemonade is)but it was far from good.  My four year old daughter loved it, but then again, she loves anything she helps make.  Next time i will try another recipe.  I hope to have more luck.

I did it in a slightly different order. I boiled two cups of water and added the sugar to dissolve it. Then I added that mix to two cups ice in the pitcher. Finally I added the last two cups of cold water and the one cup lemon- stir and over ice it's perfect!

Perfect Lemonaid. I use Baker's Sugar. It's much finer and mixes easier & quicker than granulated (measures identical to regular sugar too).

I made this with just a little less sugar(1/8 of a cup less) and it came out just how I like it. I heated the lemon juice, sugar, and one cup of water on the stove until the sugar dissolved, then added it to the other five cups of water. Thanks for a great lemonade recipe- I will be using it very often!

Sweet and simple recipe.  A bit too sweet for me, but hey, that's what lemonade is all about, right?
I also added a little bit of bottled lemon juice.  I would make it again.

I used the bagged lemons from Costco which are really big so the lemonade may have been a little more tart than if using smaller lemons but I made it as directed.  I used warm lemons so they were juicer and used a hand reamer to get all the juice out.  I then strained it before adding the sugar.  Very good!!

I gave this recipe a 5 because it was soo simple and very enjoyable. I admit to being a VERY impatient person, and I wanted to make lemonade without having to boil sugar and water and cooling...So I saw this recipe and made it right away. Its great!!! I added half a lemon more just to have a little more of a tart taste. Fantastic! If you use already refrigerated water its ready to drink in seconds. YUMM! My 2 youngest kids 4 and 2 enjoyed this as welll...(i made sure not to make it TOO tart) :)

I chose this recipe because it didn't require making a syrup.  Simple, straightforward, took 2 minutes to make using bottled lemon juice.  In the end, I had to add an extra squirt of lemon juice because it seemed just a little too watery and I like my lemonade a bit tarter.

This lemonade was too sugary and didn't have enough lemon. Bottom line- too sugary not enough flavor.

Good, standard lemonade.  Not too sweet, a little on the tart side.

Good recipe - I'd use less sugar next time though, maybe 2/3 to 3/4 a cup in total :)

Very good basic lemonade. I did make one minor change. I dissolved the sugar in 1c. water on the stove, let it cool & added to the remaining 5 cups of water, lemon juice & ice in a pitcher. Easy as can be and really refreshing on a hot day.

Fresh-squeezed lemonade is pretty simple - lemon juice, sugar, water. It was the proportions I was looking for and while this was just right for me it can be easily adjusted to suit individual tastes. My electric juicer made quick work of this!

I used half a cup of Truvia baking blend instead of 1 cup of sugar and I was surprised it tastes really good not like Splenda or any artifficial sweetner . I also liked that Truvia dissolves in the water very fast not like the regular sugar

Very good...but I do recommend boiling the water and sugar together so it blends and sweetens more and it dissolves the sugar better. This makes for some good lemonade.

Been searching for an easy lemonade recipe for company, I truly feel I've found perfect recipe, best thing both sweetness or tarness are easily adjusted. Serving Green chili chicken Enchiladas, Spanish rice & Homeade Flan. Allrecipes is the best for any recipe.

Very simple.  Quick and easy to make.  I used my SodaStream home soda machine to lightly carbonate it, and it came out wonderful.  Next time I'm going to try fermenting it with brewer's yeast for a few days to get a natural carbonation.  Heck, I might even try to fully ferment a batch for some hard lemonade.

Loved this!  Kids had a lot of fun watching me make it.  I did use less sugar.  I thought 3/4 cup sugar was plenty sweet.  Tasted just like the lemonade mix from the store, but with much better health benefits.

Here's a tip, make a double batch because you're going to want more! I cut the sugar in half and used splenda for the rest. I also dissolved the sugar in some boiling water so it wouldn't settle out. Just perfect for a hot summer afternoon!

Another data point in the "simple is best" set! The balance of tart:sweet:strength is sure to appeal to most, and the recipe is easy to adjust. After I'd made this a few times, I added 1 tsp. zest to the lemonade - that kicked it!

This recipe only makes like 1/2 galloon and it takes more lemons than the recipe calls for.  I used 8 lemons, 8 cups water, and about 1 1/2 cups sugar.  It is something you need to have extra supplies on hand.  My family loved this.  It is very refreshing!

So easy and good! The proportions were just right. For those who like a bit of zing, use less sugar. I had a juicer, which made it SO EASY. (-: Thank you for the recipe!!

Loved this on Memorial Day! I added less water and sugar because we prefer a tart lemonade. The adults enjoyed it with a splash (or two haha) of vodka before dinner.

This was very refreshing and tasty. I used lemon juice instead of fresh lemons, and added about half a bag of frozen strawberries to make strawberry lemonade. Next time I would probably cut down on the sugar, but I'll probably be making this a lot during the summer!

This was the first time I had tried making homemade lemonade- and definitely not the last! I used a trick my mother showed me, which is to roll the lemons very firmly and then poke several holes in each lemon with a knife. After, put them in the microwave for 1 minute, pausing and then restarting after 30 seconds. It takes a little more time, but I ended up using 4 lemons and got a cup of juice!

Also another good idea is to add some of the pulp after juicing the lemons, giving it a better, fresher flavor. And I replaced one cup of water with 2 cups ice.

This was so easy and tasty. I used bottled lemon juice instead, which is probably easier (but it's probably less healthy.) Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make and fun for the kids.  They helped to squeeze the lemons by hand since we do not have a juicer.

Great thanks.  I used small lemons because that is all the store had.  It came out to about a 3/4 cup of juice.  My whole apartment smelled like lemons while they were being squeezed.  Not too tart, not super sweet. Just right.

If you want to add a twist to your lemonade, mince up some fresh basil and toss it in! It didn't overpower the lemonade at all, but added some extra flavor to compliment the lemon!

A little work but SO worth it!  My kids knew it was fresh squeezed and not the recipe I make using Real-Lemon concentrate!  Dang! ;)***update** family loves this so much we bought a little juicer machine to make it easier!  Now it is easy to whip up a pitcher anytime! ***Made recipe again only with lime this time.  Just as delicious :)

Great recipe!  I made one addition - after mixing everything together, I also added the juice from one grapefruit (about 1/2 cup).  It adds a bit more flavour - delicious!

I used 6 large lemons which yielded 2 cups of lemon juice. I simmered 2 of the 6 cups of water and added 1 cup of sugar to dissolve it. I found the recipe as listed a bit watered down for my taste. I like my lemonade slightly tart so I added two more lemons (another half cup of juice) and it came out perfect.

Awesome.. didnt need tweeking at all!  But after the first batch was gone.. I put some strawberry Daquri Mix in it.. and then cut up some fresh strawberries and threw in it.. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  We never buy the frozen stuff.. yeah.. this is a bit more expensive.. but tastes wayyyy better!  When we are in a pinch we use lemon juice in a jar.. we also have replaced lemons with Lime Juice!  Very tasty!

Just perfect!  I had some lemons in my fridge and ended up only needing four for a cup of lemon juice.  But this was really really fast and simple to prepare.  I'd been looking for a lemonade recipe for a while now.  This is wonderful.  Super tasty and refreshing. Thank you.

Loved this recipe! I did mix the sugar and 1 1/2cups water in a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Other than that, didn't change anything! I think I might add a few Kiwi slices for decoration and to vary up the flavors. Fabulous recipe for a lemonade base if you want to make multiple flavored lemonades!

Oh, YUM.  First time I made this I didn't have a pitcher, so I just reduced the serving to 1 and it was EXCELLENT.  I thought the balance of tart and sweet was perfect...but then I do have a bit of a sweet tooth when it comes to drinks. It just didn't taste overly sweet to me. Yum yum yum, I'm going to go make some more right now!

I love this recipe!!  I know the 'Best Lemonade Ever' has more positive reviews, and it is a fabulous recipe, but it just takes so long!  I seem to get cravings for lemonade at the spur of the moment, and I want it right that second.  This is the recipe for me!  I make it in under a minute, shake it to help the sugar dissolve quickly, and drink nearly the entire thing almost immediately! :)

Thanks, Erin, for a super recipe.  I usually use Minute Maid frozen but this was not only better, but better for you.  I dissolved the sugar in a half cup of the water but it probably wasn't necessary as long as it sits for a while.  Perfect proportions.  My friends and I loved it and it will become a favorite.

I don't get it! I love lemonade, but there was absolutely no flavor in this. I did like that it was not oozing with sugar like most recipes, but it still didn't work for me. Not disgusting or anything, just BLAH.

lemon lovers-this was great.
best advice ever is to firmly roll the lemons before you cut and juice them. that really got the lemons to give juice.
thanks for the recipe.

This is the lemonade recipe I use.  But I boil the water and steep the lemons (halved) and sugar in the water until the water is room temp. Then I juice the lemons into the sugar water and chill.  I love this recipe! Thanks for publishing!

Yum. This is GOOD lemonade. I juiced the lemons by hand with a 3 inch strainer over my pitcher to catch the seeds.   After I mixed all the ingredients together I added the squeezed lemons and filled my pitcher up with ice. This was so good and so easy to make. Thanks.
 
Edit: I have started making strawberry lemonade with this recipe also. I use 1/2 package dole sliced frozen strawberries. In a bowl pour 1/4 c sugar over them. I let them set while I make the original recipe, then mix them in at the end. Yum yum yum.

We made this using 3/4 cups brown sugar instead of white sugar, and heated the sugar with one cup of water before adding the lemon juice and ice water to it. It had a different flavor than normal because of the brown sugar (as well as a different color), but was great.

I had tree removers working on a hot day and made it for them.  To save time I used lemon juice instead of fresh lemons. They all loved it and I did too.

Mmm! This lemonade is so refreshing! I changed it to 3 servings because I only had 3 lemons. Still made a whole small pitcher enough for dinner tonight! Also, out of the 3 cups of water I needed, 1/2 of it was hot water which I dissolved the sugar in. It gives it a nice smooth texture. It is more tart than most lemonades. When I first tasted it, it was tarter than expected but it's really nice! Try it, it's delicious!

Totally easy, totally delicious!  I did heat my water and sugar on the stove while I squeezed my lemons.  My kids helped squish the lemons by rolling them on them on the table for me.  Next time, we'll add some mint sprigs to the finished pitcher!

Wonderful and refreshing! I juiced 8 lemons because that was what I had and I boiled the sugar with 2 cups of water to make a syrup. Big thumbs up on this one! The tip about microwaving the lemons for 10-15 seconds was a gem!

Nice to not have to boil and wait for it to cool.  If you have a kitchen aide stand mixer w/ a juicer adapter it makes it so much easier to juice.

This was by far the best lemonade recipe ever!  I hand squeezed mine and only had to use 5 lemons.  The rolling of the lemons was a great tip as it helped me squeeze the juice much faster.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was very good. I didn't have a juicer so I decided to take lemon juice in a bottle that you use for cooking. I used 1 cup of this and increased the water to 7 cups and 1 cup of sugar. I added LOTS of ice. Was wonderful!

YUM!!! This is what I've been looking for. An old fashioned recipe with no corn syrup, aspartame, etc. I actually upped it to 8 lemons with 7 cups of water and 1 cup sugar. I like mine sour :) The tip to microwave them after rolling them on the counter was great. Nothing tops homemade lemonade.

Yum! I used this to make limeade and it came out great. Six limes got me ~1 cup juice, and 24 Splenda packets  equals 1 cup of sugar. Turned out great.

I think you mean to say a Half Gallon container. A gallon is 16 cups: a half gallon is 8 cups. 1 cup sugar and 1 cup lemon juice plus 6 cups of water will be just over 7  cups, leaving around a cup for ice, and fit very nicely in a half gallon. I made it in a gallon pitcher, which was very difficult to find and buy, and it looked so empty I thought you must mean to add a half gallon of ice, but the lemonade got very waterey and weak. Next time I made it in a half gallon pitcher, which most pitchers are so it was easy to find one, and just poured it straight over a glass of ice and it was great! I think you made a mistake telling us to make it in a gallon container and you should change the instruction to making it in a half gallon container.

Great standard lemonade, calling for equal measure of lemon juice and sugar. For those who read only the ingredient list, the recipe actually does call for one cup of juice to the cup of sugar. Although I like mine a touch less sweet, it is probably a five for most lemonade lovers. If you like extra tart, hold back on some of sugar and give it a taste, then add to your liking.

Nice recipe, but , that's a lot of sugar! I started with half of the given amount (because I already knew I find the 'typical'  American lemonade way too sweet), and already thought it was pretty sugary, almost too sweet for me! But hey then, I'm European :P Am enjoying my lemonade now, though!

Refreshing & easy! I peeled the lemons and added a handful of raspberries to the juicer and then followed the rest of the recipe. We were left with a delicious & pink raspberry lemonade.

This is probably the best lemonade I have ever had!  My young son also loves using this recipe when he does his outdoor lemonade stands and his customers also love it!  It's great to even add some raspberries or strawberries to it...  LOVE IT.

I had a sudden craving for lemonade after a friend asked to borrow a lemon for a recipe she was making. I had been cleaning the garage on a hot day. I didn't want to wait hours for my drink and only had two Meyer lemons, which meant I had to cut the recipe by a third. So this is how I made two glasses of lemonade in about 5 minutes. (One for my husband laboring in the veggie garden.)

I used an electric juicer and juiced 2 Meyer lemons. I combined the lemon juice with a bit less than two ounces Sun Crystals All Natural Sweetener in a microwave safe measuring cup and nuked it for 30 seconds. This made a nice syrup and dissolved the sweetener.  (I only had the Sun Crystals and Organic Pure Cane Sugar on hand, but no white sugar, so gave it a try.)
 
Next, I combined ice cubes and water to make 2 cups cold water in a container. Then poured in the lemon syrup. Shook it up, and wallah! I had two cold glasses of lemonade. It was perfect!

Of course, if you want the amount in the recipe, use the quantities suggested.

I love lemonade and this recipe was a simple, yet satisfying, one to follow.  I, like many others, created a simple syrup with the sugar and water and then added that, although I tweaked it a bit further, for no particular reason other than that I love experimenting with things, and added an orange.  Then since oranges are sweet, I only added 1/2 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup.  I like my lemonade a bit tart so it turned out perfectly for me!  Over-all, a great recipe!

My first attempt at making lemonade and it is delicious. No more shop bought for me :-)I had 1 1/2 cups of fresh lemon juice so just increased the sugar only slightly, taking into account other comments on it being too sweet. Thank you!

Very good and simple to make.  Six lemons gave me a few Tablespoons more than a cup.  I used 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar.  I don't see why these people who say it's not potent enough can't just add another lemon (duh!) or a cup less of water.

I give it 5 stars because you can make it sweet or tart just by adding more lemons or less. It is quick and fast a great basic lemonade drink.

I only had 5 lemons, but they were pretty big. I started out using the same amount of sugar and water, but it ended up being too sour so I just added a quarter cup more sugar and added water until it tasted alright. It's a good recipe for a starting point but honestly "6 lemons" is just a bit too vague.

This is great stuff.  I needed fresh lemonade for some "adult" infusions, and this did the job.  It also tastes great on its own.  Like other reviewers, I boiled some water and sugar to keep the texture smooth.  The tip to the roll the lemons first was also fantastic!

This recipe is easy to make and the taste is  perfectly balanced.  Sometimes I substitute Seltzer Water or Club Soda for the water called for in the recipe and it adds a nice kick .  Great either way!

So refreshing and easy to make, I like to put in the pulp from the lemons also. Great for sipping on these hot summer days in a tall glass with lots of ice.

I must say, this is the BEST lemonade, ever. It's truly the perfect combination of tart and sweet. The only thing I did differently was I microwaved 1 cup of the water to dissolve the sugar in. You can't go wrong with this recipe! An amazingly refreshing summer treat! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This was excellent.  I did have to use a few extra lemons to make a cup of lemon juice, but it was ok as I had a big bag of lemons that I needed to use up anyway.  It was delicious.

This worked out perfectly for me. I had a few minutes while waiting for my rolls to finish cooking and thought I'd make this. Made exact and then tried it. This lemonade is a little bit on the sweeter side, so I added another lemon. 

Tastes great. Will be even better mid-day when temperatures soar.

Very lemoney! If you like tart lemonade, this is the one for you. I only had 4 lemons, so I scaled the recipe to 4 lemons (2/3 c. lemon juice), 2/3 c. sugar and 3 cups of water. When I drank it, I put some in a glass and added seltzer water to get the taste I preferred. If you prefer not to do that, then add 4 cups of water rather than 3.

This is agreat recipe for Lemonade.  Good combo of sweet and tart.  I used 3 cups warm tap water to disolve the sugar first, then added 3 cups of cold water to make the 6 cups total.  Now, I have to make more for my picnic because I drank it all last night !!!

I thought it came out a bit too sweet.  Try it with 3/4 cup of sugar first, and add more a little at a time if desired.

This was very good lemonade.  It wasn't too sweet and was easy to make.  I did make a syrup dissolving all of the sugar and 1/2 of the water on the stove. Then I cooled it a bit, added the lemon juice, and the rest of the water.  I'm about to make it again today.  Thanks for the recipe.

We had a dinner party with friends and I served this along with the Bodacious Broccoli Salad, Dave's Low Country Boil, Tartar Sauce I, Summer Potato Salad from this site, my own homemade cocktail sauce, lots of melted butter, french bread and lots of beer.  Then we proceeded to celebrate and immediately fall into a food coma, followed by a movie at the beach.  Summer Perfection! Note that each of these recipes have lemon in them, which screams Summer and ties all the recipes together.

This is the best lemonade I have ever had.  I ran out of lemons before I had 1 full cup, so I juiced an orange as well.  I cut back the sugar to 2/3 cup.  Wonderful flavor and beautiful color.

Very good! I did a few things different....I boiled a little less than 1 cup of water with the sugar before I added it, and I also added some frozen strawberry's. Next time I may use a little less sugar because the the strawberry's were in a syrup, but it was still delicious!

FANTASTIC.  I used the idea of heating 1 cup of water with the sugar.  I used 4 cups of regular water and the remaining cup was ice cubes.  I also put in slices of lemon.  

Thank you for the recipe.

This lemonade is perfection in a glass! I made the recipe as stated to begin with (needed 7 lemons because they were smaller seedless ones, but still used 1C juice). Then wound up doubling it because I had the extra lemons and wanted about 1/2 gallon.

I will note that it does need to be chilled overnight for the best flavor. But wow is that refreshing! Just shake it up really good before serving. No issues with gritty sugar texture as I noticed in a cooler other reviews.

Husband loves lemonade. He likes his more on the tart side. This is a great base recipe. We use less sugar and more lemon juice to get it exactly where he likes it. Always boil the sugar and a cup of water to dissolve sugar. Then add in remaining water. When trying to please the masses we make the recipe as is and it’s always a hit.

We loved this lemonade. We have a Meyer lemon tree in our yard, so we were looking for ways to use the lemons, and this recipe was so easy. Our six lemons gave a little more than the cup of juice required, but we just used it all since this variety isn't as tart as some others. We served it over crushed ice - great and easy; we would definitely make this one again. Very happy not to have to boil anything or make a simple syrup like other recipes require.

It was a hit in my house! Perfect balance. I used more than 6 lemons, but just made sure I had one cup of lemon juice. My lemons were fairly small which may be why I needed more. But everything was perfect!

I love this recipe. My 3 year old helped me make it and was so excited. I only used 4 lemons because it measured out to 1 cup. I boiled 2 cups of water to dissolve 3/4 cup of sugar. Then put ice and water, followed by the lemon juice. Even though I modified it for my family I still give it 5 stars.

Delicious.  I squeezed the lemons by hand and had  1 1/2 cups of juice, so it was perfect.  Great way to use up the extra lemons I purchased while they were on sale.  Am going to try using Stevia instead of sugar next time.  Delicious, thank you for sharing!

This was delicious.  My fiance gave me lemons for lemonade, but the recipe was quite complicated. This was delicious and perfectly tart.  I enjoyed it so much... wishing for more fresh lemons now :)

I only used half a cup of sugar which I think worked really well for me ^.^ It tastes so good and I have tons left over. I juiced the lemons by hand using a fork and strained the juices probably three times to ensure there wasn't too much pulp. 100% will make this again.

It would be helpful to put the number of ounces, cups, or whatever when writing a recipe that is all about balance. 6 lemons -( huge ones, big ones, medium, small, tiny?) Is too broad for me. Size is subjective and amount of juice in one lemon could be 1/4 the amount of another. I ended up with sour sour lemonade. Added sugar, then water but it never was just right.... Ratios Ratios Ratios! (Like location in real estate, LOL!)

Delicious. We have Meyer lemons, so adjusted a bit because they are sweeter than yellow varieties. But very tasty. Takes my usual guesswork out of lemonade. Thanks!

I had 7 lemons left over from a camping trip, i decided to look online for a simple recipe and came across this one. The only thing I did differently was that I used 7 lemons instead of six. Other than that I followed the recipe. I am very pleased..... so delicious!! Perfect. Will use this recipe from now on. Taste just like the lemonade at the fair, everyone loved it.

A simple and delicious recipe.   Good advice to roll the lemons on the counter.  I followed advice from a previous reviewer and boiled the sugar in one cup of water in the microwave to eliminate grittiness.  I put the pulp from the lemons into the pitcher.  Only needed 4 lemons to get one cup of juice but used 5 for extra flavour.  I sliced up the sixth one and put slices on a wooden skewer in the pitcher.  Thank you for this recipe.

It's Good! Microwaved six large lemons for 30 seconds. Perfect, they almost juiced themselves :-). Six cups cold purified water, 1/2 c Florida Crystals Cane Sugar which I added water and microwaved for 30 seconds for syrup. Perfect, again. Mixed together and poured over ice (I couldn't wait for the chill) and I love it; so does my fam. Another keeper. Reminds me of my Mom's lemonade. Not too tart, not too sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and delicious. I only had 5 lemons on hand so used a bit of bottled lemon juice to make one full cup. I thought the tart-to-sweet ratio was pretty good, but perhaps I would add a little less sugar and/or more lemon next time.

This recipe is a the perfect lemonade - tarty and sweet. One thing I did when I made this recipe was that I used one less lemon, but that's just because I like my lemonade to be more sweet than tarty. I also mixed the sugar with one cup of boiling water so that it would melt. But that meant I had to put the lemonade in there fridge overnight for the pens cup of hot water to cool down.

My 9 year old wanted to make lemonade. We used 7 lemons (to get to 1 cup of juice) and dissolved the sugar is 2 of the cups of water. It came out perfectly delicious! Thanks for this simple recipe.

For sure boil or heat in the microwave at least 2 cups of water so that the sugar will dissolve. Doing this makes all the difference...to me the difference between sweet tea and cold tea you have to put sugar into yourself! Very yummy and a great balance of sweet and tart.  
F.Y.I we used 4 lemons to get a cup of lemon juice...we let the lemons rest in hot water for several minutes then rolled them.

As others have said,  you must combine the sugar and water first, bring to a boil. Also, replace as much of your water with an equal amount of ice to cool the syrup. This gives the lemonade a smooth candy-like feel to it. In my humble opinion it isn't "old fashioned" lemonade if those steps are skipped.

Bonus, add two tablespoons of vanilla extract as soon as you remove the syrup from the heat.

I did 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the full for a tarter taste and my oldest has to be on a low sugar diet. We prefer to cut sugar amounts in half instead of using substitutes.

A very kid friendly lemonade. Sweet and not too tart. An extra bit of lemon juice could be added to make it more sour. I used organic cane sugar and it was great.

This was very good, but I will be doubling the amounts since it can to about 2 quarts and not a gallon. The taste reminds me so much of the lemonade from the State Fair and it beats the store bought lemonade hands down.

I added a little more lemon juice than the 1 cup, and it was bitter.  Still drinkable, but I think I would listen to the recipe and just use the 1 cup of lemon juice.  I probably added about a quarter cup extra just because I had extra.  Stick with the one cup.  Other than that, great recipe.

I used my juicer and was able to get 1 2/3 cups of lemon juice from 6 lemons. I then added The same amount of sugar as lemon juice, 1 2/3 cups. Then I used 7 cups of water. I like my lemonade a little on the strong/tart side so that as the ice melts in my cup, it only gets better!

So first off I changed the recipe a bit. I take one cup sugar to about 1 1/2 cups water boil the water throw in the sugar and about the zest of one lemon. I mix that with the juice of six lemons (about 6-8oz) and then add like 3 more cups of cold water. This gives it a way more lemoney flavor.  I also throw in 3-6 thinly sliced lemons into my jug.

Delicious. I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I used bottled lemon juice. It was fine, but I'm sure it will be even better with real lemons, so I'll try that next time. I knew going in that I prefer my lemonade on the tart side, so I cut the sugar back to 3/4 of a cup, and that was almost right. Next time I'll start with 2/3 of a cup and go from there. (I had exactly a cup of lemon juice left in my bottle, so I couldn't just add more juice to get the tartness I desired, but it was still good. A full cup of sugar would have been too much though.)

I added some sliced strawberries to this recipe, and let it set in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.  Makes an awesome fresh strawberry lemonade!

The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly but I found it a but sweet, it was still really good but I like lemonade a bit tart. I reduced the sugar to a half cup the second time and it was perfect.

Used Meyer lemons and Splenda to make a fabulous lemonade.  Since we like our lemonade more tart I used 4 cups water and 1 1/2 cups lemon juice.  Happy family tonight! Thanks

The recipe is a classic and you can do some variations with zesting (do not use the pith...the white portion of the peel will cause bitterness in the final concoction.) and sugaring with boiling water for about 15-20 minutes to release the lemon oils before adding the lemon juice & the rest of the water...but no matter how you slice your lemons...this is a basis for all great lemonades. DO use as much of the fruit as possible...straining out only the seeds and not the fleshy part of the fruit.

I love this lemonade... it's a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.. and it doesn't require pots and pan either.. My bf has a huge sweet tooth and requested more sugar but for me it's perfect. Thanks for sharing!!

Tried and true, awesome old-fashioned lemonade. Does exactly what it says on the tin, so to speak. Thanks for sharing, it's the best thing ever on a hot summer day! I ended up using seven lemons rather than six just for personal preference.

This was so easy to make and it is great.  Way better than store bought lemonade.  I actually added the juice of an orange to change it up a little.  makes it just a little sweeter.  Maybe you could even use a little less sugar with the orange juice.  The only thing that even compares at all is Simply Lemonade.
