These are DELICIOUS! I used a combo of Red, Yellow, and Orange Bell Peppers and everything came out super yummy. The leftovers were even good. I did cheat a little... I used a "Success" brown rice bag so the cook time was only 10 minutes in the microwave. GREAT recipe!

I love artichokes and I love feta cheese, so I thought I would try these out. I think the only change I made was roasting the pepper halves before I added the filling. I put them on 350 until I could poke a fork into it, not too easily - maybe 15 minutes? I think I also added some of the oil from the artichokes into the saucepan. I topped with parsley at the end of it, and it was amazing. I thought the artichokes give it all the flavour it needs. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought with the ingredients it would be more interesting. Not enough flavor for us.

I loved this recipe.  Much lighter than using meat for the stuffing.  I substituted mushrooms for the tomatoes since my son cannot eat tomatoes.  The spices -- ground black pepper and red pepper flakes -- gave it a nice peppy flavor.

Delicious recipe! I used quinoa instead of rice (follow directions on pkg) and a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh as that's what I had on hand. I just put the empty peppers in the oven to soften them up while it was preheating, maybe 10 mins? Good flavor, nice and zesty, and best of all, healthy! Will make again for sure.

I love the mix of Mediterranean flavors.   I made it with quinoa, because it's was handy, and it was just as flavorful.  Next time I will precook the peppers so they'll be softer.

These are fabulous! I did take Taylorr's advice and roast peppers for 15 min first. I also added some sliced black olives to the stuffing. It doubles as your veggie and side dish. We had ours with roast duck.

Very happy with how these stuffed peppers came out, including the flavor.  I did salt the water used to cook the rice and baked the peppers the additional 10 minutes so they'd be soft. I made one change with the ingredients: instead of green onions, I used some chives and chopped onions.  The flavor combination of onion, garlic, herbs,red pepper flakes / pepper (which I just sprinkled on without measuring), artichoke hearts, tomato, feta, and red bell pepper came out great.   Next time I'll maybe add even more tomato and  use up the entire package of feta.  It would also be good to add chopped nuts or pine nuts or seeds and maybe try a different grain such as quinoa.

these were good but the changes i made were...i cooked the rice 15 minutes and the stuffed peppers 45 minutes instead of the other way around.
Also i cut the peppers lengthwise and left the core in for stability. I blanched the half peppers for about 8 minutes before i stuffed them.
The only other change i made was that i used the white part of leeks instead of green onions

This is a very good and healthy meal. I microwaved the peppers for a few minuets to soften them up. I added 1 heaping teaspoon of Greek seasoning and some sliced olives. I also doubled the amount of feta in the bottom and on top. All said and done, it was good and very low in calories and full of fiber.

I baked these for 30 min covered in foil, then finished uncovered under the broiled. Needed more seasoning.

Easy, healthy, and full of veggies! Great idea! 

I also added kalamata olives and used a brown rice/whole grains/quinoa "minute rice" blend which made it quicker and added more nutrients. I also added a can of chicken for my meat-loving hubby.

I have made this many times-it is one of my favorites. I never thought I would like peppers without a ton of sauce but sauce is totally unneeded. It is so flavorful! I usually substitute farro for the brown rice. This past time I threw in some sliced black olives. Always impresses!

I decided it was time to learn how to cook - at 57 years old!  This was the first recipe I tried, and it came out great.  Like others I added some sliced black olives.  I also used yellow and orange bell peppers in addition to red.

It looked like there was too much green onion in the recipe, but it turned out to be just right.  Will be making this on a regular basis!

Delicious. Good recipe as is and easy to tweak based on what's in the frig. Tonight I halved this recipe and I decided to chop the bell peppers and skip the baking step.  I forgot the tomatoes! I sauteed the peppers with a chopped onion until almost caramelized.  Added the garlic along with some chopped mushrooms and cooked a few minutes.  Then added the rest of the ingredients plus a can of cannellini beans.  Just before serving I added some fresh spinach and the cheese.  Served over leftover rice. The stars of the recipe are the artichoke hearts and the feta!

I would actually rate this as 3.5 stars, but since that isn't an option, I'm going with 4. I used green bell peppers instead of red, and so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt that the sweeter peppers would push it to 4. It's good... I just feel like its missing something. Maybe I'll try it again with some of the suggestions from the other reviewers and see if that takes it up to a 5. Also,had to bake it for more like 40 minutes until the peppers were soft enough for my liking.

We loved this, I did roast the peppers first, we also added olives, Italian seasoning, we used white onions instead of green.  Also at the end, I turned on the broiler to give them feta a nice browned top.  Delicious, will make again!
