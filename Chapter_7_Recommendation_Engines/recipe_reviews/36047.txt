Great marinade for chicken!  I used 4 split chicken breasts for this and made the marinade a little thicker.  I doubled the brown sugar and the worcestershire and omitted the water.  I used white wine vinegar instead of distilled because it's milder and only 1/2 cup of V8.  Whenever I see ketchup in a marinade I always substitute chili sauce as a rule of thumb because it provides that little extra kick.  I let the chicken marinate overnight and finished it on the grill. You can even baste it with a bit of your favorite BBQ sauce towards the end if you want it extra special.

This was really yummy! I only gave it four stars, though, because I would have liked the sauce to be a little bit thicker. The second time I made it, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine. I liked it better that way.

This was so yummy!!!  I also marinated the chicken for about an hour then popped it in the oven when my husband got home from work.  The house smelled wonderful while it was baking.  I served it over pasta with some cheese bread and it was fantastic.  Even my three year old loved it.  

I didn't find it overly spicy but it did have a very nice Texas tang to it.  I will definitely be making this again.

I absolutly adore this recipe.  It is a GREAT go to meal.  I always have the ingredients on hand.  I have a 2 1/2 month old daughter and I am always trying to find something that can be cooked between feedings and/or during naps this is so easy to make and so tasty that I make it a lot.  I have discoverd that if you put is in the crock pot for double the oven time it is so much nicer to shred and so tender too.  Just put it in on high for 90 min then shred and put back for 30 min it takes longer but is so much better.  My husband eats it just on the plate but I prefer to have it on a hoagie with sweet onion and cheddar cheese.  I also make a "Texas BBQ Chicken Quesedilla" with it buy putting a tortilla down and putting mexican cheese mix that is already shredded, it's by Kraft, on half of the tortilla then chicken fallowed by onion top it off with more cheese and fold the tortilla over nuke it in the microwave until cheese is melted and VIOLA. I serve with either mashed potatos or french fries and baked beans.

This was pretty good.  The sauce had a tangy flavor.  I left the chicken breasts whole and spooned more sauce over them before serving.  Next time I'll try marinating them.

I really liked this recipe. Super easy!!! It smelled wonderful as it cooked. We did increase the cooking time to almost one hour before shredding the chicken. We are Weight Watchers and this is a great, tasty low-point entree.We served it over toasted 1 point bread instead of rice. It was even better the next day! I plan to try it in the crockpot next time.

It smells great, but lacks the spicy zip that you would expect from the aroma.  Good if you like mild, tame if you like spice.

Very good recipe. I spiced it up a bit with some red pepper flakes and added some bottled BBQ sauce (just have to cook it down more but it gets nice and thick).  I also substituted Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning for the salt. I served it over brown rice with some steamed veggies on the side and my boyfriend loved it! He even said how good the chicken and rice would be on a flour tortilla with some cheese.

This recipe was excellent. It tasted wonderful, and smelled wonderful. I just made two alterations: Apple Cider Vineger instead of White Vineger and Splenda instead of Brown Sugar.

I thought this recipe would be amazing but I didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't taste anything like barbecue, the sauce/mix was runny (even after cooking) and overall I was really disappointed. And, for those wanting to try this (which I personally wouldn't recommend), I would double the cooking time. The chicken was nowhere near done for me. It was worth a try, though.

Not very good at all. Lacking in flavour and spunk. Easy to make but I wouldn't bother.

Having visited GA, NC &TN last year on holiday from the UK I fell in love with some of the wonderful BBQ sauces   available.  I had hoped this would remind me of them.  Unfortunately either my memory is faulty or my taste buds have changed.  This was easy to make but did not have the same depth of flavour as either sweet baby rays or carolina sweet. Perhaps Texas bbq is very different from  others. On the plus side it is quick and easy to make and friends did love it.

I was expecting a little bit more of a BBQ flavor, but found this one has a pretty strong cayenne pepper taste! I'm not big on spicy, so I wasn't too pleased with that fact, but overall was a good meal, very easy and quick (I prepared mine in the afternoon, refrigerated to let the meat marinate and then popped it in the oven before dinner time) and went over well with my family. (And it really did SMELL great while it was cooking!)

This was good, I modified it a little because I didn't have tomato-vegetable juice, so I used bbq sauce.  I didn't get the caramelization probably because I didn't put in the brown sugar.

I wished I had read the reviews first and made alterations.  The sauce is indeed to watery, so omit the water, but the color was also not appealing...tasted fabulous though!  I was looking for a darker color. Mixed with white rice, it looks a little bland.  Three stars on presentation, four starts on taste.

This sauce was way too thin. Gave the chicken a bloody/raw look. Pretty gross. I followed the recipe exactly except omitted the cayenne.

Yum!!

My husband and I used this recipe to make BBQ chicken sandwiches.  Really, all you needed was some buns because the chicken and sauce were incredible!

We added a bit of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce in the last couple minutes of cooking as another reviewer suggested - yum oh!

With the left overs we made homemade BBQ chicken pizza.  We used the sauce as a sub for marinara, added some red onion and mexican mix shredded cheese and the result was delish!  Highly recommend this recipe!

This was pretty good.  I left out the cayenne pepper because of my toddler, but the taste was still good.  A bit watery as other reviewed noted, but I added about 3/4 cup of cut up mushrooms and 1/2 red bell pepper strips which helped.  I marinated the chicken and veggies in the sauce for 8 hours beforehand.  I made it with chicken thighs and cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes.  It turned out extremely tender.  I will note that we didn't really care for the sauce on the rice we served it with, but the sauce on the chicken and veggies was good.

I don't know what kind of puny chickens the author is used to cooking, but when I cooked my split chicken breasts by these directions (35 min. @ 350°) the chicken was nowhere near done. I cooked it an additional 30 minutes @ 350° because that's what another recipe said it needed. Turns out that was exactly what it needed. Also, I didn't use this recipe for the sauce. Instead I used store bought (KC Masterpiece) which my family loves. Adjusting the cooking time (by doubling it) made this recipe work well enough, so I give it three out of five stars.

I must say I was very happy with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. The flavor wasn't spice at all! I love spicy thing but my parents and brother do not. They loved it!!! 
  I did everything the same except that I did not have any tomato juice. It was actually perfect. I know there were a few people that said it was really think! It work for me! I also used Cider Vinegar and a few drops of liquid smoke!  I mixed it up and coated the chicken in it, then poured the rest of the sauce over it and let it sit about 2 hours. Baked it till was done, took the chix out let it rest. Strained the sauce to get most of the fat out. Then pulled the chicken from the bone and made a Chix BBQ sandwiches! Yah SOOOO GOOD. Thank you so much! It's an excellent sauce for Chicken Tenders!!! :) I would give this a higher rating if I could

This was way too runny for me. And it had very little flavor.  I will stick with the bottled sauce.

We really liked this recipe!  Lots of flavour, nutritious & low-fat!!  I served the chicken over rice.  Then, we used the leftovers in tortilla wraps with cheese & salsa.  Delicious!

The sauce was delicious and certainly easy to prepare.  However, the chicken (skinless, boneless breasts) was so dry--thus the 4 stars.

Pretty good, servred over rice and added some green pepper and onion. Added more cayenne than I thought and boy was it spicy! But still good

Yummy, but I had to half the recipe for my family of 4 hearty eaters and we still had left overs.  The left overs freeze well and reheat quickly.

Not my favorite...a little bland. Marinating for several hours or more seems to be a good idea.

Tasty and easy to make.  I served the chicken and sauce over steamed white rice.  Next time, I would definitely let the chicken marinate in the sauce overnight for more flavor.

Yum! Everyone at our house liked this. We were in a rush the first night so we ate them as chicken breasts. The second night we ate the leftover chicken shredded over rice. Even better!

First time I made it, it was a little too runny and didn't taste enough like southern BBQ for me. (I like more of a mesquite or hickory flavor) I liked the idea though so I made again using bottled BBQ sauce (suggestion of another member)and served on large rolls.  Makes a great sandwich filling.

After reading the list of ingrediants I thought this was going to be really hot.  Me and my husband both like this, but I don't know if I really like the taste that the vegetable juice cocktail gives it.  It all taste good on JUST the chicken but not on anything else, like rice, etc....

It was just ok for me.  My sauce was too runny and very bland.  I tried to add flavor by adding onions, green peppers & more pepper sauce. It does seem better if you let it set overnight.

For flavor, I give this 3 stars - the sauce was thin, the flavor was ok, but not outstanding.  For ease, I give this 5 stars - simple to put together, pop in the oven and forget about it.  Thus, 4 stars overall.

Very tasty. I didn't measure the ingredient, except for the juice so I may have been off on some things. I used a carrot/greens vegetable juice blend instead of a tomato based juice. My sauce thickend up nicely. I marinated this over night and then after cooking put it in the fridge for the next day's dinner. I served this over brown rice. I do think next time I make this, I'll add in some vegatbles to make this a complete one dish meal.. mushrooms, zucchini.. etc.

Eh.  I'm not sure what I was expecting...but this was shredded chicken in a very thin bbq sauce.  Not horrible--just not worth making again.

Doesn't meat my description of BBQ flavor but it was very good.  I served it with Coleslaw and Kaiser Rolls and we had North Carolina BBQ.  It was yummy with some pre-made sauce as a condiment.  Very easy to make and I would make it again.

This was a very nice recipe. I  marinated the chicken overnight, and I did have to cook the chicken for an hour, even after cutting the chicken into smaller pieces than the recipe specified.  I noticed that the sauce tasted a bit too much like its main ingredient--vegetable juice--so maybe I'll reduce that item next time in the recipe.  I served this with "Angie's Dad's Coleslaw" (which is the best!) and Yellow or Summer Squash Casserole (very good), both from this site.  I'll make this meal again.

My husband and I thought this recipe was alright. My 3 year old ate really well because the chicken was shredded, so that was a plus. We left out the cayenne pepper because we didn't have it, but I think it would have only changed the spice factor. I would possibely make this again as a fill in dinner or just for something different.

This recipe was super easy to make and was really tasty too.  I let it marinate for 3 hours before i put it in the oven.  It was accompanied by rice (I had cooked the rice in chicken broth, but there was no need for that, because there was enough sauce to go over the rice and chicken) and corn.  Wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be.  Made a great and easy meal!

I like your basic BBQ sauce from a bottle more then this recipe. Actually, that is what I ended up doing.  Was OK, just not one of those "keeper" recipes.

Tasted great! I left out the water, added a few dashes of two different hot sauces and used chicken tenders in a 9x9 pan.  Went well with mashed potatoes.

We had this tonight for dinner. I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give it a chance. It was too much tomato and not enough kick. The flavor was dull and lacking. Won't make again.
