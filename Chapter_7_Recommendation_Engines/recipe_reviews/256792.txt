I made the recipe exactly as written.  Everyone really liked it but agreed you cannot eat a lot of it.  It is packed with flavor.  You definitely need to have a good portion of the cream cheese with a bite of the peach topping otherwise the peach topping would be way too overpowering.  But together they are tasty.  I served it with bagel chips which seemed to be a good combination.
