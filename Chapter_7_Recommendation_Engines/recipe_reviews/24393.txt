4 stars as written, but 5+ plus with these modifications: add 1/2 cup chopped carrots, an extra stalk of celery, 1 1/2 cups frozen corn, 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and cream of potato soup instead of cream of chicken. Seasoned with white and black pepper, parsely, and oregano and threw in a bay leaf. Also stirred in about a cup of shredded cheese, let simmer for 15 minutes, and it thickened up beautifully. Result? CREAMY & DELICIOUS!!! We loved this; both agreeing it is the best potato soup we've ever had!

Extremely easy, extremely tasty!  I used several of the revisions posted by others including adding a can of cream of celery soup, using the full pound of kielbasa, adding carrots and an extra stalk of celery.  I also used whole milk instead of the water and red potatoes (skin on) because they hold together the best and are less likely to dissolve into mush.  I started by saut√©ing the onions, carrots and celery in a light drizzle of olive oil before adding the other ingredients.  This is a keeper!

This was simple, used on hand ingredients and didn't cost much to make. This is a nice base soup but if I make this again, I'll play with the recipe a bit to goose it up.

I am outraged about this recipe. Because of it all five of my children ages 15 thru 4 made me make it twice this week.  My husband wants me to make it so he could eat it at work.  This recipe is too good for a hard working women that has to keep making it.

This recipe was delicious.  I did use some thickening as well as far more potatoes than called for, an extra can of chicken broth (I didn't have beef) and 1 beef bouillon cube.  This tasted almost like a traditional German soup that my mom-in-law makes that takes her all day to do.  The only thing different in hers is homemade "kneflas" (noodles).  I may try that next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really good warm comfort food.  Being pregnant I tend to nod off right when it's time to think about "what's for dinner" so I threw all the liquid ingredients, meat, and veggies in my crock pot and cooked on low for about 4 hours.  I then cooked on high for another hour after adding red potatoes.  I omitted the beef broth, added a can of cream of celery, used milk instead of water, used onion powder instead of whole onion (my husband won't eat them), and threw in garlic, oregano and a bay leaf.  I also added extra celery and carrots (will add more next time - I like a lot of veggies.)  Might use low sodium cream soup and broth next time, but will make again!

This was a hearty easy meal that made it to the table in short order.  We doubled the potatoes, added a can of corn, and used smoked sausage.  I also added a cup of cheddar.  We topped it off with more cheddar and sliced green onion as a garnish and a side of crusty bread for dipping.  Yum!

This soup is pure comfort food.  It's quite easy to make--after the veggies and sausage are chopped, it's a hands-off meal.  I prefer to slice the kielbasa into thin medallions and top the soup with strips of raw red bell pepper and green onions.

I did add carrots but that was the only change I made. This was pretty tasty and my only complaint is that the canned cream soup flavor came through more than I like and expected it to. If I make this again, I will make my own cream base and not use the can. Fresh herbs would also improve this recipe.

My husband and I thought this soup was excellent!  I didn't have any celery, so that was left out, but I followed the rest of the recipe and added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  It was definately hearty enough to eat as a meal.

This was okay.  My husband hated it, but he is not a fan of potato soup.  The taste was fine, but it needed something else to make it something special and to make it more of a heartier meal.  Maybe the addition of noodles as a prior reviewer stated or thicken it up more and serve over rice.  Just by itself is not enough.

Delish!  I took other reviewers' advice and used a full pound of sausage, seven potatoes instead of four, and milk instead of water.  Everything else remained the same and I thought it turned out fantastic. Great recipe!

I've made this for my family and also for potluck's at work & there's never any left!  I sautee the sausage & onions together while the potatoes are simmering (I also use way more potatoes) & then toss it all together.  I added carrots, garlic, a can of creamed corn to thicken it a little, cream of mushroom soup & milk instead of water. Yumm-o!

This was so easy and fast. I added a lot of chopped carrots and celery. We had a baguette with it. The kids loved dipping the bread in the soup. Delicious soup!

Oh Wow!  What an easy and flavorful soup.  Made it just according to recipe, but added a few extra seasonings. Added a dash each of savory, garlic, cumin, rosemary, and sage. Even better the second day!

I don't understand why people are taking a star away for lack of carrots. Traditional potato and kielbasa soup doesn't have carrots, but if you like them that's your thing. For me this soup is perfect, though I tweak it to my taste as well, which has nothing to do with the rating of the recipe.

I followed this recipe as written and it was outstanding. You can really get creative and ad carrots, corn, shrimp, spinach, whatever. This one is a keeper and I'll keep going back to it. Thanks for sharing!

I converted this to a slow cooker recipe. I used 32 oz cartons of chicken and beef broth and put in half of each into the slow cooker. I added 1/2 the potatoes and let them cook down to nothing. This created a nice thick base for the rest of the ingredients. When I got home, I added the rest of the broth, potatoes and veggies and let them cook through. I sauted the kielbasa to add some depth and through the meat in when the veggies were cooked. I omitted the can of condensed soup (cheaper that way and I didn't have it on hand.)

YUMM! This was a big hit at my house.  Even my 16 mth old wanted 2nd's.  The only change I made was omiting the water and adding 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese. We like it thicker, like a stew.  I cut the sausage into 1/4's (easier for baby to eat) and mashed the potatoes slightly.  This will be added to my favorites. Thanks for sharing!

Nobody complained about it, so I guess they liked it.  I ate quite a bit of it and I thank you for this recipe.  I still can't figure out why it's called creamy.

It has great flavor but next time as  another reviewer suggested I will add a few more potatoes and some carrots. It did need more body. It was quite easy to throw together. Gona try the leftovers tonite and it will probably have even better flavor.

I made this because I had some kielbasa sausage taking up space in the freezer. I used chicken broth, beef broth, skim milk, thyme, rosemary, and salt for the base. I sauteed carrots,celery, onion, potatoes (4), and kielbasa in olive oil to soften them up a bit. Didn't add cream of chicken because I wanted a lighter soup. The flavoring is just right and itturned out very good. I used the lite version of kielbasa so it actually turned out to be very healthy.

I added the carrots,corn,red potatoes(some skin left on) and xtra celery. I sauteed the onion,celery,carrots and kielbasa first. Then added liquids. I doubled recipe. I used 3 or 4 dashes of garlic salt w/parsley. My whole family really liked this soup. My daughter is going to cook it for her family. I cooked it for 40 minutes. At the end of cooking, I threw in a few handfuls of grated cheddar and blended well, then served. MMmm  Mmm good!!

This recipe is great! I used 4 beef bouillon cubes and 5 cups of water (total) since I didn't have can beef or chicken broth. I also substituted celery seed for celery stalk. My daughters and I loved the simplicity of the soup! Served it with crusty Italian bread. Quick, easy, hearty dinner for a weekday night.

This was very good.  I did make it differently than the recipe called.  Not because I thought I could make it better, but because I didn't have everything.  I omitted the celery, and used all chicken broth... even in place of the water.  I believe it was 36 ounces total.  I also used the whole pound of kielbasa (reduced fat) instead of 3/4 pound.  I think the celery or some carrots would be good in this.  I also think it would have been better if it would have been a bit thicker.  I mixed some cornstarch with water and added it to the soup and it helped a little.  Note:  I tasted this right after I added the cream of chicken and kielbasa, and I was worried that it would taste too much like plain old "cream of chicken" soup.  BE PATIENT.  As the soup simmers, it will take on more of the flavor of the sausage.

I loved this, it was so delicious. I brought it to work to share and while I was telling my friend the recipe, people took out paper and pen and started copying it down! I didnt use onion or celery because my husband doesnt like it and I added a little cream to the soup with the creamed soup.

I followed the recipe exactly, expecting to be wowed after reading so many positive reviews.  We couldn't understand what all the raving was over. We felt like something was missing...carrots or corn or cheese or something more than potatoes & celery.  The flavor was alright, but I think my own creamy potato soup is much better.  Interesting use for kielbasa, though.  It's hard to find a recipe for it that doesn't include sauerkraut or cabbage.

I also swapped the cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom, added another cup of chopped fresh mushrooms, and added carrots, a little bit of garlic and a handful of shredded white cheddar.  I also added maybe a 1/4 cup of powdered milk to cream it up a bit more too.

Amazing!  Everyone in my house loved this, including a very picky 13 yr old boy :)  I made according to directions, but took a few suggestions from other reviews & added raw carrotts & one extra stalk of celery. I also used a full pound of Kielbasa (will add even more next time). I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese at the end right before serving. Thank you for such a delicious hearty meal!

This was great! I tweaked the recipe just a little, though: per another reviewer's response, I used whole milk in the place of the water. Also, I used cream of mushroom soup and boiled the potatoes before adding them to my crockpot to slow cook all morning so it would be ready when we came home from church this afternoon. I added two cans of CREAMED corn and it made the texture oh-so-creamy and nice. I think this is going to become a staple around my house!

Even though I added more vegetables and had to thicken it....5 stars for a great idea that me and the husband loved!!  Added carrots, cabbage, and basil and parsley.  Used more chicken broth/boullion too.

This was surprisingly tasty. I found a Buy-1pkg.-get-2, sausage sale, and had no idea how to use them up. I tried this because it looked quick and I had all the ingredients on hand. It was VERY GOOD! I did add chopped carrots and a can of corn AND saute'ed the sausage(I used Reduced Fat summer sausage)for some added flavor. Will make again, the same way. Thank You, for a QUICK, EASY, and DELICIOUS recipe:can't have enough of those!

This came out great, using some of the suggetions from others, I added sliced carrots w/the potatoes, froz corn & peas at the end, used cream of celery soup (w/milk, not water) and I also added crumbled bacon and shredded colby cheese at the end.  I "sweated" the celery, onion and minced garlic (with a little oregano and basil) in a combo of olive & chili oils at the beginning, before adding the potatoes & broth. Great flavor and a nice change from the way I always make kielbasa.

My husband loved this.  The smell of it cooking reminded me of split pea soup which I don't like but my husband does.  He loves thicker soups so this was excellent with the cream of chicken soup.  Even I enjoyed it.  I may try adding some vegetables next time.  It's easy and on my list of repeats!

Omitted the beef broth, but used all else.  After it was done, it tasted like canned soup so I added 1 Tb butter, 1 Tb parsley, and 1 1/2 cups greated sharp Cheddar.  My husband absolutely loved it!  Creamy and thick (we like it that way). I'd give it 5* but I made so many changes.

Outstanding, with some modifications from the reviews!  My search for a good creamy potato soup is over.  My changes: used cheddar cheese soup in place of cream of chicken (yum), added an extra 1/2 stalk of celery, cup+ of frozen corn, 2 chopped carrots, onion powder, oregano, pepper, minced garlic, and poultry seasoning.  Followed cooking instructions as written, but ended up simmering for a bit longer, as I was waiting for my husband to get home.  I only used 1/2 of a sweet onion, which I fished out at the end b/c my family doesn't like them.  Added a handful of cheddar/monterey jack shreds at the end (not really necessary though).  Topped with some more cheese and a dollop of sour cream in bowls.  Super satisfying, yummy, thick, and creamy with no need for additional thickener.  One more note: I made this a second time, doubled the recipe, and tried to do it in the slow cooker.  I only used 1 can beef broth, added a can of cream of chicken soup, and cooked it about 3 1/2 hours on high (including about an hour with the lid slightly open to help thicken it).  The potatoes weren't done and I was in a hurry so I moved it to the stove top to finish it off.  It never thickened up as much as the first time making it.  Problems were: not long enough in the slow cooker, then despite simmering another 20 mins or so the potatoes still didn't get very soft and definitely didn't break down.  Point: do it on the stove, as my first review indicates!

3 stars as written 5 stars after I was done with it :) I doubled everything, used 1 can cream chicken, 1 can cream celery, milk instead of water, added corn, shredded cheddar on top, garlic, red pepper flakes, onion salt and I made a roux to thicken. I did not use can broth but granuals instead. I am one of those ppl who eyeball stuff so I do not have precise measurments. LOL if I had any carrots I would have tossed those in also.

This was a very good recipe as written, but with a few adjustments, this was a five star recipe!! I, like most suggested, doubled the potatoes, used the whole pound of kielbasa, substituted the water with milk and added shredded cheddar cheese. I also left out the celery, substituted the creamed chicken soup for creamed celery soup, added a dash of garlic, a bouillon cube and a bay leaf, grated a large carrot and shredded about four cups of cabbage, added to the pot, cooked the suggested time, then added a splash of hot sauce to bowl, this was delicious!!! next time i will try the whole kernel corn and maybe a 1/2 cup of rice...very good and plenty of flavor!!

This was good, but needed more flavor for my family.  I browned the kielbasa to get more of a smokey flavor and added black beans to the mix.  I was in the mood for a thick and creamy soup, so I had to add quite a bit of cornstarch to get it to the right consistancy.  One thing I'll say is that the base of this soup is very open to adding any kind of additional ingredients that are family favorites like carrots, corn, beans, etc.  I'll be making this one again and playing with the base recipe to create something that will be added to the regular winter rotation of hearty soups.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm sure it's not bad as is, but I did make a few changes. Sauteed the sausage, removed. Sauteed onion, celerey (2), carrot (2), and some crushed garlic, removed. Put in stock; added 4 peeled, cubed potatoes. REmoved after they'd boiled till fork-tender; pureed with some stock; returned to the pot. Added meat & veggies, 4 more potatoes, up to 1/2 lb of lentils. Brought to a boil, reduced to simmer, added 2 cups of milk - DON'T let it boil again. Let it slowly return to a simmer for at least 30 mins or till lentils are done. Didn't add soup. Amazing.

Very easy and quick and can add so many different vegetable to change it up. I used corn, carrots, potatoes, spinach and onion. Very good and hearty with crusty french bread. My husband and son loved it and asked me to make again.

Fantastic! I made the recipe as written, other than using a full pound of kielbasa and adding a cup or so of frozen corn. Also delicious topped with cheddar cheese and/or sour cream. Served it with french bread. Will make again! I think next time I'll also add some chopped red peppers.

I read most of the reviews and do not like to alter the original recipe, too much. If you alter the recipe, you might as well write your own and post, accordingly.  I used a 16 oz. pkg. of Hillshire Farms Lil' Smokies saugage, sliced, in place of the Kielbasa.  Thank you for this bowl of GOOD!!!!!

This was really tasty on a cold winter night, and quick to make.  I ended up only having 3 potatoes, but it still was great.   I'm going to keep this around and try to modify it so its a little healthier, my only complaint....

Very good soup. It needs more potatoes, and could use some carrots. Instead of cream of chicken, use cream of clerey, more flavorful that way. I took the skin of the kielbasa, and diced it.

everyone in the house raved about this soup.  i substituted light turkey kielbasa, and used half a can of creamed corn along with the rest of the ingredients.  all in all, it came out very well and there wasn't a drop left in the pot.

Great soup for a cold night! 
Used a pound of kielbasa and cooked it in the pot beforehand to get some of the grease off of it, drained the grease, then added the onion, celery and a garlic clove to the pot.  Got the potatos and broth in, then added some chopped carrots and let it simmer.  Also added a bay leaf, oregano, parsley and a little of this and that to boost the flavor.  Used cr. of potato instead of chicken, and added about 8oz of frozen corn, then pureed about half the soup.  After adding the puree back in, also put in a 12oz. can of evap. milk.  
Creamy, hearty, and delicious.

I made a few changes: sauteed the onions first is a little EVOO; used bouillon cubes instead of canned broth; didn't have celery or cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of celery soup; added a can of cheddar cheese soup; used a full pound of turkey kielbasa (I didn't want to save the extra four ounces). I thought it came out pretty good. I don't know if I'll make it again, though, because it still seemed a bit greasy, even with turkey kielbasa instead of regular.

This soup was really good, especially on a cold day! I didn't have celery so left that out and added a cup of shredded cheddar but otherwise followed the recipe. My picky three year old even liked it.  I served it with corn bread and it was more than enough for a meal.

Didn't use the beef broth it asked for and added 3/4c shredded cheddar and turned out just fine.

I really liked this recipe but I made a few changes to it.I made it thicker by adding some mashed potato flakes. I also used chicken and beef cubes each one mixed with a cup of water because I had no broth. I put in about a cup mixed vegtables I had and it was so good. I also adding seasonings to my taste. It was a meal in it's self. Thankyou!

This was so good. A repeat recipe. Altered after reading reviews. Added 2 cans of cream corn, filled empty cream corn with milk and added that, also added 8 oz of carrots. Sauteed the veggies at the beginning (except potatoes) to speed up the cooking process for the carrots. Ours almost had a corn chowder taste about it. Was very good.

Pretty good! I didn't have celery so I added celery salt instead and did add carrots as well. I made mine a little healthier with 98% fat free cream of chicken and low sodium broths.  I also used turkey sausage.

Pretty good! I used my slow cooker. used 2 cans of chicken broth, 4 red potatoes as suggested by another reviewer, milk, some seasonings.  Put that on low for about 4 hours. Then I added 2 celery stalks, a pound of kielbasa, a can of cream of potato and frozen corn.  Cooked that on high for another hour.  Added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese last.  Next time, I will use russet potatoes cause I want them to break down. The red ones stayed pretty intact. Overall, very good! Will make again on a cold night!

This soup is a huge hit with everyone I've ever made it for! I just have a few changes I make-I leave out the celery, use all chicken broth, and smoked sausage instead of kielbasa. I also add some cooked, diced bacon that I saute w/ the onion & smoked sausage. This soup is sooo versatile, that is the great thing about it!

This is delicious. I added some chopped carrots, garlic powder, and extra pepper. I added a cup of milk instead of water and some shredded cheese and half & half as well. Also, I thickened it with a little milk/flour.

I started this soup early before I went to work put on low heat and it was wonderful. I did add one item and that was a small pinch of dill. I thought dumplings might also be good with this. SO I opened a can of biscuits, cut them into quarters and dropped them into the soup. They were great.

I made this for dinner last night and it was good - I gave four stars because it was a little salty for our taste, but will make again maybe trying low salt broth.  Dipping bread in it was yu-um!

Excellent! I found it to be a tad salty so I added an extra potato to it and added whipping cream at the end.  Great winter meal!  Baked Cornbread along with it! Loved it!!!

This meal is amazing. I did however make slight changes due to what I had in my pantry. Instead of both beef and chicken broth, I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes in 4 1/2cups of water, I added thinly sliced carrots, and I also used Cream of Chicken with Herb Soup.  I will be making this so many more times. Writing this one down in my recipe book!

I made this and it was a great! With a large family I always buy the bulk pack of Kielbasi and sometimes have left over. Found this quick soup and boy was it a hit.  Add a salad to the mix and it was yummy.

We have had better potato soups.  I found this one because I had some kielbasa sausage that I needed to use.  I was a little disappointed.   Sorry folks.

I added a leek, fresh fennel and a chopped fresh jalape√±o.... Did not add any salt because of the salt content of the kielbasa, nor did I add beef stock as I prefer chicken stock.   This was super easy and even the kids devoured it!!!

This is a really tasty and simple soup to make even on a weeknight.   Shockingly, everyone in the house liked it which is an accomplishment in and of iteself.   I did find the broth too thin at the end and ended up throwing in some shredded cheese to thicken it up.  Also added a few more hearty bits to make it chunkier (corn and carrots).   Will be keeping this on file for the future!

Great easy recipe!!! I always use some of the highest rated tips... So I ended up adding an additional can of soup, cream of potato, some garlic cloves, red and yellow peppers, and extra celery and water! Besides that I stuck to the recipe! Mmmmmmm

So good and perfect for our family.

Great recipe to work with...I halfed everything except the kielbasa, added 1 1/2 carrots, a cup of corn, 1/2 onion, and a clove of garlic.  No salt added as the reduced volume would have plenty of salt via the kielbasa on it's own.  Peppered to taste.  Made 6 servings.  Hopefully it'll freeze well.

Thank you Chris523 for such a great recipe! Easy to make. Very yummy. Can't give this 5 stars, because I didn't make this exactly. I used sliced smoked sausage, 3/4 lb. baby carrots whole, 3 stalks of celery cut into sticks, 3 large chopped russet potatoes (skin on), a bay leaf, cream of mushroom soup mixed with 3 cups chicken stock, 1/2 Vidalia onion chopped, and a dash of garlic salt. Cooked in slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Superb!

Since German food is traditionally somewhat bland I knew that I would have to give this receipe a little extra kick to satisfy my husband's palate.  I just used items that I had on hand and followed suggestions of some of the other reviewers by adding vegetables, seasonings, and cheese.  I didn't have kielbasa so substituted bratwurst.  I also added a little bit of thyme and did not spare the white pepper.  Added a side of homemade applesauce and it made a very hearty meal that my husband dubbed VERY GOOD. Bottom line: this is a very good recipe to play around with until it satisfies your taste!

LOVE! Super easy, and you can throw anything you want.  I added corn, oregano, thyme and parsley to liven it up a bit.  I found one bowl to be very filling, but the man went back for seconds, he couldn't stop eating it!

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. I did add more vegetables than suggested, because the more I add, the more I can get my kids to eat. My husband said "I think you just found our new potato soup."

I have been looking for a hot dog soup recipe for my husband whose mother made it for him as a child. This seemed to match his description of the recipe except with kielbasa. So I switched the kielbasa for beef hot dogs. Otherwise I followed the recipe. He liked it alot! I thought is was good also. I did use low salt broths and I did not think it was too salty.

Good, but salty! I didn't use chicken broth & replaced it with 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I saved half of the beef broth & just topped up the can of broth with water.  Also, added 3 cups of sliced fresh mushrooms, 1.5 cup of sliced carrots and about 1 cup of frozen corn.  Originally I only put in 1 can of mushroom soup, but found it wasn't thick enough, probably from all of the extra liquid in the mushrooms.  Had a bunch of hungry men over for dinner so I had to cheat & put a lid on the casserole dish & place in the microwave for about 20 min and then placed it in the oven.  5 min. before serving I put grated sharp cheddar cheese on top and broiled it just until the cheese turns brown.  I don't think it makes too much of a difference, but I have used smokie Bavarian sausages in place of Kolbassa sausages.  The next time I make it, I'm going to slice up the sausages soak it in water for a while & then rinse it a few times before soaking as well as cook the mushrooms separately & drain some of the water first.  Also, probably wouldn't have to cook it as long if I cut the potatoes in small cubes. A good hearty meal! :)

I cooked the onion, celery, added carrots, and garlic in olive oil first.  I added in the sliced turkey kilebasa and 4 cubed red potatoes.  I let that cook a little.  Then I added in cream of potato soup and cream of chicken soup.  I added 1 can of reduced sodium chicken broth and 1 can of reduced sodium beef broth.  I added about a cup of 2% milk.  I let it all simmer for about an hour.  I also added in onion powder, garlic salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper, oregano, italian seasoning, and bay leaves. Right before serving I let a tablespoon of butter melt in. I also mixed a little of the soup broth with about a tablespoon of flour and teaspoon of cornstarch.  Then I poured that in the soup and let it simmer for a few more minutes. I served it with biscuits.  My husband loved it!

Delicious!  I substituted smoked sausage, added some red pepper flakes and threw it all in a slow-cooker (I'm lazy and love my vegetables a little soggy).  I served it over pasta, which turned it into more of a stew than soup. I'm definitely looking forward to the few days worth of leftovers in the fridge!  This will certainly go into my regular rotation.

Overall it had a good flavor.  It needed a little more "kick" though.  I will definately make again, but add a little more seasoning...maybe some cayenne.

Pretty good.  Very easy and filling on a chilly day.  I used the whole pound of kielbasa, because I just couldn't see saving 4 oz of kielbasa.  I also cooked and drained the kielbasa first to cut down on the grease; this did not sacrifice taste!  It's not a particularly attractive soup - it looks a little like a mud puddle or runny gravy, but I'm sure that's my personal preference.  The taste is simple but good.  Once complete, I thought it needed a little something extra so I added some bay leaf, oregano and garlic.

Next time I make this I will either use red potatoes or 3/4 cup barley instead of yellow potatoes.

What a great soup ~ I had a few changes due to lack of ingredients I had on hand.    I used 8 smaller red skinned potatoes and a can of cream of celery + a small can of condensed milk in place of the raw celery because I had none and then just a dollop of butter on the top after it was heated through.   I used the rest of the ingredients listed.   We really enjoyed this soup and one I would definitely make again and also for company.

This was a definite keeper at our house.  I am not a big fan of potato soups, but this one is so warm and filling!  I was cold when I started eating dinner and so much warmer when I finished!  Easy and Good!!

Who'd have thought these simple ingredients could make such a great tasting soup?!  1/2lb of light kielbasa and 98% fat-free cream of chicken worked perfectly.

I went looking for a recipe that was quick, easy, and that I had all the ingredients for without having to shop. WALAH! 

I made some minor changes. First, I used turkey kielbasa instead of beef or pork, red skin potatoes, low sodium cream of chicken soup, and bouillon cubes (1 beef, 1 chicken) since I don't keep small cans of broth on hand. 

I added parsley, garlic, and extra pepper as well. 

I think the turkey kielbasa and low sodium soup probably solved the "too salty" flavor previous reviewers mentioned. As well as making it a bit more healthy.

5 stars all the way around!

Wow - this was so quick and delicious.  I made no changes to the recipe at all.    I just made some fresh hot rolls and used the soup as the main course.   Luscious.

I thought this was pretty good,especially on a cold day. My husband thought it needed something like rice or noodles added to it (maybe we'll try that next time).

I don't care for beef broth, so I always substitute with chicken.  This was DELISH!  Can't wait to make it again!

Quick and simple.  A good combo if you are short on time and ingredients.  A meal for just the two of you.

This recipe was excellent. My husband and I made it last night and I think it's our new "what are we going to eat tonight?" recipe. We added a few more spices (lemon pepper, garlic salt, and a pinch of McCormick Cajun seasoning) to give it a bit more flavor, we also used a red bell pepper. Next time we will probably use two cans of cream of chicken soup to make it a bit more creamy. It had just the right amount of flavor and there was plenty for left-overs. I definitely would recommend this to those who want something good to eat but don't really want to do a bunch of work preparing dinner.
