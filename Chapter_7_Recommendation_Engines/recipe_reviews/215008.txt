We really enjoyed this! The only change that I would make when I make this again is to reduce the marinating time. I only marinated for about 10 hours before I made this and the teriyaki was a little strong for our tastes. Hubby said next time try for 5 hours. Other than that this recipe is great as is and is super fast to prep and get in the oven. Thanks Cindy!

This was so moist and tender. I made one change to make coating easier.I put the panko bread crumbs in a ziplock bag and added 2T.of olive oil and smoked paprika. Mix well without touching the crumbs.I put one piece of chicken in at a time for coating. It worked much better.

What a great flavor combination!  I only marinated for 8 hours, but that seemed to be long enough to impart the teriyaki flavor.  I'm going to try to find a low-sodium teriyaki sauce (or make my own) next time, as I found this to be a bit salty.  We had this for dinner last night and hubby actually complemented (which is rare).  This is a keeper, for sure.

This is a very original and awesome recipe.

I read the other recommendations and lowered the teriyaki marinating time to 6 hours.  You could taste the flavor very well.

I put the thighs in a gallon zipper bag and  pounded them out with a wood roller.

Then I used the same bag to marinate the meat.

I put a full slice of ham over the thigh topped it with shredded mozzarella.  A slightly stronger cheese would probably work better.

After layering the thigh, I  rolled from the larger side then used a few toothpicks, one on each end and one in the middle to lock in the cheese.

Drizzle a little olive oil on the chicken, roll them in the breadcrumbs and then top again with another drizzle of oil to crisp the breadcrumbs.

I used a rack to lift the chicken off the pan and then baked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.

This is a keeper.

This was so easy and turned out really nice.  After mine was done I added Deli mustard at my husbands request.  Surprisingly good.

OMG!!!! This was so good.  Cut the recipe to 2 servings. I ate the ham for lunch so I substituted genoa salami.  It was mouth watering good.  The next day I sliced it and ate it on a sandwich.

Thanks Cindy for this awesome recipe! It's one of my fiance's FAVORITE dishes! I don't add chili sauce, but follow the rest to a T. It's such a delicious, quick and easy meal! I make fried rice on the side and it's definitely one of my faves too! Thanks again!

These were really great.  Followed ingredients very closely, just used a slice of swiss cheese instead of the string cheese.  Instead of pounding the thighs I used one as bottom, one as the top and put the cheese and ham in between, keeping them together with toothpicks.  The chili sauce made a real difference.  These were very tender and incredibly flavorful.  Follow the recipe, no need to be more creative.  Cindy, you Rock!

These flavors just do not go together. The teriyaki and mozzarella just does not work.

This was so good!  My family, even the picky ones loved it.  I used a garlic parmesan crouton bread crumb instead of panko, only because I was out, and it was great.  I will make this again!

THIS IS OUTSTANDING! I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and it was SO flavorful. I substituted swiss cheese for the string because thats what I had in the fridge. We made country gravey to put over it as well. Cant wait to make it again!
