I made this exactly as posted and thought it was excellent! My kids love it too. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe. To others who rated this, I just want to note that if you make alterations to the recipe, it's really not fair to rate your results as you don't know how the recipe would have turned out if you made it as intended. Your low rating based on your changes or errors could cause someone else to not try a really wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe--very easy and quick to prepare. Even my husband who dislikes casseroles thought it was a winner.

Used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and sides to make this dish. Just layered everything into a large pie plate and topped with the leftover mashed potatoes and cheese. So darn good and thanks!

This was a hit at our post-Santa Bus potluck last night. After reading previous reviews I decided to tweak it a bit: 1) I added some poultry seasoning for more depth. 2) I used two packages of powdered turkey gravy blended with water (jarred gravy is e-x-p-e-n-s-i-v-e. It thickened up just fine. 3) I made and cooked the base the night before, reheated it on the stove while I made the stuffing. The base seemed a bit dry I added more water. 4) Since I used a cast iron Dutch oven, I put the whole shebang in the oven. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: There's no way this recipe serves four unless they're starving athletes. It served eight people just fine. I plan on trying this recipe again with real Thanksgiving leftovers; especially the gravy. The stuffing mix with soup and cheese was amazing! Thanks, Jenni :o)

Certainly should be good as there is nothing healthy about it.  I'd say this is a treat and nothing I'd make for my family on a regular basis.  Look at those nutritional values. Whoa...

This is a great well balanced meal.  It would also be great to freeze for busy moms.

The ingredients in here sounded like it would taste real good.  It didn't taste as great as I thought, but I'll make it again.  It was worth eating.  Thank you.

Very good!  The family loved especially my 2 year old.  I only made one change simple because I didn't have the ingridient (jar of gravy).  Still was good, and will definetely make again.

This was a great and simple recipe to use what I already had on hand.  I made this ground turkey version except we omitted the cranberries and carrots, and added poultry seasoning per someone else's suggestion.  
 **I ALSO made a VEGETARIAN version - using sauteed Quorn crumbles (with a little garlic powder and rosemary) as the meat substitute and homemade vegetarian gravy - for the gravy and for the stuffing cube mix-in (instead of cream soup).  We have meat-eaters and a vegetarian, so I'm always looking for double-duty or easily adaptable recipes.  She loved the vegetarian version, so this will be part of our regular rotation.

Great recipe especially for a cold day! I made it exactly as the recipe called for
The only exception was that I used only half the cranberries called for because that's all I had and to us it seemed to be the right amount.

Disappointing! Thought this would be a good way to use Thanksgiving left-overs. DH, who generally eats anything I make for supper, only ate a few bites. The changes I made were using shredded turkey instead of ground, using homemade dressing, and adding a bit of extra cheddar: all upgrades. This is a no repeater with no potential.

Definitely yummy!  Used frozen veggies instead of canned and prepared powdered gravy & it came out quite good.

Family liked this but definitely needs some additional seasoning to the turkey.  Overall a quick, hearty meal and I will probably make this one again.

Well...I thought this was just "Ok".  But to be fair, alot of the things I didn't like were errors on my own part.  First of all, I used the gravy packets mixed with water instead of jarred gravy...and it came out WAAAY too watery (tried thickening w/corn starch, but didn't really help).  I also scorched the top of mine...Note to self, do not walk away from the oven while it's on broil!  I'm also not a big fan of green beans, but used them anyway, and it was all I could taste!  In the future I will use less (I still like to get in the veggies...) I think this will be better with turkey cutlets, so I will try that route next time (pre-bake the cutlets).  I spread mashed potatoes on the bottom as a first layer and only used two cups of cheese, which was plenty.  I will definitley make again, keeping in mind all of these changes.  I'm really hoping this will get 5 stars next time!!
