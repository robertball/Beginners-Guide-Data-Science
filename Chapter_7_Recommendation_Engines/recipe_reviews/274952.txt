Wow this is super simple and super delicious. Definitely making again! I can’t handle spicy so the only modifications I made were to use homemade jerk seasoning with no cayenne and I omitted the jalapeño. This recipe is also 4 year old approved. Thanks!

Delicious! made it exactly by the recipe (except added some cayenne pepper because my jalapeno wasn't very spicy) used Penzeys spices jerk seasoning for the chicken. chopped the chicken up after cooking and served it with hard taco shells with some lettuce and cheddar cheese. everyone loved it, even the picky eaters!

Can't really fault this, it was fresh and delicious exactly as written. I used Brazilian Bites,  cheesy bread rolls,  to go on the side. It was great!

Turned out great, I put a large jalapeño & a pinch of Lawry’s season salt.  My wife loved it, & that’s what matters.

Excellent! Double the salsa, it's that good, just added a little honey and Olive oil to blend. Keeper!
