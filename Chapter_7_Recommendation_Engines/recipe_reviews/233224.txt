Super easy and a family favorite! I use mixed berry pie filling, double everything and use a 9×13 pan. A hit every time!

Excellent! I used Krusteaz gluten free flor which worked just fine. Also used 29 oz can of pie filling because I love cherries. That also worked just fine. Tastes fabulous and much simpler than fiddling with pie crust.

Made this the first time with fresh picked tart cherries, made my own pie filling with them.  Received rave reviews and many people said it was the best cobbler they had ever had , not from the fruit, but the cobbler portion itself.  Have since made it with peaches - also good and trying it with strawberries tonight.  Yum.  This is now the standard go to cobbler recipe in our hh.

I thought there was something wrong with the recipe. It just seemed odd to put batter on top of melted butter and then the cherries on top of that.  But I had limited ingredients so I made it anyway.  It turned out great!  I will make it again even if I have the ingredients for something more complicated.  It is probably important to use very good cherries.  I made my own cherry pie filling with fresmont morgen cherries

Easy to make, best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   jenncrowe, thanks for sharing your recipe.  I liked that this made a smaller pan.

I appear to be the lone party pooper here, but my family didn't care for this recipe.  I prepared it exactly as instructed,  with no changes or tweaks.  We found there to be an excessive amount of butter, and we thought the cobbler batter was bland and too thin (meaning, both too runny before baking, and making too thin of a baked layer vs the fruit).  My husband said, "well, at least the cherries are good...."  Those were from a can - ha!  Two stars for quick and easy preparation, though.

I almost didn't make this because it was so simple, and I traditionally like making things that are complicated and challenging.  I made only a few changes.  I used unsalted butter, so I had to add more than a pinch of salt.  I melted the butter in the baking dish while the oven was heating...  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  I cooked it until golden brown, but I preferred the dark brown crispies on the edges, so next time I would bake it just a tad beyond golden brown.  A very good tasting, easy recipe.

Super easy made with ingredients commonly found in the pantry so no shopping was required. I didn’t have pie filling however only a jar of cherries which I drained before spooning them onto the batter. I added whipping cream after it cooled. Delicious!

Ok, had to change a few things because I didn't have the exact ingredients, but it turned out great:
1. Used self-rising instead of all purpose.
2. Added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp mace, and  
1/4 cup of xylitol to cherry pie filling.
3. Used two cans of cherry pie filling instead of just one.
I know, I know, it sounds like a quite a few changes, and I supposed it is, but this is an excellent basic recipe and adapted itself beautifully to the ingredients I had on hand and to the taste of my husband and me.
I don't often make baked desserts, but this one is definitely a keeper! 
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I didn't understand why the butter would be melted in the microwave instead of in the preheating oven, so I ignored that.  This is a good recipe but more "cake-y" than "biscuit-y" as I would expect a cobbler to be.

This worked out great.  I tripled the recipe to make a large pan.  Due to that I had to adjust the cooking time to get the center baked.  Will use this gain and again.
