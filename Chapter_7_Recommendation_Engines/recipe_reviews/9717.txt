I have made these cookies twice, and they are always well-received.  I opted not to skin the hazelnuts at all - it adds more healthy fiber to the cookies.  Cooking the batter long enough for it to be slightly firm will help the cookies bake up taller and not spread out.  Adding cinnamon is also quite good.

I think this recipe is great, so simple yet very tasty.  I have tasted a similar version from one of our local Italian bakeries, and had been searching for this recipe forever.  I have added melted chocolate to the batter and it turned out quite well.  Unlike the previous poster, my cookies didn't spread at all, which to me is wrong as I think they actually SHOULD come out flat and thin.  As to the skinless hazelnuts, I chopped mine in half, in anticipation of the cookies coming out flat, and roasted them in the oven, and the skin just peeled right off.  If you like nutty cookies, this is a must try.

I was a bit disapointed in the height of the cookies, I thought they would have baked higher rather than flat. It also took alot longer than I had anticipated, since it was difficult to located filbert nuts NOT in the skin. I would have hoped for a more almond, paste tasting center.

These Italian cookies are the best. I've made them for two holiday seasons in a row now. The hazelnuts really give it a distinctive flavor and smell of the sugar in the egg white is delectable. I love the crunchy nuts and edges.     Thanks Italy. Thanks Chuck for posting. Thanks Robin for making these for me.

I love these cookies, they are some of the ones I miss most from the Italian bakeries back home in NY. I followed the directions but found that it is important to let the batter cool before spooning onto the parchment paper. Add some cinnamon or cocoa to the batter for a variation!
