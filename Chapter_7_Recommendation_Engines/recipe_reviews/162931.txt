Try adding more cheese and then rolling into balls and placing in the fridge for about 30 mins to cool and kind of solidify a bit. Then quickly dip in beaten egg white and then roll in seasoned breadcrumbs and then fry or deep fry, tastes much like the potato bites at Arbys... Yum!!!

mmm these were good.  I peeled the potatoes before boiling and didnt add cilantro, because im not a huge fan of it, but added chives instead.  I used colby cheese and it was Delicious.  I also made a green onion dip to dip these in!mmm wonderful, thank you, i now love potatoes!

These were way easier than I thought they would be.  I used 3 big potatoes and had more than 10 poofies. Loved the incorporation of the cilantro.  Cooked them in a non stick skillet so I didn' t need the butter/oil to fry them.  Pretty tasty but needed more salt after cooking...

Tasty recipe (omitted cilantro and used some herbs I had on hand), but I had a lot of problems cooking these - I don't have cooking spray on hand so used a buttered pan, but when I went to turn the potatoes, they fell apart.  Ended up just eating as mashed potatoes, which were quite good but not quite what I was going for.  May try again in the future.

The flavor f these was a little bland and they were a little dry...but dipped in ranch dressing they were great.  All five of my boys ate these, including the pickiest eater this side of the milky way and the one who doesn't like potatoes.  These get five stars from me for working a miracle at my table.

This tasted great! They didn't hold together well (they survived the first flip, but not being taken out of the pan) but I cared more about the taste. I only had mozzarella and dill (and don't much like cilantro anyway) so I substituted and YUM! I will be using this again, and probably mixing up the flavors each time. Fast, cheap, and easy to change up when you want to.

My boyfriend and I thought they were very good. Used a little milk after mashing and skipped the butter. Made more than expected. Make sure to leave plenty of room in the non stick skillet for flipping to avoid messing up the shape. Would make again.

Fun to make. I used scallions instead of cilantro because that's all I had. I added some garlic and herb seasoning. My boyfriend loved em. These are such a cute idea.

My husband loved these.  Next time I will add more salt and possibly more cheese.  Nice option for potato side.

Try cooking them in a little silver ring then you can flip the ring and they keep shape the lift ring off when on the plate that's what I did .

A little bland, even with the substitutions (green onion instead of cilantro, extra cheese, seasoned breading) so I may try to to make them again with a different spice. We had gem with sour cream on top and they are very good that way! My family liked them

They fell apart.  They took forever to make.  My step-mom recommended I add a beaten egg and flour to the remaining mixture.  And let them cook five to six minutes before flipping.  Then they worked much better.  However, the taste was rather bland and not worth all the effort.

Great tasting! Did not hold together well, but I think if you treated them more like potatoe pancakes and added a little egg and flour they could turn out nicely.

Made these tonight for dinner and they were yummy!  Even my son who doesn't like potatoes at all, liked these.  The only reason i gave 4 star is because they are bland.  It defiantly needs more seasoning.
