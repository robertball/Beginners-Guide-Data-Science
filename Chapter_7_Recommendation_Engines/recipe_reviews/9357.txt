i make half-batches of this (with 1tsp vanilla), and i have a few suggestions as well. as another reviewer suggested, i always sift together the powdered sugar and cocoa, then add the cheese mixture to the dry ingredients. i also use 1/2c walnut pieces instead of the peanuts. i spray an 8"x8" or 9"x9" pan with nonstick spray, then press the fudge firmly into it to cool. sometimes, i find it necessary to blot excess butter or grease from the top with paper towels. by the way, i have used lowfat velveeta with no problems! and one last thing: a variation i love is to substitute 1tsp cherry extract for the vanilla (again, in half batches) and 1/2c dried cherries, chopped, for the nuts -- it's always a hit for me!

This is an excellent recipe.  It makes a very smooth, creamy and chewy fudge.  It reminds me of fudge I've gotten from bakeries.  It does makes huge amounts, so halve it unless you're cooking it for a big party.  It works best if you sift your confectioners sugar and cocoa to get rid of lumps.  It's easy to make, but does require lots of stirring.  It gets stiff very quickly, so I wound up kneading it with my hands.  I took it to a party and everyone raved over it.  I do think it's best not to tell people what is in it until they've made their mind up about it.  Some people are very suggestible, and if you tell them it has cheese in it, the cheese will be all that they taste.  Otherwise, you really don't notice the cheese.  I used Velveeta and it worked nicely.  I also substituted 2 cups chopped pecans for the peanuts, and I thought that was about right.

We have made this for years -- we never cook it. We simply put it all in a big bowl and either mix it with our hands or use the mixer with a bread hook. Use no-salt butter and make sure everything is room temperature. I use half dry milk and half powdered sugar. It's not so sickly sweet that way. Make sure your dry milk is very finely granulated if you do this. Also yummy with lots and lots of chopped pecans in it. Delicious!

This makes a huge amount of very delicious fudge. I wish I had halved the recipe, because it took a very large mixing bowl and quite a while to mix in all that powdered sugar (I actually burned up the motor on my cheap hand mixer) so I recommend a large table mixer with a dough hook. The texture is to die for, though! Definitely worth it, and you can NOT taste the Velveeta.

This recipe didn't go over so well at the family get-together.  Even the kids didn't eat it.  It was very smooth although rubbery in texture.

I was very skeptical about trying this but found it to interesting to pass up.  I made it and tried it myself first and was amazed at how good it was so I took it to my family's get together for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I only made 1/2 the recipe and put it in an 8x8 dish - also left out the peanuts.  It was the easiest and probably the creamiest fudget I ever made - I'm keeping this one!

I followed this recipe to the letter but it failed.  It was a big gooey mess. I have eaten this fudge before and it was delicious so perhaps I did something wrong.  It is a cold day here in Texas and the pans I used, I sprayed with PAM to keep it from sticking.  I left it in the 'frig for 2 hours and it still would not hardened.  So back to regular fudge for me.

This is the best fudge ever and the perfect fudge texture. It's also not too sweet like some fudges. If it didn't come out good then you must have messed up when you were making it, which is hard to do since it's a really easy recipe....I hope you enjoy as much as my family and I did.

This was a very easy recipe, and the fudge is smooth and creamy. I was worried about tasting the cheese, so I did double the amount of cocoa.  I decreased the recipe by 1/2.  I changed the order of the directions, too.  First I mixed the confectioner's sugar and cocoa until well combined.  I used my kitchenaid, but it can also be done by hand with a fork.  Then in a medium saucepan, I melted the butter and processed cheese cubes over medium heat.  It seems to really separate and get stringy, but that means it's nearly done, just not yet.  I reduced the heat to medium-low, and whisked the cheese mixture for a few minutes longer.  It eventually became smooth and creamy.  Once it did, I used my kitchen-aid dough hook to mix it in with the cocoa and sugar.  I mixed it on low speed for a few minutes, until I was certain all the cocoa and sugar were mixed in.  The fudge started to look a little glossy.  I had lined a 9x13 cake pan with parchment paper (with extra to be able to pull it out of the pan by the paper).  I let it sit on my kitchen counter for about 3 hours to cool completely.  Then I cut it into 48 squares (about 1 in. x 2 in. in size).

I first found this recipe published in the Farmer's Almanac. It seemed like the best thing in the world. Fudge for taste and cheese. The one I have calls for less of everything and can be made in a large pyrex mixing bowl in the microwave. I make it every year and it never fails to impress people. I have added nuts, candy cane pieces, dried fruit and sprinkles to make it fancy. As mentioned it can need more sugar, but once you get used to the recipe you won't be able to mess it up. Pretty foolproof and you shouldn't be able to taste the cheese.

One of my favorites.  Sometimes you've got to add a little more powdered sugar, because humidity affects this recipe easily, but it's one of been making for years and one that I'll continue to make.  Because friends & family constantly request it.

I have made this for years now. I do half the recipe at a time. If you use the bag powder sugar you will not have to sift it, there is no lumps in the bags. I also mix the dry ingredients and then add the melted to it. I take a sheet of waxed paper and lay it into and up the sides of a 9x13 cake pan. Press the fudge into the pan. When I add walnuts to this I press them onto the top at this time. After it has chilled all you have to do is dump it onto a cutting board and cut into small pieces.  I find 1 inch cubes are a perfect size.

Thought I'd try something different.  This fudge is pretty good unless it's sitting next to fudge made the old fashioned way as it did at a Christmas party.  Nobody went back for seconds.

My mother used to make this and she lost the recipe. I was overjoyed to find it here! I just finished making it and towards the end, I had to start giggling - the smell is just like I remember. When I offered a taste to my boyfriend, he said, "I smell cheese (in the house), but I don't taste cheese! It's good!" He also commented that the texture is perfect, and it really is! I only made half the recipe as some other posters said, mainly because I wanted to make sure it came out right but I'm sure I'll be making the other half shortly. Quick, easy and really scrum-diddly-umptious. Yay!

I tried this recipe tonight and LOVED it!  I halfed the recipe as suggested, but it was so good I'm almost sorry I did!  I would use half of the vanilla that they suggest next time as well.  I melted the butter first, and then used Velveta slices which melted together perfectly.  I then put it in my food processor and used a dough hook.  It came out great!

Oh I love this recipe...my co-workers place orders durning this time of the year.  It is smooth and delightful.  The only person that did not truely accpet this dessert hates cheese, but she loved it at first then hated it when I told her what it was made out of.  It is very firm when you put it in the fridge over night and if you forget to put in the vanilla like I did it does not hurt and really made it better....  Great job

I highly recomend trying this, it's super fast and easy with good results. I just made this fudge and I am very pleased with the flavor and the consistency.  I halved the recipe, like every one else I was a little sceptical, but not anymore!  But I do think cutting the recipe in half made it easier to work with.  I did have to mix it with my hands because it was very stiff (I don't have a stand mixer). Just give it a chance.

Never tell anyone there's cheese in this because they chicken out.  Of those that I didn't tell, they loved it.  Excellent fudge.

I enjoy experimenting with tastes sensations and the thought of processed cheese as a fudge intrigued me.  All the rest of the fudge recipes are going to the recycle bin because this is the only fudge recipe that I will ever make again.

I make this at least four times a year and it is really the only reason Velveeta would be in my house.  I actually got this recipe about 25 years ago from a co-worker.   I have never had a batch fail.....ever.   I do two variations on this.  On the first, I substitute strongly brewed  espresso or hazelnut coffee for the vanilla and add chopped hazelnuts.  For the second, I substitute peppermint extract for the vanilla and add cracked peppermint candies or crushed Thin Mints.  (If it is Girl Scout cookie season.). I have also made the standard recipe but added craisins and chopped pecans instead of peanuts. I want to make a raspberry version but don't know what to use instead of vanilla.

Tasted like cheese.  Not even the kids would eat it.  Was embarrassing.

My family loves it.  Its fun handing a piece to someone that has never tasted it before and asking them what they think the main ingredient is. No one can ever believe its cheese!

I was the most popular girl at school when I took this in to work.  My family loved it, until they found out what was in it, but I've given the recipe out to several people at work.  They definitely have a greater sense of adventure!  The texture, flavor and ease of this fudge make it a winner!
