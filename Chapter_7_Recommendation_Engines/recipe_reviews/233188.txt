Fantastic! Since I had used the entire jar of Herdez sauce to make the marinade, I opted to reserve about 1/2 cup of the marinade before pouring it over the meat so I could baste it as it cooked. I used a good sized flank steak from Costco and after cooking, sliced it thinly. We made Chipotle style bowls with cilantro lime rice, black beans,corn salsa, avocado, and cheese. Great recipe!

I made this recipe with sliced chicken thighs and my family loved it.  I added sauteed peppers and onions to the cooked chicken and served it over cilantro lime rice.  I saved the sauce I didn't need to marinate the chicken in the Herdez cooking sauce jar and will use it on tacos or burritos.

I made this as directed but used thin cut skirt steak so it only took a total of 7 - 8 minutes.  Let the meat rest and sliced and diced it for small tacos.  It went perfectly with finely diced cilantro & onions, tortillas charred on the grill. Easy Spanish Rice and Simple Spicy Salsa - all on this site.  Look for the Herdez cooking sauce in the Mexican section - center shelf below the Tapatio sauces.  There are 4 flavors and I could recommend all of them.

Absolutely the best! I used London Broil because it was on sale an you also have to cut it cross-grain. It was so think, I did marinated overnight....best piece of meat ever! Just a touch of heat when you eat ot without the sauce. Great recipe, Janet! Thanks!

This marinade makes a very tasty steak with the perfect amount of jazz.  We enjoyed it very much.
