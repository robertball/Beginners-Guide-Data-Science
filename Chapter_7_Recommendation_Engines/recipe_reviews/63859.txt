I only had peeled diced tomatoes.  Had some left over Marinara Sauce 2 from this site.  So I used that up in this recipe.  Everything else I kept the same.  This is a very quick, easy, cheap, healthy, and yummy dinner.  My husband really enjoyed it, and ate lots of it!  Would be a five star recipe, but it is just a pasta dish.  Great, but nothing too fancy.  Next time I think I'll try throwing in some canned corn.  I think that it would taste really good in this dish (plus it would add a vegetable).

It was a lot like my mom's goulash, but not quite there

I liked this. Although the kids felt it was a little bland.

This didn't sound great, It didn't even look great, but it was surprisingly very good. It is one of my favorite pasta dishes now. It's economical and healthy. I used whole wheat noodles spaghetti noodles broken into thirds. I will be making this again.

this recipe is hearty and goes a long way, and is wonderful for a family with kids who dont like many spices. my hubby would have liked a little more kick, so we will maybe try some spices out next time. thanks for the recipe!
