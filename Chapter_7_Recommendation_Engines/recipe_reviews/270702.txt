This was so good! I substituted a couple ingredients because my lazy self wasn't going multiple places, searching for something I probably wouldn't find in my small town anyway. I used Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce and Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste from Walmart. I don't know what I would've tasted like, using the original ingredients, but I thought this was wonderful with what I had available. I'll be making it again in the future :)

This was some fantastic food. I had to find the chili crisp sauce, but we have a pretty good Asian food shop in town. I found that the sauce wasn't as hot as I'd thought it would be, so needed to use a lot more than the chili/garlic sauce I usually use.
