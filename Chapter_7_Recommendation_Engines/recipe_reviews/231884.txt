Agree with foxybirds.  Unfortunately started making it before reading your comments. Needs lots of extra spices and liquid. The chipotle potatoes give it a weird taste and a pinkish color. I won't use this recipe again.

This is no trip to flavor town. I had to doctor it up to give it flavor. I would not make this again. Considering the expense and time I am very disappointed.

I went ahead and added a 12 oz Burgundy cooking wine, and 2 fresh jalape√±os. It was hot as in spicy.  I enjoyed it. It didn't burn my throat.
