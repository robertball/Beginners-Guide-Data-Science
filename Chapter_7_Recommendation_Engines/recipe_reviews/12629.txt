So I followed the instructions and my crust was under baked and my filling was not set. I threw it back in for...15ish min. at 300. Maybe even a little longer. Left it out all night and then it was set. I did have left over filling because I didn't have a deep dish crust and I put it over ice cream. Amazing. I topped it with whip cream with a little chocolate Godiva liquor and a little sugar. I am certain it would have gone great with the pie. My dog ate the entire thing off the counter. Lame. I will have to do it again, lol.

I made this as a treat for a holiday party I hosted. Some thought it was too sweet, which I could agree with, but I liked that. It lasted quite a few days (since one slice at a time was fulfilling), which was great!

This pie is incredible, however, I did cook the crust longer, I also boiled the sugar mixture a little longer and I put the oven at 300*. I also have found that it sets up very well if you refrigerate it after it is cooked and has cooled, just know that when you heat up a slice in the microwave it doesn't take very long. This is great served with vanilla ice cream! It really does taste like a prailine. My husband's favorite!

My nine year old son made this recipe for our local 4th of July pie-baking contest last year and won a bronze medal! There was hardly any left over for us to try after all the judges had a "taste", but it was like eating carmel! He is making it again this year...hope for a gold.

Absolutely delicious! I made mini-pies in my cupcake tins and, while they needed to bake a bit longer than the recipe called for, they are amazing.  One of the best recipes I've made in a long time.

I love this pie. I had never tried praline pie and this recipe definitely made me want to try it again. Thanks!

There is something wrong with the cooking times to this recipe. The crust was very underdone I had to then cook the pie for much longer to finish off the crust. then the candy had cooked too long. i would prebake the crust longer next time

The pie was very good. The filling did bubble over some, so I would put a baking pan or something under it just in case.

After following the recipe the pie was still extremely wet.  Popped it back in the oven and cranked it up to 325.  Checked 15 minutes later and the pie had thickened quite a bit.  We decided to bake it like a Pecan Pie and were not disappointed.  It was completely  thickened by morning.  Delicious pie with a little tweaking on the baking instructions.
