If you are not into chopping veggies This is for you! I loved beef stew. Add some seasonings. I did tweak the recipe because I had a lot of errands to run. It was nice to come home to the great aroma of beef stew. I added some French bread and a salad and my hubby was a happy camper! I cooked this stew in a crockpot on high for 4 hours. I did add 2 potatoes 1 T. dried parsley 1/2 tsp. ground thyme 2 garlic cloves 1/4 tsp. of black pepper and 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt to the crockpot along with the meat. The last hour I added the bag of veggies. Season to your taste and you will love it.

We used extra beef broth instead of diced tomatoes because Hubby doesn't like tomatoes in beef stew. We also added spices to taste paprika black pepper etc. It was sure nice and easy to have the veggies already chopped. The only complaint I have is that the potatoes were mealy. I think potatoes would be better fresh and it needed more of them. This was really good otherwise.

I knew I was going to have to make a few changes to this recipe - so my 5 star review is based on the changes I made. I left my sirloin roast whole rather than cutting it into cubes. I made a rub using fresh garlic fresh rosemary salt pepper onion powder and Herbs de Provence. I drizzled a bit of EVOO over the roast and massaged the herb mixture all around. Tossed in the bag of Birds Eye Recipe Ready veggies (nice time saver) and the beef broth. I cooked it slow and low (250 degrees for 3 hours). Removed the roast and sliced. Thickened the broth with a cornstarch slurry and served over white rice. The kids didn't even complain about dinner tonight which in my house means SUCCESS!

No chopping veges is a plus in this recipe. Husband loved all the carrots. I ended up cooking a little longer as we like some of the veges softer. All in all a quick tasty dish.

It was just ok. I needed to season it...ALOT to get it flavorful. If not it would've tasted extremely bland. I served this with Grand Slam Biscuits on the side. It would've gone great over white rice.
