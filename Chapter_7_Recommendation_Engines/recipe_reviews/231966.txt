I have been making a version of this bread for years. I just wanted to say that I discovered by accident that I had left the butter out once and about 5 minutes after it had been cooking I just added a stick of butter on top and let it finish cooking.(I don't use cheese on top) OMG! I will never make it a different way because this gives the best crispy crust that everyone loved. It really takes it up a notch!

Made this for my picky husband (who literally gags at the smell or taste of broccoli) and he loved it. His exact word: "INCREDIBLE."  Every time I make this for company, my friends ask for the recipe.  They can't believe how their kids gobble up broccoli (and onions too).

Couldn't stop eating it. My husband put a little syrup on top. Our grandson ate one big piece. He loved. I used one 14 oz. box of cornbread mix (that's what I had). It worked out fine.

I made this from the Allrecipes magazine and the kids liked it a lot.  A solid kid-friendly side dish but not what I'd make for myself.  That said it was easy, loved by the kids and wasn't time consuming so that's a win.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

I made this exactly as printed in the magazine minus about 1/2 cup of the chopped onion (Feb/Mar'14). Make sure there are enough people to eat it because it really is best warm! I had over 1/2 a 9x13 pan left. It really is good. I used a chopper to chop up the broccoli for my kids. Would make a great potluck/holiday item and doubtful anyone else would bring something similar!

This is just crazy good cornbread, I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, which is already really good, and cut the recipe in half. I made it to get my 2-year-old to eat vegetables. I chopped the broccoli and onion really fine to hide them. He liked it, but I was not expecting to love it myself! The cheese, when lightly browned, makes a nice crispy crust on top. Yum!

I omitted the cheese on top the second time around, but either way you do it the finished product is great. My husband never ate broccoli until now.

Would have given 5 stars but I changed it a bit. I don't used pre-packaged food ever. I also use organic. I used a buttermilk recipe from this site, used only 2 eggs as there are 2 eggs in other recipe cooked fresh broccoli then followed this recipe. Turned out great. I would have never thought about putting broccoli or onions into corn bread, very nice result.

Made a 60 serving version of this for a local shelter using a large steam table size pan from Costco.  It was a big hit. The recipe is very forgiving.  I used two 24 oz containers of cottage cheese, 32 oz bag shredded cheddar (including one third for topping), 4 sticks butter, ten of the 8.5 oz cornbread mix, five 10 oz packs of frozen broccoli, 20 eggs & 35 oz of chopped onions.   Baked at 375 for 1 hour and then at 325 for another 30-45 minutes.  Cheese topping was overdone, so add that late in the bake time.  Note that it looks small before cooking but expands to fill the pan to the top.

I like it, but the raw onion was a little much for me.  I will make it again, but I will sauté the onion first.

I made half recipe to see how it turned out and I was sorry I didn't make a full batch.  Will DEFINITELY make this for our holiday dinners.  I will add more broccoli than the recipe called for but this was excellent!  Thank you!

I really thought my kids would love this but they didn't. On paper, it has everything that we like, but together it just didn't really work. Husband agreed that he would have preferred cornbread with a side of steamed broccoli. Oh well, thanks anyway!

I have made this dish twice; once for a work potluck and on another occasion for our family Christmas day lunch. It was a major hit on both occasions. Very moist cornbread due to the butter and cottage cheese. The broccoli in the cornbread mix provides a great flavor. Maybe the next time I'll add a can of creamed style corn...to kick it up a notch:)

This recipe is great as written. All the flavors come together tastefully. So many compliments when they were served at a party.  This will become a go-to recipe for casual gatherings.

I made these as cornbread muffins for our company potluck instead of a wide pan of cornbread  so folks could grab and go as they made their plates and it worked out perfectly. Its been a year since they made their debut and I'm now having to revisit this recipe again because these muffins have been highly requested. Everyone has been raving about them since we came back from Thanksgiving Break. Great, simple recipe!

Ok, not as good as I hoped.  Followed exactly.  Not really the fault of the recipe, but I think I am more used to the cornbread casserole I make.  I served this with ham at Christmas.  Like another reviewer said, best warm.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but also wasn't fantastic in my opinion.

My Mom made this recipe while we were in town visiting. My kids, husband, and I, devoured almost the whole pan! The best way to get our veggie hating son to eat some broccoli. She directed me here to get the recipe, and I will be making it tonight!

Oh my so good!! Made some changes due to what I had on hand. Used full block of cream cheese to replace cottage cheese.  I used fresh vegetables, but didn't have enough broccoli so added some califlower (about half and half).  Family loved, loved!

This is now my go to dish whenever I have to make something for a gathering. I have made it exactly as written and I have made it with minced dried onions which didn’t change the flavor of the dish. I just made a batch and forgot my cottage cheese, I added milk and extra cheddar cheese instead. Hopefully it will still be as good!

I made half of the recipe. I did saute the onions in a little olive oil before adding them in as someone else suggested. My daughter is kind of picky and to my surprise she loved it!  I will make it again. Thank you for something new to try.

Moist cornbread -yay!  I did substitute sour cream for the cottage cheese because I didn't have that.  Turned out great!  Best when warmed with butter.  Will be making this again.

Very delicious recipe. I  liked how moist it was and it used less butter than some I find in church cookbooks.  It's become hard to find chopped broccoli in the area I live in. No big deal because I have a food processor. Wondering though, if anyone has tried this with chopped spinach.

I made this recipe as written, except that I  accidentally bought cottage cheese with pineapple!  It worked just fine, and I never tasted the pineapple.  I made this for a holiday dinner and got rave reviews.  It came out more crumbly than some other corn bread variations I have made, but it was moist and delicious.  Even the kids at the table ate it!

I liked this but the corn bread/muffin mix ingredient stumped me.  I live in Kamloops BC and couldn't find any here in the grocery stores. I improvised and mixed equal parts flour and cornmeal along with baking pwd and soda plus salt and sugar.  It came out quite heavy but flavourful.  If someone could convert the mix package to a recipe for me that would be awesome.

This was Great!  Made it for a girls day and it went fast.  Has everything you need, the sweetness of the cornbread, the salty of the cheese and what goes better with cheese (sure lots of things) than broccoli???  Win/Win will definitely make again

I made the recipe as written (except I mistakenly used all of a 16-oz bag of broccoli, which might have  given the cornbread too much moisture), and it was a flavorful addition to our eggs-and-bacon brunch. Next time I make it, I will fry the onions a little first; I don't do well with raw onions, and the baking time isn't  quite sufficient for them to lose their bite. Also, for my family, more cheese is in order.

The cottage cheese sounds weird but you would never know it was added at the end. I added 12 oz of broccoli as opposed to 10. Replaced  1/4 cup butter with butter flavored shortening. Used a box of jiff and the rest self rising cornmeal, because it's what I had. Tasted great!

I tried making an improvised broccoli cheese cornbread a couple months ago and it was so-so. I made it again using this recipe (as my base) and it turned out much better! The onion is the secret must-have!  I got away with 4 Tbsp butter and only 2 eggs. Didn't have cottage cheese so I used about 2 cups of homemade dairy kefir & whole milk.  This was an excellent side to my white bean chicken chili!

This is more of a corn pudding rather than cornbread.  I cooked this in a preheated cast iron skillet which is the preferred method of baking cornbread for a crispy crust.  It has a good flavor but not the cornbread texture I expect.

Excellent version of cornbread. Next time I will add some jalapeños to it for some kick.
