Let me start by saying that Herdez sauces are limited where I live and pasilla peppers are also non-existent so I substituted a tbsp. of minced chipotle in adobo sauce. I also used my own pumpkin puree and topped with sour cream. This was a very interesting soup for us as we've never tried anything "mole" before. Glad we did and I will be looking for more mole recipes! I am going to order some ground pasilla pepper because I am anxious to try this as written. Thanks BigShotsMom. We will be making this again:)
