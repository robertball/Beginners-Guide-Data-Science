A quick and easy recipe for a refreshing low-cal salad substitute. Great to fix ahead of time for that family cookout. Stays fresh in the fridge for days.

I didn't have cabbage on hand, so i used red and green peppers, onion, carrots, and canned corn.  Mixed up the dressing and tossed.  It was delicious.  I may make my salads like this more often!!!

This salad was terrific!  I used a whole medium sized head of cabbage and a whole jalapeno pepper diced very fine.  There was plenty of dressing.  Husband absolutely loved it but it was just a bit too spicy for me.  Will use a little less jalapeno next time but there will definitely be a next time!

This was very good.  I was looking for a crunchy summer salad with lots of antioxidant ingredients that was filling, had no oil, and was low in calories.  This definitely fits the bill.  Followed recipe exactly except for jalapeno - used just a tad only because I'm not a fan of really spicey hot food.

Great twist on coleslaw.  Loved the addition of corn to this and the jalapeño added just enough kick without overpowering the other flavors.  I used bagged slaw rather than shredding cabbage and used 1/4 cup sugar rather than Splenda.  My family and my parents really enjoyed this recipe.

This was excellent! I used sugar and cut way back but only due to personal preference. This is a perfect summer side dish. All of the different colors in this made it very appealing and "easy on the eyes". Thanks for sharing!

We consistently try new recipes for coleslaw and always come back to this one.  It's fabulous for a picnic as it is not only healthy but contains no mayo to worry about spoiling.

Omitted the hot pepper. Omitted the corn too, added some radishes and green bell peppers from the garden. Very tasty, kids helped and loved it. Great for low fat!

I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon of stevia. It was too spicy for me with the jalapeno. My husband like the spiciness, but thought it was too sweet. Was great for taking on a picnic, though. Held up all day! Thanks!

Very good. The cilantro and jalapeno add a little bit of an exotic flavor, which really elevates this recipe. Do note that if you use some form of liquid sweetener, you will need at least 1 1/2 teaspoons. I used closer to a full tablespoon. Don't make the mistake of using 1/3 cup of liquid sweetener, as I nearly did, before catching myself.

I didn't like the chemical taste of artificial sweetener (used Stevia).  Also - too much dressing.   Next time I will use sugar & cut back on the quantity of the dressing.   Also - used whole jalapeno - we def didn't find it too spicy!

So easy to make! I don't like coleslaw with mayo so this was perfect. I love the addition of other veggies, it makes it look like a rainbow. I use regular sugar, just a little less than the recipe calls for with UNSEASONED rice vinegar. It tastes even better if you make it the night before. Sometimes I use broccoli slaw with it as well.

Love it.  The second time I made it I used champagne vinegar as I thought I was out of rice vinegar.   That version was a bit tangy!  Did not use jalapeños but I must add that the fresh cilantro is what seals the deal.

Very good!  I used prepacked coleslaw mix and had to sub apple cider vinegar (because I didn't have enough rice vinegar)  I used real sugar, but reduced the amount to 3 TBS, which was PLENTY sweet.  Added a TBS of rice bran oil as well.  Loved the corn and jalapeno in it!

I wasn't impressed with it. While eating it I smelled a strange oder. It wasn't the vegetables as they were fresh. It must have been the Splenda. I've never used it before so that might be it. Won't be making it again.

I thought this was pretty good coleslaw.  I used part sugar and part sweetener, much less than 1/3 cup and it tastes plenty sweet.  The store had bags of coleslaw mix for $1 so I used about 5 cups of that plus the red pepper, black pepper, some finely minced red onion and a tiny bit of olive oil.

This is a great recipe.  I altered by eliminating the corn and the optional ingredients and adding poppy seeds to the dressing.  It got rave reviews!

I can't wait to try this.  The reviews look good and it has such tasty ingredients, no added fat, not too much salt and lots of fiber.  I'm always looking for dishes like this.  No wonder I'm a vegetarian, I love salads and fortunately they're good for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just used cabbage, bell pepper, and corn, and it was good.  Used 1/4 c sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I chopped the cabbage but my husband thought I should have shredded it.  I kind of liked it chopped.

Awesome.  Even the dh, who doesn't really like veggies, said it was good.  That says a lot.  I substituted half and half red and regular cabbage.  I also used stevia instead of Splenda.

So simple & so good!  Left out the corn & cilantro and it was still great!  I fully expected this to be just "blah" (especially since I didn't have any cilantro to put in it) - but pleasantly surprised.

Substituted w/ 1/4 cup sugar.  This is delicious and great to take to get togethers or just enjoy with the family. Everyone gave rave reviews!
