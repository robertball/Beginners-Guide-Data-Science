When my father in law died, we received 2 large baskets of fresh fruit.  However, none of us really eat much raw fruit, so I decided to make a fruit salad with part of it to tempt appetites.  We left out the celery because my husband doesn't like it.  It was really good.  Well worth the trouble to cut up the fruit, and people did eat it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice, easy, light fruit salad.  Used Driscoll organic raspberries rather than blackberries.  Not a fan of the seeds in blackberries.  Used a honey crisp apple for better flavor.  Used Siggi Vanilla Triple Cream yogurt for the sauce but did not mix in the salad.  Set to side so people could add what they wanted and used 12 oz instead of 8.  Made for a friend who just had surgery and she loved it.  Will make again.

I love fruit and yogurt salads for dessert, breakfast, snack...anytime! This one is delicious and can be easily adjusted for whatever fruits or yogurt you have on hand. I especially like the crunch from the celery and walnuts in this fruit salad. If you have the time, it would be nice to toast the walnuts.

I just made some of this today. I used Dannon, but found it a bit sweet. I might try another brand next time. I am going to test it with adding some of the berries and oranges next time. I keep all sorts of fruits in my fridge. I think I will opt out on the celery though. This is a nice change to the fruit, yogurt, and granola parfaits.
