I have been making these for over 20 years and they are always a crowd pleaser. I triple this recipe as this one would not even get my household started. I also add 1 tablespoon of worstershire to the softened cream cheese. I strip a layer off the green onions and use mostly the white part. I make the roll ups then refrigerate them for about 30 minutes before cutting. Much less mess. They can be eaten alone or served on Ritz crackers.

Very tasty.  I added the chopped onions directly to the light cream cheese along with some dry italian dressing from the packet.  It adds a lot of flavor.  Easy to make and the filling can be made ahead of time.  Chilling them before serving is recommended to help them stay firm so they're easier to pick up.

I threw a couple tablespoons of homemade dry ranch dressing into a bowl with the cream cheese and whipped it. I needed less than half the cream cheese mixture for five pieces of ham. The kids and I thought this was great. I think had I not added the dry ranch dressing mix, it would have been bland.

Tried this for a Housewarming Party.  Used chive and onion creame cheese and topped with a green olive.  They were gobbled up quickly.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the tips.

My mom used to make these when I was a kid.  Another easy way to make them is to use the Garlic and Herb cheese spread.  They are wonderful this way also,and less work!!

these are awesome.  The recipes is a favorite and often requested when we have snack foods for a get together.  Instead of wrapping the onion, I chopped them and mix them into the cream cheese mixture.

Fast, easy and tasty, what more do you want.  You can dress them up by adding spices and shredded cheese.  They are very good though.

These ham rolls were delicious.  My family munched on these before Thanksgiving Dinner.  I chopped up the green onions and sprinkled a few on each roll.  They were so easy to make.  I would let the cream cheese sit in room temperature for about an hour before spreading.  Definitely a winner!!!

Excellent and easy! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of these. I ended up chopping up the green onion and sprinkling it on instead of wrapping the ham around it. I also used low fat cream cheese and it was still awesome.

These things are so delicious. I LOOK for reasons to make them. There are some recipes that call for pickles, but the green onions are the only way we make them. We little labor involved ... cleaning the green onions ... but the results are mouth watering. Wish I had some right now.

I also have been making these for years - they are a staple for every party and even when I double the batch there are no leftovers.  Add a dash of Worchestire and garlic for a little kick.  I'm asked for the recipe all the time!

This is a great snack for a party, served standing upright in a short, wide drinking glass. Experiment with any type of deli meat you prefer.

This was really good.  I wanted to stretch the cream cheese mixture a little further so I stirred in 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I used turkey slices and patted them dry before spreading the filling. These treat were gone in no time.

I added a tbsp or two of chutney to the cream cheese for a delicious appetizer.  Gave it a little more zing.

This is a good starting recipe, but I added a few spices to make it better. I added garlic powder, onion powder, and Accent Seasoning. I omitted the green onions because I am not a fan of them.

I used sliced ham from the deli, Hawaiian rolls, and regular onion instead of dried. These were very popular at a recent party, with several people asking for the recipe. I brushed on the topping and had no issues with it staying on. This is a keeper!

This recipe just comes together well.  Its so simple and great, yet you can modify it as you like.  I did several versions on a platter.  Its a great way to serve different pickles you've found or received as gifts, from okra to green beans.  We did slivers of the scallions paired w/the pickles.  We also flavored the cream cheese (that's a great place to sprinkle in some chopped chives or other fresh herbs.)  You just won't believe how tasty this recipe is!

Yum! Like other reviewers, I like to add a littlesomething to the cream cheese, usually just worcestershire sauce. Instead of chives, I prefer pickle.

This is an easy recipe. I use it with ham slices, cream cheese, and chives. I have used Philadelphia green onion and chives soft cream cheese spreads that's usually for bagels. Works great. It also helps for the ham to be dried on paper towels. I roll them up and cut into 1 inch pieces.

Good basic recipe. I use thinly sliced black forest ham from the deli and use 'whipped' cream cheese. I sometimes add fresh herbs from the garden: chopped cilantro, parsley.

I remember my mom making these when I was little.  They are so good and so easy to make.  I've also used dried beef and turkey instead of ham.

I used low-salt ham (thin slices) and light cream cheese. Very good and very, very easy. Will definitely make this one again.

I make a similar recipe in which you replace the green onions with pickeled aspagus (from Costco).  They always all go!

I've loved this recipe for years.  I add 1/2 tsp. Worchester sauce to the cream cheese and blend it smooth before spreading on the ham, to add a little zip.

Great little snack. Made as is but would like to try chives and onion cream cheese topped with green olives as another reviewer suggested.

An oldie-but-goody!  I sometimes sprinkle a little garlic powder over the cream cheese layer for extra flavor.  I've never tried the pickle idea... sounds tasty!

Would definitely add Worcestershire, pickles, or ripe olives but all together very nice recipe, also you should make my picture your google thumbnail. It’s Got a beautiful farmhouse cutting board with beautiful vintage dishes displaying the finished product ?? I used jadeite and Delphite ??

I would definitely add ripe olives to the cream cheese (like I saw on other recipes) and possibly a little bit of the green onions chopped on top of the ones you role in already ..  would definitely give it more of a taste and maybe even prettier

I went to a party where these were served, and I really really liked them.  The ham, onion, cream cheese combo is tasty. So simple to make and lots of room for variation.

These are really good if you use chopped green onions. About 1 pound of sliced deli ham will use 1 box/package of cream cheese. Adding tiny pieces of chopped jalepeno or bell pepper work really well also.

Have made these for  close to 40 years - difference is I make them using green or black olives (not everyone likes both).  Not fond of the onion, though.

Easy and delicous!!! Try adding a green olive to the top of the roll after cutting into bite size pieces; secure w/a toothpick. This is always a hit for parties.

Tasted good, but was so messy to make and eat! I tried making them with less/more cream cheese.More tasted better but the cream cheese oozed out too much.With less, all i could taste was onion.I won't make these again, unless I can figure out what I did wrong.

My aunt made this recipe for my Bridal Shower. It was different but very good :) She actually used pickled asparagus and baby dill pickles instead of onions. Yumm!!!
