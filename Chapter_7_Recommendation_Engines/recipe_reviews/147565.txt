This is my new favorite salad -- used all spinach instead of basil and used fried choped up bacon instead of prosciutto -- You never can go wrong with bacon --  there is never any left over and I always have left over pasta salad.  You can leave out the nuts and it is still wonderful.

I'm a firm believer about rating a recipe as it was written. It drives me nuts when people rate a recipe after they've made a million changes to the recipe.  So with that being said, I think this recipe is delicious as written.  I think next time I make it, I'll cut back on the olive oil.  But other than that, this recipe was a hit with the fam and company.  I love it served cold as well.  After trying this recipe, I don't think I'll ever go back to making the traditional pasta salad - thanks for sharing Jennifer

Really enjoyed this one.  The first time I made it I followed the advise of some reviewers and added Italian dressing.  I thought the flavor was rather generic so I made it again so I could get taste of it's intended flavor.  I MUCH prefer to follow the recipe exactly than to alter the dressing.

Absolutely fabulous, followed the recipe to the letter, and it was awesome. The basil was wonderful, it was sort of a deconstructed pesto, yum!

This salad was awesome.  I made it to bring to a Sunday dinner at my in-laws, and they were all asking me for the recipe.  At first when I put it all together, I tasted it and didn't think it was all that special, but after I got there, and stirred in the nuts and the parmesan cheese, and the dressing flavors had had time to blend, it was actually really delicious.  I agree with someone else that said it is very expensive to make, so I did substitute the pine nuts for slivered almonds, but even still, everything else added up too.  It does make a lot though, and I think you could substitute the priscioutto for a less expensive meat as well, but I wouldn't leave it out completely, it does add some extra flavor and texture to have some kind of meat in there.  Overall, we loved it!!

I think this was the best pasta salad i have ever had! I added more herbs and a little bit of dry ranch dressing mix and left out the prosciutto, because we didn't have that on hand. But it was just perfect!

Delicious! Generously salt the pasta water and you shouldn't need to add more salt later, the parmesan cheese adds salt too, so be careful. I also used twice the spinach the recipe called for to get more veggies. Three kids under 13 and my husband all loved it. Luckily there is a tiny bit of leftovers for lunch tomorrow =)

Excellent pasta salad. My husband dislikes most pasta salads but liked this one. I added black olives and a little itallian dressing.  I also added extra pine nuts and cheese. MMMMMMmmmm.

This was absolutely the BEST pasta I have ever had.  Using all the ingredients - just like the recipe called for was EXPENSIVE....but I am almost convinced that it is worth it.  I had never eaten Pine Nuts....and had trouble finding them in the grocery store - they were located with the fresh fruits & vegetables.  ENJOY this - it is really good.

This salad is awesome! I even made it as a side for Christmas dinner. It's very colorful and pretty, as well as delicious. If there is any left over (and don't count on that happening often) it makes a great lunch.

This makes the most amazing spinach salad.  We have a salad with every meal.  We use our homemade basil/olive oil/garlic/old bay salad dressing with some fresh tomatoes and wow!.  Thank you Jennifer...

This recipe is great.  I did make a few changes though:  I didn't have any bowtie pasta so I just used whole grain ciabatta bread.  Instead of spinach and basil I decided to use romaine lettuce and instead of the prosciutto, I substituted roasted turkey.  I'm not a big fan of pine nuts, and I'm allergic to parmesan, so I used ketchup and mustard.  I was in a hurry so I left out the salt and pepper.  Next time, I think I'll leave out the garlic because it was a bit too garlic-y.  Other than that, it turned out GREAT.  Thanks Jennifer!

Very good.  Love the fresh basil and pine nuts.  I think this would also be good with bacon instead of proscuitto.

Excellent!  I was missing the basil, which is upsetting--I love basil!--and parmesan cheese, but I really wanted to eat this for lunch so I forged ahead.  I used a tiny bit of goat cheese instead of parmesan and left out the basil and it was still wonderful.  I'm sure it would be even more wonderful with basil. I made it more like a green salad with lots more spinach, some tomato, and a little italian dressing.  So good and so easy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I do like this pasta salad, its light and healthy to me. Although i changed alittle ingredients, didn't really like bow tie pasta, i didn't have at home anyway, so just used what i have, then i used bacon instead prosciutto, cause me and my husband love bacon so much, and its always right with any kind of salad, and also i used walnuts.. Its just so right together.. love it.

This dish is great---both light and satisfying! I did change it up a bit though. After I cooked the oil, garlic, and prosciutto, I threw in the spinach, basil, pine nuts, and some lemon juice (2-3 tbls) and cooked them all together for 5-6 minutes. I know the recipe calls for uncooked spinach and basil. But, I preferred it better cooked. As such, I doubled the amount of spinach I used in the dish as well (6 ounces just wasn't enough). Make sure you don't add any more salt--the prosciutto has plenty!! Great reheated too!!

I love this recipe!  I have prepared this at least 10 times since first finding it on the website. I follow the recipe exactly, minus the pine nuts because they are so expensive. Even my very picky husband likes this salad.

Great as a side or a stand alone meal!  So simple and absolutely delicious!  For a cheaper version, I occasionally substitute ham for prosciutto.

This is a delicious mix!  Very simple to make and super tasty...the kind of salad you might find in a very chic and good New York restaurant! Great to bring to a party or serve to guests or to serve to family at home. I used Black Forest smoked ham instead of prosciutto and it worked perfectly.  The bow ties don't cook for 12 minutes...just follow the package directions for that. Tres tres bon!

The best tasting pasta salad! I too used bacon rather than Prosciutto and I did end up picking out a lot of the basil and spinach leaves, for some reason it just seemed to much to me. Will definetely make again.

Love it - doesn't really need meat though, it's perfect without.  I have made this so many times now - we have it as dinner, not as a pasta salad.  It's just that good.

Sorry, but we found this recipe very bland.  I did end up adding redwine vingar and salad seasoning to try and spice it up a little. I think some onion and maybe feta cheese might help.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe very closely (less basil only due to lack of it).  Will definitely make again!  Thanks.

Very easy pasta to make.  However, I found it to be a little bland.  Might make a nice side if you have a very flavorful main dish.

I thought this was a great base recipe! The original recipe looks really good but I was on a budget and I didn't have prosciutto, pine nuts, or enough parmesan on hand, so I did make changes. My version came out good, so I figured I would share for those who want a vegetarian option. I didn't have bow tie pasta, so I used Barilla whole grain rotini. I used a 9 ounce package of spinach and I added 2 cloves of garlic. I skipped the prosciutto, salt and pepper, pine nuts, and the parmesan. Instead, I added a can of chickpeas (rinsed), a can of black olives (rinsed), and 1 cup of Athenos tomato basil feta for a salty flavor. I followed the cooking directions and it came out really great. I'm excited to try the original next time!

Delicious recipe! I added some grilled chicken & served this to my family as a one-dish meal tonight - they loved it & asked me to make it again...often! Made a few minor changes, improvising with the ingredients I had on hand - I used about half of the olive oil called for, substituted the prosciutto for 2 pieces of bacon and added some sauteed onions & little cream before tossing all together. Also I had to skip the Parmesan cheese, but I'm sure that would have made it even better!

It is truly a great recipe.  Had to change a few things first had to use wheat penne pasta, didn't have pinenuts, used 3 slices of bacon instead of prociutto.  But the basics were there will make it again and again.

Great pasta salad.  Everyone loved it and I forgot to buy the prosciutto.  I also thought that less oil could be used.

I am one of those horrible people as mentioned above in reviews...due to allergies...
I changed the recipe...

I did not add pine nuts I used Italian Basil but less and Frozen Chopped Spinach and Minced Garlic in Olive Oil with Parmesan from Can...all I had and pasta was spirals did have to add a touch of Italian dressing

I substituted tuna for the prosciutto and had to substitute mustard greens for spinach because it was not available that day. I didn't add the parmesan, but put it on the table for each person to add his or her own. My son loved it and took the leftovers for lunch.

Awesome. I used shaved proscuitto which it doesn't specify. I tried getting it at the deli sliced thick in then dicing it but it wasn't as tender. Also added a bit more oil at the end so it wasn't too dry.  I'll make this again & again & again.....

I never write reviews but this was just too good not to comment! I made it exactly as written, and not only was it delicious but it looked beautiful too. I didn’t measure the basil, so I probably didn’t use the full amount, but I definitely wouldn’t skip it, as it adds a very distinct flavor. As other reviewers pointed out, it’s not a cheap salad, but it makes enough to feed a big crowd. Also, unlike many green salads, it’s not a bad leftover the next day. Enjoy!

A wonderful  alternative to an Italian dressing based pasta salad which I found looking for a way to use a bumper crop of basil. I used ham instead of  prosciutto and slivered toasted almonds for the pinenuts to keep the cost down.  Then I followed the directions as written.  I suggest having the pasta very cold and assemble this right before you're going to serve.

The whole basil leaves are just too strong for our taste. I would change it up by using less, and slicing them up into strips. This would allow a basil flavor without overpowering the dish. I would also cook and spinach and basil for a minute or two instead of just relying on the hot oil mixture to wilt it.

This is now a go to receipe!!!  No one complains, I use 1lb of trimmed bacon.  I snip the bacon and ditch the fattiest bits, fry it then drain on towels, drain the pan and then dump in the tomatoes, garlic....then put the bacon back in.  Then put the spinach on top.  I tried the spinach with the pasta water but it was a mess for me so I just load it on top of the tomato bacon stuff and put the lid on the pan....Kids prefer with parmesean, Husband and I prefer feta.  I've also added marinated artichokes and mushrooms.  The possibilities are endless with this one.!  Prefer penne pasta per the recipe and some nice crusty warm bread.  This is a great weekday meal!

This is a simple and tasty recipe. I love this dish because I can prep it ahead of dinner and it saves me time. I like the basil, it adds alot of flavor. I also used bacon instead of prosciutto, and added cherry tomatoes and chickpeas.

This is super tasty! I omitted the prosciutto just due to preference, added an extra clove of garlic and about 1/2 cup more basil. Fantastic! Family and friends loved it. Have made it 3 times already in just a few weeks. Simple, but scrumptious!

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I used large shells instead of bowties, and swapped out the proscuitto for diced lean chicken kolbassa, went a bit light on the olive oil and added a small tablespoon of white cheddar & parmigiano dip to the skillet. Also added a bit of worschester sauce to the skillet as well. Very light and simply delicious, both of us went back for a second helping :)

What a hit with my family! My grown daughter stopped by and wasn't  planning to stay for dinner. She changed her mind when she saw what I was making. The only thing I changed was I substituted bacon for prosciutto.  Wow! This was soooo delicious! We all tried it with no dressing first, other than the warm olive oil garlic drizzle. We decided to add a little Italian salad dressing and enjoyed it. My daughter enjoyed it immensely and said she almost cried it was so good. She hadn't eaten  a home-cooked meal in a while. My husband had 3 helpings. Definitely a do-over in our house. I marinated and grilled some chicken and served it with that. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This salad is fantastic! I've made it twice and each time have received so many compliments.  I did switch to slivered almonds (toasted) and turkey bacon.  The cook time for the turkey bacon was longer than 2-3 minutes- closer to 8-10 and it was tough to keep the garlic from getting to dark.  But the garlic did get so nicely browned that it crumbled apart in your mouth in the salad- so delicious.  Great recipe- thanks Jennifer!

Like some of the other reviewers I added chicken and extra garlic.  I also substituted arugula for the spinach since I prefer it over the spinach.

I did not edit this recipe at all and I cannot say that very often.  I was worried it wouldn't be flavorful enough but it was wonderful.  Even my boyfriend (who was skeptical while I was making it) loved and I had to cut him off so I had some left to take to my work picnic.  Thanks for this, it will be a new regular!

Just added some sun dried and fresh tomatoes.  Brought this to a picnic.  Put the Parmesan in at home but saved the pine nuts and some extra basil to add just before serving as both are affected by being in moisture too long.  This was a hit.

I made this salad tonight.  It was great.
Even our picky eaters liked it.  That says 
a lot.  Five stars.  The fresh basil and pine
nuts were pricey but I grew my own spinach.
Very enjoyable salad.

I made this exactly as written and served it warm with baked chicken.  It was wonderful.  The recipe maked a huge batch so for a potluck the next day I added about 1/2 of fresh lemon juiced and stirred in a little balsamic dressing.  Topped with sliced tomatoes.  Very tasty and lots of compliments.

This is a never fail recipe, everytime it's made guests just adore it, just goes to show it's the simple things that always taste the best. I've swapped out the proscuito for smokey bacon when I didn't have any and it still tastes great....delish!!!!

Totally awesome!  Found this recipe 2 weeks ago, we've had it for dinner 3 times already!  Love it!  I did half the olive oil the and double the garlic for our family's taste, and at 1/4 c. oil thought that it had enough oil.  Just for a healthier adjustment.

Very nice recipe!  I used salami, as I had no prosciutto, and I subbed slivered almonds for the pine nute.  The kids liked it, and asked me to make again.  Nice nutty garlic flavor :)

I reduced the amount of pasta, but kept everything else the same. This was awesome! Spend the money to use pine nuts and prosciutto. The flavors are perfect.

Delicious! I made several changes, some kind of by accident (the store didn't have some things, etc.) and some on purpose...firstly I wanted a vegetarian dish so I omitted the prosciutto, and added some quartered grape tomatoes. I reduced the olive oil by about 1/4 (I was making a double batch and used 3/4 cup instead of 1). I didn't have nearly enough basil, and it really would have been nice to have more -- but 2 cups of basil (or 4 for doubling like I was trying to do) is EXPENSIVE, and it was still great with less. I couldn't get pine nuts so I substituted toasted almonds. They were good but I think the pine nuts would have been even better. Pretty sure I upped the garlic too -- it was kind of hard to measure because I had the tiniest cloves I've ever seen.

This has gotten RAVE reviews each time I have made it. Both occasions were for a large group and everyone wanted to take it home. The second time I made it,  I subbed Black Forest ham due to the cost and availability of prosciutto. The latter made it a little saltier. I put the wedges of cheese in my food processor and processed until the cheese resembled large bread crumbs. I find the cheese tastes so much better if you grate it yourself. The basil and spinach combo mixed with the flavors of garlic and ham is a winner and a crowd pleaser. This is now my go to side for big events!

Followed recipe exactly.  Would definately make it again.  Loved it warm.  Was not sure if that was how it was suppose to be served.  Will try it cold and see which way we like it better.

I have made this many times over the years..I have served it piping hot, room temperature and cold.  I have added sun dried tomatoes in place of prosciutto and I often use walnuts in place of pignolis.  Tonight I am making it with sliced grilled turkey sausage, peppers and vidalia onions. I will probably throw them all together.  It's always a favorite. Thank you!

Love all the ingredients, especially the basil. But when I tasted it it was a little lacking in flavor. I followed recipe as written. That being said, I added some homemade vinaigrette and  that did the trick. Very good

This was awesome.  I didn't have any prosciutto so I used chicken bacon, but otherwise followed it exactly.  I will definitely make this again.

I was looking for a lighter pasta salad, nothing with mayo- I love this salad. I can't have garlic, so I left that out. I used avocado oil instead of olive oil- I will definitely make this again. The whole family loved it.

I made it as the recipe stated and loved it! FYI, sizes of all items have been reduced in the grocery store so I just used what the grocery store carried (ex. 12 oz box of pasta vs recipe required 16 oz.) and everything turned out great!

This recipe is so flavorful! I used a spiral noodle just for a different look. I added "salt to taste" but shouldn't have because the prosciutto and parmesan had the perfect balance.  I didn't find diced prosciutto so I used the thinly sliced and chopped it up. My store was out of fresh basil so I used a tube of the blended basil and doubled the spinach which was still delicious. This is an expensive receipe so be sure you make it for folks who will truly appreciate it!

Delicious pasta, but pretty expensive. I forego the basil, prosciutto, and pine nuts and add pecans, bacon and some extra spinach. I also like to add halved cherry tomatoes in with the spinach to cook.

This pasta was delicious. So simple & fresh. I made the recipe as is minus pine nuts since I didn't have any. Was delicious without them . Definitely a keeper. Everyone loves it. Was a big hit at our dinner gathering.

Amazing - making it again in another day it was that good.   Only thing I did different was I misread the instructions and added almost all the oil to the cooled pasta and then put it in the fridge.   I only reserved a bit as some reviews said it was too much oil.  When it was time to add the proscuitto I realized I forgot to fry it - so fried it in remaining oil with garlic - and fried for 10+ minutes to get it crispy.   I agree with other reviews - I would cut back on the oil 10 - 20% -  after everything has a chance to blend you will find that there is extra oil.  GREAT recipe!

Simple and fast! Tastes great as written, Use a good quality Parmesan cheese. Only reason I made was a visit to the local produce shop had a bunch of basil as large as a head of romaine for a buck and a half, gonna go back for more.

Oh my goodness, so good. I only changed the meat to bacon and didn't use nuts since my husband's not a fan. It is delicious.  I love that the flavor is from simple ingredients and would not add to it. I am glad that we had a small crowd and I get the leftovers tomorrow! Also I did make it 2 hours ahead of time and refrigerated it and then added the cheese. Just my preference to have the flavors settle a bit with pasta salad. I'm just sorry summer's almost over and I won't have as many chances to make it.

We just tried this tonight. My 11 year old asked when we could have it again. My 14 year old ate three helpings. We loved the flavors and I loved how simple and easy this was to throw together. I served it warm and thought it was great. I cut the oil to 1/4 of a cup and that was more than enough for us. I mixed the basil, spinach, garlic, prosciutto,  and oil together and then poured the warm pasta over it and mixed that all together. Then I put a towel over the bowl and let the pasta wilt the spinach and basil a bit. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for a family meal one evening, and sent the leftovers home with my son and his family.  When I picked up my grandson from swim team practice a few days later, I offered to take him out for lunch.  He asked me if I could make that 'great salad' because his dad had eaten all of the leftovers.  I gladly complied, and have made it several times since.

This salad was a huge hit with my husband. It's really good and I'll definitely make it again. I halved the recipe because it's only the two of us, but I should have made the whole thing because there were almost no left-overs. I did use bacon instead of pancetta, because that's what I had in my fridge. It worked really well. Once I cooked the garlic in the olive oil, I poured it over the chopped spinach and chopped basil, which softened it. I did use toasted pine nuts, although I didn't have quite enough in my fridge. I loved this salad.

I'm a first time herb grower : starting out with pots of basil, rosemary & chives on our deck.  I came across this recipe while searching for basil recipes. I used chopped raw almonds instead of the pine nuts.  I cooked them slightly with the garlic & prosciutto.  I served this salad to my family, as an entree accompanied by slices of fresh apples & pears.  It was yummy !!!  I could see this on the menu of a fancy restaurant.

This is a big salad. My timing was off but I enjoyed the flavors. I'd prefer the recipe advise what to do with the greens. We left spinach whole and coursely chopped the basil.

I really enjoyed this. The only changes I made was to use all spinach and no basil as I'm not a fan of basil and I probably used 8 ounces of procuitto and I didn't toast the pine nuts. I will definately make this again.

Delicious !!  I didn't have pine nuts, so added pine cones instead.  (Just kidding- people are so craYz with their substitutions). I did use walnuts and added some asparagus that I tossed in briefly after the prosciutto was sautéed. Yum!  Also used a mix of spinach, kale and beet greens with the basil because that is what I had.

Very, very tasty!!! Used penne pasta instead. Also I didn't have prosciutto, but bacon filled in pretty well. I used the bacon fat to sauté the garlic, other than that I followed the recipe as suggested. My husband loved it! I can see this being tasty too with some sun dried tomatoes. I forgot to take a photo...we ate it all!!! Next time!

This recipe is very good. Since I had to reduce the yield for 2 people, I used a little less of the oil and instead rectified it when I was mixing the ingredients at the end. Very good! It is a keeper. Maybe next time I will use black truffle infused olive oil to give a bit of a different flavor. I served the salad with broiled chicken seasoned in the Greek Style Chicken Breast from this website. It turned out very good mix!

I could eat this a couple times a week!  We use 2 packages of pancetta and make it a meal.  Best served warm and you can reheat in the toaster oven.  Awesome recipe!

This was better the second day after making....but the spinach started to get a little soggy by the third day LOL.  All in all an easy dish to whip up for a party and it was pretty good....I would actually rate it 4 1/2 stars if we could do 1/2 stars b/c I think next time I will have to add a little more seasoning (maybe crushed pepper flakes) to give it a little more flavor?!

I used cooked drained bacon in place of the prosciutto per my personal preference.  The only change I would make next time is to decrease the olive oil a bit.

Made this last weekend. It is expensive to make, but very good. I added this to my favorites list. I added Creamy Ranch dressing to the leftovers and it was excellent the next day as well.

really enjoyed this. used less basil leaves (probably about 1/3-1/2 what recipe calls for) and used chicken since I did not have any prosciutto on hand.

This is an unusual and delicious pasta salad. At first, I thought the amount of bow tie pasta was too much, but if you follow the recipe exactly (e.g., use the amount of olive oil called for), you will have a tasty dressing and salad. Also, adding the cheese is helpful. I will make again and have shared the recipe with others.

This is the best pasta salad I've ever had!  For years I made the typical tomato, broccoli, ital dressing pasta salad and this recipe blows that away!  I didn't have prosciutto, so I substituted imported ham, and it was still amazing.  Love this!

We made it more like a salad. We let the pasta and garlic-prosciutto cool and had fresh spinach and basil leaves. My kids ate it well with the addition of ranch or Italian dressing. I loved it plain. We will make this again.

It's a good base salad. I have another salad that I really enjoy that has sundried tomatoes, feta and use a italian mix for the dressing.

LOVE this! I did make some changes though so I can't give it 5 stars. I used bacon (never have prosciutto) and omitted the parm and pine nuts. The first time I made it the garlic was burned so I wouldn't saute it as long as it says.  Also, it needs a bit of acid so I added halved cherry tomatoes and it was amazing.  Definitely one of my favorites

We were looking for an "end of summer-basil plants need to be used" recipe and had had enough pesto (if that's possible).. This was the perfect "surprise!" Very good! and different.  As a family member doesn't eat pork... I substituted sun-dried tomatoes for the prosciutto and slowly ... very slowly heated oil/garlic in the tomato oil... FANTASTIC salad!.. and different enough to have everyone craving more!  Thanks!

Awesome salad, everyone loves this.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the prosciutto but added salt with the pasta cooking water as another reviewer suggested and it's perfect.  I will make for company next time.

I made this salad exactly as directed. It is a great combination of ingredients. But it was definitely lacking flavor as made, everyone loved it after adding some dressing for flavor. I will make again. The dressing we used is made by a local chef, but I imagine a little Italian dressing would taste good too.

Made this for mother's day.  Used hickory smoked bacon instead of prosciutto.  Was very good, got many compliments!

Great pasta salad!  I used sliced country baked ham and skipped the salt because it's what I had.  Can't wait to use the prosciutto next time!
