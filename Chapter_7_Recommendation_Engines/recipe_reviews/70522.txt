Soooo good!  I used a combo of shredded cheddar, bread crumbs, and corn flakes (actually threw in the crumbs from a Cheese-Nip box as well) to create the breading.  Also added extra cheese on top.  So delicious!  It's a constant request in the house.  Edit:  I've made this so many times and had so much fun playing around with it that I want to share - 1 cup of crackers (Ritz, cornflakes, saltines, cheese-nips, anything!), 1/2c parm chz, 1 1/2c cheddar, 1/2c bread crumbs.  I also dip the chicken in flour before the butter to help it stick.  This is a great recipe to be adventurous with - do not hesitate to play around!!!  Update 2:  I've discovered Panko bread crumbs to replace the standard crumbs.  WOW!  MUCH crispier and gives it that texture that I've noticed a lot of reviews say is missing.  No panko... try coursely crushing some croutons.

GREAT!!  only thing i did differently was to put a thin layer of the bread crumb mixture on the bottom of the baking dish before i put the chicken in. (just to keep the bottom of the chicken from getting soggy)  worked great!

This is delicious!  I made a few changes.  I used half butter, half olive oil.  Also used Italian herbed bread crumbs and a variety of Italian seasonings.  I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used chicken tenders (still flattened them though).  I greased the pan and followed others' suggestions by putting down a thin layer of bread crumbs in the pan before laying down the chicken.  The chicken tenders only took 18 minutes to bake, and then, following others' suggestions, I broiled the chicken for another 2 minutes.  I HIGHLY recommend broiling the chicken at the end because it gives it a delicious crunch!

An acceptable, but rather ordinary chicken recipe--kind of "ho hum." I'm sure I would have been a bigger fan of this when I was still cooking for my kids when they were younger, but as grown-ups we've moved kind of beyond your average Shake and Bake type chicken. I used crushed cornflakes rather than crumbs, and dill for the oregano, but nothing made this chicken "wake up."  On the upside, this is a "safe" chicken recipe, as even the pickiest of eaters wouldn't be able to find something not to like here--no unusual spices or blending of flavors. It was a little too buttery, however, so for those who would like to give this recipe a try I might suggest coating the chicken in egg rather than melted butter, and maybe drizzling a little butter over the top before baking.

Note:

Use an aluminum/foil pan for this recipe- it keeps the chicken from getting soggy. Also, throw the ingredients into a processor- it blends everything up all nice and makes it easier to coat the chicken.

This dish has a fabulous flavor. The chicken was swimming in butter so the next time I prepare I will place it on a roaster rack. I did not pound thin and I baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes and it came out perfect. I didn't use fresh garlic but rather from the jar and I used 4 teaspoons as we are garlic lovers and that was just right for us. I used garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs. I thought that I could have omitted the salt. I will definitely make this again but I hated that the bread crumbs became soggy in the butter. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great, tasty and easy chicken dish.  I used sharp cheddar cheese in this.  I omitted the extra salt and used unsalted butter; as the cheeses are salty enough.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and the proportions were just perfect.  I had to bake mine for extra time because my breasts were still partially frozen.  I didn't pound them either, and the chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Served with mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots.

Mmmm! I added a little flour to my breadcrumb mixture to make a nice crispy coating. Also, I didn't add the grated cheese to the dry mixture. I coated my chicken with butter, and then the crumb mixture as directed, and I sprinkled each piece of chicken with cheese so that it was sure to really melt into everything. Good stuff!

Absolutely Excellent!!!  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a few hours before preparing the dish.  I also used Garlic/Herb breadcrumbs.  I did need to bake it longer than 30 minutes though.   I baked it for an hour because I was baking potatoes at the same time.

I halved this recipe and made it last night for my boyfriend and I. It turned out wonderful!!! The chicken was so moist inside and very flavorful.  I used italian bread crumbs since thats what I had on hand, and parmesan/romano cheese mix (Kraft).  SOOOO yummy. I sprinkled a little extra cheddar on right at the very end. My boyfriend who isnt a big chicken eater normally, took the leftovers home with him!  Will make again for sure!

Delicious! The whole family loved it. I used Italian bread crumbs and also sprinkled a little garlic salt on the chicken before putting in the oven. After cooking for 20 minutes I turned the chicken over for the last 10 or 12 minutes to crisp up on both sides. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. I cut the chicken into 'fingers' and served them as an appetizer with a thick marinara to dip them into. I also baked them on a rack so that they crisped up on the bottom as well as the top.

This recipe is even better when you coat the breasts with flour first, then the garlic butter, then the breadcrumb mixture less the cheddar cheese.  Brown for about 2 minutes per side in a cast iron skillet, transfer to serving plates, top with cheese and put it in the microwave for 2 1/2 minutes.  Mine end up perfectly moist and cooked and not dry which will happen if oven-baked.  My process works for any kind of coating you want to put on CBs and they're done in about five minutes.

A great dish! Turns out perfectly every time. Very tasty, moist, and easy. I've made it probably 20 times, and never feel like I need to deviate from the recipe. Another perk - really basic ingredients that I almost always have on hand!

This recipe was good, easy too but nothing that blew me away. It seemed a bit tasteless even tho it seemed to have plenty of ingredients. i will make it again just maybe next time ill use a flavored bread crumb. I did use less butter as well since it was already swimming in the amount i put in.

Great.  Cut down on the butter and to keep it from getting soggy cook it on a cooling rack place in a cookie sheet so there is room for the liquid to collect under the rack.

I guess we may be a little spoiled by our other chicken recipes because this was only ok for us.  Not bad.  Everyone ate it but no one raved about it.  Probally wont make again.

An absolutely delicious chicken recipe!  This is a definite keeper.  I forgot to pound the chicken thin but it didn't affect the outcome at all.  This recipe can easily be scaled down for a smaller household.

I took other reviewers advice & sprinkled panko on the bottom of the pan, and also broiled for a few minutes at the end.  I did not do the garlic butter because my husband isn't big on garlic - I just melted butter & did add a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture.  Lots of flavor & nice crisp - but still moist.

Awesome!  I took one of the other reviewers advice and broiled the chicken for the last 2 minutes to give it a crispier topping but besides that I followed this exactly.  An easy 5 stars.  Thanks!

From other reviewers, I used Panko bread crumbs and dredged the chicken through flour before the butter.  I loved this chicken!!  I know it will be a staple in my house for years to come! Thanks for sharing.

Quick, easy, and very juicy. We were impressed. The only change we made was that we did not add the cheddar to the bread crumb mix, we put it on top.

This chicken is so good!  It is very hard to find something that all three of my children will eat.  They really enjoyed it. It was easy to fix with items that I have at home.  I did find that the very fine shredded cheese sticks to the chiken better than the larger shreds.  I'll definitely make this again!

Followed the suggestion to use half butter, half olive oil, and to put bread crumbs down on the bottom of the pan. Turned out great. Will definitely make again.

Used twice as much butter and garlic because I ran out while breading. Had plenty left over of the breading mix, even after double dipping. Came out great. Delicious!

Pretty good but VERY oily! Definitely will half the butter next time, and half olive oil as others suggested. I doubled the seasoning as suggested and I'm glad I did. I saved some of the cheddar cheese to sprinkle on top.

This is in regular rotation at our house.  My kids love it.  My breasts were a little thick, so I pounded them thin which reduced the cooking time.  I also pour any leftover topping over the chicken before baking.  Used panko bread crumbs for extra crunch.

I'm really bummed--I was all set to love this recipe (I love garlic and cheese, so I thought: how can I go wrong?) Well, something did.  This time, I did not tinker with the recipe like I normally do, and it just didn't turn out well.  It was soggy (and I even put it under the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking) and greasy.  Maybe something went wrong when I had the computer scale down the recipe from 8 to 4 servings...I dunno, but I won't be making this one again.

This was a great recipe!  I love baked chicken because it's so easy and this one combined my favorites, garlic and cheese!  I loved that I had everything I needed on hand, so it wasn't complicated.  One thing was that I wasn't sure how thin to pound the chicken, so I didn't go too crazy, I just kind of evened out the thicker spot.  The thing that I think just made it was using homeade breadcrumbs.  I just freeze the heals of our whole wheat bread and then grind them up in the blender and store the crumbs in the freezer so they're ready to go.  These bread crumbs gave the chicken such great texture, we loved it!  We will definitly make this again.

Mmmm! One of our go-to recipes!  I happen to LOVE this one!  It's easy and yum-yum-yummy!!!

** Worth noting - I've starting cooking ours on a cookie cooling rack that I lay across the foil-lined baking sheet.  This keeps the chicken up out of the grease and allows both sides to get/stay crispy.

Very yummy!! I used panko bread crumbs and just drizzled a little olive oil on the chicken instead of the rest of the butter. Then used the remainder of the garlic butter to toss on some red potatoes as a side. Very nice.

I made this chicken last night and it was a BIG hit!  My husband called it the best chicken dish ever! The only modifications I made were to halve the recipe, and I used fresh tarragon, fresh chives, salt, pepper and dried basil for the spices. For optimum flavor, use robust cheeses -- I used Baldersons 3 yr old Cheddar, and a good quality Parmesan (Reggianno).  Awesome results and will make this again often. Served it with Singapore noodles and green beans. Enjoy!

Thanks for such an easy recipe. The only change that I made was to use gluten-free bread crumbs. It turned out great!

I've made this several times for my family, they love it. I did change the recipe a little. I use a combo of Panko bread crumbs and dry Italian bread crumbs and also add granulated garlic and some fresh grated Parmigiano-reggiano to the crumb mixture. Once the chicken has been dipped in the garlic butter and crumbs, I let it rest in the fridge for at least an hour before baking and add a bit more shredded Cheddar to the top of each breast. The crust is awesomely crispier if you let it rest first.

This was an "okay" idea, but it needs alot of help.  Add more spices because its bland.  Only coat the top of the chicken with the breaded mixture because the bottom does not get crispy and is very soggy!  I took the advice of the others on here who have said the bottom turns out too soggy.  The tip was to put bread crumbs in the bottom of your pan before you lay your chicken on top.  It didnt help much and just burned to the bottom of the pan when you put it on broil for the last few minutes.  Next time I will leave the back side uncoated to avoid the mushy mess.  Its a MUST to put this on broil otherwise it will not be brown or crisp..just a pale mush with cheese on top.!  The picture shown for this recipe can NOT be from following these instructions.  In the picture the chicken looks brown and the coating looks appitizing.  If that chicken is brown then that cheese on top would not look like it was just sprinkled on with a few minutes of melt time.  I followed these instructions and my chicken did not look like that.   Beware when you cook this and use your own judgement b/c these instructions will not get you the results you see in the picture.

I made this using chicken tenders.  I didn't have parsley and used a little basil & oregano as well as seasoned garlic salt & pepper.  I have read some low reviews indicating there wasn't enough flavor.  That's simply because there wasn't enough seasoning added.  I didn't follow the recipe there but added the amount of seasoning I typically use when fixing chicken.  The taste was wonderful - my daughter announced that it was her new favorite dish.  The best part of the chicken dish were the little bits of cheese and bread crumbs at the bottom of the pan - in the wonderful garlic-flavored butter.  Definitely a keeper make-again recipe!

This was quite good! Not quite super amazing, but a very nice meal that the whole family will enjoy. I didn't really do anything different, except I had on hand a bag of shredded cheddar/mozz blend so I used that. I was also a bit short on time and simply melted already-made garlic butter in the microwave, it worked fine. I have yet to find a way to cook breaded chicken in the oven so that the bottom doesn't get soggy.. this time I tried lining my dish with foil and it didn't seem to help.  I also meant to add more cheese on top toward the end of cooking time but I forgot - will do so in the future.

Looked great when it came out of the oven and TASTED even better! :) I did not have the utensils to pound the breasts thin & reduced to 2 servings. Other than using a shredded mozzerella & provelone blend in place of parmesan I follwed the proportionate recipe exactly. Also followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting a layer of breadcrumbs on the bottom of pan (I used a 8x8 glass pan). Cooked 45 minutes to compensate for thicker meat. Served with Pillsbury Crecent Rolls (just stuck them in the same oven for the last 13 minutes!), steamed broccoli & Grand Traverse Late Harvest Chardonnay (yea for MI wines!). I will DEFINATELY make this again!!!

This was awesome!  I used Panko bread crumbs and added more seasonings and broiled it at the end for about 2 minutes.  It came out nice and crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside!!   I will definitely make again!!

I made these tonight following the recipe exactly.  My husband and kids loved them but it was difficult to get the breading to stick to the chicken.  I like to try the original recipe first before I change anything but next time, I will coat chicken in flour and use eggs to stick the breading on the chicken and bake them in the oven.

Ok this recipe is awesome. If you like garlic, this is it! I thought this was the strangest combination, cheddar and garlic, but I was SO SO SO happy with the results. I've been searching for the perfect chicken recipe that you can use with anything and this is it for me! I really didn't change anything but used italian bread crumbs, no parsley or oregano (used italian seasoning instead) and we always cook with Promise Light (butter substitute) so I used that, and it lowered the calories a bit. It was beyond perfect for me. I wanted to make it every day this weekend. LOVED it! It was so garlicy and moist. I didn't find it mushy, just moist. I could go on and on about this. I would give this 10 starts but that's just me!!! LOVE IT!

Total flop in my house. Followed recipe exactly. Chicken was moist but totally without flavor. Bread crumb topping rated an "ok" from husband, son & I did not care for it at all. Giving this recipe a BIG thumbs down.

Absolutely wonderful, will make again and again.  Only change was way less butter to make it a bit healthier.  Next time I'll try plain breadcrumbs instead of the Italian kind.

I only did half the recipe cause I was just making three breasts and it turned out great. I also used minced garlic out of a jar. ½ tsp= 1 clove. And I thought it worked really well. I also only had Italian bread crumbs. Other then that I followed exactly the same. I can’t wait to make this when we have family over I know it will be a hit.

Delicious! A favorite in our house. I've liked playing around with this recipe a little, but my favorite way so far is whole wheat Ritz Crackers and bread crumbs (and if I have them on hand club crackers...they have a little bit of a buttery taste) cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, little bit of italian seasoning, and a little bit extra garlic. I have two very picky eaters in my house and this is a favorite of theirs, so that's saying a lot!

Turned out very tender and moist.  The cheeses added great flavor.  I paired this with yellow rice and veggies covered in cheddar.

We love this dish!  I've cooked it three times now.  I typically scale the dish to 4 servings for 3 large breasts and it works out great.  Echo everyone else:  1)  coat the baking dish with breadcrumbs to avoid sticking and to sop up any unwanted runoff  2)  BROIL for the last 2-3 minutes for a great crunchy texture.  I make this as-stated but I use about 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning in place of the parsley and organo.  I also use seasoned breadcrumbs.   I served it with sautéed asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes and it's a win.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

So good all my kids even liked it.  Be sure to dip the chicken in flour before the butter mixture to help the butter stick to it.

This was pretty good but far from great.  I was hoping for a little more and would not knowingly order this in a restaurant.

I SUBSTITUTE CORN FLAKE CRUMBS FOR BREAD CRUMBS.  THE RESULT WAS A CRUCHY AND BETTER TASTING CHICKEN CRUST.  ALSO SUBSTITUTE DRIED CHIVES FOR PARSLEY.

This is a great recipe!  The chicken turns out so tender and the breading taste so good.  I used flavored bread crumbs so I didn't add the parsley or oregano but I did add freshly ground pepper.  I also didn't add the salt.  It had so much flavor.  My son ate seconds and wanted thirds and my picky toddler who doesn't eat anything ate all of her chicken.  Will definetely make this again.  My son wants me to make it again tomorrow!

This was delicious and my picky teenage daughter even liked it. I used the Panko crumbs, which gave it a nice crispy texture. I sprinkled extra crumbs and cheese over the top of the chicken. Per the advice of other reviewers, I sprinkled the bottom of the pan with crumbs to prevent sogginess, and I broiled it the last 2 minutes. Served with broccoli, salad, and baked potatoes. Yum!

Wow-I thought this was so incredible for such a simple dish! I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was so moist, tender, and most importantly, garlicky! I used smart balance and it turned out great.

I really liked this dish! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and I will definitely make it again! I did as other reviewers recommended and put bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan to keep the chicken from getting soggy. I also coated the chicken in flour prior to dipping in the garlic butter mixture. So, so good!

Mmmmm!  My family really like this!  It did end up being a tad salty so next time I'll omit the extra salt.  (I use salted butter and the cheeses are salty.)  I did double the parsley and oregano but next time may swap the oregano for basil.  I used chicken tenders istead of breast and kept the baking time the same since a lot of  flavor comes from the butter getting brown.  Oh, and I used Panko bread crumbs.

I must be the only one who didn't care for this dish.  It was quite flavorless.  Maybe I will try it again someday, it's possible I wasn't in the mood to eat it at the time.  My kids seemed to like it though.

This is truly awesome!  In fact, we're making it again tonight!  I used parmesan bread crumbs and omitted the salt (the cheese makes it salty enough for us).  The bottoms were a little "soggy" but the sides and tops were so crisp that the bottom didn't bother us at all.  Served this with mashed potatoes and was very filling.  Next time I will try others' suggestion of freezing the cheese then crumbling it in.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 but only used three breasts, and those three took up my entire baking dish!

WOW! Yes, fattening, but a treat to repeat!  As for those trying to cut the butter with EVOO, not only will it need to be cooked at a higher temp to get the crispness, but it will also slightly change the taste of the cheese.  Suck it up & just use butter...just don't make it every day!  I made 2 simple changes...to make a more intense cheese flavor, I added some ground mustard and I did omit the salt, but added a dash of garlic salt.  As for the prep...I noticed some said they had a problem getting the cheese to stick to the chicken in the bread mixture.  I threw my bag of cheese in the freezer for about 20 min, then chopped it up a bit when it was super cold.  When mixed with the crumbs, it stuck just fine.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I decided to give this recipe a 5 after I watched my husband finish his supper and get up from the table....he brought the aluminum foil that I had baked the chicken on back to the table and proceeded to eat every crumb that he could find.  It was that good!

Unbelievable recipe! 
This has become our favorite dish! I make it so often, I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore! 
Let me tell you, I am not a big chicken fan but this recipe has got me eating frequently now. You can't screw this recipe up, it is very forgiving. I can't tell you the last time I used any form of measurement to make it and it has always come out perfect.

Have tried this recipe twice now exactly as instructed except I cut the breasts in half before pounding thin.  Also used a mixture of both sharp and mild cheddar. It turned out fantastic both times.  As another person recommended, this time I cooked on a foil lined baking sheet coated with Pam and thought it had more of a golden brown color and the texture was not soggy.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is delicious. Love the flavors of the cheddar and garlic butter. The only two minor complaints I have was I couldn't fit all 8 breasts in a 9 x 13 after "pounding thin";so I used (2) 9 x 13's. Also,they weren't crisp;so I took advise of others, and broiled for a few minutes. Great recipe, though! The whole family liked. And, it is something I would serve to company;as presentation was nice with the shredded cheddar bits throughout the bread crumbs. Went great with brown and wild rice, green beans and a green salad. Thank you, Baylor66. Will make again and again.

Not sure whether I should be reviewing this because instead of chicken I used... TOFU!  I was looking for something a little different, and this was just delicious.  My success with this makes me think that this would be a great recipe not just for chicken but other white meats and vegetables (eggplant would be beautiful!).  Easy, and very quick.  Other than changing the main ingredient in the dish, I felt the need to omit the dried parsley, which might as well be hay for the flavour it has to me, and instead add chopped fresh parsley to the butter after cooking the garlic in it.  I had no problems with sogginess, but then again, I DID cook it longer than 30 min.  I baked it until golden, and it was both crunchy and juicy.  (When I make this with chicken, I'll be increasing the temperature rather than the cooking time so it doesn't dry out though.)

WOW!! What a wonderful recipe..very flavorful. The only thing I did differently was when the chicken was done cooking, I put it under the broiler for a couple of mins. to kind of crisp up the coating. This is a wonderful recipe.

The only change I made was using mozzarella instead of the cheddar.....and it was delicious. Oh, I also used 4 cloves of garlic in my adjusted recipe for 2 servings. This is definitely a keeper. Easy, quick, and tasty. My husband usually scrapes any toppings off foods but when he heard it was garlic and butter he tasted it and said it was good.

This was *much* better than the last garlic chicken recipe I tried. To be honest, I couldn't really taste the cheddar, but the Parm and garlic were very good, so that was fine with me. Followed the recipe exactly.

This is a delicious recipe - I had a family favourite years ago from a Canadian Living magazine that was similar (except you wrapped the flattened chicken around a cheddar cheese rectangle, this one is much simpler). I used panko crumbs for the bread crumbs, Italian seasoning for the oregano, and grated extra cheddar cheese, which I put over the chicken with about 10 minutes remaining. I also baked the chicken at 400 F (for the same time, but the chicken breasts were large), which crisped up the coating. Yummy!

4 stars because I made changes to the amts of the ingredients. 10 stars with my modifications. I used sharp cheddar cheese and up all the spices to 1 tsp. I also use 1/2 bread crumds & 1/4 cup Panko. Scooped out the garlic after sauteeing and spread them on top of the meats before bakng. This came out really good. Best chicken I ever made. No leftovers YEAH!!!Thank you BAYLOR66.

A very easy, but wonderful recipe!  I halved the recipe and baked the chicken in a 10 inch cast iron skillet.  The 10 inch cast iron skillet is small enough to fit inside my toaster oven.  I served the chicken with some salute pasta.  Definitely a keeper.

Didn't have chicken breasts, so I used chicken thighs (boneless, skinless). Also had to use garlic powder instead of fresh (also out of it). I omitted the salt and added onion powder. Also, due to a lack of Parm, I added some grated Asiago cheese. Turned out wonderfully tender and crispy. very flavorful. Hubby loves it, too.

Best chicken I've eaten in a long time! My friend said, "This is better than my mom's!" Uh-oh! :) Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. I've made this 2x in 4 wks because it's awesome. I use margarine instead of butter to cut some fat.

Made this as part of mis7up's Hidden Treasures challenge. This has been in my recipe box since 10, Jan. 2011.  There is a reason this recipe has 1,300+ reviews - it is that good.  The breading of bread crumbs, Parmesan & Cheddar cheeses, parsley, oregano, salt and pepper is a wonderful combination.  I made this as written and used my own bread crumbs.   This is a great "company" recipe with a taste that will not fail.  BAYLOR66 most definately has a winner with this one!

I've made this a few times now and am finally getting around to reviewing it. Here's my two cents: go easy on the butter. It doesn't sacrifice the recipe at all to use far less than called for. Instead of fresh garlic cloves, I use the minced garlic in a jar. I use 1/2 breadcrumbs and 1/2 panko for a crispier texture and sub out basil for the oregano (not a fan). I prefer buying boneless, skinless thin-sliced breasts to avoid pounding them down. It also results in a quicker baking time (I do 20 min at 400 degrees, or 25 min at 375). Finally, don't bother dirtying a baking dish. Just line a baking sheet with parchment paper for quick and easy cleanup. This chicken pairs well with various side dishes, so it makes a weekday dinner a snap to prepare. This is always a hit with the family, so thank you for the submission!

I halved the recipe, but still had enough of the breadcrumb mixture to do 6 breasts, not 4. I didn't pound them thin and they were done in 40 minutes. The overall flavor was a little bland, though my husband liked it. If I make it again I would follow another reviewer's suggestion and add the cheddar shortly before the end.

This was very good! I made it using cheddar, parmesan and mozzarella too, because I had only half the parmesan the recipe called for. The flavor is awesome, and I am definitely going to be making this again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I scaled it down to 2 chicken breasts, and used 1/2 the seasonings.  I took the advice of another and added Old Bay as well.  Next time, I may add some Panko instead of bread crumbs, just for crunchiness.  Will definitely keep this in my dinner rotation!!

Wow this was fantastic! I used pre minced garlic in the jar and melted with butter in the microwave (lazy, I know) and also didn't have parmesan cheese so I used all cheddar. It was so incredibly delicious! I made mashed potatoes to go with it and I think it was one of the best recipes I've cooked! My dad loved it too. It was also very easy to make which is always a bonus. I definitely recommend if you want a no fuss, delicous meal. :)

If there are 20 stars this recipe would get all 20.  This is something like you'd get at Olive Garden. Definitely a "for-company" type dish and easy to boot!  I absolutely loved, loved, loved this recipe.

This is my second time making this.  First time was a disaster b/c It came out very soggy and I over did the garlic.  This time I made two adjustments.  1. I didn't pour the remaining butter and garlic on the chicken.  I separated the garlic from the butter and just drizzled the butter over the chicken.  2) I broiled the chicken for at least almost 10 minutes to make it crispy.  Before then the chicken was cooked but the breading was very soggy.  I did both times what others suggested and put the breading on the bottom of the pan, but it still was soggy until I broiled it.  I have been told by my 3 & 5 year old as well as DH that it can be "added to the recipe book" a huge deal in our world.  Once it is there the dish is always fair game and can appear at any time.  Everyone (kids and DH) have to give it a thumbs up before putting it in the book.  I will say that I ranked it only four stars though b/c in my world five stars has to go to something that is out of this world.  And while this is great...I wouldn't say it was out of this world.  But it is definitely something we will add to our chicken options!  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: This still is a HUGE hit in my household.  I probably make it twice a month.  My 4 year old actually asks for seconds!  I've found a trick...if you put a cookie cooling rack inside a cookie pan (jelly roll pan) and then put your chicken on top of the cooling rack, the chicken doesn't get mushy on either side!

Normally, I would never do a negative review when I changed a recipe.  I'm doing this one so that future users will know what NOT to do when making this recipe....  I used Italian bread crumbs but omitted the parsley and oregano.  I also used about a half a teaspoon of salt because other reviewers said it was bland.  Everything else I did as written, and it just was not good.  Way too salty.  Maybe I caked too much stuff on the chicken, I don't know.  Hope this helps avoid future disasters, but I won't be making it again either way.

Yum!  The only alteration is I used colby shredded instead of cheddar because that is what I had.  The secret to getting the breading to stick is to blot the chicken with paper towels before dipping into the garlic sauce.  Also, I had to cook mine a full 45 minutes so make sure to allow enough time!  My sides were ready before the main dish.  Similar to other breaded chicken recipes, but the garlic butter and cheese are a great twist!

Smells delicious while oven frying. :) I definitely recommend the panko for a better crunch.  Also, we found that 1 1/2 cups of cheddar was way too much.  I use about 3/4 of a cup of very sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup of parmesan.  I also dip the chicken in flour before the butter.  It definitely helps to keep the cheese and breading in tact. Since chicken breast is so bland, I mixed salt in with the flour for an extra layer of flavor.  My family really enjoyed this served with buttered noodles and a green leafy salad.

Great for the GARLIC LOVER!!!  My teenage son even loved it!  I used seasoned panko breadcrumbs that gave an extra crispiness.  Also, I found that the butter/garlic mixture was just enough to coat both sides of only 4 halves of chicken breast (lightly pounded).  Next time I'll probably add more to have enough to pour over the top.  Used Italian seasoning because I didn't have any oregano or parsley on hand and one of my favorite kitchen tricks is to use either a microplane or small grater for the garlic rather than trying to mince small. Always looking for something easy with ingredients that are usually on hand...this was great!

Made this recipe last night at my husband's urging. Usually he doesn't care for cheese and chicken, except parmigiana. He asked me to make this. I only had shredded mozzarella cheese and exchanged 1 tblspn of extra virgin olive oil, rather than butter. Never added salt because of health issues. I made it using 6 breasts which were already pretty flat. Used panko whole wheat crumbs. I served it with leftover rice pilaf to which I added about 1 cup of frozen peas, which I steamed for the 30 minutes that the chicken baked. I didn't believe that the chicken would be ready in just 30 minutes, but I found that it was true. Great dish, great leftovers and very easy.

My whole family loved this. It was fun and easy to prepare, smelled fabulous the whole time it was baking, and the poster was right--no leftovers! I used extra sharp cheddar and an extra two cloves of garlic. I actually forgot to pound the chicken thin, but just added extra cooking time and it still turned out perfect. Thanks so much for sharing this. Another keeper from allrecipes.com, my favorite website!

I just made this tonight for dinner.  It was VERY good.  We thought we would have leftovers but there was nothing left!  I didn't have oregano or parsley.  I used pepper, basil, garlic, and salt.  I also used corn flakes with bread and put it in my blender.  I also blended some cheese in with the bread crumb mixture and a couple handfuls of flour.  Then I shredded some cheese to sprinkle on top.  I sprinkled the bottom of the pan with the bread crumb mixture.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again! Our 7 year old devoured it like it was his last meal (and he is SUPER picky). Awesome recipe!

Great chicken recipe! I used Italian bread crumbs and since I didn't realize I didn't have dried oregano, I just decided to use some MORE Italian seasoning. :)  Turned out great! Boyfriend loved it and it will definitely be making a prime spot in my cook book.

This recipe is made once a week at our house. Its so easy to put together & always tastes great.  We used to stuff the chicken with Mozz. before breading, but now (trying to cook with a toddler in the kitchen) I just sprinkle it on top at the end. It is also easier to melt the butter in the microwave with either halved garlic cloves, or garlic powder. I don't even have to turn on the stove. Line the pan w/ foil & I don't have to clean up either.  Also goes great with the honey roasted potatoes on this site.

This is the 1st time my husband has ever said "I LOVE THIS!" about my cooking. I halved the recipe. Followed someone else's suggestion to sub. olive oil for half of the butter. I put half the cheddar cheese in the bread crumb mix, and the other half sprinkled on top. I also spinkled a little bit of garlic powder on top. I didn't have any parsley so subbed a little more oregano and thyme.

Great everyday recipe.  Ready in a flash and you probably have everything in your fridge and pantry. The garlic makes your kitchen smell like heaven--my family swoons when they walk in.  I've used Penzey's spices Fox Woods mix instead of the herbs and it's delicious that way too.

This was ok, but nothing special.  Just tasted like chicken.  I followed the recipe, except adding more garlic.  I also crushed up a few cheese crackers i had left and added to the bread crumb mixture.  I will not be making this again.

Very good.  I only used a 1/4 cup of butter and it was plenty.  Liked how the topping came out nice and crunchy.

Tasty stuff! Chose for low carb. I melted the butter & garlic in a small skillet over low heat. It was easy to dip the chicken in this way. I also like to use a flat-type bowl or container to put the crumbs in. I always bake my chicken at least 40 minutes, but the time is probably right on if the breasts are rather thin. Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist chicken - everyone liked it and I will make this recipe again.  I did not bake the chicken for 30 minutes as I think this would make it a little dry.  I baked it for 20-25 minutes and it turned out very moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe.  The next time I will brown bacon and cut it into bits and add it to the topping.  My husband agreed a touch of bacon would take this chicken to a new level.

Maybe I did something wrong, but mine turned out dry and I couldn't taste the cheese or garlic much.  Smelled great, but we were disappointed with the taste.  I halved the recipe and had way too much topping in the end.  Thanks for sharing.
UPDATE: I tried this again and it was a hit.  This time I covered with aluminum foil so it stayed moist.  I'd suggest cutting back on the salt and substitute garlic powder though.

This had a really good flavor. They did not get crispy on their own. I had to transfer them to a cookie sheet, turn the oven up to 400* and bake them on the bottom rack for 5 mins to get them to crispen up on the bottom. I also put more cheese on at the end because the cheese gets very crispy when baked and I wanted a more gooey cheese flavor. Served with fresh boiled broccoli and cheese sauce. Overall a good recipe.

These are a hit.  My husband is quite picky and he loved this entree.  Even my 2 year loved this.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and they were moist and tender when done.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I hate to go against all of the other great reviews, but this was just an ok breaded chicken recipe.  For one, the cheese didn't add anything to the flavor of the chicken.  No one who ate it could tell that there was even cheese in the breadcrumbs.  To me, that's just a waste of an ingredient.  And for that reason alone I give this only 3 stars.  The breading did get soggy, even cooking on my pizza stone.  And that's where all of the cheese wound up, burned on the bottom of the stone.  Thanks anyway.

FANTASTIC!! The only mistake I made was only making two breast~I did get a small chuck to taste but my hasband ate both of them!! So will definately make at LEAST 3 next time!! They really really awesome~super juicy so sooo easy, the only thing I did to make my life easier was combine all the "crust" ingredients in a large ziplock and shook, it was really easy to smash everything onto the chicken w/o me having to touch (complusive hand washer here~can't touch the chicken) will definately be making this winner again and again!! tx so much:O)

This was awesome. One of the easiest recipes I've done in awhile. I was lazy and did not pound the chicken, just adjusted the cooking time. It is very tender and moist. Well worth adding to the recipe box!

All my guests raved over these.  I will make these again and again.  Very easy.  I cut mine into strips to serve more people.  Also, placed crumb mixture in a ziplock and shook the chicken to coat it.  Worked great.

This was very good.  The chicken eded up moist and it was delicious.  The only complaint from hubby is that it came out a bit soggy...I agree.  I will definately be making again.  Thanks for the post.

Love the flavor on this one!  Had to cook slightly longer than 30 minutes but that was my fault as I forgot to pound the chicken thin.  I covered it the during the last 10 or 15 mins of baking, as it was looking a little dry, but it came out very moist and juicy!  Also used less cheddar than called for and omitted the salt.  Common ingredients, easy prep...I will make this again.

My kids and husband have already asked for this meal again. I cooked the chicken a little longer because I didnt pound it. The flavor was excellent! I put the dry ingredients in a processor so the cheddar cheese would break up nice and small. I will definitely make this a regular dinner at my house.

Delicious with lots of flavor!! Loved it! I used Italian bread crumbs (eliminated parsley and oregano) and put it under the broiler for a minute after baking (bottom comes out soggy). Definitely making this again!!

Definitely goes into our Family Fav file.  We didn't have enough cheddar so we used some cheddar, some swiss and some monterrey jack and it was WONDERFUL!  Highly recommend and will be making it again SOON!

Tried this recipe tonight and my family asked me to make sure I add this to our "do again" list! Trust me, that doesn't happen often! I took others' advice and added some bread crumbs to the bottom of the dish.  Next time, I'm going to try using half butter, half olive oil.

We try to keep things healthy and don't do butter, so I dipped the chicken in an egg mixture instead of butter and added a little garlic powder to the bread crumbs to keep the garlic flavor. I followed others' suggestions of putting crumb mixture on the bottom of the pan before putting in the chicken, and it turned out really crispy all around. I ended up cooking it longer than 30 minutes though. Great recipe, will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great! I took the advise of others and added more bread crumbs under the chicken in my pan and I lined the pan with non-stick tin foil. I might try panco next time. Great recipe to build on.

Very good chicken! I just eye balled the breading ingredients and used fresh parsley. I through everything in the food processer and it adhered to the chicken perfectly. I turned the broiler on after 30 minutes of cooking to brown them up a bit. Chicken came out moist, juicy and very tasty.

Delicious!  I used panko bread crumbs, more seasoning as others had suggested and sprinkled the cheddar cheese over the top of the chicken as it baked instead of adding it to the bread crumb mixture.  I spooned extra garlic butter over the top before serving.  It's even good left over!

I've made the recipe exactly as stated many times.  I've found that using 1/4 cup of panko helps with the chicken staying crispy.  My three children love this so that makes it a winner in our house!

One of my family's favorite ways to make super fast chicken. I made the follow adaptations: Blend Panko and Italian Herbed & Garlic Bread crumbs, Instead of pounding thin, slice chicken breasts in half to thin them out. Cut the Butter in half. Turn the chicken half way through and top with shredded cheddar for last minute instead of mixing it with breadcrumbs. Great melted cheesy topping, with less (only 1/2 cup)

Great! It is my favorite chicken recipe! I think I make it every time we have anyone over. It always gets raves. I do increase the garlic cloves to 6 and use extra sharp cheddar cheese. I am not a big chicken fan unless it is full of flavor and this one is a winner. Add some homemade garlic bread and some pasta with garlic olive oil and basil and you have a fantastic dinner.

I used margarine instead of butter and a little less than the recipe calls for.  I also cut back on the amount of parmesan.  The cheddar doesn't stick to the chicken very well but the overall flavours are outstanding!  I like that this is all done in the oven and produces a flavourful, moist chicken breast!

Very Good!! I omitted the extra salt because Parmesan is already salty.  This is definitely a keeper!!  I used chicken tenders and baked them on parchment paper @ 350* for about 20 minutes.

All of this thought that this was pretty tasty.  The only one who didn't really care for itwas my two year old daughter and it's not very easy to please her anyway.  I didnt' have bread crumbs, so I used flour instead.  I doubt that it made much difference.  Thanks for the yummy recipe :).

This was really easy to put together and somewhat reminiscent of a chicken kiev. I stuck closely to the recipe except that I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a couple of hours... which complemented the coating really well. I would definitely do this recipe again.

FAB-U-LOUS!!!  Great recipe that the whole family loved - no leftovers!!  I used chicken breast tenderloins - which were perfect.  Like other reviewers, I coated the chicken in flour first, then in the garlic butter and cheese/crumb mixture.  I also put bread crumbs on the bottom of my baking dish to prevent the chicken from being soggy on the bottom.   I used slightly more seasoning than the recipe called for, and the results were fantastic.  Thanks BAYLOR66!!  This is a keeper!!

There was no way I was going to dip the chicken in butter! 
Instead, I added garlic powder to the cheese/bread crumb mix and dipped the chicken in egg first. It worked great! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful! This will be a favorite in our house for sure!

For me this came out really bland. The chicken was really moist and tender, but definately not enough spice.
If I do this again, I'm upping the spice definately. Quarter / Eighth teaspoons isn't anywhere near enough.

This was delicious and my boyfriend, who is very health conscious and typically sticks with one serving at a meal, was quite sad to find out I had only made two chicken breasts.  This is definitely a keeper and would be great for a dinner party.  I used panko and I sprinkled cheddar on top instead of putting it in the crumbs.  I baked it with the roasted broccoli recipe from this website and there were zero leftovers of anything.  Awesome recipe!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  My girls (ages 4 and 6) absolutely loved it and had thirds and also loved helping make dinner, it was so simple.  Only modification was to use Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular.

I have made this recipe multiple times with multiple little variations, and it is always delicious.  It's my family's most requested dinner.  Always pound out the chicken.  Don't try to substitute panko for bread crumbs.  Pre-seasoned italian bread crumbs are a passable substitute if you don't have the spices. Thank you so much for this recipe, I'll be eating it for years to come!

This was rather strong and overpowering, but I feel that if I was to tweak it a bit, it would be rather nice. The panko crumbs were nice.

Everyone loved it.  I used panko and had to double the breading to cover 6 breasts.  I baked it on a rack on top of a cookie sheet.  Really good flavor and the chicken came out tender & juicy.

I love this recipe.  I have made this many times and it is always a huge hit.  I do put done a sprinkle of bread crumbs in the bottom of the pan so the chicken doesn't stick.  I will try this and make a marinara sauce so I can serve parmsean chicken.

The only thing that I did differently was I used panko bread crumbs. It was so crunchy and really, really good. I will be making this again and again!

delicious and juicy, next time I'll pound the chicken even thinner or butterfly the breasts.  I double the amount of dry seasoning in the breading.

This was a great quick and easy weeknight meal. I also used an olive oil mixture (1/2 oil, 1/2 butter) to cook the garlic and used turkey chops instead of chicken breasts. This was an instant hit--my husband went back for seconds and my finicky toddler didn't offer any of his dinner to the dog (a rarity these days). Good, basic recipe that I'll definitely make again.

I LOVED THIS!!!!

I have been living in the south of china for almost a year now, and only have access to some of the western ingredients I am used to cooking with. I find it difficult to make meals that my  family will enjoy.....until this!!
This recipe was such a hit with my picky daughter and husband who doesn't like any thing I cook, that they BOTH cleaned their plates!! I didn't change a thing in the recipe and don't think anything needs changing, it is perfect just the way it is.
Thank you so much for this delicious  chicken dish, and the peace of mind from knowing that once a week my family will enjoy at least one meal!!!

Not only was this chicken recipe delicious, it looked beautiful on the plates when I served it. Almost didn't want to cut into it and ruin it, but glad I did :) It was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside with lots of flavor. I used sharp cheddar and also spiced it up with cheyenne because we like our food with a little kick at my house.

Delicious!!   Sooo tender and juicy!  You won't be dissapointed.  If you're lazy like me, add garlic powder to the melted butter instead of using real garlic.  It's a good idea to pound the chicken first..it'll be so tender you won't need a knife

This is my teenage son's favorite non-spaghetti dish. The only change I made was to replace the butter with olive, something I did initially because I was out of butter, but repeated because we liked the it.

Awesome and a family favorite! I slice the breasts lengthwise to save time and use Italian style bread crumbs and garlic salt and omit most of the other seasonings. It makes dinner real quick to prepare!

Fantastic - super easy to put together and a very tasty result!! I never keep dried parsley so I substituted some italian seasoning. As well, I didn't feel like getting a saucepan out (did these in a toaster oven) just to melt butter so I grated some garlic and put it on a plate with the butter and into the microwave for about 30 seconds. One of the best tips from another poster was to use a food processor to blend the breadcrumbs and cheese together and it worked fabulously. I had a very nice even breadcrumb/cheese coating that stuck well to the chicken.
I also 1/4'd the recipe as there's only 2 of us and I had 2 chicken breasts. This one is going into my recipe book!

This was good, the chicken comes out tender and juicy. This is a mild flavored dish so some people may think it is bland. Good grief, grab a bottle of hot sauce if you feel the need. For me, there are times that I want something mild.  I will be making this again.

I think this could be kicked up a little but my husband who does not like a lot of flavors liked it a lot.  It was one of his most favorite things I have made from this site.  Update to my review - In order to save time I melted butter in a 9x13 glass dish in the oven, put about 5 cloves of garlic, added the chicken, poured the crumbs mixture over the top.  This saved a lot of time and it was really good.  I also added more seasonings to the crumb mixture and with those extra seasonings and the extra garlic in the pan it was very good and smelled great cooking.  No mess either.

Delicious recipe!  Made the recipe to create 3 servings, and it ended up making the perfect amount for three people.  The chicken ended up delightfully crispy.  The only thing I changed was the amount of pepper - I nearly doubled the amount of pepper, which gave the chicken some zing.  I will use this again - quick, easy, delicious!

Scaled this to two servings (going a bit over 2 on each ingredient), and it was fantastic!  I replaced the bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs as another reviewer suggested.  If you like the texture of fried chicken, and don't want the undue fat and calories, give this a shot. Served with mac and cheese (a recipe from this site) and a salad for Valentine's Day!

Super yummy! I couldn't stop eating it. Another keeper for sure. I followed a couple of the suggestions. One to add foil to the bottom of the cooking pan & the other to add some bread crumbs to the bottom of the pan. I also added a couple chicken thighs & those tasted very good as well.

More tasty than the Parmesam Chicken everyone is used to. Don't cook over 30 minutes or the cheese will get hard and dry. I just made 1/2 of this recipe using 3 chicken breast, pounded very thin, my husband and I had 1 piece each and 1 piece was left for lunch tomorrow. Will make again, also I made it EXACTLY like recipe is written, otherwise how can you honestly rate it?? Next time I may change things a bit but not telling here!! Great as is!!

WOW!  Everyone loved this chicken.  I used Panko bread crumbs and seasoned the chicken with Slap ya mama cajun seasoning and garlic powder. I also added some seasoning to the cheese mixture. This was SO YUMMY..will be made many times!

This chicken was super juicy, and the leftovers were delicious the next day, too. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and dotted the chicken with some extra butter in the baking dish, but it needed very little.

it's sooo good. the chicken is so tender and juicy. i used herb bread crumbs by VIGO which gave it the perfect amount of spice. Also, i started at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, then bumped it up to 400 for the last ten minutes and it browned the breading perfectly! my husband, roomate, and i ate in rapturous silence till our plates were clean.

This was enjoyed by all in my house (hubby, 8YO & 4YO) which says a lot.  I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 c of OVO.  Also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Really tasty.

My husband and I ate this all in one sitting.  Cut garlic down to two cloves, and split butter mixture between margarine and EVOO.  Used regular Italian breadcrumbs with black pepper, parsley and oregano for seasoning.

Liked the cheddar coating, but the coating was soggy on the underside from so much butter.  It was swimming in butter.

It was very good with only a short amount of prep time.  I also had all the ingredients in my pantry so it worked out very well.  I did cook mine more than the 30 minutes suggested but it could be that my chicken breasts were larger than those used in the original recipe.  I would recommend this as a quick dinner for everyone!

Made this after church and boy was it a hit! I knew that I would need to spice it up a bit for my family, so I just upped the black pepper, added some red pepper and used seasoning salt.  For bread crumbs, I always use Panko.  This will be a staple in our home. Added note...I've made this AGAIN and AGAIN.  Everyone loves it.  And I would disagree with anyone who says it's like Shake and Bake.  It's so much better with the cheese and Panko.  Another EASY, EASY, EASY recipe!  THANKS Baylor66 for sharing it with us!

This was amazing! I personally love reading the reviews and am so glad they are available to us! I'm sure this recipe is wonderful as written, but knowing that I can make it a little crisper by lining the pan with crumbs makes this recipe perfect. Thank you BAYLOR66 for such a great recipe!!

Wow. My husband asked me to put this in my regular rotation. While the chicken breasts were still mostly frozen, I sliced them horizontally to make several very thin breasts. The thinnest parts were the yummiest, so I will definitely do that again. Served with winter squash and Pioneer Woman's crash hot potatoes.

My husband told me that this was the BEST chicken he's had in years. We used panko bread crumbs, because that is what we had on hand. Crunchy, delicious, easy. Will definitely make again!!

Fantastic! I used thick cut pork chops, pre-chopped garlic, panko, threw in some crushed Goldfish crackers (plus parm/cheddar cheese) and baked - may add a touch of salt next time - absolutely going to be a staple in our house!

awesome recipe.  The only changes I made was I dipped the chicken in egg, then breadcrumb mixture.  used the butter and garlic, but browned the chicken in the butter and garlic, before transferring to a casserole dish!!  Will definately make again.  Thanks

Cut the chicken breasts in half (long wise) and stuff with a cheddar and green chile mixture for a New Mexican style twist! Yummy!

Very good, I love garlic and my BF loves cheese so it's a win-win recipe. The shredded chedder cheddar was kind of hard to work with. Next time I think I will get the block of cheddar and grate it, mix it in with the bread crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Mmmmm, this was yummy.  I liked the combination of things in the breading and it created a nice crust after baking it.  Just a little dry because I forgot to drizzle the melted butter and garlic over the dish.  Next time I'll remember to do that.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  I made this for my sister and her family who needed a good dinner after driving 5 hours to get here.  It was a big hit.  Everybody liked it.  The only substitution I made was using grated parmesan instead of fresh shredded parmesan, and it was still wonderful!  The chicken breast was tender and moist and had great flavor.  If you're looking for a new spin on the same ol' chicken breast this is quick and delicious!  I'll definately be making this again!

Absolutely delicious with NO changes! There are lots of suggestions and variation for this recipe, but you don't even need them. I just pound my chicken very thin and follow the recipe as is.  Great chicken to go with a classic veggie and potato dinner.

I made this last night and it was amazing! I put bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan, and the chicken came out very crispy, not soggy at all as some breaded dishes do. I used fresh oregano and parsley and the flavors came out very well, I dont think the dried would've given it such nice flavor as the fresh. It was cooked perfectly after the 30 minutes

Very good! my only suggestion is for a side. If you like green beans, use the pot u melted the butter and garlic in without washing it to cook the grean beans. Throw a piece of bacon in and let it fry for a minute or so, then add the beans with a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Compliments the chicken well.

This is so good.  I like to make double for leftovers and it was next to impossible to keep my husband away.  I raved about it in work and several tried it that week and agreed.  What a pleasant change to boring chicken!

Of the two of us that tried it, one of us loved it, would have given in four stars; the other of us thought we used too much bread mixture, accidentally using twice as much as we needed. It was really good.  We'll definitely make this again, using the proper amount of bread mixture.

Great meal! I rarely follow recipes to the letter (I am from the Rachel Ray school of measuring) but this one was great as is. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, added a little more parsley and oregano, and used equal amounts of parmesan and cheddar cheeses. I also used another reviewer's tip and sprinkled the bottom of the pan w/ bread crumbs. The family really enjoyed this!

After reading the reviews, this is what I did: Instead of using 8 chicken breasts, I used 4 big ones and 1 tiny one, which fit in the pan perfectly. I did not scale the other ingredients down except the butter. I only used one stick (1/4 cup) of butter. I crushed up some ritz, saltines and corn flakes and used some dry bread crumbs to make one cup. I dipped the chicken in flour before dipping in the garlic butter. I used an aluminum pan, and sprinkled a generous amount of bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan so that the chicken would not get soggy. (I found that it was hard for the breading mixture to stick to the chicken). I baked it (uncovered) for 50-55 minutes, and it was delicious! The kids loved it, too.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the amount of effort (virtually none) with comparison to the juiciness and tastiness (tons!) that you get. Kids and hubby gobbled it up and were asking for more.

NICE! My husband absolutely loved these! I barely changed a thing!!! First of all, don't FORGET to pound the chicken to even thickness to ensure they get cooked in the same amount of time. **Hint: To pound the chicken--Use plastic wrap, double the size of your cutting board(lengthwise). Then place the chicken in between to avoid unwanted messy splatter.** I used panko crumbs mixed with Italian breadcrumbs for the crust with the other seasonings(omited the dried parsley). I put a little bit of flour(about 1/2 cup) into a ziploc bag with fresh chopped parsley(about a handful) and coated the chicken before the coat of garlic butter. Oh my, it turned out awesome!!!

Loved it! I didn't use any parsley because I don't have it at home, and I seasoned the chicken lightly with Goya Adobo in place of the salt and pepper the recipe calls for. I also used Progresso Panko bread crumps in PLAIN (the oregano & cheeses seasoned the panko bread crumbs.) I used an aluminum pan to bake the chicken and did not end up with a soggy bottom to it. And the panko added a great crunch, so I didn't need to use the broiler setting at the end of cooking time. Will definitely make again! Thanks Baylor66!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used panko bread crumbs and I didn't add the salt. I did have some problem with the bread crumb mixture sticking. I think I need to shred the cheeses finer. Next time I will pound the chicken breasts to make them all the same thickness.

The whole family loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to broil the chicken for the last 3 minutes of the cooking time which helped to crisp up the topping on top. I also lined the pan with some bread crumbs to soak up some of the grease.

This recipe is the one I started with, and have been hooked to this site since then. I sometimes pound the chicken thin, but slicing the breasts into thinner pieces (along the entire length) is just as good. The grocery store actually charges extra for thin cut breasts. Without slicing or pounding the breast, it can be so thick you have to overcook it (as to the breadcrumb coating) and you just lose some of this great flavor. I also don't use a 9X13 dish, I use a cookie sheet.  It seems to crisp up better and the breast pieces are not touching. I've passed this on to coworkers who all love this recipe.

I msde this pretty much exactly as written with 2 small changes. I did not flatten the chicken breasts and I used 50/50 olive oil/butter instead of all butter. Perhaps because the meat was thicker than had I flattened it, it took a few extra minutes in the oven but; it remained moist and tender. Will definitely make this again.

The chicken was juicy and moist. Very easy to prepare but the flavor (or lack of) was just okay.  I would not make this again.

I did not like this at all. I gave it two stars only because it was edible (with ketchup.) I love garlic, and I love cheese, but the taste of this dish (what little there was of it) was just not good. The funny thing is I have a chicken nugget recipe that I love that uses almost the exact same ingredients (minus the butter, garlic, and cheese.) Instead of being dipped in garlic butter, though, the chicken is dipped in canola oil. Maybe it was just the combination of butter, garlic, bread crumbs, and cheese that I didn't find palatable. Who knows. The chicken was juicy, though. I didn't pound mine flat, so I cooked them for an hour. I also spinkled some bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan, like others suggested, which kept the bottom from being soggy. I might have liked this chicken better if I hadn't spinkled the remaining breading over the breasts, like the recipe calls for. Too bad I'll never make it again to see if it'd taste better with less breading.

My Husband raved about this chicken the whole time he was eating it. I didn't have dried parsley, but had ground oregano. I also added some poultry seasoning and italian seasoning. Also added some more cheddar cheese at the end and broiled it as suggested. Very Good recipe!

This is an incredibly delicious dish! I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I substituted Italian croutons and French-fried onions (they were in a bag in front of the croutons, so I figured, what the heck?) and it turned out great. I also broil them for two minutes after the cooking time to make them a bit crispier. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was so delicious. I added a little bit more parsley and oregano than was suggested and it came out wonderful! I would definitely cook this again. Even my picky 2 year old loved it.

I am re-reviewing this recipe. This time I used chicken tenders so they were in smaller slices and it came out PERFECTLY. The flavor was wonderful. The first time I made it, the chicken breast was just too thick but with smaller pieces, it comes out perfectly!

Thank you for a great recipe! My husband raved and raved -- he's so hard to please when it comes to chicken & this one we both loved! Changes: added an extra clove of garlic, omitted salt from breading mixture and decreased cheddar cheese by about 1/4 cup. Figured there was enough salt in the cheese w/o having to add in extra. Personal pref. Chicken was juicy & tender w/lots of flavor. Will definitely be making again. I have made this 3x in less than 2 weeks that's how good this is!

We loved this recipe!  The garlic & butter gave it a lot of flavor.  My husband does not like cheddar, so I substituted mozzarella.  We'll definitely be having this again.

Delicious!  Only commments are:  Came out too salty...next time I'll leave out the salt as the cheeses are salty enough.  Also, fancy shredded cheddar would probably work better.....large shred didn't really melt or coat chicken easily.  Chicken was VERY moist. Only used 4 breasts too.....can't imagine how 8 pounded out breasts would fit in a pan.....Didn't pound them thin...too messy for me so I cooked with meat thermometer which took about 40-45 minutes to 165 degrees.  Will make again fur shur! :)

My husband and I are currently living overseas. Finding food that resembles something edible has been difficult and certain ingredients are difficult to find. This recipe made our week. You can also you Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I plan to use this recipe on a regular basis while we are out of the country and I’ll certainly use it to WOW my family when we get back home.

This chicken was excellent. I used the chicken boneless strips instead of the boneless breasts, so it made great chicken fingers. My boyfriend ranted and raved all night about how excellent the breading was...I will be making this very often!!

Just a little tip - whenever I make this in a pan or even on a cookie sheet, the bottom gets a little bit gooey.  To make it crispy all the way around, I just put the chicken directly on the oven rack, and place foil on the rack below to catch any crumbs.

Not really what I expected.  My husband liked it.  I also added corn flakes, as suggested by someone else.  I may try it again.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and I didn't modify my measurements.  So, the crust was too thick.  The meat was tender.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe is YUMMY!  Only differentce I made is I put the breadcrumb mixture (less the cheddar) in a ziploc baggie and after dipping the chicken pieces in the garlic butter I threw each one in the baggie and shook it around.  The mixture comes out well-mixed and coats the chicken evenly.  I put the some of the cheddar on top of the chicken before baking and the rest on top a few minutes before serving.

This was yummy!! It wasn't garlicky tasting enough for me so I will add more next time. I also added some more spices such as cayenne, pepper etc to the bread crumbs. I like my food spicy! This a great recipe and easy too!! ThanXx!!~

Next time I will use oil instead of butter cause my butter evaporated and all that was left was garlic and that didn't work very well so my chicken doesn't really have any garlic taste to it.  And next time i'll use Italian Bread crumbs for more flavor.  But overall it was pretty good.  I did use foil to cover the bottom of the pan and that worked out great.  I used fat free cheddar and no salt.  Today I am eating the left overs cold chopped up   put in a hot dog bun & I topped it w/ a Cheddar Parmesan Ranch Dressing i'm trying to use up, and it tases wonderful.

Awesome chicken!  The whole family liked it, and I plan to make it again next week.  I suggest using E-Z foil, I didn't even need to wash the pan.  The chicken came out of the pan beautifully, and all of that yummy crust stayed on the chicken.  Probably next time I will broil for a minute before taking it out of the oven, I did have a few 'soggy' patches, but that's probably my fault.  Tastes wonderful, and 'looks' nice, too.

My whole family of picky eaters thought this was heavenly. I am impressed at the speed and ease. I used 8 breast tenders, not pounded, and for the amount of breading, I could have cooked  8 more tenders. Impressive for guests. Thanks! It's a winner! I just made this again with breasts and it came out great again. Made the house smell divine, too. YUM!

This was yummy!!!    Both my boyfriend and his friend raved about it, (the friend acutally licked his plate!)  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and baked on a foil lined baking sheet and broiled for the last 5 min.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The coating was to die for, ;yummy, buttery, garlicy and crunchy!!  The chicken was a little dry but I think that may be my fault that I pounded too thin.  Also, the chicken breasts were on the small side, and 20 min. may have been a bit long to cook based on the size.  I did cut the recipe in half and was really scraping to get the last breast coated.  Next time I will make a bit more of the coating.  Over all, a super recipe and I will be making again!!!

I cant rate this yet but I am doing weight watchers.  This recipe looks awesome but I put in the nutrition fact to see how many points it was 10 that is a little high.  So I was able to tweek the recipe by subsituting the butter for Land O lakes Light butter with canola and Light Cheddar Shredded Cheese instead of the regular full calorie and fat versiion, which dropped to 7 points.  If anyone else has ideas of how to lighten this recipe please give me a shout.  I can't wait to try it!!!

Awesome...the whole family loved it...even the 3 and 1 year old!  Used a lot of dishes...that would normally be 
-1 star in my book, but it was really moist and delicious chicken.

Follow the advice of the other reviewers! This recipe is delicious, but the tips by other users are extremely helpful. My boyfriend and I loved this, and it was fairly easy to make. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent! We especially liked the bread crumb topping. Also served with ranch and blue cheese dressing to dip with. Yum. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  A great hit around here!  I also just use chicken thighs and cook a little longer.  Have also used cracker instead of bread crumbs.  A winner!

Loved it.Very easy to make. Followed the direction to a "T". We had some left over for the next night and when we heated it up I added more cheddar on top and it was even better. In fact when I make it next time about 5 minutes before its done I will add more cheese on top. Thanks for the recipe

Pretty good!  Chicken stayed really moist.  I will probably add more garlic to the oil and some chili powder to the crumbs next time.

Maybe I just dont like garlic or parmesan that much - the flavors were way too strong for me. I followed recipe exactly but cut the garlic in half and used italian bread crumbs instead of plain crumbs and the spices. The chicken did cook up nice so if you like strongly flavored chicken, this may be the dish for you.

Wow - this recipe was so flavourful and moist, will most definitely make again.  It was one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made.  My husband rated it a 5 star and said it was the best chicken he's ever had.  I did opt to cook it longer - for 40 minutes - and it was still very juicy and moist.  The coating was perfect.  Highly recommend making this recipe - thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Chicken was so moist and tender. Flavor was excellent! Although i would recommend using fresh shredded cheddar cheese. I used a name brand packaged kind and it didnt melt in the oven. Over all an absolute delight! *****

This is a favorite in our family since I found this recipe on allrecipes.  Absolutely delicious and very versatile (sometimes I like to use mozzarella cheese, too!).  This one's a keeper.

I was really disappointed with this. I did use preshredded cheddar cheese  and a brand name.  It never melted.  It tasted like a commercial frozen meal!  Not a keeper!

Awesome recipe! I converted this recipe to use 4 chicken breasts instead of 8. My family absolutely loved this meal. I made a mistake on accident and put in a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of a teaspoon but we liked it that way. We found that there wasnt too much garlic in the dish we enjoyed it (but my family loves garlic!) Other than that I didnt do anything different and it was awesome. Great recipe!! If your looking for something to go along with this meal I used Rice-a-Roni's Fried Rice and also made Italian Style Green Beans (just in case anyone was wondering what would be good with it.) :) Enjoy!

This recipe was sooooo good!  I added some sliced green onions to the butter/garlic mixture, and added some dried basil and paprika to the bread crumbs.  After I put the chicken in the pan, I topped it with more cheddar and parmesan cheese, some sliced green onions, and a dash of salt and pepper.  It came out great!

This chicken is absolutely fantastic!!!  I was a little leery that the cheddar cheese would be overpowering, and I am not a cheddar cheese fan.  But it added a delicious, non-overpowering flavor to it!  I hardly ever finish a whole chicken breast, but had no problem gobbling this up!  I made it last week and make it again tonight.  I did cook my chicken about 50 minutes instead of the recommended 30, and I turned it halfway through cooking, just because that's how I always cook my chicken.  It was extremely moist, even with cooking it longer.  I shared the recipe with my mom and she's making it this week as well!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I give this 3 stars, but my boyfriend gives it 5, so hence the 4 stars. Kind of a homemade shake-n-bake. I would have liked the breading a little crispier, so will stick it under the broiler for a couple minutes next time per other reviewers suggestion. The chicken did come out extremely moist and tender!

This was both delicious and very simple to make.  I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the butter/garlic mixture so I placed under the broiler for a few minutes...  this eliminated the sogginess and made the cheese nice and crispy - just the way I like it!

Fantastic recipe!  The chicken came out wonderfully moist and tender, and the breading had excellent flavour.  Not the healthiest way to prepare chicken, but definitely worth the extra calories!

This was so delicious.  My entire family loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except that I microwaved the butter and garlic.  My husband had a wonderful suggestion.  He thought it would be great if it were stuffed with a garlic cheese spread (like Allouette).  YUM!!  Thanks so much for this terrific new way of making chicken.  My family wants me to make it again real soon!

This was an excellent and simple dish to make. It took longer than the time requirement to cook.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes and then cranked it up to 450 for three minutes to crisp it up. Yummy!

Initially we found it lacking in flavor. We felt the recipe certainly had potential. After tweeking the method and ingredients somewhat. We found the flavor we were anticipating. For us, the key is to lightly message freshly crushed garlic (or granulated garlic), salt,pepper and a sprinkle of dry bones rub directly onto the chicken.  Next coat it with flour. Then dipped into the butter/garlic mixture. Our coating is finely crushed croutons combined with the suggested cheese/herb ingredients. We finish it with additional shredded cheddar. The result is a moist and flavorful main dish. We serve this with confidence! With adjustment 5 stars

Cheated a bit and use garlic butter but otherwise stuck to the recipe. This was a complete success. Rave reviews from the family and from me, very simple to make. Will be adding this  to the dinner Rota

I absolutely loved this recipe.  The chicken was perfectly tender while the bread crumb and cheese coating was just the right amount of crunch too.  And such a great flavor!  My husband is really picky and even loved it also.

I tried this out for lunch today, and it was okay but not great. It turned out pretty mushy. I think the garlic was a little much, and I LOVE garlic. I also didn't like how the cheddar cheese changed the taste. If I pan-seared it to make it crispy, I think it would be much better. Maybe grinding up some Chex cereal instead of breadcrumbs would make it crispier as well.

I can't speak for the measurements in the recipe, but this was great.  I had a giant chicken breast that was too big for one.  I eyeballed the ingredients and was pleased with the results. I didn't pour he remaining garlic butter on the chicken.  I  mixed it with some Rotini pasta and Parmesan cheese.  It was a good side for this.

My husband is super picky and gave this one an A+! I'm also not a huge chicken fan, because it's so "blah", but this was absolutely delicious. Didn't even need a sauce to flavor the chicken. Can't wait to make it again!

Very good, I added some dried onion flakes. Served it with a dipping sauce of Ranch dressing mixed with chili past. Easy and fast and kids love it served with baked fries. Thanks.

This is always a hit! My family loves the twist on breaded chicken! This time I used sharp cheddar and asiago not too mention adobo and Italian seasonings instead of the parsley and oregano! I made backed macaroni and cheese, cornbread and corn for traditional Sunday dinner!

This is so good!  We serve it with a butter lemon cream sauce over linguine.  My husband asks for it too many times!   I too have no left overs.  I Brown my garlic, and used tin foil under and it works really well.  I use sharp cheddar cheese and poured the remaining garlic and butter over chicken.  YUMMO!

Need it even quicker?  Melt butter in microwave then add garlic and microwave about 1 min more (70-80% power).  Pour butter mixture into baking pan add chicken and toss to coat.  Mix other ingredients in gallon plastic bag.  I used a combination of shredded cheddar, grated parmesan, and shredded parmesan. Pour half of breadcrumb and cheese mixture over chicken.  Press in.  Turn chicken over and pour remaining crumb cheese mixture on top.  Pat down and bake.  May need additional 5 minutes of cooking time but cleanup is a breeze!

Was really delicious.  After I dipped my chicken in the butter, I sat my chicken on a plate and seasoned it with paprika, onion powder and black pepper.  I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs.  I took the others suggestions and layered the bottom of my pan with saltine crackers and bread crumbs. I also broiled my chicken for about 45 seconds after it was done cooking.

The chicken was floating in butter by the time it came out of the oven, and the garlic was just a bit strong.  I would change the ingredients just a bit next time (less butter and garlic), but "this" recipe I give a 4 out of 5.

This was awesome. I did change the butter to a low cal version (I can't believe it's not butter light) and also a low fat cheddar. The result was fabulous. Would have this over and over.

It was good but not fantastic. The cheese and toppings formed a crust on top and came off, making it difficult to eat all together. It tasted good but not great.

We thought this was pretty good not great. I did not add the extra salt but next time I would add even more seasoning. It had the crispiness and crunch but was a little light on the flavor.

I was having a dinner party and couldn't figure out what kind of protein to make - I was so sick of always making chicken. But when I saw this recipe it sounded wonderful...and it was that and more! My company reacted just as yo usaid they would - there was NOTHING left and they all remarked about the taste and texture. I had 16 people from all different backgrounds and ethnicity, all different ages - all loved it. I did use Italian Bread Crumbs with garlic and herbs, and used sharp shredded cheddar. I didn't have a lot of juices in the pan - as a matter of fact I was worried when it was in the oven cause they looked a little dry while they were baking. But they were perfectly cooked and beond flavorful. A great company pleaser!

We liked the flavor of the chicken, but the bottom of the chicken was soggy.  Not sure if we will make this again.

Wicked good chicken. No a crumb left! So moist and juicy. Use panko bread crumbs and had a nice crispy coating. Used pre-shreaded cheese from Costco (cheddar and montrey jack). Lots of extra butter so might cut that down a bit. Kids told me I had better make that again!!! I used foil on the bottom and clean up was a snap!

Made this tonight, not only was it easy to make, it was delicious!   I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs since that's what I had thawed out.  I used sharp cheddar since I had that and whatever cheese mix was left, I put on the top of the chicken before baking.  Thirty minutes later, voila!  So good!!

This was awesome!!! Loved the 'swimming in butter' part! One thing I did change was the amount of parsley and oregano.  I kept adding more to the plain breadcrumbs until it looked like "enough". Probably about 3/4 to 1 tsp of each. Fabulous simple meal! :)

I made this for my Mother's Birthday at the beginning of July, My Dad askes for it every single day sense, and I have to tell him no because I cook many other things.  My whole family enjoyed this wonderful chicken, and I have sent it to half the people I know because it is so delicious.  I did not include Parsley, because I had none, but everything else was the same. Excellent!

Super easy and yummy, if you're looking for a quick dinner idea.  If you don't want to use butter, use evoo with garlic and just heat in the microwave instead.  I also put a little more cheese topping on after all the dipping and putting in the pan.  We love cheese in this household!

I already rated this once (as 5 stars) but had to come back and say that I tried this same exact recipe on tilapia instead of chicken and it was EXCELLENT! Only thing I changed was the bake time and the temp.

FABULOUS!! I eliminated the oregano - not my favorite seasoning. I also use Panko crumbs for half of the bread crumbs.  I do this with every recipe that calls for some kind of crumbs.

I made this tonight for dinner. I ended up following some suggestions of other reviewers and I also had to make some other changes. I bought bone in breasts on sale so used those. I cooked them at 400 and checked after 52 minutes. Then let them sit with a foil tent for about 10 minutes. Perfectly done. As far as the way I seasoned them...I marinated the breasts in Italian salad dressing for about five hours. Then I dredged them in butter with 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in it. The only variation to the breading is that I used italian style breadcrumbs and used cheap, not freshly grated parmesian cheese. I also sprinkled a tad bit of cheddar cheese on top of the breasts as I pulled them from the oven. The breasts were tender, had a good flavor internally, and the breading was delicious. Everyone loved it...including my two young kids and my in-laws. Thanks for posting the recipe and thanks for all the reviewers. I love getting good ideas from the things you all say.

My husband loved this, and my older daughter as well.  The picky 10 year old, not so much... but she doesn't like anything!  It's truly a heart attack on a plate made the way it's written, but I can't imagine making it without the butter.  It was cooked pretty thoroughly in half an hour, and I did start out with very large chicken breasts.

Used Panko breadcrumbs.  I also fresh grate the cheese.  Fresh grated seems to stick to the chicken better.  My husband and son love this recipe!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE - look forward to making more. I made Garlic Cheddar Chicken with what I had on hand- Italian store brand bread crumbs, Kraft plain old Parmesan cheese and sharp cheddar, and some white cheddar cheese powder I got from My Spice Sage. I couldn't get the mix to ‘stick’ to the breasts very well so with 10 minutes left baking left I sprinkled the reaming on the breasts. What spilled over made crunchy melted pieces that – TASTED great on their own – and these chicken breasts were OMG – wonderful. Look forward to trying again with fancy ‘panko’ bread crumbs!! I looked at the video AFTER making this – I did not pound the breasts thin – that missed action I will make sure I do next time.

We all liked this.  Would make less breading next time.  I used some plain and some garlic herb bread crumbs.  I didn't have fresh parmesan so I used a little of the canned variety.  Left out salt but it was still a little salty.  ETA: I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs tonight, and it was great!  I used the leftover garlic butter to saute some asparagus along with some lemon juice.  Way more butter than we usually eat, but the family liked it!

Never make this recipe if you don't like your guests.  They will never leave and they will always want to come back.

Absolutely delicious.  And pile on the cheese and breadcrumb mix.

The only thing I did a little differently was to broil for the last few minutes to make it extra crispy.

It was pretty good but the topping ended up getting a little burnt and the flavor was only pretty good.

Instead of bread crumbs, I crushed wheat crackers.  It gives it a cruncher taste and easier to keep on the chicken without falling off not like flour and bread crumbs.

I didn't have any Parmesan, otherwise followed directions as written. Great chicken!! Very moist and great flavor. Can you really go wrong w/ garlic, butter and cheese? :)

Brilliant and a definite make again.  Very easy to make and very easy to customize.  I used Panko, and got a really nice crunch to my chicken.

It was easy and delicious.  There are only two of us, so I had to reduce the ingredients, but used equal parts parm and cheddar.  I took the advice of one reviewer and used a beaten egg with the garlic instead of butter to coat the chicken and from another reviewer, I used my Bullet processor to mix all the dry ingredients together ~ it worked like a charm.  I sprayed my Pyrex dish and put a layer of the dry ingredients on the bottom before adding the coated chicken.  Will keep this tasty dish in my regular rotation.  Thank you!

This was a really good chicken meal for someone who doesn't normally like chicken. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and coated the bottom on the pan with Panko bread crumbs. I also rolled the chicken in flour before the egg and Panko to be sure that everything would stick.. and clearly I used Panko instead of normal bread crumbs.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I would of given it 5 stars, however I felt there was a little too much garlic.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time I will only use 2 cloves of garlic.  All in all a great recipe.

Yummy!! Thanks!  This is the most tender oven chicken I have had in years! We live in high desert(4200 ft.) so some of my recipes seem dryer,etc. I had read many of the reviews & took a few suggestions from them too.  I floured the chicken,dipped in butter & garlic & then the dry mix. I had no crumbs so used 99 cent pkg of home style garlic & butter croutons-crushed & sharp cheddar cheese. My pkg of chicken was 2.25 lbs. so I did not have much butter left over to drizzle & just a little of crumb mix--did add what I had & took advice from one reviewer...sprinkled a little extra cheese on for the last 10 minutes. One reviewer complained about the greasy bottoms, but mine were not that way..maybe because of more chicken.  I did notice that the butter was sinking to bottom as dish cooled--my suggestion--lift the pieces out of the baking pan & put them on a raised rack for a little bit. Note: using the garlic & butter croutons that I had on hand gave the dish an extra garlic zing!  I am a taster cook & was checking the chicken to make sure it was done--well, I kept eating that piece of chicken til' it was gone! lol. Thanks for the recipe..I am passing this one on to a few women--who still cook!  ( I am senior citizen & have been cooking & baking since I was 8yrs old.)  The last few years I have not been able to stand so long on kitchen floor to cook & bake...I loved to cook & bake for people who enjoyed my efforts.  I cook in larger amounts now & freeze & heat up leftovers for lat

Made this for dinner last night.  Absolutely scrumptious and husband loved it!  I used 1/2 plain and 1/2 seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also for added crispness, I used another reviewer's suggestion and placed a thin layer of coarsely crushed Texas Toast brand cheddar and garlic croutons at the bottom of the baking dish.   I  used Perdue's thin cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  At 350 degrees, it took longer than 30 minutes to cook in my oven so I turned it up to 450 degrees for an additional 15 minutes and then broiled the top for about 3-5 minutes.  Gave it a nice golden brown color and as I said - SCRUMPTIOUS!!

GREASY!!  Way too much butter.  It ended up greasy and soggy.  It was SO HEAVY and rib sticking- not in a good way.  It left me ill.  Also, for a family of 4, this recipe is WAY TOO much. I don't normally bread my chicken and prefer it on the grill but thought this would be different.  It's just so unhealthy you can feel it sitting in your stomach, ugh.  Maybe would be better with an egg wash and 1/4 of the breading and NO BUTTER.  Also, if you insist on still making this, I suggest more garlic- it was fairly bland.

Really good!  Even heating back up in the microwave, was still great. There is so many possibilites that would be good to do with the chicken leftovers like I think it would be good to cut into strips and add to speghettie or even make a chicken ceaser salad.  Also thought it would be good to put in a roll with sauce and parmesean..   Haven't done yet but I plan too!

This was a big hit with my family!  I will definitely make this again.  The only downside was all the oil/grease in the pan from the butter and cheese, but I'm not sure how to fix that without affecting the flavor.

Oh my!  This was delicious!!  The only things I did different is I didn't precook the garlic (I'm too lazy!) and I made it on aluminum foil on the grill because it was a beautiful day and I didn't want to turn on the oven!  Fantastic!

Yummy. Still got soggy on bottom even after following other reviewers' suggestions, but the flavor made up for it. I forgot to drizzle leftover butter but it was fine.

I used chicken tenders, put bread crumbs on the bottom of the casserole dish (genius!), use a handful of pizza cheese (had little left in the bag and I wanted to use it up) along with the cheddar cheese, panko bread crumbs instead of regualar bread crumbs, italian seasoning instead of the oregano and parsley (the grinder kind) and some ranch dressing mix.  The kids loved it so I will defintely be making again!

I don't regret my decision to make this recipe, but I can't see myself making it again.  It's not bad, just not for me.

OMG, this was fantastic. I did stray from the original recipe cause I didn't have any bread crumbs, but I did read one review that mentioned using croutons so I used the ones we had  which were "Fresh Gourmet Cheese & Garlic". I also only had 2 pieces of chicken which I did flatten, so I decided to cut the ingredients in half & WOW what an amazing flavor. I read some reviews that said there was not much of a "wake up" to the chicken & I think that they should make it again & just add a little more ingredients. This tastes fantastic. I made it after my wife went to bed so she will be having it for lunch tomorrow & I expect a call around lunch time praising how good this is ;) I will be making this again for sure. Thank You for this wonderful & very tasty recipe.

I made this but cut the butter by half and used olive oil...It was delicious but I found it had a greasy taste to it...my 1st thought was to cut the butter and/or oil completely and just dip in egg...I will go with my gut (no pun intended lol) and do it that way next time.....I will re-review when I do lol

What an excellent comfort food creation. cooked it about 35 minutes. Kids loved it. Next time I might melt a little more butter for the dipping part, but there was plenty of the dry mixture to put on top.

Awesome! Even my toddler loved this recipe! The only thing I didn't do was pour the remaining butter over the chicken. I thought there would be enough grease coming out of the cheese and I was right. I cut the recipe in half and it worked perfectly. Thanks for posting this! Yummm!

Made this exactly as written and it was delicious. The chicken was tender and the top was crispy. The bottom was not crispy. I served it with roasted vegetables.

Made this tonight and it was awesome!...So tender and juicy...Wasn't enough butter and garlic though for 8 breasts so only made 5...Next time will double the butter and garlic...Had plenty of the breadcrumb mixture...I used the Japanese Panko breadcrumbs as someone else suggested...I will never use anything but that again!...I loved the Panko!...I did put it under the broiler for around 5 minutes...Just sooo good!...

This recipe was okay. I don't think it was anything special. When I mixed all the ingredients together to make the breading it didn't taste any different than if I bought a packaged breading. I cut the chicken breasts into halves, lengthwise and then crosswise, which made smaller pieces. They baked up juicy and were not dried out. I would make this recipe again but  to me it was a regular, weeknight, baked chicken dish. The title makes is sound tasty but to me it just wasn't that tasty.

This really should be a five star, but I'm giving it four for two reasons.  My kids weren't thrilled with the garlic flavour, though they eat garlic in stuff all the time (weird kids) and I found I had WAY too much breadcrumb mixture left over, even after sprinkling most of it over top of the breasts in the pan.  Overall though, I thought it was fabulous.  Thank you for this recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, however I used the Perdue "Perfect Portions" garlic chicken w/white wine because that was all that was left at the store today. Thought it would be too garlicky but was not at all.  Everyone LOVED it, no leftovers!  This is a keeper!!

Good chicken, but it was a little dry, but I still give it 5 stars because it could have been my fault. I think I will use chicken thighs next time because they are more moist! This is another recipe to add to my menu! Thanks for sharing!

Big hit at our house, and oh so easy!  13 yr old pounded chicken flat while it was in a ziploc bag, super mess free ;-)  I coated it and we put in fridge covered with foil till ready to pop in oven.  The chicken was moist and tasty and not over powered with the garlic.  Yummy - going in the regular meal line up.

Fantastic!!! My family is full of cheese lovers so, I added a bit of more cheese! If you love cheese, I reccomend if you dont want more cheese on the chicken, cheesy mashed potatoes is what i had with it. I thought it made the perfect touch.

Made for "Men Make Dinner" day.  Straightforward recipe ideal for a great meal.  The coating was delicious.

Just a thought for the next time, leave out the salt, there's enough with the Parmesan and the cheddar.

Wow super tasty and pretty darn easy! I also used half the butter and a liberal splash of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Used 4 tb fresh minced garlic and an additional 3 tsp garlic powder. Didn't do the dried herbs at all, just let the cheese and garlic stand on their own. I also sprinkled breadcrumbs in a thin layer in my baking dish and added chicken on top as another reviewer mentioned, breadcrumbs moist but not soggy. My 14mo devoured hers and asked for more, fiance taking the leftovers to work to eat cold. :) Def a keeper with endless possibilities.

I made this for the first time when a friend had a baby. It was so easy to make, looks and smells amazing. I have since made it a few times for my husband and I. This is a foolproof recipe, needs no changes, and anything tastes good on the side. Twice I have made a broccoli, rice and cheese casserole on this website on the side-super yummy meal!!! Not the healthiest but who cares?!

This recipe was awesome!  I added a little more garlic than called for, but this was a total HIT with the family!  Will make again!

I thought this was incredible!  We are big garlic fans in this house so I added more garlic to the recipe - it was wonderful!  You also can't beat how incredibly easy it was to prepare - most certainly will make again!

It was really just "okay". It certainly wasn't bad, but with all of the yummy ingredients it calls for, I was expecting it to be awesome. I doubt I'll make it again.

My husband made this dish for me and I was so impressed! He is pretty new to cooking but he's did a great job on this chicken. We both liked it so much we ate too much! The only critique I have is that the butter was a little heavy, so next time I might suggest he do half butter/half olive oil.

I did not want to use the oven since it was so hot, so I cooked in microwave about 1/2 the time.  Turned out juicy and tasted good.  Will fix again.

I thought it was a 4 but bf kept going on how good it was. I added some cayenne to the spices for a little kick. I pounded the breasts which cut down on cook time & made them so tender. I ended up having to make more breading though about halfway thru.

Insanely good, and easy.  In addition, I clarified the butter before adding the garlic, which I only cooked for 3 minutes being careful not to burn it....  Also, I doubled or tripled the seasonings, and added Old Bay as well.  Trust me, do that.  As for the bread crumbs, I mixed seasoned (Italian) with Panko (for more crunch).  This is KILLER.  Also, it might not hurt to add some white wine in there, possibly to the baking dish....Sauvignon Blanc just goes with chicken, garlic, and cheese.

Really good!  It probably would have been better if I had fresh garlic and fresh parmesan.  Next time, I may add a little more garlic or spice.  Chicken was the most tender of any that I've made.

Delicious and simple!  The only thing I would change is sprinkling the shredded cheese on top instead of mixing it in with the coating because I found it didnt stick very well to the chicken and wound up cooked onto the bottom, so came off the bottom of the chicken anyway!  I will definitely make again as an easy weeknight dinner!

LOVE this recipe. So yummy! I like to add a little more cheese to the mix but otherwise I really enjoy this recipe. I've probably made it half a dozen times in the last several months. I recommend finely shredding the cheddar.

very good, but added more cheese out of habit as most recipes usually don't add enough to me, but with this, you really don't need to.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs.

I'm not the biggest chicken fan but my husband really liked this and kept saying "good chicken hon" even eating leftovers the next day.  He brought an extra breast into work and his co-worker really liked it too.  It has a nice garlic flavor and since I always use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular the texture was tender inside and light and crispy on the outside.  I might dip breasts in flour and egg next time because the coating barely stuck to the chicken when dipped in butter.  I basically had to spoon the topping over the chicken and pat it down so it would stay.  I had some really thick chicken breasts and even after pounding they were thicker than I like.  Next time I will pound them more or try cutlets and I think I will like even more.  My 8-year-old liked this as well and when he smelled the minced garlic cooking he couldn't wait to eat!

I loved this recipe!  I had to make a few changes  in an attempt to cut down the fat content.   I used olive oil instead of butter though I did throw a tbsp of butter into the olive oil for taste.  Instead of breadcrumbs, I used herbed stuffing (a personal preference).  I cut way down on the cheese, 1/3 c each.   I followed previous reviewers advice and put a little stuffing on the bottom of the pan.  I also covered the chicken with the leftover stuffing/cheese mix and the olive oil over that.   It was fabulous!  Sure I would have loved more cheese but the flavor was there.

It seems silly to add my voice to a recipe that already has 1,195 reviews, but I really wanted to commend and thank BAYLOR66 for submitting this recipe.  Definite five star from everyone in the family.  I read through a couple of pages of reviews, and didn't see any compelling reason to change anything from the original recipe, so I followed it to an S.  :-)  By which I mean, since I was halving the recipe, I cut back on the baking time a bit. Superb ... have already had requests from everyone to definitely without a doubt make it again.  Thank you!

Oh my, this recipe got an enthusiastic two thumbs up from everyone in the family! It was soooo delicious! I don't think it's low-cal, low fat or anything, but it was great! This recipe is a keeper!

Great. We dipped in egg instead of butter and just drizzled butter on top. I bought precut chicken breasts and only had 4 and I should have halved the breading recipe. We put all of the breading ingredients plus the garlic into a food processor to mix it up well.

What's so great about this recipe is the ability to modify it to your taste. Whether it's parmesan, mozzarella, or cheddar and whether it's bread crumbs or Panko, the results are always great!

Love this recipe! I used panko and sharp cheddar and didn't add the salt cause the butter already has it. The first time I had to improvise and almost stack the chicken in the pan. Had a bigger pan the second time and it made the top layer extra crispy and oh so delicious! I love it so much I've practically got it memorized so the next time we're at a loss at what to make for dinner, I can get the ingredients to this!

Very tasty and both kid and adult friendly. I used crushed cheese puffs instead of bread crumbs for more cheese flavor.

very easy to make and delicious! I used Italain bread crumbs so i omitted the parsley and oregano only b/c it was already in the bread crumbs I used. Whole family loved! I made these for my dad once who is a big beef eater, and he loved these, had seconds! I didnt add the shredded cheese on top until the chicken only had 10 min left. The first time I did it, the cheese got too crispy and looked burnt.

This recipe was pretty easy and tasty! I added a little extra breadcrumbs under the chicken as people suggested and it helped it not get soggy. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely try different variations of it again.

Taste great, love the garlic.  Used EVOO instead of butter, olive oil is much healthier.

Super good and easy weeknight recipe! I used "Mexican blend" cheese - that's what I had. I also subbed Italian seasoning for parsley and oregano - again, that's what I had.

I used saltines in place of bread crumbs.  I had to cook it for 60 minutes instead of 30. I thought 30 sounded like too little.  This is incredible.  My husband stuffed himself because he couldn't stop eating it. We will make this again and again. May try tenders next time instead of the larger pieces.

Received this recipe as the daily recipe a few weeks ago and just took a look at it when I was going through my e-mails.  I had chicken breast out for dinner and thought I would give this recipe a try since I had everything on hand.  As I was making it my husband said, "this is going to be awesome!"  We both were not disappointed, this is a keeper and we will be making this many times again.  I made it just as the recipe called, except I used 3 large chicken breast, but used the entire batter...DELICIOUS!  Thanks.

This turned out absolutely delicious.  I'm always trying to think of different ways to prepare chicken breasts.  You would almost think it would be cheesy, but I liked the crust topping.  It was also very flavorable.  I will definitely make this again and again and again.

I used thinner pork sirloin instead of chicken breasts: It was cheaper and that is what I had in my freezer.  I adjusted the cooking times too.  I also made a mushroom onion gravy with a can of cream of mushroom and chopped mushrooms and onions.  With all the butter I knew this wasn't going to come out super crispy so the gravy on top made it seem less greasy than it would have been without it.    Otherwise delicious!!!!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it turned out very tasty! I cooked the breaded chicken on a cooling rack on top of a foil-lined cookie tray and it was crispy and delicious! I did have a problem with the breading sticking, so I might alter the recipe next time to make the breading bind to the chicken better.

I have now made this two weeks in a row because my fiancée and I like it so much. I make my own bread crumbs with left over Cheezits, butter and garlic croutons, and Melba toast.

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner, and was very disappointed. The chicken had no flavor even though the recipe called for 4 cloves of garlic.  I served the dish with Jasmine rice and fresh steamed broccoli florets.  At least the sides were good. I will not make this recipe again.

it was awesome! I make it often. I don't bother to pound the chicken breasts - just use 'tenders'. Great the next day for lunch as well. I usually make a 9x13 pan full.

Both my husband and my daughter wouldn't even eat this.  The flavors were just all wrong.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated.  I personally stomached it, but will not be making it again.

My husband took one bite and loved it.  I liked it, but wasn't super-excited by it.  Of course, I had to make some minor changes as I didn't have what I needed on hand, and refused to make a grocery run, so it may be my own fault.  I love recipes you can adapt to what you have, though. Its definately one I will continue trying to tweak.  A great recipe to build on!

this was very easy and really really good! my husband loved it and said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's had. I agree !! only thing I did was add some french's fried onions w/ the breading (which I always do because they add the best crunch and flavor)_ Thank you for a delicious new way to prepare chicken!

Loved the flavor, but the breading wasn't crispy....followed someone advice and turned in the middle of cooking, and it still come out a little soggy.  I will make it again, maybe trying the panko crumbs others are talking about.

Chicken was moist but not very flavourful. Took about 45 minutes to cook through, maybe my chicken breasts were too thick.

Easy and delicious! I used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of panko (one of the other reviews sugggested the panko) - gave it a little more texture I think.  My family loves this chicken recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. It has a lot so much flavor. It will definitely be added to our family recipes. My boys each have their own recipe books for when they move out and they both asked me to add it to their books. It was a hit.

this is a great recipe.  i used a little more garlic as i do every recipe and i never use butter due to husband's cardiac restrictions, gut other than those changes, made as written and we both loved it.  i did bake it about 5 mins. longer and really felt surprised that it was done by then as i didn't pound out my chicken breasts,  but done it was and soooo mouth wateringly tender.  if anyone could tell me something to buy to pound chicken breasts, i would love it.   thank you.

We cooked two chix breasts, cut in 1/2 and pounded resulting in four breast pieces.  made no change to the seasonings; used Panko instead of bread crumbs; and used a little less butter.  Cooked as directed.  Absolutelu delicious.

Very good.....flavorful!  The only thing is I used only 6 chicken cutlets and I found I needed more breadcrumbs and cheese, maybe even could have used more than 1/2 cup of butter too.  But the flavor was great and chicken was very moist.....will for sure make again!

I think I died and went to heaven.  Granted, this recipe is deadly in terms of fat and salt, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't care.  My husband was a little worried about the health factor between the cheese and butter so I did cut the butter by about 1/3, but I feel like this recipe was easy, delicious and fulfilling and so you just don't eat it every single day.  Personally I don't worry about salt and fat, so this was perfect for me. I'm not one bit shy to admit that I nearly made a meal out of the crispy greasy bits on the bottom of the baking pan when it came out of the oven.  One serious note, I used thin cut chicken breasts, cooked them for 20 minutes at 350 as the recipe stated and then cranked it up to 450 for 5 minutes and it was perfect.  Also, I didn't use fresh garlic, instead just used some dehydrated garlic cooked in the butter for a minute or so.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've had in quite some time. I highly recommend it.  And I cut the recipe in half, and it worked well.  The chicken was tender and juicy!

I use this recipe when I can't think of any other chicken recipe.  It is so delicious, easy and quick to throw together.  The ingredients are those that tend to always be in the kitchen.   My bf loves it.  It even smells better the next day for leftovers!

The first time I made this my Husband said this was "the best chicken" I'd ever made... and I've made A LOT of chicken over the years!!!  I wouldn't personally call it the end-all, be-all BEST-chicken-ever, but it's soooooo EASY, uses ingredients always on hand, and it is quite good, so I still give it 5 stars.  This is a FANTASTIC weeknight staple around here.  And I use my handy-dandy Martha S. digital meat thermometer and remove it from the oven at 165d... (Depending on how thin you pound it) 30m cook time is usually too long and will result in dry chicken, 22-25m usually works for me.

Wonderful! in the BF's words "This is excellent"  I will take the previous suggestions and use olive oil for a healthier alternative and adding the cheese over the breaded chicken.  I used Italian bread crumbs, and also added them to the bottom of the pan to prevent it being soggy.  Also, broiled for the last 2 minutes for extra crispiness. Great flavor, moist, juicy, crunchy.  This WILL be in the meal rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a very tasty recipe!  I am giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because I did find the bottom of the chicken got a little soggy and I had some trouble getting the bread crumb mixture with the shredded cheese to stick well to the chicken.  However, I was just reading some of the reviews and see some suggestions to address those issues – such as putting a layer of bread crumb on the bottom of the baking dish to prevent the bottom from getting soggy and also dipping the chicken in flour before the butter mixture to help with the bread crumb mixture sticking better - So I am excited to try this recipe again – taking those suggestions into consideration.  Over-all it tastes great.

This came out looking excellent, but the flavor isn't anything out of the ordinary. It did go perfect with the meal I made however, and it wasn't hard to do. Next time, if there is a next time, i will do my own seasoning on the chicken prior to dipping it in the  bread crumb mix.

My family and I loved this recipe!  There are so many possibilites w/this, its great!  I took the advise of the 1st review and made the 1st 1/2 w/Panko. I made the 2nd 1/2 w/bread crumbs and they were both great!  I also added some garlic salt for a little more flavor.  I also read a review about adding bread crumbs to the bottom of the pan before baking, I thought that was a great idea, but it didn't work out for me, maybe I did something wrong b/c it caused my chicken to burn on the bottom.  The pans that I didn't presprinkle w/bread crumbs turned out better (I doubled the recipe).  No big deal though, it was fantastic all the way around, anyway we made it.  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great!  I recommend Panko bread crumbs - they are awesome for crispiness.  I followed everything to a T and it was perfect.

I made this exactly to the recipe.  This had great flavor and smelled great while baking.  My kids liked it, but did not want seconds.  I kept tasting the strong flavors for hours afterward.  I don't think I will put this into my regular rotation.

I couldn't really taste the cheddar in this. I think next time I will top mine with cheddar cheese and not add it to the breadcrumb mixture. I am not that big of a fan of breadcrumb coating on my oven baked chicken, so I think I will use panko breadcrumbs next time. Very good and the kids liked it!

Great and easy recipe!  My only suggestions would be to omit the salt (because of the cheese) and I also chopped the shredded cheddar cheese a little finer so it stuck better to the chicken.  I followed the other suggestions of putting a little layer of breadcrumb mix underneath the chicken in the pan before baking.  Very yummy and easy and my picky 4-year-old liked it too!

WOW! This was wonderful, I only used half of the butter and followed other peoples suggestion to broil the chicken at the end to make it slightly crisp. It was delicious! My husband and mother in law raved about this after dinner and my husband said I could make it again the next night! We will be making this again soon. Thanks

Loved the taste! It did turn out pretty mushy, even though I lined the pan with foil and sprinkled bottom with bread crumbs. I also broiled for a few minutes at the end of baking, but it didn't help the mushiness...I think I may have overcrowded the pan and possibly used too much of the bread crumb/cheese mixture over the top of chicken. ??  I will definately try this one again because we LOVED the flavor!

These are tasty. However, for health reasons, I had a hard time with all the butter called for. I sauteed the garlic in a bit of olive oil, then pressed the "top" of each breast into the garlic oil before breading. I drizzled just a bit of melted butter on each breast before putting in the oven. I used panko bread crumbs and it had a nice crispy texture. I will make these again, the guys even remarked they liked them! Thank you!

I halved the recipe and we didn't have any left, but we definitely WANTED more! I guess I'll make the full recipe from now on! I used olive oil instead of butter and panko crumbs rather than regular bread crumbs & it tasted like a restaurant quality preparation.

I make this recipe again and again!  My kids love it and it can be frozen uncooked then placed in the crockpot for a make-ahead easy dinner.

I know others loved it and we love garlic and cheddar, but it just wasn't for us.  I found the garlic too overpowering.  Maybe cutting down on the garlic would help, but I will try other recipes instead.

This was really good.  My husband is not too fond of chicken breasts, but he really liked them this way.  They stayed moist and had a great flavor.  I did make a couple of changes based on our tastes and other's suggestions.  I pounded the chicken to make it thinner.  Then I let the pieces marinate in italian dressing for about 1/2 an hour.  Next I dipped the pieces in the butter and garlic (I added more garlic as we are garlic lovers.).  Then I dipped them into the cheese and bread crumb mixture but instead of adding parsley, oregano, pepper and salt, I just added 1 t of Italian seasoning to the mixture.

Absolutely Delicious!! The only change I made was I used panko bread crumbs. I have made this twice and came out great both times. Thanks for sharing.

This was INCREDIBLY good and easy.  I did follow some advise of other cooks.  I mixed the ingredients in the food processor to mix them up well and I sprinkled some bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan so the chicken wouldn't stick. Next time I will use more butter and less bread crumbs.  It was TENDER and JUICY and everyone was quiet around the table as they ate! :)

I only had two breasts to cook tonight so I adjusted the ingredients and decided to cook them on the stove to avoid turning on the oven. Big mistake! The outside burned before the centres were cooked. Next time I will cook them in the oven no matter the portion I'm making. The crust (parts that weren't too badly burned) tasted great, and with some more garlic this would definitely be very good. Worth another try for sure!

The whole family loved this dish.  We used Kraft Parmesan and Romano grated cheese and italian seasoned bread crumbs since that's what was in the pantry and it turned out great.  We have also used this recipe for tilapia (shorter cooking time). Yummy!

This was so easy and tasty! I did add some bread crumbs to the bottom of the pan, but the bottoms of my chicken was still soggy. Not that it changed the taste or the overall appeal! I will be making this again!

This is a delicious recipe and very easy to make. I used chicken tenderloins which are easier to eat for kids but I gave it only 4 stars because it did come out soggy on the bottom after baking. Next time I'll bake it on a wire rack and it'll be 5 stars!

I would give this a five, but I didn't have bread crumbs, and don't like to rate things a 5 when I didn't use the true recipe.  That said I LOVED this recipe.  We do have leftovers but completely on purpose.  My only compliant abotu this is it was swimming in grease, but the chicken didn't taste greasy at all.  I will ABSOLUTELY make this again.  Thank you thank you thank you!!

I don't know.  It was okay.  It was tender and flavorful, but just not sure if we were crazy about the flavor.  It was a bit overwhelming with the Cheddar & Parmesan.  If we make it again it will be with a bit less Parmesan and maybe not use Sharp Cheddar.

I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs, which made for a crisper texture. I thought it was good but not great. My three boys loved it, though.

Liked it, I’ll probably try again but with a few modifications. I listened to some of the advices I found here and covered the bottom of the baking dish with some bread crumbs, so the chicken wouldn’t stick (thought it was better than foil, because it the foil sticks in the chicken it would be a disaster). Anyway, that worked out perfectly. I just thought the chicken was a bit dry. I seasoned the chicken like I usually do, coated them with all purpose flour, dipped into the melted butter and then coated it with the bread crumb mixture. The chicken tasted great but it was kinda dry. I don’t know, maybe I’ll try to brine it the next time, maybe it will help. I’ll either do that or bake it with tiny slices of butter in the baking dish (like I saw in another chicken recipe here).

Amazing! The chicken came out very tender and juicy, and full of flavor. I left the recipe as is, only adding some crushed french fried onions to the breading mixture. This was a huge hit with my boyfriend, so it will definitely stay in the rotation!

This turned out really well. We were pressed for time and wanted something good but fast. This was it!! I had 6 chicken breast halves, which I pounded thin. I didn't have the full amount of cheese (a cup maybe) but it was still great. We are garlic lovers so I added a bit more than called for. I think that what would have sent this over the top was to have even more garlic in the bread crumb mixture. I will try that next time! Thanks....

Fairly easy and quick to make. Next time I will use finer grated cheese. With all the butter and cheese, the drippings are great for sopping.

This recipe has potential - used the panko breadcrumbs as other suggested and they were great.  I didn't care for the cheddar cheese, however.  The taste didn't seem to fit.  Next time I will try mozzarella or monterey jack for a different flavor.

This is by far the BEST chicken recipe ever!!! I have just baked it and can't get enough. I would not change anything (I used cajun seasoning instead of pepper because I ran out:) AWESOME!!!

A big hit with the family. Followed recipe exactly, pounding the chicken breast first, and spreading a thin layer of bread crumbs in the dish as others suggested.  Put under the broiler for the last minute or so, giving us crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside yumminess!

Followed almost to a T. I didn't have plain bread crumbs so used Italian seasoned crumbs (omitted the parsley because the crumbs already contain it).  I also used the tip of another reviewer to run the crumb mixture through a food processor so it coats better (highly recommend this step).  I didn't bother pounding the chicken as I knew that leaving them whole would still produce juicy chicken (with the oil from the butter and cheese). Just ensure to extend the cooking time (I cooked mine for 50 minutes - had thick breasts).  This is really good and melt in your mouth, very attractive looking.  Having said that, I think I like "Butter Chicken" (another recipe on this site) a little better as it is the same idea but less work.  The cheddar taste was not as pronounced as I thought (which turned out to be a plus for my kids as they're not really a fan of melted cheese).  I would make this again and for company.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good and I'll definitely make it again, but with some changes next time. I thought there was a bit too much butter, so I will cut back on that - as another reviewer mentioned, the breading was a bit soggy. I think next time, I'll experiment with crushed cornflakes or some other cracker crumb for the coating. Otherwise, the flavor was great, and it's an easy dish to prepare. Thank you!

This was really good, but it didn't get very crispy.  I put some bread crumbs in the baking dish first, and it helped a bit.  Next time I will use more garlic, maybe put some in with the bread crumbs.  Overall it was very good, and I will make it again soon.

This was absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of the other reviewers, put the bread crumbs down first and didn't mix the cheddar (used a smokey cheddar, yum) in with the dry mix.  After cooking the chicken for 20 minutes I put the cheddar on the chicken and broiled them for 5 minutes.  Delish!

This was very good! The only change I made was to use a little more than 1/4 cup of olive oil and a couple Tablespoons of butter. It wasn't greasy at all. We'll surely make this one again!

Absolutely Yummy & I did'nt make any changes at all!! I did however place it under the broiler for 3 minutes on each side though.

Everyone loved this so much, will be making it again tomorrow and will use the tip of sprinkling bread crumbs on the pan first to make it get a little crispier. ;-)

Thanks Much For This Awesome Chicken Recipe

Okay, I don't know what I did wrong, but this turned out horribly for me--the breadcrumb mixture on the chicken tasted like sand. I am only giving this three stars because I figure I must have done something wrong considering all of the other great reviews.

I followed the recipe exactly, and seemed to get the results that others did, by the looks of the pictures. I was sure that the cheese would get all melty, but it stayed in little strips on the chicken. It was definitely a different way to do chicken for me, and I will definitely make this again if I have a craving for cheesy chicken! Gave it a nice, unique flavor.

Oh man this was good chicken!! I did everything as written except I used seasoned bread crumbs, so I omitted to other seasoning. Also, after they were done I put them under the broiler so the tops would get crispy. Will definitely be making this again!

This was a hit at our house!  I use the 3 cheese blend instead of Cheddar and I also scaled down the recipe to 4 servings...which was still a lot!  My son, who rarely eats meat, loved it!  I think I will make this on a routine basis!  Lots of flavor!

The whole family liked this recipe - it even got several "this is really good" comments.  I used 1/2 plain bread crumbs and 1/2 Italian. I also added a dash of garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture. Made it with a stick of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  Did not have much butter left after dipping chicken so I sprayed the coated breasts with a little Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray.  Next time will use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil as others have suggested. Will definitely go into the rotation at my house.

I was ready to give this five stars before it even came out of the oven. It smells so good! turns out... it tastes good too.  (Only one change, left out the salt. It stands just fine without it.)

YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!! It was delicious!....to the bread crumb mixture I also added onion powder and garlic powder...and took others advice on lining the bottom of the pan with bread crumbs so the chicken doesn't get soggy. I also  breaded the chicken in flour before dipping into the garlic butter, which helped the bread crumb mixture stick a lot better! It turned out sooooo moist and delicious, will defiantly go into the rotation. thank you!!

This was excellent. My only gripe (and the reason I didn't give it five stars) is that the coating fell off very easily like when you would cut it. Next time I'll take the advice of some other reviewers amd flour the chicken first before coating it with breadcrumbs and the garlic butter. All in all though, a winner. Tks.

The flavor was good (I used seasoned bread crumbs, and crushed fried garlic-pepper onions), and the hubby enjoyed the meal. I dredged the chicken in flour before dipping it in the butter. It was still a bit soggy on the bottom (even with the extra bread crumbs sprinkled in the pan), but the chicken was very moist and tender. I'll try this again, and may flip the chicken over fot the last 10 minutes of baking.

This dish was absolutely delicious. My entire family raved about the different flavors the chicken produced. The only difference was adding 1.5 times the amount of garlic and parm cheese, and it worked out great. After I coated the chicken with the breading, I poured the remaining butter and garlic, and then sprinkled some of the cheese breading on top. Came out perfect. I did have to melt another 1/2 cup of butter, however, for the second coating. The only change I'll make next time is I'll take the advice of another reviewer and coat the pan with breadcrumbs before baking. The bottom of the chicken was a little soggy.

Really good stuff! Simple to make as well. I will use 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil next time though, and cut back the amount.
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I've made this a few times now and each time everyone has loved it. The Chicken is lovely and moist as the crust seems to hold all the moisture in the coating adds a nice crunch and flavour through the chicken without being overpowering. I usually serve this with potato wedges with a sprinking each of chilli powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper and olive oil baked in the oven. Thanks for an easy tasty recipe.

Very good recipe.  I made this for a family of five that was visiting us.  Surprisingly, none of the three kids liked it, but both of the adults did.  They both asked me to send them the recipe.

This recipes has inspired so many delicious ideas.  I like to add different spices or cheeses to the bread crumbs.  Once I added fresh thyme to the garlic and butter.  The recipe is just a great base for new ideas and it is also perfect as is.

This was good, but a little soggy. I did bake it covered, so I may have baked it the wrong way than intended. I baked it for about 10 minutes more uncovered to brown it up and the chicken crisped up a bit. Very tasty overall.

My husband asks for this dish!  I used Panko bread crumbs and it added a nice crunch.  To tenderize the chicken breasts, I also pounded them out slightly with the flat edge of a meat mallet before dipping in the garlic and butter.   I very highly recommend this entree, paired with Rice a Roni rice pilaf variety and a steamed veggie of your choice.

This is a great recipe. Not only is it easy but it tastes great also. I have some picky eaters and when everyone loves the same dish it is definitely a keeper. I always followed this recipe as is but next time I am going to try sprinkling bread crumbs in the dish as someone had mentioned. Thanks!

This was SO good. I did add an extra clove of garlic (we love garlic) and all I had on hand was a pre-shredded mix of Cheddar and Jack cheese.  My whole family (7) loved this and some of us are picky eaters.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I did use less garlic than called for because I don't like a strong garlic taste.  One clove was enough.

Seems a bit caloric but worth the splurge! I used to make a similar garlic chicken recipe using Lipton garlic soup mix. I'm dropping that recipe and using this one instead! It's so much better. I served it with mashed potatoes, which worked great with the buttery, cheesy drippings.

The concept of this dish is great, but the greasyness of the dish was a little much. Perhaps an egg bath is more appropriate than butter. If you add garlic straight into the breadcrumbs, that takes care of the garlic flavor. The bottoms of my chicken were soggy from all the standing butter. I will keep working with this recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe, and he frequently requests it. 
I follow the recipe, except I add a little more Cheddar cheese. I love the unique combination of the herbs, and the melted cheese is just the perfect complement to the overall flavor. This recipe turns out just right every time. 
This chicken is wonderful when paired with creamy mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli as side dishes.

This chicken dish was very tasty, and very easy.

I used mozzerella instead of cheddar and italian seasoned bread crumbs. I thought it was a perfect flavor combination.

This was absolutely delicious!  I bathed the chicken breasts in butter and 4 cloves of sauteed garlic, then breaded them.  I also used Asiago cheese instead of parmesean.  YUM! :)

This was excellent.  I did make a few changes.  I used minced garlic from a jar and added some lemon juice to the butter.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and just used Parmesan from a bottle (not  freshly grated.)  I only made half a recipe.  The chicken was nice and juicy and not too garlicky.

Incredibly tasty and incredibly easy!!  I lightly oiled my baking dish with olive oil and sprinkled down a thin layer of bread crumbs. As I always do, I used twice as much garlic than the recipe called for.  Best new chicken recipe I have tried in a long time (especially because how quick & easy it is!!)

WOW!! This is tasty, easy and fabulous!! I did not pound the chicken breasts, so it took about 40-45 minutes to bake at 375 (I cooked at a higher temperature than stated). I also used Italian bread crumbs so I omitted the parsley and oregano. I followed another reviewers suggestion of putting bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan to help with sogginess. This is a  superb chicken dish. I served it with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad also from this web site.

Instead of number of stars, I should be able to rate a recipe by the number of complaints that I get from my 7, 5, and 3 year olds.  This is a record breaking chicken dish because it not only did not elicit a single complaint from my children, my  painfully picky 3 year old cleaned her plate and asked for more!!!!  I made the recipe just as written (minus the pine nuts) and didn't have a problem with sogginess on the bottom.  I do agree that pounding the chicken flat is key.  What a yummy meal and how uncharacteristically gratifying to cook for my children for once!!!!!!!

Pretty darned good, easy and quick!  Great for a weekday meal. My 11-year old picky daughter even had seconds.  That, in itself, says a whole bunch!  The chicken was extremely moist, tender and loaded with great flavor!  The cooking time was absolutely perfect.  And, boy does it make a HUGE difference when you pound your chicken breasts (usually I don't):P  Also, definitely for garlic lovers -- we are, however, my daughter woke up the next morning and said she still tasted the garlic -- oops!

This recipe is my husband's absolute favorite! And it's so easy to throw together. For a yummy alteration, I like to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. It just makes the flavor explode! You'll love it!

Made this dish tonight and it was FABULOUS.  I used Itailan breadcrumbs instead of plain but omitted the extra spices the recipe called for.  I did everything else as listed.  I was surprised at how flavorfull this recipe was and will be making this a regular meal in our home (especially since my toddler ate it up..usually the only way we can get her to eat chicken is if they are nuggets)!  Thanks.

This was a really good chicken dish.  I used 3 large breasts and did not pound thin.  Used a shredded cheese blend and probably double the garlic.  I think I added too much of the left over coating on top of the chicken after putting in the dish because the topping was a tad too rich/much.  The taste is great though and the chicken was really moist which is a huge plus and one reason why I didn't pound them.  My husband loved them and my 8yr.old son thought it was ok but he doesn't like chicken to begin with so I guess even eating any of it was success for him.  I hadn't taken anything out for dinner and when we got home late from a b-ball game I whipped this up in a jiffy, it's a great last minute meal!  I made the "screaming potatoes" from this site with this and I reviewed that recipe as well along with asparagus.

The only thing I did differently was I used italian bread crumbs. I made this for a friend and myself and it was a big success. Very tasty.

i made a half recipe of this yummy dish without alteration aside from using 3 plump garlic cloves. note: for an even crispy texture turn over your chicken breasts 5 minutes before they're done baking. many thanks baylor!

Oh my goodness! This was HEAVENLY!! This is actually the second time I've made it, and I get so many compliments! I use cheddar bread crumbs instead of plain ones, but I really don't think that makes much of a difference. The chicken was just so incredibly juicy, I couldn't get over it! I will definitely be making this quite a bit in the future!

This is one of my favorite dishes to make. It is a hit every time. Last time I made it I was out of bread crumbs so I toasted some bread and crumbled it up instead. It worked great! And it's really good with whatever cheese you have on hand. Great recipe...thanks!

This recipe was great! The only thing that I think I will do different next time is only coat the chicken with the bread crumbs after dipping them in the garlic butter to coat it better then add cheese last. I was having a hard time getting the cheese to stick when it was mixed in with the bread crumbs. But other then that this chicken recipe came out tender and juicy with lots of flavor. Thanks for sharing =)

This recipe is wonderfully delicious.  It just melts in your mouth and what I love the most is that all of the ingredients you need are staples of a pantry, so you don't have to run to the grocery store at the last minute.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was just ok.  I too used half butter/half olive oil.  I also cut slits in the chicken to insert slivers of garlic.  Thought the flavor was slightly bland.  Needed more of a kick.  Might make again if I need a quick dish but definitely not my favorite.

It was an o.k. recipe.  I was hoping it would have been more gooey cheesy.  It also was a little oily-buttery.

Awesome!  Very moist, full of taste.  My son who doesn't like much meat at all LOVED it!  Will definitely make again, to the very letter of the recipe.  Although, next time I will shred the cheese "fancy" style for better coverage on the chicken breasts.

This was great....another winner to add to my growing collection.  Made is just the way it's written, except cut in half, and only used 2 breast.  As I boned and skinned them myself, by the time I pounded them out, the 2 of them filled my 9X13 baking dish.  This is a keeper, and will do when company visit.  Will also experiment with other types of cheese.  Oh yea, I forgot the garlic,(duh), but it was still awesome.

This is definitely one of THE BEST chicken dishes I have ever had.  The chicken turned out so moist and tender.  The flavor was super fantastic. It had just the right amount of spice to it. Even my husband, who normally doesn't like garlic, loved this dish.  It was not a boring dish, but not so over the top that my four-year-old would turn her nose up at it.  In fact, my daughter loved it too.  I will be making this one again and again!  Heck...maybe tomorrow!

I just have to review this one again. This is a family favorite...incredibly moist, perfect every time.  Make sure you really drench the chicken in the butter mixture and the crumbs will stick beautifully - don't skimp on the butter.  It's so tender you may not think it's cooked at first, but 30 min. always works perfectly for me.  If you want, broil on low last 3-5 minutes (watch closely).  With all the butter, never sticks to my pans...easy cleanup.

Good the first time with cheddar, but a little bit on the bland side. The second time I used spicy jack cheese and it improved it a lot.

Tasty and moist chicken! I replaced half the butter with olive oil and used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of regular.  Thanks!

Used the breading mixture on boneless pork chops and was very pleased.  Can't wait to use it on chicken soon!

This chicken was great!  Next time I will use a little more butter though because I didn't seem to have quite enough.  But overall I couldn't believe how moist the chicken was - ubelievable!

My husband loved it, he's a garlic-aholic.  I wasn't impressed with it.  I thought it was a little soggy.  I'll probably make again and like others have said, cut back on the butter and see if that makes a difference.

Mixed reviews at our house.  My daughter just LOVED this dish!  However, my husband and son were not impressed at all.  This was super easy & fast to prepare, and it smelled wonderful while baking.  The chicken was sooo tender and moist, and the topping was delicious.  But, even for a serious garlic lover like me, it was too intense, and too salty.  The garlic permeated from me for nearly 2 days after eating this.  I enjoyed it, but I'd probably recommend the following changes:  1) Cut the garlic down to 2 cloves, 2) Eliminate the salt altogether as the parmesan is naturally salty enough,  and 3) Replace half of the butter w/ olive oil to elimate some of the saturated fat.

My husband and I thought this dish was just average.  We love garlic and cheese, but thought this recipe needed more flavor.  I won't be making it again.

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any parsley so I doubled the oregano.  Like someone else suggested, I used kitchen shears and cut the chicken breast into strips so it was easier to eat and serve.

I decided to spring this recipe on my family tonite as it has all the ingredients we like.. (garlic and cheese..yummy)...  As I have very picky eaters, I was a bit hesitant.  But, I was delightfully surprised to hear from my "chicken hating" husband that it was absolutely delicious!  I made it with a side dish of creamy potatoes...but will take my husband's suggestion of adding alfredo sauce and noodles to it.  In any case, it was very good and I'm glad you shared this recipe.  Made "boring" chicken wonderful and it was sooo easy!!

Great flavor.  Moist chicken.  Lined baking sheet with foil sprayed with Olive Oil Pam based on other reviews.  Add more shredded cheddar the last 5 minutes of cook time for gooey top.  Yum!

Great recipe!!!!!!!!!!! I followed the instructions as is and it turned out great. A little crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I set the chicken in the bread crumb mixture then grabbed a handful of the mixture and smashed it on top of the chicken. Then turned it over and repeated. This recipe will be used over and over. Thanks.

Ok, yummmmmmm.  We really enjoyed this.  I did use a little less butter and used the rest of olive oil.  Did broil at the last 5 minutes. Everyone enjoyed.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and some zucchini stir fried with garlic and basil and just a touch of chicken boullion and balsamic and parmesean cheese!  Great dinner.

I don't think I have ever had such moist chicken!  Yummy!  This was so good, the kids were picking at the coating in the pan.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used a packet of shake n bake and everything else stayed exactly the same. Thanks for sharing a keeper!

Fixed this chicken today and it was GREAT!! So easy and so tasty. I did not pound my chicken too thin as I like them a little plump and they turned out fabulous.  Just baked 5 minutes longer. Thank you so much.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was very yummy! The next time I make it though I'm gonna use unsalted butter cause I'm not big on salt and neither are my parents, and it was just a tad bit salty using the Parma chees, butter, and salt.. So we are cutting back on that, but other than that, wonderful dish! Very tasty and super easy!!

I made this tonight but since my family is small I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it turned out great. The only thing I did different was I left out the shredded cheddar cheese and just sprinkled it on top. covered it and baked at 350' for 40 minutes. I was surprised at how much flavor this had. I wasn't really expecting that but we all loved it. Even my toddler did and you know how picky kids can be! Thanks for sharing. I plan to make this again.

The spices didn't come through as much as I would have liked, but this was really good.  Next time, I'll add a bit of dill weed, and a bit of Old Bay Seasoning for a more intense flavor. BTW, I used Heart Smart butter instead of real butter and it was very delicious.

This is a delicious dish and an easy recipe to follow. The first time I made this, I knew it was a keeper because my husband wanted leftovers to take to work the next day, and he never before would eat leftovers.  I've also made this dish with some minor changes, and it was very good that way, also. Instead of Parmesan alone, I used Parmesan/Romano grated cheese.  I also substituted shredded Colby/Jack for the cheddar cheese.  Finally, I used Italian flavored bread crumbs. If you've ever been to Leona's (in Chicagoland), this is very similar to their Romano Crusted Chicken. Wonderful!

This is really good.  I did marinate my chicken in italian dressing first and added extra cheese for the last 5 minutes in the oven.  Amazingly it is even better the second day!!  I will make this again and again.

This is great.  Even my chicken-loathing boyfriend said it was good, so that's saying ALOT.  I only changed one thing and that was that I marinated the chicken overnight in 3-Cheese Italian Salad dressing because I had it and wanted to use it up.  So I did that instead of the garlic butter part.  Will definitely do this one again!

This was ok. I didn't think the flavors meddled together quite right, and hubby and I both prefer the regular Garlic Chicken recipe on this site. Don't think I'll make this one again, but thanks!

Great for the garlic lover. This came out tender, juicy, and I enjoyed the crispiness of it. The cheese firms up into bits which add a nice subtle flavor to the chicken.

Made this for the second time last night and it is honestly one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made!!! I covered the cassarole dish with foil and used Italian bread crumbs. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I didn't flatten the chicken and it was so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Thand you BAYLOR66 for this recipe!!!!!!

Dry! (and I checked meat after 20 minutes, and it was done)  My husband liked more than me (4* for him), but I know how much butter and other bad stuff went into this.  Frankly, the flavor didn't live up to the calories.  Maybe if you don't flatten the chicken it'd be better??

Easy and delish, my two favorite words when used together. The family said the smell remimded them of the spices in good pizza crust..which we love.  I made enough so we would have leftovers and they were great as well.  This one is a keeper!!

We had leftovers, but only because there were only two of us eating. Every crumb disappeared the next day! Excellent recipe for beginning cooks, and great basic recipe for more advanced chefs to start with and substitute or add other seasonings to. Ingredients are also basic stuff that is usually in the cupboard.

All I can say is, make this recipe as soon as you can! We're garlic lovers so I used a whole head. I put half in the butter and the other half into the bread crumb mixture. Amazingly good!! Thanks so much!

Really delicious. I needed about 45 minutes to get the chicken cooked though. Instead of breadcrumbs, I used crushed reduced fat ritz, and I used reduced fat margarine instead of butter. Although I had only 4 chicken breast halves, they were very large, so I used all the same spices, but eyeballed the amounts, using 3 garlic cloves. I used closer to a full cup of cheddar cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan. We ate this with mashed potatoes and it turned out great. Loses a little something reheated in the microwave the next day, but it's stil good.

Well, my cheese-loving 13 yo daughter and I LOVED this recipe.  However, my 9 yo boy who doesnt like cheese wouldnt eat it.  My husband, who has a very sensitive stomach, esp to butter, and only likes uncooked cheese, asked that we not have this again.  It was 'soggy', but i think it was actually the butter making it soggy.  I also think the cheese would have distributed better if I had shredded it smaller.

We were looking for something different when it came to cooking up our chicken breasts, and boy is this a keeper! The breading really held together. I like the addition of the cheese to the bread crumbs, but then again, I like cheese.

This Chicken was great.  I had a hard time getting the bread crumb mixture to stick to the chicken, so I ended up just putting all the leftover mixture on top of the chicken in the dish.  Really turned out good.  Everybody said they liked it and my husband wants me to make it again.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

EXCELLENT! I agree with sosweetisme and Lauren2170...just delicious. I have found that if you use a regular type pan to cook this in, NOT a non stick..it cooks up way more crunchy. Also, if you toss the ingredients in a food processor they blend quick and easy. Thanks for sharing this one I have made it at least 20 times.

You were right--no leftovers!  I'm not the greatest cook and so I followed the recipe as much as I could--FABULOUS! My husband said to keep the recipe and my picky 5 year old loved it!  I didn't have any dry bread crumbs so I just made my own and I didn't toast them or anything...  also didn't have freshly grated Parm so I used the grated Kraft kind.  Thanks for helping me look like a cook for my family!

This was okay. It still came out soggy even after putting extra bread crumbs on the bottom and broiling it for 5 minutes at the end. Maybe I didn't broil long enough? It was better when I dipped it in some leftover garlic spaghetti sauce. I may or may not make this again.

Wow! This was awesome. The only suggestion I would have is to maybe start off at 375 degrees just to get the crust a little crisper. You can also turn it up at the end or turn the broiler on for a minute. My husband said it was the best chicken he ever had!! Thanks!

Since I'm often cooking for one or two people it is difficult to find recipes that can be taken down to scale.  This chicken is a great way to use a couple of extra chicken breasts when I need dinner for just myself.  This, pasta or ricearoni, and a small salad makes a really easy well rounded meal that I can throw together bc I have most everything in my pantry already.

This was great!!  I made it for company and got rave reviews!!  Even my husband, who doesn't really like chicken said he loved it and even requested that I make it again!!  The only thing I changed was to put the cheese on top in the last few minutes of baking rather than in the breadcrumbs as the recipe called for.  Will become a staple in this house!!

This was a very good and quick dinner.  My husband made it in the morning and put it in the fridge,then I popped it in the oven at dinnertime.  We had it with green beans, yellow rice and roasted asparagus. It was delicious and the best part was that all of my kids ate it and asked to have it again.

WOW!!  What a great mix of flavors.  Just right, not too cheesy, not too garlicky!  I did not need to change anything.  My family gobbled this right up and we can't wait to have it again!!  Thanks!

I was pretty happy with this recipe.  The chicken was moist, and the cheddar gave it a nice flavor.  It's not culinary genius or anything, but it was a tasty dinner.

This was soooo good. I didn't have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder. I also ran a little low on the breadcrumb mixture and had to make more. But this stuff tasted great, I wouldn't mind having it at a restaurant. My roommates agree. This is my favorite chicken recipe so far.

This was a great dinner. I cut the recipe in half for 4 chicken breasts, but ran a little short on the bread crumb mixture FYI. The chicken was very moist and the flavor was excelent. It was very easy to make as well. The second time I tried it I put a little red pepper in it for spice, also very tasty.

This one's a keeper! I accidentally burnt the garlic when sauteeing it, so I just dipped the chicken in melted butter and added garlic powder to the breadcrumb mix. To make coating the chicken easy, mix all the breadcrumb ingredients in a ziplock bag, toss in the chicken, zip, and shake. Easy!

This one isn't for me but my partner liked it.  The chicken was moist but I thought the flavor was bland.  I much prefer Garlic Chicken and Amy's Garlic Egg Chicken which is on this site.  It doesn't have cheddar cheese in the ingredients but you could add it.

This chicken turns out really well.  My only concern is the amount of butter.  It was so tender though that I think next time I will try cutting the amount of butter in half to try and cut some of the fat.  Everybody absolutely loved the flavor.

This is the best recipe I've made in along time. We eat in shifts because of work schedules.  My son eats at 3:00 & my husband at 6:00.  I had to take this dish away from my son to have any chicken for my husband. I want to thank Baylor66 for this one, it's GREAT!!!

I started making this prior to realizing I was our of garlic (cloves and jar) so I used garlic powder instead. It was wonderful! Everyone was pleased; cheese lovers and garlic lovers. Very few ingredients are needed - easy and quick!

This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't put all the butter over before baking, just spooned out the garlic and put on top with the cheese out of the breadcrumbs.  Will make again.

Wow, this tasted great AND was easy to make.  Major compliments with this one.  I only had 3 pieces of chicken, not 8, so I cut the recipe in half and it worked very well.  Forgot to pound the chicken, but it came out fork-tender and juicy.

This was pretty good - I think there was too much butter - it was swimming in it. But the flavor was good and it was tender. I had made my own croutons previously and I used those for my bread crumbs. I'll probably make it again but cut way down on the butter.

Very good. Chicken was nice and moist and had tons of flavour. I used the Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I left out the parley and oregano. Nice change of pace for cooking chicken. I also sprayed the top of the chicken pieces  and bottom of pan with Pam so that they came out very crispy and didn't stick.

This was the best chicken breast recipe we have tried in awhile.  IT was so tasty and the chicken was juicy.  The whole family loved it, even my picky five-year old daughter who won't eat anything!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  My husband and teenage daughter wanted to give it 4.5 stars but I told them that wasn't an option. :-)  The common ingredients called for and the fact that I had all of them in the house, made this particularly easy. I used seasoned bread crumbs and low-fat cheddar but otherwise followed as described. I will definitely be making this again.

Five stars from me also.  This was pretty easy to prepare, and baking in the oven is always makes for a "cleaner" kitchen, I think.  The taste was really superb, and I will make this the next time my kids come to visit...

This is an excellent recipe for chicken. I made it for dinner and invited the in-laws. It was a great hit and I will be making it again. The chicken was moist and baking time was perfect.
Thanks for the yummy recipe.

My husband thought they were very good.  I thought it was to much cheddar cheese.  I peeled off the breading and the flavor was excellent.  One stick of butter wouldn't do 8 breasts.  I cut up 3 large ones and pounded them thin and there might have been a Tablespoon left.  They baked in 30 min.  The food processor saved a lot of time.  I think it took longer than 15 min. to put together.  After I grated the cheese I put the breadcrumbs back in the processor with the cheese and processed it more to combine all ingredients.  I will fix this again and use less cheese.

Very good, I added more pepper, but beyond that, just followed the recipe - total hit with the family.  Both my wife and I are good cooks, we take turns, we agreed this one will go into the rotation.

my partner loved this! he was raving about it. such a tasty easy dish. I used different seasonings in with the breadcrumb mix, sage, salt pepper and rosemary. I also followed the advise of a review below and scattered some of the breadcrumb mix onto the tray. when I melted the butter I added a chilli in with the garlic. Thanks!

I give this five stars simply because my dad really loved it and told me to make sure I made it again!  Nice blend of spices/flavors.  I made the recipe as-is:  no substitutions, omissions, or additions.

One of my family's favorite dishes.  Easy and so good.  The only changes I made were dipping the chicken in flour before the butter and using pano breeding.  Great as written, though.

Top kid favorite! I use Italian bread crumbs so I don’t have to add all the seasonings! And make sure to salt the chicken! So good. My kids and hubby love it! Make it like 2-3 times a month!

This was absolutely delicious! I made this for my husband and I for dinner and we both loved how it turned out. The chicken was very tender (able to cut with a fork when eating, didn’t need a knife). I did marinate my chicken in some fajita tenderizer that I had on hand to make it even more juicy and flavorful. I had about 2 cups of the bread crumb mixture left over that I saved in a ziploc for other chicken dinner recipes.

Very good and very tasty. The chicken was a little soggy on bottom and I would like a crisper/thinker coating so definitely will play around with the recipe next time I make it.

Delicious! I made some changes based on other reviews: I floured then buttered; spread bread crumb mixture in the bottom of the dish; I had large cheese shreds so I topped the chicken off just before baking. The chicken was very tender and had that wonderful cheesy crunch - will definitely make this again!

Definitely a staple now.  Except I use a lot more minced garlic than it calls for.  And I cut the chicken up into nugget sized pieces before coating. Because of that I lay them in a smaller 4x8ish glass pan.

I have made this recipe many times, and it always comes out moist and tender.  The only substitution I've made is using a mixed cheese blend like shredded Mexican Cheese instead of cheddar.  Great recipe!  My son, who likes to cook with me, has also added it to his recipe book.

It really was a hit, especially with my picky kids. One child is gluten free so I substituted gluten free Panko, and it really was great. It's like having fried chicken without the mess or grease. Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved it! To lower the carbs I substituted pork rind crumbs for the bread crumbs.  Also doubled the oregano. As suggested,  finished browning  with the broiler.  Will definitely try this with many variations in the future.

I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs but otherwise followed the instructions exactly. It turned out great and I will definitely keep this recipe in my rotation. I cooked on parchment and had no problems with sogginess or sticking, probably because the panko tends to stay crisper than standard bread crumbs. I think this would also be good with mozzarella instead of cheddar as a base for chicken parmesan. Thanks!

The cheese did not come out well on the chicken. The flavor was okay. I made it twice because I thought I messed up the recipe. Not sure if I would make it again.

The chicken was tender, very flavourful and my whole family loved it. My wife suggested we double the recipe as we did want leftovers, we still only had 3 pieces leftover and we used them in our meal the next day. 
Wonderful recipe

Wow !  this is amazing!
And to make it even lower on carbs we made our own breadcrumbs using a mix of cocunt flower, almond flour, and golden flaxseed.  Was tremendous

This recipe is quick and delicious . It is a perfect weekday meal for a busy family. I used chicken tenders, which my kids prefer. I will definitely make it again.

This is one of my favorite dishes. It was sooooo delicious! Not only delicious but easy-to-follow recipe. Loved the clip, I am more of visual kind of person then reading. But I followed the exact measurements and steps and it came out scrumptious! Definitely recommend this recipe.

Made this exactly as the recipe suggested and it was so good! My kids all loved it too. We will be having this regularly. My only suggestion would be to add the remaining breadcrumb mix to the top but not the leftover butter. It was a bit greasy on the bottom due to the butter from the chicken and the cheeses. Had I not used the leftover butter, I'm sure it would have been perfect. 

It got a parmesan crust on the edges of the pan that you will want to scrape off and eat. Don't waste that deliciousness!!

Yummy dish! Cooked at 400 instead to cook them a little bit faster & watched for temp. Breading mixture is plenty! I had enough for 4 massive chicken breasts.

Good flavor.  I made mine too greasy from dipping too long in the butter and over coating with the dry ingredients.  Be sure that you don't do that and it should turn out great.

I added extra cream of mushroom soup, and used breadcrumbs instead of chips and omitted mushrooms (I'm not a big fan). I love onions, so I added extra and sauteed them first. Next time, I think I'll add cream cheese instead of extra cream of mushrooms. I enjoyed it overall!

Family thought this was good but I was disappointed. I bought a new pan with oven-safe baking rack to keep chicken off bottom of the pan. I was disappointed that the chicken didn’t get crispy at all. In fact, the breading was greasy and slid off the chicken after baking was complete. I think too much butter was the problem. I won’t make this recipe again.

I used breast tenders and mixed some cornflake crumbs with the breadcrumbs.  It's very similar to an Italian chicken recipe I have that is better.  I wouldn't make it again because they're so similar.

Made this chicken with only minor changes - used Panko instead of bread crumbs; grated pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan (had it on hand).  Followed reviewers' suggestions to dip chicken in flour before the butter; put thin layer of crumbs at bottom of  dish; minced ingredients in blender.  The chicken browned beautifully (no need to put under broiler).  Here's where I had a brain drain.  Checked temp of chicken at 30 minutes before removing. 
 It was only 85 degrees!!!  Completely panicked.  A reviewer had advised to turn the chicken over at 20 minutes.  I thought maybe that was the problem.  Flipped chicken - what a mess!!!  Do NOT flip - there's absolutely no need  and it ruins the breading.  Put the chicken back in the oven - then it occurred to me to make sure that the thermometer was set on Fahrenheit (which it normally is).  Sure enough it was on Centigrade (have no idea how that happened).  Re-checked temperature and it was done!!!! Oh well....  The flavor was good, but very mild.  I will definitely make this again but may add some crushed red pepper.  Very nice and easy recipe.  Thanks for posting.

I have made this twice. Followed the instructions exactly. The cooking time is completely wrong. I’ve cooked it for an hour and it’s still raw inside. Had to cook for an hour and a half at least, which burns the bread crumbs and cheese. My oven is working fine. If I’d known I’d have to cook it this long I wouldn’t have bothered.

I have made this two times now. The first time I had chicken thighs instead of breasts and it was incredibly moist. I followed the rest of the directions to a T it came out great. Very flavorful and pretty easy. The second time I used chicken breasts like the recipe calls for and it wasn't as good. I think in the future I will stick to the chicken thighs, much more flavor and juicier. Definitely a part of our dinner rotation!

Whole family loved it! House smelled heavenly too! Made as directed except I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil and I did put crumbs on the bottom of dish first. Came out very crunchy. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe turned out SO delicious! I used the thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts and Italian bread crumbs instead. Added in a little more Parmesan cheese as needed. Absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again!

I cut the chicken in quarters lengthwise to make them thinner. I doubled the garlic and butter. I used a foil lined cookie sheet, turned it to 375 as the chicken was cold and made it as written.... this is a new family favorite!!!!!

i used the chicken breasts as is, not pounded out thin.  Delicious!  and as always i recommend using a meat thermometer while they're in the oven.  Then they are cooked to perfection!

Sometimes I omit the parmesan (if I don't have it), and you can't even tell. Also, if you don't want to pound the chicken,  just slice lengthwise into 2 halves. Delicious chicken, everyone who tries it wants the recipe!

Have made this several times now, make sure you use grated parm - like the stuff in the green jar- or it won’t stick very well. First time I made it I followed the recipe, but used the wrong parm. It was a bit of a soggy mess but tasted ok. I’ve started using Panko and it comes out crispier. I also just use chicken tenderloins now, perfect size for these. Also, don’t pour the extra garlic butter over the chicken, that was how I ended up with a soggy mess.

I prepared this by the recipe using 4 lg breasts, pounded slightly flat and baked whole then cut in half to serve.  After 15 minutes at *350, I kicked it up to 375* and baked for another 25ish minutes. JUICY, TENDER, AND FULL OF FLAVOR.  My 3 kids ( 18, 20 and 52) praised my efforts!  My eldest asked 3 times where this recipe was from and thank you, again, Allrecipes!! Sorry, no pic, but it looked as good as it tasted.

Really solid recipe for kids. I pounded chicken then cut in half before breading. I liked the size of the pieces better. I also sprinkles cheddar on top since it didn't seem to stick well with crumbs. UPDATE: sooo good as chicken tenders! Cook last 450 for 15 min. I also tried carb-free with no breadcrumbs and still great

Sliced the garlic cloves up super thin instead of mincing but I will 100% be making this many many times in the future.

Found this recipe to be ok.  Enjoyed it, however reminded me of a packet meal I used to make for my kids years ago that used to be available with cheese etc.  I did not add or take away anything.  Will try again because the chicken was moist.

YUUUUUUUUM!!!!!!!!!
If I could give this ten stars, I would!!! So easy, so delicious, so perfect! I have a picky boyfriend that doesn't like much of anything and he LOVED this!! I made a few changes....
1. I sprinkled some breading on the pan before laying the chicken on it.
2. I flipped the chicken half way through to make sure it was browned on both sides. And
3. I didn't poor the extra garlic butter on top of the chicken, it would have been too much garlic.
Make this, you'll LOVE it!!

My family loves this recipe and we have it at least twice a month.  The only modifications I made was to use 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs and 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs and minced a few more cloves of garlic as we are garlic lovers!

Bon Appetit  !!

Made recipe as directed except I added about 1/4 cup French fried onions (ground in the food processor) to the bread crumb mixture to help bump the flavor up a bit!

I have made this several times now. I add a bit of extra salt and extra toppings because i feel it needs more for underbeath the chicken. I also beat my chicken with a meat tenderizer. It's a family favorite and saved on my phone for easy access. Love it.

This was so amazing. My husband loved it and he's super picky about baked chicken. I had to cut the recipe in half since only cooking for 2. And I used minced garlic from the fridge, just added to the butter towards the end of melting so it didn't burn. It was so yummy

I quartered the recipe almost exactly as written and it was perfect. I used panko bread crumbs and added a layer on the bottom of the dish, it worked beautifully. I baked at 400' for about 25 minutes (I had au gratin potatoes in the oven already) and they were great. Roommate immediately asked how it was made because it was his favorite so far (we eat a lot of chicken). Loved it so much I may make it again tomorrow!

Very tasty way to eat chicken breasts.  Breaks away from the blandness when you’ve been trying to eat better, and just can’t face that fourth chicken breast in a week.

Super easy.  Very tasty.  Chicken was very moist.  I made only minor changes.  Melted less butter than stated and used roasted garlic rather than regular, in a small shallow fry pan.  My chicken breasts were very large so I cut them in half before pounding.  I dipped them into the pan with melted butter rather than pouring that into a shallow bowl. Used panko as I was out of bread crumbs. Reducing the amount of butter resulted in not having soggy breading and the chicken did not stick to my pyrex plate.  Thank you for the video that showed using tongs to handle the chicken breasts.  I've done the one handed dips and breading before but this is so much less messy!

Turned out good except I prepared it an hour before I put it in the oven.  The breading turned out soggy but the flavor was fantastic and everyone wants me to make it again.   Next Time it will be directly to the oven from the breeding dip.

This was a good recipe that was husband approved! If you are looking to lighten the carbs or make this indulgent meal a little kinder to your blood sugar, substitute the bread crumbs for almond flour like I did. It created a beautiful, nutty flavor and kept the breading-like texture, but doesn't have all of the extra carbs that come alone with breadcrumbs.

My chicken breasts were not thoroughly thawed out so I ended up with a little excess liquid but I think all in all it turned out great! It's delicious and was easy to prepare, the shopping list is super helpful too, especially for an inexperienced chef like myself ;)

My BF and kids loved this! I did use some of the other reviewers tips such as broiling for the last 5-10 minutes, depending on how many you make. I personally have to feed 6 people, 4 of which are teenagers. They all loved it!
Thanks for sharing.

I've made this multiple times, and I could never figure out how to get both sides of the chicken to come out crispy, since my wife is rather picky about texture. If any of you have the same trouble, go with this solution that I came up with tonight. Bake in the oven at the directed temp for 25 minutes. Then flip the pieces over, you may need to coat the other side of each piece, and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Worked like a charm. And my wife liked it!

My family LOVED it!!! I did use some panko in addition to the bread crumbs and I didn't have fresh parmesan just the jar kind.
The flavor and the texture are excellent and so juicy!!! I will be making this on a regular basis. I did use Schwan's Chicken Breasts for my chicken.

Good. Made according to the recipe. I did follow the reviews and broiled on low for a couple of minutes at the end of cooking time. I would add more cheese to the top just because I love cheese. Served with potatoes.

Really enjoyed this one! It was easy to prepare and tastes wonderful. We used three large chicken thighs (seriously, what chicken has thighs this big!) and we had to double the coating mix so we had enough. We wanted it to be a thick layer since we like the crispy part. Will definitely make this again, thanks for the great recipe :)

oh wow! i never knew that chicken breasts could be so tender. I added about 6-7 cloves of minced garlic, alot more than recommended, but my family loves garlic so it was good! didnt have shredded parmesan so i used the powdered version (that you usually sprinkle on top of pastas) instead. still turned out amazing! 
NOTE: remember to COAT the bottom of the pan with the remainder of the breadcrumb/cheese mixture so that the bottom of the chicken gets flavour too. brush the pan with olive oil first before doing this, if not the cheese mixture will burn and stick onto the baking pan.

Been using this recipe for over a year now. It's a family favorite. I've made it for my family, friends, in laws, everyone... Always gets compliments and never has left overs. Great with ranch on the side for people who like dips.

I've made this four times, each time a little different. The version I liked best, I had 1.5 times the amount of bread crumbs, half the amount of Parmesan, and 1.5 times the amount of Cheddar.  This made it much crispier and crunchy on top.  I also doubled the amount of parsley and oregano and didn't put any salt in. I also mini-marinated the chicken in the garlic butter, submerging one piece in the garlic-butter mixture (off the burner)  for about 4-5 minutes before rolling it in the crumbs.  Like some other reviews, I put a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan, then the chicken, then extra garlic butter, and then more crumbs. This made the chicken much more tender and the coating more crunchy.  Enjoy!!!

Making this as we speak. Giving an average rating for two reasons- I didn't make it as written, but there are definitely flaws in the written recipe/method. As far as ingredient modifications I added fresh basil and parsley to the bread crumb mix and used all Parmesan (fresh) since I'm going for a chicken parm sorta deal. I had thrown all my chicken breasts into Italian dressing yesterday before deciding what to do with them so they ended up being marinated. Heres why I'm writing a review-- if you don't put your chicken onto a rack to bake as stated in some reviews it will have a soggy coating. Some are fine with this, I am not. I tried baking it as instructed but checked on it half way through to check on it. The top was okay but not crisp yet and the bottom was very soggy and sitting in a pool of oil. This is how I fixed it- broiled for three minutes to make sure top side was crisped, removed breasts from the pan drained the excess oil laid down a layer of bread crumbs and placed the breasts back in crispy side down, sprinkle just a little fresh crumbs on top and back in the oven for second half. Will broil this side as well at the end. Just wanted to share in case anyone else goes with the recipe as written and needs a quick fix.

It was good, but it does require tweaking. Cut breasts into thirds. Don't pound the chicken. Cook it for 50 minutes. I also added more cheddar to the top of the meal, after 30 min. While it was tasty, I found it to be a little bland. You can easily  sprinkle the chicken with your favorite spice, like chili powder or lemon pepper, after the butter treatment, and before you coat it with other ingredients. Make it to your specs for a great meal. I sprinkled it with a little lemon pepper, after cooking, and that gave it more flavor.

This is a great recipe! Again folks make it at least once as printed or you've not actually cooked the above recipe lmao. Next time I'd add a little more garlic less cheese and possibly some ranch mix.

I think i was expecting something a little cheesier. My 8 year old like it (for last night anyway). I didn't use the rice crispies  because it was the only thing I didnt have and I figured with the bread crumbs they weren't needed. I also seasoned chicken before doing the flour and the bread crumbs and I always use Old Bay on Chicken. Overall, it was okay. Not much different than using shake and bake.

I used chicken tenders and didn't feel the need to pound them.  I liked the way the Panko bread crumbs were crunchy and the garlic permeated the chicken.  This would make a nice company dinner as it is a very tasty and rather easy way to prepare chicken, but certainly not a Weight Watchers' way.

Excellent!! Dish I tweaked the recipe  a little, instead of pounding the breasts, I cut the 2 whole breasts into 4, I then forked the chicken and added my own blend of seasoning, rubbing it into the chicken before dipping into the melted butter garlic mixture I added onions to the butter garlic as well, instead of cheddar I used a Mexican blend, Asiago, Asero, Cheddar and parmesan and it came out to die for, I believe you lose tenderness and juices pounding it , my opinion of course

Delicious!! Not too much garlic but just enough and just enough cheese. Did bake it for 40 minutes but made it on chicken filets. I did not pound thin. Very juicy!!

Huge hit with the entire family (which is a minor miracle)!  I made as directed although I was very generous with the cheese and added a little romano cheese as well.

Very Good.  Super moist.  Super flavorful.  My kids might have liked it better with a little less garlic.  I would use half the garlic next time for the kids sake.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! By far the - moistest - (is that a word?!) chicken I have ever made! I make it exactly as the recipe says, with only one tiny change being I use Italian seasoning in place of the oregano. Same amount, I just always have it on hand and never have just plain oregano! I have had so many people ask me for the recipe! It is easy, just a few steps, but well worth the finished product! I would give 10 stars if I could! This is something we make at least twice a month in my house!

Very good! And easy to make, even for me. I took some suggestions: panko for breadcrumbs, thin layer of breading on pan beneath chicken, cheddar cheese on top, and broiled on high for 2 mins after baking. Next time I'm going to make a lot more of the breading mix so I can better layer the pan. Another time I'll try to play with how/when to add the cheddar cheese as I feel having it create a crust on top kept the breading from having a crunch. Still a fantastic recipe!

Hubs loves this. I've made this twice a week for the last three weeks. I use Italian seasoned panko & add 1 tbsp garlic powder. I use  5 garlic cloves. Bake on a rack. Absolutely delicious.

This was easy, and simply delicious. I substituted corn flake crumbs in place of the bread crumbs, and I added some Cayenne pepper to the seasoning. My husband loved it even more than I did.

Very good! Thanks for the quick and tasty recipe! I modified a little based on other reviews-- used a bit less butter (1/4 cup) and had plenty for 5 breasts. I also salt and peppered the chicken before dipping in butter and omitted from bread crumb mixture. Finally, I broiled as suggested by others which created a wonderful texture. My 4 year olds ate every bite!

We loved this - I did use crushed saltines and cheese-its along with the Panko bread crumbs.  It was on the dry side so next time we will cover half way thru and maybe pour a little more melted butter over it before it goes in the oven.

This was really good. The flavor was excellent. Everyone loved it! The garlic butter added a lot of flavor, and the bread crumb mixture the good crispy texture. Probably the best baked chicken breast recipe that I have ever tried!

I'm not much of a cook but when I made I thought it was pretty good and so did the rest of the family. I used panko breadcrumbs and put a layer under the chicken as suggested in other reviews. Other than that I made it just as the recipe says. Baylor66 thanks for a good recipe

This was really good! 
I made adjustments per what others did too. I used chicken tenders since that's all I buy, I put Italian bread crumbs on the bottom of my pan and then in my mixture I used Italian seasoning since that's what I had. I also broiled them at the end and what a difference!!! I'll be making this again.

SO GOOD! My husband really enjoyed it and he is used to his mothers (unbelievably good) food.. My 5 year old also liked it and asked for seconds, which never happens!! The only thing I did differently was I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain... Two thumbs up!!

This was very tasty. I was out of Parm so I just salt and peppered and upped the garlic and added a little extra shredded cheese. Will make again and use the Parm...although I have made many chicken recipes and breaded with Parm and I know it's good. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out really good.  The only change I made to the recipe is, I only had a 3 cheese cheddar mix  and I used shredded parmesan (since I had some) instead of grated.  Worked out fine!  My son who is a very picky eater even liked it.

very tasty, versatile dish  the whole family will love. I swapped swapped out the bread crumbs for sun chips (harvest cheddar) and it works great!! throw in some buttery mashed potatoes and you have a simple, cheap meal that tastes like a hundred bucks!

I thought it was really good, an easy quick chicken recipe. I boiled the chicken first because it was frozen, and the meat fell right off the bones. It was perfect! I used a bag of club crackers in replace of bread crumbs and it was phenomenal. I also added red chili flakes to the herbal mixture for an added zing, I used just regular pizza parmasean because that's all I had and it all came out amazing. Cook time was about 15mins. Or less because it was more about melting the ingredients and bringing the flavors together. Pulled it out, drizzled a little bit more butter over the top, put foil over the top of the tray to rehydrate with steam for about 2 mintues, and devoured it. Definitely will make this again.

I don't usually alter a recipe until I've tried it as written, but I've learned to read the reviews and listen to the ones that are repeated over and over or at least sound right. So I altered this one and it came out very good. The kids and my grandmother loved it. My grandmother said it was the best chicken she's ever eaten. The wife and I thought it was pretty good. Here's what I did:

Definitely flatten the chicken. It makes it very tender. I used crushed Ritz crackers for the crumbs because that's what I had on hand. I used Sargentos 4 State Cheddar because it's awesome. The cheese was coarsely shredded, so I put the entire breeding mixture in the food processor to make it stick to the chicken better. I coated the chicken pieces in flour before dredging them in the butter. I also lined the bottom of the baking dish with fine cracker crumbs. Finally, I broiled the chicken for two minutes at the end. 

I don't understand why some say the dish has no flavor because there is plenty of flavor in there. It's cheesy and goes well with a side of broccoli.

So easy and delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except I just put the shredded cheese over top as I couldn't really get it to stick to the chicken like the seasonings and bread crumbs did.  Will definitely make again!

LOVE it -- so tender, so tasty!!  My kids will actually ask  for this when they think of it -- big accomplishment for picky eaters!  One thing discovered -- I tried to make using frozen breast tenders, and the butter/garlic dip & then coating would not "stick" --- have to always use thawed breasts to keep preparation easy.  But it was still delicious!

Made this for dinner ! Used exact recipe but used chicken thigh instead of breast and flattened out. Didn't have cheddar so I used 3 cheese mixture (Gouda, Parmesan and colby). Used about 2 cups of it. Took exactly 30 minutes and let stand for few minutes.

A deli I used to eat at for lunch would make this and it was like Christmas when my favorite worker gave me this recipe. It is so tasty. 

I will admit that I cheat and melt my butter in the microwave with the garlic mixed in it. Its faster and the flavor disperses the same for us. I also will purchase italian breadcrumbs that already have the spices mixed into them.

Turned out amazing! I used chicken thighs instead of breast since that was what I had on hand. Also, not a fan of cheddar so I used the mexican blend of cheese (again, what was at hand). Positively delicious! Had one piece but really struggling to not go for two more! YUM!

Suggestion: Definitely try out what you like. I love garlic flavors so I added more garlic. I love the Italian style breadcrumbs so I used those. Also LOVE the flavors of oregano and parsley so I pretty much doubled on that. I leave out the salt since I think I've got that covered with all the other ingredients. I need my food bursting with flavor! Next time I might add a bit of cayenne pepper just to see the outcome!

Absolutely delicious!!  I cut the chicken breast into 1/2:" steaks.  Also added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the butter/garlic mix.  I will definitely do this one again and share with friends.

I make extra breadcrumb mixture and sprinkled the leftover on top of the chicken before baking! It tastes like chicken mixed with cheese straws! I was blown away.

Absolutely AMAZING!! The only change I made was to invert the bread crumbs and cheese.  Otherwise exactly as listed.  The aroma while it was cooking had everyone's stomach grumbling in anticipation!!  The flavor was absolutely Superb!! This is a great choice that will now be a staple in our home!! ????

Was looking for something new, but was tight on time. We had everything we needed for this recipe so I dove right in. It was very easy and even better tasting. Recommend to give it a try!! No picture... Cause it's gone already!

Usually I read through all the reviews so that I can make a recipe with suggested changes. Tonight I was in a hurry and just made it exactly as the recipe stated. This was amazing. So very quick and easy and everyone in my family loved it. (Even the one who normally doesn't like chicken very much. This will be a staple in our house for now on!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this a number of times. The first time I followed the directions exactly. Not pretty, or good.  Every time I have altered something...
This time-I used chicken breast tenders, used flour before the wet dip. Also added a little flour to the dry mix. Used half panko/half bread crumbs. This time it turned out much better! Before it had always been soggy & greasy.

Absolutely delicious!  I had to cook to the chicken for a little longer because it was still frozen. My family loved it!  The recipe was flavorful,  chicken was moist. I only made 3 large chicken breasts and I didn't tenderize it. Still came out great.

My family LOVED this! I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese or garlic, so I used the prepackaged Parmesan and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. Definitely making it again.

I took the advice of others who'd made this recipe and blended the bread crumb mixture in a small food processor - it definitely helped with coating more evenly. I also used a baking sheet and small rack over it... instead of a baking dish. (I just didn't want the chicken sitting in all that butter). So good! Kids and adults loved it, whether fresh out the oven or cut up in a salad the next day. Two thumbs up.

Almost everyone here loved it.  My 16 yr old said the flavour was  great and he liked it but the bottom part was a bit slimy.  My 13 yr old had seconds and wanted 3rd's ~ He also said his brother was crazy ~ the chicken was super good.  This recipe was so simple and I loved it too!

This was great, just as written. Really moist and good flavor.  I didn't cook the butter and garlic much more than a couple of minutes.
 Will make it again!

I did not review the recipe thoroughly and since it's for 8 breasts it was way too much. 

Were I to make it again, I wouldn't mix the cheese with the dry ingredients, and just sprinkle the tops (heavily). The breading was a bit much, and not very savory.

Yes I  added another can of soup and then about one third of a cup of sour cream and about a tablespoon of parsley flakes. Tasted great but I  think  next time I'll cut the water in half or eliminate it. I also put the chicken breast in whole but cut in half lengthwise.

I make this all the time. The family loves it. I mix it up a bit depending on what I have on hand. I don't bother pounding, I use half olive oil and I increase the herbs if using plain panko or breadcrumbs. I sprinkle some breadcrumbs on the bottom of the pan as others suggested. It's also good sliced the next day thrown in a salad. If there's leftovers.

I've made this chicken several times and it always comes out super tender and tasty. Very easy to make and reheats well. I personally leave out the oregano because I find it to overpower recipes. Enjoy!

I simply microwaved the butter with freshly minced garlic. It worked just as good, instead of boiling on the stove. I only had to refresh it in the microwave once when the butter started to harden. But it came out great!! Such a tasty recipe...crispy and great flavors!

Oh man! This dish is a staple at my house. Even when I have guests I make it. Everyone always asks me for the recipe. I added a lot more garlic than what the recipe calls for. I also do a half mixture of butter and olive oil. I usually add a bit of paprika too. Love this recipe!

Yummo!  Very tasty!  Chicken turned out nice and juicy, too.  I would suggest using the finely shredded cheese - might stick easier when coating chicken.

Good chicken! I make this when I need to put something together quickly by using garlic powder (about a teaspoon) instead of fresh garlic, and seasoned bread crumbs. I use Smart Balance spread instead of the butter, and omit the salt in the coating mix. I also leave out the Cheddar cheese and sprinkle it on top of my coated chicken instead. I can cut down on the cheese this way, and using reduced fat cheese cut down more fat and calories.  Makes a good dinner with a green salad and whole wheat rolls.

This dish has become a great go to recipe. I do make a few changes. First I use about half of the amount of bread crumbs and I do not always use bread crumbs.  Sometime it is matzo meal, ground almonds, soy flour, what ever I have around. I also use different types of cheeses in combination with cheddar. Always good and so easy to make.

This was excellent -- quite tasty.  I followed the instructions pretty closely, with the exception that I went light on the cheese and subbed mozzarella for some of the cheddar.  Also, I was a bit heavy-handed with the garlic (no stars take away for that). 

A couple thoughts:  
* I strongly agree with the suggestion to go with Panko bread crumbs as well.  They were crispy in a way that's hard to attain with regular bread crumbs -- especially those from a package. 
* I'd like to try this with less butter next time. It was delicious, but I think I'll give it a shot with olive oil and a little butter, just to make it a bit healthier.

Amazingly simple and delicious recipe! We ratcheted up the flavor by replacing the bread crumbs/oregano/parsley with the Savory Herb flavor of Stovetop. Also, be warned that pouring all the butter on top of the chicken, depending on your tastes, may be too much. The first time we made this we poured all the butter on and it was simply too rich; I could feel my arteries clogging as I chowed down! Pouring out about half of the remaining butter seems to strike a good balance between moisture, flavor, and keeping it from being too "rich"

So good! The chicken came out perfect.  Juicy and fully cooked, which is never my luck.  
I used homemade breadcrumbs bc I ran out of the store bought,  but I actually liked that!  
I had the chicken already seasoned and in the fridge before I decided to make this.  
Next time I'll add crushed pretzels to the crumbs for extra crunch!!!
But this was fantastic, so glad I made enough to have it for lunch too (let's hope it reheats well)

This is a perfect recipe. I am obsessed with it. But I did make a few changes to my recipe. I didnt add the parmesan because the cheddar to me was more than enough. I just used italian seasoning because it has all the herbs wrapped into one, and I didnt put salt because the cheddar and butter are already salted. And when it was almost done cooking (maybe 5 more minutes needed) I tasted it and for some reason my taste buds told me it needed lemon. So I said to myself, if I squeeze lemon, the breading is going to get all clumpy and weird, so I sprinkled some organic lemon pepper and OMG it gave it such a wonderful kick.  Other than that, I followd the recipe and honestly, I want to make more but I ran out of italian bread crumbs. My toddlers,  My son who is almost 3 and my daughter wo is a month shy of being 2 are pretty picky, My daughter who wants nothing to do with meat or chicken, devoured it and I steamed some brocolli along to mix in to kill two birds with one stone, and my son, who is the pickiest eater ever, devored this as well and I would sneak in a florlet of brocolli or two and he wouldnt notice. He kept telling me, "more chicken, more taste". LOL. I am a stay at home mom and literally besides picking up after them, I spend my day in the kitchen trying to make things that will satisfy their little tummies. This did it for them and me.

I tip my hat to the creator of this recipe! It is my husbands favorite meal. We were out of breadcrumbs the first time I made this so the only ingredient adjustment I ever did (and still do) was to use matzo meal instead of breadcrumbs. It came out wonderful and so flavorful! I also usually make a cooking preparation adjustment due to disliking having the stove top on since I have a very grabby eight month old son! I melt the butter in the microwave and use a half teaspoon of garlic powder instead of the clove garlic. It's almost the same result as the original recipe, although I don't think powdered spices are ever as good as fresh. Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with great results. My one piece of advise is to not be like me and assume you can just use WHOLE chicken breasts pounded flat before baking them. Doing them in halves allows each one to be that much more flavorful!

Made this twice now, and is the family favorite.  Using thin cutlets is the key.   Chicken is very juicy.   Followed recipe.  Fast, low-cost, and easy to make.

wow...this was incredible...didn't have cheddar so I used shredded mozzarella. My chicken breasts were large so I sliced them instead of pounded...I got 2-3 thick slices per breast. This is definitely a keeper !!!

Made a quick version using precooked frozen chicken fillets, cooked according to package and tasted very yummy.

Substituted garlic powder and onion powder because my picky eaters wouldn't eat it otherwise. Stuck under the broiler a few minutes to melt and brown the top.

Thank you for great dinner idea and helping me get dinner on the table in a flash.

I used crushed saltines instead of bread and I marinated my chicken over 4 hours in Italian dressing thereby omitting the dip in garlic butter part.  This may be why both my husband and I thought this recipe was really amazing and flavorful.  The dressing may have done the trick.

So amazing!! We've been getting kind of sick of chicken and I think the reason was not having a good enough seasoning to change things up a bit. This recipe was really simple. Only thing diff was that I ran out of Parmesan and used mixed shredded cheese instead of straight cheddar. Other than that I did everything else the same. So delicious that even my 18 month old baby who hardly ever eats meat was eating this chicken. Definitely a win.

This is the best lazy recipe for using whatever you have in the fridge. I made use of garlic salt to conserve expensive fresh garlic (only a little to stretch 1 clove per breast) and panko instead of normal bread crumbs, because it gives it that fluffed bread and cheese topping like a good casserole.

Turned out amazing! Was also fun to make with my daughters. I used minced garlic instead, 4 tsp, and added a little basil. Served with herb long grain rice. Everybody LOVES it:) easy to make and inexpensive. Great recipe.

Delicious! The only changes I made were to add a little onion powder and garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture.  Baked it for 40-45 minutes, put under the broiler for 2-3 minutes, and the chicken was moist and flavorful.

Very simple and easy to do. My family loved this chicken. I'm not normally in the kitchen doing the cooking it's my fiance so I shocked the whole family once I made the chicken there was no leftovers. I was excited how it turned out myself.  I think I may be in the kitchen a little bit more often.  I used all the ingredients given nothing different less chicken breast. You also don't need all that butter. I use fresh parsley instead of dry. I didn't mix my cheddar cheese in my bowl until my chicken was done then I top the chicken with the cheese and let it melt a little. Sweets

Finally a crispy, juicy chicken I don't have to beg the kids to eat. Followed the recipe, but didn't put a lot of cheese on top (and didn't miss it). Baked them on a cookie rack over a foil-lined cookie sheet to crisp both sides. Really yummy! Thank you, BAYLOR66!

Delicious recipe. The cheddar cheese was an interesting addition and made a nice crust on the chicken. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used granulated, but I'm sure fresh would be better. Using the melted butter didn't really make the crumbs stick, but it didn't matter, I just sprinkled it on top of the chicken after placing them on a foil lined cookie sheet. A tip: spray the foil! I thought the butter was enough to keep it from sticking, but it should have been sprayed with pam first.

YUM! I added an egg to the butter to help the coating stick (just make sure the butter isn't too hot so the egg doesn't scramble!). I also baked an additional 15 minutes and turned the heat up to 400 for that period to allow the cheese to get a bit brown/crispy. This is a keeper, leftovers are great right out of the fridge! Do make sure to use plenty of non-stick spray and/or nonstick aluminum foil, they will stick quite a bit without!

Not as good as I'd hoped.  To get the outside crispy, you have to cook it longer. The chicken ended up dry.

This was so moist and tasty.  I didn't change any ingredients but did change the method only a little.  My chicken breasts were really huge so I cut them in half horizontally before they were completely thawed (really easy then).  Added a little garlic powder and pepper right onto the chicken before coating with garlic butter/evoo and dry mix.  I used my mini food processor for the dry mix to crumble all finer. I lined a cookie pan with foil and topped with a cooling rack.  Cooked on the rack for 35 minutes turning at the 15 minute mark, then broiled for 2 minutes to crisp the top. Perfect. My husband just kept raving about it.  This is now my favorite baked chicken even though I found it time consuming - I am not a fast prepper.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks

So, after reading some of the reviews I noticed that the most common issue with this recipe is that it was "bland". So for mine I did quite a few changes on it. I flattened out the chicken breasts and then tossed them in a freezer bag with a yummy Italian dressing and plenty of minced garlic. As for the breading I used a combination of Italian bread crumbs and panko. As for the added ingredients, I went with, oregano, pepper, season salt, garlic powder, parsley, and red pepper to really jazz it up. I dipped the breasts in egg yolk and then in the bread crumb mixture covering the bottom of the pan in the remaining crumbs. I broiled them for the last 5 minutes, once they were beginning to turn gold I tossed the cheddar and parmesan on top they came out flavorful and perfect! My husband and my 4 year old loved it!

I made this according to the recipe except I used italian flavored breadcrumbs.  It was a hit.  I was asked to put this on the "keeper" list.  One comment was "This could only be made better by putting crisp bacon in with the breading mix".  I may try that next time, and use less butter in an attempt to lower the calories.  Lin Mattes

I like this recipe, the favor was awesome! What the family really didn't like was the chicken breast were to thick, it made the chicken rubbery. Next time I will pound the chicken breast to flatten them more. I will make this again for sure. Thank for the great recipe. :)

It was really good. I used garlic bread crumbs from the store and it might of made it too salty but still very tasty.

Made this a few nights ago for dinner and it was fabulous! My husband and daughter raved about it, insisting I make it again soon. I used panko bread crumbs and I think this made the extra crunchy texture we love. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T and it was delish!

Very good!  My chicken was a tad dry but maybe because I didn't pound them thin enough?  I'll definitely try it again, the flavor was great!

This is a really amazing baked chicken recipe. Changes were made for crispier chicken. I slightly took down the amount of butter used here because I skipped the additional drizzling before baking step. I suspect it in being the reason why some other reviewers reported a soggy result. Panko crumbs are definitely a must for a crisp chicken.
Plain parmesan cheese worked really well here as well. I slightly increased the salt in the breading mix. The last 2 minutes of cooking, broil until you get a slightly browned surface. Sliced fresh basil pairs with this recipe perfectly. My husband loved this recipe so I will definitely be keeping this one. 5 stars…

This is hubby's favorite dinner!  I don't bother pounding the chicken.  I just take one breast and cut it in half to make it thinner. I double the parsley and oregano. I buy the bagged grated Parmesan cheese and put 1/2 cup in several snack bags to freeze until I am ready to make this recipe again.

Didn't work out too well for me. I have a non stick pan and when cooking the chicken in the butter it got all greasy and the bread crumbs came off. Will possibly try a different recipe similar to this.

Delicious and moist chicken recipe! I paired the chicken with asparagus and quinoa, which made a lovely dinner. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter used (for a healthier dish)

Excellent, flavorful chicken!  I did everything identical to the recipe except the cooking method:  I cooked the chicken in the pan with the melted butter on the stove.  Everything else was the same.  The chicken ended up extremely flavorful--many compliments all around!

I LOVED this recipe. I used some hot sauce with the garlic and butter, giving it a little kick! and italian herbed bread crumbs as well! The crust on this chicken was my favorite part because it was so delicious!

Oh my gosh! This was so good and so easy for busy days! Even my picky 9 yr old loved it. Followed the recipe but have learned from past experience to use just a tad bit more of the spices-instead of 1/8 of a tsp of something, I'll use 1/4 or 1/2 instead. Other than that, everything was followed to the T. Thanks for a great tasting recipe!!

This was pretty good. I took another reviewer's advise and cooked the chicken on a foil-lined cookie sheet instead of a baking dish. The bottom still came out slightly soggy but the top of the chicken still had some loose bread crumbs that didn't soak into the butter, so everything evened out. The breading mixture was delicious and the chicken was very moist.

Easy and great! I skipped the garlic because I didn't have any and just melted the butter in the microwave, I also discarded the extra butter. It turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!

Very good recipe, however, I added crushed potato chips to the bread crumb mix & cut out the salt. My bread crumb mix had oregano & parsley in the mix, so I added 1/4 tsp of basil & 1/4 tsp of thyme which made a really nice combination of flavors. I also used chicken breast tenders and it required less baking time. I served it with fried egg noodles that had a garlic cracker crumb finish and applesauce.

Just fixed this tonight. Make sure you flatten chicken breast. I fixed 6 pieces, so I added 2 sticks of butter to the garlic. Would fix this again a huge hit!!!

Amazing! Completely delicious! Was easy to make! I used garlic bread crumbs and sharp cheddar cheese and only a little bit of heated parmesan. I used a little too much bread crumbs but it was coated perfectly with that amazing cheesy taste! Love this recipe!

Yummy recipe! I went by the recipe except with two variations - I used crushed garlic and cheese croutons instead of bread crumbs and used dry ranch mix instead of the spices. I really caked on the croutons/cheese mix and drizzled the tops with a little olive oil before baking. I served it with white buttered rice seasoned with Johnnys all seasoning. So good!

If I was to use cornmeal instead of breadcrumbs, would there be a huge difference in taste.

This recipe was good, but a little greasy for my taste.  As other reviewers suggested, I added a cracker to give it some crunch.  I used a flipz cracker with pretzel on one side and cracker on the other.  There was way too much of the breading and think if I make again, I would use much less of the regular bread crumbs and less butter.

I loved it. But I definitely should have broiled right at the end. Wonderful dish though. Especially with a side of butter and herb mashed potatoes!

This was amazing. I only substituted Italian bread crumbs and I used a tsp of Italian seasoning in place of the other seasonings. We are making this a lot more often. Yum

Made with panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs, I felt it had a lot of flavor, my daughtered downed the entire thing pretty quickly, but my son who had to heat his up because he came home later said it was just your average chicken. So I'm not sure if I will make again

My 13 year old is a chicken breast fanatic, so I'm always looking for new ways to cook them. This was easy, tasty, and used ingredients that I always have on-hand anyway!  I used a heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of just the oregano, and I only had dried parmesan cheese, but these were my only substitutions.  30 minutes in the oven was the perfect amount of time.  They were flavorful and moist with a crunchy layer on top.  I lined my pan with parchment paper for an easy cleanup.  Will make again.  Thank you.  ;-)

I cooked this recipe just as written. It was good, but I can imagine the different ways I can make it just a bit better. While the chicken was good, it was overshadowed by the yummy sides I made. Next time I will use egg instead of butter to see if that makes a difference. I will say that the chicken came out juicy and tender and my kids wolfed it down. Because of this, my next attempt might include making this into chicken nuggets - what a treat for the kiddos! Thanks.

Excellent flavor enjoyed by all! I used the jar garlic in the butter, added a little onion flakes to the breading and extra cheese on top. Bottom was soggy so I'll try the rack next time but still delicious. There well definitely be a next time. Easy to make

I cut the recipe in half to make dinner for 2 and it was very good. Served it with parmesan garlic noodles. Its a very tasty option for a busy night, and it requires only ingredients I always have on hand, which is a big plus for me. (I hate recipes that require I buy things that are only useful for one or two other recipes). This will definitely make its way into my weeknight meal rotation.

This recipe is the best recipe I have found but I will say I added a few changes.  I tried to make it  a bit lower in sodium then what the recipe calls for.  I used unsalted pretzels and ground them up in place of the bread crumbs.  I also added white cheddar and parmesan cheese (I think the yellow cheddar gets too greasy)  I then added for the green element chives instead of oregano and parsley.  The cheese is salty enough that you dont need to add extra salt.  My husband and everyone we have served this too have fought for the final piece!  There are never left overs this way!

This was great. Husband loved it. He asked for more. Didn't make any changes. Did broil at the end to get the crunchy top. This is going into the rotation.

Turned out wonderful!! I used 3 breasts & cut into about 4 pieces each. I did not have garlic cloves, so just mixed garlic powder with the butter on the stove top. I also crumbled up some cheez-it's in the bowl. Next time I will put a cheese layer on the bottom of the pan, but I poured the extra butter & cheese on top & it turned out delicious. I baked for 17 minutes, broiled for 3 (should have done just 2) and then baked another 3. Delicious & super juicy!!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made this more than half a dozen times and everyone who tries it falls in love with the flavors and tenderness of the chicken.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  The one thing I found was that using shredded cheddar can be a bit difficult and it is best to use fancy shredded cheddar so that the shreds are smaller and stick to the chicken better.

This recipe was just O.K. for me.  Nothing stood out on this dish to make it something I would try again.  I did sub taco cheese for the cheddar because that is what I had on hand.  Probably will not make this recipe again.

Good chicken recipe.  It's not really necessary to the put the cheese mixture on the bottom side of the chicken as it will just get oily/soggy.

I forgot to pound the chicken breasts but it still turned out great. I added a little olive oil to the butter mixture and sauteed the garlic for just a minute or two - five minutes is too much for fresh garlic. Then I just pressed the coating into the chicken, poured the leftover sauteed garlic butter over the chicken, and baked it a tad longer than the recipe - maybe 35-40 minutes as they were plump breasts. My oven runs a little cold so I jacked up the heat to 400 for the last ten minutes or so to brown. Very fast and easy to scale - I made it for just two breasts, but going to try four tonight!

Love this quick & easy recipe.  There are NEVER leftovers and we fight over the cooked bits of cheese in the bottom of the pan. We do this one at least once every two weeks.

If you want a great recipe that everyone will love try this.  I make this about every 1-2 weeks and the family loves it.  I just use Panko crumbs and shredded cheddar of choice and the parmesan cheese. The trick to making it great is when you dredge it in the garlic butter... make sure you get both sides covered well. My only change was cooking time... I went a little higher setting 400-425 for a good 20 mins and maybe a little longer, just monitor cooking time.  If you compare this to the "KRAFT Fresh Take"... this wins hands down.
Very good...   : )

This was outstanding!  The chicken was moist and so tender.   The combination of spices with the cheese and bread crumbs was perfect.   I used garlic that had already been diced (purchased in a jar) and extra cheese.

This was a good recipe...however, I'm certain it would taste even better if we hadn't had to reheat it after we came back home (due to timing issues). 
Next time we're going to cut the butter in half and use light butter as well--it's very buttery!

We all liked this, although I would have liked the breading to be more crispy (not sure if that's possible when you bake a breading vs. deep frying). I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs since that's what I had on hand (about 10). I used the Italian breadcrumbs and a Mexican blend shredded cheese plus some additional spices (you can eyeball the crust mixture). The chicken was really moist (although a little over done at 30 minutes). I think the garlic butter is key in this recipe.

Fantastic! I did need a half stick more butter to finish dipping, but my chicken breasts were good sized. Can't wait to have the rest for lunch tomorrow!

Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was I used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs because I didn't have them on hand.  But turned out fantastic. Very filling though with all that butter. But will definitely make again, maybe a little less butter next time!

I really loved this the first time I made it, however, the 2nd time I made it I used the already chopped canned garlic, and I stilled liked it but I think I will stick with fresh garlic instead. Great recipe,going to make it for my daughter's first birthday party. Hopefully it will be a hit!

The chicken was tender, but I was hoping for more flavor.  I added garlic salt + other spices, and flavor was good, but not great.  Might make again

Mmmm...mmm...mmm!! This chicken turned out to be moist and just delicious. Apart from using fresh parsley instead of dried, i made the recipe as is. I made a large batch and so glad i did as that meant i had leftovers, which tasted just as great. This is a terrific weekday dinner or even an easy meal for entertaining. A keeper!!

It was good, but very one-dimensional.  We were thinking of adding just a little savory spice to give it some added zing.

I think it could have been better. I may have messed with the recipe too much (used crushed wheat chex mix instead of bread crumbs), but I think it has the potential to be wonderful. It smelled really great, though!

I totally loved this! I followed everything in the recipe but did not have bread crumbs so I used crushed seasoned cubed stuffing and used it. Loved the flavor and really liked that it didn't take all day to make. Like another reviewer I threw in the leftover crumb mix in the bottom of the pan and it was a bonus stuffing like side dish! It absorbed all the juices from the chicken and tasted amazing! Two thumbs up!

I followed the recipe to the letter, and the parts of the chicken that the breading STAYED on was delicious. However, most of the breading stayed on the bottom of the pan, so it was plain chicken breast that you tasted.

If I were to make this again, I would definitely add an egg wash to help the breading stick, and then I am sure it would be much better - the chicken was nice and moist, but I want more than just plain chicken.

That said, also line the pan in foil - it was a pain to clean!

It had a great texture and we liked it very much except that it was a tad bland. Will definitely make again and give it some more flavor next time. Did broil the last two minutes for extra crispiness, and had to cook for 55 minutes, not 30.

I made this chicken and have added it to my regular cooking schedule.  the Chicken is always moist and flavorful.  I did turn on the broiler for about 10 mins prior to serving just to make the top crisier.

My husband jokingly said I should sell this chicken in a restaurant and that the house smelled like one of our favorite restaurants when the chicken was cooking. My picky 6 year old liked it so much she stole my husband's piece! I made the recipe as written, with the only change being I added more cheddar cheese on top before cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

A very rich, delicious and classic chicken recipe. The butter and cheese make it so rich, even though it tastes heavenly I could never eat more than one. My advice would be cook what you need for that meal, and no more. I don't believe the bread crumbs would reheat well and this is probably best served as a treat rather than as a regular dish. I cut the servings down to 2, per another reviewer, and the measurements worked perfect. Another reviewer also suggested lightly lining the bottom of the pan with breadcrumbs to keep the chicken from becoming soggy; I thought that worked well also.

I halved the recipe - used 2.3lbs of chicken (4 breasts) and cut each breast in half before pounding.  Excellent!!!!

I love this! It's very filling and delicious. The breadcrumb mixture looks like it does not have enough breadcrumbs, but I added a bit more and it turned out to be way too much. The recipe is perfect.

Delicious! We love this recipe, but it did need extra time in the oven for regular size chicken breasts as others said.

I made this tonight and it was delicious, but I had to make some changes due to some pantry limitations.  I used crushed up French's Onions instead of bread crumbs, a Mexican mixture of cheese, and had to go half and half on the butter with olive oil.  It stayed pretty crispy (on top) with the onion mixture.

Excellent. Very tender, moist & tasty. My only problem was with having to cook the breasts 45 minutes vice the 30 cited in the recipe. The chicken breasts were nothing special in regards to size either, just your standard frozen ones in a bag I got from Costco. This recipe still deserves 5 stars.

This was quite good. I used panko bread crumbs and chicken tenderloins instead of half breast.  They cooked nicely. I did cook them for 35 minutes.  
I might try cooking them on a rack next time, so they won't sit in the oils from the cheese and butter.  
It is a keeper.

This was by far the most tasteless recipe I have eaten in a long time.  The only thing tasty about it was the topping - I have yet to find a decent recipe for boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  It needs an experienced chef to bring this to life.

This chicken is absolutely delicious!  The only reason I give a 4 out of 5 is because of the excessive use of butter, making it not a diet friendly meal.

I absolutely love how tender and juicy the chicken stays, while keeping the crispy, cheesy crust! We don't pound the chicken flat like the recipe calls for, so that might have something to do with it. Having a little extra crust is optimal - having it to sprinkle over the top really makes the meal go crunch!

This is soooo good and easy!  I used Panko breadcrumbs and also added a thin layer of the crumb mixture to the bottom of the pan before placing the chicken in to keep it from getting soggy on the bottom.  It came out great.  I have shared this recipe with my mom and several friends.  They have all raved about it.

This one was good for the entire family.  The bottom was a little gooey for me so I am going to try the breadcrumbs on the bottom next time and I am going to substitute garlic salt for the salt.  We will definitely make this one again.  Thanks.

I like the ease of this recipe, but so much butter is out of the question for health reasons. I used a mixture of egg beaters & spices instead of butter. I used panko crumbs &added onion powder. I also borrowed the idea of another reviewer to put a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom. Also I sprayed the tops with cooking spray to moisten them to help browning. Result was very tasty, chicken was tender & the coating was crunchy & tasty.

My very, very picky boyfriend loved these.  I didn't have cheddar so I used asiago instead, and it was excellent.  I will probably always use asiago.  So good.

For a healthier option I probably won't drizzle the remaining butter over next time.

This was very tasty!  The outside was crispy and the chicken was so moist.  I didn't have enough Parmesan cheese so I used what I had.  Oops, I just noticed that I was supposed to pound the chicken breast.  I didn't and it turned out just fine!

Wowl!!  This is by far, the most tender, juiciest and delicious chicken we've ever cooked!   We have a weekly "dine-around" with friends and we cooked this for our turn.  8 adults (including 1 very picky eater) went gaga over this dish..

Made for my picky eaters (family of 7) and even my 4 yr old said it was the best chicken ever!  I decided not to use the breading and I added / melted cream cheese into the sauce and added mozzarella cheese also for more of a cheesy flavor....It was a HUGE hit :)

My family gave this a 4.5 star rating (5 stars being Pizza, of which nothing tops...yet).  I am not a cook, I only do it as it's a necessary part of life. I try to find the easiest recipes I can that will take the least amount of time, this was both.  On top of it being super easy and quick, it was delicious.  I added a tad more butter and a generous amount of garlic beyond what it called for as I was beginning to run low towards the end, but that's the only "problem" (if that could be counted as a problem) that I ran across.  The chicken cooked perfectly, not tough or undercooked at all.  We agreed that this will appear again at the table and I might even take it to a pot luck (of which I usually only sign up for desserts).  A must try for sure.

5 stars after my tweaks. I used basil, not oregano. Extra garlic (fresh!) Added a few more seasonings to the bread crumbs. Didn't pound out the breasts, just cooked them at 400 for 40 minutes & flipped half way through cooking. A definite keeper. Thanks!

Great with panko bread crumbs for a more crunchy topping. Make a few extra chicken breats, everyone I have cooked this for has gone back for seconds!

This is an easy and yummy way to make chicken breasts a little less boring. I used a little less cheese but used sharp cheddar, paired it with steamed asparagus and yellow rice. Nice easy recipe.

Simple and great! I cut the breasts in half instead of pounding them. Almost any cheese will do to your preference but the recipe was delicious. This is a keeper and will be regular for us. Thanks for sharing!

I was really excited to try this recipe.  All the ingredients were in my pantry.  However, the garlic flavor just didn't come through.  I cook the meat until just done; the cheese burnt on the bottom of the chicken.  I'm going to adjust the recipe for a little more flavor and less cheese - just garlic chicken.

This was easy and delicious. It was simple to pull together for a week night meal!I took a few hints from other reviewers. Using the food processor to combine the ingredients was genius. It made everything uniform size and distributed the flavors evenly over the chicken. It is a good idea to pound the chicken out  because even pounded out.. it really plumps in the oven. As a result it's very juicy! Bread crumbs underneath  did keep it from getting soggy. Used the aluminum pan also. Excellent results!

I thought this was an easy to do weeknight dinner - it will definitely be added to the rotation.  Next time I don't think I'll use as much bread crumb since my chicken breasts were sliced thin to begin with.  The added crumb topping was too much for my liking.

Loved this recipe! The flavors all came together so nicely, it was a perfect blend. I used 50% reduced fat cheese and margarine and it still came out great. Highly recommend, will be making again.

Great recipe!!  The garlic smelled so good.  Maybe good enough to keep the "Twilight" movies away from my home.   Substituted panko to get a better crispy browness.

Great taste and easy to make! I served this over rice and it was a great complement. 
I would say that the chicken really must be pounded thin, I omitted that step and the breasts took and extra ten minuets.

I've made this twice for my boyfriend and he loves it! He thinks I am this awesome cook, which of course I'm not but this dish is so easy that t makes me look like one. I made a couple of changes to the recipe to suit our tastes, I used Cheddar Jack cheese instead of plain Cheddar. I used a four cheese blend instead of plain parmesan.

The dish is quick and easy for a busy family.  I followed the directions as written, except I did not pound the chicken.  I used Market Day chicken breasts which are the perfect thickness and size.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  A winner recipe - thanks for sharing.

This was awesome. Even my live in food critic had 3 helpings. Next time I think i'll experiment a little with the breading. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs but i think i'll try Panko or cheese-nips or maybe both next time.

I used the Corn Flake crumbs rather than bread crumbs, low fat cheddar and reduced fat butter and it was still delicious and moist!!

Did as others recommended and put a thin layer of bread crumbs in my pan, next time I will NOT do this. The breading was far too thick on the bottom. I did not dump the rest of the butter on top, that's insanity lol, so I just drizzled a little with a spoon. The only thing I changed was used a Mexican blend shredded cheese instead of straight cheddar because that's what I had on hand. Was very yummy with the broccoli Alfredo pasta side I made with it. Super easy!

Absolutely fantastic!  My husband is kind of a picky eater and isn't even that big a fan of chicken but he loved this dish and it's now become a favorite of ours.  There isn't a single thing I would change about it, it's perfect!

This was so easy and tasted yummy.  I will definitely make again.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using Thyme in place of oregano since I was out of it.   It's a little high in fat content so I would like to figure out a way to reduce the fat...possibly use olive oil/butter mix with the garlic.  Thanks for another recipe to add to our menu; especially with picky eaters!

This is the most amazing chicken recipe ever. One day I was looking for a recipe that I could use with items I already had in the house. I didn't feel like going to the supermarket. So I randomly came across this recipe and made it. My boyfriend and I loved it. Since then I've given the recipe to my "daughter-in law", my aunt and some friends. Everyone has fallen in love with this recipe. It's  so easy to make and every time I make it, the chicken is so juicy and tender. You can't go wrong making this chicken. Everyone will love it.

Easy to make and so good! Added a few extra spices, and cooked about 10 minutes longer. Came out very moist. My family loved it and wanted to know when we're having it again.

Very tastey and juicy chicken.  I made no changes to the recipe other than baking for 45 minutes since my chicken breasts were quite large.
My husband loved it!

Didn't add parm cheese because I didn't have any. Also, I added a little more spice than called for. Recipe makes more crumbs than necessary if just you and Steven. Consider reducing to avoid waste.

I'm not a huge fan of baked chicken (well, of any chicken, truth be told), but this dish had enough flavor to win me over.  The family enjoyed it too, and the kids aren't really big on heavy spices, so the balance was just right.

Nothing  special.  Made this as advertised, and it is basically homemade Shake n Bake with less flavor.  Not bad, not great, just ok.  I'll use Shake n Bake next time.

Just average for me.  Too buttery, not textured enough but easy enough to make interesting adjustments.

Just made this recipe tonight & am very pleased. The chicken came out very tender & moist inside, yet slightly crispy from the bread crumbs & cheddar cheese. This was very easy to make & I will be doing it again.

This dish was so good. I made a change in the recipe, I put Kraft Parmesan Cheese instead of freshly grated Parmesan due to the fact I didn't have freshly Parmesan cheese. It turned out delicious.

Delicious. I've been cooking for my family a few times a week to help my parents out, and this was quick, easy, and the entire family (plus a friend) loved it. The only change I made was adding a bit more parsley and 1/2 tsp paprika for color.

4.5 stars, mainly because my breading did not crisp as much as I would have liked.  I did take reviewers' suggestions and put a layer of breading on the bottom of the dish and I think it helped.  I did not have time for the garlic butter saute and used garlic olive oil.  We thought it was very tasty and probably saved some calories.  This is the first breaded recipe I have found where there was actually enough breading!

I omitted the cheddar cheese, only using Parmesan simply because I don't care for cheddar cheese on chicken.  
I browned both sides first, using my oven proof skillet, then baked for the 30 min still because I hadn't pounded the breasts too thin.
Thanks for sharing this one - we all loved it!

Very good!  Followed advice of others and put a thin layer of bread crumbs at the bottom, to prevent the chicken from becoming soggy.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great recipe!  It was flavorful and tender.  I took one of the suggestions and place a cooling rack over the pan so the chicken didn't sit in the butter mixture.  It came out wonderful.  I couldn't believe that something so easy to make could taste so great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago and have been craving it ever since. I must say I have tried many chicken recipes and this is by far one of my favorites! My whole family liked it which is a huge accomplishment in my household. (two picky kids, and a picky husband) I didn't change a thing and followed the directions exactly.

We LOVED this! I did a couple of substitutions. I didn't have any dry bread crumbs, so I used Parmesan Garlic Cheese-Its crushed.  I only had 1/4 c. Parmesan, so I added 1/4 c. Shredded fresh Locatelli Romano Cheese. I also only used 4 chicken breast halves, pounded. I had some trouble getting the dry mixture to stick to the butter soaked chicken, so I ended up just pouring it it over the top to finish it off.

Mmmmm.... so yummy!

I'm not the best cook, but this was delicious!!...and very easy to make. I followed the suggestion posted by others and put some of the bread crumb mixture on the bottom of the dish and that make the chicken nice and crispy. It is the best thing I have cooked in a long time

Delicious! I wanted to make sure I got a crust, so I first dipped my chicken breasts (not pounded flat) in egg/water, then the bread crumb mixture (to which I added garlic powder and montreal steak seasoning) without the cheddar cheese. I then browned the chicken in the pan with the garlic and butter before popping it in the oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I topped the chicken with the cheddar and baked for another 15 minutes so it would melt. Divine with green beans and mashed potatoes.

Oh yes, this is delicious!! Followed directions exactly. You MUST pount down your chicken breasts, that's what makes chicken so moist. Anyway, I did have too much dry mixture leftover, so I will cut back a bit on that next time, but this was one of the best baked chicken recipes I have made.

Very good recipe! My husband loved it! I added the extra crumbs on the bottom for added crispiness, and it turned out well, other than the crust didn't stick very well. I might try egg next time.

I have only been seriously cooking for a little over a year, but this is by far the most requested dinner my husband and son (who is 3) have.  I make it once a week for my boys and we never have any leftovers.  It is so simple, yet so delicious!

My family loved this.  I melted the butter and mixed garlic in the morning before work so the butter and garlic flavor could mix and it ws delicious!  I will definatly be making this again.  My 9 year old even loved it.  He dipped it in Ranch dressing which seemed to be a good dipping sauce if you have a dipper like I do.  ENJOY WE SURE DID!

This recipe is absolutely delicious...after starting to make it I realized I didn't have bread crumbs so I used oatmeal. It tasted great, my husband and I both loved it...I would probably stick with the oatmeal rather than the bread crumbs.

This recipe seemed easy enough, so I decided to give it a try for my boyfriend and I. It was delicious!! The only thing I did differently was add a quarter cup of italian dressing to the butter and garlic before dipping the chicken. I then baked them for 30 minutes, drizzled with italian dressing, and left them in the oven (turned off) for 10 more minutes. It was soo good, and my picky boyfriend LOVED it.

I used 3 chicken breast split into 6 pieces yet made the same about of ingredients. I didn't have the herbs and used Italian seasonings and panko bread crumbs. I had to make more of the garlic butter since it seems like after the 2nd breast, it was gone. While it was in the oven, my husband came home and first words were, "Wow, I smell garlic!" We ate it with plain white rice and we loved it. Next time, I'm going to try it with spaghetti.

Chicken was great last night for dinner, even better as leftover at lunch today. I did modify it some though, didn't have enough bread crumbs so I crushed up some french fried onions and added them to the dipping...

Was pressed for time, used Italian seasoning as I had no parsley, used bone-in breasts which were pretty large, so I baked for an hour instead of 30 minutes.  Was impressed with how moist the breasts were, and the coating was very flavorful, if a little soggy on the bottom (but still tasted good).  Everyone liked these, I will make them again.

Excellent easy dish! Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm goo g to try using chicken tenders because the brewers were so thick and put the oregano and parsley in the butter.

I have one of the pickiest eaters (5yr old). No green veggies, one day she likes something, the next shes turning up her nose. I served the dish with pan cooked butter potatoes and green beans...she asked for seconds!. Wonderful recipe. Definitely a keeper in my house =)

This was a delicious recipe! I made two slight changes....Frist I used Panko crumbs in place of the bread crumbs as I LOVE their crunchiness! Secondly, I didn't put the Cheddar in the crumb mix....I was out and my hubby wasn't home in time with it, si I just added grated cheedar on top on each breast for the last 10 minutes of the backing time.  I did find that it took longer to cook, so for the last 10 minutes I bump the over temperature up to 400F. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family did! (Three kids ages 11,8 and 6)

Awesome! My husband, the guy who normally loads any type of chicken with BBQ sauce, ate this just as I prepared it and said it was wonderful. I didn't vary from the recipe at all.

My wife and I loved it!!!!  Cut the recipe in half, and she still had plenty to eat with 1/2 a breasts.  I didn't pound mine flat, so we had plump, juicy breasts.  I will definately do this again....and soon!

Very good and easy to make. I served with a Vegetable Medley; frozen vegetables microwaved and I drizzled a similar garlic sauce on them...butter, garlic, parmesan cheese, and lemon concentrate.

Scaled this down to 2 for just my husband and me and used italian breadcrumbs and it was perfect.  We loved it.  I covered the bottom of the pan with some breadcrumbs to help prevent sogging, but it didn't really help too much.  I also turned on the broiler for a minute or so after it cooked, to help crisp it up even more.  Very good!

This was a deeeelicious recipe! My husband and I made it for some friends a couple weeks ago and it was a hit!  The only things we did different were just cutting the breasts in half instead of pounding them thin and we opted to marinate the chicken for an hour or so with olive oil, salt & pepper and thyme.  Otherwise, we stuck to the recipe.  Turned out wonderful.  We served it with roasted red potatoes and corn on the cob!

I would give this even more starts if I could. Great way of making Chicken. I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese, as well as a little extra garlic. Once I was done covering all the chicken I topped them with the rest of the cheese/bread crumb mix as I did not want to throw it out. The chicken was nice and moist in a perfect cheese crust. I know some reviews say it was plain, the family and I  have to disagree. It was full of flavor!!! This will be on our table more often... nice way of changing things up. Thank you!!!

Great recipe. The garlic and butter coating made all the difference. I used slightly less butter than called for as well as an extra clove of garlic, and it was perfect.

I made this true to the recipe and it was OK but pretty bland. I would like to try it again marinating the chicken with Italian dressing first as others suggested. I tried putting a layer of the crumb mixture on the bottom to keep it from getting soggy like some people suggested and it didn't really seem to help. The crust was nice and crunchy but the chicken laked flavor.

This was an overall good dish. I have a child that wont eat anything with cheese so he ended up with everything except cheese. I tasted his and it was really good as is. I like dipping my chicken in butter even after its cooked and this one had a nice buttery taste to it.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipies. I love the flavor of the garlic and cheese. I did not have shredded parmesan so I used the grated (in can). I am NOT a parmesan fan at all and was worried how this would come out. It is fantastic. Next time I am going to use shredded parmesan because I believe it will make a difference and be more flavorful.

This was just delicious!  I only needed to feed four, so I halved the chicken and the butter and used less cheese, but left everything else the same.  The flavor was just great and the breading came out nice and crispy from the oven.

Kids and husband loved it, giving this recipe five stars!  My one year old ate seconds... very bizarre!  I, however, agree with the others that say too much butter.  Made it taste a little heavy.  If I were rating for myself only, I'd say four stars, but... will definitely make again, substituting butter.  This was a big hit, thanks!

Excellent meal deal!  Quick and easy and can go with a variety of sides.  Always a winner in our household.  My wife sometimes works late around 8-8:30pm and I sometimes have to pitch in on the cooking.  I have to say this is definately a great recipe.  I use olive oil instead of butter and I use gralic powder instead of minced garlic.  A little quicker and healthier.

Yummy and easy to prepare.  It's a keeper, but didn't knock my socks off.  Also, it cooked up faster than 30 minutes, so make sure you watch it in the oven!

This is a keeper! Very delicious! I followed the instructions to a "t" withthe exception on drizzling the remaining garlic butter over the top of the chicken breast. I figured it had enough fat as it was.

I made this a few nights ago for dinner and my family loved it. I did do a few things different. First I used 3 large bonless skinless chicken breast and didn't pound them flat. Second I didn't melt the butter and garlic i just used some garlic butter I got from the store and just coated the chicken with that (I figured the bread crumbs would stick better and they did). I also used mozzarella cheese because that is what I had. I then baked the chicken about 20 mins then flipped it over so the bottem could get golden and wouldn't bet soggy( we hate soggy food). It turned out prefect!! I am planning on making this again and this time I want to use the cheddar cheese.

This chicken is GREAT!!! I don't even like chicken that's how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly except at the end where your suppose to drizzle left over butter onto chicken ( trying to save a few calories) turned out great my chicken was not mushy at all it was actually quit crispy maybe that's the trick I don't know but I loved this recipe!

Yummy!  Highly recommended. This was a easy, fast and delicious recipe.  I agree with sprinkling some bread crumbs in the baking dish before adding the chicken.    I'm cooking it again tonight for friends with some mashed red potatoes and fresh carrots and string beans.  Enjoy

So easy to make!  Coating was crunchy and chicken didn't turn out soggy.  Only change I made was used Cheddar Jack cheese instead of just Cheddar.  It was delicious!!  Definitely would make again.

Excellent recipe, my wife and I loved it.  I broiled it for a few minutes at the end to give the top a nice crunch, other than that, I followed recipe exactly.  We'll be having this one again!

This recipe was delicious. No leftovers here. I made this last week with pasta and salad and the entire family agreed that it would be best with potatoes, preferably mashed. Definitely use fresh garlic and the suggestions of using a rack or placing breadcrumbs in the pan first are good ideas. It was a little soggy but tender and flavourful. I'm making this again tomorrow for company.

After making this a few more times I've made some changes.  I don't use nearly as much butter, and often substitute olive oil.  I also add some other seasonings and use crushed seasoned croutons.  Adding more cheese towards the end of cooking really helps too, especially if it's a sharp cheddar.  I may try this with fish as well.

This was a great simple recipe.  Everyone in my family loved it, including my 2.5 year old.  We did reduce the butter and used flavored croutons.  I think next time we might add more cheese on top part way through the cooking. It's not very complex for flavors, but you can make up for that with a flavorful side.  I think the simple flavors work well though.  We served it with scalloped potatoes and it was a great meal.

This was very good.  My husband made this tonight for dinner since I had to work really late and it was so good.  We didn't have dried parsley so he substituted thyme and it was fine.  Our chicken breasts were large so we cooked it longer at 400 degrees since our oven is slow. Great and easy recipe!

Everyone liked this.  The bottom was mushy though.  I tried a second batch with less butter and it wasnt as mushy but kind of dry.  Looking for solutions.

I tried this again years later, 3 half breasts cut in half, cut ingredients in half. Kids are now older and said its the best ever. We also didn't use the cheddar.

This has become one of my favorite ways to make chicken. Be careful with the last step of drizzling the remaining butter over the chicken, because it can become a bit greasy! But it is still delicious!

We've made this recipe several times now and LOVE it!  We did make a few changes, however.  I use about 1/2 as much butter and only 2 cloves garlic.  Also, instead of bread crumbs I use crushed seasoned croutons; it gives a much heartier crunch.  I throw in some Montreal Chicken Seasoning OR Crushed Red Pepper to add a bit of a kick.  Definitely a good recipe that has become a staple in our home!  Thanks!!

I enjoyed this chicken. For a cheese lover like me it was a nice change of pace from the usual Parmesan cheese alone. I used nuggets sized chicken breasts which were pre-marinated in a mix of herbs to make these. The chicken came out moist and very flavourful and I enjoyed the coating very much! I did use Italian breadcrumbs cause that's what I had on hand and left out the dried herbs because of this. I also melted some extra butter and drizzled it over the top before baking. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. Followed the recipe exactly - although I did put it under the broiler for the last few minutes just to give it extra crisp. My only complaint is that there is not enough breading per bite of chicken so I think if I make it again I will used chicken tenders or thin-sliced Chicken breasts.

very good recipe; the garlic in the butter makes a big difference; don't skip it, and PLEASE use the real deal. The tip to put a thin layer of breadcrumbs worked well to keep the bottoms crispy. And the panko crumbs truly do work to crisp up the final products. Here's a tip for the beginning (or lazy) cooks: you may do this recipe and not pound the breasts; just cook them for an hour rather than the stated 30 minutes, and they'll come out the same. The reason to pound is to keep the meat cooked uniformly, so you may find that the thinnest eand of the breasts are too dry if you don't pound them.

These were fairly simple to make and pretty good, but next time will try to cut down on the butter and cheese to make them a bit more healthy.

I can hardly wait for this to come out of the oven, it smells so wonderful. My husband is a meat & potatoes kinda guy, but LOVES this chicken.  We have it at least once a week.  Everything is usually in the fridge.  It's a great quick meal that I don't have to stand over the stove for 1/2 hour cooking.  Love it!

YUMMM! This smelled so good baking in the oven. :) I didn't have any oregano or parsley so I used dry Italian seasoning instead. I read the reviews after the fact and I will definitely be adding extra bread crumbs to the bottom of the dish before baking to prevent the chicken from becoming soggy. Boyfriend said it was "missing something." He's overly picky though!

This was really tasty.  Nice to have something different for chicken.  I used panko bread crumbs and cooked it on a baking stone.  I threw some bread crumbs under the chicken as recommended and it wasn't soggy at all. I did coat the chicken in butter but didn't put the extra on top.  It didnt't need it (and that might add to the sogginess).

Great recipe.  I added a little flour into the recipe so that it would brown and not remain soggy in the pan!  Will make it often from now on.

I liked this recipe.  The chicken baked up great and had good flavor.  I'm giving it only 5 stars because it wasn't a big hit with my kids.  Don't know if it had too much garlic for them or they just weren't in the mood.  I'll definately try it again.  I did use another user's recommendation of dredging the chicken in flour first to help the coating adhere better.  And using foil on the pan really helps in cleanup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this dish yesterday and my husband and I enjoyed it. It would be great served with pasta like linguini or something of the like and a creamy sauce or butter and herb. I took the suggestions of others and put bread crumbs in the bottom of the pan. I also cooked it for 27 minutes and then turned the broiler on Hi and let the chicken cook another 2 minutes. It turned out with just enough crispiness. I will make this again.

This was fantastic!  My family loved it, even my mom who is often fussy about how her food is.  I used Rice Krispies instead of bread crumbs for the outside coating since that's all I had, but other than that I followed the recipe as prescribed.  Yummy!

So easy to make yet still makes a great impression at the dinner table!  Chicken was incredibly moist!  This is also a great recipe b/c everything is usually already in your kitchen as far as the ingredients go.

This is a staple in our house, for the past few years I've made it at least 1x a month.  I normally put the butter and garlic in my small cast iron pot in the oven while it's preheating and it combines the flavors nicely while I prepare everything else.  I like a really crunchy crust so I mix in crushed garlic cheddar croutons for 1/2 of the amount of bread crumbs.  Thank you for posting it!

Tried this for dinner, and it was a BIG HIT!  Very juicy and flavorful.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Absolutely yummmy!

Very good. The chicken came out moist and tender and the parmesan and garlic mixture gave it just enough flavor to not be bland but light enough to easily pair it with a side dish.  One thing I will change next time is to not mix the cheeses with the breadcrumbs, non of that stuck to the chicken during dipping so would probably be best just to sprinkle over the chicken. 4 stars because it didn't reheat well, and leftovers are important in this house.

Use olive oil instead of butter, and it still turns out great, and is healthier!

This went over very well with everyone I made it for the other night! Even my ridiculously picky husband - who gave it a skeptical look when I was initially mixing all the ingredients together - who found he actually really liked it. 
I made a couple small changes... more or less just with the preparation method. I cut the amount of butter down to half, and didn't even end up using all of it. I brushed the breasts with the melted butter, sprinkled it with garlic powder, salt, pepper and oregano, added 2 tb shredded cheddar and 1 tb shredded parm on each breast, crumbled two ritz crackers over each (instead of bread crumbs) and garnished with parsley.

Followed others suggestions and used a mixture of Italian and panko breadcrumbs.  Baked on a Pampered Chef baking stone, and the chicken was nice and crispy.   Will definitely make again.

Tender, moist, flavorful chicken with a crispy, buttery coating.  I added some garden-fresh onion to my garlic butter and eyeballed the ingredients since I was only making 2 pieces of chicken. My husband and I both loved this recipe.  Easy, quick, with ingredients I keep in the kitchen. This will become a staple in our house!

This was a hit at my house. My husband and I made it together and this was the first chicken dish that my husband didn't feel the need to put hot sauce on. Paired this with a side of spaghetti marinara to make this a perfect meal.

Delicious! Took some commentor's advice and covered the bottom of my casserole dish with crushed croutons to keep the bottom crispy, and it worked great! I adjusted the recipe to feed my family of 4,but found that 6 rather than 2 cloves of garlic fitted better. I also added some crushed cornflakes into my breading mixture, and that was a nice addition. I found it only took 18 minutes to bake, so don't take the recipe's recommendation! I did however broil it for 2 minutes afterwards, based on one commentor's advice, and it got more brown than I would have liked. So be careful! I don't think broiling is really necessary... it's crispy enough without it I'm sure! Everyone kept raving about this chicken all night. Ooooh, and it smelt GREAT while I was cooking it! Great served with a simple iceberg lettuce salad :)

Yummy, yummy!  I used some of the tips listed by the other users like mixing 1/2 oil & 1/2 butter & putting breadcrumbs at the bottom of the pan to keep the chicken from getting soggy.  I recieved so many compliments on this dish, I will definetly be making it weekly!

This chicken definitely deserves a "hall of fame" rating!  Is is soooo good!  The only change I made was to replace half of the butter with olive oil to make it a "tad" healthier.  I was tempted to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs, but decided to follow the recipe and use plain, with the seasonings added.  It's perfect that way - just the oregano, salt, pepper, and then the garlic from the sauce.  Yum!

This recipe is delicious!  It provides a different "spin" on chicken.  My husband is a picky eater, but loved this recipe!  I just put foil down to eliminate the mess from the oven baked cheese.  Thanks!

This was fantastic--even my picky eaters cleared their plates! I followed others' suggestions, using Panko instead of regular bread crumbs, greasing the pan and sprinkling a few crumbs in there first. It was perfect! We'll have this again and again!

I used this recipe for halibut instead of chicken. Delightful change of pace! Made year old halibut moist and tasty!

Wow! This was so easy and delicious! My husband and 2 year old daughter ate it all up. I didn't have fresh parmesan cheese so I used the grated parmesan from a container and it was still amazing. Definitely a new staple in our house!

My family loved this. The chicken was super moist and full of flavor. I used a half stick of garlic butter, melted it and let the chicken sit in it to absorbe the flavor.  I also added a little bit of chayenne pepper to the bread crumbs for a little kick.. other than that everything was the same..awsome

This looked and smelled great while cooking.  But the end result was just ok for us.  It was tasty don't get me wrong, but just no wow factor for us and a little on the dry side.

My sweet friend made this for us and brought it to our house and it was absolutely delicious!  She used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  My 4 and 2 year children loved it too!  A big hit!!!

The chicken in this dish turned out fantastic even though my friend and I neglected to look at the serving size and had way to much seasoning for 4 peaices of chicken. None the less, it turned out perfectt and exceptionally juicy. We paired it with Mara's Rice, from this web page, but we found that both dishes were quite heavy. Best served with something light, like a salad.

This was a very good recipe.  I modified based on items on hand.  Used an Italian Blend dry spice instead of Oregano, Salt, & Pepper.  I think I overcooked slightly, 'cause the chicken was a little dry.  I don't believe this was the recipes fault.  Thanks for submitting!  I will definitely make again.

This was good. I used italian panko and floured chicken before dipping in garlic butter. Still had trouble with panko mixture sticking to chicken, but I just pressed it on there and it worked. Served with side of roasted potatoes from the grill. Boyfriend loved it. We both dipped it in marinara sauce.

This is a good recipe to add to your chicken rotation.  We left out the Parmesan (didn't have any) and I did turn on the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up a little bit.

Yummy! I only used 6 chicken breasts for this recipe. I added 2 extra cloves of garlic. Also I was out of plain bread crumbs so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I had to melt an extra 1/4 c. of butter to get it to make it for only 6. I will be making this again. Thanks!

The flavor of this dish was excellent. I'm not sure if I pounded the chicken thin enough, I had to cook this much longer than 30 minutes and was still a little nervouse that the chicken wasnt completely done. Boyfriend loved it, overall good!

A favorite in our house.  And whenever I can get my fiance to say "very tasty" about chicken, I know I've done well!  Best if you pound the chicken breasts to make them thinner.  Good with Roasted Garlic Lemon Broccoli from this site and some pasta.

This chicken had great flavor and was super easy to prepare. I didn't pound the breasts down out of sheer laziness, so they took about 45 minutes to cook through. After that long, the cheese on top got a little too crispy, but that's my own fault. Very good recipe, we enjoyed it. Thank you :)

Yum, Yum, Yum!  We loved this recipe.  The chicken was very juicy and had great flavor.  I used garlic croutons crushed, as my breadcrumbs which worked very well.  Thirty minutes seemed like a good amount of time and it didn't dry out the chicken.  I will definitely make this recipe again. Thank you for sharing it. Dee-lish!

YUM! i made this in my roasting pan and was glad i did. i had to bake a few leftovers in my 8x8 pyrex dish and even though i put bread crumbs underneath, it still lacked the crispiness of the ones baked on the roasting pan.  great flavor though!

Great! Hubby really liked this one. I didn't want to take the time to cook the garlic so used 3/4 tsp of garlic powder instead. Also am going to increase the temp to 375 because the chicken wasn't quite cooked through (could be the size of breasts or my oven).

This is a big hit in our household.  It does tend to get a bit oily if you use bagged cheese, so try to get a big block of extra sharp cheddar and grate it, it's worth the effort!

Ehh...I'm on the fence with this one.  It's a good idea, but I think it gets lost somewhere in translation.  I made a few minor changes, but nothing that would really have much effect on the recipe.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and cut out the seasoning listed in the recipe.  I also stuck my cheese in the freezer for a little bit, then threw it in the food processor to make it a little finer to maybe help with the "getting it to stick" issues.  I took the advice of some of the others and baked on a bed of breadcrumbs.  The resulting chicken was not quite what I was expecting it to be.  I think that I prefer cracker crumbs to bread crumbs when breading chicken for baking.  They don't seem to stay as gritty (?) or something.  If I try this again, I think I will use crushed up Ritz instead of the breadcrumbs.  The flavor was ok, but I didn't really get much of a cheese flavor.  I don't know...this just wasn't what I was expecting.  I don't think I'll make it again, unless I do just to try it with the Ritz.  Thanks for the post, though!

Absolutely delicious as written, but I've also made it without the bread crumbs for my hubby (who's constantly on a low-carb diet), and it was delicious that way as well.  Just be sure to compensate for the bread crumbs by increasing the cheese.

This was good, I think next time I make these I will leave out the cheddar cheese until the last 5 minutes or so and melt it on top.  That will make it a lot cheesier!

The flavor was pretty good but next time I will do some tweaking for our personal tastes. THe chicken came out of the oven looking  beautiful! My only complaint, hence 4 stars, is the chicken on the bottom was very wet I suppose from the juices running. It would be better crispy all around.

Very yummy! I used Italian bread crumbs, so omitted the seasonings. Probably won't pour the leftover butter onto the chicken next time - it was swimming in butter by the end.

Amazing! I took another reviewers idea and laid a thin bed of bread crumbs down on the baking sheet. My chicken was not soggy at all. It was sooo juicy.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe exactly but I think maybe I'll use 1/2 olive oil next time as recommended in other reviews just to try something else. The breading is tasty and crunchy, and the chicken was tender. Perfect!

To me this was just OK. I used more cheese than was recomended cause we love cheese, but it wasnt as cheesy like I tought it would be, the cheese just baked onto it and didnt have much flavor, but it was a good "base" recipe, I would try it again but make some changes.

This has potential -- if I can only figure out how to get breaded chicken to get crispy instead of soggy.. My problem was most likely due to the fact that I marinated the chicken prior to assembly. Will try it next time without doing so, other then that I followed the recipe (well, other then not adding the herbs since I used italian bread crumbs). Will try again..

I really enjoyed this chicken. Unfortunately, hubby is sick so he couldn't tell how it tasted. Thats okay though, cause that means I get to make it at least once more! I liked that this was simple to make, and the breading was nice and crispy due to the parmesan cheese.

This was a great chicken recipe.  My husband says of all of the baked chicken recipes we've tried, this is his favorite.  I cut down on the butter as other reviewers suggested, but I think I will follow the recipe next time.  Some of the bread crumbs on top were a little dry.

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it! How can you go wrong with cheese and garlic? Other than using italian bread crumbs, I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was so tender. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

YUM!  I loved this!  I only had colby/jack cheese but it still turned out great!  It was a little time consuming but only because I had to make my own breadcrumbs.  I added a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes for some heat and this was a good addition.  Definately put under the broiler for the last few minutes to get the crunch.  It is tender and juicy and just plain yummy!

The flavor was awesome and my kids ate this up like nothing I've ever cooked before! But, I wasn't a huge fan of the pile of grease in the bottom of the dish or the sogginess of the bread crumbs.  Next time I make this, after we've eaten much healthier all week, I will broil for the last couple minutes of cooking.

This was pretty good. I baked mine for 25 min then broiled it for 2-3 as I found it was a little soggy looking.  This browned it nicely and it was perfectly moist.  I've made parmesan chicken many times but this was a nice change with the added cheddar cheese.  I think next time I would cut back the butter a bit.

This is a garlic and cheese lover's dream come true.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  My husband really likes this one as well.  It's very easy to make and doesn't take too much time.

Wow, was this a hit!  At the big family dinner, this was definitely the favorite.  And my husband said he'd help make this anytime if it meant more of it in his belly.  After the first batch, I pretty much had the recipe memorized, so it felt really easy to put together.  I've tried to overcook and undercook the garlic butter and it comes out amazing either way.

Very yummy. My boyfriend gave me many compliments on this. I also enjoyed it, especially the cheese since I love cheese. Only problem was the crust came out a bit soggy, so  I think I shall try broiling each side for a few minutes when it's done cooking.

I added garlic powder to the mix and used Italian bread crumbs.  Very good!  Did broil for the last 5 minutes, but started to burn so will only broil for maybe 3 next time.

I usually never end up reviewing any recipes on this website because none have been really that outstanding. But this, I have to say, really made me (and my husband) say "wow!" the first time we took a bite. Thanks for a great recipe!

i have been using this recipe for several years, and everyone loves it!! the chicken is super juicy! i have always used crushed ritz crackers. also i usually just melt the butter in the microwave, and season it with powdered garlic. i rarely have garlic cloves. sometimes i pound the chicken, but usually don't. either way i always have great results. quick and easy!

I am not a big fan of chicken breast and tend to enjoy the tenderness of dark chicken meat but this was recipe made the meat so moist. Also loved the quick cooking time since the meat is pounded thin. I have even decreased the amounts of butter and cheese in half when dieting and it was still great. Also, I used whatever type of cheese I have on hand and they have all worked just fine. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

This was a GREAT departure from the boring old baked chicken. We loved it - but felt a teeny bit guilty afterwards. I definitely won't use all that butter next time. :)

This is a very good recipe but because of the changes i made i only gave it 4 stars. Change 1: melt butter in microwave & add garlic powder instead of garlic cloves to the bread crumb mix. change 2: use Italina bread crumbs already have the ingredient.
change 3: put bread crumb mix into Lg baggie and dip pieces of chicken (i used chicken strips) in butter then shake in baggie till coated.Sprinkle baking dish w/dry bread crumbs after spraying w/olive oil(another members idea) add chicken & top with the rest of the dry bread crumb mix & any left over butter.Bake according to directions & you'll have crispy chicken (no need to broil).I served these with a blue cheese dressing but you could you ranch.ENJOY!

I think this recipe is amazing!! Two of my favorite things - garlic and cheese!!! I made the recipe pretty much as is with the exception of using half butter and half olive oil. I also used half cheddar and half mozzarella. And I used plain bread crumbs. Very nice!!!

Definitely a keeper!  I had to cook at a higher heat because of the side dish I was cooking.  They came out great, but I'm wondering if the cheese gets a little meltier at the heat recommended (I cooked at 450 and I think it just dehydrated, so it got crunchy).

My husband said he thought this was a "keeper", and my two sons (20 & 6) seemed to like it too.  My chicken breasts were thick, so I added 10 minutes cooking time, and made a little more of the bread crumb mixture to sprinkle on top with extra cheese.

This recipe was great! I "eyeballed" the proportions of the breadcrumb mixture, and it turned out wonderfully. I used an "Italian seasoning" grinder instead of the oregano and parsley, and I also used Italian breadcrumbs. I'll definitely be making this again!

Big hit with my family. I did decrease the butter by half and added a little evoo. Followed recipe otherwise and had great results. The smell was fantastic as the chicken was cooking. Will definitely be making again. Served with Crispy Potato Pancakes from this site and steamed green beans. Thanks!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I followed it to a "T" with adding a few more cloves of garlic and it turned out wonderfully!  My 9 and 2 yr. old both loved it and I will be making this chicken again very soon for company!  It is a bit rich so serving with a big mixed green salad would be a good idea.  Yummers!

This was absolutely one of the BEST chicken recipes I've ever tried!! I followed the recipe but for the cheese I used shredded Mexican-mix cheese and it worked great. It was easy and quick and tasted amazing; I will definitely make it again.

Soooo good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did dredge the chicken in flour before dipping it in butter, thanks to the other reviews. Also, put a layer of crumbs at the bottom of the pan, flipped the chicken halfway through cooking, and broiled it for a few minutes at the end. All in all, a success!

Excellent... I had too much chicken for the pan, so I fried the remainder on a griddle... It was just as delicious as the baked chicken.

This was great, the only change made was that we soaked the chicken in the butter for 20 minutes.

This was good and I will probably make it again. The only problem I encountered was the shredded cheese tended to fall to the bottom of the baking sheet and burn, loosing the cheese flavor. I'll try again! Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy and delicious.  I took the advice to broil the chicken for a few minutes at the end and we loved the crispiness from broiling.  This is a quick and delicious recipe that I will be making again soon.

Outstanding! My backing time was down to 20 min and I broiled the breasts about 2 min at the very end.

I made this tonight and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil.  I also used 1/2 breadcrumbs, 1/2 quick oats (I do that in a lot of recipes).  At the end I put it under the broiler for 2 or 3 minutes to crunch the top.  I should have turned it over since the bottom was a little soggy.  Overall a DELICIOUS dish and I will definitely make this again!

What a great idea for boring old chicken.  I scaled down the recipe for 2 rather large chicken breasts and in place of the plain bread crumbs and seasonings I used Italian bread crumbs with some garlic powder.  My 5-year-old had said she wasn't going to eat it, but once she smelled it baking she was begging to eat some too.  I served it along with corn and roasted potatoes seasoned with Italian seasonings, garlic, and parmesan cheese.  I've already had requests to make it again this week.  Thank you so much for a new family favorite!  Edit 01/12/09:  It's almost 1 year later and this is still my daughter's favorite way to eat chicken.  I like to serve it with a small side of fetuccine alfredo and steamed brocolli.

Wonderful! A new family favorite. I skipped the salt because I was using prepared breadcrumbs and used white pepper instead of regular pepper. It turned out perfectly. This probably could be streamlined by adding garlic salt to the breading mix instead of sauteeing whole cloves, and replacing the butter with vegetable oil.

I love this chicken, I've made it a few times now and am always pleased. I did put a bit of the breadcrumb mixture on the bottom of the pan to prevent sogginess. Enjoy!

Holy moistness!  How delicious.  I wanted to make this up a few hours ahead of time so I changed slightly to allow for this and not have the butter turn yucky.  I was short on the bread crumbs to so I compensated my loss with broken up butter crackers and added garlic powder(since I wasn't melting the butter with garlic I used powder) and salt and pepper to that.  I dredged the chicken in eggs and coated with these yummy crumbs.  I cut up the butter(which I only needed 1/4 stick) and laid it all over the bottom of my 13x9 inch dish and placed the chicken on that.  Then I sprinkled the cheese all over that.  So I didn't change the recipe just altered it to work for a make ahead dish.  FABULOUS!

I thought that this turned out a little salty, but that might be because I used the seasoned bread crumbs and still added the salt the recipe called for.

Not a single piece of chicken was left!  I used seasoned bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand and it worked well as a substitute for the plain and no need for the additional seasonings.  My hubby and kids for the browned crust/cheese bits left on the baking sheet!  Served with steamed broccoli and parsley butter egg noddles.

one word: AWESOME!  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I crushed some saltine crackers.  I also mixed the bread crumb (cracker) mixture in my food processor. I used 1/2 tsp. of minced roasted garlic (from a jar)because I buy that instead of cloves, it last much longer. Definitely deserves 5 stars.  Thanks, will make again!

I made this one as written and I just wasn't thrilled with this. It seemed a bit bland to me and my husband, even though I am not a huge fan of 'spicy' foods. It was, however, pretty simple to make (a huge plus with me!!) and I liked the 'outside' of it...but again, a bit too mild for me...not sure why.

What a wonderful chicken recipe!  My family loved this.  I loved it so much that I sent the recipe out to all of my recipe collecting friends.  I made it just as stated except that I had the Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I used those and omitted the parsley and oregano.  The chicken came out tender and juicy.  We will definately be making this often.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Well, I'm so sad that I didn't like this more!  Maybe I was too pumped up by the other reviews?! To me it was just like any other Italian breaded chicken dish, minus the marinara sauce. In my opinion, there was too much butter. I hate to give a bad review because it was a tasty meal. It just didn't live up to my expectations!  Sorry! :(

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really yummy.  I changed a few things based on other reviews, here is what I did:  I pounded my chicken breasts pretty thin; I used a mixture of cornflake crumbs and bread crumbs; I used basil instead of oregano; I dredged the chicken in flour before the butter and crumb/cheese mixture.  I also cut the recipe in half using 3 medium sized chicken breasts.  The end result was very moist, flavorful chicken which we will very likely make again.

Okay recipe but really didn't blow my socks off. I had a hard time getting the cheese to stick to the chicken, ended up pouring and patting it onto the chicken

Well I had chicken thawed out, and decided to try this. It had a different flavor, wasn't bad, but I will probably tweak it before I make it again. I really wish that the bottom of the chicken wouldn't of been so soggy. I think next time I will only batter one side.

Wow, this is spectacular!  I followed the recipe for the most part w/the exception of using low-fat Land o Lakes butter instead of regular, and I used garlic pepper instead of regular.  Don't hesitate in trying this dish--husband loved it as well.

this was really good, i made it for the boys in my house and they just devoured it before getting seconds, the only thing different i did was that i am an onion lover and cant seem to make anything without them so i sauteed up about 2 sweet onions and when there was just 10 minutes left on the timer for  othe chicken i added them to the top of the dish, it was great.

Wow, this was delicious to say the least. The coating cooks up so nice and brown in the oven. Tasted great, even the next day as a leftover! I used Panko bread crumbs instead (all I had) which seem to make a nicer breading anytime crumbs are called for. Thanks much!

I thought this was going to be like another recipe I have that calls for the parm cheese and bread crumbs but it wasn't like it at all.  OMG it is soooo good.  Hubby raved about it.  I cheated and nuked the butter and used fresh minced garlic but otherwise this goes into our rotation and that other one comes out, lol.

Good flavor.  I sauted the garlic in butter for 2 min and then soaked the chicken in the pan before putting it through the crumbs.

Added more cheese on top at the end and melted it.  will try again!

This was outstanding. I used 3/4 crushed Cheese It's Crackers and 1/4 breadcrumbs, instead of just breadcrumbs. Did all else according to recipe. This is wonderful served with garlic, sour cream mashed potatoes and green beans.

Very good and very moist. As in some past reviews, the chicken does not come out soggy when a thin layer of bread crumbs covers the bottom of the pan. I suppose you could use the fake Parmesian cheese in a cannister if you had to, but it will not come out with as robust of a flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I did have a hard time making the cheese to stick.  I sprinkled the leftovers on top of each breast before I baked them.  To begin with, it was very greasy.  But what do you expect with a whole stick of butter?  Next, I didn't like the sogginess on bottom compared to the crispiness on top.  Maybe you could solve this problem by baking the chicken on a broiler pan or a rack on a cookie sheet.  I probably won't make it again.  It definitely had a good flavor, but the whole recipe just wasn't good enough to put in a regular rotation.

Tastes great. Texture on the top of the chicken was great, but I forgot to place bread crumbs at the bottom of the pan as others had suggested. :(

OMG!!! so good!!  I took another reviewer's advice and put a thin layer of breadcrumbs on the bottem.  Worked great!!  Very filling but soooo good!!!  I also let my chicken sit in the garlic butter sauce for a few minutes until and I used fancy shredded Chedder and it stuck to the chicken just fine.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!  Tasted better than I thought!   I  melted the butter in a dish in the microwave with the garlic, dipped my chicken, and used that same baking dish for the chicken to bake in.  Delicious!  Also substituted fresh parsley, which made a nice color combo to the rest of the ingredients.  Sprinkled the leftover bread crumbs and cheese as directed on top and the browning effect looked nice and tasted great. I cooked the chicken for almost a full hour, though (big boneless breasts) and it was juicy and yummy!

This was good, different. 6 people ate this and 2 said it was ok and the rest liked it quite a bit. It was a little greasy though and I probably won't make it again.  There are too many recipes to try.

I made this for dinner last night, my sons ages 15 & 7 loved it. I liked it a lot too. Definitely dredge the chicken in seasoned flour before the garlic butter mix to get the crumbs to stay on. Quick & tasty. I also served zucchini "crab" cakes & steamed rice. Thanks for this recipe.

I didn't necessarily think this was bad, but it definitely was not my favorite 'easy night' chicken recipe.  Like others, I had a difficult time making the bread crumb/ cheese mixture adhere to the chicken.  Also, after baking for a longer amount of time than expected, the chicken was still sitting in a greasy layer of 'juice' that made the crust rather soggy.  I may try this recipe again, but will most likely  reduce the amount of butter, and perhaps use cornflakes instead of bread crumbs (better crunch).

AMAZING!! Instead of using bread crumbs, I used panko crumbs. This was fantastic!

Excellent! I made this last night for the kids I was babysitting - it's so easy to make and they LOVED it! So did I for that matter. I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts cuz that's all they had. Simply delicious :)

This was ok, it didnt really blow me away.  I thought it lacked flavor on the inside of the chicken.

Delicious.  Marinating it makes it even more flavorful.  Will definitely make it again.

This had decent flavor, it was just way too greasy for my taste.  Having butter and then cheese was just overkill.  There is another recipe on this site, garlic chicken, that tastes very similar but is no where near as greasy as this was.  Thanks for a new experiment, but I won't be making this one again.

Tried this recipe last night and it was so good. Follwed the recipe exactly. Very tender. Served with ham and cheese bowties. I leave the ham out of this recipe when I make it as a side dish and a green salad. My 8 year old son said it was better than McDonald's chicken nuggets which is a big compliment coming from an 8 year! Will definately make again.

This was a great recipe. I did take the advice of other reviewers and after dipping in the butter and breading I dipped the chicken in an egg/milk bath and breaded again. This seemed to make the bread crumbs stick a little better. I also had to cook just a little bit longer. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. Thanks for a great recipe. We will certainly be making this again.

This chicken was very moist. The leftovers reheated very well. I did put them under the brioler for a few minutes at the end.

A great recipe I was surprised by how moist it was! I used ritz crackers because I  had no bread crumbs it came out just fine. I will add more butter next time .I ran out while I was coating the breasts and the last 2 breasts had garlic&egg coating they were also as yummy as the ones coated in butter&garlic.

This was so good.  I did, however, find it a little greasy; but I am willing to overlook that.  I did cook the chicken longer than what the recipe calls for...I like my chicken to be WELL DONE.  Great recipe.

Yum! Chicken was very moist and full of flavor. I had a bit of trouble getting the bread crumb mixture to stick to the chicken breasts, so after I put the chicken into the pan, I patted additional bread crumb mixture on top of each breast. You will definitely want to line your baking pan with tin foil for easier clean up!

I would recommend additional salt.  Furthermore, after dipping the chicken breast in the garlic butter and bread crumbs, I dipped the chicken in a mixture of egg and milk.  Then, I again dipped it in the bread crumb mixture. I found that the cheese and bread crumbs coated the chicken better after having the "egg bath."  Delicious recipe!

My 9 year old daugter loved this. She would not stop talking about how good it is. After dinner we had 1 breast left and she insisted I save it for her for lunch. She never eats left overs. I also loved it. The spices gave it a good flavor. I could taste the oregano. My husband on the other hand did not like. He said it was dry. How could chicken that is dipped in butter be dry is beyond me. But I had to take away a star because he did not like it. I think it desevers 10 stars.

Feeling a bit guilty as the chicken is DIPPED in butter.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) it is delicious, so will be making again and again.  I made it with Baked Ziti II from this site and enjoyed a very good and filling meal.

LOVED this!! The chicken stays moist and the cheese is such a great flavor addition. I would never have thought of this. Thanks so much, I will definitely make this again. :)

When I was putting this dish together, I had my doubts about if I would like this...but the finished product was wonderful!  The whole family really enjoyed it.

I made this as is, except for using low-fat margarine & low-fat cheese.  It was pretty good, though there's other similar recipes I've liked better, and was surprisingly filling for chicken.  I think it's important to pound the chicken, because it helped to cook it fast without burning the breading, and mine didn't get soggy.  I've only seen one other person comment on a difficulty of getting it to stick, but I did too.  It wasn't that there wasn't enough butter to allow the breading to stick -- it just wasn't, uh, sticky.  (Maybe cause of the cheese?)  I made sure the breading was spread on a wide, flat dish and then flipped the chicken over several times and really had to PRESS.  It still didn't stick great, so I took the leftovers and sprinkled it on top.  Kind of a pain, but that problem certainly didn't affect the flavor.

This was great!  Tender, moist, and perfect.  I added an extra clove of garlic and omitted the salt.  I also baked for 40 minutes, turning the breasts over after 30 min.  I didn't believe how essential pounding the breasts thin was until I did it - do not skip that step!

This was o.k.  The topping tasted good, but it didn't stick to the chicken very well. This is a recipe that I may make again but would not be the first chicken dish to come to my mind.

Loved it!  I was only making it for 2 so I didn't measure out any of the ingredients quite exactly.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and instead of putting the butter and garlic on the stove I threw it in the microwave, and it cooked just fine.  After the chicken had been breaded, I sprinkled extra parmesan and cheddar cheese on top.  (Of course I didn't measure in the first place so maybe it wasn't extra!)  Also, I used a sharp cheddar for a little extra flavor.  I loved how easy this recipe was, and it will be a definite repeat in my house.

Very easy and delicious - my husband declared it a "keeper".  Served it over angel hair pasta tossed with garlic, butter, and parmesan.  Yum!  My husband took leftovers to work for lunch and said he was the envy of all of his coworkers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!
I didn't add any extra spices, but used italian style bread crumbs. I also used shredded cheddar & monterey jack cheese mix because that's what I had on hand. 
Definately a keeper!

awesome recipe, will make this again and again!!!  I didn't find that there was too much butter but just the right amount.  I added some Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture to give it some extra flavor and I didn't think that I have oregano liked the taste.  I did though put some bread crumbs on the bottom of the dish like other reviews said

This is so Yummy!  It can be a little tricky to make but here are some pointers.  I put the chicken in the butter and then roll it in the bread crumbs.  What ever butter is left I mix with the reaming bread crumbs and put it on top od the chicken.  I have used the chicken tenders too for a great kids meal :)

We love this recipe! The chicken is very moist and the garlic and cheddar cheese is a subtle flavor. I use Panko bread crumbs instead of regular crumbs to make it easier.

My husband loves this recipe.  I have been adding a little more cheddar cheese the last few times I made this recipe because we love cheese but even as is, this recipe is a nice twist to liven up boring ole baked breaded chicken.

So absolutly good. I used 3/4 of a stick of butter trying to cut down a little of the fat at least. I didn't have enough butter left over to drizzle over the chicken so I sprayed it with butter flavored cooking spray. It browned the breadcrumb topping nicely and it tasted just as good.

I made this chicken for my family (husband, 7 year old daughter and 1 1/2 year old son) and everyone LOVED it!!!  I slimmed it down by using margarine instead of real butter and it still turned out great.  This has become one of our family favorites, it was so good!!!

I made this for my fiance and our mothers for dinner.  It was a big hit.  Chicken is very tender and melts in your mouth.  You won't be disappointed.

Like someone else said, living abroad makes finding American ingrediants (creamed soups) a huge challenge.  Instead of using bread crumbs, I used corn flakes crushed up, and used more parm cheese than cheddar.  It was easy and my husband loved it!  It was good reheated the next day also.

This is delicious! Very good. I put my cheese in the freezer for about 25 minutes also to get it to stick to the chicken and it worked GREAT. Props to you that had that idea!

Sorry to say not a big fan of this recipe.  I have made it several times using some of the suggestions made by others but it turns out a bit too dry for my family's taste.

I have made this 4 times since I got it in September.  No one doesn't like it.  I add some onion powder and some basil to the dry mix.  It adds a little extra.

This was a great dish!  Paired with some grilled veggies (red, yellow & orange bell peppers & vadalia onion) and rice!  (One thing, I thought I had chicken breasts at home, turns out they were boneless thighs, but it still turned out great!)

We really love this recipe and make it often. I've made endless variations to it, my favorite using roasted garlic bread crumbs and asiago cheese only. Love this with a side of alfredo and glass of chardonnay. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  It was a little bit rich for me, I'd probably use less butter next time.  But my boyfriend loved it as is!  He had a double helping.

My family loved this dish. The only problem I had was with getting the cheese/bread crumb mixture to stick. So, I sprinkled the part that was left over the chicken before baking. Perhaps I will use more butter next time.

This turned out great. I used about 6 cloves of garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe. Tender and juicy with a great crust.

I didn't pound my chicken, just cut the breasts in half to save some time.  This was a sure winner in my house and even the leftovers were amazing!  Have to run it by the kids, but they love chicken - sure to be a hit!

Thought it was very tasty, but some of the family weren't so keen. It had a very 'strong' flavour, and quite salty, although I didn't add any salt.

A nice 'buttery' flavour, but I too had to add more butter to finish off my chicken. May mix some oil with the butter next time, and see if that appeals to my lot more.

At first I covered it with foil as I was afraid the breadcrumbs and cheese would burn before the chicken was cooked through. Then I removed the foil later to let the coating crisp.

A nice variation on an 'escallope' dish.

Great recipe.  I made this last night and it was a success!  The chicken was very moist and the flavor was wonderful,(I'm a garlic fan). My husband really liked it, I served it with mashed potatoes and Honey Ginger Carrots on this site.  It's a keeper. Will make this again.  Thanks

This was pretty good, as are most things that have lots of butter! We all really enjoyed it but next time I will try to either cut back on the butter or subsitute olive oil to make a little healthier. Also, I used twise the amount of oregeno and pasley.

This recipe was good.  Everyone liked it.  I do think it needs something else, not as garlic flavored as I would have liked.  Also, I think I will go around the butter next time for health reasons.  Maybe some olive oil or perhaps just dipping it in a little water or skim milk?

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I used chicken tenders instead of breast fillets and it took only 20 mins to cook instead of 30. I also added just a little bit more parsley than the recipe called for. The cheese "crust" on top was extra delicious. Will be sure to make this one again!

Mmmmmmm! This recipe was great, I've made it twice served it to my husband and parents. The chicken was very moist. I would have given it 5 stars, but  I did cut down on the butter, added some olive oil, cooked it for a bit longer, and the cheddar wasn't sticking too well with the breadcrums to the chicken. I did top with a little cheddar a few minutes before serving.

Very good!  My entire family loved it.  I made a couple of changes, I didn't pound the chicken breasts thin, and I cooked it slightly longer to compensate, and the chicken was juicy, tender and golden!

I agree with adenn - YUM YUM YUM!  I had 5 chicken breasts so I used 1/4 cup Smart Balance and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in place of the butter and scaled down the breading - used panko bread crumbs plus a little toasted wheat germ, no parsley (didn't have any), added a little dried basil and used shredded taco cheese blend 'cause that's what I had on hand.  I was too lazy to pound the breasts so I just baked them around 40-45 minutes on a foil lined pan sprayed with Pam.  They came out moist and juicy and the breading was delicious.  The best part was picking the yummy breading off the pan!!  Hubby and daughter loved it too!

This was fairly easy and very delicious. I only used 4 breasts and I though the amount of butter and breading was just right, so you may need to increase the recipe for 8 breasts. I also didn't have bread crumbs, so I used crushed crackers instead and it was perfect!

I made this for two useing two chicken breasts and the other ingredients for 4.  I did not pound the breasts, used panko, added chili powder along with the other spices and processed them.  It was very moist and tasty.  (used a diposable broil pan..easy clean up). Will make again!

What a great recipe!!!  I started homework with my daughter so my husband volunteered to make this and I think it took about 10 minutes for him to throw together.  It smelled so good while it was in the oven that the kids kept asking when it was going to be done.  Needless to say, everyone loved it and the kids have already asked us to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I cooked this chicken for my office luncheon and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe but I baked it for one hour.  I served the chicken with oven baked red potatoes with garlic and parmesan cheese.  Umm umm good!

this recipe was delicious, even the kids loved it. i did use equal parts of bread crumbs and cornmeal, which gave it extra added crunch. next time however i will try using heart healthy olive oil, i'm sure that will work also.

Wow!!! This was incredible! The best chicken breast I ever had! I had 6 chicken breast and for my bread crumbs 
I used 2 slices of D'Italiano bread set out to dry a bit and then crumbled into little pieces. Had a little over a cup. Looks like they used bigger crumbs in the picture so that's what I did. Used one big clove and one small clove of garlic and that was plenty. I did everything else the same except I used powdered thyme instead of oregano. Had trouble getting the crumb mixture to stick so I just packed it on. Boy was it ever good!! Outside was crispy and golden and inside moist and tender and the aroma throughout the house was wonderful. Family raved. I would definately serve this to guests! Thank you so much for this recipe, we enjoyed every mouthful!!

I made this tonight and we loved it, adding the extra cheese 15 minutes before it's done just made it perfect, I wouldn't change a thing about it, I will definitely be making this again.

So yummy! My husband loved it. Be sure to drizzle extra melted butter over the top so the chicken will brown. Next time I would omit the salt. I think there's enough in the cheeses.

Another keeper. Only thing I missed was the cloves of garlic, so I used the powdered stuff. Still tasted really good. I also waited to put the cheddar on the last 15 minetes of cooking. Any picky eater would eat this.

Wow, this knocked my socks off!!  Can't wait to pass it along to family/friends.  I used Italian bread crumbs just because I like them better than plain bread crumbs. I also added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, but will probably add a whole tsp. the next time.  Thanks so much for this delicious and easy recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  Just enough garlic and the "crust" was awesome!  

I did have to use 2 9x13 casserole pans though.  There was no way that it would all fit into one.

I used turkey cutlets (no need to pound thin; only took 20 min to cook) and seasoned bread crumbs.  I would give it a 5 but the dish was so greasy.  Next time I think I'll brush just the tops of the cutlets with the garlic butter and press the bread crumb/cheese mixture on top.  Also, couldn't taste the cheddar cheese at all so I think I'll just use the parmesan.  Thanks for the recipe.

Can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It was so tasty, tender, moist and scrumptious that I have given the recipe to my friends to try.  I will keep this as my top chicken recipe.  It was loved by the entire family.  Thank you BAYLOR66 for sharing this with us.

My family could smell this baking from outside and couldn't wait to eat! The only thing I did differently was to crush some cheddar crutons instead of bread crumbs. Next time I think I'll try using chicken cut into strips as finger food during the football games. The boys'll love it!

Absolutely delicious...I doubled the recipe to feed my hungry fishermen !!  I changed it up a little - used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and also added some Italian spice to the bread crumb mixture.  Received rave reviews from the guys !!  Definitely a keeper !!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good.  However, it is not real healthy with all the butter and cheese.  The next time I try it I'm going to use 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. olive oil.

This is a fantastic recipe! My usually fussy kids LOVED it, and my co-workers enjoyed the leftovers. It's perfect, and a great "company" dish.

This is very good!  I had doubts at first--I didn't think the chicken would be moist.  Boy, was I wrong!  Everyone gobbled it up!  As a shortcut, I used seasoned dry bread crumbs instead of adding spice.  Yummy!!!

My roommates lined up in the kitchen to try this recipe.  I served it with roasted vegetables, which was a perfect combination.  I will try the foiled baking sheet next time, but any side dish will compliment this recipe and it is definitely a keeper.

This was a shock for me.  I only used 1 cup of cheddar cheese, didn't add the salt, and put pats of butter on top because I was afraid it was going to dry out.  It cooked in 20 minutes and my husband and son loved it!  They devoured it.  My hubby hates chicken and went on and on about how good this was.  I on the other hand was looking forward to it all day, and didn't really care for it.  I guess I'm not a big cheese fan, and although I am a salt lover still found this to be a bit salty.  Anyway it will be cooked again, it was loved by my boys and that's all that matters.  Thank you!

Super easy to make and with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I pounded the chicken out thin to speed up the cooking time and they turned out surprisingly moist.

LOVE IT!  It's hard to find new chicken recipes to replace old stand-bys, but this one did the trick.  The only thing I did different was to put the crumb mixture in the food processor to make it easier to coat with.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good flavor but wasn't crazy about the texture. The bread crumbs on the bottom got too soggy. Don't know if I will make this one  again.

Excellent. I only had boneless, skinless thighs so I used those and I think I will stick with them from now on. I loved the flavor of these, crispy outside, moist inside. These made the house smell so good while cooking. I will definately be making these again and again.

This chicken rocked.  It had great flavor and was very moist.  I had to cook it for a little over the time specified by about 10 minutes or so.  All in all it was a simple yummy alternative to the same bland old chicken.

Fantastic...My husband is usually not keen on NEW recipes :) However he loved it, we had one chicken breast left over and had it in toasted sandwich with cheese the day after...YUMMY..the only thing I did differently was cook it for 10 minutes longer - DELICIOUS

All I can say is awesome!  My son absolutely loved this recipe.  This dish was so easy to make.  It took less than 20 minutes to prepare and turned out simply delicious.  I used it on the chicken tenders cut and my son said it tasted better than the fried which is unusual for a 13 year old so you know this is definitely a keeper.

A great variation of the Garlic Chicken recipe on this site (and my preferred).  Less time consuming, but also less garlic flavor.  Love how the bread crumbs bake to a crispy crust because of the addition of cheddar cheese.  Very moist on the inside.

The only thing I changed was using Italian breacrumbs instead of plain and omitting the parsley and oregano, and this recipe was absolutely amazing!  So simple and so good....definitely a keeper!

I halved the recipe but kept the same amount of bread crumbs.  I followed previous reviewers comments and placed excess bread crumbs on the bottom of the pan to soak up juices.  Turned out great!! I usually don't enjoy breaded things, but this was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe did not come out for me. Like other reviewers, the breading was soggy. I will try this recipe again, but next time I will use cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I seem to have better luck with crackers; they tend to hold up better than bread crumbs, and be nice and crispy. I also didn't pound the chicken, just cooked it a little longer.

Great recipe - quick and easy, all ingredients that I keep on hand.  My husband just loved it!  I also made my own bread crumbs, didn't toast them or anything, and used Kraft grated parmesan and it came out terrific.  I think what made the flavor so great was the fact that I used sharp cheddar cheese.  I also added a little bit of Paula Dean's seasoning salt to the breading mixture - gave it a little kick!  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful recipe using ordinary ingredients! Only "complication" to this recipe is to literally use your hands to combine the bread crumbs with the cheeses and spices.

Very good.  I don't normally like baked chicken breast but the olive oil and bread crumb crust kept it from drying out.  I used a Pyrex dish to dip the chicken in the garlic and oil, then tossed sliced summer squash in the remaining oil and baked it, covered, with the chicken

Drool, Drool, Drool...oh my goodness this tastes like scampi - one of our family favorites.  It is just delicious, I was hesitant to put the remaining cheese/breadcrumb mixture on top but oh my goodness I could eat it alone...who needs the chicken!  It was absolutely divine and we are super picky.  Everyone ate it!!  Thanks so much for a terrific Recipe!

This is great chicken, I've been making it for awhile and it's a favorite in my house...  I usually use chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, but otherwise follow directions exactly.  Chicken is SO moist and cheesy, really wonderful.

This recipe is VERY good.  I love the cheese in the breading.  I think it would be even better if you butterflied the chicken and stuffed it with some of the butter, cheese, and garlic! YUM.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome! My boyfriend and I wanted to make something that wasn't our normal dinner so I found this recipe. I'm so glad I looked at it! We loved it and so did his roommate who's all about eating healthy. Haha. The only change I made was I left the garlic in chunks so when it was poured over the chicken we had chunks of garlic. Yumm! Amazing! Will make again for sure!

I don't like trying new recipes, but this one is great.  I am passing it along to all my friends.  I used garlic bread crumbs for some extra flavor.

Tried this based upon the other reviewers opinions.  I had an extra breast so I had to add to the recipe just a bit.  Served it with a tossed salad and ziti with Italian Tomato sauce.  Quite a hit even with my "picky eaters".

Looks like we will be having this one again ~~

Very fast and very tasty! I followed another reviewer's advice and finished off with a few minutes under the broiler and that added a nice crunch to the topping.

This was definietly a make again recipe.  I thought the coating was a little soggy, so I finished it in the broiler for a couple of minutes.   I also forgot the herbs and didn't miss them at all.   My husband approved.

I made this recipe for dinner today. It was very easy to make and also done in no time at all. I did not buy chicken breast and pound it out, I just bought thin sliced chicken breast from the grocery store. This saves a lot of time. Also I took one of the viewers suggestions and put the chicken in the broiler for a few minutes after I took it out of the oven. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty. For my taste though (and my family agreed), next time I will cut the amount of garlic to one clove or less for four servings. The garlic was pungent.

I thought this was pretty good.  I tried halving the recipe and maybe I mixed up the proportions because there seemed to be way too much breading.  I'll be more careful the next time :-)

This was amazing!  I did not flatten the chicken, because of this I had to cook in a little longer.  I also only had Italian Bread crumbs and it was wonderful.  I will make this again for sure.

Delicious and easy.  I didn't have fresh garlic. I always keep a jar of minced garlic in the refrigerator and used it and it worked great.  I used approximately 2 heaping teaspoons.

Excellent recipe!  I did not have chicken breasts on hand, yet replaced them with pork chops and followed the baking time.  They were delicious and tender!
