I have been using this recipe for 20+years.....to make regular chocolate fudge- use 2 tsp. vanilla-instead of the peanut butter. This recipe was sent to my daughter in Saudia Arabia (mails very well)

Wow - did this work out perfectly. I let the pan cool in a water bath after stirring in the peanut butter. The gloss faded and after half a minute of hard beating with a big strong wooden spoon, it went into the 8x8 buttered glass dish easily. It started to set pretty quickly, and I used a hand-sized piece of foil to press it flat. 
A comment on the other review about the recipe not firming up - I instinctively added the evaporated milk by pouring in the whole can, then remembered the aforementioned review, and realized I the mistake. I was able to remove enough of the excess milk and thought maybe someone else might do the same, hence this note.

This recipe was fast but didn't set up when I made it, so I re-cooked it and it still didn't set up. Besides the stickyness it tasted ok but I was very dissapointed in this recipe, and ended up throwing it out.

This is some really good fudge, and fairly quick and easy.  As a plus, if you grease the pan with real butter, this recipe is soy-free.  I am allergic to soy, so this fudge is some of the only chocolate I can eat.

I've been teaching myself how to make fudge lately, and I've found that it can be really tricky. If you've never made fudge before, this is not the recipe for you. Beginners should look for a recipe that contains either marshmallows, marshmallow fluff or cornsyrup. If you really want to make this recipe, you need to do your research and go through a couple botched batches of fudge to make it work. For starters, beating the fudge at the end is very important. Under or over beating will both lead to big problems in terms of how your fudge sets up. Do not stop beating until the moment the fudge starts to look less shiny, then stop immediately and pour it out. For more tips, you can check out the article "perfect fudge" on this site on the left of the screen. Hope that helps a bit.

Very easy to make and wonderful tasting....if you make fudge, remember to never make it if it is raining. It will not set up because of the change in the air pressure.

This is a good recipe for fudge, but there is something that I would want to stress along with it.  You do need to bring your mixture to exactly soft ball stage.  If you dont reach it, then you will have a dish of goo.  If you exceed it, you will have a crumbly mess.  So, if you want to make this fudge and have it turn out well, use a thermometer!

Do not attempt to make this without a candy thermometer! I did the cold water test, but all I got was a grainy mess. We stirred into oatmeal to avoid wasting.

I made this just as it says. all other fudge's I have made use confectioners sugar and they turn out great. I did this as told using white sugar and it will not get hard. It's been in the fridge for almost 2 hours now still soft.

this was my first attempt at fudge and with a candy thermometer it turned out!   Helpful:   a note elsewhere online indicating that for every 500 feet above sea level, reduce target temperature by 1 degree, therefore in Calgary at 3500 feet, 234 becomes 227 degrees.  This worked perfectly.  The fudge seems to be setting nicely with a glossy top.  I have no clue as to how long this takes but am encouraged so far!

Perhaps I did something wrong in the boiling step, but the direction really need to be more precise.  Mine did not set up completely so I spooned the soft gooey mess back into the pot and heated it on low heat just enough to re-melt.  Then I added about half a box of Rice Krispies and spread it back in the dish.  It harded into rice Krispie treats just fine, but was sickeningly sweet.  I think even if it had hardened into fudge I would not be able to eat it, it's so sweet.

This recipe is terribly deficient. It doesn't give beginning fudgers even a chance, and any regular fudger knows, all good fudge recipes are finicky and require much more direction, not to mention, a dash of salt.

I tried this recipe for the first time & it didn't solidify very well like fudge normally does. I followed the recipe to a "T" and don't know if something can be done differently to fix this problem?

This was so sugary that I could not even eat a little bit of it. I changed the 1/4 cup of Cocoa to a 1/3 cup and I didn't even taste any chocolate what so ever. i love fudge but this was so not what I wanted.

I only give this two stars because I hated it. Was no way near real fudge! It turned out grainy. So sweet too that i had to throw away afta 2 days! i was looking forward to my first fudge that I cooked but  didn't like it. i tasted other peeps fudge and they were great! I give this only two stars because my sisters liked em. Next time I will read all reveiws first! So I'll know what a soft ball stage is and why it went grainy!

well perhaps it is me or perhaps it is the recipe but mine turned out dry and crumbly after i added the peanut butter.  perhaps i boiled it past the soft ball stage but i thought it was the right consistancy.  i will not make this recipe again

This is the first time I've tried this recipe. Only problem I had is it set up too hard and it was crumbs when I cut it. I'm trying it again but doubled the recipe and it's in the fridge cooling.

This fudge did not work out well at all. Very sticky and semiformed even after days in the fridge.
