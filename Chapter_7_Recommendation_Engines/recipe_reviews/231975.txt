Because I changed the recipe to spelt flour, soy milk and vegetable oil, I needed to add some extra flour.  These turned into drop biscuits instead of the kind that needed to be rolled out.  DH loved the lime zest in these, and the family enjoyed the lime aroma as they baked!  Great treat!  We will be making these again!

It turned out pretty good. I added some sugar to the dough and I brushed them in an egg, lime and sugar wash. We topped them with berries. And a little powdered sugar. I'll make these again.

Very nice! Forgot and put in two tablespoons of lime juice. This made the batter too runny! I panicked and put in one more cup of flour! Carried on with the recipe but the end result was a dry grainy biscuit. The taste was great tho! I’ll give it 5 stars just to be fair about my own glitch when making this recipe!

My first time making biscuits. The recipe is easy and delicious. I decided to go without the lime juice. I can’t believe how great they turned out!

I thought these were very good.  I may increase the amount of lime next time, depending on what I am serving with these biscuits.

Interesting twist adding the lime. Will definitely make again.
