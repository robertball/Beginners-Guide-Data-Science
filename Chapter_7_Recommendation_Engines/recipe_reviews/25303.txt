I don't typically write reviews on recipes whether I like them or not.  This one however, is a masterpiece.  My husband and picky children want me to make this every night of the week.  I made it exactly as the recipe called with some crusty bread on the side.  AMAZING! You won't be disappointed.

I made this and the first thing my husband said was that it rivaled anything he's had at Olive Garden...and he is not one to give compliments unless he really means it.  I halved the recipe and it still made enough for 5-people.  I added crumbled bacon at the end and it was delicious!!  I also added a bit more milke at the end to get it to be a little creamier and not so thick.  Anyway, it was heavenly and I will definitely be making this again and again!!

I thought this recipe was great, as did my husband! I didn't add as much cheese or 1/2 and 1/2 as is calls for which made it seem a little lighter in texture (which made us feel better about eating it!). I will definately come back to this recipe! It's a winner!!

Great recipe, easy to adjust to personal liking. I read the negative reviews, some of which suggested bland flavor and others that had issues with grainy texture or overly pastey textures- all of these issues are a personal preference that as a cook you should adjust yourself. If too bland add more salt and seasoning I added more salt, a bunch of fresh parsley and heavy cream with more milk than called for. I also changed the cheeses up to include swiss and gruyere instead of colby-jack  because to me that is what Alfredo should have. i used a blend of shallots, onions and garlic along with 10oz of mushrooms and fried it up until golden, added flour and CLUMPING is normal, you should add the liquids and mix until smooth- you must use a relatively LOW heat and mix, mix, mix and MIX while adding all the cheeses and milk/cream. If you have grainy texture this is a technique issue not a recipe issue. Overall i think this is a great recipe and allows for a lot of variation depending on what you have on hand, and that is the ultimate 'homestyle' recipe in my book. Thanks

so delicious! Made this for my dad's birthday, and everyone loved it! At first we thought we may have to double the recipe to feed 6 of us, but the sauce was so thick and filling that we fed everyone w/out having to double it.  We did omit the mushrooms and tomatoes, and added brocoli instead.  
Definitely try this one!!!

I made this for my VERY picky family and they loved it. It made my day to have them ooh and ahh over this meal. It truly is restaurant flavor. I altered a little though. Because of all the reviews i read before making this, I cut the recipe in half, omitted the salt, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I was careful not to use all the italian seasoning the recipe called for and I added fresh peas and black pepper instead of white. I'm having a party next week and I can't wait to make it again. Delicious, thanks emily!

What a fantastic dish to stay home and make. It tasted better than any italian dish I would get at any local restaurant around. That was my thinking when I made it for my girlfriend for Valentines Day and she claims she couldn't have asked for anything better. If you compliment it with a nice white wine you will be blissfully satisfied everytime. . .

Hmmm, I am so sorry to have to give this kind of review, but I was so excited to make this pasta, but unfortunately it fell way short for me and my family. First off, this is waaaaay too much sauce for 1 pound of pasta. I thought for sure with all the layers of flavors going on here that it was going to blow me away, but I was surprised that it was actually really, really bland. The sauce turned out very grainy, even though I was super careful when melting the cheese, and when I combined the finished sauce with the pasta, it seemed to seperate and sort of curdle (all of my ingredients were just bought and fresh, so...). The idea of this is great and with all the great reviews I just knew I stumbled upon a winner, but, alas, I was quite disappointed in the finished product as well as the time and money invested...sorry.

I decided to try this recipe after seeing several people on Recipe Buzz comment on it.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make it as is, with no alterations.  First, for anyone looking for a true Alfredo, this is not your recipe.  But, the combination of ingredients was lovely.  Some reviews said theirs came out runny and watery, but I had the opposite outcome and added a bit more half and half.  The true beauty of this recipe is that it is extremely adaptable.  Eliminate the chicken and throw in an assortment of veggies and it would make a wonderful primavera.  Double the parmesan, eliminate the tomato and mushrooms and cheddar, and it would be a lighter version of a true Alfredo. This would work well with shrimp or scallops as well. Thanks, Emily...I will add this to our pasta rotation.

I would have to say that I have been using this recipe for about a year now and everyone that I cook it for loves it.  The one change that I might make is to add just a little less of the chedder cheese.  But again this is a great one

As a big fan of the chicken-cheese combo, I have to say this was a great pasta recipe for cheese lovers everywhere (just be careful to constantly stir as you add the cheeses to avoid any grainines). Even my diet-conscious friend came back for seconds!

This was soooooo good! I made it for friends and they lost their minds. I made it twice last week. A couple of things....The first batch I added pancetta and dropped the tomatoes and put them in my salad where they belonged  Second batch I put my blackening season on the chicken grilled them on the grill and believe me when I tell you...You will get the urge to slap random people is they have the nerve to ask you if it good!   You will love this recipe

This is a very basic and easy recipe and I also appreciate that it uses real food and not your canned soups, seasoning mixes, etc.  That is why I prepare most of our meals, I do not want all those additives.  I wish more of the recipes on this site were like this  because I have to take a recipe that sounds really good and start looking for ways to substitute single ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Seriously, as others have noted, this is a great basic recipe. By that I mean that there are many alfredo variations out there--modify it to suit your own family's tastes. We like Italian seasoning, onion, and garlic, so I doubled them. And because I'm a tad lazy, I sauted the onion and garlic while cooking the chicken. Otherwise, I behaved. I few other reviewers made a point I think bears restating. There is nothing wrong with this recipe--you simply need to know cooking techniques. Flour or cornstarch need to be mixed in a bit of water to make a paste; voila, no lumps. Shredded cheese needs to go in slowly, at low heat. When a recipe says to add milk and 1/2 and 1/2 slowly, you don't throw it in and hope for the best. There is a reason for those directions. If you sub in heavy cream for 1/2 ans 1/2, use less flour/cornstarch--it's thicker. If you use 1% milk, you'll need more of either one. Don't blame a recipe because your technique was off. Oh, I forgot, didn't have tomatoes; used equivalent amount of canned diced tomatoes.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! I used fresh mushrooms and a lot less milk (1 cup only, because I didn't want the sauce to be as runny as it was with a previous Alfredo recipe that called for the same amount), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was DELICIOUS! The sauce was creamy and with plenty of cheese taste, but not oily and greasy as similar recipes. I think that the sour cream made a HUGE difference in that, and also that the tomatoes sweetened the sauce, and prevented it from being too salty. This really isn't your usual creamy sauce that consists of cheese, cheese, and cheese, and that you get bored and guilty for eating! I am thrilled and amazed by the recipe, and I will continue to make it for many years to come. Thank you very much!

This recipe is a great basic Chicken Alfredo recipe. What I liked most about it is that it uses real ingredients, rather than the highly processed foods that seem to appear in many recipes on this site. It was a very quick recipe, and my son and his friends both finished their plates and asked for seconds, even with the mushrooms. I will definitely make this again!

I like mine cheesy so instead of the colby-monterey jack cheese the recipe called for I added 1 1/2 bags of shredded italian blend cheese. I've made this twice, the 1st time the texture wasn't right, the second time I added the bag of cheese and stirred while adding it....it was creamy and delicious!!

My family loved this including my 18 month old son.  HOWEVER there was a LOT of food, next time I'm 1/3-ing it.  Also I didn't have sour cream on hand like I thought I did so I used yogurt instead.

This was the best!!!! My husband kept changing the subject when I said I was going to make this LOL, he's not much of an alfredo fan.  He loved it, and so did I. I used part EVOO and butter to cook the chicken.  Added a little more Italian seasoning, and thought it wouldn't have hurt it to add a little extra!  I used a pepper medley, subbed lowfat milk and fat free half & half, used more parm & less colby jack, and reduced fat sour cream. Loved the tomatoes in there, too.  I just hope with the lowfat subs I made we can have it more often, thank you!

This was really a terrible recipe (all because of the cream sauce)and I was shocked to see so many good reviews. You would be better off buying a pre-made cream sauce by Ragu.  3 cups of milk is way too much and the sour cream did not help.
I was disappointed that I wasted $6 worth of chicken breast for this recipe.

I refuse to be one of those reviewers who changes the recipe so much that it isn't the original recipe anymore.  So, without changing anything, I have to say this was not worthy of calling it an alfredo recipe of any kind.  I had to add much more milk to get it to a creamy sauce.  After adding the additional milk, it took away the flavor which caused me to play with it using additional spices and seasonings.  Even with this, it wasn't fit for calling it an alfredo sauce.  A white cream sauce, yes.  Alfredo, no.  A creamy cheesy sauce, yes, but way too thick for my taste.  Thanks for posting.

GREAT sauce, but I made a few changes that made it even greater: added about 1/3 cup fresh basil and a cup or so of spinach to the sauce. The basil definitely gave it a great kick! I omitted the tomatoes the second time around, but also sprinkled the finished dish with pine nuts, which was great. Thanks!

Someone edited my review to "i did not like this" first I know how to make a complete sentence....  Not sure if an admin did this or if the original recipe creator has this power.

Let me make this clear, this was absolutely DISGUSTING.  It tasted worse than vomit on the way back up.  My brother actually DID vomit after trying this.  It was grainy, had poor texture, and the taste was absolutely and utterly REVOLTING.  The only thing that actually tasted good in this dish was the plain noodles that hadn't been topped with SLOP.

Wonderful dish!  My daughter had requested a "cheesy pasta dish with chicken", and this fit perfectly!  It makes a HUGE amount, I had enough left over for another entire meal.  I also used just a small amount of Italian Seasoning when cooking the chicken, and added a large handful of chopped fresh basil near the end.  Personally, I think the tomatoes really make the dish - they cut through the heaviness of the sauce.

Absolutely amazing recipe!  Never, never, never again will I use alfredo sauce from a jar.  This recipe truly rivals restaurant quality.  This is a must try!

Holy Cow People!!  This is one excellent alfredo recipe.  I did make a few alterations merely to suit my family's tastes and what I had on hand.  Specifically, I upped the mushrooms, omitted the tomatoes, and deglazed the pan (after browning the chicken) with a nice white wine.  I would recommend trying the wine modification, as nothing is yummier than wine with garlic.  Very nice recipe.  Thank you, Emily.

I made The Alfredo for dinner last night.  My hubby and I have 3 almost grown sons at home, their friends and a long Memorial weekend, so I doubled the recipe.  I switched the fettuccini for bowtie pasta and substituted the Italian seasoning with a premixed Alfredo seasonging package from the grocery store..  I mixed the bowtie with the chicken sauce and everyone loved it.  Other than those 2 changes, I made the recipe exactly as it is written. I didn't omit any of the ingredients.  The only complain, I forgot how difficult it is to make a good white sauce.. LOL, but it was worth it.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Despite my mistake of forgetting the sour cream, the taste is fine, but not the best. Too much milk called in the recipe and the tomatoes did nothing essentially. The sauce is creamy though. I had to use extra cornstarch to help thickening as I can seldom use flour as thickener successfully.

Fantastic!  We have picky eaters so skipped the Italian seasoning and used kitchen staples Thyme and Oregano instead.  Also omitted all vegetables except the onion.  We switched breasts for boneless chicken thighs and then pulled the meat to stretch the meal portions.  Easy health makeover was opting for Greek yogurt as substitute for sour cream.  Still incredibly rich and thick.  Overall this was flavorful and hearty, even without the veggies.   Nice to find such a dish that borders on elegant with simple ingredients!

DEEELICIOUS!!! My hubby even liked this and he's not an alfredo fan. :) I must admit, this gives Melanie's alfredo blue (one of my favorite recipes on here) a real run for the money. I like both Emily and Melanie's versions and think each is unique in its own right. From now on, this version will be my "go to recipe when I crave alfredo with "add ins" and Melanie's will be my basic, "no frills" one. I really think this needs no tweaks, but even so, I think I'll do a couple things different next time. For one, I will not add any tomato to my pasta (my hubs & I didn't feel it belonged) and instead use it as a garnish. I will also add either chopped parsely or scallion garnish for color (this is pretty "blah" looking as is...). And finally, b/c we HATE them, I will skip the mushrooms again. NOTE: FF / reduced-fat ingredients work fine here. I always purchase healthy substitutions whenever I can. Today, my grocer had lite sour cream & ff half-n-half / milk, so I used those (I couldn't locate ff / rf cheese). Not only could I NOT tell I was eating lighter, I can't  imagine how heavy this would have been if I had not used them (my gosh!). NOTE #2: I feared this would be SUPER salty, but it really wasn't. If you are monitoring your sodium intake, you may want to give this a second thought tho.... Served w/ garlic bread, this was a FANTASTIC & filling meal. Bon apetit! :-)

I just made this last night, and followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the mushrooms. I didn't like the taste very much, but my husband loved it. I reviewed earlier and said that there was too much white pepper, but I've now realized that it was my mistake, and I accidentally put 3/4 T. instead of t. so it seemed to be the dominant flavor. I may try and make this again, but next time I will probably flavor the chicken with a different seasoning (the italian seasoning was a little strong to me as well), and either use black pepper, or way less white pepper. Or I just may try a different sauce altogether..as I really prefer your typical 'mild' tasting alfredo sauce. I didn't think the sauce was too thick when I first served it. Only the next day did it really thicken up after sitting in the fridge overnight. (LOTS of leftovers, only 2 people eating it the first time).

I made this and seriously HATED it. I had my boyfriend eat most of it because he'll eat almost anything. It was TANGY -  Who wants a sour-tasting sauce? I live off of Chicken Alfredo whenever we go to restaurants and this doesn't taste even remotely similar. This was the worst recipe for Alfredo I've tried thus far.

I must admit, this was really delicious, however, it was definitely missing something.  My husband is Italian, and when he tried this recipe, he told me it needed some lemon juice, so i stirred in about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in right before serving it.  it was very good.

Edible, not great. As others have said, it was quite "pasty" which would've been okay if it would have tasted more like what I think of as Alfredo... it was way too sweet for my tastes - had to add a lot of salt.

Well we gave it a try. we followed the directions as written.  It was OMG tasty..my husband who loved alfredo, said this was definitely resturant quality.  The reason for the 4 star not 5 star was that it was WOW heavy, and the recipe was a lot, more than 8 servings.

I've made this recipe at least 3 times and I'm praised every time ;) It's so much more delicious than what I've had at any restaurant. The sauce is finger licking good. Sauce thickens the longer its on the stove. Will definitely makea again. :)

Wonderful! A disservice to call this fettuccini alfredo...much more flavorful and interesting than that.  I added a tablespoon or so of FRESH basil - would have added at least a 1/4 cup if I'd had more. I presented this as having a "basil-cream" sauce.  I'd swear my (posh, upstanding) in-laws were licking their plates!
A bit too salty for me, but definitely NO complaints from anyone else.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I found that I didn't like, was that there wasn't enough alfredo sauce...I like my chicken alfredo a little more moist!  But this was truly an exceptional delight....my man-friend enjoyed our dinner immensely.  Thnx ;)

I made this and I really liked it.  I left out the Italian seasoning, it didn't really need it.  I made 1/2 the recipe since some of the reviews said it made too much.  It was easy and very cheesy which was great. I would make it again.

This was pretty good but not awesome.  That being said, I would make it again but would tweak it to be more 'authentic' alfredo; i.e., using cream instead of flour for the thickening agent and omitting the Italian seasoning.  Also, this recipe made enough for close to 10-12 people easily.

This recipe is FANTASTIC !!!!! Is it by far the best chicken fettuccine alfredo recipe I've ever eaten. I followed this recipe and it turned out wonderful (eating it as I speak!). I did add 1/2 cup of dry white wine and little bit of basil. YUM...its WAY BETTER than the restaurants. Never will ever buy precooked or order at restaurants. Homemade is the way to go !!! Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was good, but you need to either double the sauce or half the pasta.

I made this exactly as written and prepped all the ingredients before I started. It's a bit too time-intensive to make often (which is fine since it's not exactly health food!), but it was easy and everyone loved it. Great leftovers too, and lots of them.

I doubled this recipe for a church luncheon for 10 people.  The sauce took a long time because I added everything gradually so the cheeses, flour, milk and half and half would blend nicely.  I didn't need to double the recipe but the leftovers were nice.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because I made so many changes that what I ended up with isn't the same thing. First of all, I did NOT include mushrooms or tomatoes. I also substituted black pepper in for the white pepper and used only 3/4 cup of half and half. I also got rid of the sour cream altogether.   The sauce was very thick... served it over pasta after cooking and then mixed all the leftovers together in one container after. The mixture tasted 10 times better warmed up the next day.  Definitely suggest this recipe, as it is really easy to customize and seems hard to mess up!

My husband made this for me last night because he knew I needed warm, gooey carbs after a bad day. He did everything as written, except for adding 8 strips of bacon (crumbled) and substituting whole cream for the half-and-half. It was incredible. We agree that maybe the cream was a bit rich, but it was delicious, flavorful, and amazing - definitely a keeper. Best husband ever :)

This was excellent!  I did make some changes though.  Instead of 3 cups milk and 1 cup cream I used 2 cups milk and 2 cups chicken stock.  With all of the cheese it was still very creamy.

I used regular pepper instead of white pepper and I didn't use the sour cream.  I also used low fat cream.  Despite these changes my husband still LOVED it and went back for seconds and thirds!  Next time I'll add more garlic and more pepper with a dash of cayenne pepper.

I think this recipe has great potential to be a 5 star recipe but as is it has too much going on.  You know usually I like to season the chicken with something becuase it can be quite bland in a recipe but honestly in this one I was thinking it could do without the herbs as they overpowered the dish.  As for the alfredo sauce, I used heavy cream instead of half and half and used whole milk and it was heavenly...til the very end.  Plop, plop, in went the tomatoes and where they fell there was a ring of pink....noooo!  The sauce then became a lesser version of white instead of pristine like I like it.  I love tomatoes but I don't think they belonged in here, taste wise included.  I also think it needs less sour cream.  I think I'll try this again but stripping it of the things that I don't think add anything to it, but instead take away from the natural flavor of the sauce, which is the milk/cream and cheese.

The sauce did not tasted like alfredo sauce at all!!!  I can't tell if it was the Italian seasoning that I'm tasting, or the white pepper... but whichever it is, that ALL I'm tasting.  I've made traditional alfredo sauce before, and it was nothing close to what this "alfredo" sauce is.  Wasted food.  How are so many people rating this so high??? They must not know what real alfredo sauce should taste like.

Best comfort food ever! So nice and creamy. I used all whole milk and only had mozzarella cheese; portobello mushrooms were on sale and if you can, use them! Sooo tasty. UPDATE: Made this again and this time I roasted the chicken on a bed of garlic and seasoning; I had to use canned mushrooms and only had 2% milk. For the cheese I used an Italian shredded blend and some parmesan. Turned out very good with some fresh basil sprinkled on top.

What a great recpe!  The only substitution I made was garlic powder because I didn't have actual garlic cloves on hand.  The pasta was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

very good flavor and alternative to white CFA.  Before adding cheese make sure sauce is to correct thickness.  My sauce came out very thin and grainy.  The recipe makes a lot of sauce and can feed a family of eight.

This was probably the most complicated dish I have tried as I am a novice cook.  I think everything turned out well, although my pasta finished way too early.  
My only beef was it seemed a little less tasty than I had imagined given the time spent, but all in all it was a good dish.

This recipe is SO GOOD! It tastes like something you would order at an expensive Italian restaurant. I have a big family so I had to double the recipe and made 16 servings. It took a lot of work but was easy to follow and SO rewarding! We had extra so we ate it for left overs the next day. I was getting so many compliments on the recipe. I loved it so much I had to print it off and stick it in my recipe book. This recipe is a MUST!

Fettuccini Alfredo will never taste the same again...at the local restaurants. This recipe here is the best I could seriously eat it every day for the next year and not get sick of it. It is absolutely the best Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo I have ever had. It really makes all the restaurants I've been to like they are using the nasty ready in a can alfredo sauce. yuck! So I do recommend this recipe to everyone!

Loved it! Read other reviews.  If your sauce came out gritty you probably curdled the cheese.  To avoid this let the roux (flour & butter combo) get thick and bubbly then turn the heat off, add the cheeses and stir until melted.  
I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker all day so that I could just throw the dish together quickly when I got home.

I did not alter this recipe at all and everyone loved it. I did make 2 lbs of pasta because this recipe does make a lot.  I fed 7 people and we had left overs.The left overs did not last past the 2nd day. I am not sure how some of the reviews may say it came out lumpy, grainy or that it is bland. The only thing I can think is that something went wrong. I have made this many times now and it is very flavorful and the sauce always comes out nice and creamy.

My family loves it! I make it exactly like in the recipe with small modification: no tomatoes and, since my son doesn't like mushrooms, I cook them separately and add on the top of individual servings. I tend to forget about sour cream, it will perfectly do without, but it is really yummy with 1/4 cup of mascarpone cheese :D I never had any issue with clumps, the trick is to just add milk/ half and half slowly and make sure it is well mixed (whisked) in. Oh and it makes enough for family of 4 to have it for 2 dinners, even if seconds are requested (and they are requested very often !).

After chopping my onion I thought it looked like a lot, so I just added half of it.  I ended up having to strain it out because of the overwhelming onion taste (and I like onion).  Also, for my taste the cheese was a misfit, I don't know why I even added the colby jack because at that point I knew it wasn't going to work.  I made this for a special dinner, I can't say the occasion was ruined, but the meal just wasn't good.  Sorry :(

I was a bit hesitant because I've never really made this dish before. I don't cook much either so as I was doing the shopping I was getting ready to give in. However it turned out amazing. My son loved it and it has so much flavor. Taste like a professional made it. I'm proud of myself. I followed all the instructions. Give it a try if I can anyone can lol

This recipe is excellent! I used a little less salt and added nutmeg, goat cheese and I used a mixture of cheddar cheeses ...just what I had on hand. I also used rotisserie chicken and fat free half and half and fat free milk. Instead of s.cream I used Greek yogurt.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have mushrooms and I used canned diced tomatos, and for 6 servings I used 2 cups 1% milk, 5 cloves garlic, 3 tsps Italian Seasoning, and used Sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.  I'll definately be making this again soon.

I'm generally not a fan of pasta/Italian dishes, but I made this for my fiance because he loves Alfredo.  This was my first time making homemade Alfredo sauce, and I was pleasantly suprised!  It's very rich and flavorful, and I think the mushrooms and tomatoes make the dish.  If I had to tweak the recipe, I would reduce the ground white pepper and add just a pinch more flour to thicken up the sauce slightly - other than that it was terrific!  Thank you!

Everyone liked it alot - There was just a little something missing for me in the cheese sauce - a little zip/zing in the sauce - maybe some asiago or more parm is needed but other than that a great recipe for my first time making homemade alfredo - didnt come out grainy at all for me - But I followed advice and took my time and stirred well

This is a great classic Italian recipe with lots of great flavors! You must like Italian seasoning to enjoy this recipe because the flavor does stand out over the other ingredients. Luckily, my family and I do! I used fat free sour cream, 1/2 an onion (rather than a whole onion) and black pepper instead of white and it was so tasty! Have made this twice and will continue to make it in the years to come! Thanks for sharing!

This turned out wonderfully! I added just a touch (2tbls) of cream cheese to this to fill out the flavor. I also took the syggestion of a few others and added more broccoli and cauliflower. The meal was just delicious...

This dish was good, but not as amazing as I'd hoped it would be based on the other reviews.  It didn't have as much flavor as other recipes that called for whipping cream instead of milk and half and half.  Not as healthy, but way better taste!

This was exceptionally delicious and rich, despite the fact that I indadvertedly left out the sour cream.  But I can't see how it was even needed with all the other creamy things added.  I'd feel guilty giving it five starts with all the fat and calories in this dish, but it definitely was good!

This actually took less than 45 mins, as opposed to the hour that instructions say.   I left out mushrooms, swapped the tomato for broccoli (which my kids will eat), used nonfat milk for both the milk and half-and-half. I used at least twice the garlic.  It was great! Thanks!

Like others I added bacon at the end along with spinach and broccoli a bit of half and half and 3/4C milk.  Also used Sour creme with chives, Campbell's creme of golden mushroom soup.  Very tasty.

This recipe would have been a lot better and a lot easier if it would have used canned soup and real cream.  The soup would have made it richer as would have the cream.  The sour cream could be omitted as well as tomatos.  Who ever heard of tomatos in Alfredo?  Go ahead and used canned soup and you will have a great dinner!

It was delicious. I made major modifications, though, to make cooking easier and happier. Granted, the results were not chicken fettuccini alfredo. First, I cooked the chicken with many savory spices. Then I cooked the onions and garlic together in the same pan and deglazed the pan with a little white wine to get all that deliciousness baked on into the dish. The modifications definitely made it not fettuccini alfredo!

This is GREAT! First time I made it I followed the recipe to a 'T'....next time made adjustments for our family's tastes, but you won't go wrong if you try this one. Not for the faint of calorie conscious or anyone with cholesterol issues. Its packed with flavor and very versatile.  We now forgo mushrooms (personal preference) and make it a 'one dish meal by adding fresh broccoli flowerets. Great recipe.

Great recipe.  To lighten the saturated fat and calories, I substituted olive oil for half the butter, omitted the sour cream and half-and-half, and used 4 cups 1% milk.  The sauce still thickened nicely, but was not heavy. I had no Italian seasoning so I mixed 1/2 tsp each sage, parsley, basil, rosemary, oregano and garlic powder. I found the sauce a little lumpy because of the diced onion, so I strained the sauce before serving.  It retained the sweet onion taste, but had a smoother texture.  As with other reviewers, I added salt and pepper to the chicken: sprinkling coarse sea salt and coarsely ground pepper before cooking. I didn't have colby or jack cheese, so I used Sartori Reserve BellaVitano cheese which is a mix of aged parmesan and cheddar cheeses. Finally, I omitted the mushrooms and tomatoes because my kids don't like them.  My whole family loved this dish.

This is not what I would expect from a 5 star recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written. The final product tasted odd, and unlike any alfredo I've ever tasted.  There was a strange overpowering flavor (I think it might be the amount of white pepper), and it was extremely pasty.  Canned sauce tastes better than this.  It also makes enough sauce to feed a village.  I'm very upset, because I found it inedible and I'm thinking about buying McDonald's french fries to make myself feel better.

This was a good premise for Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. I followed the recipe exactly and found the cream sauce to be a little bland and to milky tasting. So I added a few extra things to tweak it and make it better (including a few splashes of white wine). With my extra spices, it ended up tasting much better.

Sometimes alfredo can be bland but not this dish! This alfredo was very flavorful. I didn't think that 1 Tbsp of salt was correct so I just put 1 1/2 tsp instead. That was the only change I made and it turned out great! My family liked it! This is a keeper for me!

That was absolutely the BEST alfredo I have had, in or out of restaurants.  The entire family gave it rave reviews.  I made two tiny changes: I added fresh broccoli and used mozzarella cheese with a sprinkling of cheddar (didn't have colby!), but I can't imagine it being better.  The only change I will make is to use a little less Italian seasoning next time.  I would like to taste more of the cheeses and less seasoning, but it was also great as is.  Bless you for posting this recipe - I will never make another!

This was great.  Only change I made was substituting shrimp for chicken and that made it even easier and quicker.  The rest of the recipe I even measured to make exactly.  ( rarely do that and tend to eyeball) but to be fair I measured.  Was very good.  I did prep all ingredients ahead of time to make it quicker to actually cook but there really isn't much prepping here.  I purchased a pound of cooked shrimp (31-40 count size) and when everything was done I tossed those in the sauce at the same time as the tomatoes, drained the pasta and mixed together.  It was just enough time to heat the shrimp and tomatoes w/o cooking them much.  Very good.  I made this for my husband and parents for my mom's birthday.  Everyone loved it.  Keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This came out great...we skipped the mushrooms and tomotoes for personal taste.  We used fat free half and half and thickened the sauce with corn startch.  I just realized we forgot to add the sour cream, but we didn't miss it at all.  *I helped my brother make this for a project he has in foods class. YUM!

This is delicious. I didn't make any changes at all. Although I did cut this recipe in half because it's very filling. I am a beginner when it comes to cooking, so the only recommendation I'd make is to prepare all your ingredients first. Once you start adding the vegetables it cooks fast. I have made this several times. Yummy!

I was looking at this for dinner for my family and decided to add sauteed garlic shrimp and a cheesy garlic bread. It made the meal complete.

I made it the day I found the recipe.  The best I have ever tasted. Better than I have had in fine resturants. I left the tomatoes and mushrooms out to get my families approval and they loved it!!

Delicious! I'm a novice cook and I never thought I could pull off this dish.  It turned out perfect. I left the onions and mushrooms out and added fresh peas. I also grilled the chicken before adding it to the sauce. Two thumbs up!

Definitely not your average alfredo recipe. My husband doesn't really like alfredo but he did like this. Pretty hearty & rich, and certainly not low fat, but a good taste. Not something we'd have regularly but good every once in a while.

This stuff was DELICIOUS!!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used one and a half homegrown regular tomatoes instead of the romas.  This was one of the best things I have ever cooked.  I will DEFINITELY cook this again soon!  Thanks for sharing this one!! :)

This was delicious and pretty easy!  I used 2 cups half & half/2 cups skim milk as I didn't have enough milk.  I also omitted mushrooms, added marinated artichokes  and used fontina cheese instead of parmesan.  Very good!

my new alfredo recipe! The only changes I made was I grilled my chicken with a ready made seasoning rub outside and I left out the tomatoes at the end. I use fat free half and half and never miss the calories. The cheeses are perfect in this recipe.

Very good and easy to make. I added chicken and shrimp but left the tomatoes out. Sauce thickens after sitting for a while and I just thinned it with milk.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have any half and half so I increased the amount of flour and milk.  I know it will be even better with the half and half.  Also, I forgot to add the sour cream at the end but it still came out terrific.  I used canned mushrooms also.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I look forward to making it again and again.

Wow. Surprisingly good. As commented before - The sauce is a bit thick, so it's very filling and makes a lot of food. Next time I will use half the flour called for in the sauce. Otherwise it was perfect.

Tried this on guests and when I asked them how they would rate it, they ALL said 5*!  Added a bit more flour at the end to reach my prefered consistency.  I accidentally forgot to add the sour cream and it was still great.  I'll have to try it again- not a problem at all!

I agree with the other reviewers who said this dish was a winner. It was absolutely delcious. It was very easy to make, and the sauce came out so savory and thick. I especially loved the addition of tomatoes in the cheese sauce. My only alteration was that I used a whole 6 oz. tub of shredded three cheese blend (asagio, romano, and parmesan) and about another 1.5 c of shredded parmesan instead of colby and monterey cheeses. It was so excellent, my whole family loved it! I want to eat this at least once a week!

I've not had the best of luck with making Alfredo sauces in the past, but this one was outstanding (more like 4.5 stars)!  I didn't prepare the chicken as suggested, but followed the alfredo sauce recipe to nearly a T (omitted mushrooms due to preference, roma tomates which I didn't have on hand and used only milk, no cream).  My only suggestion is to lower the amount of salt used in the sauce.  Otherwise, excellent recipe.

I have made this probably at least a hundred times. We eat gluten free so I use gluten free pasta and thicken the sauce with cornstarch instead of flour (just mix with one of the cups of milk when it's still cold and stir it in). I also just use 4 cups of milk, no cream, I just don't think it's necessary. I have made it with chicken but it is also very good using shrimp instead or a combination. I also use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It still ends up fabulously rich. The amount of salt is a bit much for me. 2 teaspoons is perfect.

Wow!! This recipe is definitely a winner...sooooo good. Followed all the directions and didn't changed anything although I didn't add the mushrooms because I didn't have them. I omitted the sour cream too because of the same reason and they still turned out tasty and creamy. It makes a lot of sauce. My best advice with this recipe would be to have everything cut and ready beforehand that way it will be easier to add all the ingredients at the right time without being in a rush. I'm sure your sauce will turn perfect if you follow that very simple trick. All muy family loved it!

Holy cow!! I was looking for an easy recipe for chicken fet. alfredo but I came across this one and although it's not the easiest it is by far the best I've ever had! Thank you Emily!!! P.S. To all of the people who are saying this is not an alfredo sauce: Go to Italy. Alfredo sauce is cream and cheese. (There is no such thing as Original Alfredo sauce) You may add anything you like as long as the main ingredients are cream and cheese. QUIT BEING RUDE AND DOWN RIGHT NASTY!!!

Amazing! My husband, kids and I LOVED it. Much better than any restaurant fettuccini alfredo I've had. This will be going in our fool proof recipe pile. Simply delicious.

This was just okay. I think the problem is both the Italian seasoning and the colby-jack.

I did love it!!!  used 6 mix Italian shredded cheese and only 1/3 of a Colby, mont/jack instead along with the grated parm.   and shrimp and crab meat instead of chicken.  You don't cook the seafood ahead with shrimp and crab.  Just marinade with the same spices for an hour.  the spinach and seafood will cook at very low heat in the sauce in about 5 minutes just before ready to serve.  Added fresh spinach just before the marinated raw shrimp and crab in the sauce and it was Florentine.  loved it.  To the creator of the Critical review, Christina (who posts she is a "Pro")  Go back to cooking school.  If your cheese sauce was grainy and your sauce curdled,  you didn't pay attention.  You didn't wait until your cream/milk mixture was hot enough to melt the grated Parm and you didn't pay attention to stirring your cheese sauce after and over heated it as in boiled it.  The dairy (especially the sour cream) was to hot and you probably had a mess on the bottom of your pan when done. 
I would recommend this to those who have at least 45 min.s to pay attention to what they are doing and stir and adjust your temp as need to every couple minutes as adding ingredients.  Otherwise, order out. It is not a difficult recipe but one you need to pay attention to while making the sauce.

Soooo GOOD!! and very easy. I made half the recipe, omitted the mushrooms because my kids would've cringed, and added steamed broccoli. I sub Fage Greek yogurt for sour cream because I do that in every dish except cakes, even tho that would probably be just as good. Fage (2% or whole, the o% is too yogurty sour tasting) is the only brand I do that with because it's so rich and creamy. Otherwise made exactly to the T. It was sooooo delicious and best of all a hit with the kids. Because of the extra broccoli it could have used a bit more sauce but it was still just fine. Will make again and again. Oh, because I have a garlic chive plant, I also chopped some up and threw them on top of the finished dish. =)

This was very good...but you don't need all of that extra fat.  I cut out the half and half cream altogether and replaced it with 1/2 cup Greek yogurt (and I used only the leftover sour cream I had in the fridge - 1 Tbsp).  I also only used 1 Tbsp butter and enough olive oil, as needed, to moisten the flour so that it would come together with the milk.  With all the parmesan, I cut out the salt and the Colby-Monterey Jack cheese.  Whatever you do, use fresh garlic and not garlic powder.  Your taste buds will thank you.

It was good, but not good enough for all the trouble. I liked everything but if I make this again, I'll skip the sauce recipe and just use a quality jarred alfredo sauce & add some jack cheese (I can't believe it tasted so good w/the monterrey jack cheese). My sauce was so lumpy I had to run it through a sieve before adding the cheeses. I felt it had way too much flour for the amount of milk & cream. It also made way too much sauce for the amount of pasta & veggies, and that's after I added broccoli to the mix.

I grilled my chicken outside & used it the next day, which was a lot more flavorful than sauteing imho. In winter months I would saute the chicken on the stove. 

All that said, this was a tasty pasta dish & on par with restaurant pasta. Thank you Emily!

This is an excellent recipe!  I have tried so many others and none of them come close to this one. My family, who I believe are food critics in their spare time, said they would pay a lot of money for this dish in a restaurant! It's a keeper for sure:)

This recipe was kind of "meh" to me. While it had all the ingredients needed to make a good fettuccini alfredo base, I found the measurements were way off and the technique didn't really work out as well as I hoped. The end result was chicken alfredo, but all the beautiful flavours I had developed were lost when I had to add gratuitous amounts of milk and sour cream to reverse the weird grainy paste that was made after I added my first measurement of milk to the flour/butter mixture. In the end I was able to save it and had a pretty good dinner, but not following these instructions. So all in all, I'll use this as a rough base to make my own alfredo sauce but won't follow these instructions exactly.
FYI, if you find you use this recipe and by the end find it very bland, try adding a bit more salt and a bit of lemon juice. It does a pretty good job of bringing out the flavours.

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half, omitted mushrooms (I love them but hubby hates them), doubled the garlic, used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and Penne pasta instead of fettuccine.

Came out great. I didn't add sour cream, and instead of plum tomatoes I used a red bell pepper. Also I used an Italian cheese blend cheese instead of Colby. Came out excellent!!

I really felt the need to review this recipe just because of how amazing it is. Not only is it inexpensive, but it's soo simple to make. As a 17 year old High School Student with a job, when I come home and have to make something easy this is my go to recipe. It's also perfect for when you have guests over because you can make a lot of it and it keeps well in the fridge. My picky 8 & 9 year old siblings love it!!!

All I can say is do not make this with almond milk. Definitely use the milk and half & half as suggested. My cupboard was bare so I also substituted the colby jack with italian five cheese. Oh my goodness. It was horrible. I'll have to try this again with the ingredients as suggested. The chicken fried in the italian seasoning by itself (before mixing it in) tasted horrible on its own; I was expecting it to taste nice, but maybe I did something wrong.

I wanted to make a dish from scratch for my son and daughter-in-law when they were visiting.  As my DIL is expecting our first grandchild, I wanted to make it a little blander.  As garlic and onions are an irritant for her, I eliminated those.  However, I cooked the chicken in a little bacon grease for flavor and followed the rest of the recipe, adding in some peas for color and nutrition.....it turned out great!  We all liked it and this will absolutely be made again!

Well my 5 year old liked it...but I would not make this again. This is not an alfredo sauce, it's more of a cheesey garlic sauce, very thick, lumpy and just blah tasting. Guess that's why the little one liked it as she's not big on spices yet. I'm not even sure how to make this good, I tried to add more garlic, olive oil and spices later to no avail.

Great recipe; I get compliments every time I make it and people always ask for the recipe! Very rich, creamy and tasty! I like to use the sauce for tortellini too. They think I have worked very hard...  :)

So good! My only complaint is the quantity. We made this for a dinner for 10 hungry adults and teens. We had so much left overs! I should't complain too much, it was great the next day too. I would 1/2 the recipe next time.

It's so good!!! Everyone likes it, though I used pork instead of chicken and evaporated milk instead of cream. It's not runny at all, just the right consistence. It was still delicious at the second and third day. The bad news is that 1 pound of pasta is not enough for this pan of sauce. The good news is that you can boil rice after you ran out of pasta and serve this sauce with it. Perfect with everything, even with toasts! And it's not as greasy as the traditional fettucine alfredo recipe. That matters))

This was pretty good. I used Olive oil when cooking the chicken instead of butter. I also used one less cup of milk and I already had a lot of sauce and didn't need any more (serving size is true). I did add some extra sesoning and pepper. I will make again. It is almost better as leftovers!

4.5 Stars: This was good.  I halved the recipe, but 3 chicken breasts was actually too much chicken.  Odd, because we always want more meat.  I will make it again and use 2 breasts.  The sauce does thicken quickly.

Do give this recipe a try. As many of us on here I “tweaked” it according to what I had on hand and to what my family likes. It is the basic rue, flour and stock, as in the milk. I used to be a bit nervous making rue but once mastered there is never a need to buy any sauce of any sorts. My only error in this recipe was skipping the salt with the pasta and the 1 tablespoon in the sauce. Add the salt! 

Just keep adding a mixture of your choice with the milk, half and half and cheese until you see the desired density you enjoy. I added broccoli, mushrooms, chicken and definitely the cheese. A great first basic recipe everyone should learn. Good posting and thanks!

This recipe was delicious.  I had chicken tenderloins I had to use up, so I just cut them into chunks.  The only other change I made was to use 2 cups milk and 2 cups heavy cream.  YUM.....

As I'm cooking for fewer, I scaled it to 3 servings. I omittted the Italian seasoning (which I didn't have on hand), omitted the salt, used black instead of white pepper, and doubled the amount of mushrooms. Next time, I'll probably double that again (I like mushrooms). Very pleased with the result - I'll definitely be making this again.

I have never been a fan of alfredo sauce. Actually, I go out of my way not to have it. But my girlfriend says she loves it and for our anniversary, I decided to give this one a try. 

THIS WAS DELICIOUS! The color came out a little darker than most alfredo sauces, but it was still really delicious. I was surprised at our nice the texture was and that it wasn't overly creamy or too milky. I definitely will be making this again!

This is really good.  Definitely use fresh garlic and red onion- it's good for you.  I used spinach tagliatelle instead of regular fettuccini, and also added some sliced red green and yellow bell peppers.  These changes make it a little more nutricious without changing much of the taste.  This recipe would still be good without the pepper jack cheese (keep the parmesan).

Pretty good flavor. Though I will say that the sauce looks nothing like what is pictured. It's more of a thicker sauce but yet not really creamy. Also there's alot of it. Could have easily halved the sauce and had plenty for the pasta. As another reviewer stated, it does have an odd appearance; though I wouldn't call it "slop." The chicken and tomatoes sort of swim in it so it's slightly unappetizing visually. But it gets 3 stars for taste.

I like the flavor combo... it does have some problems though. First, it is about as unhealthy in fat and sodium content as you can get. Lots of butter, plus 2 cheeses, sour cream, milk and half and half plus a whole TB of salt. I could not bring myself to do it to my arteries! Plus other posters noted that the sauce is too thin/runny. So, I cut the butter from 6 to 4 Tb , the salt from 1 Tb to 1 tsp. I eliminated the half and half. Did not miss it a  bit because even without the half and half the sauce was still a little too thin. Reading through the reviews there were several folks that commented that it came out grainy. That one is easy to figure out. They did not properly cook the flour and butter together long enough to make the roux/the base of the cream sauce. If you don't cook the flour in the butter long enough before adding the milk it WILL come out grainy. Basic cream sauce 101 there. In the end it still came out a bit bland/does not taste like Alfredo sauce. I added 1/4 tsp of black pepper and 2 more crushed garlic cloves. (FWIW the cloves I was using were on the small side). Also had to make more roux to add 2 more TB of flour too thicken it up. Did like the end product....but with a lot of changes. As Is Written.......it is bland and runny. One previous poster was accurate when they said it was more like cream of chicken soup as written.

This was a very delicious and simple recipe to make.  I used Perdue Shortcuts Carved Chicken Breasts, to save time on a busy weeknight... All I needed to do was cook the pasta and make the sauce. I was able to skip the first part of the recipe, by using the Perdue chicken. The dinner came out great!

Good but it did not taste like Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo or Alfredo in general. I think it would be better as a soup.

Delicious and full of flavor. Although it is too much liquid for the amount of chicken and pasta. You probably only need 2 cups milk and 1 cup half and half. I also added shrimp and it was still too watery. Next time I will lessen the milk.

My picky husband and I loved this! I was shocked. It was perfect. The only thing I did differently is I didn't have Italian seasoning so I made my own by mixing basil, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper flakes (1/2 tsp ea but that was for 3 breasts). It gave the chicken the PERFECT seasoning. Also, I only used 3 breasts, but that was plenty for us. I will make it again for sure!

This is one of the BEST Alfredo recipes I have ever eaten! Everyone loves it whenever I cook it. This is my goto meal to flatter guests with or just make sure all the kids eat.  I  have cooked this many many times and get nothing but rave reviews every time!

yum!!!  Worth the amount of dirty dishes I created while making it!  This is the best alfredo sauce I have ever made and it does not separate upon reheating.  Made as directed first time, used milk only second time and colby and cheddar cheese along with parmesan, still fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was definitely tasty, but it was honestly more like a stroganoff.  I didn't really get the "alfredo" because the parmesan (and I used the real stuff) was so overwhelmed by all the other ingredients.  But it tasted good!  How could it not with all that butter and cheese?

I made this for Mothers Day since chicken Alfredo is my Mom's favorite dish. It was easy and came out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly - no add or substitutions. My boyfriend and mother were very pleased. Lots of leftovers too which we like!

Great recipe but I added more fresh minced garlic, and instead of cooking the chicken from scratch, I used a deli rotisserie chicken which made the chicken very juicy and delicious. And I tossed the whole pasta in with the sauce, it was the PERFECT amount. I would definitely make this recipe again

I really liked this recipe! I used penne pasta instead of fettuccini and I didn't use the tomatoes or the white pepper. I made some adjustments to it but I really recommend this recipe as a guideline to make a delicious pasta! ;)

This is a great recipe! Tastes like it is right out of a restaurant. Makes a little too much, so if you are not feeding an army, reduce the serving size.

Delicious! I skip the mushrooms and tomaotes and use broccoli. This is a little time consuming so I always double the sauce and freeze half for an easy meal later. Must try!!

YUMMY!  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, making the following adjustments: I used some leftover cooked chicken (still sauteed it in the butter w/garlic and It. seasoning), omitted the mushrooms (family doesn't like them) and tomatoes, and used 1/4 cup grated Romano cheese instead of the colby/jack cheese.  Served it over thin spaghetti.  BIG HIT!

We loved this, but unfortunately, our children did not - I think it was the sour cream flavor, which I think added to it, personally, but I'll try it without next time and see.  The chicken was marvelous!

DELICIOUS! Omitted the mushrooms and tomatoes and instead added frozen broccoli. I felt the sauce got a little too thick and pasty, so next time I'll add some more milk at the end. Was a huge hit with every single person at dinner! Thank you!!!

This was the best fettuccine I have tasted yet and it is sooo easy to make. I can't say one bad thing and the greatest thing is that you don't have to customize this!! The prep on this is short and cooking this is a breeze..I highly recommend that everyone should try this even if you don't care for fettuccine alfredo this will definitely change your mind!!! Thank you soo much for an extremely tasty and easy recipe!!!!

Delicious! I made some modifications based on what I had: No mushrooms, no tomatoes, sub broccoli. No Monterrey Jack. 3 cups 2% milk, 1 cup cream. Added a splash of white wine. Added ground black pepper. Served broccoli and chicken on top of pasta, rather than cooking it into the sauce.

My Husband said this was his favorite Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo ever, and fettuccine is his favorite dish. I used whole wheat garden fettuccine, black pepper instead of white, and added a couple more tomatoes because my garden is overflowing with them.  I think next time I will try it with olive oil instead of butter, we'll see if it tastes as good. I generally do not enjoy pasta, and am always looking for pasta dishes I can bear to eat since my husband likes it so much, this one makes the list.

We enjoyed this recipe first of all. We will be eating this again because it made a huge pan of sauce. HUGE. There is plenty enough for our family of four to eat twice. I have only one negative - I'm not sure that the sour cream is necessary in this Alfredo sauce. I could really taste it and it was a tiny bit too tangy for that reason. I'll make this again but I will be leaving out the sour cream.

I have tried multiple recipes for alfredo sauce.  This was the best, by far!  I omitted mushrooms and tomatoes, and added a little steamed broccoli.  Next time I will use a little less garlic and I will use less half and half, more milk.  It was a tiny bit rich and a little too garlicky.  Still, I can say it was by far the best I've ever made, and as good as any restaurant alfredo I've ever had.

We loved it.  Will definitely make it again!  Since we live in high altitude, I may have to make a few adjustments on things like the flour, but overall, I would recommend this to anyone that likes this kind of flavors.

THIS IS PHENOMINAL and so easy to make.  I made it with shrimp instead of chicken and it was a HUGE hit at my dinner party.  I also took the mushrooms out and used 2 cups skim milk and 2 cups heavy cream, but otherwise followed the directions to a tee and it was absolutely delicious!!!  Thanks - this will be a popular dinner party dinner!

Good, but not quite perfect.  I did not use mushrooms or tomatos though which may have made a difference.  I used fresh basil & oregeno.  Honestly, was better on day 2 heated up with a little milk.  Flavors seemed to come together better.  I would make again though.

Great recipe!  Full of flavor, not difficult to make.  My husband couldn't get enough.  The chicken itself is flavorful, which I really like since many recipes produce a good sauce but plain chicken.

Excellent!!!  The only change I made was to add half of the colby jack cheese...due to thickness.  Everybody loved this dish.  I have enough left over to freeze for another meal!

I was very excited to make this based on all the great reviews. It smelled good and looked good, I followed the recipe to a T. After all the butter and cream I thought it would be so flavorful and rich... One word sums it up, bland. If I tried to do a low fat version there would be even less flavor.  A lot of fat and you cant even taste it. I wont bother my waistline with this one again.

I didn't have quite everything on hand (no Parmesan cheese or half & half), and accidentally threw all the garlic in with the chicken, but it turned out amazing anyway! I just used the colby-monterey jack cheese, 2% milk, and added extra garlic when I realized my mistake. I am definitely making this again!

this was somewhere between ok and good.  It was quite thick with the cheeses.  Somehow, needed a little more flavor.

Very tasty recipe!!  So rich and creamy.  Loved it..takes a little time but worth every minute.  The recipe makes a HUGE amount so if you are serving only a couple of people, cut it in half or forths!

I made this last night for dinner minus the chicken-just started with the cheese sauce. Everyone said it was the BEST fettuccini alfredo they had ever tasted-exactly what you would get in a restaurant. My old recipe called for egg yolks and was more "complicated". I didn't have much cheese on hand so I used sliced american cheese and parmesan and the result was excellent. It must only be better with higher quality cheese!

This was delicious!  I always wanted to make alfredo, and this was the first time I made it.  I didn't have any Colby-Jack so I used only Parmigiano Reggiano because I had a lot (it was on sale).  Even my 2 and 3 year old tore it up, mushrooms included!  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe, it's excellent and quick!

Made this for dinner last night and it was great!  I prepped all the ingredients so my 12 year old nephew (and asipiring chef) could help make the sauce.  After we browned the chicken, the rest came together very quickly.  We didn't add the tomatos or sour cream because my helper tasted the sauce before we added them and said "it tastes just like alfredo sauce should!" Two 12oz boxes of fettuccine noodles were the perfect amount for the sauce.  Last night we subbed oregano instead for italian seasoning and mozzarella instead of colby/jack because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I will omit the onions, up the garlic and add a little bit more milk since once the sauce cooled it thickened up quite a bit.

Flavorful and tasty.  Used milk instead of half/half and it was still good. Will try next time with it.  Didn't need to add the salt.  The colby jack cheese gave it an interesting flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I think 1 tbsp of salt is WAY too much. I added it all without thinking... just following the recipe... but afterward I thought to myself that might have been a bit much! After tasting it certainly was. Even pasta at a restaurant is not as salty as this was! I'm surprised there aren't more comments about too much salt. Oh well. Anyway, I still think this has potential. I added broccoli and it was good. Oh and I also used 4 cups milk b/c I didn't have half and half. Added a bit more flour b/c of that. Still turned out very creamy! The saltiness just ruined it for me. Will make again with maybe only a teaspoon or so of salt, since cheese is salty enough! I can always add a dash more at the end if necessary.

Top dog in my opinion.  I agree, it does make TONS of sauce.  You could easily cut this recipe in half.  I'm freezing what I have left over and will be anxious to see if it unthaws okay.  I did not change anything except I didn't add tomatoes on top.  I think the recipe called for mushrooms and I didn't add that because I am allergic to them.  Otherwise, scrumptious.  You do not need that much salt.

This was pretty good.  I just used 4 cups of 1% milk instead of 3 cups milk and 1 cup half and half.  Then I sprinkled a little cornstarch in to thicken it up.  I also left out the sour cream and mushrooms and tomatoes.  I used half mozerella cheese and half cheddar cheese. It turned out nicely.  I made it with the recipe on here for "The Most Incredible Garlic Bread" (VERY GOOD!!).  I spent a total of 2 hours on this meal.

Turned out great! The only thing I did differently was throw in the tomatoes at the time I sauteed the mushrooms (instead of at the very end). The idea of fresh tomato on top of my pasta (like in a salad) didn't sound too appealing. Sauteeing them with the mushrooms ended up making my fettuccini a little 'strogonaff' tasting and was excellent. I also used cayenne pepper instead of black, and a little more than the recipe called for, for a little kick! Will definitely make again.

this is an absolute favorite.  I have made it with chicken as well as shrimp.  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I would add is to make sure you keep the heat under medium when you add the flour mixture to the onions and mushrooms. I have made this 3 times within a month, everyone wants more!

You simply cannot go wrong with this delicious recipe.  We love Italian recipes, and, in particular Fettuccini Alfredo.  We seem to sample that dish almost always when trying new restaurants.  With this winning recipe, we may eat at home more in this economy.
Don't change a thing!

This recipe was delicious despite my mistakes. I forgot to take the recipe with me to the grocery store, so I mistakenly purchased monterey jack cheese instead of Colby/Jack. Then I undercooked the pasta slightly. The sauce is wonderful. I chose this recipe due to the onions, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Very good. I bet if I bought the correct ingredients it would have been even better!

This is very good.  I found the colby-jack amount to be a little much though.  I would reduce this to 4 oz and skip the sour cream next time to reduce the calories a little and still it could be delicious.

this was a really great recipe, a little questionable about using all that colby blend cheese and sour cream at first but it turned out really good, will make again

I had my doubts, but this was a fantastic recipe and everyone loved it!  I did omit the tomatoes, mushrooms, and used only 1/2 an onion, as we aren't big fans of those ingredients, but the sauce was divine.

I have to say that with all the positive ratings for this, that I was a bit dissappointed with this. One of my favorite dishes is fettuchini alfredo. I made this tonight. First of all took a lot of work...which I didn't mind, but the end result was that the italian seasoning over ruled all the other flavors so much that, that's all you could taste was the italian seasoning.
I did love how thick and creamy it was, I just wish it had better results.
I would probably make the sauce again, but will NOT make the chicken part as it was just wayyyyyyy to much.
Thanks anyways though!!

My boyfriend and I made this last night and it was delish.  I'm not the biggest mushroom fan so we used broccoli instead.  The tomatoes really complemented the alfredo sauce nicely.  It's a great dish!!!

Delicious.  Our family of 6 enjoyed this meal.  *Some things that I did to help speed things up for dinner time:  Used one large pan and threw all of the butter,onions,garlic,seasonings,chicken (used boiled chicken from the day before that was refrigerated) into the pan all at once...Once everything was sauted I removed it from the pan and added my flour mixture to make the roux, then added the milk mixture and once the sauce had thickened I added the cheese mixture (I used mozzerella & Parm *what I had on hand*)once that melted and incorporated I added the chicken mixture back in and stirred until incorporated and then added the sour cream.  I topped this with crushed Butter Crackers (ie: townhouse,ritz,etc) and if you're in a real hurry you can make this in the afternoon for sure (that's what I did) I just left it in the pan and reheat at dinner time by adding a touch of milk to loosen the mixture & thats when you boil the noodles and combine the mixture if desired or top the noodles with the mixture.  I used macaroni noodles to make it easier for the kids.  Definitely will make again.  I served this with the Cheese Herb Bread on this site which complimented it very well.   I did leave out the mushrooms (didn't have any) and replaced the italian seasoning (didn't have any) with Mrs.Dash onion & herb seasoning & 1 TBSP garlic powder, only used 3 boneless skinless breasts,no tomatoes (was out of them) and I replaced the Colby-Jack Cheese with Mozzerella (all I had on hand).

This recipe was so good! I followed the recipe except for omitting tomatoes and adding some fresh broccoli, which I boiled with the pasta before adding to the alfredo.  Excellent, very tasty, highly recommended!

I made this for my girlfriend. Fettuccini Alfredo is one of her favorite foods so I really wanted to find a recipe that she would like. She loved it so much that she cleaned her plate. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it really does taste like something you would order at a restaurant. Amazing recipe!!

This recipe was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used three large chicken breasts, which was plenty of chicken.  I also didn't have half n half so I used whipping cream.  It was very creamy and easy to make.  It makes a lot though!!  Good for leftovers!

This was amazing! My hard to please daughter loved this dish. Dropped the tomato and didn't use quite as much chicken as suggested. Also used a little more garlic. Excellent! This will be a regular dish at our house.

this was awesome. i made it for dinner for my husband and i, and was a bit nervous because he's very picky about his chicken fettuccini... but it was a hit! he loved it. the only thing i did different was to replace the onions and garlic with onion powder and garlic powder, because he doesn't like the texture of them in his foods, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Very good dish!  I cut the recipe in half for our family of 4, and it was still more than enough.  I did cut down on the Italian seasoning a bit and next I time will also add a little basil.  Loved the tomatoes and will use more of them when making this recipe.

Made this recipe last night for my husband and myself. Holey moley, I'll have enough for the rest of the week! I thought at the end of preparation it became quite hectic, my pasta was done before the sauce, etc. and I was making quite a mess. Next time I'll prep ahead. I wasn't too fond of the strong italian seasoning, and if I make it again, I will tone that seasoning down or maybe just add some fresh basil.

I made this dish tonight and even though I do not personally eat Alfredo sauce, my kids and husband absolutely loved it.  It was very easy, but I never measure anything I do it all by taste so I cannot say what modifications that I made.  I did however add fresh broccolli so the kids would get their vegetables.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was very suprised at how wonderful it turned out!  I was out of milk, so I had to substitute with soy ...it turned out excellent.  I think the monterey evens out the strength of the parmesean.  Be sure to use fresh parmesean!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe for my husband and I and it was excellent, changed nothing and followed the recipe exactly as outlined.  I loved the taste of the tomatoes as it broke up the heavy alfredo sauce a bit.  I cooked it with wholewheat pasta though and it was sooooo yummy!!  Highly recommended, will make again and again.

WHOA!  This recipe is absolutely DELISH!

My hubby doesn't like mushrooms, so I boiled some chopped up broccoli and added it instead...can't get enough of it.  Better than any Italian Restaurant Alfredo I've tasted!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! I had to change the serving size to five and threw in extra onions, mushrooms, and tomatoes but only because I already had them cut up.I wouldn't change a thing though. Oh, and I added a little lemon to the chicken (just a personal pref.) Big thumbs up from my hubby. Will make again especially if we have company over for dinner.

Perfect meal, didn't think I'd like it since I'm picky and only like three things in the recipe but I loved it! didn't use parmasan cheese though (spelled wrong) but only cause tbe b/f wouldnt buy it cause he doesnt like it! and we don't get monteray jack cheese so had to settle with mozzerella! was still great though!

Made for the first time yesterday for Sunday dinner. This is by far the best alfredo recipe I ever made. Everyone loved it! It will definately be added to our family's dinner rotation, but sparingly because of the high calorie & fat content (which is why it's sooooo tasty! I substituted heavy cream for the half and half. You just simply HAVE to try this one!

This is the first recipe I ever found on Allrecipes and I have made this more than a dozen times with a few minor alterations. The sauce is the most important and fantastic thing about this recipe. You can do whatever you like with the chicken but the sauce is what your paying attention to for sure. I leave out the Tomatoes and the mushrooms and make broccoli to add in as your eating. You have to watch what kind of cheeses you use. I'm a big fan of the pre-mixed Italian blends they seem to melt very easily and add a unique flavor blend to the sauce. My whole family loves this recipe. Highly recommended!

My kids don't like the colby monterey jack cheese or the roma tomatoes so I leave them out and this still tastes amazing.  I only make about half of the sauce because it makes a lot.  I also only use about 2 chicken breasts because I don't like having  6 chicken breasts worth of leftovers.  Really delicious!

This was just OK when I made it BUT reheated it was AMAZING! I added some bacon crumbles when I reheated it and it made it a 5 star recipe. I think in the future I'll make it a day ahead of time so the flavors can meld then add the bacon crumbles and reheat, perfect work night dinner

I suppose I must have missed something, but this came out incredibly bland, no flavor.  I was able to eat it as I cooked the chicken right and noodles well.  Oh well.

It was delicious! Since I didn't have any fettucini, I used 1 pound of linguini and 1 pound pound of angel hair. ( I needed two pounds of pasta.) It worked out great. Also, I had mozzarella cheese in the fridge; so I used that instead of Colby-Monterey Jack. Thank you, Emily!

It's incredibly delicious! The only thing I would say is that it definitely calls for more flour than the recipe intends and wisk it...it'll make it thicker. If not it'll be super watery. But overall it's great! Also if you're a pesto fan...use pesto basil just like two tblspns...it gives it really good flavor! Lastly, have a pink moscato with it! Delicious!

I followed this recipe pretty much exact. I used only 1 pretty large Roma tomato and cooked it a little beforehand (though I think the called for amount may please tomato lovers). I agree with another user's review that it's a good idea to prep it all before you start cooking. So good!!!! A+!

I made this recipe for my family and it was mediocre. The sauce was very grainy. It was not smooth at all. I gave it two stars because it was edible, but I will not be making this again. I should of just opened a jar of Alfredo from a store bought jar. It would of made it easier and probably tastier. I followed the recipe verbatim. I am very disappointed.

This recipe turned out well, though I found it to be a lot of prep for the end result.  (And I LOVE to prepare and cook good food!)  I feel as though there are other Alfredo recipes out there that require less prep and taste just as good.  I definitely recommend halving the recipe unless you're planning to feed a small army.  Beyond that, the recipe is very adaptable (chicken or no chicken, tomatoes or no tomatoes, etc.) and easy to suit to individual tastes.  I'm not sure that I'll make this again, but perhaps some variation of it...

I followed the exact directions,  I also read the reviews and one person suggested to have everything cut up and ready before hand, I would also because this doesn't take long to make and you need everything ready.  This was a outstanding recipe.  The only change I would make next time is to half the recipe.  I recieved so many compliments it was better than any restraunt brand.

This was delicious! We might have found a new traditional dish for Christmas Eve. This wad easy, quick, and delicious. It seems it could also be very versatile. We pan fried venison tenderloin in bacon grease and had that with the sauce and noodles. I added the Italian seasoning to the sauce instead of the meat. I also used Fiesta blend cheese.  Again,  very versatile. YUMMY!

I made this recipe for my family last night, and they really enjoyed it! I changed a couple things though. I seasoned the breast, added a little olive oil to the Cast Iron skillet, and browned each side. I then cubed the chicken and cooked it thoroughly in the butter with the garlic. For the sauce, I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Finally; I added fresh basil with the canned plum tomatoes.

Wow this was great. Usually after the first time I make a new recipe, I have a long list of things in my head that I would do differently but for this one I really don't. I might add a bay leaf and a bit of cayenne (family's taste) but really nothing else. I'm sure this will become a staple. And it really only took about 15 min to make. In the end I was just waiting for the pasta.

This was pretty good. The chicken was excellent! I will probably use the chicken in another recipe. I thought the sauce was a little grainy, but the flavor was really good. I might try this again to see if I did something wrong.  Also, this made a HUGE amount. You may want to adjust the serving size.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was good but not as incredible as a lot of the reviewers seem to say. I probably wouldn't make it again, I think I'll look elsewhere for a good Alfredo.

Absolutely to die for! Lots of room to modify the recipe as far as the tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese go. The sour cream really pulls it all together at the end to make it extra thick which is a preference of mine. This is definitely a recipe I will return to again and again.

Really liked it, although I lacked some ingredients (I live in small town Ecuador).  No Jack cheese available, and only 1/4 cup of mozzarella.  No 1/2 and 1/2, just used milk in its place (maybe 3% fat content).  No sour cream.  I added copious chopped broccoli and green peppers.  No Italian seasoning available, so I used a mix of oregano, parsley and thyme.

It turned out great, still very rich flavor, and likely a lot lower in calories.  We will be having this again :). Oh, yes, no fettuccine noodles either, I used rotini.

This was very good! A very simple dish to prepare but turned out with amazing flavor.  I did leave out the mushrooms and tomatoes because the boyfriend doesn't like them...but I don't think it took away from the meal.  We both loved this.

This was very tasty. However, this recipe makes too much sauce for a pound of pasta. And the Italian seasoning flavor is a little too strong for my taste.

This is a nice recipe. It doesn't taste much like the traditional Alfredo though. If I make this again, next time I will use less Italian seasoning, no tomatoes, and maybe a bit less cheese. Also, I will cook my pasta for a bit longer.

This recipe is excellent.  I liked the sauce so much that I actually made it again (substituting chicken for shrimp and adding red pepper) in order to make peppered shrimp alfredo.  My only real critique is that this recipe makes way more sauce than what is needed for a pound of pasta.  Not a big problem though.  Just boil more pasta and have the leftovers the next day for lunch.

I've never made pasta sauce before so I was nervous and wanted something easy.  Throughout the process I kept wondering if I was doing something wrong, but it came together beautifully!  The sauce is delicious and the mushrooms are a great addition.

All I can say is WOW!! Unbelievably fantastic. Followed the recipe exactly. Way better than a restaurant dish. Served with steamed broccoli on the side. Thank you Emily for submitting. Definitely a keeper. One tip I can give to the people who had their ingredients separate, rule of thumb is when adding sour cream, make sure the sauce is NOT boiling. You never ever boil sour cream. Even when adding the cheese to melt, a hard boil can wreck havoc too.

We REALLY enjoyed this recipe! I loathe mushrooms so I left them out, and didn't have Colby/Jack on-hand so I actually used a tiny bit of mild cheddar to thicken it up (it ran quite thin) but my husband and I were thrilled with the outcome. The sauce was MUCH more than what was needed for 1# of pasta but aside from that, it was truly fantastic. I will definitely make this recipe again.

One change that I made to this recipe was I added more milk than the recipe called for, because my family likes extra sauce, and we also don't like the sauce very thick.  The other change I made to this recipe was I had the mushrooms on the side, since some of my family members don't like them, and I ditched the tomatoes.  It was sooooo delicious.  The sour cream definitely pulls the sauce together.  Definitely making this again ASAP! Everyone loved it!

I don't understand why this recipe has only 4 1/2 stars instead of five... or ten. I have made this recipe many times now and never change a thing. If you want perfect, crowd-pleasing chicken fettuccini alfredo, this is the right recipe to try. Thank you for an incredible recipe!

As the recipe is there is way too much sauce leaving it somewhat bland and right on the cusp of being really good. Next time, I will cut the milk and cream in half but leave the cheeses the same. That should help to bring up the cheese flavor from a subtle hint to BAM! I also added about a tablespoon on oregano and that was a nice touch and the only real flavor I found. I personally don't think it is comparable to a great italian dish as it stands but we can doctor it up a bit as my grandma used to say. It's a good base to start with.

This is the only recipe I use for chicken alfredo. I add whatever veggies I want. The only thing I change is I don't put the sour cream in at all.

Great recipe. I had to improvise for half-and-half. Mixed milk and cream equal parts. And also you can use different parts of a chicken but the cooking time will be different. All in all happy cooking enjoyed the meal. I'm a rookie in the kitchen.

My girlfriend made the pasta and we loved it. She did tweak it a bit because we didn't have all of the ingredients. She used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half. And she used cream cheese instead of the colby-monterey. She did have to add more flour to thicken the sauce and she didn't add the mushrooms or tomatoes.

ITALIAN SEASONING... this one ingredient RUINED the Alfredo sauce for my family. The recipe seemed popular with good reviews, so I decided to try it exactly as written (except for mushrooms). We must like the "Americanized" version of Alfredo - creamy sauce w/more garlic. I used fresh garlic cloves but after putting sauce on pasta, I had to add about 1/4 t. of garlic powder to my plate alone! Everyone ate the meal so I could not give it "one star", but I will never make this recipe "as-is". There are 5 of us in our family, so I'm anxious to see if anyone will choose to eat the left-overs.

Delicious! A little labor intensive with all the chip-chopping, but well worth it. Added frozen peas at the end for a little green and a bit of veggie.

Crazy good! Sauce is rich and lovely creamy! It's rich but not where you have that heavy feel afterwards. Next time I will add a bit more garlic because we like it. But I wanted to go with what the recipe called for first, to see what needs adjustment. I didn't have fettuccini so used what I had on hand- package of cheese tortellini. Also chose to chop up 4 green onions that needed to be used up, rather than onion. Stayed true to everthing else. Next time I will use regular onion and how that compares with chopped green onion. This recipe is pretty great. We loved it. We had sauce leftover and I hope it's as great tomorrow. This is a keeper and beats any other alfredo I've made or eaten before. Thank you so much for sharing.

Just tried this today and I was not disappointed.  I rarely find recipes that my whole family enjoys, but we all liked this one.  I made the recipe as written except for the salt.  I just couldn't bring myself to put in a tablespoon of salt!  When I make this again I will leave out the tomatoes; they don't seem to go with the sauce.  Last, but not least, be aware that a regular size frying pan will not be big enough if you are doing the whole recipe.  I started with my frying pan, but ultimately had to change over to my wok so it wouldn't spill over.  Happy eating.

This recipe was really easy to make. I made it for the first time for my dinner date and he loved it!!! I will definitely be making this recipe again. I followed the recipe exactly as instructed. It came out a little thick so I added extra milk at the end to loosen up the sauce a bit.

Yummy! I'm not a novice cook, however, I am not a "gourmand" either. I was curious to push the boundaries of my menus. The recipe was, quick, easy and delicious. I made no substitutions, followed the recipe carefully (at least as carefully as you can with 6 year old twins "helping"   ;-)) and it was wonderful I WILL be making this again!

We loved it, but it's a little unfair of me to say so as I had to make a couple major changes due to not having milk or sour cream I did everything else, but used chicken broth in place of milk, and Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  I also had some fresh spinach leaves and tossed those in.  

I always tweak the spices, so along with what was called for, I added ground sage, dried ground mustard, and paprika

Made this tonight exactly as written. The sauce was a little runny but soon firmed up as it cooled. It rivals any restaurant alfredo and the tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms added a fresh taste. It was great and I will make again!

Very Good!  Prep is the key.  Get everything cut, diced, weighed and measured before you start cooking.  You'll never get anything this good out of a jar.  We cut it in half and could have easily served six.

Very good recipe. I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used cream cheese -- yummy. I added less chicken and doubled the sauce. The first time I made it I thought there was way to much sauce (it saw more soup-like) and we like the pasta to be the centerpiece.

I have been looking for a good fettuccini alfredo recipe for a long time.  After reading the positive reviews on this recipe I thought I'd give it a try.  It was absolutely the best alfredo I've ever eaten!  My family gave rave reviews and my daughter has requested it for her birthday dinner!  Thank you, Emily!  You rock!!!

The recipe was okay, my family really liked it. It didn't have a lot of flavor, so I added fresh spinach, crushed red pepper, and mozzarella cheese. I agree with other reviewers, it did make excellent leftovers.

I made this dish serving size 4; Instead of just using 2tbs of butter I used Land O' Lakes Saute Express Italian blend with garlic that's already cut up ready to go, along with a little extra Italian seasoning, maybe 1/2 a tablespoon more with the chicken. For the sause I used lemon pepper instead of white pepper and Sargento's Artisan blend Mexican cheese for quesadillas instead of Colby-Monterey Jack cheese. Turned out great, will make again sometime.

This was a hit tonight.  I almost didn't make it after reading a post about "grainy, lumpy sauce".   Granted, there is a trick to making dairy products behave under heat, but I had no trouble.   Let the roux cook the full two minutes (to reduce the grainy texture that comes with a flour-based sauces) and then let it cool a bit.   Whisk in the milk and SLOWLY heat.  Then remove from the heat and whisk in the cheeses and sour cream.  It will not be as satiny smooth as some Alfredo sauces because of the flour, but I didn't find that to be a problem.  I also suggest chopping the tomatoes ahead of time and letting them drain really well before folding into the final dish.  

This dish looks complicated at first, but it comes together really quickly if you do the prep work ahead of time.   I did the chicken first while the pasta water was heating.  The timing of the sauce was perfect with cooking the pasta. Only change I made was to leave out the mushrooms.  I also added the garlic a bit later in the cooking process to avoid overcooking it.  I made a half recipe for our family of 4 and it was more than plenty.  Served with french bread and steamed broccoli.   I'll make this again for sure!

Omg! Omg! I so wish that I could give this more stars! This is one of my new favorite Italian dishes! My family loved it! Well worth all the prep. The only things I changed on the recipe was the tomatoes. We aren't big tomatoes eaters. I also added steamed broccoli florets! I will definitely be making this again. Also, there wasnt a ton of sauce as compared to the noodles like stated in other reviews. We had equal proportions of both.

Everything went well because it taste really good. Yes it was easy to follow the ingredients. The final product looked good to. Also we didn't have to add any different ingredient.

I LOVE this recipe! I really don't know what people did wrong to say it was disgusting or whatever (but obviously the 5 star ratings far outweigh all the other ratings), it is AMAZING! I've made it many times and everyone that's had it RAVES about it! I have never reviewed a recipe before but I figure with how many times I've made it and how universally it's loved, I should! It does take time to prepare and you can definitely make more than 1lb of pasta to go with it, but it's worth it!

This was a very very tasty dish!  The alfredo sauce is thick and really cheesy.  I added salt and pepper to the chicken breasts while they were cooking.  I also decreased the amount of milk from 3 cups to 2 cups, and I only used 1 tomato instead of 3.
I will be making this again!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This recipe was excellent. I have tried other alfredo recipes before and they would come out quite bland however this recipe was spot on! I wouldn't change a thing!

This was good but did not taste like fettucini alfredo.  More like a casserole sauce or something.

I came home with the ingredients for this recipe and realized... I've made this before and gave it 1 star. I still don't know what I'm doing wrong, as I am a very good cook. But I have been to many excellent Italian restaurants ans this recipe isn't fit to feed to the dogs. Terrible.

I typically don't write reviews, but I feel like I need to get Emily's address so I can invite her to my wedding.  I decided to make this for a guy I've been dating (first time cooking for him) and after he tasted it, I'm pretty sure he's ready to buy the ring.  It was delicious!  I only did half of the recipe and there were plenty of leftovers so my roommates were happy as well! Great dish!

OMG, this turned out to be thee very best fettuccini Alfredo I've ever had... and I've got a few dinner guests who will confir. Just a few things I did differently... I left out the Italian seasoning, the sour cream, and instead of using half-and-half... I used 1 pint of heavy cream. I also grated 3/4 cups Romano cheese and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and left the Colby Monterey Jack cheese out. Had I followed the recipe to a T, I would've rated it a 5. Hats off to Emily, I am very pleased with this dish!

We found that it smelled very good while cooking and it got us all very excited.  However, the taste is extremely bland and the texture is awful and grainy.  Very disappointed.

I have made this recipe quite a few times now. The first few time I made it as directed and it was amazing. This last time i added some red bell pepper strips and I think it added a nice freshness to the dish. I sauteed them with the mushrooms and onions. I am usually just cooking for myself, my husband and our 1 year old daughter, so I always cut the recipe in half. It still makes enough to feed at least 5 adults with healthy appetites, this reducing the actual calories listed on the page. Enjoy this meal and definitely improvise what veggies you add to the dish!

This is an amazing recipe. I loved it and my family did too. I added spinach and broccoli for a bit more green and used angle hair pasta since I was out of fettuccine. Turned out great though and I can't wait to make it again.

This was wonderful.  I made it last night and my son who loves to order this when we go out to an Italian restaurant said it was better than any we get out to eat.  I did omit the muschrooms. I can't wait to make it again.

This is amazing! Just a few changes though: omit the half-and-half and the mushrooms. Use black pepper instead of white. A little time consuming but worth it.

Tried it last night, very good but did alter a bit.  Used a cloce of fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and cooked pasta less time and then added it to the sauce to finish.  Think the noodles absorb the flavor more with this method

This was really great and I liked the fact that the sauce is made from scratch. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I added carrots and broccoli, without them I think it would have been a bit bland.

Very delicious! Only used half of the chicken and did not use the mushrooms, tomatoes, or sour cream. Added some extra flour to thicken the sauce.

It's very rich and creamy but so so good. My husband (picky) loved it. I also made it for dinner guest and it was a hit! Great with garlic toast!!

Even if all you do is follow step one and make the chicken as directed, you'll love this recipe. I don't know why it never occurred to me to cook chicken this way, but it was fantastic. The sauce was good too. I'm not going to say it was the absolute best alfredo sauce I've had, but it was good. We had lots of sauce left over, which I like, because I can keep it in the fridge and just boil any kind of noodle and stir it in for a quick lunch option.

We used a seasoned rotisserie chicken omitted the seasoning. That saved a bunch of time. Then we added pepper apple wood  bacon to garnish. It was delish.

This was delicious! A good comfort food. I skipped the tomatoes, but did everything else to the recipe (except white pepper? Just used regular pepper.) Made a lot of sauce! Will probably have to make more noodles to use up the sauce. Both my man and I enjoyed this (yes, a lot of food for two people!) MmmmMmmm! And bonus, the house smells awesome!

One of the BEST recipes I've ever tried and my family raved over it! Husband said it was better than Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo at one of the most popular Italian restaurantes. Will definitely be making this again. Thankyou for sharing it.

I don't usually write reviews but this Dish was the best I ever made, my husband is so picky with food and he gave it a ten. I made some changes I used broccoli instead of mushroom, I also used heavy cream instead of half & half and cheddar instead of Colby jack cheese.. Came out very rich better than any restaurant!

I tried this because of thr rating and could barely get my family to eat it. I followed directions exactly except omitted mushrooms because we dont like them. This was super bland and a very thick sauce, i had to add more cream butter mixture to thin it out and ended up putting cayenne pepper in the leftovers to give it a taste. My husband preferred pizza take out vs. Leftovers which is a once in a 12 yr marriage occurence! I will stick to my old recipe just butter,heavy cream, salt,pepper and parm, light and tasty.

This is the best!!!! I love the fettuccini from Olive Garden BUT this is better! I made a few changes because my teenager doesnt like a strong garlic flavor, so I used only 1 garlic clove and about 1/4 of an onion. Also I didnt have italian seasoning so I used about 1/2 Tablespoon of dry Italian dressing mix. I really wasnt sure what that was going to do, but we really enjoyed the taste. The rest was followed exactly and it is sooooo good. This deserves 10 stars!!!!

This recipe was fantastic! I didn't know that making homemade Alfredo was so easy! I did opt for Romano cheese in place for the colby-jack though. I might use a little less onion next time, as it had a really strong onion flavor as left overs.

This was really easy and very tasty.  I wouldn't do it often - not exactly diet friendly, but it's really good - and worth the occasional splurge in calories!  Followed the recipe exactly, and we loved it.  Thanks!

My husband's favorite food is Chicken Alfredo, and we'll drive an hour to go a certain restaurant and he swears this recipe is the best he's ever had! I only make it when I need to butter him up and it works every time! I've convinced him that it's super hard to make which is why I can't make it often. A little white lie never hurt anyone. ;)

This was good and hubby thought I bought the alfredo sauce, so kudos to Emily!  I, of course, having the ghetto kitchen that I do, had to make substitutions since I didn't have all the incredients.  First, since there are only 2 of us eating, I used only one BIG chicken breast, then thirded (is that a word?) the remaining ingredients.  I didn't have half-n-half so I used Lite Ranch Dressing and nix'd the sour cream.  Had to use 2 cheese sticks, too, instead of the CMJ cheese (it was a white/yellow mix so I think I was close).  I did make the recipe as instructed and, like I said, it came out all right.  Thanks for sharing :-)

the first time i made this,  i thought it was a bit heavy on the parmesan so i cut it down to 2-3 tbsp. to cut the fat, i substituted an equal amount of evaporated milk. also substituted steamed broccoli and carrots for the veggies. lastly for cheeses, i split it between medium cheddar and colby jack. by far, the best alfredo i have ever made or ate. has become a family favorite.

Delicious recipe!!! I substituted broccoli for the mushrooms and halved the recipe. Very creamy! The only regret I had was that instead of 1/2 lb of noodles I made a whole lb which ended up scucking up most of the sauce and drying out the entire dish a bit. Next time I'll go by what it says.

This is an excellent dish!  But, if you need to double the recipe, be prepared to spend 2 hours in the kitchen.

Really, really good.  I think reviewers who ended up with grainy sauce may have not done enough stirring, added the cheese/milk slowly enough, and/or used too high a heat setting.  I had to use a shredded 4-cheese mexican blend, garlic powder and penne pasta, but it still turned out fabulously. I also added (gulp) 12 strips of crumbled bacon.  I should have looked at the "servings" field though..... for a family of three, this made dinner, lunch for the week, and a midnight snack : )

I've never made Chicken Alfredo before but think its fair to say that this recipe definitely puts olive gardens Alfredo to shame ha ha the only things I did differently: used canned milk instead of regular milk and added pepper jack instead of Colby, I loved it and will definitely be making this again.

I used three large chicken breast and it was plenty of chicken, I didn't have sour cream or the Monterey Jack cheese, so I used all Parmesan cheese, I actually followed the Quick Alfredo sauce recipe on this website for the sauce. I didn't add tomatoes, but did use Portabella mushrooms and some green onion. I'll try it again when I have the correct ingredients for the sauce, never had Alfredo sauce with Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream before.

This was rich and filling!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  Believe it or not I did not have any milk!  So, I used 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy cream.  Next time I will use the milk because it won't make it so heavy.  I also didn't have colby monterey so I used mozzarella.  I omitted the tomatoes and the sour cream.  I will definitley make this again!

I added broccoli & fresh chopped mushrooms in place of the packaged mushrooms & it was delicious. I especially like that it is a little less heavy than recipes that call for heavy cream, but still has a lot of flavor. Will be making this again, yum yum!

I tried this recipe, just like it is called for, but we didn't like it at all.  The sauce isn't cheesy enough and has a grainy texture.

This is sooo good I make it about once or twice a month its a great Sunday dinner for after church you can make it the night before and put it in the oven as soon as you get home long enough for it to warm up. I also make it with shrimp to change things up a bit. I cook the shrimp in red cooking wine its fantastic! You must try this recipe:)

This was the first meal I ever made for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. Now whenever I ask what he wants for his birthday or Christmas this is on his list. :) The only thing I changed was I added some broccoli and sauteed it with the mushrooms. I am making this is my new holiday recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter.  This was a decent, adequate meal, but kind of a lot of steps and not outstanding enough to go through all of them again.  My family liked it, and even ate the leftovers out of the fridge.  But no one has mentioned it since, and they would, if it were a 5 star recipe.

I normally never review recipes but wowieee, was this fantastic or what! Restaurant quality, infact even better! I did cut down the half-and-half to 1/2 cup and used corn instead of mushrooms. I also used cheddar cheese and it was incredibly creamy and cheesy. Will definitly make again!

I just made this for my boyfriend and his roomates-- they (and I) LOVED it. I'm always looking for the best alfredo and this wins by far. I did change it a little by using farfalle instead of fettuccini, substituting half and half with heavy cream, and cutting out the sour cream. FANTASTIC. Three college boys and I ate it and we still have about half leftover. Next time I will cut it in half.

My sauce turned out a little runny and bland, despite following directions closely. I added a 1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles, which added some nice flavor.

I am a very seasoned cook and there is not much I cannot make.  For all the ingredients and layers of flavor there should have been in this recipe it was tasteless.  The texture of the sauce was grainy.  This is one I will not make again.

I loved how easy this was! I was not convinced that it would work out so well, sounded too easy! I did use garlic instead and angle hair pasta because it was what I had...delicious! I think I've made it three times in the last month!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Everytime I've made it I get rave reviews. People will take a bite and sit there for a minute in silence with their eyes closed, then they tell me how wonderful it is. In my opinion, you can never have enough cheese, so I thought all the cheese requirements were perfect.

One comment.  Take the onions and muchrooms out of the butter once they have cooked.  Whisk in flour only and cook 2 minutes.  Add salt and pepper and stir in milk and cream until slightly thickened.  THEN add in the onions and mushrooms with the chicken.

I thought the flavor was very good, and it was very easy to make.  So, based on that I would have given it 5 stars.  But, the sauce seemed to make alot more then what was needed for the noodles, and it was also SUPER THICK.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but it was almost clumpy when dishing it out it was so thick.  I should have taken more time to read the other reviews to see how others handled this.  But, based on just the recipe itself, it seemed a little too thick. I think it would be a great recipe though if I thinned it out a bit.

I took a pound of cooled shrimp, to replace the chicken......If you will carefully add a smidge of cayanne pepper for just a little "bite"....Chop about 10 stuffed olives to add........ Folks, THIS IS WONDERFUL.........Serve with crusty bread, and a micro green salad......I buy a dressing from a resturant I have been going to for over 50 years......Definate garlic base...... Good luck...........Thanks to the originator. Daniel

This was a really rich and delicious dish. I only used half the onion and half the mushrooms. I used heavy cream instead of half and half and 2% milk which is all I had. I only had a cheddar-colby jack blend and ran out so I tossed in some grated romano to make up the difference. I left the tomatoes out as my husband doesn't like tomatoes with meat. I only used a tsp of salt. Everyone enjoyed this dish and although it was a bit of work and took a while, it was really great and I will serve this again.

My Italian-loving boyfriend thought this dish was good, but we made quite a few notes to improve upon the next time we make it.  I made the full recipe and it did indeed make a lot of food - but it's perfect for putting in the freezer!  Recommendations for next time: -1/3c flour is way too much. The flour was chunky regardless of how much I stirred it. Next time I'm going to start with 1/6c and add more if needed. -More half & half, I'd say almost 2c. -1/2c onion (to be more specific) -a little less Parmesan cheese

This is the first homemade recipe Ive ever attempted (with my husbands help).  It was sooo good!  Creamy cheesy deliciously filling dish.  I halfed the recipe, and didn't use ground white pepper, just a little regular black pepper.  It was more than enough for my husband and I, even my picky toddler ate it!  We had a lot leftover.  A perfect pasta dish, I plan on making again and again.

This is a delicious meal comprised of rich ingredients such as butter and cream, which make it a wonderful, delicious dish that include fresh tastes (like the Roma tomatoes) that complement the rich Alfredo taste.

I was a little disappointed in this one.  I love alfredo so I made this recipe for New Years' Eve.  It was pretty good, but there was definitely something missing.  I think maybe it needed more spice.

Very Good!  Thanks for sharing.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used low fat milk, half/half, and cheese.  Very creamy and delicious!  Next time we are going to try it with shrimp unstead of chicken.

I really liked this recipe, definitely one of the best alfredos I have ever had.  My family thought it was a bit bland, so I will tweak the recipe next time I fix it.

This recipe was great! I followed it exactly, except I used minced garlic instead of the fresh gloves.  I agree with the others who suggested to have everything measured out ahead of time! I am a beginner in the kitchen and this was an easy recipe to make. I was very impressed...I will for sure make this again!!

This was so easy and turned out perfect. My husband and kids are still talking about how great this meal was. I did use double the chicken because there where 9 of us and did'nt increase the sauce and it was just right for all of us.

Very good!  I agree that it's not a traditional alfredo sauce, but with a taste this good, who cares?  I used whole wheat flour and whole wheat pasta, and it still turned out great.  I also cut down on the butter by more than a tablespoon and it still turned out just fine.  I think that the butter portions are a bit high.

Wonderful! Next time I will be adding broccoli. If you don't have half and half, then you can easily make it. 3/4 whole milk and 1/4 heavy cream.

YUMMO- this was a wonderful dish. My husband and I loved it. We had it with spinach spaghetti which I think made the colors really beautiful. I also left out the sour cream because I had none- and it was still perfect. We are vegetarian so we used fake chicken breast cooked and then cut into chunks. So delicious, will be a favorite for years to come.

As suggested by others, DO NOT CHANGE A THING!  My boyfriend almost licked his plate!  He did ask me for the cayenne pepper to sprinkle on the top so next time I will add a dash of red pepper flakes for a kick since he prefers everything spicy.  Other than that, this is a true recipe.  I cut everything in half since there are only two of us and it was amazing.

Excellent recipe. I used chicken thighs, extra mushrooms, and left out the tomato. The sauce served over fettuccini is cuisine-worthy, something I would order while eating out. I heartily dislike pre-made alfredo sauces, but this recipe is just wonderful--very creamy and flavorful. Will make this again.

It was okay, but not a recipe I will repeat.  I made the mistake of creating the full recipe amount and it actually serves 16?  20?  It makes a TON of food, and is so rich.  I ended up plucking out the chicken, and re-purposing it into a chicken and wild mushroom soup.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I am planning to serve this at my sisters shower, so I decided to try this recipe and it is actually pretty easy.  The longest part was getting all the ingredients together.  I did however use Italian Cheese mix in place of the parmesean cheese, my grocery store didn't have any.

I didn't like it much.. I followed the instructions exactly.. I'm looking for one that tastes like the ones they serve at Olive Garden... BUT my boyfriend DID like it.. so I guess some of us are more picky than others.

Excellent recipe. Before adding the dairy ingredients, I poured in a 14 oz can of chicken broth and let the liquid cook down so the chicken would be extra tender. I didn't have pepper jack, so I substituted a 6 cheese Italian blend. I didn't have half an half or sour cream, so I cut in an 8 oz package of cream cheese. This made the sauce quite thick, so i decided to use it in between lasagna noodles. I'm sure the recipe is even better as written. Even my picky 5 year old had 2 big servings. This does make a lot of sauce.

Yum!! Great for a dinner party. It's not difficult to make and our guests were really impressed. We cut out the mushrooms and tomato and it was still fabulous served with some garlic bread. It could easily serve 8-10 people because it's so heavy that people don't go back for seconds :)

This is a well seasoned Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo recipe. I really liked it but I didn't love it. When I wanted to have it again I went with the Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccini Noodles recipe. I felt bad for liking something less fancy, especially because there is absolutely nothing wrong with the recipe, it really is great and it deserves 5 stars.

The only problem with this recipe is that my husband - and his brother - will not eat any other Fettuccini Alfredo now that they've had this. It has raised the bar significantly! It's probably the best Fettuccini Alfredo I've ever had!

I followed the recipe to the letter but somehow the alfredo sauce was "gritty" don't know what went wrong, I've made lots of sauces and never had that happen.  Didn't think the flavor was that great. I won't make this again.

This recipe is soo good. My whole family loved it. I used the jarred minced garlic and it was really good! Be sure to use fresh mushrooms if you can. They are so much better than the canned rubbery ones!

I didn't change a single thing on this recipe.  My sons who are grown BOTH ate large helpings of it and asked me if they could save the leftovers.  This was a tremendous compliment to the recipe! I served it over whole wheat noodles and found it to be a very satisfactory dish.  We will keep this in our stack of favorite recipes!  Thank you!

This is the first review I have ever given, motivated by this perfect chicken dish! I followed the recipe exactly and it was worth the effort. My teenage son and his two friends just couldn't get enough and the recipe will go into the family favorites category. I don't typically like to repeat recipes as there are so many to try, but this is a keeper --thank you!

WOW!!! This was absolutely wonderful! As another reviewers husband said, "Beats Olive Garden!" I forgot to add the tomatoes at the end, but everything else I followed exactly, and I usually change stuff. Glad I didn't this time! It was wonderful just like this!

Amazing!  Served with shrimp instead of chicken and it was a huge hit!  Just make sure it's extra saucy when you serve it- the pasta sucks it up quickly.

I made the recipe as written except substituting heavy cream for the 1/2 and 1/2 because thats what I had on hand. It was delicious! I made a big mess because this made more than my pan could hold, but I will not hesitate to make this again, maybe just halving the recipe.

A "very good" version of fettucini alfredo probably one of the best recipes I have seen. I didn't give it 5 stars because it did not "wow" me. I will definitely make this again it's a top pick and next time add a splash of white wine to try and get the "wow" factor.

Absolutely fantastic!!!  I have been using this recipe for about a year.  It's my standard "take a meal to someone" recipe.  And almost without exception I am asked for the recipe.  I haven't done it with the mushrooms and tomatoes, but I think they would be good in it too.  I think I do more garlic.  I am surprised some people rated this very low and said it was bland - this is the full flavor alfredo sauce I was looking for!  I've tried other recipes and they taste like a flour/glue paste sauce.  Not this one.  I'm pretty sure you'll love it!

great and easy...more like a stew or casserole with pasta underneath. I would go with 2 pounds of pasta in the future and use the largest skillet possible(sauce almost overflowed) smells great.the best fettucini i have everrr had!
-ilovecooking12321.

ps leave sauce on skillet longer than normal to tighten up before added with pasta.

All I can say is WOW ...this was definetly very rich and tasty.I did not use the mushrooms,The only thing I would say to lessen is the salt it was a bit salty..so Use half of whatever it calls for..I would make this over and over again..my kids loved it and asked for seconds and thirds..thanks

I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing about it.

Extremely tasty.  Next time I'll use a touch less flour and omit the sour cream.
I added cayenne pepper at last minute as I like it a little spicier than written.

OMG this recipe is soooo good.  Creamy without being too cheesy.  My picky family raved about it.  All I added was fresh cooked broccoli and some hot pepper flakes(cuz we like a little kick).Thanks for the recipe..its a keeper!

Very flavourful dish. I did take the advice and cut the recipe in half since i was cooking for only two, and it still was obviously more than enough. Got some nods for making the sauce myself too. Thanks.

I absolutely love this recipe.  At first I wasn't too sure about the colby jack cheese but after making it the first time I knew it was a hit.  I've probably made it about 20 more times.

This was a good recipe. The sauce was very thick and rich so it's probably something I will only make every once in a while. Next time I will use less Italian seasoning...just my own person preference!  Thanks!

This was a fun and easy recipe to make.  I really haven't been able to find a store bought alfredo sauce that I like, so I htought I'd take a chance with this one.  It turned out to be delicious and one that I will definitely make again and again!

This is easy and it's okay.  I thought it tasted an awful lot like Beef Stroganoff but with chicken - probably because of the sour cream.

It may have been my error but I personally did not like the finish product. However, my family disagrees with me. Sauce wasn't thick enough and the taste was just slightly off.

Great Recipe. I subtract the salt to let the cheeses give more flavor. You can use fat-free sour cream and fat-free half and half to reduce fat/calories...they also help thin the sauce.

This was really good. I added too much cheese and flour because the alfredo sauce seemed really thin at first, but when it got thick, it got thick fast and it ended up being too thick. I still really liked it, but my husband thought it would be better a little thinner. Flavor was outstanding. I added broccoli instead of tomatoes, but that was the only real change. YUM!

Yummm!!! It tastes AMAZING. I followed the recipe as closely as I could. Omitted the italian seasoning, mushroom (used olives), tomato, half n half and used mild cheddar instead of Jack-Colby. I don't think it needs salt. The sauce was creamy and delicious. It was a little grainy, but I guess that's cos of my inexperience and not the recipe. Im surely going to try it again... this time with some oregano and spice.

this recipe is very very good, i dont understand why some cooks think that this recipe was blah, because i enjoyed it . and found it very easy, i used all the ingredients that where listed. i halfed the recipe, easy to do on this site with the system they offer. and it was plenty. my changes where, i used perdue already cooked chicken from the frozen section. and i added a cup of parmesian , and a cup of colby , as i love , love cheese. and after i was done with the sauce, i added the chicken and the pasta,and i put all the ingredients together in the same pot. Fabulous. Thank You So Much From Florida

This dish had me skeptical at first, but I followed the recipe, except exchanging the white pepper for black. It was so easy and It was AMAZING!! I have had some pretty crummy alfredo's before so I wasn't sure about trying this. I LOVED IT. It has amazing flavor and feeds a ton of people. Great recipe, I'll definitely be adding this to my classics!

This is my favorite dish, whenever i go out to eat, this is what I usually order. but not anymore! This recipe is better than most restaurants. I made it exactly as written, and I was so surprised, it was absolutely perfect. The best I've ever tasted. Excellent recipe. BTW my hubby hates alfredo sauce, but he actually likes this one.

This chicken alfredo was the best homemade I've had in a long time. Next time I would leave out the onions & mushrooms. The sauce is so good on its own that I don't think it needs it. I will definitely add this to my collection and make it more often!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I omitted tomatoes and mushrooms and OOPS forgot the sour cream.  This was horrible.  I threw out the leftovers as noone liked it.  The betty crocker version is much better!  The recipe cooked up perfectly, but the flavor was just not what I expect in a 5 star recipe.  Will not cook this again.  Im sorry.

This was edible, but not very tasty.  Just creamy and rich without being very flavorful... and I used a lot of seasoning, too.  Won't make this again.

This was great.  I seasoned with more Italian seansoning to taste.  I used fat free half-n-half - just as good.  Had to cook the sauce to my desired thickness and only used 2 cups 1% milk and the full 1 cup half-n-half.  Great.  I did not add the mushrooms or tomatoes.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for my boyfriend last night and we both really enjoyed it. Really creamy and flavorful, but super filling! After reading all the reviews I decided to cut the recipe in half, which still left us with a lot left over. I left out the tomatoes and mushrooms, but next time I might try adding broccoli. Thanks for the recipe!

I pick all my recipes from this website and I analyze the reviews over and over so I am here to tell you, don't bother reading any further. This was great! This is definitely the best alfredo I've ever made. I would expect something like this in a restaurant. Not that hard at all. It does make A LOT of sauce so you'll definitely have leftovers!

This came out really well.  The kids loved it.  I omitted the tomatoes and only used half the onion since the kids don't care for those.  I will probably omit the onion completely next time and use onion powder as a substitute.

Creamy and very tasty. My husband raved about it.  However, I put in a little extra italian seasoning than the recipe called for, and it made the taste a little too strong.  I also put in some extra milk because I worried about having enough, but the milk watered it down a bit.  In sum, I'd stick very closely to the recipe if I made it again.

Family really liked this dish....I also added sliced red and green peppers for more veggies. I also uses a mozz/provolone cheese mix since that was all I had. Very creamy sauce. Nice all in one meal, chicken,veggies,pasta. Served with salad and green beans.

This is the best fettuccini alfredo I have ever had in my life!  I really believe that it is important to follow the recipe exactly as written.  I have made this recipe for family and friends, and it is always a huge success.  There isn't anything I would do different.  It is not only my favorite fettuccini recipe, but my favorite over ANY dish.  I recomend that everyone try it!

I'll rate this a 5, I did change the seasonings as we're having lasagna tomorrow night.  I used creole seasoning instead.  It was pretty good, not nearly as much spice as I'd like because my guys don't like super spicy stuff.

This was a great recipe.  Even when it was left overs it still tasted good.  I think it made an awful lot though, will half it next time.  Very rich taste.  Liked the tomatoes in it.

This was excellent!! Tastes just like it was from a restaurant. I made a couple changes. I used fat free sour cream, milk, half and half, and Smart Butter. I did not add any veggies (kids are picky), did add puree cauliflower. The family did not notice at all! Everyone ate it and my MIL said it was fantastic!! Will make again!

This recipe was a big hit with my family.  My son asked me to make it and I have never made it before until today.  I read the reviews and I also cut the recipe in half.  I also omitted the salt & tomatoes and cut down on the butter a bit.  I also added frozen peas in place of the tomatoes.  It was very rich and creamy and I have to admit has a great flavor!  Will definitely make again!

I made this for my family last night and everyone was crazy about it! My son, who is very picky about his alfredo sauce, said the sauce had the "perfect creaminess".  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this a while ago and it turned out so delicious and creamy! Instead of using the cheese(s) in this recipe, I used swiss and parmesan cheeses. It came out creamy. All my family and friends loved it! It was amazing. I will definitely make it again! ♥ Laila

Good, but not a favorite. I think it needed more garlic - maybe that would make me love it more.

The BEST alfredo sauce!  Make sure to use freshly grated parm cheese and NOT the one in a canister sitting on a shelf!  That is the only thing I can think of as to why people are saying it's "grainy".  I've made this at least a dozen times and it has never turned out grainy. Follow directions and you can't go wrong! I do not put in the tomatoes nor add the sour cream...not needed!

I got to feed 150 hungry Mixed Martial Arts Athletes with this recipe. Being that this is a bar they were expecting fried food, well I surprised them with this dish and it was a hit! I was able to individually pack the rest up and added it to our menu for the next day. This dish is truly the best one so far. Esther Patterson

Very good. But I would recommend using less salt if you are sensitive. It was just a touch too salty for me. It's true the sauce does not taste like the traditional alfredo we're used to, but it's still good in its own right.

My son requested Chicken Fettucini Alfredo because his girlfriend had made it for him and he loved it. I had never made it before because of fat content etc (and  honestly didn't think my family would like it since they are meat and potato people) but it is well worth all the fat and calories!!!  I have never tasted a better recipe...it was easy to make and I will definitely make it again and watch what I eat the next day...totally worth the indulging!!!  In fact, I had friends stop by while I was making it and they said it  smelled wonderful so I'm having them back for dinner and you know what I'm making!

We loved this.  I only made the Fettuccini part because I made it with stuffed pork chops.  But I plan on making the whole meal very soon!  I would of liked it to be a little more creamy.. It was very thick because of the cheese, but the taste was awesome!

This turned out to be a great recipe! I felt like a top star chef. My picky kids even liked it. The only thing I will change next time is use a little less half & half and add about 1/3 cup of my leftover chicken broth. I've always felt, even for restaurant fettuccini, that it is too thick and stick to your ribs kind of meal. Thank you so much!

OK, but I was disappointed--too much cheese--Monterey Jack?--and meat, I wouldn't consider it a traditional alfredo recipe.

My 18 year old son made this recipe today for our family and his girlfriend.  Over all I think it was very good, my son did however find the instructions confusing, if it weren't for me he would have added more spices than the recipe called for.  The amounts in the instructions didn't work with the amount in the recipe when we printed it out.  We didn't add the mushrooms because his girlfriend doesn't like them, and we didn't add the tomatoes because we haven't had chicken fettuccine with tomatoes in it before.  We didn't use the tablespoon of salt called for in the recipe I thought it would end up too salty instead we just salted to taste.  The recipe turned out very good and my son was able to impress his girlfriend with his cooking skills. Thanks for sharing this recipe

Absolutely scrumptious!  I followed the recipe as written - except that I left out the tomato.  I couldn't believe how easy this was to make and how incredible it smelled while cooking.  I served it over spinach fettuccini noodles and topped it with some steamed,chopped broccoli - it looked nice,added a few more vitamins,and tasted great together.  We are a family of 5 and cut this recipe in half and still had a good amount of leftovers.

This recipe is AWESOME!! My entire family LOVED it, including my picky eater! My husband couldn't get enough and has requested I make it once a week until he gets tired of it!!  :o) I'm not a big 'white sauce' lover, but this recipe has changed that forever!! Delicious!!

I made this last night for dinner and it was great - I grilled the chicken, sliced it, and layed it on top of the finished pasta - I used mozzarella cheese instead of the colby-jack cheese because its what I had - and I forgot to stir in the sour cream.  It was great - it makes a big pan of pasta though, so be ready to eat!

I would give this 10 stars if I could! This was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I left out the mushrooms because I am the only one who will eat them and it was still the best I have ever made. Much better than any fettucine alfredo I have had in an expensive italian restaurant. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I doubled this and brought it for a teacher appreciation meal.  I did not cook the noodles all the way and then threw it all together in a crock pot on low a little bit before serving it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I love the tomatoes, it added a nice color.

the dish came out very tasty! Just to note, I cut the recipe in half. And since my parents are trying to cut back on their sodium intake, where ever butter was used I used half butter-half olive oil. I also used 1/2 tsp less salt and it still turned out a bit too salty for me! All in all the recipe is very nice.

HOLY COW!  This recipe made my husband ooh and ahh and say such things as "You are the most wonderful wife in the world!" and "How did you do it?!" We left out the mushrooms, but did everything else as the recipe instructed.  Ten million times better than store bought and just as good as a fancy restaurant!  It's in my recipe box PERMANENTLY! :)

This recipe is Very good but with everything that's put into it, it's definantly a once in a while meal with the amount of fat and calories that are in it.  We served w/ garlic bread.

LOVED this!  I added one cup more milk, doubled the garlic and added crushed red pepper - changes I made simply because of our taste.  Yummy!  I froze half of the sauce with some chicken, served up the other half with a pound of fetticini - we still have leftovers.  Basicall will make four good meals for our family of five.  Best I've ever had.

I rated this a five, because I felt the flavor was outstanding...I followed the recipe exactly except I put in less salt (I tend to do that especially with sauces, since I hate it when things are too salty and I can always add more)  However, my sauce was way to thick to even really spoon over the fettucine, so I added extra milk to the mix (it still turned out quite thick).  I think maybe next time I'd put in less flour since we like a medium thickness to our sauces.  And I think I may try some other Italian cheeses next time as well.  Excellent flavor, though, my husband loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

I LOVE this Recipe.  The alfredo sauce is delicious.  This has ruined all other fettuccini alfredos for me.  Nothing else can compare.  I've tried the can stuff and mixes...Never again.  I even stopped ordering this in restaurants because it never tastes as good as this recipe. It tastes really good with sweet peas added in.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I didn't have alot of chicken, but I added 2 cups of brocolli.  I didn't have enough mushrooms and tomatoes, but it turned out just fine anyway.  I cooked the onions for 10 minutes instead of 2 and created a Rue.  The sauce is so good.  I needed a larger pan, and used rotini instead.  What a delicious recipe!  Will definitely try it again and again!

Fantastic! Had even my health conscience friends fighting for seconds. It even worked well with what I had on hand. I used romano, cheddar and munster cheese as substitutes. I did find it too salty and that the sour cream wasn't really necessary. I suggest adding these to taste only. The last time I made it, I added chopped ham and peas instead of chicken. That was a hit too! (I fried the ham with the onions and mushrooms and added the peas just before serving). Quick, easy and yummy!

I was also somewhat intimidated by the recipe having never made an Alfredo from scratch.  It turned out magnificent!!!  Patience is needed when stirring in the milk and cream, but it does become creamy.  Yes, lots of sauce but the recipe was for 8 afterall.  Plan to experiment in the future.  Broccoli sounds good, shrimp maybe, the mushrooms were wonderful!!!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit. I amended the recipe somewhat, used skim milk, light flora instead of butter and only used about half of what the recipe called for, omitted the half-and-half and the tomatoes. I also only used one clove of garlic, one teaspoon of salt and I used black pepper based on previous opinions.
Portions are large, but it tastes so good there isn’t any left anyway!
Thanks!

This is a very tasty and easy recipe.  I did add extra chicken because we are meat lovers.  A doubled to recipe with the expectation of leftovers -- my family ate it all in one sitting.

Excellent dish and so easy.  To cut the fat, I subbed 2 cans of chicken broth for the milk and half and half.  I used freshly grated parm and some mozzarella as thats what I had.  Didn't use the tomatoes.  I had to cook more pasta to feed all my men, but there was plenty of sauce.  Will try as written for company.

This is fabulous!  I made it for our family's Sunday dinner and everyone raved about it.  I used freshly-grated Parmesan cheese . . . a delicous dish that will make frequent repeat appearances on our table.  It's a bit rich and calorie/fat/carb laden for everyday, but a wonderful splurge every now and then--definitely worth the indulgence!

I thought this recipe was wonderful! I made this last week when we had company over and everyone loved it, even my husband!  The only changes I made were using plain lowfat yogurt in place of sour cream and using minced garlic instead of taking the time to chop up fresh garlic. Next time I will half the recipe as it made tons!

Having never made an alfredo sauce before, I was a bit leary.  This turned out fairly well but the extra punch that others described wasn't my favorite.  I would also cut down on the amount of garlic as it's very strong in the given amounts.

This recipe was easy to make. I used angel hair pasta instead of fettuccini.  It was very good.

This was the most wonderful recipe I've tasted!  My husband made it for my birthday dinner, and it was awesome!  I've already passed the word on to my mom to check this recipe out.  Very delicious, you'll have no regrets when you try it!

This was sooo good!  I did have a pregnant woman blunder though. after all was said and done and everyone had eaten i realized that i had used marjoram instead of white pepper...!? anyways. it didn't seem to make any difference but i will know better next time i make it. atleast both marjoram and white pepepr are relatively calm spices.

I made this recipe exactly and it came out terrible... wouldn’t make again. Not your typical Chicken Alfredo, I didn’t get adding the different cheeses but thought would try it. Very disappointed.

This recipe is soooooo creamy. It makes a LOT more than I expected so perfect for cooking for a group. I added bell peppers and some broccoli so I didn't have to feel quite so bad about the amount of fat, and it added a lot of color and texture. 

I had read reviews about there being too much liquid in the sauce so I only used 2 cups of milk and halved the sour cream. I also added more parmesan because I like the more bitter flavor. If I were to make it again, double the salt, and lessen the Italian seasoning (I used a very strong seasoning from France that ended up overshadowing the cheesy flavor a little).

I made some changes (using what I had on hand). I used rotisserie chicken which was already cooked. I poured the contents of step 1 over the chicken I had set aside. Since I had no half n half, I used 3 cups of 2% milk it came out thick and creamy but will get the half n half next time. I added broccoli with the tomatoes and that is when I put the chicken in to heat it up. It was colorful, thick and tasty.

great recipe! I ended up customizing the amount of some of the ingredients and used black pepper instead of white. also, instead of the mushrooms and tomatoes, I used broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. still tasted great with everyone asking for seconds!

My family and i thought this recipe was very good. i didn't add mushrooms because they don't like them, so i substituted a chopped red pepper instead. The recipe made a lot, and we had plenty of leftovers. i will definately make this again. it had more flavor then some restaurants. Very good.

my hubby and kids LOVED this recipe. only thing I did different was I added in broccoli and asparagus, and a tad more milk and cream to make it a bit less thick. besides that awesome recipe, will def be adding this to my collection of recipes.

I only made a third of this recipe, and it was plenty for one of those smaller packages of “ fresh” fettuccini. The recipe was very forgiving (I missed the part where you cook the flour after your add it, and used the jack and cheddar I had on hand instead of a Colby jack mix).

I made it according to the recipe. The sauce was too thick and there was just too much cheese. Next time I will use half the cheese.

My family pretty much loved this recipe - including my picky daughter - even though I had to leave out the Colby cheese (none in the house).  The only thing we will change going forward is omitting the sour cream - just because it wasn't to our taste.

Very rich and delicious sauce. I tried to use low fat ingredients to make it less heavy, like whole wheat pasta and low fat butter and fresh cream. The taste was so amazing..

I just added broccoli to the noodles about 4 min in and added everything to my big pot! My husband LOVED it. Made me feel like cooking is something not so far from reach!

Left out a few things, like mushrooms and the jack cheese and halved the recipe. Consistency was good but it was lacking flavor. It was very bland in flavor, maybe the second cheese makes more of a difference than I thought?

Yummy! This is a favourite especially with fresh tomatoes, basil and oregano from the garden. Skipped the chicken for the vegetarians.

I made it and did it with a twist. I took the juice from the chicken and placed it in a pot and made the alfredo sauce without sauteeing the veggies - just skip that step and do the flour and butter and salt step. Then since my hubby likes mushrooms and onions;  I poured the sauce over and mixed in the chicken with the sauteed mushrooms and onions.  For me, I took the remainder of the sauce and added steamed broccoli and tomatoes to it with the other half of the chicken.  1 recipe 2 dishes lasted 3 days. That's a winner!!

I made this as written omitting the tomatoes and mushrooms only cuz my family preferred it without. I on the other hand would have liked to have tried it with them. A 4 star review from my tough critics is darn good!!! I do agree that the recipe could use more chicken as it does make a lot of sauce. We liked it a lot and I will definitely be making it again!

I think the sauce taste amazing! I used more pasta though to make make it less runny. Also, my fiancé doesn’t like tomatoes or mushrooms (bummer), so I did corn and peas instead!

Loved it and it was so easy.   I didn't have any mushrooms in the house nor fresh tomatoes but it was still really good without them.   Next time I'll plan ahead and will include them.  My husband who doesn't like Parmesan cheese thought it was delicious.   I think the addition of the Colby/jack cheese made a big difference by giving it a cheesy flavor without it just being Parmesan flavor.

I was excited to try this recipe - with an overall rating of over 4 stars, with over 1,000 reviews I thought it must be fantastic.  My teenage-son, who eats everything and has never met an alfredo sauce he doesn't like, barely touched it.  
I personally think it has potential - but there are changes I'd make for next time.
1.  I don't understand the use of Colby/jack cheese in it - it made the sauce yellowish instead of white and the flavor just isn't what you'd expect.  
2.  the quantity of cheese is way too much - makes this more of a cheese sauce rather than alfredo.  Next time, I'd use about half the amount asked for.
3.  I was ok with tomatoes, but suggest tossing them in at the end, and make sure you use roma - I didn't have roma, only had garden tomatoes.  They broke down in the sauce.  I was ok with this from a flavor perspective, but they ended up becoming part of the sauce rather than pieces of tomatoes.  Also, taken together with the yellow cheese, gave the sauce overall an orange flavor.  
4.  The quantity - this makes a ridiculous amount of sauce.  Seriously - there were 6 of us, two being teenage boys, and we have enough leftovers for 2-3 more meals.  Next time, I will half this recipe.

The recipe turned out great! I pretty much followed the recipe but added about half a cup more of Parmesan to make the Alfredo a little thicker (keep in mind it does get thicker once it's cool which was perfect for my family). Overall tasted great, my husband who hated Fettuccini Alfredo even asked for seconds!

This has great flavor...  I wanted to experiment with spaghetti squash, so I found this recipe and used spaghetti squash instead of fettuccine noodles.  Baked the spaghetti squash and at the end, stirred it into the finished sauce.   We are low salt so I did not add the salt.  I did use the Italian seasoning and thought it gave plenty of flavor.  There was a lot of sauce!  Next time I think I will reduce the total volume of milk, half-and-half by a quarter and try that.  The recipe just states 4-6 chicken breasts and I used 1 lb.  Next time, I will use 1 1/2 lb.  Not a true Alfredo taste with the co-jack but I didn't expect it to be.  I didn't have any issues with the consistency, but I make roux's all the time.  Definitely delicious!

Next time I will omit the flour- made it too pasty like. I added some jar alfredo sauce to try to save it.  It came out okay.

I halved the recipe.  It fed three twice.  Forgot to add the grated Parmesan... and it was still the best I've ever eaten!  Have already shared the recipe and am planning to make it again soon.  Short cut:  used 8 oz. fajita chicken instead of cooking my own.  Worked fine.  Have discovered that I can trust Allrecipes site for any recipe.  Always check here first... Thank you!!!

Turned out great!!! We love cheese so I added about a half cup more of Parmesan than called for and I used some homemade roasted garlic. Delicious!!! My daughter said she wants it for dinner again tomorrow. I've made fettuccini Alfredo hundreds of times over the years, but not like this. I think I'll tweet it a bit more for the next time, but overall we are satisfied! (Baked asparagus goes great with this!)

Absolutely great recipe! The souse is a dynamite.  Fettuccine amount suggested in recipe will feed 5 adults, not 8. The souse amount is good for 8 persons for sure. The cooking time of 1 hour is about right for one cook. Two can do it within 30 minutes.

This dish wasn't hard at all! I used store bought Alfredo sauce instead of making it from scratch, so that saved some time. I also ignored all the measurements since, 1. I didn't have time for that and 2. It seemed a little too much for one pound of fettuccine. I also suggest after sauteing the chicken and onions fully, to add in the Alfredo sauce, then once the sauce is somewhat cooked, mix in the cooked fettuccine. The only seasonings I used were cayenne pepper for a spicy kick, and Weber® Roasted garlic and herb seasoning.

This was delicious! I left out the onion because of an allergy, and it was still very good. I added extra garlic, and some red chili pepper and it gave an extra kick that was perfect. Served with fresh noodles and had plenty of sauce for a change. I only used 2 chicken breasts cut up into bite sized pieces and that was plenty. Family of 4 with left overs.

Really nice - made for two so basically just under half all ingredients. I added dried rosemary. Very creamy and lots of flavor. Sauce is a variant of alfredo sauce with a bit more of an easy taste. Easy to make and would definitely do again.

I followed the recipe in its entirety and was not disappointed! My husband is extremely picky about the food he consumes and was asking by the end of the meal"Are there any leftovers?". I appreciate all the suggestions made by others on the different options and variations on this recipe. For those that don't appreciate or like this recipe; a little advice... Take your  to Olive Garden and quit your bitching! Bravo to the original person who submitted this recipe! Thank you for adding another meal to my monthly rotation.

I followed the directions as is for a third of the ingredients but I used 8 ounces of pasta- there was plenty of sauce for my family of 4. However, it tasted like jarred pasta sauce and I don't plan on making it again.

This was a great recipe and definitely a keeper as one of our top picks when we're in the mood for some chicken alfredo! It was fantastic, but only after changing up the ingredient list a bit and I would also like to mention that the directions are WAY TOO VAGUE. First things first; the ingredients...
I used all ingredients with the exact measurements, except I used a fontina cheese instead of a Colby. Fontina has a much better melting property and it gives you that deliciously smooth texture that we all love about alfredo. It's a bit on the expensive side, but so worth it if you're wanting a more authentic alfredo taste. Aside from changing the cheese, everything else seemed great on the list. The major issue lies in the instructions, which is what I'll explain next:
I read some of the bad reviews and I believe I know where many of you went wrong. It's not really your fault if you're not well versed in the art (and sometimes anguish) of white and/or cheese sauces. If you have very little knowledge or have never done a white/cheese sauce, you'll ruin it if you follow the instructions as they are. How you prepare a white sauce is the most important key in creating the perfect texture. When it's time to add the flour and spices, DO NOT let it sit in the pan. When they said let it cook for 2 minutes, they should have specified that you need to stir CONSTANTLY for 2 minutes at a medium-low heat. Same issue with the milk and half & half. When they said to cook it until it's well b

As always, I used half the amount of pasta called for and light cream cheese instead of half and half. Turned out great. Instead of fresh, I added an un-drained can of diced tomatoes,  Tasted great though. The second time I made this I added broccoli. I use almond milk too. My 7 yr old loves it. With my changes, the calories went down to 300 and it was serving 11 good size portions.

I made this tonight for my family and got nothing but rave reviews! I thought it might be a bit too complicated for me because I'm such a cooking newbie (seriously, I'd never even cooked chicken before!) but I followed the recipe and it came out great! I didn't make any changes because I HATE it when I read reviews and see how people changed the recipe... I wish they wouldn't post reviews at all. This one is perfect just the way it is. 

My family and I decided we like it just as much as Olive Garden... and I LOVE Olive Garden lol!

I liked it but I think I used too much cheese... had to add a bunch more milk (I didn't carefully measure though).  6 chicken breast halves was too much for me and too expensive.... Next time I'll use a package of 3 halves.

This is by far the BEST chicken fettuccini alfredo I have EVER had! I will never be able to eat any other recipe again. My husband isn't even a fan of it and he couldn't stop raving it! My kids all loved it! I followed the recipe to a T! Highly recommend this to everyone!!!!!

I left out the tomatoes and mushrooms because my husband doesn't eat them.   It was absolutely delicious. My kids even ate it.

I made  this for dinner, with a few changes. I left out the mushrooms, Colby cheese, and sour cream, because I didn't have them. Used all half-and-half, instead of a combination, and Rosemary in place of Italian seasoning. Tasted great.

Incredible dish, my beautiful wife asked me to make supper. Chicken thawed in the sink and found this. Only thing I did different was substituted half and half for heavy cream and I didn't have Colby cheese so I did a little less but all Parmesan. Definitely do this again.

I selected it because I wanted to try something new. It actually turned out really good. One tip would be to start the sauce right after you start cooking your chicken.

I will definitely make this again, but next time,  I'll reduce the amount of salt, going to two teaspoons, rather than a whole tablespoon. My daughter says she wants me to make it another time when everyone else is late to supper.

This comes out wonderful every time! If there are any leftovers... the pasta seems to continue absorbing the sauce. Simply add a splash of milk when reheating, and the sauce will get "saucy" again.

I didn't use monterey jack or sour cream, came out great though. Will make it again in the future, and the method to mix butter and flour and cheese could be adapted to mac and cheese pretty easy. Very heavy and filling.

I was skeptical about Colby jack cheese and sour cream in Alfredo sauce, but this recipe is fantastic!!!   I skipped the mushrooms since no one else in my house likes them but followed the recipe otherwise.  Definitely a keeper!!

We cut the recipe by 2/3 because there is only 2 of us eating but it still made enough for us to get 3 plates from it! We added extra milk because of the thickness of the sauce, the thinned out sauce was great for dipping garlic cheese bread in. We will definitely make this again!

This was amazing! It does make a lot of sauce (we were able to eat it two nights - a pound of pasta each night) but the flavor was amazing. I did not have any problems with grainy-ness, or separation, or any of the other issues listed by other people. My only comment was that it took way longer to make than the listed time - I'm pretty slow at cutting things up and that likely slowed things a lot. Perhaps the extra time made it so the sauce cooked better? Anyway, my husband and three kids all really really loved it and want me to make it over and over and over again.

I know I shouldn't be surprised when I manage to make something really good, but it always shocks me. The older women in my family are very much against recipes which means I have no clue how to cook their food so I search for recipes and they scoff at me. This recipe was truly one for the record books, though, and I'll be able to make it again and again because its a recipe and not thrown together by someone's brain and experience :-)

This is really tasty. I cut back the Italian seasoning, no mushrooms and used more Parmesan because I didn't have any Colby. Added some parsley at the end just before serving.

Awesome recipe! I'm a fitness geek so I admit from the beginning that I HAD to make some changes but they were small. I used olive oil and smart balance, only 2T of flour, 3 cups of fat free evaporated milk, homemade Greek yogurt, and 1/2 cup of fresh parmesan cheese. I must say...reading the ingredient list warrants 5 (or more) stars alone. This is a delicious Alfredo sauce. Thank you for sharing. It's a keeper for sure!

I don't know why my review did not post but this recipe is EXCELLENT!!! Forgive me if it shows up twice but I really feel I needed to review this.  1 substitution, I swapped the sour cream for 1/2 cup of cream cheese and I added a couple of extra garlic cloves... Talk about a great recipe, this was phenomenal!!!

This is the best chicken Alfredo I've had in my opinion. I didn't have any parsley at hand, by it still came out delicious nonetheless. To people who gave bad reviews, I agree that it just depends how much or how less you like to season your food. I did add a bit of nutmeg, just a dash, and I think it gives a little something extra! Ommited the tomatoes and sour cream,  but it should be still yummy though! Wish I had a more stronger cheese to add like Gruyere cheese. Next time it will be added! Great job!

This recipe is my go to for Chicken Alfredo.  It's easy to follow and tastes amazing!  I do add a little more garlic, onion and Italian seasoning but it's not necessary to make a great tasting dish!

We loved this. Even my kids enjoyed, which is really saying a lot. Only change I made was to add some food grade sodium citrate. It acts as an emulsifier for the cheese and allows it to melt down more smooth. Because of that addition it was a little too salty so next time I will not add the additional salt.

Loved it! I have been searching for this recipe for so long. I made minor changes. I halfed the recipe to serve 3 people. I didn't add sour cream or  Colby Jack cheese. Just parmesan. I also used fat free milk. and when serving I added Parsley on top. DELICIOUS RECIPE. I wasn't sure about the tomatoes but I didn't mind a little sweetness in all this creaminess.

Note: for all those saying the sauce crumbled because of the flour. Well you should not only add the milk so slowly but also it is best to use a manual mixer to smooth the sauce out as you keep stiring .

This is really good my family loves it!! I added a handful of spinach at the end when I added the milk and cream because I love beautiful colorful food. I also used red pepper for the extra flavor. I didn't use as much butter as recommended or as much cheese. I used maybe 3 table spoons of butter for the entire dish. Definitely one of my favorites to make my awesome family :)

We liked it!!!  I tried to do as the directions stated. However, It would have been nice to know how many pounds of chicken was needed for the recipe, since breast size varies quite a bit. There seemed to be more A LOT  more  sauce than  noodles.I wasn't sure if I had a pan large enough. I decided to made extra noodles the next night and gave the extra left overs to a neighbor. I added steamed broccoli with each serving which I think really made the dish. Thank you for posting your recipe.

If I wanted Mac and cheese maybe this would be it. Very cheesy, and totally lacking subtlety. Will not be recommending this dish to anyone who  does not love Mac and cheese (I don't)!

This was pretty good, kind of bland. It's not really an Alfredo sauce. It reminded me more of tetrazzini.

Just made this & it turned out perfect! I left out the tomatoes, added pieces of bacon. I used one less cup of milk & I will use either 1/2 to 3/4 tablespoon of salt. Everyone loved it.

Didn't have mushrooms so I used bacon bits and I substituted cheddar jack for the Colby jack and it was great. It made a lot so next time I would half the recipe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. It's a bit more work than most recipes, but it's worth it. It makes enough to feed about 20 people, so I always half everything and it still feeds my family of 4 with leftovers.

I made this for dinner last night and it tasted amazing. It wasn't the easiest dish I've ever made, and I may never make it again - unless it's a special occasion and requested because this dish takes work. I'm not the most experienced cook, but I know my way around and can make some pretty mean meals. I was worn out after preparing AND eating this one!!! I spent a while trying to get the sauce started and making sure it was smooth and creamy. Worth it!! The sauce is amazing!! Very, very rich and cheesy. 

Also!! Make sure you are using a big ol' pan with the sauce, because when you add the chicken you will not have much extra space for splashes or messy stirring. 

Overall- The husband loved it and the kids ate it, so that makes it a win. It also makes enough for a couple of days of leftovers.

This is the first time I've made chicken Alfredo. I usually don't like creamy recipes but it's hubby's favorite dish so I felt ambitious. LOVED IT!! A little too cheesy for me personally but he loved, loved it. He said it was perfect! Recipe is a keeper!

Amazing dish! Super easy to make but next time I will use less garlic. I'm not a fan of garlic, so maybe instead of 4 cloves, I'll use 3. But overall, very tasty! :)

I cooked this awesome pasta tonight, and I just turned my laptop on, to write this review and ask you not to miss the opportunity of eating the best ever pasta...
although I didn't have all the ingredients, e.g sour cream, or that specific cheese, but it was still perfect.

This is a pretty good recipe. I go pretty heavy on the garlic because garlic is awesome.  Also the only ingredients that I use are chicken, onions, and garlic.   For the sauce, I only use milk.  Of course I tweak it a little with some seasonings.  But even with that, the family loves the recipe.  I serve this with steamed broccoli and garlic toast. Yummy!

I usually do not post recipe reviews but wow! Well worth the prep time. I absolutely recommend adding the tomatoes as the recipe calls for. I used canned as that was all I had but it gave the sauce a little something extra. Loved the colby jack cheese too! I also added mozzarella to use up what I had.  My whole family loved it, even went back for seconds. This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

Restaurant quality!!! My favorite chicken Alfredo recipe by far! The recipe is perfect the way it is, the only thing I do different is add broccoli instead of mushrooms, as my husband and I are not a fan of mushrooms.

This was so delicious! The only changes I made were that I didn't happen to have an onion, so I left that out. And I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes since I didn't have Roma tomatoes. I also cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of butter until lightly browned. But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Wow! The flavor was amazing. I've never found an alfredo sauce in a jar that I've really ever liked. This recipe was packed with flavor and cheese and garlic and everything yummy! No more jarred Alfredo for me, ever again!!!

This recipe requires a lot more time/effort than stated above (but especially if you add additional ingredients such as broccoli which, for example, would be cooked in a separate pot on the stove). I made this meal for only my husband and myself and wished I had saved it for a large party because it's so heavy and filling with garlic toast on the side. Plenty of leftovers.

This recipe is amazing.  My family won't eat fettucine Alfredo in the restaurant anymore because it's not as good as this recipe.  I've made it without sour cream and it is still amazing.   When it is leftover and reheated it doesn't separate like so many Alfredos out there.  I think I like that the most.  I have also made it without tomatoes and onions.  And yes, it's still amazing.  The garlic is a must though.    It's my go-to dinner as long as I have the half and half in my frig.  There's a reason the rating on this recipe is so high.  You won't be disappointed!

I made this for two young picky eaters, I omitted the tomatoes, mushrooms and sour cream and added steamed broccoli.  They ate 2 bowls each!  Thanks!

Great, super easy recipe.  Had baked chicken breast from the night before and decided to use the leftovers in this recipe.  Went together quickly.  Has a great balance of flavor with the italian dressing, garlic, onion and mushroom.  It is rich with the half-and-half and sour cream but isn't that the point of alfredo!  As for the negative reviews, I can only say practice your gravy skills - sauce should never be lumpy (try premixing your flour with liquid before adding) and always taste the gravy to spice to your taste.  This is a good, quick and easy recipe for a hungry bunch needing some good ol' comfort food!

Love this recipe! it's really simple and really good! the only thing I do differently is add chicken. My husband loves for me to fix it. His recipes have never turned out good as far as the sauce. they always thickly den up and get gritty and clumpy. This recipe stays smooth. I love it!

This was approved by all! I used chicken bacon stuffed pasta. I added bacon to the sauce & used cremini mushrooms. Added fresh chopped curly parsley. Left out the half & half. Also used a pre-shredded tex-mex cheese blend with Monterey jack & jalapenos Delicious!

I was a little thrown off by Colby-Monterey cheese, but this was amazing! My family and I agreed that this is better than a restaurant. This makes a large amount, so next time I make it, I plan to freeze some so I can get two or three meals from it.

Great recipe!!! I baked my chicken at 350 for 40 minutes and flipped them half way thru came out at 167 degrees perfect-I am not a fan of skillet cooked chicken. I made a few changes to the recipe, but this was a great base to go off of. Definitely keeping this one!!

I love this recipe. So does my entire family. I hate tomatoes so I axe those and the mushrooms add an earthy taste that the family doesn't enjoy so those get left out also. I use strictly white cheeses and add some extra spices in with the chicken when sautéing it. The amounts for the Alfredo sauce are nearly perfect   This is a fantastic recipe to start with and add your own flair. Sometimes I throw in broccoli and that adds color and bite.

This was my first time making a chicken alfredo and I couldn't have been happier. This was so delicious I ate till I was miserable. I did have to make the sauce twice because I burnt the onion and garlic when I was sauteing them. I was also worried when I added flour and cooked for 2 minutes. The mixture was just a clump. But it is very important to keep mixing at a fast past when adding the remaining ingredient or you will have a lot of clumps in the sauce. I also recommend making twice the pasta or half the sauce because it makes a lot of sauce. overall this was awesome.

I followed recipe exactly and I was so excited about this recipe with all the great reviews it got but mine turned out really, really, bland.  I cut the recipe down so maybe that was the problem...i just don't know.  Not creamy at all even though I did what it said and I cook Alot!  Will not be making again though...it was a bummer!

This recipe was only ok.  When I completed the sauce and tasted it with the chicken, it was great.  However, once I put it on the noodles, it became very bland.  I think it would have needed a lot more spice.

Let me start by saying that I did make a slight modification, as I did not have half and half cream on hand, so I did not use it, so this may have altered the result, but I don't anticipate the addition of cream being a make or break here. I was disappointed with the results, given the amount of effort that this took, and the amount of very rich ingredients i expected a very flavourful and multi dimensional dish. To my surprise it turned out to be very bland. This may be because I used extra milk in place of the cream, but the results were just a so-so dish. It was even an effort to get my pasta loving kids to finish their meals. Not bad, but certainly not worth the effort, and the calories!  Sorry.

We loved this recipe! Since I had plenty of red bell peppers I added it to the onion. Only other thing I did differently was I did not use any sour cream - because I forgot to add it! The recipe calls for boneless chicken breasts. I had some cooked chicken leg quarters and wanted to make something with it other then the usual. When I found this recipe I decided it would work to use this cooked meat, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly and it worked well. And it was still delicious! A note about the Parmesan cheese: I used shaved Parmesan, not the ready grated that comes in a can. Will make it again - am looking forward to serving it to our children when they come home!

I tried this recipe for the first time and it was awful. I followed the recipe to the T. There was way too much sauce and the flavor was bland.I was highly disappointed because I thought that the dish would be delicious and not to mention the money I wasted at the grocery store. The $1 Michelina alfredo is 10x better and cheaper without disappointments.

It was amazing!  Tastes just like the linguine chicken tetrazzini from East Side Marios. I added bacon to it as well.  I will make this one again and again.  LOVE IT!

I used 1/2 of an onion and omitted mushroom and it came out perfect for our family.  Thanks for a great recipe and this will be cooked quite often in our house now. :)

i thought this was very good, nice and rich and the flavors blended together very well.  as for people who thought it was too runny i'm assuming you just didn't cook it long enough.  you have to really get the flour saturated in the butter then add the milk very very slowly.  it will build up as you pour and then stir.  once the the milk was fully incorporated i still cooked it down a little bit before adding the cheese. my sauce was the perfect texture (although there was still waaay to much of it).  almost any sauce will thicken the longer its cooked esp cream based ones.

So yummy! My husband woke up this morning still thinking about how good it was.  Had leftover sauce to freeze but their was only the 2 of us who ate.  I made a few changes...I did not put tomatoes in it but I did slice sweet yellow and red peppers. Sooooo awesome.

This was right up there with the restaurants.  Make sure to cook the flour well, or will be grainy sauce.  My husband and I and our two exchange students from Spain and Germany all loved it.  The sour cream is not needed and the colby jack could be cheddar or another cheese and be good too!  added some green and red peppers since I didn't have any mushrooms, and it was great!

This recipe is excellent, easy to make and endless possibilities, my hubby loved this...he wanted to add bacon bits at the end and instead of chicken add scallops and shrimp. Going to try bacon with the leftovers.

This recipe was very good. I did make some changes. Didn't add the tomatoes or onions. Used fat free sour cream and heavy whip. This made the sauce so delicious that my husband wanted to lick it all up. There were definitely no leftovers when I made this recipe and it was to feed 12 adults! I also did not add any flour since the cheese thickened up my sauce. And used an extra stick of slated butter. :) also added a tbsp of creole seasoning to it to give it a kick.

I don't know why I didn't make this sooner but this was a hit.
It was so delicious and easy to make. I'm not sure if it's still called chicken alfredo as I used Havarti and cheddar instead because I didn't have parmesan and monterey jack. It still tasted so good.

Okay, I have had this recipe twice in my home, the most recent time being 1 day ago. The first time, I followed it to a "T," and it was okay but SO bland. I mean REALLY bland. It basically tasted like a mushroom cream sauce. I even added fresh chopped red pepper and that didn't help much. Had lots of leftovers that no one ate and ended up being thrown away. Mind you, I have a household of 6 people normally, with a brother whose friends use our house as the local watering hole (lol). My point being that typically my men devour anything, and they didn't really dive for this one. The second time I added my own twist to the recipe, and it was "EXQUISITE" according to my sister who's a chef in training, and my brother and his friends.
Here are the changes I made:
-I added grated Romano, asiago, mozzarella, & ricotta cheese. I added a half cup of the Romano; just a little of the ricotta (about 2 tablespoons; and a half a cup of a combined mixture of the asiago and mozzarella (it also had parmesan cheese in it).
-I grilled the chicken on my Foreman- I seasoned with Italian Herb Seasoning from McCormick.
-I added MUCH less of the Colby jack and Monterrey cheese than the 6oz it called for- a handful and a pinch (sorry I don't measure when I cook sometimes)
-I added spinach
-I added a little more flour
- I used wheat linguine noodles and normal fettuccine noodles (mostly the wheat linguine, however).
-I'm not sure if this matters, but I used sea salt and portobello mushrooms

Amazing and delicious!! I was very impressed with this recipe! I had to add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also added a little more garlic and garlic powder because in the beginning it didn't have enough flavor for me. The end result- FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe to a T minus the above corrections. I was overall very impressed and will be making again! Not too soon though, since it's pretty fattening... but isn't everything that tastes good?!! LOL!

From the first time I made this, i fell in love! It's so good, i couldn't believe I had made it. But the recipe makes A LOT, it barely fit in my pan. I am going to try to cut everything in half to make a smaller portion.

Just made this tonight and it's Delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I scooped some sauce out for myself before I added the chicken. It is so creamy, garlicy, and mmm..goood. Left out the mushrooms. But added some chopped sundried tomato, which I HIGHLY recommend! This dish took me an hour and a half to prepare, but will be quicker next time now that I know what I'm doing.

I really loved this recipe, possibly the best dinner recipe on here or tied with the Chicken Marsala. I used a jar of premade Alfredo sauce and just the parmesan/romano cheese to top it off with, which is not even needed because it is so good!  Easy and delicious! I will definitely be making this again and again!

Just made this recipe for the Cross Country carb load dinner and it is delicious!  I followed it to the letter and it turned out fantastic!  My husband even asked if we had to send all of it to the dinner and he's a tough critic.  Thanks for the yummy recipe, it made it to my make again list.

This recipe was really yummy! I added bacon and baby spinach as extra ingredients to make it really come together. I also added more flour than what was suggested in order to get a more creamier sauce. My boyfriend definitely had seconds ;)

This is the best alfredo EVER - better than Olive Garden. It has become our every Friday night dinner. All three of our kids love it, even our 1 year old. Definately prep all your food before you start.

I added brocolli to my alfredo, and the sauce was delicious! It was raved about by my kids even!I worried a little about using jarred minced garlic and non-fat half/half, but it turned out great. I have never found a pre-made jarred alfredo that I liked, so I am thrilled to have a recipe to make when I get the craving!

OK, I didn't add the tomatoes because it just didn't feel right, and I just went with regular Monterey Jack cheese (not Colby blend) and it was FABULOUS.  Rivaled anything I've ever tasted in a good Italian restaurant.  Seriously.  This one is a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe but I just changed it up a little bit to make it healthier and easier. I put my frozen chicken in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours. I put in the ingredients (italian seasing, minced garlic, salt and water) in the crock pot. I took the chicken out and browned it on the stove for about 3 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly after that but I wanted to make this recipe a little healthier so I used brown rice spiral noodles (honestly SO much better than whole grain). I used plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream which gave it an even better flavor. I didn't use as much Parmesan and cheese. The healthier version turned out AMAZING. I will be making this again!!!

This was a huge hit in my household. My grandmother was from Sicily and needless to say she taught me how to cook from an early age. Grandma would have been proud when I pulled this one off.

It turned out very thick. You need to gradually add the cheese and stir continuously. I added sautéed fresh mushrooms and chicken.

This is a very tasty and not to time consuming recipe. I followed it exactly other than leaving out the salt. Im still not sure but i think i used too much chicken, which worked out fine because my husband loves meat! I thought it meant to use 6 chicken breasts, which i did and it was a lot of meat. It still tasted super though, so if you like a really meaty dish just use 6 breasts! I still used the same amount of everything else. Turned out great!!!

This recipe truly deserves 5 stars!  I scaled it down to 4 servings and easily got 6 (it's very rich). I used light cream, but next time I'll just use plain milk.  This tastes better than any dish from a restaurant!

A-MAY-ZING!!!!! this was unbelievably delicious and I think its my new favorite thing to eat!! WARNING: make sure you have all the ingredients prepared before beginning to cook or you will be very frazzled and probably will make a mistake. I didn't prepare my ingredients and I ended up adding my chicken alfredo to stiff dryish fettuccini. Anyway, My mom and I loved this but my weird boyfriend just thought that it was "fine". Idk but he is SUPER picky and he has very confused taste buds. :p The leftovers were still awesome for the next couple of days (I know this because I fixed myself a plate everyday :D) and I can't wait to make it again! Try this recipe because you won't be disappointed!!!!

My family loved this I used 1/2 cup cornstarch instead of flour because I only had milk. So I used 4 cups milk and 1 cup water. I was expecting a little left overs at least for lunch tomorrow, how wrong I was they soaked up everything with garlic bread! great recipe I will use this one over and over.

This was so yummy and so simple to make! I didn't have any milk on hand (just the half and half) so I added some water. I also didn't have the Colby-Monterey, so I mixed in 2 slices of Swiss and handfuls of shredded cheddar. The recipe can handle substitutions.

This dish smelled a lot better than it ended up tasting.  I think the next time I try, I'll omit the tomatoes and sour cream.  The sour cream taste/smell was a bit too strong.  I will also try less garlic (never thought I'd say that!).

My 16 yr old son made this and I think this is an amazing sauce! Some changes we would make next time would be to dice the onion really fine, and let the sauce cook longer. Omit the chicken cuz really this needs NOTHING.. we even make it into a chicken alfredo pizza with some fresh chopped spinach mixed in.. HEAVEN!

Made this last night for the family and it was awesome.  Wife came home from work while I was halfway through cooking and she couldn't believe how good it smelled.

I will never make Chicken Alfredo any other way. It was amazing and everyone loved it. I don't know how anyone could dislike this recipe as long as it's followed correctly. I did cut it in half because I only had to feed 3 people and I substituted black pepper for the white only because I prefer it. It was delicious I can't wait to make it again! Thank youu!

Yum! Just made chicken alfredo for the first time last night. I followed this recipe and the family thought it was very good!  I will be making this again and will add broccolli and maybe use less tomato. The sauce was very smooth and the mushrooms give it a delicious flavor. (If you don't like the texture of mushrooms & tomato, maybe put in blender?). Next time, I will use a little less milk or add a bit more flour to thicken my sauce. It did seem to be missing just a bit of something, but it could be because I used italian dressing instead of a powder seasoning. Overall, we liked it, and to minimize the work, husband & daughter helped prep by shredding & cutting :)

Tried this for the first time tonight.  One of my sons is a vegetarian - which worked perfectly with this recipe.    At the last point I was able to separate his portion of the sauce before I added the chicken.  The seasoning was very nice.

This was really good! I made a couple changes but my whole family loved it. I didn't add the mushrooms because I don't like them and I didn't have any sour cream. My 2 year old daughter even had seconds!

WOW! Rarely do I follow a recipe to the T (okay almost I left out the tomato) but I did this one. It was great. The kids ate seconds and I plan on reheating me a bowl before bed. 
I will definatly be making this again. I used a little less than half of a packet of the zesty italian seasoning and it was perfect.

I usually prepare a recipe the first time exactly how it is written and then make changes the next time I prepare it...but NOT this time. This is a keeper in my book and is tucked safely away in my notebook! The entire family loved it including the 1 year old!

This became an instant family favorite the first time I made it. The tomatoes add a great taste. Also, it's good with asparagus on the side.

Delicious. I have used this recipe as a way of using up leftover roast chicken, and it comes out great when I just add the chicken to the sauce at the end  and let it simmer until hot.

This was the first true sauce I have made and I was concerned that I wouldn't do it right (it helped having a second pair of hands to do the stirring while I got other things going) but it was fantastic!!!

This recipe is versitile and the sauce is wonderful! I sometimes omit the chicken for a veggie fettuccini. I use different veggie combinations: spinach, onion, mushroom with some crumbled bacon thrown in; brocolli & red bell pepper; asparagus & mushrooms. I find the sauce to be a bit thicker than I like with 1/3 c flour so I usually cut it down to 1/4 c & am carefull not to overcook.

Very good, except don't add the tablespoon of salt it's way too much, also use heavy cream instead of half & half. I used half the onion they suggest...suit to taste

I pretty much NEVER follow recipes exactly, but this was my first alfredo, i am a big red sauce eater :) I followed the recipe exactly (wait, I doubled the tomatoes) and it was better than I was expecting it to be. My boyfriend loved it. The only thing I may do differently next time is grill the chicken and put it on top rather than in the sauce, i might add even more tomatoes and some spinach but that's just because I like it. Overall this was very easy to follow and I'm so glad I tried it :)

I can't figure out why this recipe calls for 6 (SIX!) boneless chicken breast halves. I did the same recipe, but with only 3 chicken breast halves, and ended up with plenty of chicken. If I had used 6, I would have ended up with a main course of chicken with a few noodles thrown in! hah.

Great recipe, otherwise..

I made this dish as written, and it was delicious.  The tomatoes were a surprisingly nice addition.  Next time, I may omit the sour cream; I'm surprised the taste of that little bit of sour cream came through so much.  I will also add peas.  And it needs a spicy kick.  I added dried and ground jalapenos to mine at the table.  This will definitely go in my meal rotation.

My daughter usually says, "Mom, this was really good. Will you make it again?" Not with this meal. We ate it. No one had seconds and no one made any comments. I personally thought it a wierd combination that didn't quite taste right together.

A wonderful Italian dish that all 6 family members loved!  I served it over a whole-wheat pasta and added 1/4 cup bell pepper and a dash of nutmeg.  I love it and will make it over and over.

WOW!!! I am Italian and not a fan of " Italian American" food. This recipe blows away any other chicken fettucine alfredo that I have tried, even in restaurants! The whole family loved it!! The sauce is amazing exactly as is!! I wouldn't change a thing ;)

Excellent recipe.  I did not add the onion or tomato (hubby can't have either) everything else stayed the same.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank you Emily.

Simply AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe to par with the exception of the Colby-Monterey Jack cheese (didn't have any on hand). I made this scrumptious dish and took some left overs to my Mom and she asked me which restaurant I bought it from!  Not that I'm a bad cook or anything, but she couldn't believe that I made it from scratch and was grilling me on what ingredients I used.  5 stars plus!!!!!!

Fantastic! I didn't think chicken alfredo could be this easy to make. A few things I omitted because I didn't have on hand were tomatoes and mushrooms, but it still turned out great. I will add mushrooms/broccoli next time. The only thing I'll try to change next time is adding flour and perhaps more mild/half-half.

This was an incredible recipe, and turned out REALLY good!!  I did make a few revisions, and it was still great!  The amount of chicken was reduced to 4 breasts cubed, due to the large size and amount of chicken.  I thought 1 Tbl spoon of salt was an awful lot, so didn't fill it up; and lastly, I only put 3 cut, minced cloves of garlic in w/the chicken.  There were just two of us, and the amount this recipe made left plenty for another dinner or lunches for a few days.

Middle of the road.  My boyfriend and I made this for dinner tonight.  We followed the recipe in the beginning then added here and there as we saw fit.  We LOVE fettuccini alfredo! This fell short for us.  Sauce was grainy, didn't have creamy alfredo taste or texture.  It was a good "pasta dish" but missed the mark as an alfredo dish.  The taste was a little bland, we added extra parm and more italian spices.  We didn't care for the taste that the colby-monterey jack provided.  We'll give it another try but will probably use provolone or perhaps only parm. cheese, just in a larger quantity.  Not a bad dish, just didn't really suit our tastes.

I didn't have mushrooms to use so in it's place I thawed out some frozen broccoli.  It turned out GREAT!  I will make this again using mushrooms and broccoli.  Also, I think zucchini would work too.  I may use only 1/2 of the onion the next time around because my husband thought it was a little much.  All in all this was great as written and we can't wait to try it again!

Oh god, it's so delicious. I made a some mistakes, like I added a lot of butter, luckily I quickly took some off. Overall, it's easy to make. It wasn't too spicy from the pepper. First time using white pepper. :)  I ate a lot... I don't think I can make it. I'm sooo full! T-T

Not sure what happened!  After I added the flour to the onions, garlic and butter it was so lumpy!  By the time I added the milk...I had a chunky bland sauce that tasted like wet flour!!I had to throw the entire batch out!!  :(

I think I may have done this wrong, but I would say this is just average. When I added the milk and half and half, the consistency did not change all that much so I ended up adding more flour and corn starch at the end. I also added lots of veggies, which made the volume go up a ton and now I feel this recipe could last me (one person) about 2 weeks. This is VERY filling and leaves me feeling bloated. Just half a 3/4 cups of pasta with this sauce leaves me feeling very full. The taste reminds me of my college dining hall cream sauce. I like the fettucini alfredo I've had at some restaurants better.

I made this last night for dinner.  Superb!!!!!!  The only ingredient amount I found confusing was the amount of garlic to use.  After mincing two entire gloves of garlic, I thought that is enough.  So, the amount I used was 5-6 tablespoons, saving 2 for the last step.  I definitely will prepare this for a dinner again.

This is the best chicken alfredo recipe ever! We made it exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out great and makes excellent leftovers :)! Serves about 4 good size portions with the 1 pound of fettucine, but needs to make some more pasta for the leftover sauce. I would add additional milk and use two cups of half and half and two cups of milk :)!

Wow, absolutely amazing. BETTER than the Olive Garden!! I tried to make the recipie exactly as written, but while making the sauce, it started to look soupy, so I stopped adding the milk. I used 1 cup half-half and maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk. Turned out great! I cant wait to make this for guests. It is a very impressive, delicious and easy recipie! Thanks!

Excellent dish! Good enough to serve to company. Next time i'll omit the tomatoes though and fry some red pepppers with the mushroooms. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

Grilled Chicken, no need to saute garlic/italian seasoning.  Only needs 1tsp salt and less italian seasoning when added right before milk.  Used fat free half & half w/skim milk.  Makes alot!  Husband really liked!

I really love it. Two weeks ago I cooked Chickken Fettuccini Alfredo to my family, I was really nervous. Didn't want to mess up. But, I felt good when my husband told me that It's like eating in Olive Garden =)

This makes a lot of cheese sauce that takes away from the chicken. I will cut the sauce down to half next time. I also made it with out the tomatoes and still came out wonderful!

I've made this meal several times already, and it always comes out excellent! Sometimes I make it with just the chicken and no mushrooms, so I just add a bit more of chicken. You can play with the measurements to your liking, but it's pretty awesome just the way it is.

Wish I could have given it six stars.  I couldn't imagine Italian spices in a cheese sauce.  But, wow!  I made it exactly as written and it was just perfect.  I cut the tomatoes in 12ths and put the pieces over the fettuccini then put the sauce over it and sprinkled it with parsley.  Very pretty presentation.  I would think using grape tomatoes would work well, expecially if they were leftovers.

GREAT RECIPE EXCEPT USE LESS FLOUR AS IT BECOMES TOO THICK WITH ALL THE CHEEESE CALLED FOR.   WHILE REHEATING THE NEXT NIGHT I ADDED  WHITE WINE AND SOME CAYENNE PEPPER.  "SUPER ADDITION"..

This had a weird aftertaste.  Not sure what exactly it was.  The sauce did not get creamy either.  It was gritty.  Will not make again the same way.  I think it has potential though and may try again with modifications.

Can easily serve more than 8, especially if a salad and bread are part of the menu.  Easy to prepare and delicious!  I omitted the salt.

Delicious, but if I have to make any modifications it doesn't merit 5 stars.  I thought the sour cream at the end accentuated the bitterness, it was nicely rich and sweet before adding it; I used heavy cream instead of hald and half...I always try to stay true to the recipe but the cream was calling for this dish!  Also, the chicken was quite bland without added salt while cooking, and it needed browning before turning out of the pan. I found the timing of the fettucini cooking was off; the water should be at the boil while cooking the onions but add the fettucini while you are adding the milk/cream and waiting for that to heat up and your fettucini should be cooked as the other is heated through with the cheese.  I also omitted the tomatoes.

My gosh this is FANTASTIC! I did, however make a few changes on it. I only used one garlic clove, 3/4tablespoon of Italian seasoning, 3/4tablespoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper(instead of ground white pepper), half a regular tomato-diced, 3/4 onion and 3/4 mushrooms. It is the best thing I have ever tasted, a total success. And the leftovers are amazing(: Definitely a re-maker(:

Great Dish. Added some white wine while sauteing the onions and mushrooms. Had so much fun making this dish I forgot to put oil in the noodles to keep them from sticking. Great sauce though. Thank you!

Really delicious and tastes better than at a restaurant! I live in the UK, so substituted single cream for the half & half and used farmhouse cheddar for the monterey jack (I think Edam or any easy melting cheese would work well). I also added a dash of nutmeg. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and got rave reviews by family and friends. It's a keeper!

I used to rely on Chicken Helper Chicken Alfredo, but this recipe blew it out of the water!  It's got a nice, creamy alfredo sauce that is awesome!  I used penne instead of fettucine because it is easier to eat and we have a little one.  I also didn't use tomatoes or mushrooms(again b/c we have a little one).  It was a little too garlicy for my taste, but i have never used fresh garlic before(always garlic powder) and I only put 2 cloves of garlic in it, but they were jumbo garlic.  Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly and it was great.  ITS EVEN BETTER THAN OLIVE GARDENS CHICKEN ALFREDO TOO!

Tasted Great!  Although it made alot!  I cut the recipe in half and we still have leftovers.  For 4 people with a side salad and garlic bread, a quarter of the recipe would probably be plenty.

I found the recipe too salty. I could've gone with ommitting the salt, perhaps maybe just 1 tsp or so. I had to add extra half and half, milk, and sour cream, to calm down the saltiness, but after that, it was good. I might try it again, minus the salt next time.

This was an excellent fettuccini! I rated it as 4 stars because I "made it my own." Since I only had skim milk, I used whole cream instead of half and half- I thought that would make it better. I also didn't have any other cheese besides parm, so I just added extra parm instead. I didn't use any of the vegetables, so it was just the meat. Delicious! My husband loved it!

I really loved this recipe. The best part was that there was plenty of sauce to coat the pasta and chicken so that you weren't left wanting more. All of the flavors were so delicious together.

This was awesome!!  I made a lot of changes but the base of the sauce was pretty close.  I used grilled salmon and added steamed broccoli.  I used whipping cream inesated of half/half because that is what I had on hand. I thought 1tbls of salt was alot so I used 1 tsp.  I didnt add the tomatoes or sour cream at the end.  So It was a salmon broccoli alredo pasta...more or less.  Awesome!!

It was pretty good but it reminded me of something out of a Michelina's frozen entree box. I prefer a white sauce with sour cream, butter, cream cheese, parm. cheese, milk and seasonings. I didn't really care for the colby cheese mixture & flour in the sauce. I am really picky, though. I know most people would give this 5 stars. It is just my preference.

I would have to give this a 5 star! Best one I had.. creamy and surprisingly very good as left over too :) My boyfriend loved it and asked for second. I recommended reducing the portion if your cooking for 2 people as it's a lot of food.

This was a hit with the office!  I increased the scale to 20 servings and took it in for a luncheon.  I got so many compliments.  This will definitely become one of my favorites!!  Such a smooth taste that keeps you going back for more.

I was ok with this recipe. Next time I will go without the white ground pepper. It has a terrible smell to me & that's all I could smell when I was eating it. My husband on the other hand really like it which I was surprised about. He is Hispanic & a no recipe needed kind of cook so he is sometimes hard to please when it comes to new recipes. But the plate was clean when he was finished!!

I was skeptical at first when I read the recipe.  Monteray jack cheese? In an alfredo sauce?    I changed this to what I had on hand.  I did not have any mushrooms, forgot the garlic and only vine ripened tomatoes.  I increased the sauce ingredients 1 1/2 times and used 1 1/2 lbs of spaghetti.   This was wonderful!!!!  Hubby could not believe how fast this came together.  Everyone gave it two thumbs up!  This will go into the regular rotation. Thanks for this.

I just made this for dinner tonight, I've had the craving for it for about a week now!  It was a hit with the whole family!  I used a tad more garlic than what the recipe called for and had to use black pepper because I forgot to buy white pepper.  Great dish!

Cooked as directed and ended up more like gravy.  Tried a different recipe without the gravy, let it cook longer and it turned out better.  Great flavor, not a fan of the texture.  Sorry!

i followed the recipe exactly as written but did not really like the result of it. i sauce was not at the smoothness that i wanted it to be at. it had chunks of cheese that would not melt and etc. however, the taste was pretty delicious. the sauce yields for about 2 pounds of pasta, not 1. i will definitely try this again but saute the garlic and onions on a different skillet, while i slowly mix in the half and half into the roux. (hopefully that will get rid of the weird texture i do not like)

I am not an advanced cook and this recipe turned out great. It was very flavorful and my husband (the picky eater in the family) loved it. I did taste it occasionally (throughout the steps) and I only used 4 oz of the Colby-Jack cheese.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It's good but not what I was expecting, especially with such a high rating. First off, this makes a HUGE amount of food, so unless you have a large family or you like eating leftovers for days, you'll want to cut it back. The sauce is very heavy, not surprisingly. The taste is good but overall I prefer a lighter traditional alfredo sauce that's not so thick and overwhelming.

My son and I followed the recipe as it was written.  The result was a delicious meal that had my son thinking he was quite the chef. Thank you for this great, and easy to follow, recipe.

This was really good.  Followed as directed and added asparagus too.  Next time would like to add some Cajun Spices for a little extra flavor.

This recipe was ok, in the end I had to add a ton of generic italian seasoning because it tasted like sour cream and milk.  My husband says "isn't it supposed to have green stuff in it?"  Secondly, it was expensive.  Mushrooms $2.50, chicken $9, fettuchini $4, half and half $1.50, milk $3.50, parmesan $5, shredded colby jack $6, garlic $5, onion $1.50, tomatoes $3 = about a $40 dinner!!

Very Good.  My family enjoyed it.  My son (age 14) suggested adding broccoli.  So, I will give that a try next time.  And like the other reviewers I strongly suggest you get the ingredients together ahead of time.

We made this for my birthday dinner and it didn't disappoint!  Everyone loved it and we're definitely going to be making it more often.  The only change I made was that we needed 2 pounds of pasta to go with all the sauce.  The leftovers were really good reheated too :)

This was good.  I cut it in half and it made enough for 6 LARGE servings. Other than adding broccoli, I did everything as directed.  The reviewer who suggested having everything measured out and ready to pour in, was right on.  I ended up having to draft my daughter to help me get things out of the refrigerator, etc. as I was tied up with stirring the flour mixture and chopping things when I also needed to be doing other things.  My kids ooohed and awwwed as they were eating it and kept telling me how good it was.  When I placed the plate in front of my 7 year old, she said, "this is pretty fancy!"  I laughed, because I had remembered some of the reviewers saying it was a fancy italian restaurant type recipe.  This was better than canned sauce, but compared to the extra work and ingredients, I can't decide if it's worth it.

This was simply incredible.  I read most of the reviews, but decided to stick with the recipe as is and thought it turned out fantastic.  I served it with some bruschetta and an artichoke, and my husband absolutely loved it.  I will definitely make it again, and often!

This recipe is delicious. The only changes I made was omit the mushrooms, I didn't have any, and added sliced olives instead. It really doesn't taste like alfredo sauce but is definitely good. I will make this often.

This recipe was good but by no means great.  The sauce had a good flavor but it didn't blow me away like I was hoping.  The sauce also ended up a bit gritty in texture.

This is an incredible fettuccine alfredo! Next time I'll make the sauce a bit thinner because it thickens a lot when it cools, but this is only personal preference. I added fresh thyme to the chicken and a couple extra cloves of garlic. It's delicious as it is, but next time I think I'll try some kalamata olives and/or capers to give it a kick. Delicious!

FANTASTIC!   I'd lost my very simple recipe and went on the hunt for something similar.  This has more ingredients than my 'old' recipe - but was not hard to put together. And the flavor was amazing! I added a dash of nutmeg to the chicken as it browned, and then across the plate just before serving, and no one noticed it wasn't my old recipe!!   It does produce a LOT of sauce, but I put the sauce in the fridge (no noodles involved) and we had it again 2 nights later.  It reheated on the stove top nicely and tasted just as good (my husband said 'even better')as it did the first night.  Anyone who wants to impress - this dish will definately get results!!

I made an oppsie and didn't see it called for sour cream so I left that out.  Other than adding shrimp to keep the chicken company, I made no other changes.  Absolutely restaurant quality.

I have been looking for the perfect alfredo recipe for so long now.  I tried this one and it is absolutely amazing!  I have recommended it to all my friends and family.  Of course, I did have to change a couple things.  I did not put in the mushrooms or diced tomatoes since they aren't a favorite at my house.  I did add in some peas to give it a nice additional flavor.  I've been looking for an alfredo recipe similar to Carrabba's and this is as close as I think it gets!  Thank you for posting it!

WOW!!  This recipe is incredible!  We just added shrimp in addition to the chicken...YUM!  It made enough to freeze some, and we ate it 3 times within 2 weeks!  It's the best italian sauce of any type I've ever had!!

The sauce was a bit bland for us.... although I was out of garlic.  I added shredded parmesean.  Maybe it would have been much better with the garlic....  I probably won't make this one again, but will try another.

I have been making this recipe for several years now and its my go to recipe for fettuccini alfredo whenever I want to make it.  The amount of flavor I get out of it is incredible.  This rivals some of my favorite restaurants and blows away the mediocre ones.  I follow the recipe exactly and will admit that I do not empty the entire pan of sauce into the noodles since there normally is a lot extra but that's okay since I found that storing the leftover sauce and reheating it the next day actually increased the flavors tremendously.  Thank you for the great recipe, I will be storing this one in my book for this particular meal.

This was great!  I did not add the roma's for the b/f's sake, and will probably add broccoli the next time for a little color, but, just as it was, it was great!  Definitely worth the time and it really is a one pot wonder!

Loved this recipe!  I sauteed and added red and green peppers and broccoli after the fettuccini was cooked, and it made it all the better!!  I also used fat free half and half, and I couldn't tell the difference.

I usually just use store-bought sauce, but this time I decided to surprise my family with a homemade sauce. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand for this recipe, except for the mushroom, and it came out phenomenal.  My husband and son noticed right away that it was not the same sauce I use.  The sour cream and colby cheese added to it's deliciousness.  I am definetely making this often.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe, I had to cut down on the recipe and found that I may have added a bit too much cheese (parmesan & colby), but no big deal since I LOVE cheese which only added to the taste. I didn't change a thing, but all ingredients should be measured and set aside, makes it easier to just grab and add as needed. Thank you my family really enjoyed this recipe, will definitely make this one again and again!!!

I just love this recipe. I've been making it for a year now and its just my go to recipe for any kind of alfredo. I usually make as is, but sometimes I like to marinade my chicken in buttermilk  for some extra flavor. Definitely yummy, thanks so much for sharing.

Very, very good!  My hubby and daughter both loved it.  Hubby said "Olive Garden ain't got nothing on YOU, babe!"  haha... If you like this kind of dish, give it a try, you won't be sorry.  (Bonus: Not too complicated either!)

Delicious.  Didn't make any changes and it came out perfect.  The recipe made A LOT of sauce.  I'll probably end up freezing it and saving it for the next time I want an amazing meal. :)

UH-MAZING! Every time I've made it for company I've gotten nothing but rave reviews - even my mother in law complimented me on it (which is def a big deal). Last time I doubled the recipe and froze half the sauce/chicken mixture so all I had to do was defrost it and cook up some pasta - fabulous! This is way better than at any restaurant!

I had to leave out the veggies because my company didn't like them, but this was still really good.  I am going to make it again when I can add the mushroom and tomato.

Very Rich, if I made again, think I would eliminate the jack cheese, think it would be fine without.  Was very tasty, just extremely rich for us.

Great flavor, although i did add some freshly made basil pesto to both the chicken as well as the alfredo sauch for a little extra kick..and wow! I also added some pine nuts when saute-ing the onion and mushroom mix and left out the Roma tomato, substituting for grape tomatoes (cut in half) thrown in right at the end for a little tartness. Great recipe!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  My husband, kids, and father, (who are all extremely picky) just loved it.  I was surprised by how much sauce it made.  Thinking it would be enough sauce for a box and half of pasta.  We had 5 people eating, and we had tons of leftovers.  The only thing I did differently was use one large garlic clove.  It had tons of flavor.  I will make this again and again, and would definitely recommend.

I just made this for my son's birthday party this past weekend. I ommited the tomatoes and mushrooms by personal preference and used black pepper rather than white due to what I had on hand. I also accidently added all of the garlic when I cooked the chicken because I didn't read the directions well. It still turned out fabulous! Everyone enjoyed it! I was a little nervous how thick the sauce was, but once I poured it over the noodles it was perfect! A must try!

Great flavor but needs more cheese. It was a little thick so next time I would cut back on the flour. The texture wasn't as smooth and creamy as I would have liked. I would definitely make this for company but will probably just stick with jarred Alfredo sauce for myself and Husband. Thanks!

I love using this recipe as a base for my Alfredo dishes.  As it is listed, I think it's a bit bland which is why I typically use it as a starting point and add things to it - Cajun spices, red peppers, yellow peppers, shrimp, etc.

This alfredo had a pretty good taste. Next time i think i will add a little less flour  because i felt that it was a little thicker than i would have liked it. The thing i really liked about this recipe is that the chicken is cooked seperatly and has a little flavor of it's own. It really makes the dish quite nice.

I made this last night, followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it was PHENOMENAL!!!  The flavors are amazing and the ingredients married perfectly.  The only complaint I have is that I have to work out extra today to burn off the calories... ha ha ha.  Would definitely make again for a dinner party.

What an amazing sauce!! I think it's funny I say this because I made so many changes. First of all, I halved the recipe. I didn't add any half and half and used only 2% milk. I only used 1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan and NO colby-jack. Hmmm, in fact, I didn't even add any mushrooms or tomatoes, but rather peas. I used Rotini instead of Fettuccine...lol..not a big fan of Fettuccine noodles. I added Nutmeg as a finishing touch. It was still amazing!!! Very creamy. You can probably do whatever you want with this recipe to suit your taste... my goodness this was soooo good! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really easy and delicious recipe. I made this for a ladies night event and it was the hit of the party. I substituted chicken with Salmon and it was superb. I recommend everyone to try this recipe at least once.

This is really good! I made it exactly according to the recipe and it came out wonderful. I also made it using the "To Die For Fettuccini Alfredo" recipe from this website and it came out even better. Equally, using the other recipe was a much cheaper and easier method of making the fettuccini alfredo. Whichever way you choose to make this it is really good.

Everything was really good, and I really liked the addition of roma tomatoes to the sauce (something I'm not used to in this dish). If I do it again, I think I'll cut down the amount of chicken, though. Maybe four breast-halves instead of the full six, but I prefer a higher pasta to chicken ratio.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent.  I actually made it with Bow Tie pasta and mixed it in with everything in the end.  Doing that there wasn't actually a lot of sauce like other reviews said.  The pasta actually soaked some of the sauce in and I believe made it taste better.

Really good. I used shrimp instead of chicken. I think the Italian seasoning is overwhelming, next time I will half it. Also, added a splash of white wine.

First of all I have to say that this recipe made way to much sauce. I mean a ton of it! I suspected this was going to be the case when I saw it called for 3 cups of milk. If I make it again I will use only one cup of milk. Also I thought the overall taste was a little bland.

I made it with crab and scallions.  Would probably be better with the chicken.  Will make again.

Not too shabby! I had to add a little more flower to thicken the sauce because the 1/3 cup wasn't enough. The smell of the sauce is kinda weird to me, it's the parmesan and I don't really like the smell of parmesan. But it turned out great. I also made 2 pounds of noodles because there is sooo much sauce.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I will definitely be making it again. I did leave out the tomatoes and mushrooms, since we don't like them. This recipe makes lots of sauce, so after eating dinner my family of 5 still had plenty of sauce left over. Tonight we spread the leftover sauce on a store-bought pizza crust, sprinkled with parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, baked for 10 minutes and had a delicious, quick meal. Will definitely be making this dish and the pizza again!

finally I have found the perfect alfredo sauce! I will never buy the kind in the jar again, this was delicious! I left out the italian seasonings and mushrooms (didn't have any) and used cheddar cheese instead of jack since that was all I had. I also used a small pinch of garlic salt in place of all that regular salt, I cut the recipe in half and still had enough leftover to eat for lunch today. Great recipe thank you!

This recipe was really easy to follow and turned out great! Make sure you use a good parmesan cheese and not the shredded, bagged stuff.  The only thing I would change is to add some black pepper when melting the cheeses together.  This is sure to be a crowd pleaser...it makes A LOT!!!!!

I used less sour cream than called for, less Parmesan cheese, no tomato. It was wonderful! So creamy and cheesy, but not too heavy. It did have a thick mushroom-y taste, though, which my little brother didn't care much for. BUT he still ate it and said that it was one of the best things I have ever cooked! When I tasted it I -literally- called my closest friends and made them drive over to taste it. It was that good.

My family loved this (minus the mushrooms).  The tomatoes were a nice touch.  I had never made alfredo sauce, and I couldn't believe how easy it was.  It was even better the next day after the flavors had more time to blend.  We'll definitely be making again, maybe adding broccoli.

This was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to leave out the tomatoes.  We don't care for them and they seem sort of an odd ingredient for this dish.  I accidentally cooked the chicken with the garlic, oregano and onion, but the only difference that made was to darken the color of the sauce just a bit.  The taste is still just as good.  Next time I am going to try making it with shrimp, but it is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

This had a decent taste, but I do not think that the sauce would hold up after re-heating. I think next time instead of using half and half and milk that I would use heavy cream. I'm not so sure about the colby cheese either. When this sauce cooled down, it kind of curdled a bit, which is why I do not think it would be good as leftovers.

Loved this sauce!  Wondered how it would be since it had cheese & that was new for me in an Alfredo sauce, but this was really good!  Served with a blackened chicken that was submitted by Karena here on All recipes.  YUM!  This ones a keeper!

I followed the instructions exactly as stated and it came out absolutely fabulous! I have more than enough for the next 2-3 days. The only thing is that my pasta did not cook fully but this was probably my fault. It needed about 15 minutes to cook but the instructions say 10. This meal is very tasty and I highly recommend it. The whole time from start to finish took me 40 minutes.

This was OK, but it definitely did not taste like an alfredo sauce.  I agree with a previous reviewer who thought that this was more like a chicken stroganoff.  If you are looking for a real alfredo sauce, don't use this recipe.

This was the best Fettuccini Alfredo I've ever had.  I used whole wheat fettuccini pasta and whole wheat flour and it came out yummy.  The only thing I might change is to cut back a little on the butter.

This recipe was awesome.  The only thing I changed was I added a handful of bacon bits (the soft real bacon bits, not the crunchy ones) with the onions and mushrooms. I don't think it changed the taste much though.  I made this for a birthday partyu and everyone loved this dish.

It was expensive to make, but absolutely delicious!!  I invited the whole family over and we were all stuffed.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Even better than what's in the restaurants!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe because my family of six has a large appetite,so we had lots of leftovers that actually got ate. Keeper. Though I admit to leaving out the tomatoes.

My family loved this, with a few tweaks.  I left out the mushrooms & tomatoes, and we grilled our chicken rather than preparing it as the recipe directed.  I also served it with broccoli, so it made a whole meal in a big pasta bowl.  I loved the creaminess of the sauce, but next time I'll use mozzerella instead of co-jack to lose the cheddary taste.  Overall this is a great recipe to have on-hand.

This took a long time but was really good!!  I left out the mushrooms and only used half an onion (will probably just use powder next time).  The only other thing I would change is the amount of garlic and Italian seasoning - will half these next time as well.  It makes a TON so if just making for 2 you should cut in half.  My husband loved it as did I  - will definitely make again.  Thank you!!

Pretty good...it definitely rates right up there with our local Italian Restaurants.  We left the tomatoes out and added a little more half & half to give it creaminess but all in all...very good.  We also tossed the noodles with a little olive oil for flavor.

Very, very good recipe.  Although, if you are on a diet, then I wouldn't recommend it!!  I left out the mushrooms and tomatoes (my family doesn't like them) and only used 1/2 onion and 1/2 the salt the recipe called for and it was excellent.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Very tasty.  The only thing I changed was to add blackening seasoning to the chicken instead of Italian seasoning and I threw a bag of frozen broccoli in to boil with the noodles.  Delicious!

I thought the Alfredo sauce was tremendous!  It was the best that I ever made at home.  I didn't think the chicken added anything to the recipe and plan to omit it next time.  The sauce reheated well for leftovers.

I honestly thought this chicken alfredo dish was one of the best I've ever tasted, including all of the big Italian restaurants.  I didn't alter the recipe much at all except for preferences.  Instead of fresh onion, I used onion powder and I did not use mushrooms or diced tomatoes either.  Also, I accidentally left out the ground white pepper.  The only thing I would change next time around would be to make the sauce a little more runny by adding more milk and/or half-and-half as the sauce was a little thick for my tastes.  Very good and not as complicated as it seems.  Give it a try!

This was awesome!  I tried to cut the fat as much as I could using skim milk, 2% cheese, and low-fat sour cream and it was delicious!  I will definately make it again.

This was pretty good! I didn't add the onion & small tomatoes because it just sounded way too wierd with. This was wonderful for leftovers too, I just added 3/4 cup of milk, stirred & placed it on the stove to heat. Will make again!

The first time I made it it took a bit of work, but it was worth it.  Five people live at home, and I still had leftovers for the next day.  The only thing I'd do differently is cut the recipe in half.

Excellent!  I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it.  It was pretty simple to make.  I did add more milk at the end to keep it creamy as recommended by others reviewing this recipe.  This is one recipe I will be adding to my recipe box.  Thanks a bunch Emily!

Very yummy and pretty easy to make! I'm a single with no kids 24 year old college student. I tried making this last night for my boyfriend and I. It turned out extremely well! I even overheard him bragging on the phone about how good it was! I did leave out the tomatoes and substituted black for white pepper.  This will definately be used again very soon and probably often!

This was fantastic! Much more flavorful than any other alfredo I've had! Everyone loved it! For the milk I used skim milk. I didn't have half and half so I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of skim milk. This came out so creamy. At first I thought it made too much sauce per pasta ratio but as the pasta sat and absorbed it was fine. I served in soup bowls for easier eating. Great!! Thanks for sharing!

I don't like alfredo dishes and I thought this was really good.  I made the following changes because it was all I had.  Subbed peas for the mushrooms, used regular tomato instead of Roma, used heavy cream instead of half and half, used basil and parsley instead of italian seasoning, used spaghetti instead of fettuccini.  Still turned out great!

Good.  Makes a TON.  If you're only cooking for 2 make sure to cut in half.

I thought this was very good. My 18 year old loved it, husband thought it was ok. I worked with what I had on hand. Used parmesan and asiago. Left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any, didn't have white pepper so I used a pepper blend instead.  I would leave out the asiago next time. That's all that I could figure that left a slightly sour after taste. I'll make this again (with the right ingredients!)and see if the odd taste goes away.

This recipe was delicious! I omitted the colby cheese and just did parmesan, and it was still delicious. I also added broccoli instead of the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again

WOW!  I've tried Fettuccini Alfredo many times, but this is the absolute best.  I followed recipe exactly except I used the shredded Italian blend cheese instead of the two other kinds of cheese mentioned.  I think I put too much because it was very thick.  But it was so yummy!  I will definitely make again.

This is an easy and delicious recipe to serve when you have company.  I have served it many times to family and friends and it gets rave reviews every time.  It one of the few recipes that I don't make any changes too.  It's perfect just the way it is.

I made this dish for my boyfriend as part of a three course meal- he loved it. which is saying a lot because I flat out can't cook. but this recipe was simple enough and quite tasty. The only changes I made was to add peas and bell peppers and omit the mushrooms (personal preference). I cut the recipe in half and it still made plenty of leftovers. My only "complaint" is that the sauce wasn't as thick as I had hoped... (but that may be due to my cooking abilities rather than problems with the recipe)

This was REALLY good!  I only had about 1/4 c. of REAL parm. cheese and then the rest, I had to use the stuff that comes in the green can (that still says 100% parm. cheese) and this turned out GREAT!!!  Def. a keeper and even something to serve company.

This recipe tasted pretty good...I reduced the recipe to six servings but it still ended up to be eight.  I left out the mushrooms, although I think they would have improved the dish.  I'd recommend reducing the amount of chicken, as it seemed like a lot.

Just awesome!  The best recipe I have tried in months.  I added some additional veggies and used penne instead of fettuccini.  Next time I think I will try to substitute some Asiago for the Colby Jack mix for a little more bite.

This recipe is awesome.  It was fast and easy and tasted great.  I left out the sour cream and the tomatoes, and made it for four, which made plenty.  My husband and I both loved it.  Will make this over and over i am sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I made it to the letter but next time will add more garlic and a little less milk. (felt it was a little too runny).  All in all, a great recipe!

Instead of chicken, I marinated in an Italian dressing a tender cut of beef over the spaghetti.  This is like beef stroganoff now.  I added 3/4cup more milk as it was too thick.  It's definately a keeper!

I like the flavor of this, but must have messed up the mixture along the way because the sauce felt like it was very thick and the consisteny was different. I will try to make again! Overall the taste was good, I just was not happy with the consistency! Putting more milk in may have helped that.

Tonight, I made the best Alfredo Sauce I've ever made (thanks to the recipe).  This recipe makes a great sauce as-is and is also a great base for customizing to your own tastes (e.g. I added some spicy peppers).

This was great.  My boyfriend declared it was the best ever, even over restaurants!  I used less garlic and salt and left out the tomatoes( personal preference).  It makes so much sauce that I made another batch of fettucini to use it all.  Overall, wonderful recipe.  Thanks!!

This is sooo delicious.  I really like the addition of tomatoes.  It adds a very fresh and light taste against the heavy sauce.  This makes a big pan of sauce versus the lb of fettucine.  So, you'll have great leftovers.

My family and I really enjoyed this. I used a hand full of grape tomato cut in half instead of the roma and found that quite pleasing. I also sauteed the mushrooms with my own seasonings for added flavor. I wasn't expecting the sour cream to add so much flavor! For me the alfredo flavor really didn't set in until the sour cream was added. Great recipe. Will use many times again!

This recipe was okay. I was disappointed with the results, since the reviews were so positive. I thought that the sauce was too cheesy and quite bland. If I were to make this again, I would halve (or even omit) the Colby cheese and I would add a tablespoon of Club House Garlic Plus seasoning mix. Also, I chopped up a zucchini and added that in with the tomato. This recipe was good, but I will have to keep experimenting to get it to my taste. Thanks anyway though!

I made this for 3 of us and even the leftovers were great. I added some pepper and a little more salt to my plate.  When I heated my leftovers I added old bay and that was really good as well.  Great recipe... thanks.

I was really disappointed with the results being that it had such great reviews.  The consistancy of the sauce was odd which took away from the flavor.  The only thing I can think of is that I accidentally bought fat free half & half?

This is so good!  Made one slight change...equal parts of milk and half and half.  Just halved the total amount of both needed.  Makes it wonderfully rich and creamy.  One of our favorite meals.  This is one to keep!

This is definitely a recipe I will use over and over.  A sure family favorite.  I did not use sour cream and half the salt.  I added broccoli that I had blanched when I added the chicken and it was great addition.  Next time I add broccoli I will use a little less chicken as I like it a bit saucier.

This is a good recipe, my family really enjoyed it! I didn't give it five stars because I expected a taste similiar to Olive Garden and it was more like a cross between Alfredo and the homemade sauce I use for Macaroni and Cheese. I think next time I make it I will use more half and half, skip the tomatoes, skip the cheddar/jack cheese, and use fresh garlic (I used garlic that was in a jar). Maybe add some fresh basil. I did like the white pepper.

This recipe was amazing, definatly the best alfredo i've ever had. I left out the sour cream, I dont think it needed it. Also, you need a HUGE pan to make this in. I ended up doing the chicken in one pan, and then the actual sauce in the pan I usually make pasta in (its big, i dont know the size) but definatly a great recipe!

This was very good & easy- family says it's a keeper.  The only change I made was to decrease salt to 1/2 Tbsp.  There was plenty of sauce even if you wanted to do 1 1/2 lbs of pasta.  Next time I will try adding broccoli.

This is a fantastic recipe; just what I was looking for!  I followed the recipe except for adding a little more cheese and sour cream and added cooked broccoli just before serving.
Thank You for posting this recipe Emily!

I was really scared of this recipe when I saw a lot of low ratings at the very top, but I'm so glad I tried it!  The people that gave this a low rating must not know how to make a sauce, because it turned out fantastic!  The key is constant attention.  I cooked it on a low-med heat and constantly stirred it.  The flavor was excellent!!  I added broccoli, instead of tomatoes and just loved it.  I didn't think there was too much sauce at all (we like a lot).  This one is a keeper!

The flavor was really good but the consistency did not come out smooth and creamy like alfredo sauces I have bought at the store.  Perhaps I didn't prepare it right.

Needed more chicken, way too much sauce!!  Too much flour too.  I could taste it in the sauce.  I had to add a lot of salt because it was very bland to me.  My Bf liked it though.

I agree with earlier comment about the white pepper.  This dish smelled great until I added it--then I really disliked the smell.  If I make it again I will use black pepper instead. This was my first attempt at alfredo sauce and it did turn out very smooth.

Great italian taste, not gooey as one person discribed. The roma tomato's made all the difference. Had extra sauce left. Found myself eating it straight out of the pan. Top Notch!!!

This was a little too thick and gummy. I have never heard of an alfredo sauce with monterey and colby cheese. It was good but if I made it again I would lighten it up a bit with something. Also, it made a ton of it and I have lots left over.

No offense, but I don't know how this can be called alfredo sauce. It didn't taste anything like any other alfredo I've ever eaten or made before. It was edible, but almost had a cream-of-mushroom soup type of taste to it. I expect alfredo sauces to be a little more traditional, guess I should have known when reading the recipe it wouldn't be what I expected. Highly disappointed in this and would not make it again.

I liked this receipe, but it has a strange flavor and smell, maybe it's the white pepper?  I will probably try this again with black pepper.  Because everything smelled good until I added the white pepper.

I didn't use sour cream because it was already super creamy and I think it turned out better this way. Skip the extra fat.

can i give this 20 stars? just what i've been looking for.... i'm 16, and thinking of going into culinary school, and this was perfect. took quite a while, but most good meals do...
i didn't have half and half, so i used heavy cream, and i don't think it made much of a difference. thanks! will make again and again.

I have to say that I was disappoited.  The sauce didn't come out creamy, but gritty or grainy in texture.  I don't know what caused that unless it was the parmesan cheese.  Will not make again.  Taste was just okay.
