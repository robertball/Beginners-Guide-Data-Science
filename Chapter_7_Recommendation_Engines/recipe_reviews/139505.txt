Great recipe, and I was suspicious.. I thought it seemed just too easy. 

I added a splash of tobasco sauce, some extra garlic, and a little onion powder.

This gets points for ease and high nutrition.  Use the prewashed, precut kale in a bag for added ease.  I used regular ham.  Even some of the kids ate this.  The flavor is simple, but perfect.  Sometimes there just is no need for complicated flavor when the natural flavors are so delicious.

We also had kale from our CSA and didn't want it to go to waste. This is a GREAT recipe and the first time we've had kale, what a wonderful soup. Per the other comments I added onions, garlic (before boiling the broth) and tabasco. So easy! Make sure not to add any salt, the broth and turkey ham add a lot.

I like this light soup. I use spinach instead when I don't have the kale. I also saute onion and garlic in a little butter, and then add the broth. This is something to do with leftover ham, if you don't want a heavy,creamy soup. I serve it with warm cornbread.

Just wonderful.  I did make some changes. I sauteed a coarsely chopped onion, 6 cloves of garlic and a big carrot, thinly sliced, in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Then stirred in the sliced kale.  I couldn't find turkey ham, so I bought a pound of turkey kielbasa, sliced that up and added it to the pot.  Finally, added the potatoes (I used Yukon Gold, peeled and chopped, then added sodium-free chicken broth.  We try to keep the salt down, so I used a liberal sprinkling of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute.  The result was just perfect!

Made the following changes based on previous reviews and things I could find.  Sauteed carrot, onion and garlic in olive oil before adding broth, pre-washed, pre-cut collard greens instead of kale, portuguese linguica sausage in place of ham and potatoes.  Brought to a boil and then simmered for about an hour.  Absolutely delicious, hearty, healthy winter soup.  Will make again and again.  Next time want to try chorizo when I can find it.

This was delicious. Had kale from farm CSA but didn't know how to use it. So glad I found this recipe. Per the other comments, cooked garlic before adding the chicken broth and used regular ham.

I really enjoyed this soup!  So simple to throw together, and just a few ingredients.  But the resulting flavor is so wonderful.  My whole family enjoyed it and I will definitely  make it again!

Wow! This was my first experience cooking kale, and this was very simple and tasty. I used smoked sausage instead of turkey ham because I had it on hand. Also used more garlic and a touch of Worcestershire (because I love it). No other spices needed! I only had 6 cups of chicken broth and used 2 cups of water but it was still very flavorful. This would be great with an onion!

Very good soup--it's like a simpler and more healthy version of the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden (which I make often). Like other reviewers, I'm impressed with how flavorful this recipe is. I used regular ham and added some 1% milk into each bowl to help cool it off and to give it the "creamy" look and flavor that I love. It was delicious!

It's very simple and I didn't modify the recipe besides just using regular ham.  It was pretty delicious I must say.  If I did it again, I might add onions for further flavor but it's good as is.  Will make again

Simple yet nutritious way to incorporate kale into your diet.  I've substituted turkey bacon and have prepared it without meat and it still turned out wonderfully. Great recipe!

I have a juicer and put my leftover shredded kale in to make this soup for the family since they won't drink the kale juice cocktail. It makes a thick soup and no waste for me.

I omitted the ham and halved the recipe due to a vegetarian in the house/lack of more broth.  It turned out really well-- a simple soup, not too overwhelming.  I'll definitely make this again once I run into a surplus of kale like we had this year.

Great hearty soup on a cold winter day! I had leftover ham so I used that. I didn't have 8 cups of chicken broth so I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. It was still yummy!

Not bad but not great. The flavors don't blend much, this is essentially broth with several different individual components floating in it. I added sauteed onions.

Love this recipe! It's a quick and easy and healthy too! It's a little bland with the turkey ham so I make it now with smoked ham shank. I throw the ham shank in with the chicken broth and bring it to a boil. Then I remove the ham shank and throw in the kale and potato. I chop up the meat from the ham shank and put it back into the soup and then simmer for the recommended time. Always a winning meal!

Perfect Fall recipe, easy and just a few ingredients. I did substitute Johnsonville Italian sausage, casing removed and crumbled,cooked. This works well in the slow cooker...ready in 3 hours. Served with corn muffins....Delicious and hearty!

The description of this soup is very accurate. It is simple, yet hearty. I only got about 4-5 servings, so I would probably just double the recipe next time. I used un-peeled red skin potatoes and for the broth I used 2 packets of no sodium chicken broth powder. I thought, there would not be enough salt because of this. However, with the pre-cooked turkey there is plenty. I used approximately 1/2 of a pre-cooked Butterball oven-roased turkey breast which I cubed, that I first heated in my Nu-Wave oven for 8 minutes. I have not seen turkey ham before. I am not sure the kale can really be tasted, but it does add color to the broth.

I was pretty skeptical about this... the seasoning seemed too simple for it to taste good. But it was yummy! I did make some changes... sautéed some diced carrots and onions with the garlic before adding the broth. Also added some canned cannelini beans  because I happened to have some. Warm and hearty yet light and healthy. Will be making again for sure!

The recipe is delicious as given but the cook time is too long.  45 min. to 1 hr. is plenty.  Used regular ham but didn't add it until the last 15 minutes to avoid overcooking it.  Great way to use kale and leftover ham.  So few ingredients, easy to make on a night when you just don't feel like cooking.

So simple yet so much flavor.  I did saute some onion and the garlic before adding the broth.  True, you don't need to add any salt.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, except I used chicken tenderloin and it was fabulous.  Even the kids went back for more!

Very good and easy to prepare.  My wife who is not as picky an eater as myself said that you can't leave out the ham.  Served with a multi-grain baguette.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and first sauteed the onion (and chopped carrots) in olive oil. Then added the broth, kale and potatoes. I halved the recipe and found it to be ready at 45 min (kale was done and didn't want mushy potatoes).  I used leftover chopped ham, adding it just 10 min prior to the soup being done. I've let ham cook in soup for the entire time in the past, and found it comes out dry and rubbery with no flavor. Since I had this the day after I made it, it was even better!

I too thought it was too simple to be good. It is now the version I always make.

This soup was surprisingly hearty and savory--all despite being incredibly easy.  I added a lot of paprika to mine, which gave it an extra spicy kick.  I will make it again.

Very easy and tastes good. I added 3/4 tbsp of onion powder. I added too much pepper (like a tablespoon) so don't do that :-)

One of the best soups I've made! I really think it comes down to the quality of ingredients you use. My chicken stock is made from scratch and I used ham slices from my local rancher.  I cut off the fatty bits and fried those up first in the bottom of my soup pot. They rendered nicely and I sautéed an onion in the drippings. From there I added everything else and cooked the soup for about an hour. Fantastic!

Followed the recipe, it was very good will make again with some changes to suit the family, always make it the way the recipe says then if I have to tweak it for the family I do.

We LOVE this soup. I also added chopped onion and sautéed it with the garlic before adding the broth. The first time I made it I used kale from

This is an awesome and simple recipe to make.  If you don't have your own home made chicken stock be sure to purchase low sodium chicken stock.  I used kale from my garden and red potatoes which are lower glycemic.

Easy, but very salty.
