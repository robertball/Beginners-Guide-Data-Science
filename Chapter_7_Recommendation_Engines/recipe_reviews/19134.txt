Yum!!  This was a great dish.  It was so easy. We had it with mashed potatoes and it worked great.  It made really good gravy also. The green onions really added flavor.  This was a great and easy recipie.  Thanks!!

I liked the flavor of this dish and my husband, who doesn't like chicken much, liked it.  The only thing I would do differently is cut back on the water so the sauce will be thicker.

Simple yet surprisingly delicious! I used finely chopped white onion instead of the green, sliced the chicken and served over white rice, it was absolutely great!

This was a big hit in my home.  My husband was not sure about it because it had cream of mushroom, but as soon as he tried it he loved it.  I did add just a little bit of cornstarch to gravy to make it thicker and a little less water.  It is great with mashed potatoes.

The chicken came out so tenter and soft.  It tasted ok, nothing special.  My family liked it, so i would make it again.  Instead of 1/4 cup of butter I used 1/8.  I give 3 and half stars.

We made this then shredded the chicken, mixed it back in with the gravy/sauce and served it on top of the "Classic Waffles" recipe in here. It was a really, really  good combo. I didn't add the green onion because my daughter doesn't like them. this is definately comfort food!

The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so great! I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom because I didn't have any and it still came out great. Make good gravey for the garlic mashed potatoes I served with it! Enjoyed by all.

Very easy to make.  I used cream of chicken soup (all I had on hand) and diced about 3/4 c of fresh mushrooms, which I sauteed for about 3 min. with the green onion before mixing the soup & water in.  Served over white rice.  Tasted best with lots of sauce over it.  I used 4 chicken breasts (glad I did - there wouldn't have been enough sauce to cover 6).

Friends and husband really liked this! I made it just as the recipe said to do and it went really well with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, defiantly using this one again.
