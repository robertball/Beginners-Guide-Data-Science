Nice drink but I prefer just the buttery nipple to be a pure buttery nipple. I like just the schnapps and the irish creme floating on top of my shot!

Normally, I love buttery nipples, but this recipe is not that great.  Stick with the traditional recipe of butterscotch Schnapps and Irish Cream.

My friends and I decided the remember my old bartending days by serving a few drinks at a small get-together I hosted this weekend. Although I had heard and made "slippery nipples" before, I thought this would be a neat twist and the vodka wouldn't make it as sweet (for those anti-sweet drinkers). Not true. Everyone who tried these agreed that although they were okay, the plain ol' slippery nipple was much better. Sorry but I won't serve these again.

I really love these! I like a sweeter drink, and these are really great as a winter type drink. It's like drinking flavored milk...dangerous that way also!

I've never had a buttery nipple before so I thought this was pretty good. I didn't drink it in a shot glass though..I poured it into a martini glass over a piece of butterscotch candy.

This is definitely not a "Buttery Nipple".  The Kahlua makes it a Neutron Bomb, and I have no clue what vodka makes it, but I wouldn't like it at all.  Irish Whiskey from the Bailey's and vodka don't mix well.  I think it missed the mark.  Glad other people like it, but it probably needs a new name.

Not what I'd call a "traditional" buttery nipple, with the Kahlua, but it was good & definitely sweet! A good dessert drink.

i gave 4 stars since i didn't follow directly. i didn't have coffee flavored liquor..thought i had but nope..so i just used equal parts buttershot schnapps, irish cream(Carolans was way cheaper than Baileys to use with a drink like this), and i used Kissed Caramel vodka..tasted really good to me! I'll try it with the coffee liqueur next time i get some..thanks for the ideas!

Made it with the exception of the coffee liquor and it was great.
