This was missing a lot of flavor! This recipe wasn't that great of a "healthy" modification. Save your money and ingredients and don't make this recipe. Just make Chantal's original recipe and have a smaller slice, you'll be much happier with a slice of heaven!

I have lost 150 pounds so far...and this recipe help me to stay on track.  I support this by substituting monk fruit or another all natural sugar substitute...coconut oil for the butter...add cinnamon to the crust...spread a layer of sour cream and a fresh fruit puree for dressing/garnish.  For the little I have given up...recipes like this have helped me wondrously.  Thank you for this!!

I made this recipe because I'm always interested in making recipes with nutrient modifications. 
I must say that it wasn't very good. I ended up freezing this blah-cheesecake and cutting it into little pieces to use as a topping for ice cream. If you want to make good ice cream topping, this recipe isn't so bad for that.

This is a recipe that I also created when working at a cafe. My customers wanted cheesecake so badly, but wouldn't get it because of the "lips to hips" factor. 
I admit that it is a bit blander than the original Chantal's, but you can jazz it up with a tablespoon or 2 of good all-fruit spread or toppings. 
This is definitely a good choice for someone with that craving who wants to be smart about it!
