This was easy but looked and tasted gourmet and was very juicy and tender. I may have had a smaller tenderloin so only took 45 mins to cook and let sit for 10-15 mins before slicing. I had a chive/onion cream cheese in the fridge so omitted the green onions and didn't have chopped spinach so just laid 4 fresh basil leaves over the spread and then rolled up.

I love this recipe. I made for a party of 10 (3.5lbs pork) and it turned out perfect. I made a few adjustment to what I had on hand. I added cilantro more spinach a bit more cheese. I didn't have mushrooms so I added some bread crumbs/butter. I used a thermometer and the 145 interntal temperature was ideal.

Wonderful way to make a pork 2 Lbs tenderloin. Used chorizo instead of bacon and swish and peppercorn cheese since that is what we had in stock. We also tied it up to keep it together. Took about 1.5 hours at 350. Thanks for the great tip!

This was really very good. I'd recommend seasoning both sides of the loin before stuffing and rolling. I also roasted mine on a bed of sliced onions but otherwise didn't change anything. I do feel like this recipe leaves room to modify the stuffing part but it's fabulous as is. Oh I did use some butcher's twine to wrap it up and hold it together.

I made it for our 20th wedding anniversary. I substituted out the spinach and mushrooms as my husband is not a big fan of either cooked. In their place I used a Granny Smith apple cored chopped and sausage cooked (2 chorizos patties) a little bit of very finely crushed bread crumbs mixed in with both along with the cream cheese old sharp shredded cheddar cheese.. My son opened the tenderloin up so I could put the stuffing in all of the opened area. I then carefully rolled it like a jelly roll and tied it closed. I lightly seasoned the outside with seasoned salt pepper and applewood smoke seasoning by Clubhouse. Cooked it for exactly 2 hours and it turned out perfectly I even did roasted potatoes carrots and onion with it and used the juice from the meat before hand to make gravy as there was lots.

My husband & I really liked this. It had a great flavor & was much easier to make than I thought it would be. I left off the breadcrumbs & I still think it turned out perfect

Very easy to make and tastes fantastic! I butterflied the pork as I didn't have a mallet and pressed it until it was flat. Needed to use some skewers to keep it together. Will definitely make this again:D

This was a HUGE hit at my house. I probably doubled the filling on it and I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't want to go to the store. Also skipped the breadcrumbs as we are trying to stay to low carb.:)

Made this for super last night. Daughter and her boyfriend was here. Did not tell anyone that it had spinach in it. After listening to rave reviews, finally told the secret to my family who thinks they do not like spinach. This recipe is wonderful just like it is written.
