I really like this because it's easy to throw together on a busy weeknight and it's tasty! I great use for leftover chicken too and perfect for my ketogenic lifestyle! I halved the recipe and used a 8x8 dish and it turned out awesome!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I've only recently started eating per the keto diet and have been looking for easy hearty meals and this fit the bill perfectly. I will reduce the amount of the soup base I use next time though as the product they had at our store was a bit too salty for my liking.

Assembled this the day before (without the shredded cheese on top) and refrigerated overnight. Baked the next day for about 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe called for and it came out great. I added the shredded cheese about 10 min before it was cooked. My family loved this dish.

This has to be one of the best chicken and broccoli casseroles we've ever eaten. I stuck to the recipe other than adding four slices of pepperjack cheese and then adding the cheddar on top of it. Totally satisfying and filling and keto friendly.

My entire family (ages 11 to 76) really loved this recipe. Kept it ALMOST the same adding cauliflower florets with the broccoli. I doubled the sauce to make a second smaller vegetarian version (I used cooked sweet potato chunks rather than chicken). For the chicken I sautéed 3 chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic. I threw on some shredded mozzarella and parmesan along with the cheddar on top. Will definitely make again.

Husband and I are keto but teens and grandma are not yet EVERYONE LOVED this dish! Is says it serves 10 but the 5 of us put it away in one sitting. Adding it to our list of family favorites! Only change I made was to use lemon pepper seasoning and a little liquid smoke to the sauce since I didn't have the chicken soup base.

I made this for dinner today and it was great! My family loves it. I had to make adjustments due to my many food allergies. I substituted unsweetened yogurt for the mayo and omitted all spices. (I can t have them) so my base consisted of broccoli yogurt cheese and heavy cream but it was still amazing. I had to cook my chicken separately for allergy reasons as well. My family just added theirs into the dish. Definitely making this again. I can only imagine how great this would be with the regular ingredients.

I lightly dusted cubed boneless chicken thighs with whole wheat flour & no salt "Kitchen Witch" seasoning browning first then sauteed broccoli & matchstick carrots in same pan after removing chicken. Put all together in a baking dish with remaining ingredients subbing 1/2 swiss & 1/2 colby for cheddar. This is FANTASTIC! The only suggestion would be to use yogurt in place of mayo to reduce fats.

I may have cut my broccoli too small as it was too soft. I will decrease the first bake time from 45-30 min because of that and use a mix of Swiss cheese and cheddar next time. Flavor is wonderful! We all enjoyed it!!

Holy mother of God! This is incredible. Bought an Oven Stuffer rotisserie chicken which my local supermarket sells instead of just the smaller 33oz rotisserie chickens it was 55oz. I therefore added proportionally extra heavy cream, mayo, and FRESH organic dill. Yowzers! It melts in your mouth.

Loved the dill cream sauce. Only thing I did different was to add a little chicken broth rather than soup base. I'm not actually sure what soup base was in this case so it might be intended to be the same. Then I added a little kosher salt to the cream sauce to make it pop more. Oh and frozen broccoli too. Kids and I both liked this one.

Based on the rave reviews I had high hopes when making this recipe. Unfortunately I didn't like it very much. If I am to be critical or suggest ways to improve the dish I'd start by suggesting that the amount of dill should be halved (at a minimum). As it was the dill overpowered all the other flavors.

Simple but really delicious! I made it mostly to recipe: I added some cauliflower pre cooked broccoli and cauliflower then baked for 30 min in 350 oven. We all enjoyed it even 11 month old. I was the only one on the keto diet but family friendly for sure.....

When my wonderful mother used to make this for our family when I was growing up no one cared anything about Keto and Gluten and we certainly weren't counting carbs! But it was good then and except for adding some spices this was how she made it. It's amazing you can keep your weight down eating fantastic tasting food like this. If you stay away from the velveeta and canned cheese sauces and use real cheese like this recipe calls for this is like a zero carbs main dish and that keeps you skinny. Thank you for the recipe!

Basic recipe is terrific. The changes I made  to accommodate my lactose challenges. I substituted coconut cream for whipping cream and Chobani full fat yogurt for the mayo. I didn't have fresh broccoli, so I used frozen. I had a ton of  fresh basil, so added a half cup of fresh and used Parmesean/Romano grated cheese. This recipe is very accommodating.

This dish was very flavorful. The dill and pepper contributed nicely to this. I used frozen broccoli instead of fresh and that seemed to work just as well. I also used an 8x10 casserole dish instead of the 9x13 which didn't seem to affect the cooking time. I will definitely be making this again and adding it to my repertoire of dinner meals.

Tasty but a little greasy and heavy on the dill. I would make it again but maybe use some rosemary instead of dill and try substituting some sour cream for some of the mayonnaise.

I am doing the keto diet and made this dish hoping that the whole family (spouse 2 children age 10 and 7) would also eat it. I was the only one who liked it. If you are a fan of Ranch dressing you will like it. I liked how easy it was to put together.. I used frozen broccoli florets and the store bought rotisserie chicken. I put all of the leftovers in tupperware and it reheated very well so this would be great for meal prep. I will cut down on the dill next time as it was very overpowering but it was very filling.

Just starting the Keto lifestyle. This recipe was a hit with most of the kiddos too. Can't please everyone! With just pepper and dill the sauce was a bit bland. Next time I'll add some garlic and onion powders to the sauce and see where it goes. The kids enjoyed helping to make this as it is an easy recipe.

The only change that i made to the recipe was leaving out the chicken base (because i forgot it and also the dill weed ) I added parsley flakes (same quantity as dill weed. I love this recipe and will definitely make it again! My fiancé who eats only two vegetables and is a big picky eater actually likes this dish! Way to go with Keto!

Taste great I didn't use rotisserie chicken sauteed chicken breast but it was a little too much cheese for me the cook time overcooked by broccoli. Well adjust for that next time. Is a keeper though.
