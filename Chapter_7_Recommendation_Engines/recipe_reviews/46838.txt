Oh Yum! This is a wonderful recipe. My family loves sweet potatos - even the little ones. Everyone devoured this recipe! And it is even more scrumptious with just a little butter on top. I have a sweet potato casserole I make for special occasions because it takes more time, but I honestly like this recipe better (and it's healthier than my other recipe). I love the subtle apple taste mixed with the sweet potato. The best thing about it is that it's quick and easy! I ALWAYS make my sweet potatos in the microwave, whether eating them plain or in a recipe. For this recipe, poke holes in the potatos, wrap in a paper towel, and cook about 8 minutes. Then, just scoop out the flesh and mash. It's super easy and FAST! I've always found it hard to peel sweet potatos, so the microwave is a good alternative.

I would serve this dish rather than the traditional sweet potato casseroles! The flavor is perfect though there isn't as much sugar as most pies. My husband (not a big fan of sweet potatoes) said, "This tastes like pie! and ate a large helping." I prepared the dish and sprinkled a spoonful of brown sugar, raisins, and dried cranberries on top, then placed it in a warm oven to melt the sugar. I can haardly wait to make it again!

All I have to say is YUMMMMMM.  I am a picky sweet potato eater, and all I USED to like was my Granny's sweet potatoes made with orange juice.  This was even better in my opinion.  I used brown sugar on top, as I like it sweet, and it was just right!  My son (13 mos)is a really picky eater and he even ate it.  My hubby loved it too.  THANKS!

Wowsa!!  This is fabulous!!  I bought enough sweet potatoes to try both this and Pineapple Sweet Potatoes (also found at this site)so the family could decide which one to take to Gramma's house on Thanksgiving.  I don't even think I'll be trying the second recipe...this was the bomb! I added a second apple (and used Cortlands instead of Granny Smith), and also added about 1/3 cup brown sugar.  Yum-a-liscious!!  I decided to boil them before peeling, and was surpised to find out how easily the skins slipped off after boiling.

Very, very good!  This was a huge hit with my family!  I doubled the recipie, and just eyeballed the cinnamon and nutmeg.  After mashing it with a potato masher, I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled it liberally with brown sugar and baked it in a 350 degree oven for about 20 mins.  The sugar carmelized and crusted over the top.  DELICIOUS!  It's my new sweet potato side dish!  Thanks!

I cannot say enough great things about this recipe!  It's fast, easy, simple, healthful and tasty.  I've made it with both brown sugar and white sugar and can't tell much of a difference.  Most recently I doubled the recipe, omitted the milk and GRATED the apples.  To. Die. For.  I do wish the final product looked a bit nicer, but honestly it tastes so freakin' fantastic that it doesn't matter.  Try this recipe, I promise you won't be disappointed!

We loved this! I used a golden delicious apple instead of a granny smith (I think a granny smith might be a little too tart for my tastes), brown sugar instead of white, added an extra tbp of butter & added 1/2 tsp of ginger. I started my apples when my potatoes came to a boil & took them off the heat when they were done. That way they were done when the potatos were. I skipped the milk all together...didn't think it was necessary. Thanks  Elfindancer...this was very good!

This was very good. My daughter loved it, my husband was so-so but he is not a sweet potato lover. I added a little extra butter when simmering the apples. I would not add the milk until you have begun to whip the potatos.  The apples produce some juice which adds moisture.  You run the risk of them being too watery. Add the milk later if needed.  All in all a good recipe. It had a nice sweet and tart flavor that was different than your average mashed sweet potatos.

excellent side dish...i didn't put quite as much sugar as called for and omitted the milk completely...it would have made this batch very mushy and too wet for my liking.  everyone enjoyed it, even 6 year old who has never eaten more than her "no thank you" bite of sweet potato!  will be making at thanksgiving this year.

I thought this was delicious.  I didn't cook the apples long enough that they "mashed" along with the potatoees, but I didn't think that mattered.  I liked the bite of apple flavor mixed in with the sweet potatoes.  This is wonderful and healthy on its own, but buttered, it's heavenly!

This was delicious!  The tartness of the apples (I used Empire) offset the sweetness of the sweet potatoes nicely.  I microwaved two forked sweet potatoes for about 6 minutes, then scooped them out with a spoon.  In the meantime, I put thinly sliced Empire apples in a skillet with the butter, spices, and a combo Splenda and brown sugar, and I covered it. Everything easily blended with a fork, and I didn't add the milk.  It won't be super smooth, but I liked the potato and apple chunks.

This is a nice twist on sweet potatoes from the normal sweet potatoes with marshmallows. I decided to use brown sugar in place of white sugar, I prefer brown sugar's sweetness. I used one green granny smith apple. As for simmering the apple slices, it took me almost 13 minutes on simmer and when I used a fork to pierce the apples it still had a slight firmness. I used my mixer to blend majority of potatoes, adding a little milk. I went ahead and took the advice from other reviewers and placed them together in a glass 8 x8 inch glass pan and topped it with a pat of butter and sprinkled brown sugar. I heated it at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. The sweet and tart flavors complimented the grilled pork chops. This is such an easy and delicious side dish...one I will remember next time I want to make sweet potatoes.

Family really liked it - ate it all, which is rare in our house. I used brown sugar instead of white.

This was good and healthy.  I did make some changes:  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, I boiled the apples with the potatoes and added them to the spice mixture along with the milk, I added about 1/8 cup additional milk, I added some salt, and I added about 1/8 cup of maple syrup...it seemed to need this, without the syrup it was a little bland.  Smells delicious!

I'm always looking for recipes that taste great and are good for you; this hits the spot.  I too made some minor changes, I used two macintosh apples and I simmered them with the same spices along with 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp. butter, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1 Tbl. apple cider until soft, about 15 min.  I spooned out the apples and added them to the potatoes and let my electric mixer to do its job.  I reduced the liquid until it thickened and added it to the potato mixture.  Imagine, a sweet potato dish without having to heat up the oven.  Thanks

I thought this was tastey! I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave (much less prep work this way), and also cooked the apple in the microwave. Just put the apple, butter, etc. in a measuring cup and cook for about 2 minutes on high. Simple and delicious!

My picky kids love this recipe, however I have had to make a few adjustments.  One, I usually double it and two, you have to cook the apples a lot longer in order to get them to soften.  I usually cook them for at least 20 minutes with the lid on.

An intriguing and pleasing flavor. The apples need far more boiling time, I would suggest putting them up at the same time as the sweet potatoes.

Decreased sugar by one half. Inadvertently cooked apples in a skillet instead of a saucepan, meaning I couldn't really cover with a lid while they simmered. As a result, they sort of caramelized, which added an extra, yummy flavor dimension. To soften, I put them in the microwave for 1 min before mashing. I'll probably try to repeat that "mistake."

WONDERFUL! Perfect as written, but i like to add cream instead of milk. Everyone that tried it loved it. I did have leftovers so i made a latte with about 1 cup of leftovers and 2 qt milk and a few shakes of cinnamon and some more brown sugar.. its heavenly...like liquid pumpkin pie. I also froze leftovers to make more latte later.

Easy to make and delicious.  Relatively nutritious too, if you take it easy on the butter.  I pared it down to only make 3 servings, and had to use a Fiji apple and pumpkin pie spice in place of allspice, but aside from that I followed the recipe, and loved it.

So good!  Tasted great and the apples smelled amazing.  I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely into an 8x8 dish.  The night before, I microwaved the sweet potatoes (8 minutes each), and the filling scooped right out.  (Thanks so much for that tip; I will never boil a sweet potato again.)  The next day, I prepared the apples.  I didn't have allspice, so I used a little pumpkin pie spice and a little nutmeg in place of it.  The apples softened right up in about 8-10 minutes.  I reheated the sweet potatoes in the microwave for about 2 minutes before added the apple mixture and milk.  Then I sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar on top.  I put it in the oven for a little bit just to make sure it was heated through and to keep it warm until I was ready to serve it, but I love the fact that it can be made entirely on the stovetop.  I will definitely make these again, though they may be a little too sweet for some people.

This was great and reminded me of pumpkin pie!  My 2 year old twins have been off veggies for a couple weeks but they gobbled this up and had seconds and thirds!  So anything that the toddlers like is a winner in my book.  I served it with breaded pork chops and stuffing for a cold weather treat.

This was fantastic!  I microwaved the sweet potatoes (mine took 12 minutes for two large potatoes) as suggested by another reviewer, which sped things up considerably.  I sliced the apples thin and made sure I covered the pan, but they still took longer than suggested in the recipe (maybe 10 minutes).  The recipe tasted great, but really didn't look appetizing.  I was just cooking for myself and my husband, so I put our servings in ramekins, added brown sugar and walnuts to the top, and broiled until the sugar was carmalized.  They were much prettier that way, and tasty!  In the future I may reduce the sugar used (and my sugary topping) to make it healthier. I think you could reduce the sugar by at least half without doing major damage to the flavor.  All in all, i think this is a fast, easy (especially if you microwave the sweet potatoes), healthier alternative to sweet potato casserole.  We'll definitely be making this again!

Yummy.  The apples didn't get soft in the time it said to cook them, so next time I'll probably cut them smaller and cook longer.

We absolutely love these!  I use a little vanilla and nutmeg in place of the allspice, and I throw in an extra apple...so YUMMY!  This dish also freezes well.  I usually double the recipe and freeze the leftovers for another time.  The extras are nice to have on hand for a quick meal.

These were awesome. I do not like sweet potatoes and I LOVED this recipe. These flew off of my table at Thanksgiving.

So good!  I added pecans, brown sugar and a sprinkling of marshmallows on top and baked it a little in the oven, but it's a great recipe without those extras as well.  A very durable side dish or even dessert.

What an absolutely wonderful surprise. I don't know that I'm going to make sweet potatoes any other way. Yum! My husband loved these as well.
UPDATE- I went out of town and my husband asked me to make a huge batch so he could eat it throughout the week. And then I made it again for Christmas and it was yet another hit. This is a staple for sure!

Well, this was interesting. It kind of tasted like mashed sweet potatoes blended with an apple pie, which basically it was. It had a nice flavor, but it also kind of reminded me of a sweet potato casserole without the marshmallows. This could actually be really healthy with a little Truvia vs. the sugar. I am just not sure what to pair it with. It really mainly seems like a Thanksgiving dinner side item.

This was delicious! I made it almost exactly as written, but used raw sugar instead of white sugar, and pumpkin pie spice instead of the allspice. This was all I had on hand, and it worked very, very well. I also added about 1/8 tsp of salt, or maybe a bit more, to bring out the flavors and to keep it from tasting bland. My family enjoyed this, especially my somewhat picky little brother, who told me that it was "amazing." :) Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a winner!

We really liked this and will make again.  I baked the potatoes in a microwave and scooped the flesh to save time.  I wanted a smooth puree so I used the milk (well, soymilk) and pureed with a hand-blender.  I used brown sugar because it's more flavorful and a golden delicious apple because it's what I had.  I think the Granny Smith might be better for flavor.

Delicious.  I am a fan of nuking potatoes, as someone else has mentioned themselves.  It made the recipe much quicker.  I found that it took much longer than 5 minutes to tenderize the apples in the butter mixture.  This recipe is a winner, and paired great with another recipe from this site, the maple salmon.

Very good recipe.  Since I am the only one in my household who eats sweet potatoes, I portioned this recipe into individual servings which I froze on a cookie sheet and then placed in individual ziplocks in my freezer to enjoy whenever I please.

As someone who really doesn't like sweet potatoes, this dish was pretty good.  The apple helped immensely.  It didn't taste exactly like apple pie, but then I did make a few alterations.  I put a little less than 1/4 cup of splenda with about a tablespoon of molasses.  I also added about 1/2 cup of pecans when I finished beating it.  The rest I kept the same.  Next time I might substitute unsweetened applesauce for the apples and see if that doesn't make a smoother texture.  The fact that there will be a next time is saying a lot for me!  Thank you for this recipe.  It will help me to get more of an excellent source of nutrition into my diet.

Everyone loved this one.  I really enjoyed it and I don't even like sweet potatoes.  A great recipe and much healthier than most of the traditional sweet potato casseroles. I added a small bit of maple syrup for extra flavor and it was DELICIOUS!  Thanks!!!

Awesome!! Easy too. I boiled the sweet potatoes then drained them, I left them in the strainer while I sauteed the apples. Next time I think I could even skip the butter & use a little apple juice. Then I mashed it all together, put it in an 8x8 baking dish, sprinkled a little brown sugar on top & baked for 15 minutes at 375. Didn't need the sugar but it was good! I will ABSOLUTELY make this again.

Yummy and healthy!  To take it one step further, I peeled the apples and diced them and added 1/3 cup applesauce to the apple/sugar mixture.  Once everything was put together in a casserole dish, I sprinkled a packet of Maple Brown Sugar instant oatmeal on top.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top of that and covered the top in little pieces of butter.  I baked it in the oven at 375 for 1 hour and oh my it was delicious!

This is a great way to get the family to eat sweet potatoes!  Very yummy!  I only had a Corland apple, but it worked great.  I also forgot to add the milk, but it came out fantastic all the same.  I will definately be making this again!

This was very simple to prepare and quite tasty!  To make it a little healthier I used light butter and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  It turned out a tiny bit watery...maybe I'll skip the milk next time if I use these substitutes.  My family loved it, even the hubby who doesn't really like sweet potatoes yet had a second helping :-)

this is a very simple recipe that recieved rave reviews at my xmas dinner. the addition of sweet potatoes was recent at my family dinner and this year i decided to do them differently from my mom who usually leaves them plain with marshmallows on top. the apples made my kitchen smell great and they worked well with the potatoes. this was so well liked that after dinner i only had about 1/3 of my 9x13 dish left and thats with only 8 people eating. my aunt even took some home with her! this is a wonderful recipe that i will definitely make again!!

I found this recipe delightful, light but flavorful...and not too overbearing. A good choice trying to get veggies into kids. I topped it with pecans (maybe too many but I love them) but probably wouldn't bother next time.

I make this all the time for my family.  We love it!  I usually put in more apples (any kind) than it calls for, and I use stevia to sweeten the apples (works fine).  What makes this delicious is adding splashes of half-n-half instead of milk.

Ok this is a great recipe, even though I messed up! I forgot the white sugar and didn't cook the apples long enough so I had small pieces instead of it being smooth. BUT, it was still good! Added nutmeg and ground cloves to really give the apple pie effect, but that is my own personal preference.

AH-mazing! I used granulated brown sugar instead of white and a little extra cinnamon, and the apple "smushed" right along with the sweet potatoes. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins. It honestly tasted like dessert!

These came out rather mild on my first try, but the subtly sweet flavor grew on us. It's now the most requested item on the menu!

We really enjoyed this recipe. However next time I think I will add a second apple because while this was excellent as made, it didn't taste anything like apple pie! Like another revieweer I made the sweet potatoes in the microwave. It's faster and easier and the sweet potatoes are mashed at the end anyways so it doesn't matter if they're soft when they are peeled. I used sugar substitute in place of the sugar. All in all a very  tasty dish. A definite keeper

This is an awesome recipe!  Easy & delicious, plus a little different than the normal sweet potato/brown sugar/marshmallow standby.  Will definitely make these again.

great! Microwaving the potatoes for 10 minutes saves so much time. While microwaving them, I was able to cook the apple so it is all done at the same time. I didn't have allspice. I think if I used a mixer it would have a baby food texture so I used a fork which is also less clean up. It was a good side dish for the pork chops I made.

These were delicious!  I used more sweet potatoes and apples though.  I used 4 sweet potatoes, 2 apples, and 1/4 cup BROWN sugar (just goes better with sweet potatoes).  I also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and didn't use any milk (didn't need any).  I left the peel on my apples, and would do that again!  I beat the potatoes very well (so no lumps), then added the apple mixture.  These go super well with pork tenderloin or pork chops.  Thanks for the recipe!

While no substitute for my mother-in-law's decadent-more-sugar-than-pumpkin-pie recipe for sweet potato souffle, this is a great weeknight alternative and much, much healthier.

I just tried this yesterday for Thanksgiving.  My family hates sweet potatoes but I keep trying every year to find something to make with this vegetable.  THIS IS IT!!  In fact, we voted to add this delicious recipe to our rotation of everyday side dishes!!  I made 2 small dishes of it, and topped one with marshmallows.  Everyone loved BOTH.  Thanks for this great easy recipe.

These were unreal! And so easy! I microwaved the sweet potatoes because the oven was being occupied by the turkey. The apples needed to simmer for a bit longer than this recipe says to get soft. I used Braeburn apples, they cooked up perfectly. I used a more cinnamon and nutmeg instead of allspice because I didn't have any. Once they were done I just threw it all together and used my handheld mixer to combine everything. There were perfectly sized chunks of apples, and they REALLY complimented the potatoes! I was pleasantly surprised! I will make this again every year. My husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes ate two helpings! Great EASY recipe! Thanks! My new Thanksgiving staple...

Pretty good, although the tartness of the granny smith apple didn't seem to fit. It could be because I didn't use the amount of sugar called for - I only used 1 tbsp brown sugar.  Also, only a pat of butter, and used rice milk instead of regular milk. It did satisfy my sweet tooth though, and I served it with ginger ice cream.

Very good recipe. I leave out the milk and substitute 2 T. of honey for the sugar. Microwaving the sweet potatos is the way to go - boiling them leaches the nutrients and lessens the flavor. If I didn't have a microwave, I would bake them instead of boiling.

I have been trying for years to get my kids to eat sweet potatoes.  They have hated every attempt until this one, which they actually enjoyed.  So did I. I left out the milk and it was juicy enough without it.

This is pretty good!  My two year old loved it.  Definitely a good alternative to just a baked sweet potato, and a good choice when you want something a little sweet and creamy but don't want all the calories and fat of the true sweet potato casserole.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to microwave the sweet potatoes and use non-dairy margarine instead of butter since my son is allergic to milk.  I used the mixer to get it pretty smooth, just a few small apple chunks were left.  This was so yummy!  Everyone in my family loved it and had seconds and thirds!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the recipe in half and sort of estimated on all the ingrediants. I also cooked the potato in the microwave then smashed it all up with a fork. Really nice on a cold day! I'd never tried to add apple before and I love it.

i am always looking for healthy sweet potato recipes, not laden with sugar,cream, and the like. well, i have found that in this recipe!  this was a great treat and just the right amount of sweet to make me think i was having a "dessert"  The apple was the perfect touch to the taste of this dish. this is another one of those recipes that is super easy to put together...i mean easy!

I love experimenting with sweet potato recipes.  I made this for Christmas and it was a nice twist to the usual sugar filled recipes.  I used brown sugar in place of white.  I'll probably make this again later after I experiment with others.

I have never had sweet potatoes this way, or with apples at all. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was! The flavors are perfect together, and it does taste like dessert, but still excellent for a side dish. I will definitely make this again, thanks!

This recipe was pretty good, it wasn't as great as I was expecting based on the other reviews.  On the good side, it is a fast and simple recipe and smells heavenly.  On the bad side it is a bit mealy and doesn't look very pretty (turns a brownish color).  The taste is good, but not great.  I would recommend this recipe to sweet potatoe lovers that like a sweetened dish but I will not make this recipe again for us.

Made this wonderful dish for Thanksgiving. However, we substituted the milk with Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum and even drizzled a little more on top before putting in the oven to heat. Was great. Next time I plan on doing some roasted pecans, granola and butter for a crunchy top.

Even my 2 and 4 year olds ate this (with some butter mixed in).  So, it gets a 5 from me.  I didn't have a granny apple, so used golden, but we all liked it and will make again.  Great with pork!!

I used frozen diced sweet potatoes as a shortcut, and mashed everything with my potato masher.  I didn't want to add extra sugar on top, so I just substituted about 1/2 brown sugar for the white sugar.  It was great and my kids loved it. Will definitely make it again

I made this for my family and  everyone really liked it alot.  i would recommend doubling the recipe as there wasn't enough 'sauce' when i completed the dish.  great side dish, healthy and something a little different!

I used brown sugar instead of white...and used a bit more than 1/4 c. because my husband likes sweet potatoes with lots of sugar.  Very tasty, good recipe.

This recipe was easy to prepare.  It made for a delicious side dish.  I followed the directions exactly and agree that it almost tastes like apple pie.  Thanks for a nifty recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  I love it as did my family.  This will be my "standard" way of fixing sweet potatoes in the future.  I cooked the apples a little longer and whipped until smooth. Flavor was awesome!!

Very easy. I like the taste of brown sugar in my sweet potatoes, so I used that instead of white sugar. I omited the milk and added 1 tbsp of apple juice to the apples while cooking. After mixing I put in a casserole and topped with marshmellows and dotted with butter baked at 350° untill marshmellows where melted(about 25min).

This is one of my favorite vegetables now! It's so yummy. The first time i made it, i had to mix apples sepately b/c they weren't as soft as sweet potatoes, but second time i cooked apples about 15-20 mins and then everything was easy enough to smash w/ a fork. You can also pour in casserole dish and add marshmallows like sweet potato casserole but we like it plain as it is just as good and healthy for you that way.

These were very nice...a good idea...and simple.  It is a bit hard to dice huge, solid sweet potatoes; if you have the time you can boil them just cut in half for 30-40 minutes, and it works the same.  Sure enough someone in my family said "This tastes like apple pie!"  Definitely healthier than it, though.  If you like sweet potatoes at all, try it.

This was very good if you're looking for a twist to sweet potatoes! They really did taste like apple pie - almost like pumpkin pie to me.  I used heavy cream instead of milk, and also added 4 TAB butter, 1 cup chopped pecans, and 3/4 cup packed brown sugar.  I also did sprinkle in some cloves and nutmeg. Everyone remarked how great they tasted! We actually ate more of them as dessert than as part of our dinner!

I made this as an Easter side dish. My husband gives this five stars. I sprinkled brown sugar at the end as was suggested and I think that made this recipe even better.

Made this for the first time for Christmas dinner.  Everyone raved over this dish!  Four out of the 5 women there asked me for the recipe.  My husband always skips the sweet potato dish but after all of the raving over this, he even tried and liked it.  Will definitely make it again.

Since Thanksgiving was all adults this year, I substituted apple brandy for the milk.  The brandy was too strong at first, so I measured 1/2 cup and boiled it down to 1/4 cup, added the butter, spices and sliced apple, then cooked the apple slices.

I made this tonite to go with meatloaf and broccoli.  It was very good, next time I make it I will cut the apples slices in half. Smaller pieces will make the apples cook a lot faster.

No sugar. Cut the allspice and cinnamon in half.  The flavors were nice and subtle; could still taste the apple and sweet potatoes.  Any more spices would have been too much.

Excellent recipe.  Would probably make a nice pie filling.  I may investigate.  Will also try it out in the slow cooker.

I made this a few days ago for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I wasn't planning on making it but it was really easy to make and I already had all the ingredients on hand so I just decided to go for it. I loved it and I'll definately make it again because it take so little time and effort and the results are very good.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I love sweet potatoes - my hubby not so much, although I said he liked this recipe.  I made it following the directions, no modifications, and it turned out really good.  Definitely going to make again, although probably only during the fall and winter.

I was looking for something different as an anniversary dinner. I made this dish with roasted red pepper, broccoli and oven-roasted chicken. I was not sure what sauce to use with the chicken, so I made a simple garlic/butter sauce that was complimented by the potatoes perfectly. My boyfriend loved this dish - he said there was such a great mix of flavours and begged me to make it more regularly!

Great recipe! I don't think I cooked the apples long enough because they didn't mash very well. Otherwise its very tasty.

This was really good - exactly what I was looking for: semi-sweet but also tastes super healthy. I used 1/4 C brown sugar instead of 1/2 C white, and probably more like 1/4 C milk. I also added about 1/4 C applesauce, because I wanted to make it a little sweeter (since I used less sugar) and also thinner. Also about 1/2 tsp salt. I love it, but I think following the original recipe would garner superb results as well.

I thought this was very tasty.  My 3 year old loved it and had 3 helpings.  I didn't use any milk and used sweetener instead of sugar, also added a sprinkle of nutmeg.

Excellent recipe! Now I understand the rave reviews!  I was planning to make a casserole with my leftover baked potatoes, but this was much better.  Did not need the milk, used brown sugar & only about 2 Tb., did add some toasted coconut for topping.  I just used a fork to combined, liked the bits of apple & potato.  Will definitely make again & again.  Might try throwing in some quick-cooking oatmeal before mixing, too. Thanks for this recipe!

Sweet potatoes aren't really popular where I live, but they're change from regular potatoes and really healthy. I really like this recipe, I wasn't interested in the marshmellow ones.

Pretty good! I put a good a good helping of brown sugar in in and a little nutmeg with the cinnamon and the flavor was just lovely. Didn't have granny smith so i used some kind of french apples.. texture was a bit stringy for some reason, but I still might make it again.

Love the flavor. I'm glad to finally find a recipe like this that does NOT have marshmallows on top. I love to make lots & lots of this & have the extra for lunch time side dishes during the work week. ONLY DOWN SIDE is that even though the food is literally STEAMING when served, it gets cold really quickly.

I've made this recipe several times lately.  It is an easy, healthy fall side dish.  I had to double the recipe to feed my family.  I took the tip to microwave the sweet potatoes for 8 min and scoop out flesh.  This is a very easy way to bake them!  The first time I didn't have granny smith apples (I don't remember which kind I had) and it still came out great.

This is a great recipe. The only change I would make is to boil the potatoes on one side of the stove while doing the apples on the other. BOTH take @ 15 minutes  to be ready to mush. I also added marshmellows on top to make it pretty for the kids. My 4 year old said she didn't like sweet potatoes but after 1 spoon asked for a bowl. just the right sweetness. These would be good with pork and ham too!!

GREAT tasting potatoes! I didn't have "Granny Smith's" so I used Fuji, I just used a little less sugar. It was GREAT! My husband & daughter loved it as well so I'll be making it again in the near future! Thank You for the recipe!

We had a cooking day during my peace corps training in peru, and we all brought in recipes to make.  I decided on this recipe because all of the ingrediants are really plentiful and inexpenive here.  It turned out sooooo well, and everyone (both peruvian and american) wanted the recipe.
A total success!
thanks!

Very easy recipe, and wonderfully simple to modify. I think the one thing the recipe lacks is a call for salt. Obviously, you can do this after completing cooking - just salt to taste. 

I think this would be fantastic if you threw in some carmelized onions, or little boiling onions. Will try next time.

Although my husband claimed to like it, the rest of this found this very bland and not very good.  We all love sweet potatoes so had thought it would be impossible to not be a winner - but unfortunately, was not so good.  The apple also takes much longer than the 5 minutes to soften.

PERFECT! My boyfriend and I spent our first Easter together with his family.  We all brought a dish, and this was a hit!  It was SO yummy.  I just wish I had made more. The serving size is small for 6 people.  Thank you!

I doubled the recipe and it turned out wonderful. I served this with a ham for Christmas and everyone raved about it. The pork and the sweet potatoes complimented each other nicely. This is a keeper.

This was great! I tried it for the first time for Thanksgiving and for the first time ever, the sweet potato dish was emptied! I used Rome apples because I new that they would cook down well and be much easier to blend in. Substituted Splenda as well. Everything came out great!

i guess the taste didn't work well for me. the apple did not go with the sweet potatoes and most of all, it's too sweet for my liking. i guess it's personal preference when it ocmes to this dish. nonetheless, it's definitely easy to prepare.

This recipe was fantastic!  Not only was it a hit with the fam, but I used the leftovers to make bread.  (used a pumpkin bread recipe and subbed leftover sweetpotato mixture for pumpkin)  My 8 yr. old said that this was her NEW fav. bread!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Looked very strange but tasted great. :)  This is a keeper.  I went for the 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed, as my husband and I like it nice 'n sweet.  We had a little extra as our main course instead of a side dish and thought that was yummy!

What an excellent substitution to the high fat, high calorie sweet potato casserole!  We're adding this to our holiday traditions!  Delicious!  

Note: Even our sons who aren't big on sweet potatoes love this one and came back for seconds!

This ia a fabulous recipe and really easy. It tastes nothing like apple pie though. In fact, I couldn't even taste the apple. I used another tart apple because I didn't have a granny smith on hand. I think maybe I'll use more apples next time. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the sugar the recipe asks for. I think the brown sugar is better with the sweet potatoes than all white. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I know most reviewers loved this recipe, but neither I nor my family liked it very much. As one reviewer suggested, I cooked the apple longer than the original recipe to make sure it was soft enough, but I still found the texture of the dish to be mealy. And so much cinnamon and allspice left a grainy, sandy texture to it as well.

This was a good recipe but not as good as all the other reviews made it out to be.  It essentially tastes like sweet potatoes mixed with homemade applesauce not apple pie.  I'll probably make it again but it's not what I expected.

What a great sweet potato dish. The only things I did different was I used 2 apples, and instead of just white sugar I used 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and a few tsp of white sugar. As for the spices I did the tsp of cinnamon with 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of allspice. I used my hand mixer to mash the potatoes and apples. I am so glad I decided to give this dish a try. Perfect for this time of year!

This is my husband's favorite ever since I made it for Easter. The first time, I prepared it exactly from the recipe. The next time, though, I used one large can of sweet potatoes, a bit of extra brown sugar, and used cider instead of cream or milk. Delicious! The masher gives just the right size of apple bits.

I prepared this early in the day (using 3 Tbls. of butter).  I cooked Honeyed Pork Chops (from this site).  20 min. before the chops were done -I took a reviewer's advice and sprinkled on brown sugar and raisins and put  the potatoes in the oven (covered).   I served corn on the cob with this.  It was a very pleasant meal.  Definitely kid friendly!

What a recipe!  Do not hesitate to make this.  I know everyone says this, but my picky 7-year-old son just tried one bite and then asked for a bowl of it.  (He has never eaten sweet potatoes until this recipe.)  This dish does taste like pie.  I used twice the amount of sweet potatoes (about four medium), but used only one tablespoon of butter and 1/4 cup sugar.  I didn't have a Granny Smith apple, but used three small McIntosh.  This is so good!  What a great idea to combine apples with sweet potatoes.

My family really likes this recipe.  Even my young sons who don't like regular sweet potato recipes like this.

Really good.  I thought for how easy it and the fact that it took half the time to cook as a casserole it was great.  I also enjoyed the fact that it was much lower in calories and fat then a casserole.  However, If I wanted to indulge, I would still stick with the sweet potato casserole!

Everyone raved about these sweet potatoes.  I topped it with marshmallows and all the kids liked it too!
