I thought this recipe was great. I only used 3/4 tsp of chile powder in response to one of the comments. I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg 1 tsp sugar and 1/4 tsp salt. I also only used yellow raisins and did not add currants. I put everything for the sauce in my food processor to make it more of a liquid. The sauce had a great flavor and my guests loved it. The chicken turned out a little dry but it was good after I shred it and mixed it with the sauce. I had plenty of sauce for the amount of chicken.

This recipe is one of our favorites. We make it for parties and our friends go crazy over it. I have never seen currants at the store, so I use 1/3 cup currant jelly instead, and I use cherry crasins (cranberries) or a rasin cranberry blend instead of just rasins.

After 5 hrs cooking on low I was able to shred my chicken with a plastic spoon....so I don't think that there's a need for 11-12 hrs. It was delicious! Left out currants added sugar and nutmeg after reading all the reviews.....it's a keeper!

I love mole and this was my first attempt. I only made 4 servings and it didn't seem that the conversion made for enough sauce. I added some extra tomato sauce and chicken broth near the end. It didn't need the whole 10 hours to cook either. The taste was very good though. I used all raisins since I didn't have currants. My 16-month boys ate it heartily. Will make again.

If you are looking for your Super Bowl party meal this is it! I made this today but used 3.5 of bone in pork butt. I subbed enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and added 4 chopped canned chipotles in lieu of hot sauce. I have been told this is the best pork I have ever made. After 11 hours in the slow cooker I removed the bone and chunked the pork by breaking up the pieces. I prefer this to shredding because it allows the sauce flavor to seep into the meat. I served with soft tacos pico de gallo and diced avocado sprinkled with lime juice and some salt. It was excellent! If you are expecting a thick mole sauce this isn't it but you could remove the meat and thicken it I am sure. Excellent recipe. Thanks so much!

I have long wanted to make mole but every recipe had over 25 ingredients and took forever to make. with just a few small changes this was 5 star! I put the chicken in frozen (helped to keep it tender) added a couple chipotles in adobo and I didn't have sesame seeds so I added a tablespoon of sesame oil. Near the end I took the meat out and shredded it and blended the sauce until smooth. I have found the perfect recipe for our home! Thank You

This was really good! Only reason not giving it five stars is because a little more chocolate flavor in the mole would have made it perfect for us. Still considering the ease of prep I can easily remember next time to add more cocoa powder for personal preference. Thanks!

sorry this is not chicken mole -- compare with the color texture and flavor of even the store-bought mole sauces from the latino section of your local grocery store -- this isnt even close nor do believe i can use this recipe as a foundation to improve upon so looking for another...

this was delicious with a few additions/changes. i upped the comino and cinnamon to 1 tsp. of each and added 1/4 tsp. each of ground nutmeg and dried cilantro. try adding 1-2 tbsp. white sugar for a little sweetness to the sauce. i would definately recommend pureeing the sauce in a blender before adding to the crock pot with the chicken to make it smoother and thicker.

My first attempt at making mole. It was good. I appreciate that it didn't include high fat ingredients like lard. This was pretty quick to prepare which is a plus. I'll definitely try this again and maybe use tablets of Mexican drinking chocolate next time.

This was a very good recipe! Very easy to make. I left out the currants because my grocer was out. I added more hot sauce and served it on a warm tortilla with sour cream.

This was my first try at mole and my we loved this recipe! I added an extra cup of water at the end of the cooking time along with a few smoky dried ancho chilies and cinnamon sticks. I served it with garlic rice and it was a very satisfying low fat meal.

You definitely need a spice grinder to do this recipe with the whole spices. The whole flavor of this dish was not what I expected at all. It tasted nothing like the Mole at a Mexican restaurant. I was pretty disappointed.

I loved it but I am a chocolate and cinnamon addict! I have never made a mole sauce before so am not the best judge. However I admit to a major embarrassment: Once I began cooking I discovered I had NO chocolate powder and even NO mexican chocolate (that I often use in my chili recipes). So I got really creative and daring and I added you guessed it some Hershey's chocolate syrup!!!! I know...big YUCK. But strangely it still came out tasting divine. I would recommend trying it sometime if you are stuck w/o chocolate. I mean yes it made it sweet but many reviewers said to add some sugar. Hope the culinary police don't arrive on my doorstep - my defense will be "It is good to use what you have..." on the other hand it is also "Good to plan ahead.";-)

I was impressed with how easy this was to make! Next time I will double the tomato sauce and will be a little more heavy handed with the spices. I served this with vegetarian baked beans...the flavors worked well together.

Pretty good definitley need to blend sauce before adding shredded chicken. Not as good as the clasic time consuming recipe but it will do in a pinch.

Good. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones and it was pretty liquid - should have put rice in with it.

Followed the recipe to the letter just wasn't our cup of tea. Too many other ways to make chicken in the crock pot we would rather have.
