I've always wondered how to make that meat that they use in gyros, and I'm glad that I found this recipe. The meat in the gyro "kits" that I usually buy is SO greasy, that I would only buy them on a rare occasion. I really enjoyed making these, and knowing what was going into it. I did need to bake it for close to an hour and a half to get to 165 degrees. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I made Tzatziki Sauce I (also from this site), and they turned out really good. Thanks for sharing BetterCookingForSingleFathers!

Made this for Sunday dinner.  Super easy to mix up the meat ahead of time and keep in fridge.  We used lamb and lamb sausage instead of beef.  Turned out spicier and the three teens loved it.  Food processor gave it the perfect texture.  Family asked that this be added to the â€¦"Make all the time list".

Used main recipe and made it as a Greek salad instead of gyro roll. Was very good, but need suggestions to "spice" meat up a notch.

Turned out perfect! Only thing is that I had to cook it for 1 hour, 15 minutes to get it fully cooked.  Friends loved it too!

My family enjoyed this and the meat texture is perfect.  If I were to make again I would definitely kick up the seasonings a few notches.

TOO Good! Now my family wants them once a week. I make them with stuffed grape leaves as a side. Yummy!

Tasty. I replaced the meat with tempeh.

I am making it right now...a little concerned about the pan. I could not find one that measured 7X4...I feel like I packed it in there. I put it in a meatloaf pan.

How long did you wait before cutting it? I hope it turns out!   Okay here it is...Turned out and the family raved about it. I used 2lbs of Lamb and one lb of Italian sausage, mild. Followed recipe other than that. Thank you so much.

I did not put the loaf pan in a roasting pan with water because my loaf pan is a porous Pampered Chef loaf pan and I was afraid it would be soggy.  So I am assuming that the texture is different.  That said I am very pleased with the spiciness and flavor of this recipe.  So exciting to be able to make this at home.  Will have to get a regular loaf pan to follow it exactly.

Came out fantastic.  Couldn't get the lamb this time so doubled the beef.  I can't imagine how much better it would have been with the lamb.
