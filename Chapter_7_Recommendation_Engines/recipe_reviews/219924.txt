I use a simiar recipe for chiken but I also add 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke and two teaspoons of chopped jalepeno peppers.  It's addictive!

Simples ingredients. Who doesn't love wieners, bacon and sugar? Perfect combination of sweet and salty. I made a double batch of this recipe cause one package of the little smokies looked too small. Glad I did. I brought them to a Memorial Day BBQ and they were all gone in less than an hour! The longest step is wrapping in bacon but it's the most important step. I liked adding the toothpicks cause it does help keep the bacon on and easy to pick up out of the slow cooker when at a party. Not sure why someone gave it a 1 star. They were really vague with their reasoning for the 1 star. People need to give more specifics when they review recipes or they're review really isn't all that effective for other homes cooks. I'd disregard that review entirely. These are a keeper if you like mini wieners and bacon!

Really good. My son seen me dumping the soda in the crockpot over the smokies and he was convinced that I had just ruined them. Silly boy. These didn't last long at all. And my son loved them.

This took a bit of prep work, but that could be done the night before. It tasted amazing and everybody loved it.

I have relied on allrecipes for years to find and cook great meals and as ppetizers. This one looked fantastic. I followed The directions to the letter. I did not care for this recipe at all.
