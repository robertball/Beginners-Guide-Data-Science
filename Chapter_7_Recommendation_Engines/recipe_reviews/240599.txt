The flavor was really good, but of course, this will only be as good as the salsa verde you use and the cut of pork.  I used Salpica brand Cilantro Green Olive Salsa with Charred Tomatillos which had medium heat.  Against my better judgement, I followed the recipe and used pork loin. For roasts that need to be pulled, you should really use a fattier cut such as pork butt, shoulder or ribeye.  Pork loin will not pull well because it lacks fat and, more importantly, collagen, so you end up with dry meat.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it smelled delicious while cooking. I will definitely make this again, although next time I'll use a different roast. Super easy recipe for a busy week day.

I’m surprised a recipe this easy and this delicious isn’t illegal.  I’ll be honest, I didn’t even bother to brown the pork roast or do the extra step of shredding then putting it back in the crockpot.  I simply cooked it for the total amount of time and then shredded.  I used a friend’s homemade green salsa which could been one reason it was so wonderful.  It just doesn't get any easier or tastier than this.

It doesn't get any simpler than this, and for the ease of cooking, the taste is great! I did not worry about browning my loin in oil; I just put it in the crock pot, made a few cuts in the loin to let the flavor of the salsa in, and let it cook on low for 8 hours. It was perfectly shreddable once I got home from work, and made a great dinner with some taco shells and accessories!

Another meal everyone liked and I have 3 picky teenagers. I added some cumin and paprika and made it into enchiladas. Covered with more salsa verde and cheese and it was phenomenal. Will definitely make this again.

Super easy! I did brown the pork loin in a frying pan first to sear all sides. I had a rather large 5 lb roast, so I used an entire 16oz bottle of Herdez Salsa Verde. Delicious and tender.  Husband loved it too. We are enjoying tacos, burritos, and enchiladas!

This pork recipe was very tasty and super easy! I put my pork in the crock pot straight from the freezer before going to work and it came out moist and not dry at all, but I do wish I had let it thaw so I could have seared it as directed. It was good on its own, and just as good in tacos.

This is excellent!  I copied from one of the comments--threw the roasts on the barbecue to sear as I made dinner the night before!  Had plenty so served it one night as burritos and another over rice.

Second time I made it I used a different salsa-not nearly as tasty-I recommend that you use La Victoria Thick and Chunky Salsa Verde for both better flavor and texture.

This was very easy & good.  I cut the pork loin into 2" pieces & through it in the crock pot.  I have a dutch oven but it's so darn heavy I opted to set it & forget it.  This was very easy & carefree & shredded very easily.  If you want an easy, no hassle recipe, this is for you.

This turned out wonderfully. It can't get any easier. Loin roasts tend to be dry, this wasn't. Slow cooker pork BBQs tend to be soggy, this wasn't. It's a leaner cut, so it's lower fat. The salsa verde is a nice change from the typical Carolina style. If anything, next time I may add a few drops of liquid smoke to the salsa and I may try a premium brand salsa.

We enjoyed this very much. I added a couple extra things, such as more salsa verde even though I had closer to two pounds of meat.  I seared the meat and put into slow cooker along with a chipotle pepper in Adobe sauce (trying to clean out fridge), dried oregano, and cumin. 
After 5 hours on low, the meat was still very tough so I couldn’t shred it, but pulled it apart in a few big pieces. I was planning on going a full 8 hours total anyway. It ended up being tender and flavorful. It was on the “warm” side of spicy, but my husband liked it and he doesn’t like spicy food. 
A keeper.

I messed up and it was wonderful. I only had 1.5 lbs of pork stew meat. I used a 10oz can of Green Enchilada sauce, one small can green chilies, mushrooms, onion, jalapeno, garlic and chili powder In crock pot. When the meat was tender, line casserole dish with browned corn tortillas, layering sauce, cheese and meat mixture. Top with cheese and bake @ 350 until cheese melts served with pinto beans and Spanish rice.

This was so good. I was skeptical especially since it calls for green salsa, but I did it and it was pretty freaking good. I only had a 2 lb pork loin roast on hand and I had a 7 ounce can of Herdez salsa verde, which was enough to cover the roast. It smelled amazing while cooking and once it was done, I couldn't stop eating it. It was really good and will totally make this again soon.

Easy, tasty and versatile.  I made this dish for a party and served it with corn tortillas and various filling options.  They were a hit!  It was a great option for the not too spicy fans.  I used the left overs to make enchiladas and as the recipe promises the flavor is even better the next day.

So simple I almost didn't make it but am so glad I did.  We grilled out the night before so I threw the pork on the grill to get a bit of smokey flavor then finished it in the crackpot. Served it with  avocado, feta cheese, romaine and salsa.  placed some warm corn tortillas on the side and the whole family got quiet, always a sign of a good meal.
