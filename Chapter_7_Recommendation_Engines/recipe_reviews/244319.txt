This drink was very good and my sister and I loved it. We were having a great drink while talking to each other. I do recommend this drink. I will try it again soon.

I made this for myself and my 4 siblings! They absolutely loved it, my step-brother had 3 glasses! I did add a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream so that it wouldn't be super runny! Topped it off with some Whipped Cream, and drizzled with some Hershey's syrup. We will definitely be making it again!
