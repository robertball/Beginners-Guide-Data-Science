This was delicious! Everyone loved it.  I used fresh sliced peaches instead of diced canned peaches.  The dressing is very light and yummy. It would be a great main dish salad for a ladies luncheon.

This recipe was ok.  We found it lacked crunch so I added some slivered almonds.  My kids didn't like it, and my husband put his in a wrap and ate it that way.  I probably won't make it again unless I need to change things up a lot.

This salad is absolutely delightful!  It's a light salad that's not only delicious, but nutritious.  My friends were "wowed!" by this salad. They deemed it a welcome change from the usual and very tasty. Great salad to have when guests come to your garden party.  This will be on my most loved recipe list!  I did not alter this recipe at all.  I will note, though, that I used Boar's Head Smoked Virginia ham...it was perfect.

This is positively yummy!  My three children loved it and so did my husband.  The only thing I did differently was I forgot the cantalope but despite this it was awesome.  I will definetly include it next time.  My children really enjoyed hunting through all the different ingredients though there wasn't anything left in their salad bowls later.  They request this often.

Very good! Especially liked the dressing. Made this for lunch with my visiting parents(my guinea pigs). My mom had two helpings(she eats like a bird)! Would be great made with chicken too. Also, I subbed plums instead of peaches b/c my dad doesn't care for them.

Very good salad, but next time I think I'll use a mix of spinach and romaine and maybe add some toasted slivered almonds. I would also be a bit more generous with the mustard when preparing the dressing. Use a fresh peach if you have one, in spite of all the ingredients, the flavor of that ripe peach was a delight. All in all, we enjoyed this salad.

We recently made this for 85 women.  We used fresh strawberries, blueberries and roasted pecans primarily because those fruits were in season.  It was a beautiful plate to serve and the taste is wonderful too.
