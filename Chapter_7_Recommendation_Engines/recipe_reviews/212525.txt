All the spices need to be doubled in this.  This makes A LOT too, and feeds more like 8 or 10.  I couldn't find the garlic paste so I just made my own and use 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves in place of the whole cloves.

It turned out alright, a tad bit dry. You NEED to have a nice curry dish along with it or its rather meh.
