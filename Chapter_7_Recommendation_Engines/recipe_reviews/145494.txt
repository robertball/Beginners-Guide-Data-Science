I bought some black eyed peas at the farmers market today so I thought I'd give this recipe a go.  It was very tasty!  I touch rich for my blood but good none the less.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

We made this last night and thought it pretty tasty, even though I messed up and processed all the peas!  The only thing that will probably keep this from becoming a regular dish for is that it takes a little longer than we usually spend on an evening meal.

We both loved this just the way the recipe was written, except using dried, cooked black eyed peas instead of canned.

This is one of my favorite things to make.  It's so rich and hearty!  For any vegans/vegetarians out there, you can veganize it!(gasp).  Make a vegan pie crust, use vegan sausage (Field Roast is my favorite), omit the cheese, or add vegan cheese (even  without the cheese, it's still rich and delicious), use unsweetened, unflavored soy or almond milk, and omit the egg, which really isn't necessary.  It's just as delicious as when I used to use meat.  No kidding!

I have been making this since 2001 and the only thing I do different is I add a handful of fresh cilantro with the spinach in the food processor.  I love this recipe and everybody I've made it for always begs me to make it again.

Fantastic recipe! Perfect on a cold winter's night. I am not terribly fond of black-eyed peas, but every New Year's Day, the husband insists. This was a great find as it's a one dish meal and keeps everyone happy. This will make it to our table many more times than New Year's Day!

Everyone loved this recipe - hubby and kids (teenager all the way to a four-year-old) couldn't stop eating this.  I made two pies and they finished them both :)  I didn't use canned peas, I used frozen and slow cooked them overnight adding my own seasonings.  I was hesitant at first, but after my teenager said that this is a dish I should bring to our big family Thanksgiving dinner because everyone would love it, I knew it was a keeper.

One of the best recipes I’ve ever made and definitely a new tradition! The only things I did differently were to use vegetarian “beef” crumbles instead of chorizo and I mixed the mushrooms in with the “beef” mixture instead of adding them as their own layer. Sooooo delicious!!

This is pretty unremarkable.  It was a lot of trouble and really wasn't that good.  It wasn't bad....but a grilled chorizo with blackeyed peas on the side would have been better.

One of the most amazing dishes EVER!!! I don't like using canned vegetables so I soaked my own peas overnight and cooked them myself.   I used 4 links of chorizo which is about 12oz.   I also cooked the chorizo by itself until it was almost done. Then I drained and rinsed it with warm water to remove a lot of the grease, then added the cooked onion as well as the jalapeño and finished cooking. It removes most of the grease without compromising the flavor. Then I made my own crust. It turned out wonderful!!!!  I took it to work with me and my co workers devoured it, and all of them asked for the recipe.  I printed it out for all of them and just put my changes in some notes at the bottom.  I also gave it to a few clients, one of which does a lot of entertaining and she has served it a few times with rave revues.

I made this with a few lighter tweaks, light cream and half fat cheese and slightly less than called for. Also added garlic to the mushrooms and made it with a bottom light wholewheat crust only, sprinkled a bit of cheese and smoked paprika on the top and baked it like a quiche. My husband and I both gave it top marks, wonderful. I will certainly make it again.
