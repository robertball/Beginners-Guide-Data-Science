This is my recipe, I just wanted to give some tips. When I make this, I mix the cream cheese and ranch packet with a mixer for a couple of minutes. This makes it lighter and not so hard to scoop.

Wicked recipe. I used Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce, which is from this site, FF cream cheese and 2% sharp cheddar. I tried just a little and I had to hurry up and wrap it up for Husband. He's going to love it. Thanks for sharing such a yum recipe! NOTE: I have Stacy's Naked Pita Chips and Fritos Scoops to serve with it, but I did try my one bite with a piece of celery.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this dip. Made it as is. Its perfect. I let the ranch and cream cheese get aquainted for a couple of hours and then i assembled the rest. UPDATE I made this with cheap bbq sauce and ohhhh no. Make sure you use a thick bbq sauce. the thin stuff makes the consistency weird.

I wasn't sure how the bbq sauce and ranch cream cheese would taste together, but I've seen recommended so many times in the Recipe Exchange that I had to give it a try.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce and served it with corn chips.  This is a great dip and I will definitely be making again!  Thanks Gina!!

Delicious! I made the cream cheese/ranch/bacon layer last night, added the rest about 2 hours before serving, to avoid soggy peppers/tomatoes. Used low-fat cream cheese and turkey bacon -  tasted great! First spread it into an 8x8, but that would have made the crm cheese layer too thick...scooped into pie plate as recipe called for. Next time will pull out of fridge about 10 min before serving to soften, as Stacy's Pita Chips (thick!) kept cracking when trying to scoop up the cold ranch part. SO easy and inhaled by guests at the pool (and the lifeguards who enjoyed the little bit of leftovers ; )

this was a very quick and easy dip with great results. I made it the morning I needed it and the flavour came through great. Dips are always better the next day and the family finished it quickly, thanks Gina!

This is one of the best summer time dips I have ever made. I used 8oz sour cream and 8oz of cream cheese to make the dip not so hard. For the BBQ sauce I used Cattleman's Memphis Sweet. My family LOVED it. My husband and father could not stop eating it. They suggested next time I use some chopped japalpeno for some kick. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Seems a lot of people complained about how hard this dip is, well I serve in a pie plate with a cheese knife and crackers. People understood and used the knife so no broken crackers or difficulting scooping.  Used Bull's Eye brand BBQ sauce because it always wins taste test (and no HFCS), used pre-cooked chopped bacon - did not measure just dusted across the top then followed with some roasted chopped chicken breasts.  Partially made the night before, took to a potluck the next day adding the tomato, green peppers and cheese just before serving.  The unmelted cheese was not an issue.  People really liked this as a change of pace from the "taco" version which doesn't have melted cheese either.  I am going to add the green onion next time as been suggested by others.  5 Stars for presentation - really looked nice in a pie dish sitting on a platter surrounded by crackers.

I mixed the BBQ sauce with the cream cheese and ranch to make it more scoopable because I couldn't find my hand mixer.  I like the dip, but I don't love it.  One change I would probably make next time would be to eliminate the bacon because it gets soggy quickly, which I don't like.  I used Bullseye Original BBQ sauce and served it with Fritos scoops.

Other than using 8 oz. of sour cream and one 8 oz brick of cream cheese, based on the suggestions of other reviews, I stayed true to the recipe. Of those that were able to sample it, we agreed Gina's dip was very good. Thank you, Gina!

I tried Gina, I really did, I just didn't care for this much. It's not awful, by any means. The flavors just didn't go together, imo. Sorry:(

Love this recipe!  Every event I make it for, everyone absolutely loves it.  I get told to make it every time I attend something.  I would recommend mixing the cream cheese & ranch mix 24 hours ahead of time & refrigerating it.  It helps make the cream cheese get that ranchy flavor.

It was edible, but it was not my favorite. It was eaten, but I don't think I'd make it again.  The flavor combinations were just weird for me. Parts of it went well and others just seemed out of place to me.

Good stuff! Had to stop myself from eating too much before dinner to save room. I thought bbq sauce would overpower the dip but it didn't! Served with hard flavored crackers and corn chip dippers. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this dip for a BBQ yesterday and it was a BIG HIT!  Everyone said "this is a keeper".  I think it goes best with frito lay scoops.  Full of flavor and so refreshing.  I did not make any changes to this recipe.  Great as is....

I made this for an informal get-together with friends and neighbors.  Even letting it sit out for an hour or so before guests arrived, the cream cheese was WAY too hard for scooping with tortilla scoops or crackers.  Next time, I'm going to use one brick of cream cheese and one cup of sour cream to make it more dippable.  Everyone liked the combination of flavors, so I can't wait to taste it when you can get more dip on your chip.  ***THANKS IrishGina74 for your suggestion below.  I'll try that for sure!!***

I love this dip!  I used a garlic BBQ sauce, and served with tortilla chips.  I will use corn chips next time, because the picture by Christina looks so good on one!  So glad it is published now so everyone can enjoy this delight!

Okay, here's the deal.  I read most of the reviews, as I usually do, and modified the recipe as follows:   First, I added three tablespoons of sour cream to the cream cheese/ranch blend.  Next, I added a bit more barbecue sauce than the recipe called for.  I like barbecue sauce.  I mean, I wouldn't drink it or anything, but I do like it, and a bit extra didn't hurt.  Third, don't be afraid to add the amount of toppings called for.  It might seem like a lot, but trust me, it's not.  So be generous with the bacon and veggies.  One can never have too much cheese of course.  I added some green onions on top for color and a bit more taste.  Again, be generous.

Now... this is important... the dip needs a sturdy chip, so I used Fritos.  They hold up better than tortilla chips, and you'll appreciate that.  Someone suggested putting a knife or spoon out so people could use this as a spread, which would be easier than dipping the Fritos.  Either way works... spread would be easier if you don't add the sour cream.

Make this recipe.  It's easy.  And... bacon.  And cheese.  I mean, seriously?  Why are you still reading this?  Get off your butt and make it!

Amazing! I had two guests literally take this dish from the table to eat it in their laps. It was the first dish to be finished. I put out frito scoops and tortilla chips, and everyone liked the scoops the best. I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce, as another reviewer suggested, from this site. I will be making this again! Thank you!!

This stuff is amazing!!! Seriously!!! I doubled the recipe, added 2 cups of sourc cream, and instead of ranch mix, I used Lipton Onion Soup instead.  It made a 9X13 pan and it was gone within 30 minutes.  I used wavy chips and Frito Scoops.  Everyone has already told me this is the dip I need to bring to gatherings from now on....can't go wrong with it!!

Absolutely fabulous dip! Always the first to go at parties! My boyfriend even requests I double the recipe so there's enough! I do change it a little though- I add sliced green onions and omit the tomato... just a personal preference. Thanks IrishGina!!!!

This is the best dip I've ever tasted.  I usually double this recipe for any potlucks or parties we go to and I never seem to bring any home.  The 1st time I made it as stated, but have since tweaked it to (what I think) pefection.  To the cream cheese, I add enough sour cream to make it a creamy mix (about 8 oz).  This way it's easier to scoop up than just straight cream cheese.  I also only use Uncle Dan's Classic Ranch mix... it's the best by far!  I use Kirkland brand crumbled bacon that's already made and KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce with a lot of diced tomatoes...  I usually serve it in my 8x8 casserole dish with Fritos.  The salty of the Fritos and the sweet of the BBQ sauce makes a killer combo.  If you like bacon and ranch, this is the dip for you... always a crowd pleaser!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Even though I tweaked this recipe I am still giving it five stars !!  Here is what I did:  Added 32 oz sour cream along with the 2 (8 ounce) cream cheese.  Used fiesta ranch dip mix instead of plain ranch. Still put in the bacon, tomato and green/red peppers. Left out the b-b-q sauce and shredded cheese.  Spiced it up with some garlic powder, onion powder, black and white pepper and season all salt and whipped it all up in my kitchenaid mixer and it was fabulous! I was looking for a dip consistency and the addition of the sour cream was just the right thing.  I had tons of requests at work for the recipe.  I served this dip with plain chips and tortilla chips and was a huge hit at work. This will be in my general rotation of dips from now on !!

I made this for a party and not much was eaten.  I think the cold bbq sauce put off a lot of people, as well as myself. I used Jack Daniels honey smokehouse, maybe this was a bad choice?  The cream cheese layer was very thick and hard to scoop too.  I think it would be better cooked, as a hot dip.

I think this was okay.  Next time, i would put this in a bigger dish bc the cream cheese was so deap it was hard to get all the flavors together in a pie plate.  Next time i will put in a square dish and spread it out thinner, and i think i will actually bake in the oven for 20 min or so on 350 to melt the chedder on the top.

I wasn't sure about the combination of cream cheese, bbq sauce and shredded cheese; however, after reading the rave reviews I made this for a New Year's party.  Not only did I love it, it was a total HIT with everyone!   This has been added to my rotation of "must-make" party snacks.  :o)

I read the reviews so thought I would try it. Well, I will not make it again.My 10 year old that loves bacon and bbq sauce couldnt even finish what i had given him to try and my husband was not thrilled either. Just the combination of ranch and bbq definitely did NOT go together.

Really good!!  I added some sour cream to mine and then an additional partial package of the ranch mix.  Left out the bell pepper and onion because of picky eaters but will definitely add the onion next time.  I used Head Country BBQ sauce and ut was just perfect!  Also, I just used one package of real bacon bits instead of the real deal.   I will be making this one again soon!!!

This dip is fantastic!  I had my doubts about the combination of ingredients, but it all works well together.  It was quickly devoured at the party I took it to.  Unfortunately when I went to make it I realized I didn't have the ranch dressing mix.  So I just used one package of cream cheese blended with about 3/4 cup bottled ranch dressing.  Didn't have the problem others had about scoopability since I used that.  I will make the dip as written next time, there will definitely be a next time.

I made this using Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce and it was amazing.  I brought it to a party and everyone loved it.  Before hand I told my sister what I was making to bring to the party and she said it sounded gross, but then she even loved it and couldn't stop eating it!

Brought this to work as I write.  I have gotten 3 compliments on it already.  Rated it 4 cuz as written, I think it should be changed to 1/2 pkt of ranch and 3/4 cup bbq sauce.  I did whip my cream cheese and used green onion instead of pepper.  We'll see how many more compliments I get but definitely a keeper in the dip rotation.

Oh man! The only complaint I have about this is that it sat in my recipe box for too long before I made it! I used whipped cream cheese at room temperature and it worked perfectly. I always use purchased bacon bits in things like this and they also worked great. I actually prefered this all mixed together as opposed to a layered dip but either way it tasted great and I will make it again! Thanks Gina!

OMG this has to be one of the best dips ever!  I was a little scared of the mixture of ingredients, but everything works together perfectly.  I made it last night for some friends and everyone couldn't stop eating it, or talking about it.  There is not a thing to change about this recipe.  Thanks Gina!

Using just cream cheese made the dip a little too solid so I used 1 package cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/4 cup mayo.  Perfect!

Made this for an appie for a dinner for 6 the other night, it disappeared!  I used half fat free cream cheese, half light, and I think it could all be fat free and be fine.  Used less than the whole packet of ranch dressing mix,too and it was enough.  Also added a few scallions and served with Frito scoops, perfect combo.  I only let it sit for an hour or so in the fridge, and it seemed like enough time.  Someone wondered how it would be baked....interesting, might have to try that.  I personally might like to try adding a meat layer, or add chicken in with the BBQ sauce layer..  Possibilies are endless and I appreciate the new recipe--thanks!

Like Linny, I also brought this dip to my 4th of July party, but had poor results.  A few people tried it, but never went back.  I tried it and found the BBQ sauce taste overwhelming.  You read all of the ingredients and it sounds great, but in the end, you can't even taste the tomatoes, peppers, or bacon.  Very disappointing, and I won't make again.

Excellent! Everyone loved it. I preferred it with Ruffles, but most people liked it with Fritos Scoops. The only change I made was to only put tomato on half (picky friends!). Thank you! :)

Excellent dip, made it for a bbq and it was completely gone, used a homemade bbq sauce from AR, and green onions instead of green peppers (family issues).  Thanks Gina!

SUPER yum-O! Simply fantastic!!! My hubs and I brought this to our neighborhood cookout this past weekend and it was DEVOURED!!! :) The hostess INSISTED she keep the tiny bit that WAS left for herself lol! This was so good, I was craving it the next day and seriously contemplated making another batch just for myself. I pretty much followed IRISHGINA's directions to the letter except for subbing mild cheddar for the sharp variety (since I was serving a crowd, I wanted to go with a milder cheese). FYI, If you're looking for a decent, affordable sauce, Kraft brand Bulls-Eye (original) was REALLY good in this. NOTES: A mixer works WONDERS to incorporate the Ranch dressing mix with the cream cheese. Of course, you can do this by hand, but I found it MUCH easier using my KitchenAid. Also, it is prefectly fine to sub fat-free or reduced-fat products here (no one will be the wiser). Frito's scoops were perfect dunkers for this sturdy dip. Thanks for sharing your recipe IRISHGINA74! :-)

I don't know if we were just starving, or if this was really THAT good, but this got devoured within a few minutes of being set out.  I used 1 container of whipped cream cheese and one fat free, spicy ranch mix, chopped red, green and yellow peppers and green onion and Sweet Baby Rays Rasp. Chipotle BBQ sauce.  No problems scooping and tasted just fine cold!

This recipe was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I followed the directions as written.  The only issue that I ran into is that it says that it should be chilled prior to serving and with the cream cheese chilled, it was very hard to scoop out.  You almost need to leave out of the refrigerator for a while to bring the temperature down.

This was amazing! I halved the recipe because I was serving this to a small crowd (and two packages of cream cheese sounded like a lot), but I wish I hadn't because it went really quickly.  The only things I did differently were that I used onion dip instead of ranch and mild cheddar instead of sharp, but that was only because of what I had on hand (I imagine either way would have been great).  I also added green onions, but that was also just because I had them on hand (and I love green onions).  I also didn't have time to chill for one hour, but honestly I think that might have made it too tough on the chips, plus I am really picky about the crispness of my bacon and I fear that might have made it soggy (for that reason I also put the bacon on the very top).  I served with wavy lays and will definitely make this many more times!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! This makes a lot, so be ready to feed a (grateful) crowd! The bottom layer of cream cheese is quite firm, so you'll need a strong chip. I used a corn pita fusion chip and also Frito scoops.

Very good but I changed a few things--I skipped the green pepper and tomato, however put the dip in the oven on 375 until cheese melted--it was very tasty!

Very good recipe.  I served it at our monthly game night and it was a hit.  I did use my mixer to make the cream cheese and ranch mix fluffier.  I also substituted green onions in place of green peppers since I don't like them.

Just realized I didn't review this. I used Sweet Baby Rays and it was amazing how the flavors all meshed together! I've made as written and also by mixing everything together. I personally like it all mixed together, but it is fine as written too. I served with Fritos Scoops. Will make many more times.

My office had a dip-off last week and I made this recipe...guess who won?! :) I did look at other reviews and modified the recipe slightly: for the ranch dip portion, I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup low fat cream cheese, added the ranch mix and a few finely chopped onions and a couple dashes of garlic powder. For the bbq layer, I added baked, shredded chicken. I also added green, yellow and a little bit of red onion to the veggie mix that goes on top of the bbq mix. Great pairing with corn chips/fritos! Have fun!

This was not my favorite dip. I think it might have been the bbq sauce that I used though so I am still giving it 4 stars. The best part was the corn chip scoops that I dipped it with. Might try again with a different bbq sauce. Thanks.

I was really suspicious about this one, but with a couple of edits, this was a HUGE hit.   Edits: I used a little more than 1/2 the amount of ranch called for, based on the reviews of others. I also used 1 pack LF cream cheese and 1 pack Neufchatel cheese and whipped it quick with a handmixer -- great consistency. I had some leftover cubed chicken, which I threw in the pan with the BBQ sauce and heated, adding the bacon bits too. I spread the warm mixture over the cheese base and topped with the remaining ingredients. Served with scoops. Perfect game day dish :)

There is just one word for this dip>> WOW I forgot about the green bell and was planning on making chilie relleno's, I had roasted poblano chilies off and used one of those in this dip. The combination of bbq sauce and ranch dip was so incredibly tasty. The chilie pepper gave it a little extra heat which we all liked. I will of course make this again and again! Thank You Miss Gina! You Rock!:) Patty

This is a good tasting dip, I didn't use two package of cream cheese but opt for 1 pack of cream cheese, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1/4 c. mayo. Blend these all together so that it would be more 'scoopable'. Tasted great with frito's scoops.

This is a good recipe. My company actually preferred it heated up, not alot just warm. I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and I think it might have been a little overpowering for the dip. I would try it again using a milder bbq sauce.

I got mixed reviews when I made this some said it was really good and others said they thought it had too much BBQ sauce on it. I followed the directions to a T. Besides I added Green onion to mine. I will have to try it again I didn't think you could taste the ranch in it at all. I'll have to try this one again and tweak with it a little Good over all tho! Thank you!!!

We did not care for this. I find the BBQ sauce was overpowering to the extent that the chedder cheese seemed more for color. It also seemed to overpower the cream cheese. We used Sweet Baby Ray and not too much of it. We gave it a meh. It's just not for us. But I had fun giving it a shot.

YUM!  This is a great dip recipe!  I used half KC Masterpiece & half Curlys BBQ Sauce.  Outstanding!  It was the first thing to go and not everyone got to try it.  I served it was Fritos Scoops.  Everyone was asking for the recipe!

I have made this many times and it's fabulous. While making it this weekend, i only had fiesta ranch dip, so i used it, and subbed salsa for bbq sauce. A great variation!

This was a big hit. Eaters couldn't stop eating it! Couple of things-- First, I had some black beans to use up and I threw those on there. Second, I would recommend mixing a little sour cream in with the cream cheese because it can get a little hard to scoop with chips. They kept breaking. Third--use low-sodium everything if you can-- It seemed really salty for me.

This was actually very tasty. I used KC Masterpiece and halved cherry tomatoes. I was surprised at how the sweet bbq sauce enhanced everything. I prefer this over blt dip. Very good with pita chips.

Made this for family gathering at Easter, most enjoyed it.  Next time I'll add sour cream, as it was very hard to dip.  But there WILL be a next time.

The combination of ingredients is perfect. This dip is so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I served it with Fritos Scoops. I'm sure I'll be making this often.

These flavors were REALLY good together! I used only about 3/4 of the ranch seasoning (based on other reviews) and a Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Hot BBQ sauce.  People liked it but it didn't seem to wow everyone like I hoped.  I had one person say they didn't know it was BBQ and thought it was a salsa dip until I told them (after they had been eating it for 20 minutes!).  Also I can't help but feel this would be better as a hot dip, the cold shredded cheese on top just didn't do it for me.

I'm giving this a 3 star because I liked it....but no one at my new years eve party liked it! they were all expecting a hot dip with salsa in it, so maybe the surprise of BBQ sauce threw them off. i used sweet baby rays and followed the recipe to a T! I don't know why they didn't like it?  I thought it was different and yummy :-)

Really good. Mods: Added some garlic to the cheese, used 1 neufs something cheese & 1 lowfat phildelphia and whipped in blender to get them a bit smoother.  Also subbed quartered grape tomatos which worked well and topped w/ some dieced green onion.  (used about 80% of the ranch package)

This was awesome! I did make a couple minor changes...used 1 cup of sour cream instead of one of the blocks of cream cheese, and I used green onion instead of the bell pepper. And I didn't let it chill because I had an impatient husband...still was very good. I will definitely be making this again :)

My husband loved this, but I have mixed feelings about it. I did not use the tomato and green pepper. I used Head Country bar-b-q sauce, which is our favorite. I also used bacon pieces. I thought the bbq sauce was quite overpowering, so next time I would cut back on it personally, but my husband thought it was the perfect amount. The next day, I actually warmed this up in the oven, and I liked it a lot better when it was warm. My husband says this would have been a solid 5 stars if we replaced the bacon with brisket. I may make it again, and use brisket in place of bacon. A heartier meat such as brisket may help tone down the bbq sauce. I'm not giving up on this recipe yet, but I will be tweaking it!

Very tasty!  I cut back a bit on the bacon and added green onions.  Served with Fritos Scoops also.  It was hit with most folks, but a few commented on how salty it was.  Might try cutting back on the ranch next time.  We will have this one again!

This dip was wonderful!  I made it today for a cook-out and everyone who tried it really liked it.  It was super easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I would change is to add some green onion.  Not that it needed anything extra, I just love green onion.  I served it with Fritos scoops and they were perfect.

I was in a hurry so I used 2 tubs of whipped cream cheese. They are 12 oz so I added a little extra Bbq sauce and I also topped the bacon with a can of chicken breast. Super easy and good. An entire green pepper seemed too much so I used 3/4. Next time I’m going to add some hot sauce or jalapeño.

I didn't think this seemingly very simple layered dip would be overly popular at your gathering, but was I ever wrong.  Very simple ingredients put together in the right way can be amazing.  The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 cup of ranch dressing to the cream cheese layer.  I found without it the spread was too firm for my chips.

Very delicious! I added a small spoon of mayo to the cheese to make it softer and easier to scoop. I think next time I will mix most of the bbq sauce into the cheese and then just drizzle a bit on top. Used green onion instead of pepper. Will make again for sure but next time I will put the toppings on it just before serving.

Oh so good!! I will be forever making this dip!  Great recipe.  To make it easier for dipping  do use a hand mixer then add just a little milk to get it to your desired consistency.

I really thought this combo of ingredients was a little weird, but with the great reviews I decided to give it a shot at my daughter's 3rd birthday party. It was a hit! I read other reviews and saw people had issues with the thickness, so I used about 1/4 c of sour cream since I had it in the fridge in place of some of the cream cheese and then took it out 1 hour before I planned to serve. We had no issues with dipping.  I also read others let the cream cheese and ranch sit the night before, so I did do that. I didn't end up using an entire pepper after chopping it in my electric chopper, but everything else was as stated in the recipe. I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and Hormel precooked bacon. People were hesitant when I told them the ingredients just Ike I wad, but once they tried it they couldn't stop eating! I served with Tostitos, Fritos, bagel chips, and pita chips. Fritos were definitely the best. It's a keeper;

Took this to two parties so far and everyone raved. I followed the recipe to a T at the first one, and used Stubbs Sweet Heat BBQ sauce. 2nd time I made it, I didn't have any peppers or tomato, so I tossed some Mango Salsa I had on top and everyone loved that too.  Everyone requested the recipe.

I love this recipe!  With just two modifications it has become my "go to" potluck dish.  I recommend using green onions instead of green pepper and using a 'fiesta ranch' packet instead of the regular ranch packet.  This gives it just the tiniest zing that had people coming back for seconds.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Loved this. Made exactly as written except made cream cheese mixture a day ahead. Let it get to room temp before serving. Used "scoops" for it. They were a bit fragile for it.

This was an absolute cinch to make and was a big hit at a potluck I attended.  I offered it with both corn tortilla chips and Ritz crackers.  It was very good and well like on both! Thanks for sharing this recipe, IRISHGINA74!

Very good- it seems to be missing something that I can' put my finger on.  It's not our family's favorite dip, but I would definitely make it again and maybe try using more seasoning...

Really good stuff! I thought I had a bell pepper but I didn't so I ended up using pickled jalapenos in place while it added a nice kick I think I would enjoy some fresh bell peppers in addition (check for ingredients first next time). This is one I will certainly make again.

Yum!  As with most dips, the flavors are better when you make it the night before.

Tried this for a holiday party and I loved the combination of flavors. Next time I would leave out the peppers; I left out the tomatos when I made it. Next time I'm using half the cream cheese and rest sour cream like someone else recommended. This will def be a must have!

This is great.  A nice change from the salsa & cream cheese nacho dip recipes.  I've already made this a few times and it was a hit each time.  Its a keeper.

Overall pretty good...maybe a bit too much cream cheese compared to the rest.  I couldn't fit all of the veggies into a pie plate.
