No substitutions, makes a great appetizer, definitely not a stand alone soup.

Simple and delish! I used shiitake mushrooms instead of portobello for two reasons. I had a can in my pantry and it just seemed to fit better. The recipe calls for cooked chicken but if vegan you can use tofu instead. I used both. I had some in the freezer leftover from another recipe and thought, why not? This turned out really good. Simple flavors but good. If you like some heat like I do, give your bowl a generous squirt of Sriracha. I don't have much experience with miso paste but this recipe makes me want to start experimenting with it more. Thanks for sharing!
