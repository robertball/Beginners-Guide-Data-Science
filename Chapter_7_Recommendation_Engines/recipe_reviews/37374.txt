I made two, one with 4 eggs and the second with 4 egg yolks and 3 egg whites. The second came out much tastier. My first pie was a success.

GREAT pie!! I'm not even big on desserts (and have even less experience in baking them) but this turned out very well. BUT I used only 3 eggs and used 1c dark brown sugar instead of 1c white. My boyfriend (who I once thought was not a "nut" fan) really loved this! Thanks!!

This was VERY disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly as shown, and this pie was completely SOUPY! I'll never use this again.

I found the Pie to have a very 'eggy' texture. Boyfriend liked it though.

I just made the pecan pie recipe out of Southern Living's Homestyle Cooking cookbook which only differs by calling for 1/2 cup marg. instead of 1/3 cup...and I just pulled it out of the oven and it's the most gorgeous pecan pie I've ever seen! It took much longer to bake through than the recipe said, using my mother's oven which may be cool, I don't know. But the crust and pie are flawless. I can't wait to eat it :)

This was a great recipe.  I made it for my husband as his favorite pie is pecan.  It was the first time I've made a pecan pie and it was much easier than I originally thought it was going to be.  I think it's going to become a regular recipe of mine for the holidays.  Thanks!!

The edges of the pie were hard, but it didn't matter it still tasted great anyway.
