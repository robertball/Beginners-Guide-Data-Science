Wow! A party for the tastebuds! I love the combination of sweet, tart and savory. I had some trout in the freezer, but didn't want to serve the same old tartar sauce. This salsa really enhanced the flavor of the trout. Thanks to the Splenda people! Oh I also increased cilantro to 2T.

This was incredible!  I used yellow cherry tomatoes instead of roma, otherwise I followed the recipe.  We used the salsa on fish tacos and it was perfect!  My skeptical husband asked me to make it again.  Thanks for a great salsa that goes well with fish!!

Followed this to the "T" and it was wonderful beyond words! I served it over steamed chicken breasts and we ended up cutting up the chicken, mixing it in with the salsa and eating it with tortilla chips. This will definitely go into my "recipe arsenal"!

This tastes incredibly fresh, even though I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos to save time.  I omitted the sweetener altogether.  In addition to chicken and fish, this is great on hamburgers and wraps and keeps in the fridge well enough to dress up leftovers.

Not at all as impressed w/ this recipe that the other reviewers were.  I now know that I don't like sweet salsas.  The orange just didn't do it for me.  and it was way to sweet.  I ended up draining off the orange juice, added extra salt, 1 can of tomato sauce, and vinegar.  It ended up being somewhat edible, but I won't make this one again.

This was wonderful. I used it on grilled chicken breasts for a healthy weight watcher friendly addition.  The only change I made was to use chili powder for the jalapeno peppers I didn't have.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious on fish and chicken!  I come from the land of fantastic salsa (New Mexico) and this recipe is a wonderful alternative to the usual.

I cut back on the peppers to just one and used vine-ripe regular tomatoes instead of the roma.  Recipe was great.  As I have switched to splenda instead of white sugar I am always happy to see recipes that have been tested with splenda instead of sugar.

I received RAVE reviews for this salsa.  I used sugar instead of Splenda.  Very Good!

I was short a few ingredients, substituted red onion for Vidalia, lemon juice for lime, jalapanos from a jar and only a few slices, sugar for Splenda and omitted cilantro.  This was so great and you can do so much with it.  I used it to top pork chops but would be great with chips, chicken, almost anything!  Very, very good!!
