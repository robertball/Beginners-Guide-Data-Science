I made this with only two changes, 1. I used a can of diced tomatoes and 2. I used the whole 6 oz can of tomato paste (I misread the directions). This came out awesome. I believe if you follow this recipe to a T it will still come out awesome. Great sauce for spaghetti squash!

Just made this now and followed the recipe exactly with 2 minor modifications...

1. I used turkey sausages
2. Added a pinch of brown sugar

Turned out amazing!  I cut open the sausages and used the meat.  Keep in mind, the sausages are already seasoned and salted as well so go easy if you're adding salt at the end.  The pinch of brown sugar is something I always add to my sauce which I find helps reduce the acidity of the tomatoes and paste a little.  It's sitting on the stove on low as I'm writing this and I highly recommend giving it a try!  Excellent recipe!

I, too, misread the amount of tomato paste and used the entire  6oz can, so I just added more broth to make it a little less thick. I also added a tad of butter (borrowed from another recipe) and a pinch of sugar, which my Portuguese grandmother would routinely add to sauces, a dash of dried, crushed red pepper and fresh basil from our garden. It looks and smells delicious!  Still simmering...

Finally, my family enjoys spaghetti! No more Ragu or Presto! I made it like the original, but also added diced tomatoes. This sauce is a hearty one & it received 4 rare rave reviews in our household!

I made it for my 2,5yr old and seems she prefers beef bolognese but it was a nice change. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for my husband as he likes everything spicy.

Loved this recipe! The only difference is that I used fire roasted + diced tomatoes from the can. Turned out great!

It was OK with the additions I made: much more garlic, sriracha sauce,  parmesan cheese and a whole can of tomato paste. Will look for another sauce.

Super easy and delicious.  I skipped the black pepper and used crushed red pepper instead.  Just enough to get the flavor and a little bite. 

I also added fresh spinach.

This was delicious - I doubled the receipe for the leftovers, and added in the full can of tomatoe paste.  I used SAN Marzano tomatoes, and no tomato sauce, and it turned out terrific. This is a definite keeper.  I also served it with Spaghetti squash, and it was a definite hit.

added red hot pepper flakes, chopped red pepper (1/2) and didnâ€™t chop the basil leaves, instead added 3 wholes in the pot.

Huge hit with the family, quick to make and healthy. And best of all, it was great over spaghetti squash as well as pasta. Thanks for sharing!
