This was WAY too thick for us. My husband asked me if there was ice cream in it. When I think of "colada" I think of an icy drink -- not like a milkshake drink. It has potential maybe we can tweak it a bit.

This was very good. I'm into fruity drinks so this hit the spot. Did not freeze the bananas due to lack of time...just added ice to mine. Would use this again in the future. Thanks

Pretty tasty although it was very thick. Maybe I'll blend it with some ice or mix it with 7Up/Ginger ale next time

This recipe is truly delicious. My 2-year-old and 5-year-old loved it also. That in itself is a major achievement!

This recipe was the bomb!! I used Malibu coconut rum instead (and added extra)...me and my friends were fighting over the last drops. If it's too thick add more rum!!!

This drink really made a "bang" at my Fourth-of-July party! It was a smooth blend of bananas coconut and pineapple that really hit the spot. It was a nice refreshing beverage to serve on a hot day with or without the rum.

This was okay but really not for me. I had one banana going bad and thought this would be a good way to use it especially since I had cream of coconut in the cabinet and pineapple juice. I was expecting more of a smoothie texture and it really was more like a milkshake which I'm not fond of. I did freeze the banana and it was difficult to peel. I added some ice to make it more "frozen" but it didn't help. It was exceptionally sweet to me. I won't be making this again.
