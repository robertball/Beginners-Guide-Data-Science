I made this with raspberry gelatin, since it was all I had, then used raspberry pie filling.  It was very tasty, and very easy.  I made oen batch, into 6 dozen mini cheesecakes (mini muffin size).  Will definately use this again.

Easy to make, easy to enjoy.  I made this exactly as the recipe called for, but next time I will add a little more sweetener as my family likes their desserts sweet!  And I might add a little lemon crystal light to give it a little more lemon oomph too.  Overall a great tasting, light sugar-free dessert.
