Definitely user error. I strongly recommend you use milk chocolate chips and NOT semi-sweet.

Wonderful s'mores without the mess!  I lined the bottom of the pan with Hershey bars instead of chocolate chips.

This was so simple to make. I made individual servings in ramekins for my kiddos. They were very impressed with their snack time today. I will definitely make this again!

Couldn't be easier! I made a mini batch in a ramekin with mini marshmallows and milk chocolate chips.  Warm, gooey and totally hit the spot!

Came out great! You have to dig through the marshmallow a little to get to the chocolate but once you do the mixture is perfect!

This is good and easy. I used Nestle milk chocolate chips. My husband said I should use Hersheyâ€™s bars next time.

This was such a great idea!  I also made the recipe with milk chocolate chips.  But.... I will most definitely make individual servings next time.  I made it in an 8 x 8 glass dish.  We didn't finish it all quick enough, and it turned to stone!  LOL

Yummy!  I made this with my grandson after playing in the snow.  It's a sweet change from hot chocolate.  We will be making this again, I hope soon!
