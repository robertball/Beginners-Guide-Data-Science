One of the best holiday recipes I have EVER had the pleasure to come across.  My boyfriend and I put 2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier into the glaze PLUS  the o.j. and sugar (didn't minus anything.) People could not stay away from these!  Thank you for a fine recipe.

I always try to find recipes that I can use some ingredients I already have in my house, so was I glad I found this one to use up some oranges I had.  This was a pretty good recipe, and I think the only fault the recipe has is within myself, because I had a hard time getting the dough to get some elasticity (took me at LEAST 5 minutes of kneading), and then I cut the strips to tie the bowknots a little long, but that was definetly my fault.
