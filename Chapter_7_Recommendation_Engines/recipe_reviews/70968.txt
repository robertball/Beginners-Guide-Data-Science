Made it, tasted it, threw it away. Horrible consistency, nasty flavor.

Very good recipe BUT --- cut the recipe in half until you're sure that you like it. I added bacon bits to add a little flavor. You might need to add something else to engage your taste buds.

My Mom and Gma make this every Christmas morning and call them "Winter Eggs".  They mix about a 1/2 a teaspoon cornstarch w/ water, and then wisk that mixture into the soup/milk mixture to make the consistency better.  They also add a splash of Sherry cooking wine.  They don't add anything but the sliced hard-boiled eggs to the soup mixture... my family could never get enough!
