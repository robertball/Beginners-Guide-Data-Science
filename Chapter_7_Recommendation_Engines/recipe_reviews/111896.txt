We really liked this, was a little spicy but not too bad..if you don't like too much spice then scrape off the seeds from the peppers..

This is the best venison recipe I've tried from this site and I've tried a good number of them. I thought the soy sounded out of place but it blended in nicely with the other flavors. I dropped mine down in an electric fryer instead of a skillet on the stove top but that was my only change. Great recipe!

Delicious. We did not include the chipotle pepper, and simply put 1/2 cup of flour in the bowl with the marinaded meat and stirred it in and that worked just fine.  We also substituted lemon juice since we had no lime.  This recipe has a nice sort of Mexican flavor to it.  With only three people eating there was a bunch leftover, and we're excited to use those in burritos tomorrow. Last note--we three were all first time venison eaters, and we didn't notice any funny taste or smell at all.  The meat was delicious and very accessible tasting.

This recipe is delicious...its a great twist for venison cube steaks. I am always looking for different recipes for venison because its something we always have in the freezer. I've only got a couple recipes for cube steaks so this was a great way to utilize them and give them a kick ! I prefer to use banana peppers or jalapenos in place of chipotles out of personal preference. I also like another reviewer dropped them into a deep fryer instead of using a skillet. This has a permanent place in the rotation at our house !

Was a little on the spicy side but we love it that way!  Used lemon instead of lime bc that's what I had, and there's really no marinade to drain off so you basically just toss the venison in flour.   Thinking the third time around we might try deep frying it for extra crispy coating.  Thank you for sharing- will definetly make again!!!
