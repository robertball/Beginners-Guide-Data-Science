This was terrific! I actually used baby carrots and used orange preserves instead of apricot. I think the orange was perfect for this dish!

I made this tonight as a side veggie dish with the Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers.  I tweaked it though cause didn't have apricot preserves.  I used sugar free orange marmalade (that's what I had), and then did the recipe to exact.  Oh gosh it was fantastic.  My son loved it.  Will make this again.  Try it with the orange preserves....YUM.

I made these for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews, not sweet like the brown sugar glaze! The orange zest gives them just enough zing!

These carrots were a nice change from the usual honey glazed.  I used steam in bag baby carrots and sugar free smucker's apricot preserves.  I didn't have orange zest, so I used orange juice.  I added a little more nutmeg and salt and some dried parsley.  Overall, pretty good.

This has to be the most tasteless dish I have ever eaten.  I added extra apricot preserves, still nothing.  I ended up tossing it.  I can't even give it one star.

I think it could have been more sweet to my taste but I like less sugar for the kids. My kids gobbled it up as is so I recommend it as a way to get kids to eat vegetables.

I did not care for this dish. As is, it was very soupy. It could have been the preserves that I used, but aside from the texture, the flavor was too "citrusy" for my taste. Then again, I am not a huge fan of heavy-citrus in savory cooking. Don't get me wrong, I love notes of citrus in many different styles of cooking, but this was over the top. I think next time I may create a sauce that has a slightly viscous texture to then sautee the precooked carrots in, reduce the amount of citrus and find other spices that would better accent this dish to create something more savory.

Great flavor, really like the apricot with the carrots.  Next time would use less butter, but it was a little too buttery.

I have made this Twice now and both times it turned out fantastic. The second time I used mandarin juice instead of lemon and it was still awesome. My younger sister came over for a meal and although she hates carrots she still asked for seconds.

These were PHENOMINAL!  I have picky eaters, that don't like speckles on their food, so I had to skip the parsley, but this recipe was SO simple and such a nice change from the boring butter, salt & pepper.  We ate these hot though, because I actually didn't notice it said to "serve cold or slightly warm".  I thought hot was delicious!

YUM!!!  With these additions: a healthy scoop of OJ concentrate, and a little less than 1/4 cup brown sugar, orange zest from the whole orange, heavy on the apricot jam.  Next time I'm going to try this glaze on chunks of fresh sweet potato, and bake it all together.  My favorite glazed carrots.

This dish was pretty good and certainly an improvement over the usual boring take on brown sugar glazed carrots.  
That being said, I'm not granting this a full 5 stars as I had a few texture issues in that the preserves and the rest of the glaze mixture separated despite being cooked for a while. 
To anyone looking for especially sweet glazed carrots, this isn't the dish for you, or you might want to add sugar or honey. It is mildly sweet and tangy.

Excellent .  Being there are just two of us.  I made the whole recipe and divided it up into two serving portions and froze them.  When needed I could reheat for the two of us.  These were excellent even after freezing.

I used crinkle cut carrots to cut out some of the work. These were quite sweet but tasty. I didn't put near the amount of nutmeg called for because my hubby doesn't like nutmeg (I love it, though). Also used dried parsley in place of fresh. The carrots were a good addition to the sage chops and gravy with bacon flavored rice we had  for dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. Although I have made it twice, the second time around wasn't as good due to the brand of apricot jam that I used.

Make sure you cook the carrots 'al dente' so that they don't lose their sweet flavor.  I used sugar-free apricot jelly to make the recipe Weight-Watchers friendly.  Even though there are 3 TLB of butter, the points rating shouldn't be more than about 2 per serving tops.  Love it!

These were yummy. I will make again, but will either omit or lessen the orange zest. It turned out very citrusy. A little citrusy would have been good.

These were good. They were sweet, but not overly so. Nice way to dress up plain old carrots. I steamed my carrots instead of boiling them, but otherwise made as written. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe using baby carrots. It was good, but not too memorable. I probably won't make it again. The flavors were nice, but not "strong" enough I guess? I like stuff with a little more spice.

I made this for Easter,I used 1 bag of orange baby carrots and 1 bag of yellow baby carrots and used orange marmalade instead of the apricot preserves omitting the orange zest.  I had so many compliments on these,I'll will make these again for sure.

These were tasty. Not too sweet. I would cut the butter in half next time, it didn't seem to add to the flavor much. Beautiful presentation.

What a great dish! I cut down on the sugar by using natural apricot preserves and it was much better received than I anticipated by my guests.

These were okay. I used baby carrots and I didn't have any parsley, and I also used orange juice in place of the orange zest. I think there was a little too much nutmeg for me. Family liked them, though.

This was ok. It was a little too much nutmeg and I used the orange marmalade instead of apricot, which I won't do next time. My little boy did eat the carrots and he normally doesn't so that was good! :)

I made the recipe with orange marmalade as others did because that is what I had on hand.  I think the recipe would be better with less nutmeg.  The recipe was ok but there was just something about it that I didn't care for a whole lot.  After thinking about it, I believe it was the nutmeg.  Take that away and I think this would be very good.

It was rather bland. I agree with a previous rater, it needed something savory. Next time I might try peach jam and a bit of rosemary

Very good. I misread the recipe and added lemon zest instead of orange zest - which ended up making more sense to me anyway. I also added salt and black pepper - nice. Thanks!

Eh.  We weren't impressed by this recipe.  The first couple of bites were goods, but after that the apricot and orange flavors were way too overpowering.  Nobody *disliked* it but nobody finished their serving either.

This is a very tasty dish!  After draining the carrots, I added all of the ingredients in the pot with the carrots in it. Instead of orange zest, I added orange peel and it turned out great.  To keep the baby carrots warm, I put the pot on low to medium heat.  I will make this dish again.

this was awesome.  i fixed it for thanksgiving yesterday.  i was actually looking just for a nice glazed carrot recipe and found this.  since i had the apricot preservces in the fridge, i decided to go ahead and fix this!!   was sooooo good.  everyone loved it.  sooo much flavor.  i didn't serve them cold or slightly warm.  i  served them more towards the hot side.  they were perfect like that, also. this one is a keeper!!
the orange zest and lemon really made the flavors "pop."  thanks for this great recipe!

These carrots were great - easy to make and yummy to eat. The whole family liked them. I used frozen baby carrots, cut the 3 T. butter to 1 T. of oil, and left out the parsley.

I used peach preserves instead of apricot as that is what I had on hand.  The carrots turned out good, but wasn't as sweet as I expected them to be.  I did use sugar-free preserves so that could have been the reason.  It was an alright side dish though...no big raves at my house, but no yucky faces either.

This is a really unique and tasty recipe. I was worried it would too sweet for my tastes, which is the reason I don't like traditional glazed carrots, but the lemon juice and orange zest really balanced it out perfectly. I used baby carrots, which ended up taking 20 minutes to boil. There actually ends up being more sauce than needed for the carrots, and we didn't want to waste it once the carrots were eaten. We used the leftover sauce for fish and rice, and I can imagine it might go well on chicken too. I made this recipe because I'm trying to eat more vegetables despite not liking them, and this was a definitive win, I will be making it again.

We did not like this recipe at all.  I think it would be better to make the preserves into a glaze instead of a sort of watery dressing that didn't really flavor the carrots.

We had this with our Easter dinner and it's great!  Husband likes it so much he's taking the recipe to work so he can make it for his coworkers (fire dept so they eat meals together)!  We substituted the orange zest with orange juice, other than that, just followed the recipe.

Wonderful to spring on the dinner table!  Even those who snub carrots will enjoy this dish.  And, easy to make.  I par-cooked the carrots the night before so all I had to do on Thanksgiving was to "finish it up".

Made this last night using 1 lb of baby carrots (cut the recipe in half). The only thing I omitted was the orange zest because we were somehow out of oranges. The carrots were very sweet, but also pretty good.

Wonderful alternate recipe to just plain carrots.  Because I didn't make the full amount of carrots I added the glaze a teaspon at a time until the flavor was there.  Everyone loved it.

I made this dish for Easter using orange marmalade rather than apricot and it was way too sweet. Will never make again.

These were quite good. The glaze gave the carrots that little touch of something special without being super-sweet (like other glazed carrot recipes I've had). With that handful of fresh parsley thrown on top, this presents beautifully! No one in our family is a huge cooked carrot fan. Some were having seconds when I served them this way. I'll make again.

These were okay. The boyfriend liked them more than I did. I couldn't find apricot so I used orange marmalade instead - maybe that was the problem. I didn't hate them, but I didn't eat the leftovers either.

What a great way for my daughter to eat her carrots!  Not too sweet, not too spicy.  I left out the orange zest, as I didn't have any on hand.  I made sure to not overcook the carrots ~ a little bit of a crunch to them.  Otherwise, I think the marinate would make them soggy.
Second helpings of this vegetable!

Pretty good stuff. My husband normally hates boiled carrots but he took 3 helpings. I didn't have any orange zest so I just left that out and it was still tasty.

This was a good recipe and great alternative for cooked carrots.  Quite easy and a good flavor for the sauce.  I used sugar free apricot preserves.

I just made this tonight and it was delicious!  I didn't add the parsley but did everything else as the recipe stated.  It has a nice sweet taste that is not overpowering.

Came out just the way I expected.  Followed the recipe exactly and I felt there was too much sauce.  Nice, sweet flavor. Thanks! Will make again...Super easy.
