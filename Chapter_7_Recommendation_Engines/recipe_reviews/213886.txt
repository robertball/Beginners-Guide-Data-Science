Oh my this sandwich is pure grilled veggie heaven! I used Hellman's light mayo for the mayonnaise mixture. In addition to the olive oil, I seasoned the veggies with garlic and the optional salt and pepper. I also grilled a red onion along with the eggplant and tomatoes to take the sandwich over the top. I broiled the bread lightly toasting it before spreading the mayo mixture and piling on the veggies and fresh basil leaves. Simple and delicious!

My wife really enjoyed these. She said the mayo was excellent. The only change I made was to top it with American  cheese and toast it on the grill until the cheese was melted.

This is a great sandwich. I am a restaurant lunch cook and have used this as a lunch special several times. Delicious with mozzarella cheese!

I did not care for this recipe. I don't get these 5 star reviews. I don't know what went wrong.   I really think the veggies need to be cooled and perhaps the sandwich pressed and left to sit for awhile.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  We loved it ... also added garlic powder to mayo mixture and roasted red peppers to the sandwich.  It was to die for.

An excellent, healthy, easy recipe! I have already made this three times and my family loves it. I broil the vegetables in the oven and check on them every 2 or 3 minutes instead of grilling when it's too cold outside.

I made a LOT of changes to this recipe- I tried to make a custom version but I'm not a supporting member, so I will have to just add it here- sorry.The only thing I used from this recipe was the eggplant, olive oil, italtian bread, and fresh basil leaves. I grilled the eggplant and put the slices on the french bread that had oil brushed on them. I grilled red peppers, mushrooms, and onions and placed them on top of the eggplant with the basil leaves on top. Then I put fresh mozzarella cheese on top and cooked it in the oven until the cheese melted. You can either eat them as a sandwhich (but it's thick) or open faced. It was SOOOOO good! I would not have come up with the idea without reading this recipe which is why I am rating it here. My bf loved it, and he swore he didn't like eggplant. Thank you!

This was a great recipe and a definite keeper.  I bought a larger eggplant so I had to prep it first to get the bitter taste out (google "how to prepare eggplant").  I at this on a bagel sandwich thin and forgot to add the basil...  It was still delicious! Simple, healthy & tasty.  Thanks Bobby!

delicious! I made some changes, only because I had to use what I had. I didn't have fresh basil so I added  a generous amount of dried basil to the mayo mixture. Also, I added crumbled feta to the mayo in place of romano and added garlic powder. This recipe was easy and made me want to go back and make myself about 4 more!

This sandwich is DELICIOUS! I made this on a warm baguette and opted not to grill the tomatoes. The flavors in this were excellent and I absolutely LOVED the mayo. I may grill some onions next time too, just to add another dimension of flavor. This is something I could see myself making over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were awesome -- I grilled my bread and used parm instead of romano cheese.  They were excellent!!!
