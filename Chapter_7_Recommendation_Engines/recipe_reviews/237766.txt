Since this had no ice in it, I froze the banana and the strawberries which gave it the smoothie texture we like.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt because it's what I had on hand, and I will do that in the future.  Not a smoothie that I'd make everyday simply because of the high calories and fat, but as a treat, YES.  This also easily makes 2 servings (at least in this house).  Nothing not to like about this, it's delicious!

I added just a little more Nutella. I used regular yogurt instead of Greek because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely be using this recipe on a regular basis. It would probably be good with blueberries or blackberries as well.

This was just Ok for me and I followed the directions exactly.  I thought the yogurt was rather strong tasting in this smoothie and not very pleasing to my taste.  I made it a second time and increased the Nutella to 3 TBS and added 1 TBS of organic honey.  The yogurt taste was still too overpowering for me.  So, on my third effort I used 3 TBS Nutella, 1 TBS organic honey, 1tsp vanilla and decreased the yogurt to 4 oz.  I also used the fresh strawberries, that I had frozen and my bananas were also frozen.  I also tried using Almond milk instead of the lo-fat milk.  BINGO!!  I have a winner!  So, I apologize to the original poster of this recipe for the 3 stars, but I just had to make some changes, to suit my taste.  But thank you for the "starter" recipe!!

It was ok. Definitely filling but not the best smoothie.
