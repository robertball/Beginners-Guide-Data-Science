I thought this was a super yummy salad. The honey brings a nice little sweet flavor to it.  When trying to have a good low calorie meal, this is a great choice!

Fresh Chicken Salad Haiku: "So close to five stars! Just need to blend the dressing. Otherwise, superb!" I scaled this back to 1 serving for my lunch and used torn baby spinach and romaine. My only complaint w/ it was the instructions saying to drizzle the EVOO, balsamic vinegar and honey on before serving, b/c inevitably, my mouth ended up w/ a cloyingly-sweet honey bite, or a too-tart vinegar bite. This would be 5 stars, had I whisked the dressing together before adding it to the salad. But WOW! Such a simple mix of salad ingredients plus the pesto chicken - seriously tasty and something that I look forward to packing into my lunch for work.

We didn't care for this, pesto and honey do not go well together.
