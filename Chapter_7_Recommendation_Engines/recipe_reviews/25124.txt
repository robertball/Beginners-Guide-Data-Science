What a shame that because of one important flaw, at least for me, I feel I must rate this recipe two stars less than I’d really like to.  Some reviewers remarked that the cookie spread too much, that it turned out flat and greasy.  My experience was the same. One review suggests if butter rather than shortening were used, this wouldn’t be an issue.  Actually, the opposite is true.  While butter contributes exceptional flavor, it does have the tendency to make a cookie flatter.  This is because butter has a lower melting point than shortening, as well as water, so it melts quickly and spreads the cookie as it bakes.  In my case, I used half butter, half shortening, and then refrigerated the dough for a good hour to firm that butter up – but it didn’t work this time. So, I did a little investigating and quickly learned that too much fat wasn’t the problem – it was too little flour. If you like the sort of cookies sold at shopping malls, like Mrs. Fields,’ that are flatter, greasier and sort of bendable, then you’d like these.  If not, and you want them drier, chewier and thicker, then add 1-1/2 c. of flour to this recipe!  Yes, that’s significant! The taste of these cookies with the chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate), macadamia nuts and coconut, coupled with the buttery flavor using half butter, half shortening, gives these cookies a flavor that is just out of this world.  With 1-1/2 cups more flour, or ¾ c. for the half recipe I made, this would be the perfect cookie.

My cookies spread too much and were kind of flat - - I didn't add enough flour perhaps -  but it is a delicious cookie. I made some of them with white chocolate chunks instead, and my husband and I agreed that the taste of the macadamias came through better. We thought the chocolate chips overpowered the subtle flavors.

A good cookie, but I would probably omit the coconut next time and add raisins instead.  I'm not a big coconut fan to begin with.  Also- the batter became very greasy since butter flavored shortening was used.  This wouldn't happen if butter was used. I used walnuts instead of macadamia nuts (didn't have any..and I prefer walnuts).  A very good cookie, but I have other recipes I like just as much.

These were good cookies although after following the recipe ... I felt the coconut was pretty sparce and would recommend using maybe 1/2 to 1C. more shredded coconut. Also I used 1C. shortening and 1C. butter. I didn't have an issue of the cookies over-spreading. They came out really nice looking. I would have to agree with a previous review that these have a similar soft texture to a Mrs.Fields cookie. They did almost taste store purchased.

I solved the shortening or butter question.  I use Butter Flavored Crisco and refrigerate the dough for about an hour.  Works great, the cookies stay thick and soft.  Pam

These cookies were great. I did however skip the nuts and I also baked them a little less to keep them chewy. Thanks for sharing.

I hated the recipe they didn't seem to cook well so I had to throw most of them out and the ones that I kept were quite bad.

Nothing like needing one more egg and had to go to the chicken coop for one. Little Poppy layed one in my hand!  Now that's fresh!  Stick to the crisco. While butter is awesome, I have not figured out how to get a fluffy chocolate chip cookie using butter.  If someone knows how please tell me! I whipped the ingredients a lot then I stirred in the flour mixture.

I only had 2 cups of white flour so I made 2 1/2 cups of oat flour to add to it.  To make oat flour, grind up Quaker Oats in the food processor until it is the consistency of white flour.  It made these cookies even better!

I added peanut butter chips to a few and I made some with the macadamia nuts and chopped walnuts as well. You can also try using a little cocoa for chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips!

I made these today and they came out perfect!  I added an extra 5 minutes to the baking time because I truly did use a LARGE spoon.  It was crispy on the sides and chewy in the middle just like it says.  The best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted!  Kudos!!!!  PS:  Not runny at all!!!
