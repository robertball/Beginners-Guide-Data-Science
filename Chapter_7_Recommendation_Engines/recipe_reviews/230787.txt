This is a wonderful dish.  I am a cheese lover, so this dish was perfect for me.  I subtracted a star because the instructions were sometimes vague.

I can never follow a recipe to the letter, I always add something! 1st time around I  almost followed to the letter - changed Creole seasoning (not a fan) to Mexican mix (like a mild taco type seasoning) and used Cream of Chicken instead of mushroom. Turned out good topped with some shredded lettuce and sour cream. 2nd time I used ground beef with my alternates and it was better. 3rd time I went crazy and used the chicken but Cool Ranch Dorritos-the BOMB!!!

I won't be making this again.  My kids and I couldn't eat it, my husband ate a piece and that was all he could manage. The filling is so-so but adding the Doritos made it uneatable. I knew making it was a gamble - either we'd love it or it would be a waste of time and money...it was the latter.

I made this in lieu of the usual King Ranch Casserole the other night and it was a nice change. Everyone really liked it and the Doritos gave it another dimension in flavor. Definitely a keeper!

Just made this dish tonight! Used twice the amount of cheese to make it extra cheesy and also cream of chicken instead of mushroom. Came out great with lots of leftovers.

I made it with Cream of Chicken soup instead of Mushroom Soup, added scallions and salsa I didn’t have tomatoes. Instead of layering I put Doritos on the bottom and mixed the rest and poured on top. The last 5 minutes I added more cheese to the top. My family loved it, easy recipe.

My picky family loved this it was a total hit!  I did make a few changes to suit our taste.  I used a chicken taco seasoning packet instead of creole mix to boil the chicken, reserving some of the seasoning packet to add to the chicken afterward.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and I added cilantro cumin onion and garlic powder to the soup/corn/tomato mixture.  I also used Cool Ranch Doritos instead of Nacho cheese flavor.  I added the reserved seasoning to a few tablespoons of sour cream and mixed it in with the shredded chicken.  Served it with sour cream and chopped green onions.

I followed this recipe but used cream of chicken soup and did not use the corn (due to picky children).   The results were just ok   Adding more Creole spice to the water you boil the chicken in would have been better   Vague instructions so 1 tbsp to how much water?  I covered the chicken with water and when finished cooking, I couldn’t taste any of the seasoning    Also, the casserole was drier than I like   Needed more rotel/cream of chicken to saturate the chicken and chips   It’s a good recipe...with a little tweaking  :)

It was great and my husband loves it! It's even better as left overs the next day! I didn't make any changes to the recipe but thought of added refried beans the next time.

This is a great, easy to put together recipe.  The only change that I made was using Cream of Chicken Soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Simply because I did not have the latter on hand.

Made this using taco meat and the cream of mushroom soup. Topped with lettuce and tomato and sour cream. Was a yummy taco salad! Kids loved it. Found out new taco Tuesday recipe. Or for when you have leftover chicken or taco meat. Will do with chicken and fajita seasoning next time.
