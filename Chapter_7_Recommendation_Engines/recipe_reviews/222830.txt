Very good side dish.  I made it a bit more quick and dirty (and more like a corn salad): steamed the corn in the microwave, dumped the hot corn over the other veggies and butter, let sit for a few minutes to soften the veg and melt the butter, added the spices, and stirred to combine.  Used green onions.  Thanks for the inspiration.

We love this. It has the perfect amount of cajun spice to us. No green bell so I used a red bell, added a little salt & pepper and used 4 freshly steamed ears of corn instead of frozen. In the summer when I can buy fresh corn, I stock up and freeze a bunch so I can have fresh corn in the winter.  Very tasty.

Great side dish, though i added a few more spices to it and a little extra cajun for some flavor!

This recipe is definitely one you can eat if you're trying to watch what you eat or if you just simple want to change it up a bit!! I didn't really change the recipe too much. I think the only thing I did differently was season my veggies with some garlic salt, pinch of pepper(Cajun seasoning is spicy enough) and added about a cup of quinoa, which I thought completed it! I will most likely make again as it was super simple and it's one of those where you can throw veggies in that you're trying to get rid of. Served mines with some chopped up chicken breast that I just pan fried with salt, pepper, kale and about a tbsp of butter.

My company didn't think it had much flavor for the amount of chopping etc that had to be done.
