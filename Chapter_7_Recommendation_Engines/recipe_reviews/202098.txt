Awesome! Fun to make with the little ones, my daughter had a blast making these cookies. She says they are her best cookies ever! And she loves to make them really big with lots of filling. Lol. They taste great too. Nearly all of the cookies we made yesterday are about gone. The only thing we done diffrent is use raspberry pie filling insted of jam since we didn't have any raspberry jam. Turned out great!

So I'm wondering for those of you who had rather flat cookies, did you completely melt the margarine, or just til it was soft? My mom always taught me that the "runnier" your margarine is, the flatter your cookies will be. Just a tip. :)

I tried to cut the recipe by 1/3 since there was so much dough, then said "Eff it!" and proceeded to make the whole lot. I am so glad I did! I omitted the water and added an extra egg, also used 1/2 C lightly packed brown sugar + 1/2 C white sugar and they are plenty sweet and taste great. A new holiday go-to for sure!!!

First time I made it it's okay need to adjust the recipe more to my taste, also used sugar substitute.  Like the coconut texture.

So angry. Three sticks of butter wasted!  They spread out huge!! And while the edges were overdone,the middles were raw!  Didn't change anything except that I refrigerated the dough after rolling to try and prevent spreading. What a waste of ingredients?

Versatile. I halved the recipe since I was low on flour. Used shortening in place of butter, worked fine. Also, I cut back on the sugars, omitted the water but added 1/4 cup maple syrup.
Dropped onto cookie sheet with a teaspoon so I wouldn't have to roll sticky dough. Worked great.

I added a third egg instead of the water. I also used unsalted butter (same amount). Needed a tablespoon and a half of additional flour once mixed. I placed the cookies w the jam on top in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm them up.  I added a photo of them on a cooling rack. They spread out and are larger than I expected. Very tasty. Light with a crispy coconut taste.

Yum, not too sweet. Reading reviews, I omitted the water & used 3 eggs instead. Tiny bit of pie filling on top.(did blueberry & strawberry.) it's only been a few hours & family has eaten more than half of the cookies! ??

Very good cookie.  I found the dough very gooey though and added quite a bit of extra flour and then used 2 teaspoons to drop onto cookie sheet to cook.  The dough is quite sticky and that helped. I made them quite small, about 2/3 teaspoon size and this made them a better size when cooked. I was making something else and had leftover raspberry pie filling so found this recipe to use it up and have now added it to my Xmas baking list. Yummy. Sprinkled a bit of coconut on top for decoration.

these flattened on me terribly. i hoped they would be more like the cookies you buy at the store with the jam centers. This tasted more like a cut out sugar cookie with jam that melted all over it. These were very yummy. I loved the taste but didnt like the way they looked.

Loved the flavor, but they spread out a lot.  I made them with the water.  I will try again without the water and a little more flour to try to keep their shape.
