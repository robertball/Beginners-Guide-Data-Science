I love these potatoes.  It brings potatoes to a whole new level of awesome.  They are creamy and amazing just watch how much of the ranch seasoning you put in because it can get a little strong.

I liked the filling on these, but it is pretty salty. I kind of expected that though, I guess, with the packaged ranch mix. The main problem, is the texture of the potato skin just doesn't get crispy like in the oven. Maybe oiling the skins would help. Doing that and finishing off under the broiler, would have probably been best.

These deserve more than five stars. I did lightly coat the potatoes with olive oil and salt and then baked them at 350 for an hour instead of using the microwave and then I put them back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese for the "twice baked" step. If you are worried about them being salty, just add the ranch mix to taste. I also added some cooked, crumbled bacon along with the cheese before putting them back in the oven to melt the cheese. I will be making these again for sure!

I made these as instructed, cooking the potatoes in the microwave - stuffed them and sprayed the potato skin with cooking spray.  I then re-heated them on the top rack of the grill while I was grilling the meat for dinner. Very tasty and easy for a fast meal.

The flavor of these potatoes was good, but, my potato mixture was very dry.  I ended up adding more milk to get the potatoes to a texture I liked.  I also had to used 2% sliced cheddar instead of shredded, but, other than that I made exactly as the recipe stated.

Followed recipe exactly!  Served it for Christmas dinner with Prime rib.  The adult children loved it... the little grandkids liked it too once we took it out of the skin!!   I will definitely make it again!

Very good, easy, and kid friendly. I did mine in the oven since I already had it on for another dish. We will definitely be having these again!
