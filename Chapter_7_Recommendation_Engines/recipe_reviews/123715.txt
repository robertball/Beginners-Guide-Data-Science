Delicous. I left out the Worcestershire and used an extra clove of garlic. I only marinated them for 3 hours but they were still super tasty.

OMG!  These were AMAZING!  I ate two pork chops they were so good!  I made slight changes as suggested by others to marinade- 2 garlic cloves, and 1 tablespoon honey and i refrigerated it for about 8hrs.  SO GOOD!  Must give this a try!  I think it'll be good on other items as well (Chicken, steak...)

I've been using this marinade for so long I couldn't remember where I got the recipe from. Good thing I did not try to submit it. That being said, this is a very good marinade. The flavours blend well together and the pork chops always come out juicy. I turn the pork chops over a few times while they are marinating. As another reviewer mentioned. Don't overcook the meat.
Thanks for many yummy pork chop dinners!
**Update** Many times I 1/2 this marinade when I use chops that are thinner than 1" or I am preparing less meat. I hate wasting something like this that tastes so good.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I use this recipe whenever I grill pork chops or a pork tenderloin and marinate it anywhere from 2-5 hours.  I add about 1 tablespoon of honey.  It is always awesome!!  (just don't over cook your pork)

My family loves this marinade...it is also terrific on chicken breasts!  The meat was incredibly flavorful and tender...I reserved some of the marinade before combining with the meat and brushed it on during the last few minutes of grilling.  I did not have fresh garlic, so I substituted 1/8 tsp. garlic powder when I made this.  I also substituted extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil and used apple cider vinegar.

This was very good.  One of the few marinades I have used that actually infused the flavor into the pork chops after only a few hours.  Very flavorful.

These were very good.  They actually tasted a little like steak.  In fact, this marinade would probably be good on steak.  I only added a little more garlic than called for, but otherwise kept the marinade as is and used on pork steaks because that's what I had on hand.  I'll do this one again, for sure!

I made these for dinner a couple of nights ago, and served them with Grilled Soy-Sesame Asparagus from this site, and soba noodles. Really, really good, but I think next time I may add a little fresh grated ginger to the marinade for that little extra sumthin' sumthin'. Still very yummy, though!

I made the recipe as stated except I omitted the salt and I added two large cloves of garlic.  I marinated them for approx. 24 hours.  They were very good and tender. Yummmmm!

This was VERY flavorful. Instead of grilling, I pan-seared each side then baked it in the oven at 350 degrees about 20 minutes on each side. My friends complimented me on it. I definitely won't use nearly as much vegetable oil, maybe just 3 tbsp.

Delicious pork chops! Personally, I have never really been a fan of pork chops; I'm more of a chicken gal, but these pork chops ended up tasting like chicken! Yum! I scaled the recipe down to 3 for the marinade, but still used 6 pork chops. Then I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup. I marinated the pork chops for about 7-8 hours. Even with all the little cutbacks, there was plenty of marinade for the pork chops! I also baked mine at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. They came out juicy and so good! I would definitely try using this marinade on chicken!

Good base recipe; very customizable according to your personal tastes!  I've made it twice with chicken breasts - once with the worcestershire, once without...good both ways, but I prefer it without. 

Subbed: 
-Olive oil for vegetable oil
-1/8C each of apple cider vinegar & malt vinegar for regular
-Garlic salt for regular (2x the amount)

Added: 
1 tsp. onion powder & 1 extra tsp. of parsley

Only had time to marinate the meat for about 2 hours, but basted it with leftover marinade while grilling - EXCELLENT flavor!

Only thing I changed for this recipe is I used just 1/2 a cup of vegetable oil (which was more than enough!) and 2 garlic cloves. Marinated 1" thick chops for about 7 hours. Turned out absolutely delicious!

My family loved this recipe. The pork stayed so tender and juicy on the bar-b-que. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup. I also used balsamic vinegar. And I left out the salt and parsley and added 2 tsp. cumin. So Good!!

Great recipe! whether you marinade for 24 hours  or 2 hours, the flavour is amazing.  This his how I will be prepairing my chops from now on!  Didn't change a thing, just followed the recipe as directed.

My entire family LOVED this recipe!!  My chops were not so thick, so I reduced the marinate time.  I also increased the garlic.  My family loves garlic so I used almost an entire head.  I reduced the veg oil to 1/2 cup cause it makes a lot of sauce.  I have made this several times and will continue to do so!!!

Very good!!  Pork chops are not our favorite dinner, they are usually boring and dry.  This marinade kept them moist and the flavour was really nice!!!  Keeper!!

Wow!!  Amazingly delicious!  Whole family loved it, even picky kids.  I used balsamic vinegar, honey Dijon mustard, and an extra garlic clove (I used a garlic press rather than mincing them).  Only marinated for about 5 hours, but that was plenty of time for the flavors to infuse the thick pork chops.  So good!  My new go-to marinade.  Can't wait to make for company.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Didn't have all the ingredients, so had to substitute. Used red wine vinegar instead of white, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and italian seasoning instead of parsley.  Marinated overnight and still very good!

One word - AMAZING!!!  My husband made these tonight and followed the recipe exactly with one exception - only had one hour to marinate them.  These were seriously the best pork chops we've ever made!  Excellent recipe!

I was just trying to find a new taste to pork chops...I only let this marinade for a half an hour before we grilled them and they were FANTASTIC!!! Next time I will marinate overnight, but i don't know how it could get any better! Best pork chop marinade EVER!

Let me first start by saying I used some type of mystery meat in my deep freezer. Thankfully, it turned out to be pork tenderloin. I cut the tenderloin 1 inch thick, marinated, and cooked. Super moist and has a bitter taste. I would definitely make this again but I would have to be in the the right mood and would prefer to have sides with some sweetness. Served with Grilled Broccoli and Roasted Garlic Cauuliflower (on the grill).

Nummy! I only had two small boneless chops, so I scaled the recipe to two but I really didn't need even that much. Also because of the small chops I only marinated for about 6 hours and that was a tad too long, they were a tad too strong, but I still really enjoyed them. Next time if I am using the same type of chop I'll marinate for 4 hours.  That was my call, not a fault of the recipe. I did think the flavor of soy was a little too much in contrast to the other flavors. Use a nice grainy mustard! It was so nice grilling with those whole seeds on the chops. I blotted the chops dry (leaving mustard seeds, parsley and black pepper stuck on) and made char marks with my cast iron grill pan. Finished them in the toaster oven. Delicious. I'm saving this recipe.

Marinated Pork Chops' Haiku: "Mmm my mouth is full. Succulent, splendid pork chops! Definite keeper." I only marinated my pork chops for 6 hours, but wow, when these came off the grill, they were heavenly. I would definitely recommend either using low sodium soy sauce, or reducing the salt though, b/c they were a tad salty, but otherwise, a fantastic marinade that I'm anxious to use again.

I thougth this recipe was great and my hubby said he enjoyed it more than the steaks we had grilled the night before! I made it exactly as the recipe states except with 1/2 cup of oil. Using 3/4 cup leaves a lot of waste to throw out! This smelled great while on the grill & impressed me because we both ate it without any sauce. We are both "sauce" people so that's a huge compliment to the flavor of this dish. It was so quick to throw together I will definitely be making this again soon. Thanks Jean!

Loved this! Didn't have time to marinate overnight and it was still good. Next time will do it longer. Plenty of salt from soy sauce so I will omit added extra next time. Husband doesn't need it.

I am going to reserve complete judgement on this recipe.  January in New England is not grilling weather, therefore I did not grill and I think it makes a big difference.  I followed the marinade recipe pretty closely, only changing from vinegar to apple cider vinegar and only marinated the pork for 4 hours, not overnight.  I baked the pork first and finished on the stove top.  Meh.  I think it was the vinegar that came through too strongly.  I will try this again in the summertime and I will cut way back on the vinegar, probably down to a tablespoon.

The flavour was awesome, and since its cold outside, I broiled them about 6-7 mins per side, on high, and they turned out fantastic!!  My husband and kids loved them, and wanted more!  Definetly going to be keeping this recipe for "My Rotation"  lol!!

My family loved them.  They were soooo juicy even though I only marinated for two hours.  I browned on skillet and then broiled in the oven to finish them off. Delish!!  I wasn't sure how my 5 and 8 yr old would react, but they couldn't have enough!  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy!  My husband and kids loved it.  I only marinated it for about an hour.  Didn't have worcestershire or  lemon juice.  Used garlic salt with parsley seasoning instead of parsley and garlic.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've tried so far.  I did change a few things... I didn't add parsley, it's just not my thing.  Next I only used 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce - no reason, I just did. I used 2 cloves of garlic. I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and I thought it was still a bit too salty. Might cut it more next time. Also, cut the pepper to maybe 1/4 teaspoon. I marinated it all day. I ended up putting the chops in a baking dish along with most of the marinade and baking them. I didn't use thick pork chops, I used the thin cut cuz they cook quicker. They turned out great.

This is a keeper. We marinated the boneless pork chops an extra day because we had an unexpected change of plans the day we were going to cook them. I think the extra day really made them even better. We grilled them outside and they were spectacular.

Followed this exactly and they were awesome!  (Except I didn't add the parsely - I forgot)  I did marinate them overnight as the recipe suggests.  If anyone makes these and they do not taste good, it may be the pork.

I marinated the chops for about 24 hours and they came out just okay. The marinade tasted very generic and I think skipping a marinade and just coating the pork chops with a little oil and a good amount of salt and pepper before cooking would be superior. Typically with meat, simpler is better. This certainly wasn't bad, but I doubt I'd make it again. Thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly excellent flavor!  Used on pork tenderloin and omitted the salt, as there is so much in both the soy and Worchestershire sauces and did not include parsley flakes just by oversight.  Grilled the tenderloin and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used this recipe for a dinner that I did at church Sunday.  We did 200 plus chops.  I marinated them the day before and they was out of this world.  We had so many great comments on the meat you could not believe.  I calculated the recipe to 50 and put that many chops per pan and marinated them in batches of 50.  It is a for sure keeper and the church will expect the same chops in the fall when we cook for them again.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Terri

I thought I would try this as a change from my normal grilled pork chop marinade.  The pork chops were tender and pretty good - but, didn't have as strong as taste as I thought the marinade would give it.   We prefer the Bada Bing pork chops on AR.   I would probably make these again though and just change a little to suite to our taste.

These were so good.  Marinated for about 34 hours and cooked them in the oven on BROIL about 6-7 minutes per side.  Ate one last night after it came out and it was delissshhhhh.  Will keep this one around a long time.  The chops were moist, didn't need a knife to cut them and the flavor was really good.

Yummy! It's a bit chilly outside so I pan fried the pork on med-high heat for about 3-4 minutes per side and they turned out great. Very nice flavor.

I tried this again yesterday by cooking them differently.  I put them in a blazing-hot iron skillet in one TBS of olive oil for 5 minutes, turned them over, and then finished them in the oven at 450 degrees for another 5 minutes.  They were simply fantastic.   This recipe rocks! The grilled pork chops taste like grilled steak. Ignore the ideas from reviewers that made substitutions or changed the quantities. Leave the recipe exactly like it is....don't change a thing!

I thought this was delicious it tasted almost exactly like the Carolina country marinade packet from McCormick except without the caraway seed. My boyfriend didn't like it as much as I did, but I love vinegary/mustardy tastes so I thought it was great. He said he wished I had marinated the broccoli in it, and used the Asian marinade I used for the broccoli on the pork chops. But like I said if you like the Carolina country marinade or Georgia mustard type barbecue sauce then this is right up your alley.

Good flavor, but way too much oil.  Next time I would prepare as written with less oil and more lemon juice.

Best pork chops I have ever had!  I tend to stay away from pork chops because they always turn out dry and lack flavor.  I made his marinade and followed the instructions, almost exactly.  I didn't have parsley so I used oregano and I doubled the garlic (minced from a jar).  I marinated them for about 20 hours and broiled them instead of grilling.  Absolutely delicious!!!!

I thought this was amazing. I did change a couple of t things like I had to broil the pork chop because it was raining outside and I didn't put any parsley flakes in it.

I've never had luck with pork chops, mine are always dry. But I had 2 thick chops from the farm and thought I'd give this recipe a try - it was great! The chops were moist, tender & delicious. Thanks for a winner - I will definitely make this again.

Wow... I really loved this. I did marinate overnight and the result was a tasty and juicy chop. My overly picky daughter had two helpings and asked if we could have this EVERY night for dinner. LOL That alone is enough reason to love this marinade, but the rest of the family enjoyed it just as much! (*Note: If you are lucky enough to be able to find the pork "Ribeye" cuts, I highly recommend them!!!)

WOW WOW WOW! I have always been lukewarm about pork - but this dish and marinade was amazing! I followed the directions to the T and only added some fresh chopped parsley to the marinade. Even without the marinade this pork would be awesome. So tender and SO flavorful! I will be making this often in the future! Overnight marinating is a must! Delish! Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe was really tasty.  Also works great with chicken.  The meat was really moist and tender.  I omitted the salt and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  I also doubled the garlic.  Turned out great!

Made this for my husband and sister who don't like pork- they loved it. I also tend to dry out meat when I cook it, this marinade kept it tender. In a rush? use garlic powder instead of a clove

So delicious and easy. Since I wasn't going to cook and eat it right away, I mixed the marinade and pork chops in a frozen plastic bag and put it in the freezer. When I needed a meal one evening, I thawed it in the fridge before I left for work and it was ready to be grilled for dinner. It went very well with "Grilled Garlic Artichokes" by rosiella.

It was so tasty! I planned fried okra for side dish as my husband loves them, and I was looking for a new taste for pork chops goes with it. I usually make our pork chops with garlic powder, onion powder, S&P, paprika, and soy-sauce. I like our recipe, but wanted a little rich taste. This recipe makes flavorful pork chops, just as i was looking for!
I did not make any change and was perfect for us. Some say that it was too salty.  I did not feel that way, although we cook so less salt...  I will make it again, and I will reduce oil as reviewed.  We enjoyed it a lot.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

My husband is kind of picky, and VERY RARELY gives my food compliments.  Maybe that says something about my cooking? ha!  Anyway, these pork chops were amazing.  Very tasty marinade.  I'll be trying this on everything!  I soaked them for about 9 hours or so only and they turned out perfect.  Definitely a keeper for sure.

Very tasty marinade. I have some picky eaters to deal with and this is not overpowering at all. I did add just a splash of Chili Sauce and Liquid Smoke, but just enough to give it a wee bit of zing. A very good all around marinade.

These turned out wonderful. I didn't do the whole 24 hour marinade like it suggests, though. I let them marinate for 3 hours and they were so flavorful and tender!

These didn't wow me, but they were still good. I marinated the pork chops overnight and they turned out nice and juicy. Note: this makes quite a bit of marinade. You could probably cut it down by 1/3 or so.

As I'm making the marinade I kept waiting to come across the brown or white sugar ingredient...what a pleasant surprise that there is no sugar.  A very rare thing for a pork marinade.  Having said that...this marinade is awesome.  I marinated for 24 hours and the chops were very tender and loaded with flavor. I followed the recipe except for using EVOO instead of the veggie oil.  Thanks Jean - love this marinade!

Fantastic ! I Had my butcher cut a whole loin into 1 1/4" chops and let them marinate for 2 days!They would melt in your mouth!!!!!!!The only thing iI did different was to add acouple of tablespoons of honey.

Very mild in flavor.  Very good.  Not too salty at all - I added salt to mine again once it was on my plate.  I let them marinate for about 3 hrs, but if they marinated all day or overnight they would be extra tender and so yummy.  This is a keeper for a change of pace pork chop marinade!

Grilled the pork chops tonight, after marinating overnight, per the recipe.  WOW! These were awesome.  They got rave reviews from the family and I'll use this marinade and recipe again and again.  The chops were flavorful and tender.

This was the best pork chops ever.  I used the boneless pork chops, marinated overnight, occasionally massaging, and then put them on the grill.  Very, very tender, and did not use a tenderizer.

These were great.  I do a lot of sweeter pork chop recipes, and this was a fabulous change.  The kids gobbled them up.
Served them with wild rice and broccoli. MMMMmmmm...

Juicy, tasty chops.  My husband, who doesn't really like pork chops, said these were good.  I only had about 4 hours to marinade, but they were very flavorful.

Excellent marinade for pork chops.  I used boneless chops and they were fantastic.  I would leave out the salt next time because the soy sauce has enough for my tastes.  I will use this marinade every time I plan to grill my pork chops!

I did not want to rate this with ANY stars (the website made me give it 1, but in my opinion it does not deserve it) . I had purchased a beautiful pork loin and wanted to try something different.  I read a lot of the reviews and thought this would be good to try.  RUINED a pork loin.

Very Good, Did make a few changes. Used 1/2 tsp. mustard seed instead of prepared mustard. Used balsamic vinger instead of regular (also used a little less then recipe calls for) For the 3/4 cup veg oil. I used half EVOO and Half Veg Oil/Canola Oil Blend. Added fresh pepper from the pepper mill on top before letting it marinade overnight. Grilled on low and slow. Pork chops turned out tasty and juicy!

Absolutely the BEST pork chops I've ever grilled. Very moist, and tender. Thanks for submitting this one. All I did was left out the salt,due to the soy sauce.

This was a great marinade.  I added half the salt because it had so much soy sauce and I added a touch of honey.  Will be doing this one again.

I followed the recipe except for the lemon juice (don't like it and don't have any).  I placed the pork in the marinade before work, and we grilled them  that evening.  Absolutely delicious!

Excellent recipe. Made a few minor changes. Used 1/2 c oil and that was plenty. Used 1/4 c reduced sodium soy sauce. Cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and will probably cut it out completely next time. With all that soy sauce, it's salty enough! Also, used dijon mustard. It's a keeper!

Vinegar was overpowering; soy sauce added too much salt. Brown sugar would have made it slightly more palatable, like a teriyaki marinade. Won't make this again.

Yum!  My boyfriend and I just grilled butterfly pork chops for the first time and we used this recipe.  It was delish!!!  A couple of substitutions (purely out of necessity): dry mustard instead of prepared mustard (had none prepared, haha), and I wasn't sure what kind of vinegar the recipe meant, so I used the only kind I had - balsalmic.  The chops turned out fantastic! We're going to try this marinade on steaks next; I'm sure it'll be fantastic.

This was the best!! I broiled the pork chops, flipping every 4 minutes or so, and they came out delicious. Definitely a keeper and I will make these again and again!

I made these for supper last night and followed the recipe. My whole family loved the chops, they were nice and moist and tasty. My 5 year old daughter who is very fussy was full of compliments and my husband said they were really good as appose to okay which he says for everything.

Absolutely LOVE this marinade. The first time I made it as is and my hubby and son (who are not big pork fans) LOVED them. I subbed out low-sodium soy sauce to make it lower in salt and it tastes just as good!

Great marinade, left out salt and Worcestershire sauce, added honey and a dash of liquid smoke. 25 minutes is a little too long to cook chops, more like 15.

Wonderful flavor!  My husband could not stop raving about these.  Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I added a tablespoon of honey and extra clove of garlic.  I think marinating them overnight is a must - I marinated them for about 24 hours.

this recipe is excellent!  I just made it for the first time tonight!  Let me just say--I don't usually like pork chops and only made them tonight because I couldn't think of anything else to make.  I usually find them so dry, but I thought I'd give it a try and I actually chewed it off the bone!  So good!!!

This was great.  I may cut back on the soy sauce next time, but it was truly wonderful.  I marinated mine for about 32 hours.  I'll be making these again.

These are fantastic!!  Like others, I added a little honey and omitted the salt - thought it might have been too much with the soy sauce.  Usually I'm not  a pork chop fan, but I look forward to making these again.

I only marinated these chops for 3 hours since i was using thin chops. I cooked two batches. The first on the stove and the other under the broiler. The first (stove-top) batch was very moist and tender and flavorful. The batch in the oven came out as flavorful but drier (I guess I overcooked it). They were still very tasty either way. Next time I will reduce the soy sauce or get lower sodium. I may also add some cayenne since I like my food kicked up a notch.

These were pretty good.  Mine didn't come out very tender but that's not the recipes fault.  The flavors were very good though.  These are ingredients I always keep in the pantry so I will be using this recipe often.  Thanks!

Juicy with good flavor.  I let the chops marinate for two days, and the ingredients did not overwhelm or toughen the pork.

This recipe was super easy and very delicious!  I followed the ingredients exactly, but used the thinner, boneless chops.  I also marinated them in a FoodSaver container for a few hours, instead of overnight.  While grilling, I used the extra marinade to baste.  My family of six devoured them.  I can't imagine them tasting any better, but I'll try the thicker chops next time, and marinate them overnight.

This was so good. I followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting in half, and it turned out perfectly. Can see why it got so many high reviews. Used some thick Iowa pork chops and served with grilled asparagus. Yum!

While these had an okay taste, they weren't spectacular. Good enough to eat, might think about making them again, but wouldn't lose any sleep if I didn't either.

THIS IS THE BEST, BAR NONE, PORK CHOP MARINADE OUT THERE! We grill these exactly per the recipe at every cook out that we have.  I would wager that over 100 different people have sampled these chops and at least half of them have wanted the recipe.  I always marinade chops for about a day and a half.  Don't change a thing, whether you don't like one of the ingredients or not.  The flavors meld together so well, no one ingredient overpowers another.  This is my most favorite recipe on this whole site.  Seriously.

Delicious!  I usually find grilled pork chops to be dry, but this marinade made them flavorful and they were not dry at all.  I made these on the 4th of July, and I've had several requests for the marinade.

I marinated pork loin chops overnight in the marinate.  The flavor was tasty but it really didn't tenderize the meat as much as I would have liked.  I think a bone in pork chop would have worked better.

First time making pork chops and this recipe was so easy and so tasty! I did what another reviewer did-seared it first then baked 20 mins on each side at 350 degrees. Defintely a keeper!!

I usually don't take the time to write a review, but this recipe is soo good, that I had to! I follow the recipe & only add seasoning salt to the chops before I marinate them. I've grilled as well as pan fried & it is ALWAYS delicious & appeals to EVERYONE!

I made a few changes.  Used extra garlic, half the salt, balsamic vinegar, less oil and added honey.  I marinated for 5 hours and it was great!  Will make again.

We were in a grilling mood for Memorial Day and bought some nice pork chops. I came here to find a new marinade. I had all of the ingredients on hand and whipped it up in moments. We let them set about 5 hours in the fridge, and we thought they were awesome. I would leave out the salt next time, and I like the ideas for ginger or honey. As it is, we made "yum" sounds all through dinner. Delicious! We will make it again and highly recommend the recipe.

On a scale of 1 - 10, these were a 15.  I had thick chops 1 1/4" - 1 1/2" and they were SO tender, they almost melted in our mouths.  Due to unforseen circumstance, I ended up marinading these for about 48 hrs.  This is a fabulous recipe and will make this over and over!

These are crazy-good!  I hate porkchops, my husband loves them.  I was just hoping for a recipe that would soften the blow to my tastbuds.  But these... these are too good!  We grilled them until they had a good crust on both sides.  They were well done, but the center was buttery and flavorful.  We ate them with such enthusiasm, we're lucky someone didn't lose a finger!

EXCELLENT recipe.  We followed it almost to a T except that we used a little bit less salt, pepper and low sodium soy sauce and it turned out great.  My husband is not a big fan of pork but he swore he was eating a nice piece of ribeye.  We'll be making this all summer long, that's for sure.

I followed the recipe except just had regular (not 1" thick) chops and only had 2 hrs to marinate.  They still turned out great. (Even finicky kids liked them.)  Looking forward to trying them with the thick chops and marinating overnight, am sure they will be even better.

This was excellent!  All items I had on hand.  I put it in the marinade around 10 am and I put it on the grill around 6 pm.  They were great!  I am going to use the marinade on chicken today!!!!  Exellent recipe!

So good!  I cut the marinade in half and used only about 1 pound of thin-cut boneless chops.  I made exactly as called for, only using garlic powder for the garlic clove.  We only marinaded for 1 hour before cooking on a grill pan - and they were so good!  They had a great, mild flavor that was a little indistinguishable yet intriguing... I can't wait to try this again (and I will!), only marinading for the full time recommended!  Great recipe!

This recipe was just ok.  Nothing to write home about though.  I guess I was looking for a taste to really jump up and grab me.  This one wasn't it.  Like I said, just "ok".

I was trying to figure out how to fit more pork chops into our meal planning -- my hubby and kids don't prefer to eat them very often.  But my husband and  kids all love when I make this!  It's a keeper, and I always buy extra pork chops, make the marinade, seal it up in a ziploc and freeze for the future.  Yum!

I am not a pork fan, but this marinade is excellent! I use it in combination with the Caramel Apple Pork Chop recipe (which I modified to oven bake instead of pan fry), and it gives the chops a really nice flavor.

This is now one of my favorite marinades. It tastes great on beef as well.

These things are great.  I marinate them overnight before grilling and everyone just loves them.

These were great pork chops and were nice and juicy, even though grilled.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but these were absolutely the best pork chops I've ever tasted.  5 out of 5 in my house loved these!  We'll be eating a lot more chops around here.  This recipe is a keeper!
