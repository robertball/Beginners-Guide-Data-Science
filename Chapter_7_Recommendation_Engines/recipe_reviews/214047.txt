Don't be afraid to try this!  I read some bad reviews, but I really liked the taste of this.  In contrast to one reviewer, I had no problem finding a 24 ounce carton of cottage cheese at the grocery store.  Instead of lasagna noodles, I used a 12 ounce bag of whole wheat wide noodles (like egg noodles). I also lightened other ingredients by using fat free evaporated milk and lean ham.   I cooked it in the slow cooker and it really tasted delicious.  I was surprised, however, by the texture...everythig kind of melted together and looked like some sort of pudding or something.  It was not what I was expecting.  But it really was very tasty!  I would actually give it about 4.5 stars.

I was a little nervous about making this one after reading the reviews, so I decided to just make some small changes! I added caramelized onions that I sauteed with salt & pepper. I also didn't cook on low for 6 hours...I cooked it on high for 3 hours because I needed it done quicker! I used smoked ham and added shredded cheddar ontop. And I also sprinkled it with fresh chopped chives for color! This was pretty good! I just wish it was more creamy instead of brothy! But I would make this again!

Came out too "eggy" and goopy.  Also, prone to scorching:  must NOT be cooked even a little too long.  Not impressed.

It was edible, my husband ate it, but not me.  It was like lasagna but without the flavor ingredients.  No flavor, strange texture.  Also note, 24 ounce carton of cottage cheese is not the standard American size, so adjust accordingly.

I made 1/2 of a batch, in a 1-1/2 qt. slow cooker. I thought it turned out well, except that it overcooked. I probably should have cut the time down,  and should have  started it after my chiropractic appointment, but I wanted to eat earlier in the day, instead of later.. I checked  it just before I left, and a knife went through the lasagna sheets, but I wasn't sure if the eggs in the sauce were done, and I couldn't take the time to temp it, and obviously couldn't turn it off or put it in the fridge. I just let it keep cooking.

. I didn't expect to be as long at the chiropractor's as I was, and it had cooked for most of the time specified by the time I got back. The noodles were mostly OK, except where they were sticking up around the edges, and  the sauce had dried out as well. It had good flavor though, and I liked it.

 Next time, I will cook it for a shorter period of time, and use the thermometer to check that it's properly up to temperature. I also think that you could do the sauce, with or without the eggs, and mix it with hot spaghetti or linguine and add the ham and mix it together. I thought the sauce was very tasty before I added the eggs to it. This is a more delicately flavored dish, and I don't think some of the reviewers appreciated that.

This dish was amazing! I added the shredded cheese and cream of celery soup.  Definitely worth making again!

I read all the reviews so I knew sort of what was coming.  The texture didn't offend and one of my kids really loved it with sour cream on top.  I loved the flavor.  The reason it is only getting three stars is because of how dang salty it was.  It was insane.  Now, I admit I'm not one of those people that usually feels inclined to add salt to my dishes.  But I sort of felt bad about serving to my one kidlet because of how salty it was.  I would make it again but I'd use about 1/4 of the salt it calls for.  It's as if someone forgot that ham is already incredibly salty and the whole meal was baking in said saltiness for 4 hours.  Go ahead and try it - the flavor was great.  Just cut the salt tremendously and you might very well have a win!
