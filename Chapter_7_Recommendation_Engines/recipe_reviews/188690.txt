Ok, I changed from blue to feta cheese (I don't like blue cheese) and did not measure anything, which I love about it. I make this all the time, a fave butternut recepie, watch the oil tho, gets greasy.

This was AMAZING!  The only change I made was that I used crushed corn flakes & Italian seasoning instead of seasoned bread crumbs and did not add salt & pepper.  This is SO good that my husband and kids immediately asked if I would make this again.  Thank you!

Delicious and easy! I used the feta, but will definitely try it with blue cheese as well. I put all ingredients in a gallon zip lock bag and shake it.

I didn't have fresh thyme so I used the dried minced thyme I had in my cupboard, and 6 oz. of mozzerella cheese, because that is what I had on hand.  To be honest, I've never really had blue cheese before.  I skipped putting the last 1/4 cup of Italian crumbs over the top because what was mixed in there seemed like enough.  (I had a smaller squash.)  About three-fourths through baking, I stirred the squash and mashed it down.  It was pretty good.  It tasted just fine.  And it tasted like it had a little bit of stuffing mixed in. I couldn't taste the mozzerella.  Thanks for the recipe.  I always like experimenting with different ways to make vegetables.  Next time I'll buy some blue cheese and give it a try.  And maybe a little extra olive oil for the bottom of the baking dish.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried here. I had a butternut squash that I purchased at the local farmer's market that I needed to use and I wanted something other than soup.  I used goat cheese (it was all I had) instead of feta. The flavors were so delicate and wonderful and it was so easy.

I thought this was great.  I love butternut squash and am always looking for new ways to have it.  I did make one change - I'm a Vegan, so I didn't use the cheese, but still found it to be quite yummy.

Very good - I left out the cheese (I couldn't find vegetarian bleu cheese...and yes, not all cheese is vegetarian! ;) but, otherwise, made it as stated and was happy with it.  I mashed it up and mixed with some basmati rice.  Yum!

This was delicious!  I loved the sweet taste of the squash with the tartness of the blue cheese.  Yum!  Even my three-year-old son ate it (who is very picky).

AMAZING!! The only thing I changed was using gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese, but really it would pretty much taste the same. I think I may have left it in for longer, just keep testing it, making sure the texture is right. Everybody at thanksgiving dinner thought it was the best dish

I have made this using blue cheese, feta and a strong goat cheese and loved everyone of them.  If you have never tried butternut squash, this is definitely the way to go.  Easy to prepare, and delicious to eat!

Made this as written for a dinner with my parents and it was great.  Loved the flavor!  Some of the squash was still pretty crunchy in the center of the dish, but the top was on the verge of burnt. Next time, I will cook longer and cover the dish until the last 5-10 minutes.

this was ok for us.  the blue cheese took over the flavor of the dish.  topped with panko (unseasoned) which didn't help as it was very bland.  thanks for the post THT.  **edit - the leftovers mixed with some cooked pasta w/mixed veggies turned this into a nice leftover main dish sprinkled with some parm & black pepper.**

This is the best butternut squash dish I have ever had, and I love butternut squash.  I substituted feta for blue cheese.  
Made a double batch and was sorely tempted to eat the entire pan.
This was absolutely amazing.  I honestly can't imagine anyone not liking this.  The dish was savory and fragrant and satisfying.  Bonus points for making my house smell heavenly. 
I am going to make one small variation next time and add toasted pine nuts to the dish as I am using this as an entree.

Probably one of the best recipes I've ever made. You wouldn't think butternut squash and blue cheese would work, but the flavors compliment each other perfectly. I made this a few nights ago and went out to buy the ingredients again today!

Loved this recipe. Have made it several times in a variety of ways. Last time I used feta cheese, added brussel sprouts and some browned crumbled italian sausage. Made a wonderful one bowl meal.

Surprisingly good, who would've thunk it? :) I forgot the thyme and I only have dried so I don't know that it would have made a difference. I did add chopped mushrooms because I had a few I needed to use. When I make it again I will make it with the thyme and without the mushrooms.

My husband bragged about this to our family for days.  He couldn't stop eating it and begged me to make more.  I used feta cheese instead and added some ground up Fiber one for added fiber and some panko for added crunch and mixed it with the bread crumbs.  Delicious!

this is always gets finished when i bring it to a potluck and people want more.  there is so much flavor, it is so easy, and so versatile.  most of the time i don't even use the thyme because i don't have it on hand.  it tastes great with leeks too, for a more mild onion flavor component.

I don't like butternut squash all that much. That being said, I really enjoyed this recipe. We followed the recipe exactly, but it needed a tad more cooking time. I am looking forward to making this again.

This is delicious!  All the flavors work together so well, I think the blue cheese is a must, it adds a tangy richness.  I just ate this alone for dinner but it would also be great as a side dish for Thanksgiving or any dinner.  Love it!

The use of blue cheese is so unique and great for a different take on butternut squash vs. the usual additions of brown sugar, honey, etc.  It definitely adds that blue cheese bite so be sure you are a blue cheese fan before attempting. Really yummy!

This was ok.  We're used to sweet butternut squash recipes.  I figured we'd try this to change it up a bit.  It was different and somewhat tasty.

I despise blue cheese, so I'll swap it with mozzarella or asiago cheese. The recipe as prepared is really mild to bland. I ended up using an entire onion, double the thyme, and added Rosemary, garlic, and herbes de Provence.

This was really yummy Used goat cheese because that's what I had on hand. Threw in a handful of dried cranberries. Mixed in all up in the baking dish-no need to dirty another bowl. Will add walnuts next time for some crunch.

Since I thought it was slightly heavy on the onion flavor, next time I would use less onion or saute onion first before mixing with other ingredients.  Otherwise it was a tasty twist for butternut squash.

I have already made this 4 or 5 times and it's always a hit. super easy and really really delicious! i use goat cheese instead of blue cheese and whatever herbs i feel like throwing there [rosemary is my fav] and it's just perfect. great for potlucks, holiday meals or any dinner [though the prep/cook time is a bit long]! =)

I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese after reading reviews that suggest it (since I don't like blue cheese). I also used home made bread crumbs and seasoning and didn't measure but it was more bread crumbs than suggested and I think that it was needed.

I really loved this recipe! It was easy, only a few ingredients -- and the blue cheese really worked well with the butternut squash! Don't skimp on the thyme. I used fresh thyme (as the recipe calls for) but probably put in 2-3 tablespoons and it wasn't overpowering. This will be a go-to winter dish for me!

I tried making this recipe last night for my boyfriend to accompany ham and sides, and honestly this didn't turn out as expected. I love butternut squash when it's cut in half, rubbed with olive oil and salt, baked in the over for nearly an hour, then eaten baked potato style. But this dish was disappointing, and we barely ate any of it. I did bake the squash before removing its pulp, which I thought would be easier than cutting it up (though I'll rethink that in the future if I try again). The thyme seemed unnecessary. I used italian-seasoned panko crumbs and in the future would prefer using homemade bread crumbs/croutons for this dish. I used feta in place of blue cheese (my boyfriend's preference), probably 1/3 cup, and it wasn't enough nor did it add much flavor. In the future I'd likely opt for cheddar cheese, or perhaps goat cheese, instead.

This was a really nice twist on butternut squash! I think that the quality of the ingredients are very important in this recipe, I will try it again but with fresh breadcrumbs. Overall a nice way to switch it up squash.

This is an excellent recipe! The only thing I did different was cutting the onion into wedges instead of mincing it -- I think it gave the dish a better presentation.  I will definitely use this recipe again! Even my boyfriend, who isn't very fond of squash nor blue cheese, liked it a lot!

This was delicious! I would say that it is very rich and as a side dish may be a bit too heavy. I made it for a vegetarian friend and he loved it. The fresh thyme really adds to the flavors. Yummy!

Delicious! I have never cooked butternut squash before and didn't have high hopes because I'm not a fan of butternut squash soup. But this was wonderful (and veggies are NOT my favorite things). I don't like blue cheese so I used feta. This will definitely be a regular side dish at my house this winter.

This was an excellent dish!  I was concerned about everything drying out from not being covered for 40 minutes, but it turned out fine.  I had to improvise a little, but the base of the dish was still an excellent idea.  I used parmesan bread crumbs and added italian type herbs to them.  Didn't have any blue cheese to add, but the squash stood on its own merit.  Thanks for sharing.

Just made this for dinner tonight! OMG, it's sooooo delicious!!!! I baked it for about 45 minutes...and added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs on the top instead of a 1/4 of a cup and added a few more ounces of blue cheese. Soooo delicious!

Hands down, this is the best squash recipe I've ever made.  I used feta instead of blue cheese and panko bread crumbs.  And if you're lucky enough to have leftovers, this is even better the next day.

This was a great recipe. I accidently left out the thyme and I used regular bread crumbs and Italian seasoning. Worked perfectly. I also used Feta because I didn't have any blue cheese. Even with the changes it was yummy and if I had made like the recipe stated it would have been even better.

Wow!  I love butternut squash and blue cheese, and this was a fantastic combination of the two.  I used panko bread crumbs with a bit of italian seasoning mixed in since that's what I had on hand, and butternut squash I grew in my garden.  My husband and I both loved this.  I may add it to my Thanksgiving menu this year, and I'll definitely be making it again!

This was AMAZING!  In my family, I am the only one who does not curl their nose at squash.  I did, however, want to try making it in a less traditional way (aka sweet with brown sugar, butter and such).  I can't believe how much I liked the squash with the bleu cheese.  I am typically not a fan of bleu cheese but I loved it with this meal.  I ate it with the Kalua Pork recipe (also amazing, easy and on this website) but think next time I will make it with steak.  One last thing... my 5 year old ate it and so did my 40 year old husband.  That is a HUGE accomplishment.... they loved it too. (super easy to make this if you use pre cut squash from the super market too).

I was very skeptical of the squash feta combination that was suggested by some reviewers.  I just couldn't imagine those two ingredients together.  However, I didn't have any blue cheese on hand, so I decided to be brave and give this recipe a try.  I am SO glad that I did!  What a wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing!  So happy to have found this little gem!  Will definitely give it a try with blue cheese next time to compare.

Made this for Thanksgiving and LOVED it.  Really liked the thyme flavor with the squash.  Used fetta instead of blue cheese, which I think would over power the squash and thyme.  Great side dish because you can cut, toss, and stick in the oven until done.

This dish was a hit in my house -- even though my older son announced at the beginning of the meal that he doesn't like squash.  Period. After his first bite (he is a good sport), he ate a hearty portion and declared how "surprisingly good" the squash was. It's a "keeper" as written.

Nice hearty vegetarian dish.  Used feta as per other suggestions.  I did not have Italian bread on hand, so used a bland old dry loaf I had lying around and threw in some oregano and sage too for more flavor - really glad I did this, the oregano really made the finished dish perfect.  Gave four stars instead of five simply because the recipe is a bit bland but overall is a good dish... just feels like there's something missing.

This is my go to recipe for butternut squash, I love it so much! Only thing I changed in it is I used panko breadcrumbs, since they are chunkier and crispier. YUM!!

I keep wanting to make soup with butternut squash but just cannot stop making this recipe when I have one.

Wonderful dish.  Followed the directions exactly except used dried thyme.  The flavor was so good and nice change from the sweet squash dishes.  I am going to add this to my Thanksgiving menue

Delicious.  I followed the recipe and added a little brandy, brown sugar and cinnammon. I used two kinds of bread crumbs, with the Panko Italian Style kind on the top. I drizzled some EVO on top, and It really browned well. I only had ground thyme, but next thyme, I'll use fresh. I'm looking forward to bringing this dish to work for potlucks.  Thank you.

This was a great find.  I enjoy a bit more texture and wanted it meat free, so I added a meatless crumble, sauteed with minced onion and bellpepper.    
Grated Parmigiana in addition to the blue cheese.

I'd go much heavier on the Thyme. Also, if you only plan for 35 minutes of cook time, cube the squash small! I had slightly larger cubes (1.5" or so), and I had to cook it for nearly an hour before they were soft to the center. That's after microwaving the whole squash for 5 minutes on high first! I also recommend broiling the dish for the last 5-minutes or so to make it crispier on top.

I absolutely loved this dish  I did make some slight changes.  To "lighten" it up a bit, I used roughly half the olive oil.  I used less blue cheese than called for & used the low-fat version.  I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Even with these changes, it was so good! The slight sweet nature of the squash, with the saltiness of the blue cheese is absolutely delicious! If made exactly as the recipe is written, I believe it would b even better!

My husband and I both loved this and plan to make it for Thanksgiving. I used gluten free bread toasted and added some herbs de provence.  Left the skin on so had to finish it up with a couple of minutes in the microwave to soften.

This was delicious!!  The only change I'd make next time is to be careful about the amount of cheese.  Mine came out too heavy on the cheese and therefore too rich.   Otherwise it was wonderful.

Yum!! I loved this dish!  The fresh thyme and cheese with the squash was wonderful.  To suit our tastes I used feta instead of blue cheese (and I feel that goat cheese would be great as well) and also used a dash of onion powder in place of the onion.  The leftovers reheated well for lunch the following day.

I used Italian seasoning and the shredded hard parmesan cheese. Once baked I added some marinara and fresh soft mozzarella.  It was amazing! First time I ever had butternut squash.  Thanks to this recipe and tweaking it with what I had in my home it was to die for! The squash was fabulous even before I added the sauce and cheese

This was a tasty take on squash - and the salty Roquefort cheese balanced it perfectly.  When folks change one key ingredient (or more), I find it troubling that they knock the recipe...it's great to offer suggestions, but if you didn't follow as written, how can you ding the recipe?

This was fantastic!  I made it almost exactly as written, except I used a red onion instead of white, since that's what I had, and used Italian panko instead of regular Italian bread crumbs. We loved it.  My mother-in-law went back for seconds, which she almost never does, and hubby raved about it, even though he's usually not a huge squash fan.  We loved the contrast of the tangy blue cheese with the mild sweetness of the squash!  I will absolutely be making this again, sooner rather than later (I think the household may revolt if I don't.)  One small tweak I'll make is to slightly reduce the oil -- it seemed just a little more oily than it needed to be.  If I get really motivated, I might toss the panko/bread crumbs that go on top in a tiny bit of butter, too ... that always crisps nicely.  But those are the only things I'd change, and they're trivial.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

The smell of this is wonderful when it comes out of the oven.  I stuck to the recipe and the flavors meshed together very well.  This would be a great dish for Thanksgiving. I only had a 2lb butternut so I halved the recipe and cooked in a 9x9 pan.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried, just adjusted the amount. I was wondering if I was doing the right thing since most of the comments said they used feta for blue cheese but we love blue cheese and I like to stick to the original recipes the first time trying on this site.  Glad we did.  I will say that I could see how feta would taste good also, and may try it that way one time too.  Very, very good, the only reason it got a 4 and not a 5 was because it wasn't a WOW, but it is lovely.

Boring until you add this: cranberries, bacon crumbles, shredded carrots, corn and walnuts on top of the blue cheese and cubed squash, I also used red onion instead-what a hit! I am making it for Thanksgiving now by request. Also, you can add some elbow macoroni to make it go farther...

Very tasty--probably one of my favorite dishes for butternut squash.  I did try cooking this dish in a small casserole type dish which made it very hard to bake the squash in the center so I definitely recommend using a large dish like a 9x13 in pan and then spreading it out.

I have never made butternut squash before so we thought we would use this recipe to try it. Neither of us hated it but we also didn't love it either. The flavor was nice and it kind of reminded us of stuffing. I thought there were too many bread crumbs. I don't know if I will make this again but if I do, I will use less bread crumbs.

This is the best butternut recipe I've tried!  I didn't have blue cheese, bread crumbs or thyme, so I used cheddar, French's onions and oregano.  It was delicious and I will def make it again!!  I also increased the baking time to 45 min. because my husband likes his veggies soft.

Excellent recipe! I substituted panko italian bread crumbs and only used 1/4 cup and sprinkled a bit of italian seasoning on the top. (My mom is a severe diabetic and needs to watch the carbs) It was well received by everyone, including my mom!

This was delicious! I have never made butternut squash before. I added some diced jalepenos and used panko crumbs instead. This is sure to become a regular side dish in our home!!

When I first read the ingredients for this recipe..it didn't sound too good.  I love all the ingredients but just not together.  I followed the recipe to the letter and- lo and behold, I did not like these flavors (the bleu cheese and the butternut squash) together.  So why the 4 stars?  My husband and son gobbled it up and loved it AND it was quite easy to make- especially with the pre-cut squash.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

This is a fantastic concept. I love the savory treatment of butternut. I get sick of it being treated luke a sweet potato. Of course, I have a couple of comments. I added tart diced Apple to the casserole, and cut the cheese back a bit. It was a little much for my taste. I prob used about 2/3 of the cheese. The Apple was a wonderful touch. I did have to cover it with foil because it was losing too much moisture and browning too quickly on the top, while the underside was still crunchy. Delicious! What a great idea! I am going to try mixing it up even mire with different cheeses and maybe some walnuts. Will definitely make again, but I do think its one of those recipes that you have to make a couple times to tweak to your taste because the flavors are pretty bold.

Last week I bought butternut squash for the first time and I had no clue what to use it for. So I came to allrecipes and found this recipe. I am so happy I did. This recipe was awesome. My husband tends not to like pumpkin or sweet potatoes so I was leary about putting in too much butternut squash thinking it may have similar texture, so I only used 2lbs pre-cut cubes and kept the rest of the recipes ingredients the same. Having never had "bns" before, I have to say I absolutely loved it, and am now planning on making this to go along with our Thanksgiving day menu.

I used a dry crumble feta with whole wheat bread crumbs.   First time my boyfriend has EVER loved squash.  It was sooo good.  I'm totally adding this to my regular side dish rotation.

I gave it 5 stars because my husband actually admitted to liking it and took seconds! It is good; I do like the slightly sweet squash flavor with the feta (I had no blue cheese). We will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious.  I added crumbled, cooked hot sausage to it to make it a main dish.  The cheese and breadcrumbs were delicious.  Will definetely make again.

I didn't use blue cheese. My husband is not a fan, but I sure am. Next time I will make a little batch with blue cheese for myself. I used Feta instead. It still turned out wonderful! We will be eating more of this during the fall! Thank you

This was just ok for us.  All the ingredients alone we all love, together, not so much.  Glad I tried it I would have never thought to have put blue cheese with squash and normally I love the savory sweet thing going on in a dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night.  My husband said it was the best thing I've made in our 8 years of togetherness.  I did switch out blue cheese for feta like one of the recommendations said.  My husband said it was the perfect combination of sweet, savory, and tangy.  He wants me to make this for Thanksgiving.

This was delish!  I made some changes but just because I didn't have a few things.  I used Panko bread crumbs with Italian Seasoning.  Use the blue cheese, it added the right amount of savory taste to the sweet taste of the squash.  I will make again!

I'm sorry but this was not good.  My husband who normally eats anything I put in front of him gave up on this after 1 bitel.   It had way too much blue cheese and the cheese just didn't go with the squash.

A nice savory side using butternut squash.  I find that most recipes call for cinnamon and nutmeg, so I really appreciated this different take.  The natural flavor of the squash perfectly compliments the bite of the bleu cheese.

Delicious! Used goat cheese and dried thyme. Definitely think the goat cheese was a wonderful modification! I mashed it down with a spatula after 35 minutes then broiled it for a couple minutes to get the top a little browner. Will definitely make again!!

It was ok. I thought the contrast between the sweet squash and the bleu cheese was kind of odd.  Maybe next time I will try another cheese.

Delicious! I used it as a vegetarian meal and loved it. I also switched to feta, since I had it on hand. For a low carb option, I substituted bread crumbs for garbanzo bean flour and used Italian Seasonings I had on hand from Penzy's. Wished I had cut minced the onion even further, but that's my own tastes.   I had no fresh thyme on hand either but would have been a nice addition.  Just wonderful!

I made a simplified version by omitting the breadcrumbs and subbed sage for thyme. For pretty colors, I used red onions instead of yellow. The spirit of the dish is still intact! Yum!

This is amazing! I added chicken to use it as a main course. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I just added a little oregano and basil to the mix. Family LOVED it.

Love this recipe!!!  I only added 2 tbsp. of oil, no cheese and didn't add the extra bread crumbs on top.  This is special enough for a holiday meal and just as good as part of a weekday meal.  I usually buy butternut squash to make into soup, but will be making this with my squash for now on.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  This almost tastes like a stuffing due to the bread crumbs and the thyme.  We loved it just as it is, and will be making it again.  As some other reviewers said, you could add chicken and turn it into a meal.

I loved it with the blue cheese.  The only addition I made was I diced some pecans and blended those with it.  My family raved about it!

I thought this was an awesome tasting recipe.  I used the Feta cheese instead of Bleu cheese, this was a preference and convenience. Also, I picked up a brand of Garlic Italian bread crumbs that added a wonderful flavor to the squash. Since I had no fresh thyme, I used dried. Be careful of the substitution, it is not one-to-one.

This is good, but I had to youtube about peeling and dicing a squash.  I can't believe no one complained about that.  This is excellent but only if you like bleu cheese.

This is a delicious and an easy recipe, especially if you buy the squash already cubed.  The blue cheese defines the taste, and the baked bread crumbs add a nice consistency.  We make it regularly.

It was pretty good but I think it's better as a side than a main dish. I couldn't find a 4 lb squash so I got two 2 lb squashes and I ended up with waaay too much squash for a single baking dish. I ended up using about 2/3 of it which filled a 9x13 pan and eyeball reduced the other ingredients proportionately. I liked how the the flavors worked together and it smelled so good while it was baking. Oh and I did have to cook it longer than 35 min (about 45ish min), and even when I finally took it out to keep the top from burning, most of the middle was still crispy but tasted OK. I cut the squash into 1/2-3/4 in cubes. Next time I think I will parboil the chunks before combining with the other ingredients and baking.

It was ok. I love blue cheese, but didn't like it combined with the butternut squash. I might try parmesan instead.

This was very good! I made it like the recipe but had gorgonzola cheese and no blue cheese but they are similar.  I did find it to be oily but very tasty. I will certainly make this again.

I made this with squash from my garden because I was tired of butternut squash soup. It was absolutely delicious. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried thyme and it was fine. I thought this would be a great side dish with a turkey dinner.

This was very good and something different from the usual way to prepare butternut squash, which I'm always looking for. In keeping w/ our healthier lifestyle, I used less of the evoo and blue cheese and used whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs (also less than what the recipe called for). This had a nice combo of flavors...it took about an hour to cook for me, but that was fine. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't measure anything!  Used a little less blue cheese, and  substituted Italian seasoning for Tyme (didn't have any).  Had to bake a little longer due to some piece not being soft in 40 min.  Will make many more times!!!

Substituted the blue cheese for tomato basil crumbled feta cheese. I also wanted more color to the dish so I added 1 cup of chopped kale. It was a great hit at the Thanksgiving table.

I was looking for a new, more savory, way to make squash and this is wonderful...marvelous...  I like both squash and blue cheese and while I did not think they would go well together, this is really good. I had to sub the bread crumbs with the only cracker I had, an herb and garlic buttery cracker and I put in more blue cheese, and I do not regret it. I will definitely make this again and start bringing this to events so people think I am marvelous too....Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow! Yummier than I ever expected! Never had butternut squash before so was pleasantly surprised. Wanted to make something other than the usual soup recipes I see. Added 1 TB brown sugar (for my sweet toothed daughter); used feta since that's what I had. The slight sweetness with feta really was a hit! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I had some left over butternut squash and read this recipe.  I added a sweet potato, apple, and sweet onion to the mixture and through it all in a bag and added the olive oil, cinnamon, thyme, salt, pepper and then baked.  Add the blue cheese near the end and found it to be exceptionally tasty!

A winner for Thanksgiving! I substituted frozen cubed butternut squash (which meant I could avoid all the chopping!) and it was still delicious. A nice substitute for heavier potato dishes.

Great recipe. I didn't have blue cheese so I used mozzarella. I think the next time I will either use blue as recommended or pepper jack. The mozzarella didn't have enough bite in it but it was a great recipe and so much better than just baking it which I am used to. Great change of pace.

Very good. I used Macedonian sirenje (similar to feta) instead of blue cheese, crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs, and a basil/oregano spice mix for the thyme. Super tasty and will definitely make again!

OMG! This turned out fantastic! What a great mix of flavors! I can't help tweek recipes to make them healthier (in my opinion). I used much less olive oil, no additional salt and less bread crumbs and added hot pepper, pine nuts and arugula...for me a perfect main dish! I did stir 3/4 through the baking and got more uniformed crunchy brownness.

Family loved this recipe, I used feta and it was great.  I recommend microwaving the squash first to make it easier to cut the squash.

This was AWESOME!  Mouth-watering, and most of it was gone by the time dinner was over.  I substituted feta cheese for the blue cheese and used Garlic bread crumbs instead of Italian.  Spectacular!

This was very delicious! I followed everything step by step the only thing I didn't use was the Blue or Feta cheese, instead I took a bar of Kraft Colby & Monterey Jack cheese, shredded 6 oz. (3/4 cups). I didn't have fresh thyme, so only used 2 tsp. dried thyme flakes. Everything came out very tasty and moist. TY for this recipe it is a keeper :).

I substituted finely chopped almonds instead of the bread crumbs to make this more low-carb and it still turned out great. I also used crumbled feta instead of blue cheese because that's all I had on hand. I served this as a main dish and my family loved it. Will definitely make this a regular.

This dish is delicious!  I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese, shallots instead of onions, 2 cups of butternut squash and 2 cups of russet potatoes and baked the dish for an additional 15 minutes. Also has great flavor with or without the bread crumbs.

One word: fantastic!  I did make it with goat cheese because that's all I had on hand, but I do look forward to trying it with blue cheese.  I think it will be amazing!  The one thing I would change is browning the breadcrumbs with a little butter before I put them on top, but it was still good without doing that.

Loved this dish! So easy to make and really tasty.
I do have to admit we made quite a few changes...I used an entire onion, which was maybe a tad too much but I love onion!

We don't like blue cheese, and so tossed some parmesan on top of the bread crumbs. Loved it! I think I'm the one that ate the majority of the dish but we will make it again for sure! 

Thanks!

I love this recipe and it needs no changes as it. But, based on what you have, you can substitute different kinds of cheese (we've used fresh parm and feta) and spices (sage). My fiance likes it and he normally won't touch squash. I serve this with a side of ham for him. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was delicious and so easy! I think I added too much salt because the seasoned bread crumbs and blue cheese added enough saltiness. Next time I think I will not add any salt. Also, I used rosemary instead of thyme and it worked very well! YUM! Thanks!

This is fantastic!  I know it sounds like a strange combination, but the flavors are incredible.  My kids (4 and 8) love it too!  The only (minor) change we make is that we don't do the bread crumbs on top.

I wasn't sure -- and still am not sure -- if I was supposed to cook or do something with the butternut squash first. It was my first time making it and it was so hard and really difficult to peel. I microwaved it for a few minutes and it was easier, but I still had to bake it for double the time. Maybe I just didn't get a ripe one? How do you know when a butternut squash is ripe? Once it was done, though, it was really delicious. I made it as a side dish and my husband said it could be the whole meal. I used panko breadcrumbs and feta cheese. Delish! Thank you for the recipe.

I made this exactly as written.  It was the hit of my vegetarian Thanksgiving.  This was so delicious.  Peeling and chopping the squash was a bit of a pain, but completely worth it.  I will made this again.

I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, mixed in about 1/4 cup of brown sugar with the squash & onions, and also mixed in some parmesan with the 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs you sprinkle on top ... Definitely would make this again!

The bleu cheese really makes this dish. It provides a wonderful contrast in flavors.

Editing to add that we've made this dish several times and have successfully substituted sweet potatoes for the squash and feta for the bleu cheese.

This was amazing! I had never cooked with butternut squash before, but had enjoyed eating it the couple times I had tried it. The only part that sucks is peeling/cutting the squash up. It's totally worth all the work though :D This is a unique recipe and all my guests REALLY REALLY enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this!  I used what I had on hand, so feta instead of blue cheese and added Italian seasoning to plain bread crumbs.  It still turned out really nicely and I will definitely be making it again.  I think the saltiness of the blue cheese will be nice instead of the milder feta, but you probably can't go wrong either way.

Our house is Gluten-Fee, so I subbed ground up tortilla chips for breadcrumbs, and used Parmesean Cheese, since it is all I had. ( I also skimped a little on the olive oil, since I didn't think 1/4 Cup was necessary) Awesome dish!! The guests were fighting for the leftovers!

Yummy-licious.  I had to substitute panko bread crumbs for italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese for blue cheese...although I'm sure it is good either way.  That is just what I had available.  I found the squash in a 2lb container at Costco already cut up and ready to use!!  Thank you for the recipe.

TOASTER OVEN USERS: I'd probably add the breadcrumb topping a little later in the baking because it got burnt before the 40 minutes were up and the centre squash was still not tender enough, so i would definitely add more baking time.  Would not recommend using the whole pre-cut squash they sell at costco - made too much side dish more than the main meal!  Only used half of a rosenborg blue cheese ?4/6 oz package and the taste was enough flavour.

Wonderful:) I added oregano cause I was out of Thyme. Mashed it like others did and added more blue cheese and breadcrumbs on top and baked for additional 10 min. Everyone raved:) Thanks for this dish.

Overall a good recipe. Way too much thyme for my taste tho. I'm not a big fan of thyme. Will try again in the future with different herbs. Also keep an eye on the crusty top if you use a toaster oven. Don't have to test my smoke alarm this year, lol.

A good recipe that I made some changes too as well, including using parmasean cheese instead of blue cheese (don't like blue), used homemade cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and I also added in 2 cubed boneless/skinless chicken breasts. Thought the dish might actually be a bit 'dry' but it turned out perfectly. Will make again!

I never ate Butternut Squash before but hubby wanted to try it.  This recipe sounded good, and it was.  The only cheese I had in the house was grated parmesan,  so I  used that.  We don't like blue cheese anyway.  I diced the onion rather than minced.  This turned out excellent.  I cut it into bite sized pieces so it only took 30 min.  I'll definitely  make this again.

I have added spicy Italian sausage or chorizo occasionally to delicious effect. My husband loves it. I’ve used goat cheese when out of blue cheese. And, when doing paleo, I swapped almond meal mixed with Italian spices for bread crumbs.

We both really liked this. I used half spicy bread crumbs, half Italian Panko for a little kick. I could barley taste the blue cheese, so will up that next time, because we like blue. My butternut was in chunks ranging between 1/4 to 1/2 in....seemed good for the cooking time, they turned out tender. Will do this again!

Made this for my daughter and I with feta cheese. It was very good! I would use a little less oil, a little more feta and I would broil the top before serving. I used dried thyme and shallots instead of the yellow onion. I loved reading everyone’s little tweaks and changes to this recipe. I feel like it’s a no fail dish that will be good to bring to a dinner where you’re responsible for a veg or side dish. Comfort food- yet... :-)

I made this recipe last night for dinner. We liked it very much. I think next time I'm going to use stuffing squares in place of the bread crumbs. I might just use salted butter in place of olive oil too.

WOW??  I never thought just adding two ingredients would change squash so much! I just had a little bit of blue cheese on hand so added some blue cheese dressing. Outstanding. We ate it all week long.

This recipe was great, and I have two teenage kids that are picky eaters and not big fans of vegetables. I was told to make it again! I would recommend it!

Only reviewing so I will have record of how I made it for when I make it again (and I will be making it again!) Sub Parmesan cheese for the blue cheese and garlic butter for the olive oil. Wonderful!

Don't know know if it was the olive oil (too much?) or the blue cheese but something easy a little off. I might try it again and make sure everything is fresh and mild!

Great and easy. Followed the recipe except used only 2/3 of the blue cheese, And came out great. I bought already cut-up squash from Costco and it worked perfect. Making it again for friends coming over!!

This is DELICIOUS and easy!  I substituted the blue cheese with feta instead.  I covered the dish while it baked in aluminum foil until the last 10 minutes.  In the future, I would add pine nuts and maybe a little bit more bread crumbs on top, but it was such a hit as is!

I made this and it turned out really to be really good!  And I'm NOT a good cook!  I made it with feta cheese and dill, cause that's what I had.  Had to let it cook for about 45 minutes.  If anyone has any suggestions for how to get the breadcrumbs to turn out better and more crunchy, I would appreciate it!  Can't believe that I made something that was actually edible!

I had a review of this years ago when I had an ad free account on Allrecipes, but  it expired and I assume they no longer offer ad free?  Anyway, I have made this numerous times and it is hands down our favorite!  I LOVE blue cheese, and usually add more than it calls for.  Only thing I changed, was I use panko breadcrumbs, they add a nice crunchy texture.

I made this and it was so good. But I used Parmesan cheese instead of bleu cheese cause I don't like bleu cheese and it came out delicious. I'm definitely gonna make this for Thanksgiving.

It was really dry, but I think next time I'll try coating with the crumbs, then topping/lightly blending in the blue cheese. Grated parm was a good addition.

This was very good.  My squash was cut in quite small pieces and the cooking time was a lot shorter and I thought the oven was too hot.  Will bake at no more than 400 and maybe 375 for a lot less time.

This was quite nice, but not something I'd add to my regular rotation. It wasn't a true crowd pleaser- some liked it more than others- so I wouldn't make this for company.

I love blue cheese, I love butternut squash. I wanted to love this recipe, but it seemed tasteless to me. Maybe I did something wrong, I couldn't even taste the blue cheese. I made exactly as written.

We don't like blue cheese but I decided to make this with blue cheese in the hopes this might be a way that we DO like blue cheese.   It smells wonderful while cooking and reminds me of Thanksgiving.   We all liked it but Butternut Squash is my favorite and for some reason it seemed like I couldn't taste it enough in this dish.   Maybe the blue cheese and thyme mask the squash flavor a bit.

This recipe came out dry and a little boring. I baked covered for 20 min and uncovered for last 10 min. 

It perked up when I added extra salt and pepper. It also got a boost after I drizzled it with almond milk. 

Subbed 2 lbs of squash for 1 bushel of kale and 1 can of navy beans, which were included to turn this side dish into an entree.

Next time, I will add something for more moisture before baking, either extra olive oil, almond milk, just mayo (vegan mayo), or regular mayo. Will keep the greens and beans for color, variety, and protein - could use black beans instead of navy beans, too.

Amazing! I followed a suggestion and use feta instead of blue cheese (my wife and I love feta) and used a little more thyme. Might try to throw in a little more spice for a kick. My wife loves this dish. If butternut squash is in, she has me make it for any event because she can't get enough!

This is very good. 
I made only 1/2 of the recipe. My squash was only 2 lbs. 
I did change the recipe just a little bit to use what I had on hand. 
I used garlic salt in place of just salt.
I added feta instead of the blue cheese
Italian bread crumbs instead of plain
I baked a little longer and took some of the finished baked butternut and pureed it. I tossed it with penne. Very good.
The rest will be eaten as a side dish.

Really liked this!  The tang of the blue cheese was great with the sweetness of the squash!  I cooked the squash for a few hours in the slow cooker first, to make peeling and chopping a lot easier.  Will make this again and again!

I substituted Marjoram for Thyme, since I didn't have any Thyme at home. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again. This will be on the Thanksgiving menu.

This Squash dish was amazing.  Using fresh Thyme brought all the flavors together!  In one bite, I could taste every individual ingredient, the sweet and the savory.  This will be a regular dish for this Italian family!!

The flavors overpowered the squash for me.  I would stick with simply roasting with some thyme next time.

Made this with some personal modifications (like all good cooks do). Was a big hit with the family. Most everyone wants my version of the recipe. Omitted the Blue Cheese and added brown sugar, garlic, cinnamon. Thank you for contributing this recipe!

This was amazing! Everyone asked for seconds. We ate this as our main dish with rice and salad. The blue cheese and the bread crumbs makes this special. It will become a staple meal in our house.

Excellent with changes. Reduced oil to 2 Tablespoons, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, skipped the cheese and extra crumbs on top.  YUMMMMYY Also a recipe on here called 'simple roasted butternut squash' is great. This is my new favorite though, can't wait to make again.  Thank you so much for submitting this :)

I added a vegan Italian sausage made by Field Roast. It's absolutely delicious with the sausage,  kinda bland without it.

I also used Feta because that's what I had and I did not measure but this sure was a great and easy dish. I dropped one star because I felt that the recipe called for too large a quantity of breadcrumbs.  I used about a quarter cup total.  Would I make it again? In a heartbeat!

This one is hard to review as I didn't use the full recipe. I don't eat cheese so I omitted it and it's not worth making again.

This dish hit the spot!  It was so savory!  I felt like I was eating calorie packed comfort food, but really, it isn't all that bad for you at all!  I omitted the onion due to preference, and missed the part about adding the additional bread crumbs.  I would make it exactly as I did again!  I think the blue cheese makes the flavor!

I didn't have any thyme but this was still good. I used reduced fat feta instead of blue cheese but have made it with blue cheese too.

I got many compliments on this dish at a potluck dinner I hosted. The flavors complimented each other so well. I changed the blue cheese to feta). The most difficult part for me was cutting up the squash. After that it was as easy as homemade food could be!

This was so good!!! I used gorgonzola and dried thyme not fresh and skipped the onion.  Loved the combo of the cheese and breadcrumbs with the butternut squash!!

Awesome recipe! My picky kid ate three helpings. Delicious! Might even be Thanksgiving-worthy, though it's easy enough to make anytime.

I made this for the first time today, I only had a small amount of butternut left over from a previous recipe so added some chopped courgette, chopped par boiled carrot and sliced mushrooms I also used feta cheese. It turned out delicious and was so quick and easy to make, will definitely cook this again. cal

Perfect! Used dried basil instead of thyme, and used only about 3 oz of blue cheese. My boyfriend was less than enthused when I said I was making butternut squash for dinner- I was pleasantly surprised when he went back for seconds!

This recipe is awesome!  I followed it exactly except I used dried thyme instead of fresh and used half an onion.   I made it last night and my husband asked for it again tonight.  I made sure that i cubed the squash into pretty small pieces (1 inch cubes) and mashed the casserole right before it was done.  I also drizzled a little extra olive oil on the casserole after I mashed it up to give it a little extra moisture.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this today for dinner. It was very good. I made it with Feta because my husband does not like Blue Cheese. Very good and I will definately make again. Needs lots of salt to help the squash, but that does not take away from the great flavor.
