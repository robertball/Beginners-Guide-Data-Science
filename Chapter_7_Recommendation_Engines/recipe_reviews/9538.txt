Super easy and VERY tasty!!  I love peanut butter in just about anything, though!!  A little hint for melting chocolate, especially semi-sweet as it has less fat content.  When melting the chips, (I use the microwave)throw in a little shortening (I used about a tablespoon for this recipe which I converted to 42 servings).  This increases the fat which helps the chocolate melt smoother, stir easily, and gives it a nice gloss.  Some people use a little butter, but since the water content in butter or margarine can be high, it may make your chocolate seize!  Hope this tip helps!!

This recipe is super easy and super good.  It simply melts in your mouth.  One suggestion I have though is to cut into pieces while still slightly warm and then chill.  Cutting it after it has cooled caused the tops to crack and the appearance was not as nice.

I got thie recipe years ago from a friend and everyone LOVES it.  The only thing I will add that makes it even easier is that after it has chilled and it hard, I dump it out of the pan and break it into bite size pieces.  No cutting needed and the "bark" look is great with the marbled top.  Plus, I get to eat the crumbs after I've broken it all!  :)

Peanut butter and chocolate is a never miss combo.  However, I haven't used a double-boiler to melt chocolate in years.  I highly recommend using a microwave to melt chocolate.  If you're using chocolate chips in this recipe -theres approximately 2 and 2/3 cups of chips per pound of chocolate.  I microwave darker chocolates (milk, semi-sweet, german) at one minute intervals on full power- stirring in between.  I've found that white chocolate melts faster, so use 30 second intervals for that.  On this recipe, I microwaved the white chocolate for two 30-second intervals, stirring in between, then added the peanut butter for 30 more seconds. Also, I used a smaller pan than what this recipe calls for, I like my TB a little thicker.

HELPFUL TIPS THAT HELPED ME: Don't stress over the 1lb.  You can either use 2 2/3C or just the 1 bag of chocolate you have (which has 2C).  Either way, this works out just fine.  Also, crunchy or creamy pb is fine!! If you're not a nut person, know the creamy pb tastes just as heavenly [if not better] than the crunchy!!  I line my pan with foil since I find that easier.  I have my ingredients out and each chocolate in a separate bowl to microwave ahead of time to save time!  Melt the white chocolate for 1 min, then add pb ...then continue to melt for 10 sec. intervals until completely melted.  Be sure that you've stirred for a good 15 sec. or so each time you take out of microwave.  Then I melt the semi-chocolate for a minute, stir for 15-20 sec, and continue microwaving until completely melted.  I don't bother swirling.  I thought it looked prettier w/o doing it, so again.. whatever is fine! :) I actually cut while it's just set but still kinda warm so it's easier or take out my chilled fudge until it's closer to room temp or you will crack the fudge while cutting instead of smooth cuts. Always have a slicing motion over and over ....not a sawing one.

I am giving this 4 starts only because the chocolate overpowers the peanut butter mixture as the recipe is written.  I first made it as written and the second time around made it as follows, which I would rate as a 5 star recipe: I made the peanut butter mixture as written, but poured it into an 8X8 pan for a thicker "fudge," then topped it with about 1/2 the amount of chocolate called for.  I cut these and mailed them to my family as part of their Christmas package.  Everyone raved about it!

Simply delicious!!Very easy....and foolproof....This candy was a favorite! I use crock pots to melt the ingredients...Crock pots are easy to clean and as the ingredients melt, I am free to do something else. Of course, whenever I check on the progress, I do stir the melting chocolates.  Also, the candy sets up quickly because of the refrigeration....I highly recommend this recipe.

I have always loved Tiger Butter. I was so excited to find this recipe! This stuff is sooooo good. I made batches and batches of it and everyone raved about it. They liked it better than my fudge and I make superior fudge. I didn't have the 10x15 pan so I used a 13x9 and 11x7 pan and it came out great. Fantastic recipe!!!!

Delicious! This was so easy to make! I melted the white chocolate / pb combination in the microwave on a lower power and stirred occasionally. I also melted the chocolate the same way (I added a bit of shortening to the mixture, I always find that this helps the melting / stirring process nicely!) This recipe is simple and delicious! Perfect for gift giving!

This is a wonderful "fudge" and couldn't be easier to make!  I used the microwave to melt the chocolates - make sure to use MEDIUM power so as not to burn them, though.  This will be going on my list of Christmas favorites!

I made this to go into the "goodie bags" I gave to my co-workers this year for Christmas.  I followed the recipe as directed.  I melted the semisweet chocolate in the microwave according to the package instructions.  And since I had used the last of my parchment paper for baking cookies, I used wax paper to line my pan and had no problems.

This was my first time making this and I was hoping for more. I followed the recipe exactly, used the suggestion to cut before cool and they look beautiful. But, honestly, it tastes like you took a piece of white chocolate, a handful of semi-sweet chips & a teaspoon of peanut butter and ate it off a spoon! I guess that's what it's supposed to taste like, but is wasn't anything spectacular!

I made this recipe for a bake sale and it sold out! There are two types of people in the dessert world- people who like fudge and people who hate it. Luckily, this recipe satisfies both in that people that don't like fudge like it because it most resembles a chocoloate bar and people who like fudge like it because it resembles fudge's richness. When I made it I doubled the batch and made the recipe in a 13x9 inch pan which was the perfect thickness for smaller cut pieces. As well, one other thing to remember is when you have taken it out of the fridge to cut it, make sure you let it sit out for about an hour or so firs so that it is easier to cut. I learned the hard way by cutting it right when it came out of the fridge and the pieces were so hard to cut and come out not so clean looking. All in all though, great recipe. I plan to make it again!

I have made this a few times now. I prefer to use milk chocolate in place of the semi-sweet and creamy peanut butter in place of the crunchy. This is just my personal preference! Delicious candy indeed!!!!

This was tasty and easy. I didn't read the tips before I made it, but I'll try some next time. I did during my process of making the candy start melting the chocolate over the stove, but quickly switched to the microwave. I also mixed the peanut butter with the semisweet chocolate instead of the white chocolate, because I found the semisweet chocolate to be a bit overpowering. In the end, I was pretty pleased with the result and will make this again. It's just too easy to make to not give it another go.

The fudge tastes good, but it does not deserve the 5 stars given in previous reviews. I had high hopes for this fudge after seeing the great reviews and am very disappointed after making it. As a huge fan of peanut butter, even I thought the peanut butter taste was too much. Another down side it that it does not hold up well unless you stick it in the fridge. The peanut butter and white chocolate mixture on the bottom becomes melted and gooey within 30 minutes of having it out of the fridge and sticks to your plate, which is sloppy. I would not want to serve this to guests at a party. While it is not absolutely terrible, it is something I'd make more for kids or myself to have at home.

I used crunchy peanut butter and added some to the dark chocolate mixture as well. My daughter had a lot of fun swirling it to make the 'tiger'. I let it set up slightly in the fridge before cutting it - I used a pasta measuring tool that I never use for pasta - it has a curved edge on one side that was perfect to use as a blade. I imagine you could cut it with a pizza cutter as well. We got awesome comments on this candy - it's rich and creamy. We will definitely make this every Christmas. Thanks!

This was the easiest, tastiest fudge I've made.  The only hard part was finding enough white chocolate.  My only advice is that I let mine chill too long and some of it broke and cracked when I cut it.  It was much easier to cut when it wasn't rock hard and cold straight from the fridge.  Very good recipe.

I thought this stuff was awesome, but the second batch I made I used creamy peanut butter, and then crushed up just a very few pretzels and tossed them in with the pb and white chocolate mixture before pouring it into the pan. It tastes great either way, but I like a little crunch with my desserts, and the crunchy peanut butter was too much crunch for me.

After having leftover melted white chocolate from making the candy corn bark, I decided to use it up making this recipe.  I didn't have a full pound, and I used creamy peanut butter.  It still turned out wonderful - a little on the thin side because of my lack of the correct amounts of ingredients, but the taste is just right.

I am not a fan of sweets- but wanted to try out this recipe and see if it resembled the Tiger Butter-fudge that you get at chocolate shops.  It really does!! I brought the batch to work to share with co-workers and it disappeared within an hour.  Will definitely make this again.

Whoa! This is seriously good and addictive!  I only had 12 ounces of white chocolate so I subsituted 2 squares of vanilla confectioner's bark/coating and used 2 cups of creamy peanut butter.  I actually microwaved the peanut butter/white chocolated on 70% power and did the same for the dark chocolate.  Easy and quick!  I normally make peanut butter balls for Christmas, but I think this recipe is better and much easier and certainly less labor intensive.  THANKS!  This is one of my new favorite recipes!

I love Tiger Butter, I used to purchase this at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. I do not use chunky peanut butter because the tiger butter I always bought was always smooth in taste and texture. The taste if this can vary depending on the quality of chocolate you use. I tempered my chocolate so I would not have to refrigerate.

This was fabulous! I did use creamy peanut butter instead, but that's just my preference. Absolutely everyone loved it. I've received about a dozen requests for the recipe but I might not share this one! It is also incredibly easy, which is a big plus at this time of the year. Thank you so much!!

These were very sweet, I felt like I was making a mess and doing it wrong when I poured the semi-sweet chocolate on top and I thought it had all meshed. Well they turned out great to my surprise and I will make these again!

Yum! My family loved this.  Our daughter used to get this all of the time at a candy shop when we lived in Ga.  I must say this was just as good!  Melts in your mouth.  I melted everything in the microwave on 30 second intervals, stirring in between. I used about a Tablespoon of shortening in the semi sweet chips to help with the melting.   This was so quick and easy.  I've already passed on the recipe!

This recipe is supereasy.  I used a 10x10 pan because I didn't want the pieces to be too thin.  Next time I think I will use more semisweet chocolate, as I think the saltiness in the peanut butter was too strong for my liking.

This is very delicious, but I would recommend not refrigerating it at all, and keeping it tightly sealed. I failed to do either if those things and it dried out and lost creaminess and richness very quickly.

This tastes good, but it's not tiger butter. My wife and I both agree that there is no peanut butter in tiger butter, at least not in what we get from Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. I used creamy peanut butter and used some butter, and it got it to the consistency of normal Tiger Butter, but still too peanut tasting.

This is a great tasting, super easy recipe! I made the slight adaptation of only adding 1 cup PB to the white chocolate and the 1/3 cup to the dark chocolate because I was concerned about being able to marble it well enough. Personally, I think that this solves the cutting issue as it makes the dark chocolate part a little softer. And taste-wise it is great! I also used creamy PB for the white chocolate part and extra crunchy for the dark part (because I didn't have enough crunchy for all) and that worked great too, although I would love to try this with all crunchy PB.

This was DELICIOUS and sooo easy, as long as you have a double broiler. I had trouble cutting it pretty so it's all broken into bite-sized chunks - intentional chaos! Tastes awesome, especially if you like peanut butter and chocolate together. N

I think this is a five star recipe when you up the peanut butter amount to between 1 3/4 and 2 cups. I use creamy peanut butter and prefer that in this recipe to the chunky. I make this candy every year to give as gifts to co-workers, friends and family and everyone raves about how good it is. It is super simple to make and  so incredibly delicious!! Just up that peanut butter amount and you will have a real winner on your hands! :) And don't fuss with a double boiler (unless you want to). Coarsely chop your white chocolate (I use white almond bark) and place in a microwave safe bowl. Heat in 30 second intervals, stirring in between just until melted. Then stir in the peanut butter (no need to microwave now, the heat from the almond bark will warm the peanut butter and blend it beautifully). Pour into your prepared pan then heat your chocolate chips the same way, then proceed with swirling and chilling.

A very easy and quick treat.  Absolutely one of the best.  Even the pickiest of my kid's friends enjoy it!!  Instead of cooking in a pot though, I like to melt my ingredients in the microwave.  It's a lot easier and makes for a very simple clean-up.

This was pretty good fudge and really easy to make. At another reviewer's suggestion, I microwaved white chocolate for two 30-second intervals, stirring in between, and then added the peanut butter for 30 more seconds. Then I microwaved the semi-sweet chocolate in two 45 second intervals. I would have used a smaller pan than this to make it thicker. I also cut the fudge when it got harder but before chilling it so it wasn't too hard.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I added a teaspoon of shortening with the semisweet chocolate.  I cannot emphasize enough how EASY this recipe is, and how great it turns out! Used a small "bread loaf" pan for a deep fudge.  Cut it after an hour in the fridge with a large knife.

whoa...yum.  Easy to make and very delicious.  I think much better tasting than fudge, but I am not really a fudge person.  I put mine into a 9x13 inch pan, but I think next time I might use a slightly smaller pan to make it a bit thicker.  I  chilled mine and then just flipped it right out of the pan onto a cutting board.  I used a hot knife to help get clean cuts.  For those who thought it was overly sweet, I would recommend using good quality bittersweet chocolate.  Ghiradelli is easy to find in your grocery store.

Super easy and pretty quick! I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate that was leftover from a batch of billionaires, but that was fine. I couldn't quite get the swirls looking as artistic as the photos uploaded, but I will do better next time!

Divine! Melts in your mouth! I used 3c. each of white and semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 1/2c. chunky peanut butter.

I thought this recipe was great!  To add a little "salty" to it, I crushed up pretzels and put them in between the peanut butter and chocolate.  I also stuck them in the freezer so they were firm when serving.  Very Yummy!

This is fantastic! Very easy, very quick and very rich. It's a very forgiving recipe too. I have made this quite a few times and I don't even bother to measure anymore, I just guestimate. Great recipe for peanut butter and chocolate lovers like me.

My roommate and I just made this in our tiny college apartment for a football tailgate this weekend...it is so delicious that we're worried it won't make it to the tailgate as we have been snacking on it all night! I cannot begin to say how easy it was and how quick we we made it with a double broiler (so the chocolate wouldn't burn). After the chocolate cooled in the pan for a little bit, we put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it had already set up! We cut it into squares with a pizza cutter while it wasn't too firm and put it back into the freezer for 10 more minutes to continue setting. We thought it would be necessary to use crunchy peanut butter because that adds a nice, textural element since it's pretty rich. We've already had people in the apartment ask what we were making because it smelled so good in the hall!

This will be a new Holiday tradition in our house.  I had everyone asking me for the recipe.  It makes plenty to eat and still have enough to share with family & friends.  I used smooth peanut butter instead crunchy and I also used the white chocolate bark in place of the regular white chocolate.

I made this today for my Christmas gift baskets. I wanted something a little different from my usual fudge recipe.  It is not as rich as fudge, but still a great sweet treat! It was also a little easier to put together. This will be a keeper for sure. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is pretty good, but next time I might cut down on the amount of milk chocolate used (personal preference). I used white almond bark and milk chocolate almond bark.

Wow!! Rich, decadent, chocolate! This was not as hard as I thought it would be. But since it was my first time I was a little nervouse. I ended up not swiriling with the knife enough, so next time I will do more swirling. Other than that theese are really good treats!

I never heard of Tiger Butter before so I was curious enough to make it.  Turned out great even after using the full 20 oz. package of white chocolate.  I also melted the white chocolate and peanut butter in the microwave and after they were chilled I just broke them apart.  Very simple.  This will be added to my holiday recipes.

Delicious and shamefully easy.

I used the microwave to melt everything per the package directions and for my very first attempt at making fudge it went surprisingly well.

It's the middle of summer, I'm craving chocolate & peanut butter, I used Ingredient Search and found this recipe--love the name. Easiest candy I've ever made and one of the best. I'm not fond of white chocolate, but when combined with peanut butter, it becomes a velvety, buttery base for the melted chocolate. I was out of parchment paper, so I buttered a pan, but I will use parchment paper in the future. I echo the words of reviewer prissy, it melts in your mouth. Thank you Nancy for my new favorite candy recipe.

I'm from the Oregon Coast and there are many little tourist shops up & down Highway 101 who sell fudge and Tiger's Butter is always a featured flavor.  I can honestly say this recipe beats anything I've bought so far and it's sooooo easy.  Use quality white chocolate, it does make a difference.  I can whip up a batch in such a short time and I've started making it a required goodie in gift baskets.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Discovered this several years ago and make it every Christmas as a gift to family and friends
While making this for Christmas 2018 I decided to replace half the semi sweet chocolate  with unsweetened dark baking chocolate. I like my chocolate on the dark side

I make this every year. It is rich so the pieces cut small is ideal. I often use white almond bark and then a blend of chocolate chips (3/4 lb) and chocolate almond bark (1/4 lb). I have also used all almond bark but it is not quite as good.  I have also used creamy peanut butter but the little bits of peanut add that little extra. It just depends on what I have on hand and that is why I vary it, but the point is you can vary it and it still works!

made this yesterday for a get together and everyone loved it ! Once i got it all on to the parchment paper i place it in the freezer for about 30 or so mins... placed a piece of parchment paper on my counter  and when the candy was set  i took the ends of the paper and turned it over on to the paper on the counter. I was able to cut the back side ( it was nice and hard and cracked beautifly under the sharp blade) the front with it's pretty swirls stayed in tact.  Will make this again and again... so easy !  thanks bunches. Ohhhh...a foot note...i made mine as a peanut butter choc. bark  NOT a fudge... soooo yummy

I have been making this candy for years and absolutely LOVE it! So simple to throw together, but it looks like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen. I love giving this as gifts in a basket at holiday time. Everyone always looks forward to this delicious confection! :)

This was really good.  Made it for the first time this year for the Christmas "goodie" bag that I give all the kids.  Fast, easy.  I highly recommend using the microwave on this as other reviewers have mentioned.  Added the 1 tbs of shortening to the chocolate.  Crunchy peanut butter is a must!  Melts in your mouth!

Delicious and oh so simple!  One note for first-timers that I did not realize: don't try to evenly spread the chocolate over the top. It is the uneven pour that allows you to create the swirl effect. Even though I kind of messed it up in this respect, it was still too great!

Fantastic!  Absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved them!  The only thing I suggest is tomake sure you really stir them up good so they stick together.  If you dont stir them good enough you get a really hard top shell that doesn't stick the the white chocolate/peanut butter mixture.  Other than that, absolutely fantastic! I've made them 4 times already!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit, it didn't last very long at all! And it was ridiculously easy to make. The hardest part is waiting for it to cool down enough to cut up! I will definitely be making this often.

I used creamy peanut butter and chips for both the white and semi-sweet chocolate.  I used my grocery store's generic brand of semi-sweet chips...not the best quality.  Next time I will spend a few extra bucks for the better stuff.  Overall it was tasty, but a little rich for my liking.  Did not hold up too well in the CA heat...was kept indoors, but still got a little melty when sitting out on a platter during our party.  Some liked it, some didn't.  I think I will try making it one more time, but with the chunky peanut butter and better quality chocolate.

Just as I remembered from my mother's kitchen!  I made it with creamy peanut butter, and it was still great, although I think I will try it with crunchy as the recipe directs.  It would probably be even better with a touch of crunch.  Everyone loved it at my holiday party!

Remarkably delicious recipe! Wow! It really tastes like it came from a fudge factory. I brought this and 5 other recipes to my hubby's work as a Christmas spread and this was gone immediately. I'll make more for the weekend. Too easy not to.

Made these and sent to hubby's work for all the folks along with some other goodies and they raved about them.  Will be doing every Christmas now.  Followed recipe exactly and cut them into squares while still a little soft.  Melt in your mouth!

This recipe is super simple, quick, and yummy.  The chunky peanut butter gives it a different texture than most fudge, and it's nice to have something a little different.

This is so delictable! This was my first time making fudge and I never knew it would be so easy! I used chips for both of the chocolates. Followed the directions but put it in the freezer for 20 min. after preparing and then cut it into pieces. (before completely hardened) I love peanut butter & chocolate!!

Very good.  The chocolate on the top seemed a little too hard.  It crumbled when I cut it and sort of broke instead of letting me cut it into squares, but it tasted fantastic.

This was my first time making fudge and I think It turned out perfect. I used 1 pound of semi sweet baking chocolate and 1 and 1/3 bag of vanilla chips. Next time I will let it setup in the freezer for faster turnover time. I'm sure the people that will be receiving the fugde as gifts will love it!

I don't like chocolate, but everybody that eats this says it is amazing.  My only complaint is that it gets a little harder than a typical fudge.  Will definately be making every Christmas for my cookie trays I give away.

This recipe was very easy and the results were incredible.  Its like a Resse's Peanut Butter cup, but the texture is much smoother and melts in your mouth.  Very simple and easy to make, and its appearance is gorgeous.
