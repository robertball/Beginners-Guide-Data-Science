I brought this to a family dinner.  It was delicious.  However, my DH was expecting something gooey.  This is what he remembered butter cake as from his childhood.  This cake is not gooey.  It is rich, flaky & buttery.  Delicious.

Sooo good.  A little sugar on top would be good for next time.  I haven't had this in a long time and it came out exactly like I remembered it.  I baked it for right about 35min and it browned nicely :) Thanks for the great recipe!  My husband tried it today and liked it, too.  It's just how he remembers it being.  His grandparents are Dutch immigrants.

This Dutch Treat is DELICIOUS! It tastes like I used Almond Paste, but without the hassle and expense.I make this ALL the time. Don't even think of using margarine. It is quick and tasty. I usually brush the top with milk or egg whites. I've made it in the pie plate, sliced in wedges, and in a square pan, and cut into small bars. It is ALWAYS a hit!

Very Good.  Even my husband who does not generally like Almond flavor really liked this.  The texture (for me atleast) was more cookie like, but absolutely delicious!  I may try different flavors next time, like vanilla instead of almond.

This is AMAZING! Incredibly easy and such a great taste. A wonderful change from the standard cakes... I cooked for exactly 35 minutes and it was perfectly done. Please note the sides turned a golden brown but the top does not brown up so don't use that as your measure :) This stays at the top of my recipe box.

Wow!!  This was GREAT!  I have never had this kind of cake before but chose it because my husband and I love almond flavoring.  I didn't change a thing.  I only cooked it for the least amount of time suggested, 30 min., due to all the reviews saying it dries out and it was perfect.  If you don't like almond flavoring then I would imagine it would taste just as good with whatever extract you like.  It is just as it is described, a cross between a cookie and a cake.

I fixed this for a family dinner and it got rave reviews!!!  Then I brought the leftovers to work and the same thing happened.  The only thing I changed was the removal of the baking powder.  My mother never used that in her recipe and we are all from Holland.  Thanks to Allison for giving me back a recipe I had lost.  One more thing.  I only baked it 25 minutes and it came out perfect.

I've made this twice now, once back in February and then again today.  It is an alright accompaniment to a cup of tea but not something I would make for company or serve on its own.

LOVED this- thanks so much for the recipe! My husband's family is Dutch, and when he tasted this, he said it reminded him of his grandmother-- best compliment ever :) thanks again!

This is definitely a cross between a cake and a cookie. A little sweet, but I'm sure that is how it is supposed to be. I brushed the top with a little beaten egg and sprinkled it with slivered almonds before baking. When it came out of the oven, I sprinkled it with a little sugar.

I was born and raised in the Netherlands and have lived abroad the last couple years. I often make this for friends and it is always a hit. Buttery, flakey and with a delicious almond flavour. I usually double the recipe and make it in a 10inch springform, bake for about 45 min or so until done. I find the thicker boterkoek, the better it tastes. As per Julia Child, one can never use too much butter!

I give this 3.5 stars! Tastes very much like a sugar cookie. Good, easy, and you most likely have everything on hand.

This was very easy to make! I was however uncertain about whether it was the correct texture since I had never had it before. After removing it from the pan and cutting it, my fears were allayed.  I enjoyed this quick recipe, and although I really like the taste of Almond, in my opinion, the almond taste was really overwhelming.  Our dinner guest was openly verbal about it being too "almondy" :-( The texture however is really interesting, and nice for munching!  I will definitely try this again, but I will significantly decrease the amount of Almond extract. In my opinion just a hint of almond would make this the perfect coffee time treat.  Thanks for sharing!

I'd do this one again, only cut the sugar a touch.  Added slivered almonds to the top before baking.  More crumbly than I anticipated, so I'd probably take this out closer to the 30 minutes next time, too.  But, it's quick, easy and really good as is.

This is a really aeasy dish to make, and uses ingredients most of us have on hand. I tried the recipe as written, except for using Olivio, which I pretty much always cook and bake with, and it was very good. I feel so-so about almonds, and the almond flavor was strong, so when I made it a second time I substituted lemon extract, using 1 1/4 tsp. I also added just a pinch of salt. I really loved the finished product. It tasted like a lemon sugar cookie. And the reviewers who said it was even better the second day were right. We had some for breakfast the next day with coffee, and it tasted like something from a great bakery.

So tasty and easy to whip up! ActuallyThis is exactly the same boterkoek recipe I inherited from my mom,  EXCEPT to give it a nice top "coating", you are supposed to reserve a small amount of the beaten egg to lightly brush on top of the boterkoek before putting it in the oven. If you like, you can also add slivered almonds sprinkled on top.

This was pretty good, I liked it a bit more when it was slightly warm as opposed to cooled/room temp.  It was easy to make and I wouldn't mind making this again at some point.

I made this today after "saving" the recipe for three years.  Decadent!  I like almond but think perhaps it is slightly strong so next time I will use  just one teaspoonful.  The key words there are "next time."  And I do believe this would be just as good with vanilla.  Easy to make and bake.  Easy clean up.  Easy to eat and I think that will go well with my coffee tomorrow.  I gave it five stars because I had a hard time not eating more.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe!  I used a little less almond extract but other than that, followed the recipe and it was rich and was delicious!   And now gone.  YUM.

I would have given this 5 stars but the name is misleading. My husband and I thought that this would be similar to a dutch butter pound cake. This recipe is actually perfect for making kano coekjes (canoe cookies) which are another dutch dessert. They are typically long bar cookies with almonds on the top.

I made this for Monday morning coffee at my RV Park and everyone loved it.  Soooo easy and delicious!
I added an almond to the outside of each wedge.  (I baked it in a round pie plate)
