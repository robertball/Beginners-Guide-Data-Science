I have made these for years for catering jobs, but my method is so much simpler. It has to be quicker when you have to make dozens or hundreds. Rinse, drain and dry (on a towel) pea pods. I pop off the stems & slit open one side with a sharp paring knife.  I mix softened cream cheese with dill and mashed garlic paste.  Fill pastry bag, fitted with a star tip, with the cream cheese mixture. I just pop open the length of the pea pod as I get ready to pipe a scallop of cream cheese into the pea pods.  Beautiful piping looks sufficient as garnish but the peas sounds like a cute idea. If you garnish with peas, I would use fresh, dry peas, so they don't look messy. My method is really quick if you clean your peas in advance. There is no need to soak.  I could whip these out real quick.

I made these for my "sweet pea" baby shower.  Prepped pods as directed and between prepping, soaking and filling - I had at least 3 hours in this!  Wasn't worth the time and for a 30 person shower (double batch) and folks didn't really like them - had a ton left over.  Might be okay for a smaller shower.

I made these years ago.  They are delicious and fun to make.  Always a big hit.  I had to make double what I needed because I ate about every other one.

Just wanting to use up some cream cheese and a few pea pods, I found this recipe.  I just washed and dried the peas pods, didn't let them soak.  I just added the filling to a small ziplock bag and squeezed away.  A nice refreshing treat.

Really good. I made my own herb cream cheese and I did blanch and shock the little peas that I used for a garnish. These were so cute on the plate not to mention very tasty.
