It tastes exactly like it says.  My family loved it.  I wasn't fond of it though.  I wanted to make a German pancake and this recipe came up in the selection.  I chose it because the kids were starving and I didn't have 40 minutes to cook the other in the oven.  Flipping this over was an accomplishment to behold. Next time I would use smaller pans to make it easier to flip.  If you are looking for a light and thin German pancake...this is not it.  However, it is a great alternative to the regular pancake.  Have fun with it.  Add some vanilla or other favorite flavoring.  Enjoy!

this recipe is good, but the way i've had it before is scrambled. this eliminates the need to flip. also, add cinnimin and leave out the rasins. tastes good with yogurt and fruit to cut the sweetness

Good. My 16 year old daughter made this for her sisters for breakfast. They sprinkled powdered sugar on it, and drizzled a little bit of syrup.

I used this as a base recipe and added carrots, nuts, banana, and oatmeal.  I used 2 tbs peanut butter and no regular butter.  I got 8 large, fluffy pancakes.

Well, I thought this was a breakfast food not dessert; so that was my first mistake. A little of the yolk got in my egg whites, so those didn't whip up properly. But I didn't like the flavor; too sweet and they just didn't have any.....density to them.

I remember Kaiserschmarn from my summer vacations at the chiemsee, it was always my favorite treat. This recipe brought back memories of those great summers. Delicious with applesauce or just with powdered sugar.

Fantastic with syrup or applesauce. So easy to make as well. May replace my pancake recipe as I like the fluffier cakes. My son made this for a class project in German. Very easy for a teen to make!

I feel like the heat isn't right for the amount of time is needed to cook it, I burnt it the first time I made it. The second time I adjust the heat and it came out perfectly. But overall this is a very sweet dish that I loved making and eating!
