These were yummy. I did find it needed much more salt for me than just a pinch. I did think these were a little dry, but that it pretty common with veggie burgers. I will make these again and bake for a little less time and also add some grated onion to add some moisture.

Good flavor but dry. Used whole eggs and breadcrumbs instead of bran and no cheese.
