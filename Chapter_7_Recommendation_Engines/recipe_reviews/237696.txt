I made this for my office during a potluck.  It was a resounding success.  Several people came up to me and said that they are not bread pudding fans but loved this recipe.  I am minimally adept in the kitchen but I pulled this off really well.  It had a great presentation.

I needed a bread pudding recipe that called for sourdough bread.  I'm so very happy I found this recipe.  I made it for my coworkers, and everyone who has taken a piece has come back to my desk to tell me how wonderful this bread pudding is.

I made a few changes, because I had to.
1. Used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (I didn't thaw them, just threw them in with the bread)
2. I substituted 3 tablespoons aguafaba (bean juice - google it) for one egg, because I only had two eggs left
3. I baked for 40 minutes.

Next time, I will make sure I have all the proper ingredients on hand :)  Thank you for sharing your recipe Beth!

I used low fat milk in the pudding, added strawberries in addition to the blueberries, and used fresh strawberries instead of the creamy topping.  (My tummy doesn't tolerate much dairy.) It took a little longer to cook through.  We loved it!

Pretty darn good! I had to add 1 more tbs of softened butter than the recipe called for to get it to cream together, and I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. In my opinion it almost doesn't need the "golden sauce", as it is pretty sweet on it's own. Overall a good recipe and I will certainly make it again. Thanks!

This was outstanding. Unfortunately, the sugar, butter, egg, and milk mixture curdled after two attempts. Instead, I followed another recipe at this point. I place the sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk in a saucepan. I heated this until the butter melted. I allowed this to come to room temperature. I whisked the three eggs together and then whisked into the milk/sugar/vanilla mixture. I then pored this over the bread and blueberries.

I have made a blueberry bread pudding from a recipe before that was not quite involved but I will make this one again.  It is the best I have ever tasted.

Decadent. I used half the sugar and doubled the sauce :) Always a spectacular hit. Well above any other bread pudding I have tasted.

I had to bake this longer than suggested but it was just delicious. It was best just out of the over but pretty good reheated too!  I'm making it again to take to a friend's cottage.

I soaked cranberries in the juice of 2 oranges.  I also took the zest of the oranges and added it to the milk mixture along with 1 TBspoon of vanilla.   I didn't add any cinnamon.  I also sprinkled walnuts on top before putting in the oven.  Came out delicious with a very delicate flavor of orange and vanilla.  Really good.  More like dessert than breakfast  I poured all the golden syrup and put it in the oven.  It came out moist enough that it did not need additional syrup.   I also only used 1/3 cup of sugar.
