Beat a couple of eggs in  a bowl. After you coat the chicken with flour dip it in the eggs and then back in the flour. This should help hold the crust on better.

This recipe disappointed me.  I was having a Mexican Fiesta, and wanted to make fried chicken for those who didn't eat Mexican.  I wanted to make a dish that had a Mexican Flare, but this wasn't it.  The chicken cooked up very dark, looking like it was burnt.  Maybe, you should only use one package of taco seasoning mix.  The chicken was very, very bland, and messy.  It was too much mess for ordinary tasting chicken.  It wasn't worth the trouble.  I will not try this again, not in this fashion.

I followed this recipee exactly and found it messy.  The coating wouldn't stick and there didn't seem to be enough oil to fry it.  The coating was crunchy and flavorful, but it would have been nice to have it on the chicken and not stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I really did't care for this one. Sorry!

The second time I made this rather than use taco seasoning I used some adobo and rubbed it on the chicken then did my usual method of flour, eggs & milk, flour.  I was not impressed with the taco seasoning taste.  I made this for a family picnic and the mexican side said it tasted like taco bell made fryed chicken and the black side said it was a crime against chicken.  Also super messy!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought the seasoning mix was a little strange in the breading.

This was great, and oh so easy.  I have tried to make Mexican fried chicken over the years, and never got it quite right.  I think it is the buttermilk that helps tenderize everything and hold the coating on.  I will make this again.

Try adding bread crumbs to the flour, and fry in a bit more oil.

I also had a difficult time with this recipe.  While the batter was delicious...it ended up in the bottom of the frying pan and not on my chicken.

Great concept! I made this with Chicken Thighs. I marinated overnight like stated, then dredged in the flour/seasoning mix but I did more of a deep fried chicken (1/2 in oil in skillet) until golden brown then put in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. This is how I do all of my chicken to allow the fat to drain out. It was very moist and delicious. I will make this often.

This was super tasty, but the coating didn't get crispy and didn't stick too well to the chicken. I think a double dip is in order, with an egg wash, to keep the coating on this chicken.

We loved it!  We did use an egg wash and finished it up in the oven, but the spice level was perfect, the chicken was juicy and tasted great.

This recipe is AMAZING but I didnt make it as written.  I didnt have the time to marinate it.  I then pounded the breasts  flat to an even thickness.  Mixed milk with 2 eggs and beat to coat chicken.  Then breaded the chicken in flour and taco season mixture.  After frying breast to a golden brown, I put them on a lined cookie sheet, covered them in shredded cheese and baked for 15-20 mins at 350.  THEY WERE FANTASTIC !!!!

Pretty easy and flavorful.  I made this with the 'Roasted Vegetable and Cornbread Stuffing' on this site.
