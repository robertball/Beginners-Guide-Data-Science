I know I'm cheating by rating my own recipe but it is the only way I can add some comments about how I have changed this up since I originally posted it.  Like many of the reviewers, I always add some sugar to this.  I also add a splash of balsamic vinegar or red wine (or both!).  I usually omit the onions unless I adding meat to it, but that is because my daughter is a purist and can find a microscopic piece of onion in her food. :)  If you have fresh basil available, I absolutely recommend using that instead of dried.  I take advantage of the summer basil and fresh tomatoes by making huge batches of this sauce each year and canning it for use throughout the year.  The variations I just described are  what go into the jar.  I then add whatever we are in the mood for when I heat it up (roasted red peppers, meat, onion, etc).  As a starter, I still think the recipe as posted is a great starter recipe.  The great thing with this kind of sauce is that you can get creative and find new ways to dress it up.  Enjoy!

Love this and would recommend to the onion haters to use a Vidalia and pur√©e it instead of chopping.  No sugar will be needed because it's so sweet.  And yes, use fresh basil.

I rarely buy premade sauces.I think I have found the best one for me. I like mine one the thick side, so I used a small can of paste. but its the flavor thathas me hooked! I did add a little sugar because I like it a little sweet. perfect basil flavor.

Delicious and simple.  If you don't like your sauce "chunky", use an immersion (hand) blender to make it smoother or put in a regular blender.

Wow! Firstly, I did make a few changes but only subtle ones to suit my family's taste. I had original rotel, but did not have the bigger can of rotel crushed tomatoes so I substituted what I had which was a can of four cheese spaghetti sauce. I used one and a half tbsp of basil and half of a tbsp of oregano, because while my family likes seasonings we are partial to oregano and I was honestly worried three tbsp would be too much for us. I used 1/8 cup sugar as others AND the OP suggested, a few dashes of  red wine vinegar (the OP suggested balsamic vinegar or some red wine or both, so I subbed for this) and I also threw in some sweet Italian sausage, diced bell pepper and only 1/2 of one small onion diced. THIS WAS SUPERB.  This sauce as a base was a perfect starter and the flavors marry so well after simmering for that :30. Omnomnom

This is a good basic starter sauce. I can't imagine  a sauce without onions, but that is just a personal preference. Of course, if you really don't like onions, then don't use them.

I, too, never liked onions in my sauce, but found that a very finely chopped or grated shallot gives it great flavor.  Also, 2 cloves of garlic?  I'd start with 4 and go from there. Lastly, you should saute the garlic and shallot before adding the tomatoes.   A  little crushed red pepper and fresh parsley really top it off nicely.

This looks delish if you desire a chunkier sauce.. I personally like a super smooth sauce.. Basil in pasta sauce is a must.. but NEVER onions.  So I would omit the onions.  and I too would add a little suger or even splenda. If I were making Chili then I would add onions.

Very nice as a basic marina, but like others I added a few things: about two cups fresh diced tomatoes, about 3 tbsp brown sugar, about I/3 cup Merlot, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp chicken stock bullion (I used Better Than Bullion). And no onions as suggested. This is probably the best sauce I've had, that I made

Good starter but terrific pasta sauce is not so simple tasting. Add 1 tablespoon dried oregano and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to add a richness and more "complex" taste.  Also, whenever dried herbs such as dried basil or dried oregano (my recommendation) are added, simmering about an hour helps the flavor develop.

So o started making it, then I read the comments. Lol. I had fresh basil on my deck, but didn't know how much to use, so I stuck with the dried stuff. I added 2 tbsp of sugar. Some balsamic vinegar, 3 tbsp of butter. Still waiting for the family to try; seeing how I started this late at night. (Nightshift worker).

This turned out very good.  I added the sugar recommended in the reviews.  I accidently purchased tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes but needless to say it worked out well just the right consistency.  I used it over spaghetti in the Chicken Parmesan bundle recipe

This is a tasty, easy sauce to make for spaghetti.  I like to reduce the dried basil to one T., add 1 tsp of oregano,  and sometimes I add browned ground beef if I am not doing meatballs.  Also, before mixing, I use a hand blender to puree all the tomatoes so the sauce is smooth.

I have made this but I used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes with all of the ingredients and preservatives that I can't begin to pronounce.  More healthier too.  Just remember to add 1 Tablespoon of sugar - to cut the acid of the tomatoes.

After I turn off the heat I add extra virgin olive oil ( The amount of oil is based on how much you want). It gives the sauce a good taste and avoids that "tomato paste" effect that you can sometimes get using canned tomatoes.

I had a couple cans of diced tomatoes that I wanted to use and some wonderful fresh basil, so I made this.  I also added some sugar and it was really good.  So easy!  I added hot italian sausage pieces and served it with hot garlic bread to make it a hearty meal.  I will make this again for sure.

This was a great basic sauce.  I omited the onion as suggested and added a little sugar and balsalmic vinegar. Definitely opted for the fresh garden basil.  Everyone enjoyed!

Good basic recipe. I followed the suggestions to add some red wine, used fresh basil and some fresh oregano. I also doubled the garlic. It needed some salt- next time I will add this. I will double it next time and freeze for future meals!

Recipe as written two stars. Bland, bland, bland. Attempted to boost flavor with additional garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and a little sugar. Still barely edible. I'll keep looking for a different homemade spaghetti sauce this wasn't it.

Thanks for this easy base tomato sauce recipe.  In a tablespoon of EVOO, I saut√©d the onions along with one finely chopped carrot to add some extra veg, plus I used both fresh and dried basil, dried marjoram, oregano & parsley.  I did add about a 1/2 - 3/4 cup of a red zinfandel, only because I had some open.  When I tried it, I thought it needed some salt so I added about 2 teaspoons.  Other than that, I thought it was great, quick & easy!  Will definitely make again.

Did not make this sauce.  When I read the header I thought this would be a tomato sauce from fresh, vine ripened tomatoes.  When I saw the recipe with canned tomtoes I was chagrined.  Does anyone have a fresh tomato sauce recipe or do I need to just stay with the sauce from the pasta puttanesca recipe with fresh tomatoes, anchovy paste, kalamata olives, garlic, capers, sugar...was hoping for something NEW, kinda WOW.

I make a similar red sauce but carrots are a must. No sugar necessary. Carrots sweeten the sauce. Grate or finely chop and saut√© in olive oil with onions before adding tomatoes. This is how I make my Marinara sauce.
