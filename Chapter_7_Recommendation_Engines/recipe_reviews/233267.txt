Hmmm . . . you really can't roll the dough into 1-inch balls with your hands, that's for sure.  The dough is way too sticky, and that would have been a huge mess. I chose to use a 1" cookie scoop, which worked great. Here's the thing, these do not flatten as they cook. They are more like a muffin ball than a cookie really (as the recipe is written). Not a bad thing, just want those that are expecting "cookies" to be prepared. So, for the 2nd sheet that I baked, I dipped my fingers in flour and flattened them, so they would be more cookie-like, and also cook more evenly, as my first tray (the ball ones), were done on the outside, but slightly underdone in the middle. Worked better, but you could see some of the flour on the cookies, even after baking. 3rd sheet, I flattened again, but this time dipped my fingers in coconut oil first, which turned out to be the best of the 3 sheets. The look more like a pumpkin cookie! I got 34 cookies using the cookie scoop. They taste good (very dense), but not sure I'd make this one again.

I made this for friend gathering and everyone loved them. They loved the size and shape too. Mine weren't dense because when I added the pumpkin puree in the bowl with the spice cake mix, I mixed them until combined then turned the speed up on my mixer and "whipped" the mixture, then I added the spices. I forgot to add the sugar but they were still extremely good. Thank You for the recipe. I'll be using this one again.

I tried this recipe as written and while I liked it I decided to make my own custom recipe. The size of the spice cake mix is now 16.25 ounces. I also added 1/4 cup of canola oil, 1 cup of pumpkin puree and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. It is a very sticky dough so I used a small cookie scoop to form the cookies. As these cookies do not flatten very much during baking, I used the tip from a previous reviewer and lightly oiled my fingertips to gently press the cookie dough down. I also pressed a few chocolate chips into the batter before baking. Cookie has a nice crunchy outside and chewy inside.

I took Mariah's suggestion and mix the ingredients VERY well, before adding the chips. Also, since the batter looked too stiff, I added one eg to the batter. The cookies have a cakke-like texture, not too sweet. Although the chips added sweetness, the next time I will up the sugar amt a bit. I got 50 cookies out of this recipe.

Super easy. I went heavy on the cinnamon and nutmeg because I used a white cake mix instead of a spice cake. I used white chips instead of chocolate, and omitted the drizzle because the white chips were quite sweet. My batter was too sticky to roll,  but it worked well as a drop cookie.

The cookie didn't cook at the way through. The dough was difficult to work with.
