These muffins taste amazing.  The only problem was that the recipe requires a leavening agent, or you need to use a bit more flour than stated in the recipe.  The taste of these by far outweighs the lack of fluffiness -- my mother that HATES peaches loves these muffins!

I made these muffins exactly as the recipe is written and they are wonderful. The cream cheese filling is the best part. Even though they don't raise up too fluffy, I will make them again.

I made a few adjustments based on what I keep in my pantry:
*subbed cornmeal for oat bran
*skipped the walnuts
*white sugar
*2% milk
*regular cream cheese.
I also doubled the amount of peaches. 
So yummy!

I work at a Califoornia Farmers market and I decided to make them for all of the vendors at my local market. This recipe is delicious and everyone liked them. Great job!

I thought this was really good as far as a healthy muffin alternative. I followed the receipe to a T. I am having a brunch and plan to use it as part of my menu and will use it occassionally as a regular breakfast item.

This was really good. I made it without the cream cheese filling though because I didn't have cream cheese but it was still very good and soft. Thanks for this recipe.

After making these muffins, I've decided fresh peaches do not belong in muffins. 2 stars given for the basic recipe, which is easy to put together & without the cream cheese & peaches is a good "base" recipe to add to. But there is very little flavor in these (surprisingly) & I even added additional cinnamon & nutmeg. Not impressed.

I tried these muffins and wasnt impressed.  The cream cheese mixture could have used a bit more sugar and they were extremely moist to the point they had to be refrigerated...a bit bland.

These were great!  I like smaller muffins, so I made 18, but use a bit more cream cheese if you do this.  Also, if you don't want to keep yet ANOTHER flour type in storage, use your coffee grinder to grind up the oats and it makes a great substitution.  I also ground in some bran cereal for extra fiber.  Thanks for a winner! :)

My family was mixed on this; two threw them out, but the rest liked them!  I like the oats and peaches combination! They went together easily, and baked up nicely.

Awesome recipe.  Tasty, easy and leans toward being healthy.  I added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and used raspberry jam instead of cream cheese/brown sugar for the filling (one teaspoonful).  I also increased the amount of diced peaches;  I used ~ 1 cup.  I used frozen peaches but made sure they were well drained upon thawing.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon.  These muffins were great and were so pretty as the jam peeked through the cracks in the top of the muffin beside the diced peaches and hearty oats.  Definitely a keeper.

very good. I also used a mini loaf pan for a variation.
