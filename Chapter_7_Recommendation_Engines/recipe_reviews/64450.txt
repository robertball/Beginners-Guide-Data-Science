I followed this recipe exactly and it was very easy to make and required very little preparation.  I was a little nervous when I first started cooking it because it seemed like there was a lot of cinnamon, but it was okay after it simmered for an hour.  Also, this recipe isn't very salty, so you might want to add more soy sauce or salt to it so it isn't so bland. This recipe is a good starting point, but it seems to be lacking a lot of spices and flavor.

This was great - so tender and a good, simple flavor. I used boneless pork spareribs - they were super fatty so I took off as much fat as I could and boiling them initially as suggested was also very helpful. I followed the instructions except didn't add any salt or pepper. I let the pork boil for about 2 hours but when I tried it after 1 hour, I could tell it was already very tender.

These were very tender but there wasn't a lot of flavor. Apart from doubling up on the seasonings, I don't know how to improve this. Marinate the ribs in something? I won't be making these again. Thanks anyway.

Not bad.  Could have used a little more taste though.

I'm a real pork lover & make this dish regularly with just a couple of revisions. I use pork loin roast instead of ribs and - for the rich flavor some reviewers found lacking - I reserve and strain the par-boil water and use it to simmer the recipe. Do not boil longer than 3-5 minutes or it dries out the meat. You want it to simmer in the other flavors until fully cooked. I often substitute the green onion with sweet onion slices, as that's what I have on hand. Use one T. ground ginger if you don't have fresh ginger - it's just as good - and I double the cinnamon. The 1/4 tsp. pepper may be a bit hot for small kids. Both my grown sons, who've never cared for pork, really love this dish. I serve it with Sesame noodles and pea pods as sides, for a great Asian-style meal.

I tried this last night for dinner and used 500 g back ribs and 250 g pork chops that I sliced into inch-wide strips, to make 8 servings. I didn't have any rice wine in the kitchen, so I substituted it with sesame oil. My family loved it! My brother is picky but he said it was really good. Didn't expect the meat to be so flavorful because I didn't have an hour to simmer it, but it came out great. Will definitely make again.

I have to admit I did use country style ribs instead of the spareribs so my recipe could have changed because of that.  The ribs were dry in spite of being in all that water.  There were suttle flavors so the kids liked the meat.  Next time I may try the fattier spareribs and see if that makes a difference.

I read the reviews before I made this and decided to change it to add more flavor.  My changes were:
3 Tb. Soy Sauce,
1 tsp. Sesame oil,
3 Tb. brown sugar (instead of the white sugar),
2 tsp. Siracha,
3 Beef Bouillon cubes added to the water and
1 yellow onion sliced thin (instead of the green onions).
I kept the rice wine and the water the same. The cooking method and time were the same as the original recipe also. 
These variations made the dish delicious! My kids loved it.

very tasty, and the cinnamon is a nice touch.  i cut down the water a LOT based on the reviews and this probably helped with the flavour.  i quadrupled the recipe for 4 lbs of ribs but still used on 2 cups of water.  simmered covered x 1 hr in a dutch oven and then reduced for another half and hour uncovered.  to cut down on the fat, i scoop out the ribs and drain the oil from the sauce before serving.

I made this in my slow cooker. I just put all the ingridients in at once and let it cook all day. It was so flavorful and delicious and tender. Even my picky two year old ate it! This is definately a keeper!

5-star considering my tweaks to the recipe. the liquid tasted very bland, once mixed together. It had no flavor, really, and I was concerned the meat wouldn't be savory enough and taste like it was just boiled in plain water.  So, instead of the measurements called for, I used 2 T of soy sauce,  2 T of sweet rice wine (I couldn't find regular rice wine), 1 T of rice vinegar, and omitted the sugar and salt called for in the recipe.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  After cooking the meat in the seasoned liquid until it was tender, I removed the lid and allowed the liquid to condense and thicken a bit before serving.  I then served it over rice - it was awesome, my entire family LOVED it.

Turned out great!  Didn't have any cooking wine so I used 7up which is common for tenderizing meat in a simmering liquid. Used a bit more dark soy and no light soy. Used raw sugar and sea salt. Loved the little bits of chopped ginger. Wish I'd have added more. Dressed a clay pot with rice with this dish and it was amazing!  Used the sauce at the bottom of the pot and put it over the rice in the clay pot before returning it to the oven on high for a good 10 minutes.

Added a bit of dried garlic powder and baked it instead of braising. It came out pretty good.

I made this for our Chinese New Years celebration and it was easy. The only changes I would make would be to add some soy sauce and a slurry to make more of a brown gravy otherwise it is a really good recipe

I replace the cinnamon with 3 star anise for a Beijing style flavor.
