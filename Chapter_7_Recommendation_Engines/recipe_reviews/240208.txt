Actually haven't made it yet but had to respond to snarky Clink. If you'd read the recipe carefully, after 10 mins you flip the chicken and cook for at least another 15 mins. Plus, directions are for a convection oven, which cooks faster, and proper temperature  was also listed. Before attacking someone's recipe and giving it a low rating, try reading it carefully all of the way through.

I understand that for the most part this chicken is made to use in other recipes.  I overcooked it.  I have problems getting chicken right if I put it in the oven to bake.  I'm much better on stovetop where I can monitor it easier.  I baked it in a pan lined with foil and totally forgot the last step of adding water to pick up the browned bits.  I made my own seasoning using Creole Seasoning Blend from this site---a yummy version.  This leftover chicken will definitely make a great sandwich or salad.  I will make this again on stovetop because it does make for an easy and delicious way to make it!  Thank you, Always Cooking Up Something!

I made this this evening and was in a bit of a hurry and didn't need an intensive recipe with a long list of steps or ingredients. This fit the bill perfectly and it turned out tasty too! I used skinless boneless chicken tenders and Geoffrey Michaels Cajun Breakdown seasoning. I used a lot more than a pinch though as I sprinkled it liberally over both sides. I sprinkled these with kosher salt before cooking. This was simple, took a little over 30 minutes, and was tasty too. That makes this a winner in my book. I skipped adding any water to the pan since my tenders will still not completely thawed out. Nothing stuck to the bottom and it wasn't necessary. This is a great easy recipe, thanks Always Cooking up Something!!!

Wow. This was so easy and turned out delicious! Rather than rub the olive oil on I sprayed it on both sides with my oil spritzer, sprinkled with sea salt, and a fairly heavy sprinkling of Old Bay seasoning and a dash of black pepper. I baked in an aluminum pan for 45 minutes and after removing the chicken I followed the recommendation to add water to the pan to make some delicious juice. I may have been able to cook for a shorter time - recommend checking after 30 minutes.

I sprinkled garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, black pepper, and table salt on chicken. Soaked it in warm water for twenty minutes and sprinkled spices on again.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful. It really helps to brine the chicken 1st. Otherwise followed recipe accordingly.

Good recipe - unfortunately I read the seasoning label after loading up my chicken - it's MSG.  Next time I will try Montreal chicken or spike for flavor...otherwise it's a great guideline for tender chicken.

This is my go-to recipe for simple chicken breasts. I cook about 6-8 breasts on the weekend to use for lunch and various recipes for dinner throughout the week. Don't have a convection oven and found that this takes about a total of 40-45 min in a reg oven on 400 degrees.

This turned out REALLY well. The chicken was super moist and tender, and the flavor was amazing. I tried it exactly as the directions follow and it was amazing. I will continue to bake my chicken this way from now on. I also tried it once adding in veggies (carrots, etc) into it when the chicken was almost done and that turned out even better!

For Janice Wilson Homola: I bake this in a regular oven all the time. 375* for 20 to 25 minutes per side works for me.  Living alone, I bake the whole package and freeze the rest so I have chicken on hand for salads, sandwiches or any recipe that uses pre-cooked chicken. Use any seasoning you like, but NOT fresh herbs as they will burn.

Super easy and turned out fine. I used sage because we also had cornbread sage stuffing. Took about 45 mins in regular oven since I don't have a convection oven, but I also was using whole breasts that were huge. Result was moist and flavorful chicken.

Love this recipe as it was pretty simple and straightforward. We just got done with dinner and I got some more going in the toaster oven for during the week. I did have to cook a little longer, however the taste was phenom and the tenderness on point! Great go to recipe. 
(I used the convection setting in my toaster oven)

I loved this recipe. Chicken was tender. I cooked it just the way the recipe called for.  I did use a cast iron skillet. When chicken was done I removed as suggested and kept warm and added a little water, butter, chopped Vidalia onion and garlic, then sautéed spinach in the skillet. Placed chicken breast on top of spinach. It was wonderful.  I will be making this again and again. Thank you Always Cooking Up something!

Delicious and moist. I used a lot of minced garlic in the olive oil for dipping the chicken. I added a little Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

Simple and very good! I followed the recipe except used a tsp of Emeril's Essence. It is my favorite Cajun seasoning. My son commented that it was good and he doesn't say much, unless he doesn't like something.

I really dislike when someone will rate a recipe lower that they change ingredients. I did use a combo of paprika, cayenne pepper, and Cajun seasoning instead of Creole.  It was great. Went off without a hitch. Kudos on a great recipe.

Super easy. I had one chicken breast that I wanted a basic recipe to cook off before it expired. This recipe fit my requirements. I put a dash of olive oil in a small cooking dish, then sprinkled cajun seasonings (or it could be any other seasoning blend) on the top of it. Then flipped it over to add more to the other side.

Then I cooked it on the one side for 10 minutes, then the other side for an additional 15 minutes. Perfecto!  Definitely will use this recipe in the future.

Btw, I did not have a convection oven, and the timed temperature still worked for me. But the chicken was thinner than regular breasts, and if I did it again, I'd probably pound a regular breast just to get it a little thinner to cook a little quicker.

I made this the way the recepie described because that’s what you do when you make a recepie. If you changed the recepie then your rating is invalid because it’s not based on the recepie anymore, it’s based on your recepie. If you think it should be different then post your own recepie and let people rate that.

Made this tonight. The chicken was very juicy.  Next time I'll add a lot more spice because a pinch was so little that all I tasted was the salt (which is no doubt what made the chicken so juicy).  I LOVE salt, so that was okay with me, but I'd just like to taste more of the other spices too, so I'll add a lot more next time.  Thanks for the recipe!  I can see using this as a basic recipe a lot, and varying the spices used with the salt.  Someone mentioned they used thyme, which sounds delicious!

I cooked this in a regular oven in at 400 degrees for 10 minutes on each side. My chicken breasts were sliced thin so they cooked quickly. I used the cooked chicken with the recipe for Chef John's Chicken Soup recipe, and it turned out delicious. I thought the recipe as written was a bit salty, which was fine for the soup but might be problematic otherwise.

It turned out real good!  I followed the directions just as they were written and for the first time used the convection button on my oven.  So I also learned something from this.
Thank you,

This was the juiciest chicken breast I have ever made in my life!  I don't have a convection oven, and my oven tends to undercook, but for me, 165 degree meat temp was 30 minutes at 400 degrees in a regular oven on a foil lined broiler pan.  I didn't have Tony Chacheres on hand (we do love it though!) so we used Mc Cormick's Cajun seasoning instead.  I used coarse sea salt sprinkled on, and Also threw in the smallest dash ever of McCormick Sriracha Black Pepper Seasoning -  WARNING this stuff is VERY HOT so literally just a few flakes or you might ruin your chicken - use very sparingly.  - I saw this site partners with McCormick so I found it amusing that I happened to use their spices!  I pretty much followed the instructions, EXCEPT, at the 10 minute mark when it came time to flip them, I also brushed a little bit of BBQ sauce on both sides too.  Instead of 15 minutes on the second side, I did it for 20 minutes and checked the meat temp, and for our oven - a total of 30 minutes at 400 was perfect.....  again our oven undercooks, so I strongly suggest using a meat thermometer - I have become very dependent upon mine.  OH YEAH  - I did not use chicken breast halves, I used WHOLE chicken breasts - and they were pretty thick/meaty ones too.  But everything else about this recipe helped me bake the best chicken breasts I can remember!  They were so moist, even though they were white, not pink, on the inside and had reached propert temp.

I think this may be the first review I've posted on Allrecipes. This chicken was very good. I added some garlic powder and onion powder. Otherwise, it was just as the recipe calls for. The chicken breasts were very large, so I extended the time just a smidge. The chicken was tender and juicy, very nearly fork-tender. I might like a little more seasoning next time (salt & pepper). Will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight and it was superb.  I used one boneless skinless for myself and bought a bone in skin breast for my husband never dreaming that the boneless skinless  could possibly be so moist and full of flavor.  
I do have a convection oven and I did use it.  I used Old Bay seasoning and followed the directions as otherwise indicated.  This was really moist and full of flavor for how super easy it was.  I can't wait until I make it again.  Using the drippings to make a sort of sauce was a nice touch.  The husband was deligthed as he doesn't usually care for chicken necessarily.  Thanks for a great recepie.

I find this to be a foolproof temperature/time combo for chicken breasts in my convection oven.  I otherwise never use the convection setting.  Great thing to cook on Sunday to have cooked chicken on hand for salads etc during the week

I needed a super easy chicken breast recipe (I don't have a tenderizer either) and found this one.  I also don't know what the Creole spice is in the recipe so I used sea salt & thyme.  I have made it twice now and it came out perfect each time, tender and plump and delicious!  I just read another review that warned not to wrap in tinfoil - not to let the tinfoil touch the food because of aluminum, I will use that tip next time I make it!

One of the easiest and quick chicken so far.   Put raw chicken in ziplock bag with oil and all seasons.. Let sit for a bit.  Lay single layer in cake pan. Awsome!! I used chicken tenders so were thin but baked quickly and VERY MOIST. Ate on buns for summer meal.  Kids ate em like crazy!!!   Was asked to make always

I always brine chicken first.  I added more spices to include smoked paprika, garlic powder, herb de Provence, fresh ground black pepper.   I use large  12-14 oz. chicken breasts, so they can take up to  50 minutes when using a regular oven, not a convection oven.  The size of your chicken breasts, with or without the bone, determines the time it takes to cook.  Use a meat probe and it will turn out every time!

Amazing! I have an old oven, so I had to add more time (approximately 12 minutes extra) and I didn't have a broiler pan so I cooked it on a cookie cooling rack over a cookie sheet. Seemed to work! The chicken was moist, but the skin still had some texture. Might turn up the oven near the end next time and spray butter on it to crisp it up.... but that's probably better for anon-skinless recipe.  Either way, this is honestly the best roasted chicken I've ever made, and I'm confident I can make these more for meal-prepping

Gave this recipe a try tonight and was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. I had two enormous chicken breasts that had been in the freezer a little too long, and I worried they would be dry if I pan-fried or simply baked them. Another reviewer had suggested brining for chicken breasts. So once mine were thawed in the microwave, I liberally salted them with sea salt and added enough tap water to their juices to have them submerged. After 30 mins sitting in the fridge, I pulled the meat out of the water/salt mixture and placed in broiler pan, applied the olive oil and shook on some Lawry's Seasoned Salt and put them in the conventional oven at 400. I baked them 20 minutes on the first side, flipped them over and did another 17 minutes. I removed the breasts to slice up, added the water to deglaze the pan, and served them up together.  This will now be my go-to base recipe for chicken breasts: they were moist and very flavorful. I may even back off on the Lawry's next time.

This was amazingly simple and delicious.  I used a heavy dose of the Adobo seasoning from Bobby Flay's new book "Bobby Flay Fit".  I used foil on the bottom of the pan to make the cleanup easier, but it kind of ruined the option of making the jus at the end.  Next time I will skip the foil and try the jus.  My husband does all the after dinner cleanup anyway ;).

Outstanding recipe and so fast and easy to prepare! Only alteration I did was adding some crushed dried rosemary, salt and pepper and a dash of hot sauce instead of the Creole seasoning, which I did not have on hand at the time. Next time I intend to try making this so simple recipe with a touch of Piri Piri sauce giving my chicken a touch of Portuguese cooking!

This was nicely flavored, and very easy. I don't have a convection oven, so it took 10 minutes longer for my (enormous) chicken breast halves to reach 165F.  Three and a half stars.

The chicken was good once it cooked. I followed the recipe very carefully. Proper temperature, proper time, proper amount of chicken and used a convection oven. The chicken did not cook in the prescribed time. Ended up having to cook it for an additional 10-15 minutes. I will try it again with another batch later, but the time is definitely off. Still good though.

I used a little bit more seasoning than a pinch. This turned out really well. I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Simple, juicy moist and delicious! I made as stated and also made another version for my little ones, using everything in creole mix EXCEPT the cayenne and onion powder and it was still very good (paprika, sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, thyme and oregano, then a squeeze of lemon and a touch more sea salt at the end). 10 minutes on one side, 14 on the other made four perfect chicken breasts. I didn't add the water, seemed unnecessary...

Chicken came out moist and juicy with tons of flavor.

Love how easy it is.

An excellent recipe that requires little prep time and tastes great. There's a wonderful light crisp and just enough juice to make this a better-than-expected eat.

I think this is a very good, quick method. Moist and tender. However, I found it too salty as written. Next time I'll cut the salt in half.

Pretty easy - all you have to remember is 400 degrees, 10 minutes, flip, 15 minutes. Everything else is up for grabs. For example, I didn't have creole seasoning. One time, I tried the Hungarian approach using paprika and garlic powder. Another time, I tried Italian with dried basil, oregano and garlic powder. Definitely used more than a "pinch".  Note that for these times, you need a convection oven. Without convection, it would take longer.

Every time I make this recipe my chicken comes out perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe. No more overcooked chicken breast’s. They come out juicy every time and the flavor is really good. I don’t use the salt, I just season them all over with the creole seasoning.

I'm new at this cooking thing. My wife works at the Alzheimers Association and teaches at a local university. We were eating out five nights a week. So  I figured if you can read you can cook. Most important, thanks to each and every one of you for your recipes and comments. Last night I wanted to make a chicken Caesars salad. This recipe worked out well. I baked one breast longer than the 25 minutes. Served it with warmed bakers bread. Thanks again. Jack

I made this a few weeks ago and will make it again today for dinner. Quick and tender and leftovers are just as good! For spices I used a basic blend I found in one of the reviews with a little extra cayenne for my heat loving husband. Do not over cook, remove from the oven, tent with foil and rest for ten minutes or so. Mmmm!

Awesome recipe and tastes great. My roommates love it and love how the chicken is juicy. I opted to cook mine in casserole dishes with aluminum foil. Still turned out great and made for easy clean up. Keeps the chicken nice and moist which we all love!

Sooooo good, soooo easy!  My chicken breast was quite thick so I pounded it down so it would cook more evenly,  threw on some spices that sounded good & baked it in a regular oven (not convection) for the time & temps stated I n the recipe.    I think that no matter what kind of spice you put on the chicken it’d turn out delicious.  Served it with asparagus.   Very tasty!!

Thank you for this simple recipe! For the first time, I was able to bake chicken without it coming out dry.  I followed the baking instructions, but added 5 extra minutes because I’m paranoid about not cooking chicken all the way through. It turned out great!

Super simple!!! 
Didn't have creole so I used sazon seasoning. 400 degrees F for 20 mins then fliped for 10 more. My five year old asked if we could have it every single night. Paired with steamed sweet potato and steamed broccoli

I've used this recipe several times. It's fast and easy and you can use any seasonings of your choice. I baked 4 today with celery salt, garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper. I'll use them for chicken pot pie tonight and chicken noodle soup over the weekend. You do have to adjust the cooking time if you're not using a convection oven but it's no big deal. I keep it in my favorites!

My husband loved the chicken! The oven is my new best friend! No more slaving away at a hot stove, dying of heat exhaustion! Just slap them in a pan, huck some seasonings on them, drop kick them in the oven, walk away, and have enough time to come up with funny reviews ??

I’ve made this several times with really good results each time!  I followed the recipe as written with two minor changes. The first change was the use of a foil lined cookie sheet instead of a broiler pan, because I didn’t have a broiler pan. The second change was was a change of seasoning (I used McCormicks  Grill Mates Roasted Garlic & Herb), because I didn’t  have the seasoning mentioned in the recipe . It still turned out great! Highly recommend!

This was so simple and tasted great. The recipe is a great starting point. I added Italian seasoning and Adobo seasoning and the family loved it. Have fun with the spices/seasoning! Would be great with rosemary or whatever you're feeling that day. Will use this again for sure.

I didn’t have the creole seasoning called for, so I substituted salt and pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. I also sprayed the broiler pan so nothing would stick. Because my chicken breasts were so thick, I baked them for 15 minutes on each side. The internal temperature wasn’t 165*, so I baked for an additional 15 minutes. DONE, simple and so good. I have a micro-convection countertop oven and I use it more than my full size oven. This recipe fits my needs and lends itself to experimentation with different spices.

I enjoyed this recipe. Great recipe to build off of. It was a bit salty but that was probably my fault, I will go a bit lighter on the next go. Will definitely try again and continue to play with this recipe.

Made it twice, both times in a regular oven. The first time I followed directions exactly not Realizing that it call for baking it in a convection oven and the meat was juicy and moist. The second time I added 5 min onto cooking time to ensure internal temp  was 165.  Second time it was dry and chewy. Maybe for the third time I’ll do 10 min then 18 min. Very good and from here I can add whatever sauce I want!!!

I was looking for the quickest and easiest way to bake some chicken breast pieces that I have had in my freezer for a while but have had no inspiration to cook. This recipe worked really well! Instead of using a Creole seasoning, I added an Italian seasoning to the chicken, as well as the vegetables I baked to go along with it, and that was delicious. It may be the differences in ovens, but mine took a bit longer to cook (about 20 mins on each side), in order to make sure there was no pink in the meat but to still have plenty of juiciness. I also did not do the last step with adding the water to make a sort of gravy, but I plan on doing that next time around.

This is my favorite method for meal-prepping a lot of chicken at once. After the chicken is cooked, I shred it and freeze in individual portions using the red (protein)  21 Day Fix container to measure a serving size. I leave out the seasoning so it's more versatile for future recipes that call for cooked chicken.

DELICIOUS!  Never thought to cook skinless, boneless chicken breasts at 400 degrees, but I did.  The chicken was so moist, plump, tender and every bite flavorful.  This will be my new go to recipe for chicken breast.  Like the low calories too!

This is an easy recipe that turned out great. I did not have creole seasoning, but I made my own from seasonings in my cabinet and stored the extra seasoning for next time.

I made a variation of this.

I didn't have the Creole seasoning, so I improvised with some barbecue seasoning that I had.

It turned out well. my mother-in-law liked it, at least.

This is so simple, I can't believe how good it is!  I had rather thick chicken breasts and 25 minutes at 400 was perfect, then I covered the pan with foil and let the chicken rest a bit before we ate it.  Sooooo juicy!  I used salt, Tony Cachere's seasoning and also sprinkled on a little Paul Prudhomme's poultry seasoning.  Try it!  You won't regret it.

Excellent.  I must confess however that as no creole seasoning is available in the frozen country North of you, I substituted curry and garlic.  Superb!

This is the simplest and greatest recipe for someone that does not want lots of instructions and ingredients. It was so easy to follow with very few ingredients. Instead of Creole ingredients, I substituted with Hispanic seasoning. Came out superb.My hubby was extremely happy at how good it came out. Two thumbs up!

Baking is the best way to cook chicken breasts. You can customize the seasonings that you desire. My husband and I like parsley and basil and a pepper blend. Good recipe for meal prepping chicken!

Chicken breasts are back!!  For several years I gave up on chicken breasts, bc I could never cook them to perfection.  They were always dry.  Anyways, I found myself with extra chicken breasts and tried this recipe .  I used lemon flavored olive oil and seasoned with adobe and poultry seasoning.  I was shocked at how tender, tasty, and juicy the chicken was.  Several of my breasts were undone after the cooking time, so I left those in 5 additional min and it all turned out great.  Happy to have found the correct, simple chx breast technique!!

I went to the store today to get the frozen grilled chicken I like to use for simple dishes, and they were out, so I made my own following this recipe. I will never buy frozen again! I didn't have the Creole seasoning, so I used equal parts: garlic powder, paprika, oregano, salt, pepper and cooked it exactly as this recipe said. (I'm glad someone pointed out "convection" cook because I missed that at first.) It is the best!

Simple recipe--I increased the temp by 25 degrees to 425 F and added maybe 5-10 more minutes since I was cooking in a regular oven. The chicken was tasty and so easy to throw in the oven for some lazy cooking. I served with 5 minute couscous and some green peas. Lazy cooking at it's best! Thank you!

We didn't know what size breasts to buy. The kind we ended up buying were really big and weren't done in the time it said. Other than that, though, it was really good and easy to make.

This is my "go to" chicken recipe.  We have it often.  I change up the   seasonings, and use lemon flavored olive oil.  The cooking time does vary according to the size of the chicken breast so check the internal temperature often. It is always moist and flavorful and so easy.

I bookmarked this recipe to remember the preheat and cook time.  Cooking chicken breast this way comes out perfect and tender.  I think the salt and olive oil (along with flipping it) is crucial because it retains moister making them juicy and tender.  I eat chicken for my diet a lot so I add different sauces to it to change it up.  Franks red hot, teriyaki, bbq, etc.

The reason I love this recipe because it is a good "outline" to follow to get some yummy/moist chicken.  Don't have the seasoning recommended?  Use what you have - I have used lemon pepper or seasoning salt, or you can use recommendations that other reviewers have posted.  I'm giving it 5 starts because it is easily modify-able to what you have on hand and makes quick and yummy chicken!

This is such a simple recipe but gives outstanding results.  I don't have a convection oven so I adjusted by adding a few minutes to the time, and relied on my meat thermometer.
I did use a bit more seasoning, but changed nothing else.  The chicken was so moist I will use this as my basic chicken recipe again and again!

Very good and simple baked chicken breast. Had marinated in Italian dressing so didn't use spices, but very good basic recipe. Chicken was juicy, yet cooked throughout. Ideal for adding to other recipes. Will use again and again.

Being from Louisiana I never use a smidge of Cajun seasoning. But I failed to realize my husband bought the bold flavor instead of original. My mouth is on fire but in the best way! Will definitely make this again.

Baked the chicken in conventional oven per recipe. I did add garlic powder for extra flavor and oh my gawd, this recipe is amazing. Highly recommended. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The recipe is so simple yet the outcome is culinary exquisite. Thank you!

Simple,  juicy,  delicious.  I used my convection oven, 400° F, however the breasts were pretty larger.  I used my digital oven thermometer by wand until it reached 165° F.  It took a bit longer, but not a problem. Simple or not, I'm grateful for this recipe.

My new weeknight go-to recipe for chicken! Easy, fast and delicious. I used what I had - Cajun seasoning and Kosher salt - and was generous with both. Did not over bake, and did the flip. Juicy and tender!

This is delicious! I never knew how easy and delish baked chicken could be! I added a little minced garlic. Legit good, especially for someone who has issues cooking chicken breasts! I made it twice just to make sure the first one wasn't a fluke. This will be a new staple in our home.

Great recipe to hold onto specifically for cooking time and temp. Comes out moist and perfect every time. You can use any spice mixture. I like to the Mccormick spice blends personally.

I used my own spices (I had already marinated the chicken when I found this recipe).  I used a broiler pan, the kind with a perforated pan on top of another pan.  It allowed the marinade  to drip down and the chicken to get as close to barbecued as possible.  I followed the instructions but then broiled them for about five minutes.  Perfect.  This will be my go to recipe from now on for baked chicken breasts, although I'll try to remember to brine them like I saw in other recipes.  Thanks!

Chicken was very tasty and moist.  I do not have a convection oven, so I cooked the chicken at 350 degrees F for approximately 40 minutes.  I used large skinless boneless chicken breasts and used Emiril's recipe for creole seasoning and applied it liberally -
2 1/2 tablespoons paprika.
2 tablespoons salt.
2 tablespoons garlic powder.
1 tablespoon black pepper.
1 tablespoon onion powder.
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper.
1 tablespoon dried oregano.
1 tablespoon dried thyme

This recipe was so easy and wonderful. The chicken was very tender and juicy. I made two very large chicken breasts, and they were done after 30 min in a regular oven (not convection).I skipped the water, but sprayed the pan with PAM prior to baking instead.

Almost foolproof technique. Just use your favorite seasoning or brine recipe. Oven temp or time may vary slightly but with a good oven and meat thermometer you should be able to dial it in easily. My parents freezer broke down so I ended up making enough chicken for an army. Every batch was perfectly cooked and consistent.

Quick, easy, and my wife asked for seconds! I "enhanced" a bit by using pesto olive oil, and dusting with parmesan cheese, but otherwise it was as you wrote it. Will make again...

Made this twice within 1 week! So tasty and so simple! We love it! I cut my chicken breasts in half (length wise) for thinner chicken and cooks even faster! Great go-to quick meal!

This is my first time cooking anything other than soup. My boyfriend needs to change his diet so I checked things out here. Found this and tried it. It was perfect! He and my mother loved it. Didn’t have any Creole Seasoning so I made a batch. Also, before cooking I sprinkled some dried basil leaves on the chicken before putting it in the oven. So wonderful!

I  added some Garlic powder to this recipe, and I didn't have Creole seasoning so I used Greek seasoning. After flipping the chicken, I cooked it for 20 minutes instead of 15. Afterwards, I didn't even have to add water to the pan for gravy. I'm definitely using this recipe again.

The flavor was very good.  I did have to increase the baking time by 15 minutes in my convection oven.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I'm one who always over cooked chicken in fear of under cooking it. This has turned out perfectly for me every time! I make several breasts at a time and freeze them to use in fettuccini alfredo, for my chicken enchiladas and for chicken wraps. However, it is also great alone as the main dish as well!

After reading the recipe through a couple times, i decided to give it a shot.

HUGE success.

Only thing i omitted was the salt (as my cajun seasoning already had salt in it).

Came out perfect. now on the food rotation. super easy, super tasty.

The recipe does not specify boneless, skinless chicken-- you need to watch the video to see that. I had breasts with bones and skins, so it took longer. I put olive oil on the bottom side of the breast, then put a chunk of butter on the top side after turning. You could add a bit of lemon juice to.the sauce or deglaze with white wine for variety.

The chicken was fantastic.    The only downside:  I would have put the oven lower.    Paired it with some  Porcini Mushroom Farro and Carrots.   Easy cleanup too.

I cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us. Also cut down on the oil and salt but was very liberal with the creole seasoning. Next time I will go a little lighter on the seasoning as it was very spicy. The chicken was juicy, tender, and tasted so good. I will definitely make this again.

The chicken breasts I used were a little thick, so I cooked for 12 minutes on the first side and 15 minutes after flipping them.  I allowed them to rest out of the oven for 5 more minutes.  Thankfully, I cut into the thickest portion of one and it was still a bit pink.  I had to return them to the oven for 5 more minutes.  I did not use a meat thermometer as the recipe suggested - my fault.  This was a good, quick method to make chicken for a weeknight dinner.  An unexpected rain storm made me have to change my plans of grilling the chicken outdoors.  I gave this 4 stars because they were a bit more dry than I was hoping, but that was likely due to returning them to the oven.

My issue:  salt and then creole spice that is primarily salt.  Should be label salt chicken.

Omit the salt or make your own creole spice omitting the salt.  Would never make this with double salt.

Concerning convection oven, simply alter cook time and/or increase temp.  Even grill outside on a grill.  Any method that can cook and brown/crispen skin will work.  

Regardless of method, you need to get chicken to a specific temp per area of chicken to avoid undercooked meat.  

To be snarky, do you cook often or eat out most of the time.  Might be safer eating out.

Have made this same thing but with pork chops. Delicious. Could also maybe cook this in a crock pot, with some chicken stock instead of water perhaps. I'll need to give them both a try.

So yummy and a new favorite way to cook boneless, skinless breasts! Convection will ensure they stay super moist. And really, you can use whatever seasoning/spices you wish.

Delivered exactly what I expected. I never baked chicken in the oven before, always fried it in the pan, and this worked well, much easier. You can easily build on this recipe to do anything else. Your imagination is the limit.

Flavor was good, and yes, quick, but, what is not quick was cleaning the broiler pan.  That took longer than the cooking. I guess you can use foil if you don't want gravy or sauce.

I thought this was a very easy and good recipe.  The chicken turned out perfect and was delicious.  I didn't have any creole seasoning, but I did have some Bangkok seasoning from Penzey's.  It did the job and I will be making this on nights that I just need a good quick meal.  This would also be good to cook ahead of time and to keep in the fridge for chicken salads, etc.

Chicken meat tastes like chicken, and nothing can change that; however, when you make chicken with a spice as potent as Creole (which I made from scratch, by the way), you expect more.

I usually avoid boneless skinless chicken breast recipes because I end up with tasteless cardboard . Not so with this recipe. It was very juicy and tasted even better the next day,  and it was so simple and fast to prepare and cook. I would have given it five stars if the seasoning had been better. I found it lacked depth. I added fresh thyme to the marinade, and I used a cast iron skillet to brown both sides before finishing off in the oven. Instead of water, I added a little flour to the drippings and cooked it for a minute, then added white wine. After the sauce was reduced by about half, I turned off the heat and stirred in a tablespoon of butter.

I always enjoy reading the modifications people make so I can customize to my liking. This recipe is such a great starting place because the basic recipe leads to superb moist chicken. I was looking for a recipe to bake large batches of chicken breast to be used in my daily salad. I cook them, portion out sizes and then pull out what I need each day. Instead of all the olive oil I simply sprayed with an olive oil mister. And since I love Old Bay seasoning I seasoned liberally with sea salt and Old Bay. Baked as suggested (using the convection feature helps tremendously.) I use rather thick chicken breasts (Costco has wonderful organic breasts at a reasonable price) so it took longer than the stated time, but I just used a meat thermometer which alerted me when it hit 165 internal temp. These breasts were delightfully moist and flavorful. You can use whatever seasoning you like best but the temperature and method here are spot on. Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy and straight forward, delicious. I buy chicken breasts that are fat, so I increase the cooking time 10-15 minutes.

I always laugh at all the "tweaks" - I substituted this and added this, that, and the other, but I had to make a substitute for the Creole seasoning.  :)  My husband is having side effects from radiation therapy, so I just used salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary.  It was the juiciest chicken ever - we sliced up the leftovers for sandwiches today.

i used lemon pepper for my seasoning but followed the cooking instructions and it turned out great.  I think this recipe would work well with what ever your preferred seasoning is.  will definitely make it again.

It's a little meh to me on its own, but I chopped up  the chicken breasts made using this recipe and added them to jambalaya, and it was amazing.  Definitely something I'd recommend for adding to other recipes that call for the chicken to be pre-cooked.

So easy and sooooo delicious!!
The broth was amazing.

The cayanne was a bit too much for my taste personally, but the chicken was cooked perfectly, and I barely even had to touch it! This is great if you're on the go.

I did not have any creole seasoning but had some dry onion soup mix which I sprinkled on top of the chicken and when I flipped the chicken over sprinkled the remaining mix. Very tasty!!!

Thank you! I followed the simple directions except I used olive oil in spray form on top and bottom which made this meal zero effort. It was SO tender, juicy and EASY!  This will be my recipe for baked breasts forever. I will use this recipe to cook chicken in bulk then slice in strips and freeze portions so they can easily be used for salads, sandwiches, soups, etc. And of course, you can switch up the seasonings. My family loved it.  I served it with a simple simmered seasoned sliced cabbage. Perfect way to feed my family a nice meal on a weeknight even though I was tired and short on time. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed it to make even clean up a breeze. Don't overcook the chicken. Once it's preheated to 400, put it in and follow (trust) the directions. :)

I made this chicken in a pinch and it was perfect! I used all the spices plus onion and garlic powder. I also baked it for about 5 mins longer after flipping it because I had some pretty thick pieces. My 5 year old loved it and will definitely make again!

WOW I am not usually a fan of skinless chicken breasts being they normally are dried out unless you brine first.These were fabulous! Super tender,juicy and  adding the drippings at the end gave so much flavor.Only problem I had was big pieces of salt left in the drippings in which I will cut the salt back next or use a finer ground sea salt and maybe heat the dripping in a pan to break the salt down.Thanks for sharing.

2/7/17 - made this today as I needed to have cooked chicken quickly for a recipe and didn't want to wait on my husband to get home and grill the breasts.  Came out perfectly!  Two large breasts and followed the directions to the T.  Some pink juices when I removed it but let it set for a few minutes and started carving it....it was perfectly done.

Very tasty chicken breast recipe!  I made this tonight for my hubby and I and followed the recipe exactly.  The bake time was bang-on and the chicken breasts were tender, juicy and the creole seasoning was delicious!  I made my own creole seasoning using the recipe on this site too under "Creole Seasoning Blend" by Joslyn.  I just cut down the recipe to make less than for 20 servings to 2 or 4.  The creole seasoning would be fantastic on BBQ'd back ribs, I am thinking!  I will definitely use this recipe again soon!  My hubby loved it too!  I served the chicken with quinoa sauteed with chopped onion and then added frozen broccoli florets to the quinoa for the last 10 minutes or so and added grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese and it all went together very well!

I made this tonight. It's very simple to make and I was surprised the chicken was so tender. I served it with baked sweet potatoes and corn on the cob. Very tasty! I'll make again when I really don't want to spend a lot of time cooking.

I just made this and it's delicious! I was a little worried at first because I snagged a bite of my son's while I was in the kitchen cutting it up for him and it was a little dry. I saw so many reviews talking about how juicy it was, so I was disappointed. 

Then I remembered I put my broiler pan back in the oven to warm up the juice since I let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. I poured some of that juice on and my mouth was in heaven! 
I went easy on the Creole since I wasn't sure how my kids were going to react, but they LOVED it! I can't wait until the next time I make it since I'll be able to use more seasoning. 

I also LOVED how quick and easy it was. This will definitely be a staple in our house!

Even my picky kids ate it up. I cut the chicken lengthwise to make them much thinner, used some moroccan spice, and grilled on my BBQ 4 minutes a side.  I served on a bed of rice, peas, and lentils and a side of cheese and tomato salad. The entire mess was drizzled with garlic and lemon tahini sauce. Very easy to overeat.  Very yum.

Super quick, easy, satisfying, and moist. Thank you! (I tend to not measure exactly at all times so it's probably my fault that it tasted just a bit too salty.) I cut the breasts into slices and ate over rice.

Delicious and easy!  Make sure you flip it after 10 minutes and don't over cook it

This, with simple barbecue chicken spice (la Grille), and little potatoes, was the easiest, tastiest, most popular dinner I've made in a while. Why do I bother trying to be more creative?? This was simply delish!!

We loved this quick chicken recipe! It was simple with few ingredients. I did everything except the water and scrapings. I also added chicken and seasoning salt to it. The chicken turned out tender and juicy! An absolute repeater!

Simple, fast and tastey. I did broil the breasts in the oven for a few minutes when they were almost done to make it a lil more appealing.

Yes I will indeed make it again! It was a little salty for my taste but my husband and family loved it!  He doesn't care for chicken at all! I used bone - in, skinless chicken!  Used bacon grease instead  of what the recipe called for and didnt flip it! Baked it for 50 mins.  I  think I will use either less salt or different salt next time because I just shook it on,  I will sprinkle it on by hand next time and if it is still too salty for me I will use good old table salt. And I did use aluminium foil and it came out so tender!

I omitted the sea salt, and substituted McCormick Perfect Pinch Rotisserie Chicken seasoning (from Walmart). I was pretty generous with it. I also used a TruTemp all-metal thermometer that you can leave in the meat inside the oven, to make sure it reached 170 deg F.  Worked perfectly! I had to cook about 15 minutes longer. Chicken was just right and plenty juicy. Froze a few pieces in plastic cling wrap, and they also re-heated just fine.

I didn't make any changes. Cooked exactly as instructed and it turned out fantastic! My husband isn't a big chicken eater, and he loved it made this way. It was very juicy and flavorful. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe .

I added some seasoned salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried Italian herb seasoning and paprika to this recipe. I also covered the pan with foil before putting it in the oven. The end result was delicious! The chicken was very juicy and tender!

The baking time was spot on and the breasts did not dry out. By adding garlic powder, sea salt, and lots of pepper, I improved the taste. I suggest any of you trying to consider adding your favorite seasonings to enhance the already decent flavor. You can pour a little white wine in the pan to make a good gravy. Enjoy.

I made these to go in other recipes.  I was concerned the chicken might dry out... But it's very moist!  I used the tin foil tip which I think helped a lot.  It has a nice flavor and will be a great addition to my other recipes.  Added plus: super easy!

Delicious! I had some time to kill so i brushed the chicken with soy sauce instead of olive oil, seasoned it and let it marinate for an hour in the fridge before baking.  This was the juiciest chicken breast ive ever made. I hate chicken breast because its hard to keep the moisture in, but this came out perfectly.

This is a wonderful quick chicken to cook up!  My husband and I love it and make it often.  I made the creole seasoning from another recipe from this site, and I sometimes use the leftover chicken to put in a stir-fried rice recipe (also from this site).  I don't have a convection oven, so I use a preheated oven and just make sure the temp reaches 165 degrees before I take it out.  It takes a bit longer, but worth the extra 5-10 minutes or so.

The chicken was very good; I did not read the recipe as well as  I should  have and did not halve the chicken, so it took much longer to cook- @45 minutes.  I cooked until the temps reeached 165 and the chicken was juicy.  I think it all depends on the rub you make.  I pulled from a recipe from this site.  I will def. make this again!

I am HORRIBLE at making stove top chicken. This recipe is the one I come back to every time I want chicken for dinner. I use my own spices, (mainly lemon pepper or garlic) and it always comes out wonderfully!(:

This cooking method yields excellent results. I think the timing and the flip are the key. You can adjust the seasoning to your liking as long as you have at least salt and pepper.

Amazing Recipe! I use Olivari Mediterranean Olive Oil Extra Virgin and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. Flipping at 10 min is crucial. I like to put some baked potatos in before handed (rubbed with the same oil) and then half way through add the chicken. Its so good, I've made it 10+ times already.

This was really easy and very good. I added black pepper and garlic powder and a little paprika.  OMG   I followed exactly with the exception of about 2 min longer to cook and I did extra seasoning.   Thank you

Used Italian seasoning instead of Creole (for allergy reasons) and I added some pepper. Had to cook them an extra 15 min. because they were slightly frozen when I started. My chicken breasts were deliciously tender and moist. Definitely a go-to for cooking simple breasts. (Served with rice and mixed veggies for an easy weeknight meal).

I used chicken cutlets and had them marinating overnight in red wine vinegar, black pepper, garlic salt and a spice blend. Cooks quite nicely!

Was VERY good and moist!  I did sprinkle on some garlic & onion powder.  I only had 2 big chicken breasts, so I cut the salt in half.  I was VERY generous with the cajun/creole seasoning as we love spicy!  My 12 yr old son says it's a KEEPER!

Great method. Chicken was very tender. I used a different seasoning blend to suit our taste. Great for preparing extra for lunches.

This is a great way to cook chicken and have it come out tender and juicy. You do have to remove it from the oven before it's done because it does keep cooking after you take it out. Exactly how long, you'll just have to experiment as it does depend on the size of the meat, the oven, etc.
