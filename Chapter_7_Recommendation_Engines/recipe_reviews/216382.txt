Awesome idea!!! I did change 2 things (which is why it didn't get a 5 star) Instead of ketchup and hot mustard, I added BBQ sauce and a bit of hot wing sauce for kick.  SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!  And great heated up with cut up hot dogs mixed in.

I've never made baked beans before, usually I just open a can and heat them up, but I think from now on I'll be using this recipe instead! Very delicious!!! I brought this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. I only gave 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used maple baked beans instead of pork and beans.

This is not a recipe I'll make again. I didn't care for the taste of the mustard, and I prefer a sweeter taste by using a little brown sugar.
