I live in Sweden,but I am from the States and yes this is a staple in every house. The recipe for chocolate balls is on every package of oatmeal here. The only difference between this recipe and the original is the melted chocolate. These are just as good without the melted chocolate, it is an extra step that you can skip....Or not...  Var så god!

Great!.. 5 stars for no-bake, tasty, chewy and for making me eat oatmeal!..  I wasn't sure if I'd like oatmeal raw!. I was worried they'd be hard to chew but they wern't; tomorrow they may soften up a bit more but I like them  as is!.. I rolled about half in the coconut and then some in chocolate sprinkles and some in powder sugar; I also used "Lindt 85% Cocoa Bar" (melted) instead of baking chocolate because I had some.  I added about 1T of rum in the last half of the batch for the grownups; the rum/powder sugar ones were my favorites!  Thanks I'll make these during the holidays!..

My husband, who is from Sweden, loved these chocolate balls.  He said it reminded him of home and was so excited when he tried them because they tasted exactly how he remembered them.

I gave these out as part of my Christmas cookie platter to family, friends and neighbors; and it was everyone's favorite.  Best once they sit and meld flavors for a day.  Yummy :)

These are a treat I remember as a child as well, and have been looking for a similar recipe, and this is it! I added a touch more strong liquid coffee, and some coconut in the mix as well. They turned out superb, I know everyone will love them as much as I do.

Quick, easy and delicious! Perfect for the holidays! I topped them with melted chocolate chips and then sprinkled  with coconut. Another idea would be to add a whole almond to the top or middle of each. Yummy!!

I am half Swedish and this IS the first recipe I learned! It is always a hit at parties and with family. We would roll these in pearl sugar (available at international stores or IKEA) and keep these in the freezer and eat them frozen, which everyone in my family still prefers. The pearl sugar adds a nice crunch to the treat.

We love this recipe-always double it. 
To increase nutrient density (in school lunches daily):  
We replaced 2 of the 8 cups of oats with ground almonds. 
Use Colonial Rosewood cocoa powder-high in anti-oxidants. 
2 cup sucanat (dehydrated cane sugar with all the trace minerals intact.  It is light brown but not brown sugar) 

Cream organic coconut oil and butter-2 cups then add oat mixture to mixer alternating with melted chocolate mixture.

Chocolate mixture:  1/4 cup agave, vanilla, dark chocolate pieces--We use 70%. And coffee. [cup of boiling water to 1/4 cup ground organic decaf; let cool. Refrigerated extra for next batch]  
We do roll them in coconut-finely ground.  I mash them into the coconut then roll.  If chocolate got too hot and mixture is to soft, refrigerate for a bit, it will get harder.
Love your tongue and love your body food--yumm  
Great recipe to play with.

I rated these a 4 because I thought they were a pain to form into balls.  They were sticking to my hands and rolling them in coconut was a joke.  I did not get to taste them however, because my daughter dropped the glass bowl I had them in and they all landed on the floor at church...

These are a perfect treat if you are looking for something that is not overly sweet!  Very simple to whip up a batch (although messy to make) and the kids love them.  I rolled half the batch in coconut and the other half in powdered sugar....both ways are a huge hit with my Swedish in-laws!

Yummy ! I was looking for a chocolate fix and these sure did the job ! Very good ! Viva Sweden and thanks so much for sharing this recipe !  The only tip I would have is to make sure you have enough plates to put them on because your hands are going to be black. lol

These are wonderful, but dangerous!! I can pop way too many in too short of time in my mouth. They're great for potlucks and I always get rave reviews. Save only a few for yourself at home because you'll find yourself popping one in your mouth every time you walk by :)

Instead of strong coffee, I used instant coffee.  These taste great.  I just wish there was a better way to make the coconut stick on these!

These are DELICIOUS! They are easy to make, a little messy, and good without the baking chocolate. I think it is something kids would like to make because they are fun to make, and I like rolling them in coconut. If you like chocolatey, coconutty, soft desserts, and getting your hands messy, try making these!

These were great!  I did end up with dough that wasn't holding together (I might have spaced out and added too many oats first, so don't assume it's the recipe's fault) and added an additional 1/4th cup of margarine to offset it.  

I also ran into the issue with the coconut not sticking, but after adding a very little amount of hot water (tablespoons of H2O?) to the dough it stuck much better.  I think our house was a little cold and the cookies starting solidifying too quickly, so the hot water re-melted the chocolate and margarine. I added even more hot water and extra instant coffee to the last half, and ended up with a much stronger mocha flavor (but a bit of a 'blob' shape from all the H2O making the dough too wet).  Next time, I might intentionally add extra instant coffee right off the bat - I loved the 'mocha' flavor!  but as written, the coffee isn't really tasted, it just adds a subtly richer flavor to the chocolate, which is nice for kids (I used decaf instant coffee).  I will definitely try with rum around the holidays, when we have some adult guests to share them with.

These were great and very simple to make! I coated mine with icing sugar.. quite festive :) Reminded me of snowballs.  The only thing I had trouble with is that the dough wouldn't stick together at first for me. But I just popped the mixture into the deep-freeze for 30 minutes and all was well!

Yum! Seriously. I've tried at least one other chocolate and oat no-bake cookie from this site and figured they just weren't for me. But this one is great. I made a half recipe and didn't have coffee, so I "doubled" the baking chocolate to compensate for flavor and added 1 teaspoon water for moisture. The balls came together fine but I had trouble getting the coconut to adhere. Not sure how to fix that, but I wasn't too worried about presentation. Sweet, chocolaty and full of texture. Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe! These were really fun to make (super messy!) and the recipe makes a ton, which is great for a party. I coated some of mine in powdered sugar, cocoa powder, coconut, and nonpareils and they were gobbled up really quick. I'll definitely be making this again!

WOW!!! These are absolutely delicious!!! I couldn't put enough exclamation marks. My boyfriend is Swedish, we live in the U.K and thus our trips to IKEA always include our favorite chocolate balls. We tried to make them once while in Sweden and not even comparable.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

note: I always melt half a chocolate bar and add slightly more butter.

This was my first time making any kind of chocolate treat from scratch.  So simple!  I had to put my chocolate mix into the fridge for a little bit before shaping it into the balls though.  So delicious though! Definitely going to make again sometime!

Made this twice! Kids love it. Did not use any sugar or coffee, these are for kids after all! Use a healthy dollop of honey as a natural sweetener. I rolled some in shredded coconut and another batch in chopped cashew for some texture. 

Easy one bowl no-bake healthy snack for the kids!

I  was born in Sweden and let me tell you that these are the must have for holidays,everydays,some days etc... but have you ever tried pearl sugar? it is a must have for these. You roll them in pearl sugar instead of coconut. It balances out the dark coffee and chocolate flavor with a sweet crunch!

Good moisture. I'm glad that they made something Swedish. I have a love for the gorgeous country, and it's reassuring that someone remembered it. The chocolate balls are identical to the ones in Sweden.

yummy - but I'm a bit confused. I used a food processor to chop the oats fine, added the sugar, cocoa, and 1/3 c coconut (to hide from family that claim not to like it). When I added the other ingredients, it was not doughy. So I added more coffee. And more coffee. I'm guessing I added about 1/2c coffee until it became doughy. It easily scooped with a melon baller. Strangely, while we all liked them, none of us thought it tasted much like coffee. Again - yummy! but if you are wanting a lovely chocolate-coffee taste, then you need REALLY STRONG coffee (or use instant, as one person suggested).

These were great and super easy! The oats I got were like Red Mill super chunky so I ended up adding 1/2 c. flour to get the dough to stick together better, but that's probably my fault. My daughter hates chocolate (I know, right?!!) so I modified the recipe and made half of them with butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. They are also super delicious!! I can't believe I've never heard of these before, my great grandparents are FROM SWEDEN.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! Everyone who tried one loved it. I've made this recipe a lot because it is just the best. I didn't have any coconut on hand when I made these though but they were still absolutely amazing!

I made these as directed, except I ran the oats through a food processor for approximately five seconds so they would be a slightly finer consistency.  I did the same with the coconut, for approximately a minute.  This recipe made approximately 72 balls rolled one inch in size.  I did not have any troubles forming the balls or getting the coconut to stick.  I am giving this an "okay" rating as they were a little on the bittersweet side for me -- I would have preferred a sweeter taste.

I love these with the coconut but not with the sprinkles like some of the pics show. Great recipe as written.
