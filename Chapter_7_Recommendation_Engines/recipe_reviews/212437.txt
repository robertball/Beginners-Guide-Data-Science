Yum! This was so good.... I just made a few changes; instead of rolling up jelly roll style I just formed half of the meat into a rectangle and sprinkled the cheese and bacon on that, then I put the other half of the meat on top. I also added jalapenos in the middle. I didn't have any Swiss cheese so I used Mozzarella on top. It is now one of my husband's favorite meals! I will definitely make this again.

I was dieting when I cooked this for my husband but he LOVES it!!! He went on and on for days.  In his opinion it is the perfect meal and the best dinner I ever cooked!  Thanks for the recipe! I made it with extra lean gound beef and I wouldn't recommend it because it is very hard to form the loaf.

I agree with WOW! This is hearty and delicious. I used mozzarella instead of swiss and it was beautiful melting over the meatloaf. Serve with extra BBQ sauce and oven browned new potatoes cooked with the meat loaf. A definite winner!

Well this is great! and my husband did love it!  I made some adjustments based on what I had on hand and a few by choice.  I only had 12 oz. bacon and I baked it since I find it turns out more evenly cooked.  I added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix maybe a couple teaspoons.  I used 1.5 lbs ground turkey and 0.5 lbs beef.  I subbed crushed saltines for bread crumbs and shredded cheddar/jack/mozzarella mix for cheddar.  For the glaze I used our usual meatloaf glaze since my husband really likes it (1/2 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 T lemon juice, and 2 teaspoons mustard).  For prep I recommend reading the instructions on the Cheeseburger meatloaf recipe to get a more detailed outline of the "jelly roll" technique.  Mine was really sticky and I was so glad I had the wax paper to help with the rolling.  I baked it in a 9x13 glass dish, put it in for 30 min and then glazed and placed the bacon on top and returned for 30 min.  I used a thermometer to time it (beeps when it gets to an internal temp of 160 and that happened almost exactly at an hour).  I did not top with cheese and I am glad I put the bacon in earlier since it was not quite done at the end and I so I broiled it for a couple minutes to crisp up.  To be honest I don't think it needs the bacon on top, especially after all the bacon inside.  I would definitely make this again!  Next time I will try to keep some of the cheese away for the edges so to cut down on leakage (even with the pinching of sides).

Wow! Definitely not the norm when you think of meatloaf. As soon as I mentioned "man loaf" to my husband and the bacon and cheeses it had in the recipe, he was all for it. I was a little skeptical at first, but I have to admit, it was absolutely delicious! The whole family loved it, and I will definitely be making this again in the near future!

Huge hit at my man filled house! Other reviewers were correct in saying the swiss formed a hard crust on top. Next time I may skip the bacon on top and add mozzarella only towards the end of cook time. Thanks!!!!

I used this recipe last night with a few additonal ingredients adding bell peppers, garlic salt, and used Heinz 57 sauce in place of the barbeque sauce. My family loved it.  It was the best meat loaf I had ever put in my mouth....Thanks for the receipe...

Great Meat loaf, Added diced jalapenos to the center filling as well as more of the BBQ sauce to the center, which added moisture to the final product.

This was excellent.  I didn't drape the bacon over the top like the recipe states, I simply mixed in all in.  I also didn't spread out the meat and roll it up.  I simply used a big bowl and spread it as thinly as possible inside the bowl, added the cheddar, then folded it over and pinched the ends.  I also used Mozzarella instead of Swiss, it is very hard to find shredded swiss.  I feel like the flavors went together well.  Whoever said it reminded them of a giant bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce is spot on, but it also has a meatloaf taste to it.

This artery-clogger is worth the time, effort, and adverse effects on your health.  A far departure from the drab, traditional meatloaf, the manloaf has everything a man, or my teenage daughter, would love in a meal, with none of the fussy extras. I love the added kick of jalapenos, but in fact the recipe needs no improvement.

Made this exactly according to instructions but my guests did not care for it -- said it was too greasy for them.  My husband said not to make it again for him but it would taste good chopped up and put into spaghetti sauce.

All I can say is this tastes like a big bacon cheddar burger. I used the real bacon pieces that are sold by the salad dressing because I was pressed for time. It came out very flavorful and my boyfriend enjoyed it. I had to bring in leftovers to work for everyone to try and it got rave reviews.

It was very good.  It's rare that I make something that a 1 year old, 4 year old, me and my husband all like!  Granted, it's not very good for you.  (Pretty greasy) I balanced it out with lots of vegetable sides so I didn't feel so bad about it, lol.

This was a good meatloaf, even though it was very greasy and bad for us! I tried to make it a little healthier by adding chopped spinach, green peppers, and mushrooms to the mix. Overall it was good, and a big hit with the man!

I loved it, except the shredded swiss on top. You really have to like swiss--and I only used 2 1/2 cups. It was too much swiss, and it became very hard like a crust.

Great, except for the last cheese on top which formed kind of a crust that was hard to cut through. But excellent flavor and moistness!

I thought this was good but next time I'll make a few changes.  I found it difficult to roll so if I choose to try that next time I think I'll refrigerate it after I flatten it out since working the burger made it pretty flimsy and it wanted to fall apart on me.  Next time I may just make it in layers instead.  The other change I'll make is using the entire pound of bacon to stuff it with instead of putting it across the top of the loaf.  I don't think it really added anything different and it was good inside the meatloaf.  I'll still use the barbecue sauce and swiss cheese on top but leave off the bacon.  Overall I thought it was very good but it could be easier to assemble and still be just as tasty.

Great flavor and execution on this one. Love the way it looks, smells, and taste. If you hear a lot of clicking noises though when eating this, it is probably your arteries slamming shut :)

I made this for my boyfriend with some smashed red potatoes and he loved it. I followed some of the other suggestions and ended up putting all the bacon on the inside, covering with cheddar cheese rather than swiss - and as my own addition I added a 1/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot sauce to the mix before putting it in the oven, this gave just a hint of that flavor. Followed everything else exactly - rolling it up took a little finese but worked really well in the end of me. I only ate one serving and gave the rest to my boyfriends to have as leftovers, he loved it and I want to make again so I can have more than once serving!

The Man loaf was a huge hit with the men, i personally didn't try it. If they were prepared to eat the leftovers which never happens. You have to know they loved it.

My husband's always begging me to make this at least every 2 weeks. I myself am not a big meatloaf kind of person because most are dry, but this is AMAZING! Even my 2 year old son (picky, picky) loves it. I always add extra cheese and barbecue sauce inside and out of the meatloaf. Fantastic....this meatloaf never gets old in our family. Thanks!

OMG! My family is in love with Man Loaf! I took other reviewers advice and put mozzarella on the top instead of swiss and skipped the bacon over the top and it was FABULOUS! My husband loved it, it is my new fave meatloaf recipe.  You will not be disappointed, just make sure to do your cardio and take your cholesterol meds first!

Yes my first review. I have made this and turned out pretty good
since I have sodium issues I didn't put any salt in it.And add mushrooms. Next time I will put the swiss on last.Icooked it For
about 10 min. after the swiss on and it got hard.

This was a really good recipe!! The only things I changed was I used seasoning salt instead of salt and also sliced swiss as that was what I had on hand. I also put both cheeses inside and on top. To eliminate a crusty cheese on top I put the cheddar on top of the swiss which seemed to help. Also the last 15 minutes I turned the temp up to 450 to crisp the bacon. I used Kraft chipolte BBQ Sauce on top and also put some inside. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

This was a hit with the hubby. I followed the recipe but I didn't roll it. I lined the dish with the bacon thenmy meat mix. BBaked per directions.  Pulled it out add the bbq sauce and some fried onions. Was so good that I had no lftovers which never happends with meatloaf.

Huge meatloaf was devoured immediately. A real hit with the boys! Be ware, it is VERY filling and you may need an alka-seltzer ... but very good.

Couldn't get this to roll right, seemed to have too much filling.  Was a mess and a total disaster.  Ended up making into hamburger patties.  Never again!

My family loves meatloaf and no one liked this.  It felt like a heart attack on a fork.  We do stray from healthy meals for a treat but this was just too much.  I felt like I could hear my arteries hardening.  Will stick to a traditional meatloaf.

I love the idea of this.  We like a bit more spice in our household so zapped it a bit, but it really was alot of fun, both to make and eat. Thanks for sharing.
