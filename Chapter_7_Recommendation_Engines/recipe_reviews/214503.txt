smaller version of the old fashioned pound cake.  to lighten it separate eggs and whip egg whites.  fold into the rest just before putting in pan.  it's a classic, but i still prefer more modern versions.

Not good. Dense and bitter. Followed the recipe, but was disappointed.

Very easy and quick recipe for cake in a pinch.  I added about a tsp of vanilla just for flavor.  It was a bit heavy though, and when I made 2 8in cakes they were quite thin.  Next time I will put the entire batter into a single pan, or double the recipe.

Well, its a cake. Its just very heavy and dense, more like a pound cake than a light fluffy cake for a party. Kinda bland, but the addition of your favorite extract could improve the flavor. Won't be making it again.
