I modified this quite a bit incorporating suggestions of other reviewers.  I first made it during the winter when good tomatoes were hard to find. As modified i likeed both the ease and taste. 

--2 avocado, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks (make sure avocados not too ripe. Stores better and longer if avocado a little green)
--2 medium cans of diced tomatoes and 1 medium can of diced tomatoes with chilis (all very well drained). Omitted chilis, green onions, hot sauce, and roma tomatoes. 
--Zest and juice of one lime 
--Large bunch of cilantro (finely chopped) (fresh cilantro is key to taste)
--1 tablespoon of store bought minced garlic (the fresh garlic was a little raw tasting)
--1 can whole kernel corn (drained; we like the taste of vacuum packed corn best)
--2 cans black beans rinsed and drained
--1/4 cup Red Wine Vinegar
--1/4 olive oil
--salt and pepper to taste.  

Mix all together and store in refrigerator. Makes a great side that goes with so many things--chips, crackers, or just by itself. I've shared this recipe with many people.  We LOVE poor man caviar

As written, this recipe is a bit bland. I improved the flavour by adding lime juice, chopped cilantro, minced garlic and sea salt. Much, much better after those additions.

A very simple and delicious recipe!  I like to use zesty italian dressing instead of oil and vinegar, and I also use diced fresh bell peppers and plain shoepeg corn.

YUM! This was not a particularly pretty dish but it tasted great. I used 3 avocados and after I chop them up I squeeze some lemon or lime juice on the avocado, red onion instead of green onion, and about a 1/3 cup of chopped cilantro. I have tried it with the dressing listed in the recipe and also tried it with Italian dressing and liked the Italian dressing better. Make sure your avocados are firm yet ripe. Don't mix everything until all of the ingredients are in the bowl. The more you stir it the uglier it looks.I have also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and it worked out fine - just drain the tomatoes well. A can of rotell tomatoes adds that extra heat if desired. This one is a keeper. Great with the Frito lay scoops! ADD SOME CILANTRO  - IT MAKES IT EVEN BETTER!!

I thought the flavor was so-so. I think it would have been better if I hadn't used ultra-ripe avacados, they turned to a soupy mush istead of staying in nice cubes.

This is a dish that's so good you want to go back for more, even though you're already full. I served it as a side dish (with Tomatillo Soup, also from this site), so I chopped the pieces bigger. Also, I used fresh corn and red bell pepper instead of canned Mexicorn. This is a new favorite!

I was feeling a little creative and decided to serve this as a "salad" to go with a Mexican dish . It was fantastic. I added one chopped red bell pepper and used frozen corn but everything else was the same.

Very good... followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little lime juice... it's important to give the flavors some time to merge before serving.

Really good and easy!  The kids, ages 14 and 3, wouldn't eat it, but they're super-picky anyway.  I had this at a pool party a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to make it myself.  I didn't change a thing other than adding a dash of salt and pepper.  Served it with tortilla chips.
Thanks for the tasty and nutritious recipe!

This is awesome and whenever I make it I receive so many compliments that it's a little embarrassing how easy it is.  I usually skip the green onions and keep the avocado in larger chunks.  Last time I made, I threw in some oil that I had made with roasted garlic soaking in it and it was excellent.  I've never found mexicorn and always use regular canned corn and it turns out great.  Lately, we've been enjoying it with blue nacho chips.  One of the easiest flavourful & unique recipes I've ever found on this site.  Thanks for the submission!

Very good.  I did not add the oil and it was still great.  Got better after sitting in the fridge overnight.

This stuff rocks my socks off.  If you haven't made it- you need to.  Everyone will love you.  It is a little plain as written, but I always add lots of fresh cilantro and lime.  Also garlic, some chiles if you're feeling wild, and of course salt and pepper.  I always add a little balsamic vinegar to it as well.  So yes, I modify the heck out of it, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because it's that darn good.  I made an enormous tub of this last summer for a family gathering and it was completely gone within ten minutes.  This is the crack cocaine of dips.

Excellent.  I used vine ripened tomatoes instead of plum.  I'm bringing it to a barbeque tomorrow - I know it will be a big hit...I hope I can  stay away from the fridge tonight! Thanks!!!

Made this for a Labor Day family picnic and it was a hit.  When I told someone what I was bringing, they said no one would eat it.  Were they ever wrong.  I had so many compliments, I felt like Martha Stewart.

Delicious!  I've never seen this made with avocado before, but it was a nice addition.  I live in Japan and can't find black beans, so I added garbanzo beans instead.

This is very similar to the Texas Caviar recipes but w/ avocado instead of black eyed peas. I'd take avocado over the peas any day! :)

Fantastic dish!  Fresh and healthy ~ my only suggestion is to add more of everything!  Also, to use fresh peppers and corn verses the canned stuff.  Yummy!

With the additions of lime juice, cilantro, garlic and green tabasco, this was a HIT at the Mexican party I brought it to last night. Looks pretty, tastes great and is EASY. A keeper.

oh my... I could eat the WHOLE BOWL of this stuff!! I made a couple adjustments based on what I like and what I had on hand.  I don't really like tomatoes, but I did add some picante sauce and salsa (finishing off what was at the bottom of the jars. haha).  I also threw in some minced garlic, salt and pepper, and I used a little balsamic vinegar because that's what I had on hand (I used way less than what was called for).  This is SO good and gets better the longer you leave it in the fridge.

Good dip.  It does need a dash of salt and pepper.  I also substitued Rotel for the tomatoes and squeezed the juice of a lime over my diced avocados before adding them to the dip to keep them from browning and to add extra flavor.  I think next time I will use only 1 avocado, half of the vinegar, and no oil.

A refreshing change from regular salsa. I changed it up a little by adding about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, the juice of a lime, and 1/2 t dried red chiles instead of the hot pepper sauce..everyone loved, and there was none left at the end of the evening..a new favorite summertime treat!

Delicious and nutritious! In addition to eating with the chips or pita, this fills warm, soft tortillas quite nicely. Use avocados that are just ripe - not over ripe avocads that are soft and mushy. Also, mix gently. This will prevent your Mexican Caviar from looking very unappetizing. Thanks so much!

This dish was very easy to prepare and it tasted delicious.  I served this at a get together last night and everyone chowed it down.  It makes alot but the entire dish was scraped clean.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Will make again.

Very easy and yummy! Perfect snack for family while waiting for dinner to be ready. Mine turned out a little mushy too, because of the avacados, but it's just like a guac that's kicked up a notch! I would add one more tomato and fresh cilantro next time.

Don't knock it til you try it!  I didn't have high hopes for this recipe because it's not made with my typical favorite ingredients.  I was totally wrong.  It's so good and not what I really expected at all.  Also, my husband normally wouldn't touch a bean dish to save his life - once I coaxed him into trying this, he devoured it.  We'll definitely make this again.  I prepared it exactly as described, minus the mexicorn.  I had to use regular corn because I couldn't find mexicorn.  Still delicious!

I will definitely be keeping this recipe.  It is SO flavorful, and the best part is it is so good for you!  I can't wait to make a big batch of this and reach for it instead of a bowl of chips.  Very good recipe to have in your pocket if you're trying to eat better and not sacrifice the taste.  Awesome!

This was amazeing.  Did add the garlic & the zest and juice of 1 lime.  Only had dry celantro so can only imagine how even greater it would be when useing the fresh.  Used regular canned corn and some chopped fresh red bell pepper.  Our guests left with big smiles, a small togo pack, and the recipe.  Will certainly make again.

This is excellent and quick to fix!!  I added: *Lime juice of 1 lime (also helps the avacado's not to turn brown as leftovers) *Cilantro *Used Olive Oil instead *Left out the hot sauce b/c I wanted it to be more like a guacamole - but would be great either way.

This is great! I was asked twice in one weekend to bring this to two different parties. Everyone loved! I try to make this the day before. I used Italian dressing instead of vinegar & oil & used 1 can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of plum tomatoes, added cilantro, lime juice & garlic. Delish!

This turned out really well- everybody at the party asked for the recipe. It turns out the avocadoes I bought were too hard so I added cilantro instead and served with sesame blue corn chips. Thanks for sharing!

Great mix to put on chips.  I made it and went to cook the rest of the meal.  My guests had gobbled it up before I had more than a taste.  My wife requested a batch of Poor Man's Cavair at our next two cookouts.

Canola oil is relatively tasteless, even mixed with vinegar. Best to make your own vinaigrette with herbs. Bottled dressing is OK..but homemade was what really gave this recipie a 5 star. In addition...a dash of fresh cilantro was amazing!!!

YUMMMMM!  I made this for a cookout and it was a huge hit! I made it with the Itallian dressing also which made it really good.  I added a small amount of red onion, cilantro and squeezed fresh lime to finish it off.  It was gone in no time and everybody wanted the recipe.  Thanks!!

So good! I took this to an outdoor picnic and it sustained the heat and was delicious.  Like some of the others, I used zesty Italian dressing only because I was in a rush.  I'll try it as the recipe calls for next time.

Fantastic! A big hit at the 2 parties I've taken it to so far. This will continue to be a dish I take to parties because it is so easy. Like other reviewers I used a 1/2 c. zesty italian dressing instead of the red wine and canola oil. yummy

I haven't made this yet but know it would taste wonderful, especially with homemade corn tostadas (just deep fried corn tortillas quickly in hot vegetable oil).  Thanks for the yummy sounding recipe!

I would like to make this again, but I'm not sure what happened. It turned a little mushy, and wasn't as crisp and vibrant as I had thought it might be. I think I chopped the avocados a little too  small. This was the first time I've worked with them, so I'm not too confident that I really knew what I was doing. My daughters had to school me in how to cut them up....the avocados I mean. The recipe, as published, will support over a dozen finger smackers....I may cut the recipe in half considering the number of usual guests that I'd be making this for as an option. It was good - but I know it can be better...and that's on me. :)

I made this using olive oil and I added lime juice. Also, used 1 can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes. Have made it several times...delicious!

Poor Man's Caviar Haiku: "3 stars as written. This called out for seasoning. Served in scoop-y chips." I had a bite w/in the one hour of chilling this recipe (prepared as directed) and found it on the vanilla side of flavorful, so I added a chopped garlic clove, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and the juice of 1/2 a lime. I wanted to add cilantro, but figured it's one of those love-it-or-hate-it herbs and was serving this as a cookout side and erred on the side of pleasing everybody. And well, everybody WAS pleased, although those in attendance who know me were disappointed that I didn't make my usual "Texas Cavier" b/c I wanted to try something new w/ black beans instead of b'eyes. What little leftovers there were got tastier as the day went on, but the avocado is better to add just when you are serving so it doesn't turn to brown glop.

We're not a big fan of foods outside our comfort zone, and neither of us had ever as much as seen an avacado before, but I was hoping other people would appreciate this dish, and it seemed easy enough to make....turns out, I enjoyed it, and so did the party-goers. We had fun peeling and pitting the avacodos, and using 3 medium-sized ones, we became fast experts in the preparation of this fruit (use a plastic knife and you can't go wrong). We didn't find the exact size of the mexi-corn can that the recipe called for, so we used 2 smaller cans that added up to an extra couple ounces. If you find the same in your store, I'm sure the extra didn't negatively alter the results. The recipe yielded a considerable dish, and combined with tortillas or pita chips, you've got a great contribution to any party. For the right event (I think this fits best with a summer theme), we'd certainly make this again.
