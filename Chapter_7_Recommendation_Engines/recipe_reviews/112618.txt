I made these last night, and they're already all gone! They were a success, and although I was a little intimidated since it was my first time making a cookie like this one, your recipe was so easy to follow. (And delicious!) Thank you!

I used to make these with my grandmother many years ago.  For fruit filling, she always used drained pineapple tidbits, or crushed pineapple.  it is very important to drain it well, and she would press it to get more of the liquid out.  Tasty, but probably less authentic Czech variation....But my grandmother was the daughter of Czech immigrants, and this was otherwise the same as their handed down recipe.  She just liked the pineapple variation, which just shows that you can use different fruit fillings to your liking.  I love them!

Loved it. I used Raspberry filling instead and it turned out great.

I’m a bit disappointed. The dough didn’t hold together so my filling was all over the pan, and I didn’t think the dough had much flavor. I’m Czech and was probably excepting something closer to a kolache, so that could be why I was disappointed. 

And, I couldn’t find Solo apricot filling but I found a jar of Smucker’s Simply Fruit apricot and it’s fantastic! I will use this on my kolaches going forward.

Always a hit ... keep them small and square and use less filling (~ 1 tsp).

I chose this recipe because of the added powdered sugar  in the dough.  They turned out great!  Use only about a teaspoon of filling for a 3” square.  That was the cookie cutter I used.  Egg wash under one corner before folding will hold the cookies together.  I made them with red raspberry and peach preserves.  Very tasty!

I made these for Easter and dont know if i made them right or not. the recipe did not say anything about the consistency of the dough and mine was quite sticky. i did roll it up in some more flour they did hold their shape and i filled them with apricot and blackberry filling. After baking they had a barely cooked feel to them. but tasted good. Everyone did enjoy them but i dont know if i will make them again.

Very easy to follow and great to adjust recipe right there!  First time making this type of cookie.
