this was a great recipie the only change i made was that instead of mincing all 4 cloves of garlic i minced 2 and sliced 2. i then cut slits in the salmon and put the garlic slices in the slits. to help flavor the intire salmon. then i used the minced cloves on top like the recipie says

Great recipe if you are a garlic and onions lover-which I am.  Consideration for the general public prevented me from rating this 5 star. Heart smart and definitely full of flavor.  Next time I make it I will take it a step further and add crushed red pepper for a little zip.  Thanks for sharing:)

Instead of tarragon, I used Herbes de Provence.  I've never used that blend of herbs before and all I can say is WOW.  It's a bit pricey, but the flavor these herbs bring to the dish is outstanding.  My salmon turned out more like mustard-crusted, but it was delicious.  Such an easy recipe with fabulous taste.

Another good option for cooking Salmon. I made a "Dijonaise" of light mayo and Dijon with a bunch of chopped garlic. Other than that...used the individual spices suggested by others rather than seasoning salt. A splash of white wine didn't hurt the moisture aspect any and adds to a mayo/dijon/garlic/wine sauce, albeit not of a large volume.

This was ok.  I didn't like the flavors of dijon mustard and salmon together.  It wasn't terrible though.  I sauteed the onions first, which added to the flavor, in a good way.  Served with whole wheat couscous and steamed broccoli.

My husband loves salmon.  He said this was better than any he has had in a restaurant.  And it's really simple. I left out the onion but it was great.

Love this combination but then again we love garlic and onions.   Would probably saute onions a little first tho - anyway, it is a great recipe and healthy too!!!  Thanks for submitting

This was terrific.  I made a few changes.  I cooked in a skillet with some olive oil the onion and garlic and added some portobello and button mushrooms then added them on top of the salmon per the recipe instructions.  It was wonderful.  I made the same thing with chicken for my husband since he doesn't like salmon and he liked his too.

This was good, but the recipe calls for way to much mustard.  We will make it again, but we will cut the mustard down to about a third of what this recipe calls for.  We couldn't taste the salmon with all the mustard.

Fantastic recipe!  I would never have tried it because the ingredients seemed so unusual, but the ratings convinced me to give it a go.  Glad I did.  I used herbes de province instead of tarragon.  I followed the directions to lightly coat the fish with the dijon mustard, so only used about half the amount mentioned in the recipe.  I think it was key to cut the onion very finely, as described in the recipe, that way the garlic and onions makes a fine layer over the fish and cooks adequately.  Delicious!

Hold the Dijon! 
I wanted to give a new flavor to the salmon I had ready to cook and thought this looked amazing. I didn't have tarragon or onions, so I just put Dijon garlic and a little Cajun seasoning for some heat. I was overwhelmed by the dijon but I think it will be better next time with some changes for my taste. I will use less Dijon, cook the onion and garlic first and skip my Cajun idea

Loved this easy recipe. Only changes I made were to use fresh tarragon from the garden (about 3T., finely chopped for 6 salmon fillets) and a Vidalia onion instead of red because that's what I had on hand. Made this for company and they really enjoyed it.

I'd give it 6 stars if I could!  Very easy and makes no mess to prepare! Great week-night meal. Very diet-friendly too!  Only change I'd make- chop the onions a bit instead of rings to get the added flavor in each bite!

I didn't like this that well. The amount of mustard overpowered the delicate taste of the salmon. I think if maybe a quarter of the mustard were used, along with some white wine and honey, this would be a pretty good dish. As is, it's not very enjoyable. 
Thanks anyway.

Perfect!  Used a shallot in place of red onion (only because that's all I had on-hand).  Very nice dish!

Super fast and easy, and very, very good!  I substituted onion powder for slices of onion.  Served to guests who also loved it.

I mostly tasted the garlic and onion… a bit too much.  I offset the taste by adding a light layer of my homemade tartar sauce.  I like a reviewers suggestion of using "Dijonaise" (a marriage between Dijon and Mayo ;).  Also, the cooking time was a bit too much so be careful with that.

This is my new go to salmon recipe. the first time i made it, i felt that the onions were undercooked. i remedied this the next time by prebaking the onions and garlic for 10 minutes before adding it to the top of the fish.

i used smaller fillets ( about 3 oz) so i halved the baking time, and i didn"t have any tarragon so i put a little parmesean cheese over top of the mustard, garlic, onion etc. served with sauteed spinach over brown rice. it was awesome! super moist and yummy. this has definitely become my go-to salmon recipe!

That mustard and tarragon combo is heavenly! Definitely the right spice for this! I added 1 Tbsp of honey to the Dijon to provide more balance to the harshness of this kind of mustard. Delicious! Not too sweet. I chopped my garlic and placed it on top of the fish like a crust. Worked out great. My onions turned out perfect. I think the key is slicing them paper thin. I also sprinkled the whole thing with olive oil before popping it in the oven. I think that helped cook the onions better. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I love salmon with Dijon, but if you don't like the heavy flavor of the Dijon I always add a splash of honey to the mustard to take away some of the heavy mustard flavor.  I like the idea of making slits in the salmon and putting in a piece of garlic. Too much garlic can be a bit much so just adjust to your taste and the size of the salmon.

Huge hit with the whole family! I have a really hard time getting my boys (12 and 7 year old twins) to eat fish. They asked for seconds with this dish. Will be adding this to our dinner rotation.

My husband and I thought this was great!  I love garlic and onion so this was perfect for me.  I used a Vidalia onion since that was all I had on hand & it was delicious.  I may grill the onion slightly next time like some other reviewers did just to make sure it cooks through on the fish.  The salmon was nice and moist.  Really enjoyed it and will make it again!

The onion and garlic were much too strong when simply sliced and placed on top of the mustard.  I would try sauteing them or leave them off completely, although I'm not sure I'll try this recipe again.  Much better ways to cook salmon out there!

I was a little leary of the Dijon on salmon but this recipe was delicious.  It was very quick and easy to make.  It smelled nice only 1 minute after going in the oven.  The flavors combined nicely but were not overwhelming or strong.  My husband and 2 year old son ate alot of it and my son is a picky eater usually.  I'd so recommend this recipe to anyone who loves fish.

Great flavors from a simple, quick, healthy dish. If I make it again I will use shallots instead of a red onion.

The cuts of salmon I had were thick, so I had to bake for several minutes longer than noted here for it to cook all the way through.

Tried this recipe with a few tweeks.  Used lime juice instead of lemon and sprinkled filets with Tajin a Mexican chili lime seasoning.  Wrapped in the foil with garlic and dill cooked for 25 min at 450.  The salmon came out so juicy and flavorful.  A very simple recipe that I will try many more times.  My daughter tried it as the recipe states  and loved it also

Very healthy and delish! I rubbed olive oil over both sides. Then I minced the onions and garlic and added 1T of honey plus crushed red pepper to the mustard. Spread it all over the top and sprinkles tarragon S&P over the top. Cooked it on the grill. Yum! Goes great with a Caesar salad. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was okay...the fish overpowered the dijon so I had a dipping cup of dijon on the side. Definitely pre-sweat onions, oven time didn't cook them enough. Thought I added a lot of garlic but it just didn't come through. Don't know if I'll be trying this again.

This was tasty and my husband made it gourmet by prettily arranging the toppings ;) We didn't measure out the mustard-just made sure to lightly coat-he brushed it on with a basting brush. Also, we used a smaller casserole dish and cooked for about 11 minutes (20 is WAY too long!)

Very nice dish ! However I found the onions not cooked enough so I marbled them the next time before layering on top and this did the trick.

Thanks for this quick and tasty recipe! I didn't want to heat up the house thus: used 2 pans, sauteed the onions & garlic together with salt & pepper in one, seared the skin side of the salmon (with flesh side coated in mustard/salt/pepper) in another oven proof one.  Broiled the salmon to finish, topped with fresh tarragon from my garden.  Wow,now that was good!  Once again, thanks for this easy and yummy recipe :)

I was scared to use the amount of dijon mustard that the recipe originally called for.  I used just enough mustard to coat the fish and the flavor combination of the mustard, onions, garlic and spices were subtle and very good.  Maybe using the full amount of mustard will give it a better taste but it wasn't necessary for me.  I will definitely prepare this dish again.  Thank you FresnoCook!

Was not real impressed with this one.  Too much dijon mustard.  I think it took away from the flavor of the fish.

I love the simplicity of this recipe but after reading the reviews I decided to cut the mustard in half. It was still way too much. Next time I make it I will go with 1/3 to 1/2 of the onion and garlic and only very lightly brush on the mustard - probably using a 1/4 of what it class for. It has potential but definitely needs to be toned down so you can actually taste the salmon.

I cut the recipe to two servings, I marinated the salmon with the Dijon, garlic, S&P and fresh tarragon for about twenty minutes while it rested out of the fridge. I topped it with the thin sliced red onion before baking. The flavor was mild but good. I'll probably do this again because I normally have all the ingredients. Thank you for sharing a lovely dish.

It was ok, I didn't taste the garlic. Seemed to me that it covered up the delicate taste of the Salmon.  Glad I tried it, but will try something else.

Very good, simple recipe; easy to prepare. Substituted minced dry onion, as I am not a big fan of sliced onions, but bravo! Thanks, this has inspired a few other ideas utilizing Dijon mustard, which we love.

This is a tasty and simple recipe. But, cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillets. 20 minutes would have been too long for ours. Also recommend mixing spices with dijon before spreading it on.

Delicious and so easy. The salmon is cooked perfectly. I did not have tarragon so used a 5-Spice mix. Suitable for a dinner party

My husband makes a mean salmon filet, but I convinced him to let me try this one.  He gave it a 9.5. I didn’t change any of the ingredients.  However, we like our salmon rare so we cooked it 12 minutes and it was perfect!

This recipe was bland and did zero favors for the fish.  It’s easy enough to make, but in my opinion there need to be major adjustments to the recipe.

This is yummmmmy!  Made it as instructed.  I am making again for the 2nd time next week.  The only thing I will do different is to add more garlic & red onion and perhaps cook  for only 10-15 minutes!!  (if you like rare salmon)   Enjoy ... it is very good!!

This recipe was wonderful . Very easy and my husband gave it two thumbs up. I am always pleased with a recipe that gets rave reviews from my husband. I did however, because I am not a fan of Dijon mustard, use a Carolina style barbeque sauce to glaze my piece of salmon and it was off the hook. I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone that likes salmon and is looking for a way to spice up their normal salmon dinner choices.

No changes. I found the garlic and onions weren't cooked enough. Next time I will saute them to soften and then maybe cover with foil.  Otherwise the taste was great.

Wow!!!! Fantastic! I would have never thought to put Dijon mustard on salmon. Besides being super easy and delicious, 2 hours later and my house does not have a fish smell. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and very, very simple.  Nice variation on just a straight up barbecuing or broiling.  This is an excellent last-minute go-to for dinner.

So simple but delicious!  I had trouble with broiling the salmon as it got too brown before cooking completely.  Will likely bake it next time, but there will be a next time!  My husband who doesn't care for fish really like it!!

It was okay. Instead of Dijon though I used spicy yellow mustard because I find Dijon to be slightly bitter. Also replaced the tarragon with dried dill. Overall, I prefer salmon to be pan seared. Seems it locks in more taste than baking the fish.

I have trouble cooking fish, but this was easy and tasty. I was worried that the mustard would be too much, but it was perfect. I cooked it in an aluminum foil boat so that I could have the mustard and my friend could be without, he hates mustard. Easy peasy, I'll make this again.

Excellent and delicate blend of flavors. Didn’t have a red onion so I used chopped yellow onion and I didn’t have garlic bulb so used jarred chopped garlic.

We love salmon. I was a bit hesitant about using Dijon mustard,, but the dish was delicious. The red onion was sweet after cooking and garlic makes everything better.

Made this tonight for a little  change the traditional way I fix Salmon.  My husband and I both liked it a lot.  The only change I made was not adding the onion.  I would fix this again for sure.

I found the dijon was too strong a flavor to really complement the salmon well, and it also overpowered the garlic which I then couldn't taste. I might use the cooking method again but not these toppings/seasonings.

Super impressed with the flavor of the mustard and salmon. I didn't have tarragon so added a little honey to the mustard. So delicious. Will make again, for sure.

Delicious! Made it as directed except I mixed all the spices with the Dijon and used minced fresh garlic and minced dried onion instead of the slices. Will definitely be making this low cost dish pretty regular. I am trying to start meal prepping healthy dishes that are also low carb...and this fits the bill.

Less cooking time, in my oven, anyway. Less garlic, more dijon and I used dill and parsley, not tarragon.  The onions were amazing!  Crispy and flavorful!

This was a hit in my house.  I followed the recipe and my husband, teenage son and I gobbled it up. Only thing I will change is I plan to dice the onions instead of slice them next time to ensure each bite has a little bit of that crunch the onion gives.

Not my favorite. Too much mustard for my taste. Over powered the flavor of the salmon.

This was great!  I followed other reviewers and made a few changes.  I coated the salmon with a layer of dijon and then sprinkled on Italian seasoning.  I then sauteed some mushrooms, yellow onions, and garlic.  Topped the salmon with that mix and popped it in the oven for 10 minutes.  Served over rice, it was amazing!

Absolutely delicious and so full of flavor.  I love dijon, so I used a little more than the recipe called for.  I also used shallots instead of the red onion, since I was only making 2 fillets.  And as someone else suggested, I substituted oregano for the tarragon.  Served over a bed of couscous or rice for a wonderful meal.

Very Good. My son and I both enjoyed this recipe. I did not realize I was out of tarragon when I started to make this so had to leave that out. Tasted great w/o it any way. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was a very good recipe but that it needed some 'tweating".  I minced the garlic and onion as I did not want to bite in the slices.  I then added lemon slices on top of the other ingredients.  Just plain yummy!  Pat

I don't know.  I really expected to like this one.  I like garlic.  I like onions, I like salmon, I like dijon.  But I don't know if I have had tarragon before.  I know I have never made anything with it, so maybe that was it.  The first bite or two wasnt so bad but then I got a taste of something not so hot.  Tarragon maybe?  Slice of garlic?  I am more use to minced or garlic salt/powder.  So I don't know.  I might try it again with honey dijon, minced garlic, and no tarragon?  I was really hoping to like this one but it looks like many people do so it must just be my taste buds.

I don't like fish, but I know that I have to eat it sometimes just for the health benefits.  This was a great recipe.  I used spicy brown mustard since I didn't have any dijon and both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I'll be making it again.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe and a change from my normal salmon dinners.  It tasted and looked like a dish from a fancy restaurant and my hubby loved it.  I served it with couscous and a salad.   Will definitely make again.

Very good!  my hubbys favorite slamon recipe yet.  I just don't understand why the recipe calls for 1/3 cup of mustard when "lightly coating"  the salmon on requires a few tablespoons.

Very easy to do. We did slight variation. I used scallions instead of red onions and we cooked it on the gas grill on reynolds wrap...my family loved and said it was " a keeper". I served it with your Old Fashioned Potatoe Salad and corn on the cob...a real hit.

I like it, but didn't love it.  The flavors were a little too strong for me.  That may have been because I scaled the recipe back to 1 portion only (my husband doesn't like fish), and I think it's difficult to keep the seasoning ratios intact-- so that may have been the problem.
