This is my recipe, and I just had to comment. I usually use homemade beef broth instead of canned, and also use Dijon mustard. I often double the recipe, and freeze leftovers for future meals. It can be frozen with or without the cooked noodles - without takes less freezer space, but both ways work equally well. Whether or not the red pepper is used or if the quantity is reduced is a personal taste. Sometimes I use red pepper flakes, and sometimes, I don't. I have also cut the meat the night before and let it marinade in the wine overnight. This works well, to and tenderizes the meat more. If you use a less tender cut of meat, this works well. For a more tender cut of meat, overnight marinade is a bit of an overkill.

I have tried almost every stroganoff recipe on this site, and this one is the best by far. Like james747 , I used fresh mushrooms and also marinated my beef in the red wine for about two hours prior to cooking. The end result was incredible. This is definitely going into the family recipe book. Thank you for an exceptional recipe!

Why only 1 review? This recipe is amazingly delish! Followed the recipe as written except I substituted fresh mushrooms instead of canned, used Dijon mustard, used a 14 oz can of beef broth so I omitted the water and used olive oil with a tab of butter cut in. I simmered for about one hour and 20 minutes. The meat came out very tender. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was my first attempt and it was so spicy we were practically breathing fire! LOL! Even my husband said how spicy it was and he can handle a lot of heat in his food. I adjusted the servings to 8, used crushed red pepper, assuming it's the same as red pepper flakes, and kept everything else the same. I will definitely try it againP.S. I hated to only give it one star because I'm sure I messed up somewhere, but it wouldn't let me post if I didn't rate it.

I made this tonight for the first time for dinner for my husband and 13 year old.  It is a little labor intensive and does take nearly two hours, but it is well worth it.  I always read the reviews of recipes on here prior to making them and I am glad I did follow several other reviewers' suggestions to halve the red pepper flakes.  I put in just a teaspoon and it still had plenty of kick.  Next time I will use just a half as my teenager doesn't care for that much spice.  I did marinate the meat in pinot noir for 30 minutes.  Next time I will do at least two hours if not four just to further enhance the flavors.  Honestly, it was 5 stars with just 30 minutes so if that is all the time you have, it still comes out delicious.  Additionally, I will probably simmer it for more than an hour to thicken the sauce or add just a pinch of corn starch at the end as I prefer more of a gravy consistency.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper and can be tweaked for everyone's liking.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted 1 small container of plain Greek yogurt for the cream cheese and sour cream.  I really liked this recipe except I wasn't crazy about the red pepper. Was a little too spicy for us.  Would leave that out next time.

Great recipe!  Used fresh mushrooms, but will cut back a little on paprika next time - my wife doesn't really care for paprika - don't know why, I love it!  Meat was a little tough, but tasted great - may try chuck next time.  Was using Julia Child's recipe till now....   .... sorry Julia!

I made this for dinner last night...oh my goodness my 13 year old son who eats NOTHING....had two helpings. As others did, I used fresh mushrooms and the only thing I am changing for next time is cutting the red pepper flakes in half. It had just a little too much bite! Otherwise loved it! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Excellent.  I used 2 lbs. of stew meat, as that is what was on hand.  I keep small, 4 pack bottles of red and white wine, on hand, just for these types of recipes.  Just a quick shake of the red pepper flakes, per reviews.  Just a really good tasting dish. Thanks for sharing.

Simply the best we have ever had.  I eased off of the red pepper flakes a little bit, and didn't cook as long because it was already super tender.  Don't skip the red wine. It is what makes it. Amazing!  Thanks!

My go to recipe! Use fresh mushrooms with Dijon mustard and have even made it in a pressure cooker with great success. I have converted non stroganoff lovers with this recipe. Itâ€™s hard to screw up this recipe as long as the beef is marinated and cooked long enough. Amazing!

Very good recipe! Thank you!  I pretty much followed it except I used fresh mushrooms and added them to the beef and  onions before adding the broth.

This one goes in my family favorites cookbook! Family loved it.  I did leave out the red pepper flakes so it wasn't so hot.  The sauce was absolutely delicious, best I've ever had with stroganoff!  I think the cream cheese was the secret.

Great recipe, but I would omit/cut down the red pepper unless you really like things spicy.

Excellent recipe. I will be making this again. Fresh mushrooms are preferable, but canned work in a pinch. Next time I would leave out the creamed cheese. It made the sauce too thick for my taste.

This recipe is delicious and wows company. I make this at least once a month and itâ€™s a hit every time. I omit the red peppers because I have little ones with a finicky palate-but they both eat it ravenously. I follow the recipe except for I use all sour cream instead of the cream cheese. Itâ€™s a staple in my recipes-my mom would be so proud! Thank you for adding such a timeless recipe!

We enjoyed this very much. A little different than other stroganoff recipes I have made. The pepper flakes give it a nice bite, and the wine tenderized the meat very nicely.  Love the mixture of cream cheese with the sour cream - gave the dish a nice texture.

wonderful recipe. the top sirloin probably isn't the best quality of meat to pick, but it was cheap and it still came out tender. the restaurant I work for uses filet mignon and Dijon mustard instead, which is incredible over there. thanks for the recipe, I will use this one again.

Excellent.  We enjoyed this recipe very much.  Not too sour like some recipes that use way too much sour cream.  Cut way back on red pepper flakes...else made it as described.

Huge success! I added more wine to fully cover and marinated the meat and minced garlic and salt and pepper. I had sit in the fridge for about 3 hours. At first was worried about how much fluids were boiling the meat but I kept cool and it turned out to be just enough as it reduced. Very yummy!

This is a definite keeper. My family loved this recipe.  I used Steak loin tails and marinated in the red wine for about 4 hours.  So tender and delicious.  Like others I used fresh mushrooms and halved the red pepper flakes.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Based on other comments I only added a small amount of red pepper flakes and cooked the meat longer to make it more tender.  I would definitely use a more tender cut of meat if I made it again.  The dish is very tasty and I would make it again using the adjustments suggested.

Followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT the 2 tsp of crushed red pepper. I used 1 tsp and still found it to spicy so Iâ€™ll leave that out next time. Other than that it was a perfect recipe and Iâ€™ll be making this again!

Awesome recipe. The beef was melt in your mouth tender.  Elegant Beef Stroganoff has been added to my regularly used recipes. As per my usual, I left out the red pepper.

This is good - the only change I made is to add some paprika (other recipes call for this). And I don't think I used as much butter as it calls for... and didn't cook everything in totally separate batches like it says.

I saw there was noticeable sauce reduction, after simmering ingredients for 40 minutes; adding a touch of water, beef stock and Worcestershire sauce seemed to help. The red wine marinade pretty much cooked out during simmering--but was infused IN the meat just enough.  You might need to adjust ( add ) amounts of beef stock / red wine to your tastes.  Yet another great recipe that's a keeper in my personal printed recipe collection.

Very good recipe however I did make a couple changes. We have elk meat which we get each hunting season, so that is what I used. I also did not have drinking wine on hand so used Oriental Rice Wine for the marinade, and that worked well also. I can not tolerate much spice so used only paprika and pepper for the spice.  The taste of the meat and sauce was wonderful. I did use fresh mushrooms too. I recommend this for the family or for company.

Was not a fan.  After reading other re views I cut down the chili flakes to one tsp. and still found it overpowering.   Honestly this was my first attempt at stroganoff, my husband's criticism was that it wasn't "creamy" enough.  Will have to keep searching for one that contains more dairy.

Excellent recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and it was wonderful.  Next time I'll use half the red pepper though.  I've never made stroganoff using cream cheese but I will from now on.  The entire family loved it.

This was wonderful.  I know one should follow the recipe exactly the first time, but I really don't care for canned mushrooms so I used fresh and added them in with the onions.  This is my new go to Stroganoff recipe.

Love the taste, but I used half the red pepper. This is the true stroganoff, long prep recipe, but worth it. No short cuts to this recipe. I suggest serving with garlic bread and side salad.

I made this, following the recipe. It was very good, however a little too spicy with the 2 tsp of red pepper flakes. When I make it again, I plan to adjust down the quantity of red pepper flakes. Otherwise, very easy to make and a nice presentation.

I did like this recipe.  I've been making beef stroganoff for decades with my mom's recipe, but I thought I'd try something new for a change.  I liked all the flavors here, and I even liked the addition of cream cheese, which I thought I wouldn't.  I admit, though, that I miss my mom's clove and nutmeg scented version better.   I might keep the cream cheese, though,  because I liked the consistency of the sauce.  This is a good recipe; it's just a matter of nostalgia and what I learned to eat and cook as a child.

Waaaaay too spicy.  I might make it again, but with 1/2 t. red pepper flakes.  I used crushed red pepper (Pepperscale.com says they are the same thing, maybe they are wrong?)  I don't know how people gave it such good ratings.  I literally was picking red pepper out and rinsing the beef so I didn't have to throw it all away.

I really, really liked this recipe.  It was super creamy and I didn't use any salt or pepper when I ate it.  (I pepper almost everything)

I omitted the red pepper flakes as my wife doesn't really like food too spicy.  I ,personally, would let the beef marinate in the red wine for a good hour.  It helps to break down the meat making it much more tender.

Also, don't shortchange the stewing of this - do it for the full hour or more!.  Stroganoff meat should be very tender.

My Husband was so skeptical when I showed him this recipe but WOW did he ever love it! I made it last weekend and he is still talking about it and wants it again ...now! Only change was to use 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. May double batch next time and freeze some

I've been making this as part of my regular rotation of favorite recipes for about a year. My boyfriend loves it! I use top sirloin, fresh baby Bella mushrooms, and less red pepper flakes. If you use the amount of red pepper flakes the recipe calls for it is super spicy and overpowering. I just kinda sprinkle a little on top. Otherwise I wouldn't change anything.

I'm used to using my crockpot or pressure cooker for stroganoff. I was very pleased with the tenderness of the beef using the stove top. I followed the recipe exactly and I might add a tiny bit more garlic only because we really LOVE garlic. Great recipe!

Per the recipe, it came out a little spicy, and this is a Mexican family that eats chilies talking.  If you reduce the spice, this was a great dish.  Also, we left out the wine and added beef broth instead.  I would definitely eat it again.

I would say if you're not a huge spicy person, probably half the red pepper amount or don't include at all. Otherwise, it's a really great recipe. Also, used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard and it was good!

This recipe is fantastic as is. The second time I made it I made a few method changes that are more my preference and less about the recipe. I seared the beef separately over very high heat to make sure it would come out tender, then set it aside and lowered the temp to saute the onions, mushrooms, and garlic. I did take some suggestions from the ratings and use all beef broth and fresh mushrooms. I also left out the cream cheese out of personal preference.  This is going to be a regular dinner in my house.

Really tasty...:)  I added a touch more red wine and Worcestershire, and used additional beef broth instead of water.  Also used fresh mushrooms that I cooked with the beef and onions just a bit before adding the liquid.  I may add a touch more mustard next time, but I will definitely make this again!

Overall this recipe was alright. I had to add a little flour for the sauce to thicken a little bit, had I not it would've been very watery. I used sliced fresh baby Bella mushrooms instead of canned. If I make this again I will omit the garlic. Either I'm pregnant or the garlic was just too much and I'm positive it's the latter of the two. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this because I did, as did my 6 year old. I was just expecting it to turn out better.

Wonderful flavor! I used all sour cream instead of cream cheese, but still turned our great. Used a cab for the wine, which I think attributed to the flavor. Defiantly a wonderful recipe!

I like heat but the pepper beat out the other flavors and it was awfully thin. Will give it another shot with half the pepper and skipping the water.

Did not like at all.  Way too spicy, even after reducing the pepper flakes to half and paprika to half.  And I normally like spicy dishes.  This just didn't taste like stroganoff to me.

I really liked this recipe. It does take some time but it is worth the wait. Taste the meat before you add the sour cream and cream cheese for tenderness. It may need a little more time simmering. My husband did think the spice from the red pepper was a little too much. I would take it down a tiny bit for him but I would still keep it in.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was AMAZING!! All the kids, husband and I loved it. The best Strogie I've ever had! The teen didn't care for it but she's weird, we love it and will be making it often! The only thing I did differently was used fresh portabello mushrooms instead of canned and sauteed them with the onions, garlic and meat.

Delicious and really very easy. One point of criticism for the recipe as written is the amount of red pepper flakes.  I cut it back to 1.5 tsp instead of 2 tsp and still felt it was just a little more than I care for.  I think too that's this recipe benefits from simmering for a couple of hours instead of just one.  The meat continues to tenderize in that second hour, so don't rush it.

I love this recipe. I try to marinate the beef for at least two hours first and I always use fresh mushrooms. A mix of portobello and crimini is delicious!

This was positively FABULOUS!  Only reduced the red pepper flakes and added a touch more wine and thickened up with Wondra flour at the end.   If there was a higher rating, I'd be giving it!  That good!

Excellent recipe- this was my best-ever stroganoff! Like anyone, I made a few tweaks: I used pre-cut beef stew meat. I marinated the beef in about 1/2 a bottle of red wine for 2 hours. I sautÃ©ed an onion with a pound of mushrooms first, then removed them from the pan and browned the meat. Since I had so much marinade left over, I cut the water completely. Finally, I let it simmer for about 90 minutes, with the last 20 or so with 8 oz of cream cheese stirred in. So yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good. Based on other reviews, glad I didn't add the paprika or red pepper and used fresh mushrooms, Dijon mustard. I followed the rest of the recipe and would make it the same way.

Four stars because 2 tsp of red pepper as written was inedible for our family. I should've read the reviews before cooking! My bad. Made again, added 1/4tsp instead and it was delicious!

When was all said and done, it tasted great. However, the cream cheese took 2 hours to melt on simmer, I even cut it into small pieces. A much later dinner than planned. I suggest that anyone making this meal use a bowl with a mixer to cream the cream cheese, sour cream, and some of the broth before adding it to the mixture.

Unbelievably decadent, even when using organic light sour cream and fat-free cream cheese. I also used gluten-free all purpose flour on the meat and it came out beautifully. I omitted the red pepper flakes as using the paprika was more than sufficient. Used leftover London Broil which made this dish over the top. Rave reviews all across the board! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an absolutely delightful meal! Although I do like hot & spicy, I found the 2tsp red pepper flakes to be a little TOO much of a kick and ended up using 1tsp instead. Wonderful recipe and it's already in the family recipe book!

Way too spicy even after halving the red pepper. I recommend only a dash or 1/4ing at most.  Otherwise, all the other flavors and textures are on point.  Maybe like it a touch creamier, so consider increasing those creamy ingredients at the end.

I made the Elegant Beef Stroganoff just to try it out- FIVE STARS isn't enough - this recipe should be 100 stars. The only thing I changed was to cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. It still had a nice bite! I wasn't planning on making it the second time so soon but, when my daughter was visiting I told her about it - and, she REALLY wanted to try it. She loved it,too!! Can't wait to make it again - an excellent recipe that can also be made ahead for a special dinner. KUDO'S to Judy2304 for sharing a delicious recipe!! Nella

Made this tonight. Delicious! I will definitely make again. The only change I will make is decreasing the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon.  I used 1 teaspoon and it was too spicy. A keeper recipe!  I did marinate the steak for 2 hours also.

Made it twice for winter dinner parties and it was a huge success. I also marinated the steak.  I let is marinate for four hours in the fridge. Exceptional!  I used fresh mushrooms as well and followed the recipe directly from then on.

Wow!  This was FABULOUS!  I followed the recipe except I used 1 tsp of red pepper instead of 2, and it was perfect.  Also, I simmered it in a dutch oven for 5 hours, and the meat was so tender, so delicious.  I think this is my new favorite meal.  Heaven in my mouth.  My husband almost made himself sick because he couldn't stop eating it.  This is going to be a staple at our place, and this is something I would be proud to serve for company.  Definitely try this - you won't regret it!

I used balsamic vinegar to marinate it and cut the red pepper flakes in half - I'm not a fan of really spicy stuff so next time will omit it. Will definitely make this again - very yummy!

I made this for a birthday supper tonight for my friends.  Everyone loved it, and there were NO leftovers.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, although I slipped down and inadvertently used 2 teaspoons of mustard, instead of one.  I think next time I will try the Dijon mustard, or spicy brown mustard, otherwise, no changes.  It was great.

I have another beef stroganoff recipe that I have used for years, and I like this one just as well.  We didn't find it to be too spicy as others reported...the cream cheese and sour cream tend to mellow it out.  But there was a subtle spiciness which was nice.  Marinated the beef for approx. 1 hour in the wine before browning.  Very good.

First let me say, if i was big on spices this would be that dish. Before making the dish i read a lot of comments, which stated the level of spiciness of this dish. So i made alterations to it. So...this reading is from what i made. Instead of the full measure ments of the pepper flakes and the paprika, i cut it to half the measurement. I substituted two cans of cream of mushroom soup for the can of mushrooms and the broth, i added a can of water instead of the amount suggested, i used honey mustard, garlic powder (that is what was available in my cabinet).
Over all the main ingredients i kept the same. So i thank you Judy2304  for the recipe.

I added 2/3 c of country gravy mix to c beef stock then used that to thicken it. I also removed the water and used ground chuck instead of the beef. I added fresh red peppers and mushrooms.

AWESOME recipe. I followed the recipe almost to the letter-- I omitted the red pepper. The meat was tender and the flavor was amazing-- my husband was standing with his bowl in hand before it even finished cooking. This is definitely going to be a regular on the menu at my house.

I used the fresh shrooms and let the meat soak in a while bottle of red wine for almost 2 hours.

Awesome recipe, I only changed one thing, I added a bit more whole grain horseradish mustard to give the sauce a little more kick...It was out of this world!!!
