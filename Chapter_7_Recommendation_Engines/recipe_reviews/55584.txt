5 stars for being and easy and tasty recipe! I used boneless, skinless breasts. I added bits of orange peel to the marinade for added flavor.  If you use dried rosemary make sure you strain the marinade before basting or you will have chewy leaves.  I boiled the remaining marinade, added a splash of gran mariner and thickened with a teaspoon of cornstarch in a bit of water.  Pour over chicken breasts when you serve. Yum!

WONDERFUL recipie!!!

I changed it just a tad, instead of letting it marinate, low on time, I added the mixture to a pan and threw the chicken in.  If you use a good pan (hubby's a chef lol) and throw a top on it the spices will cook into the meat and it's perfect.  From there we strained the rosemary and chives and made a rioux to add to the juices.  This thickened it perfectly and it went BEAUTIFULLY over rice.

Overall, dinner was fantastic tonight.

This recipe was wonderful and wonderfully easy. My husband loved it.  He said he had never tasted chicken so tender.  I used eight boneless chicken breasts.  I sliced a breast to take to work the next day.  It was not overcooked when I heated it in the microwave.  I have passed this recipe on to coworkers with my recommendations.  Kudows to DEERPANT.

This was a repeater.  Most of the ingredients are staples - ok, ok, so I had to substitute green onions for the chives but it turned out just fine.  When making it, highlight the marinate 4 hours so you can have it on the night you planned to have it.  I am not a broiler so it went on the grill and worked just fine.

Very flavorful!  I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings and used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  The fresh herbs really make this taste great.  I will be using this to top a summer salad or to make chicken salad lettuce wraps!

Very good for an adult taste. My daughter didn't like it at all. I can see why.My chicken came out kind of dry, though. If anybody has advice on how to keep my chicken from getting dry, please let me know!

Add the zest of an orange, and the flavor really perks up. Marinate overnight.  Make the sauce as recommended by several reviewers. To the cook who asked how to keep the chicken from getting dry: Once it's marinated overnight, don't overcook it! The marinade should keep it moist.

Excellent marinade for grilled chicken.  The orange and rosemary are very strong so if you're not a fun of the fresh herb or citrus chicken this one might not be for you.  I used inexpensive chicken thighs and added a little extra rosemary for my clan of chicken eaters and they gobbled it up!

I think the idea sounds better than the taste.  Too much rosmary, too much orange, and we didn't even use the sauce.

4.5, but I'm rounding up. We did this recipe on the grill, used less oil, used all dried herbs (and in lower amounts, the dried:fresh ratio is 1:3), and used BLSL chicken breast halves (5 of them for this recipe). Cooking anything on the grill (if you're any good at grilling) automatically makes everything taste a lot better, so my rating might not be entirely fair, but as far as the flavor combination goes, there's nothing wrong here. The boiled marinade made a fantastic sauce to go over brown rice, and I grilled marinated asparagus to go with this. (1 lb asparagus, 1 tb olive oil, 1 tb orange juice, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tablespoon dried rosemary, marinated 2 hours and grilled in a veggie basket). Give it a shot if you like these flavors -- but don't broil it, just bake or grill it. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I marinated this over night and grilled on the counter top grill. It was fabulous.  The longer it sits the better.

With a few *minor* tweaks, this is an amazing and easy recipe.  First off, I cooked mine in my counter top convection oven...it came out very juicy and tender.  As far as the 'tweaks' go, add 2 to 3 spoonfuls of frozen orange juice concentrate and the grated rind of one orange to the marinade.  (Or just make orange juice from concentrate with HALF the water it calls for).  You can use green onions in place of the chives.  After you are finished with the marinade, strain it, add some water to dilute a bit (a cup or so) AND BOIL IT TO MAKE IT SAFE TO EAT!  Add chicken bouillon granules and if needed, a bit more water until the taste and amount is to your liking, then thicken with cornstarch.  I made this with boneless, skinless breasts exactly according to my tweaks, and served it with Basmati rice (our favorite) and a green salad.  This turned out to be a very good and simple-to-make dinner that my whole family loved.  Will definitely pass this one on!

This was great. Marinated for 3 and 1/2 hrs. and it had plenty of flavor. Used some grated peel too.
Served with Jasmine rice and green salad.
I would not cook in the broiler in summer again but it was fun to try and did cook 4 full breasts of chicken in 30 minutes even. I lined the baking pan and sprayed with olive oil. In the future I would try grilling or even baking this as the olive oil did a lot of splattering and sparking in the broiler (and I had it 8 inches from the heat).
Really tasty, stayed moist! Good recipe:)

Great easy chicken recipe.  The flavor of orange and rosemary makes it very interesting.  I used chicken breasts and it worked just fine, reduce the cooking time a bit.  This is a keeper.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have enough fresh rosemary, so I used some fresh and some dried. I would make this again.

I hate people that do this but here I go. I totally changed the recipe! I didn't have orange juice so I used lemon. I cooked them in a skillet because my oven was busy. They were GREAT. I used the pan drippings and the leftover marinade to make a gravy and served the chicken and the gravy over brown rice. SO GOOD.

Ok, so I don't know if I did something wrong or what but my chicken turned out terrible!! I lost count on how many times my smoke alarm went off with the stupid broiler....A BROILER?! Seriously, just grill the chicken. I'm sure the taste would be fine on a grill but broiler....no. I ruined a really nice wedding gift cookie sheet trying this recipe. DO NOT BROIL!!! PUT ON A GRILL FOR SUCCESS! I gave it two stars instead of one because the flavor is one of those flavors that would be good given the correct cooking venue. I really can't even imagine what these peoples secret is that successfully broiled this meal. Maybe pour all the marinade over the chicken and let it cook at 350?? I don't know, just don't broil it.

Pretty tasty!  I used 2 chicken breasts but did not reduce the ingredients for the marinade so that I could have some "safe" marinade that had not touched the fish.  I thickened the extra marinade with cornstarch to make it more of a sauce consistency.  I might use OJ concentrate in the future to get a bigger orange flavor.

I seasoned two bone-in chicken breast with salt, lemon pepper, and rosemary. Then I browned each side in one tbls. olive oil in a small skillet. With breast side up I placed spoonfuls of frozen orange juice concentrate on top, turned the heat to low and covered for 25 mins. turning once midway. This was delish! The gravy is thick and is excellent on rice and the chicken.

Quick, easy and very tasty, for a "girls" dinner at home.  I removed as much of the skin as possible from the chicken.  Paired it with the South Beach cauliflower "mashed potatoes" and a tasty salad.

The marinade is light in taste yet still enough citrus burst to keep it alive, I like it.

I used chicken breasts but didn't adjust the cooking time so the outside was a little tough but otherwise this was a great recipe. Will def try again

I made this the other evening for friends and it was delicious! i added a splash of Gran Marnier to it as seen in a review. The only thing I might do differently is bake it, covered, for the first 25 min and then broil it. It was abit dry. I served it with roasted potatoes with rosemary, steamed fresh vegetables and a white chardonay. I will most definately make this again. It was easy, simple and most of the ingredients are on hand. Thanks :)

We ate every bite down to bone.  Instead of all OJ I used fresh squeezed oranges.  Some of the pulp added to the sweetness and juiceness of the sauce.

This was good and simple - I made it because I had some organges that were going to go bad so I wanted to juice them for this.  Worked out great - the chicken was very moist.

I used this recipe for a whole chicken and it turned out great.  I stuffed the chicken with onions and carrots, marinated it in the o.j. mixture, and then made a seperate orange rosemary sauce to go over the finished product.  Delicious!

I used boneless chicken breasts instead, and cooked them on the grill.   It didn't turn out how I expected it to at all, I couldn't really taste the orange. It was still good, though. Had a subtle flavor to it.  I agree with what someone else said, strain out the rosemary before you cook (if using dried), otherwise it tastes like you're eating pine needles.

This is a wonderful and subtle recipe. I know, with nearly a half cup of fresh herbs, it might make you think it's going to be overpowering - it's NOT! It's so tender, and juicy, and subtle. It has a very fresh taste to it, if that makes sense. I'd encourage everyone to at least try this recipe.

I made this recipe over memorial day weekend and my boyfriend loved it!  He said it was very tasty and the chicken was moist.  I thought so too, and loved the fact that it was easy.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice in addition to the fresh chives and rosemary; I think that definitely added to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.  Maybe next time I'll try it on the grill.

This was really good- my entire family liked it.  The rosemary and orange were a great pair.  I used dried chives, and fresh rosemary because that's what I had on hand.  I blended it all in my small food processor and marinated overnight in a plastic bag.  It was super tender.  When I added cornstarch it really thickened up quickly and I did have to thin a little with orange juice, but turned out great.  The sauce got a little dark under the broiler- was tasty.  I could see serving this over rice with a little extra sauce.  Will be making again.

I love the mix flavors of the rosemary and orange juice. To ensure the orange flavor stood out I used frozen concentrated orange juice and I let it sit for 8 hours. I baked it, uncovered for 50 mins at 350 degrees. It came out perfect.

I only gave this 4 stars because the flavor did not get into the chicken much at all. However the sauce over the top deserves a full 5 stars. It was light and fresh and very good. I will probably make this again but marinade the chicken even longer to see if the flavor comes through more. I used boneless skinless breasts for this.

We liked this.  My husband couldn't pin point the flavor and was surprised it was orange juice.  I halved the marinade and used 2 large boneless skinless breasts, baked at 350 for 30min. in a foil lined baking dish. This chicken was remarkably juicy.  My husband ate about 30 min later and his chicken was left in the oven that had been turned off and it was still very moist. I did sprinkle some salt on my chicken at the table, but my husband did not.  Will sprinkle with koser salt before serving next time.

I was running out of time and only marinaded for an hour, boy I wish I could have let it sit longer.  Even after an hour it was very good.  Next time I will plan ahead and I can't wait to see how wonderful it turns out.

This sounded like a good idea, but I was not pleased with the end result. To be fair, I didn't make it exactly as called for and maybe that was the problem. First, I didn't have fresh herbs, only dried, but I used the same amounts and it seemed like way too much. Also, I did throw it all in the crock pot. The end result was chicken that was coated in herbs and tasted strongly of them. In trying to salvage it, I spooned out all of the "marinade", added more orange juice and a jar of sweet orange marmalade preserves and some ground orange peel. At this point I think it is edible, although still coated in the herbs. Sadly, I won't be trying this again.

Was UNBELIEBLE!  My small kids LOVED it as well as my wife.  I actually made it with a Mixed Vegetable Rice recipe right from here and I took the left over "juice" that was left over and used as if it was a gravy for the rice.  I also served it with steamed broccolli.  IT'S A KEEPER!

The chicken tasted very good.  It is an easy dish to make, but is messy when you broil it.  The baking pan had some residue on it, but I was able to clean it with minimal effort.   I think it would be nice to cook on the grill.

In the end this turned out well and had a different flavor that I liked.  However, there were some bumps in the road.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts marinated overnight.  Broiling did not go well, so I ended up putting the chicken in a covered baking dish with the marinade and baked at 350.  I also halved the recipe because I used less chicken, but I wish I had not halved the marinade because I only had just enough, not a lot extra for sauce.  I am eating it now with rice, and once I added a good bit more salt & pepper it's pretty good.  If I make this again I will bake from the beginning & use orange juice with pulp as suggested in other reviews.

Well it sounded good and it tasted ok, but I'd expected more flavor than was delivered. I had originally planned to use boneless/skinless thighs and breasts as that is what my husband I prefer, but there were no thighs available at the grocery store today. I I even used fresh rosemary. But it just did not have the flavor I thought it would. I will try again w/the boneless/skinless parts and perhaps let it marinate all day. (this time it only had 5 hrs to marinate).

Though my chicken didn't turn out so well, I'm still going to give this recipe 4 stars because I believe any errors were my doing and not the recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the marinade gave them a really nice flavour. I did mine on the stove in a grill pan and they turned out a little dry but I'm pretty sure I overcooked them. Also, make sure you salt the chicken again before you cook it or else it will be bland. The recipe makes a lot of marinade so I think next time i'll half it. Other than that, I would definitely try this recipe again (with a few adjustments).

Great recipe! I did alter significantly as I was short on the ingredients and prep time listed- keeping the same flavor of the original recipe. I used 2 chicken quarters (with skin of course)seasoned with 1/2 the rosemary and salt and pepper. Browned in cast iron pan then added 1 tbs. lemon juice, 1 tsp. orange zest, and 1 can (or two lunch size portions) of madarin oranges. I added some chopped chives and the rest of the rosemary, and baked at 375 for 40 min, basting with the madarin mix a few times. SO tasty and delicious! My husband thought I spent a long time on the sauce and marinade- but we know the truth ;)

The only reason I'm giving it 1 star is for the juicy chicken it produced. I boiled the sauce and it tasted horrible. Thank goodness the chicken didn't taste like it even after marinading 24 hours.

This was quite tasty.  After reading reviews, I decided to substitute OJ concentrate in place of juice, and added a few tablespoons of water to thin it out a bit. I didn't have chives so I used green onions I had on hand. I didn't have enough time to marinate for 4 hours, so I gave it the 1/2 hour I had.  I had pounded the chicken breasts very thin before marinating.  I broiled, flipping and basting with the reserved 'decontaminated' marinade till done.  Served with white rice and citrus steamed veggies.  Hubby said it seemed healthy and it was pretty good.  I liked it second to breaded and fried orange chicken at chinese places.

Howdy folks.  We are adding a step to this recipe to boil the marinade before using it to baste the meat while cooking. This change should be published shortly. Thanks to those of you who noted it in your reviews!

Only gave four stars because I didnt make it exactly as stated.  I thickened the marinade (dont worry I brought it to a boil first) with cornstarch and basted it on the meat just before I took it off the grill.  Yummy!  With out the sauce on it I can see how this might be just a tad bland.  Great recipe though!

Tasty, but not for those who don't like herbs. When using fresh rosemary, break off a sprig, turn it around (not the way it grows) and run your hand down the length of the sprig to remove the rosemary "needles" from the branch. Quick and easy. Don't use the branch stalk itself because they are too tough.

This recipe was okay.
The orange taste that the orange juice gives the chicken is great, but the fresh rosemary was over-powering.
I would recommend only using half that amount.

Never would have thought of orange as a flavor to complement chicken, but it was delicious!  Easy to make, healthy, and my family and I loved it.  Next time, I'll probably follow Fastcooker's advice and add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic either broiled or on the grill!  I added the zest of one orange to the marinage to really bring out the orange flavor.  I loved the suggestion of saving the marinade, boiling and thickening it to serve with the chicken.  I served with mixed grilled vegetable (mushrooms, peppers, onions)skewers and rice.

This is a excellent recipe for grilling chicken too.  I usually prepare in the morning and let marinade all day before grilling for supper.  The negative of this recipe is I never have leftovers even when I make extra.

This recipe is one of my very faves! The flavor is incredible, especially if you have freshly picked oranges and rosemary. It's so great hot or cold. When I cannot grill it outside, I have then baked it at 350 degrees for approx. an hour. I check it with a thermometer to confirm when done. This is an incredible hit with everyone who has tasted it, and I have shared the recipes many times.

Absolutely loved the sauce.  After marinating the chicken in it all day(about 9 hours), none of the flavor went into the chicken.  Next time, I will bake/grill chicken w/o marinating, especially if I forget to plan ahead and want to make it at the last minute.  Sauce was GREAT with a couple minor adustments.  I used Wondra instead of cornstarch to thicken it up (Wondra is VERY easy to work with--no lumps at all).  After adding in flour or cornstarch or Wondra though, the orange flavor gets muted a lot, so I added in a bunch of orange zest (1-2 tbsp I think---until a nice orange aroma comes back) to get some of that flavor back without watering it down again.  I used my sauce to cover my chicken and potatoes (or rice) and it was fabulous.....I gave 4 stars because I really enjoyed the sauce!

Well, I have to say that initially, I was excited about this recipe, and honestly, it just didn't "do it" for me. Maybe it was the fact that I used dried chives instead of freash? Dunno. I will say, however, that this is the most tender chicken I have ever made.

Easy, Fast, Impress Company. I needed a quick meal that I could make for company on a worknight, this was perfect. I combined the dry marinade ingredients in a gallon bag the night before so I could just add the chicken, oj, and oil in the morning before work. When I got home it was ready to put in the oven. I followed other reviews and added some cornstarch to some grand mariner to thicken the sauce. Served with wild rice and broccoli sauted with garlic. For dessert I marinated peaches in grand mariner and served over peach frozen yogurt, complimented dinner nicely. Seriously easy meal that looked very impressive on the table.

Very good, refreshing flavor. Followed the recipe with exception of using dried rosemary and grilling chicken boneless, skinless breasts on the "George".  Very good, will use again and again I'm sure. Thanks!

Extremely moist and has a slight taste, but with all the basting and marinading we thought it would have a stronger taste. No orange flavor at all. But tasty chicken! Just need to have really interesting sides, as it is just plain, moist chicken.

I marinated this overnight, and it was just alright for me.  Chicken was a little dry.  I don't think cooking chicken under a broiler works very well.  The marinade flavor came thru b'c I marinated overnight, but the taste didn't wow me.

This was a fantastic dish. Very juicy and with a nice flavor.  I marinated most of the day.  Then strained the marinade, added some cornstarch and served as a sauce over the chicken.  I'd give it 5 stars but it wasn't a very complex flavor.

I made this last night and it was yummy!  I left out the chives because I didn't have any and everybody gobbled it up.  I wish I would have made more! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt the orange taste was a little strong.

Great flavor. Instead of baking, we barbequed the chicken and still brushed in frquently with the remaining marinade mixture.

Simple, quick (bc I forgot to do it ahead and didn't marinate...it was still good, but next time I'll let it soak up the flavors for a few hours) and diffenet from the normal chicken I make.  Will do again.

We enjoyed this chicken - I let the chicken marinate for about 4 hours, and then followed the added direction of boiling the mixture before basting it on the chicken as it cooked (thickened up the sauce too). I had big chicken pieces, so cooked it for about 20 minutes on an indoor grill, and then put it in the oven at 350 F until it reached 180 degrees - which took another 1/2 hour. Has anyone broiled this recipe - I can't imagine broiling  for 30 minutes - my oven would be filthy?

I made this recipe after the great reviews and even after following the suggested tips for improvement, I thought this recipe was bland.  I did taste the orange and rosemary but nothing that I would repeat.  My husband thought it was good and liked the sauce, which I made a separate batch of.  Just so-so..

Easy to make and great flavor though it was very subtle. We tend to like a stronger flavor or sauce so it was a little plain for us. I think next time I will take another users suggestion and save some extra marinade to thicken a bit and make a sauce to pour on top...

I agree with reviewer Sandra, you MUST BOIL THE MARINADE to make it save to use during the cooking process(Think raw chicken juices back on your cooked chicken.)  Next time I will make the sauce too.

This was good.  I don't know if it was worth the mess it left on my pan.  Took me forever to get it off!  Good flavor though.

Really enjoyed these grilled. I marinated overnight and they were tender and citrusy. I only gave it a 4 because I'm not sure that it's a taste that we'd want very often. It is a nice summer taste though.
