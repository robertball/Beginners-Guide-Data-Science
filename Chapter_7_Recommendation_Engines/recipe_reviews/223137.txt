WOW! What a great muffin recipe! Very moist and tasty. The only change I made was using dark chocolate covered raisins and not soaking them in water. We will definitely have this again. Thanks.

Instead of soaking the raisins in plain hot water, I soaked them in hot unsweetened chai. I did not have coconut oil, I used all butter. I also used regular flour as I did not have bread flour. I increased the vanilla to a full teaspoon. Before baking, I sprinkled each muffin mound with cinnamon-sugar. My muffins were done baking at 20 minutes. Delicious! The whole family loved them. We didn't even make it to breakfast tomorrow--came home from work tonight and they were half gone.

Great muffins...really moist and tasty! I made them as mini muffins for my 16 month old and he ate 3 of them as soon as they came out of the oven and it wasn't even meal time :) I only made a few small changes: I used healthy oil instead of butter, I chopped up apricots(without soaking) instead of using raisins, I used 2 tablespoons of flax, and finally I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and they were plenty sweet! Thank you for such a great recipe. Next time I think i'll add some pecans and blueberries.

This recipe is amazing! My husband, 9 year old, 7 year old and 1 year old scarfed them down! I only made a few minor changes - doubled the vanilla, added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used molasses instead of brown sugar because we are cutting back on refined sugar. Otherwise followed it to a T. The first batch went so fast, I am doubling it when I make it again this week so I can freeze some.

(A great base recipe too...you could shred zuchinni in it instead of carrots etc.)

This is a great recipe.  It can be "changed up" in many different ways without affecting the overall end product in a negative way.  Combine all the wet ingredients together first.  Sift all the dry ingredients together and add to the wet ingredients last.  But here is the *REAL* secret to the best muffins. Gently fold in the dry ingredients to the wet ones until just barely incorporated.  You may still see some dry areas or lumps but that is perfectly okay. Gently spoon the mixture into the cups.  DO NOT "press" the mixture into the cups.  DO NOT bang the muffin tin on the counter to reduce air pockets (like you would a cake) either.  Treat them gently and bake as per the directions.  If you follow these tips you will have nicely raised, fluffy, moist muffins.  If you don't... well... you can always use them for hockey pucks!

Super yummy. I changed up the recipe a little bit. I used craisins instead of raisins, and peach mango apple sauce because that was all I had in the refrigerator, and just used one cup of regular all purpose flour instead of bread and wheat flour. Literally fell out of the pan when I tipped it, which was great. I would make these again. I might doctor it up even more by adding more craisins, or carrots, or blueberries. Really anything. This is just a great recipe for a really moist muffin.

These are good... SOOOOOOO GOOD!  My 20-month-old loved them, as did the rest of us.  They are extremely moist, and almost have a spongy consistency to them (in a good way) ;)  I accidentally grated almost double the amount of carrots I needed, so I just threw them in anyway, and it worked out fine!  They also came out of the pan very easily... came out in one perfect piece and did not break or get stuck as I often have trouble with (I used mini muffin pans.)  I can see these will be a staple around our house from now on, perhaps I will make a few batches at a time and then throw them in the freezer and take a few out when we will be on the road and the kids need a healthy snack.  Thanks so much for this recipe!! :D

These are great. Super moist and really healthy. I've made them with bread flour as indicated or all with regular flour and it really makes no difference. I replace half the butter with extra apple sauce and half with extra coconut oil to make them even healthier. I like to use coconut sugar since it has a lower glycemic index and I tend to decrease the amount to 1/3 of a cup - they are still plenty sweet because of the bananas and apple sauce. Both my husband and 2 year old love them.

These muffins were fairly gross.  They came out soggy and didn't rise as much as would be expected.  I would not recommend making them and my whole family loves muffins!

Really enjoyable recipe! My three year old son loves these! I don't use raisins; instead I use dark chocolate chips. Sometimes I add finely grated zucchini to sneak extra veg in. One of my go-to recipes for sure.

LOVE!!!  These are soooo delicious. My 21 month old will not eat any veggies & he ate these up like candy! My very picky husband also loves them They are a new staple on my weekly menu. What a great snack on the go or a snack for the kids. I didn't have any vanilla so I added cinnamon instead and also threw in a tbsp of Brewers Yeast for fun. So moist & yummy.

My kid that refuses to eat all vegetables exclaimed "These are so good... Even with carrots!" I did substitute all applesauce for the oil & butter. Turned out great. Very moist. Do need to fill muffin cups all the way to the top.

Great moist muffins easy for my 9mn old to eat as his first finger foods!  First time I made it I used chopped prunes instead of raisins and will continue, they come out sweeter and the fruit is softer than raisins tend to be.

This is an excellent recipe.  The muffins came out super moist and tasty.  The only changes I made were to use all purpose flour and left out the whole wheat flour (I found bugs in mine. ick).  I also did as another suggested and put some turbinado sugar and cinnamon on top and also some pecans to the batter which added a nice flavor and texture.  I'll make this again.  Thanks.

Third time making these muffins - great each time. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the coconut oil. Perfect addition for something sweet in lunches.

My 3 year old and 1 year old loved and so did I! Next time make it I will make some changes.  1 tsp of vanilla and maybe 1 and a half bananas so it's not to soggy. But it tastes so good.  Maybe I'll throw in more carrots in next time as well.  Loved it

I substituted chocolate chips for raisins.  I found the muffin a bit soft for my tastes, next time I will try adding oats. And maybe nuts. Otherwise this was great!

These turned out awesomely. I didn't even use bread flour - just a cup of whole wheat flour. I'm super impressed. So are my kids. (I threw in some cinnamon for good measure - it goes so well with apples, bananas and carrots that I thought I couldn't go wrong - and I was right.)

Great recipe! I had to work around what I had in the house so I only used one banana, no raisins, a cup of shredded carrots, 1c all purpose flour, 1/4c oats, and only about 1/4c coconut sugar. My one year old loved it! (And so do I!) I made them into mini muffins. Pic on my Instagram @alyssasfoodpics

I made this to the recipe, omitting flaxseeds. They didn't rise much and were soggy. I would give them three stars, except both my husband and young daughter liked them a lot, and that earns an extra star. 
It's also worth mentioning that these require a full set of mixing bowls and many measuring and mixing tools, making for a little extra cleanup than usual for a baking recipe.

I enjoyed the taste, was nice to have a different muffin, but mine came out too greasy, so next time I will cut back on the butter or coconut oil. I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free all purpose baking mix as a substitute for both flours, I also used cinnamon applesauce because that's what I had. Next time I will add some cinnamon to the dry ingredients too. My somewhat picky, gluten free 11 year old thought they were just ok.

I really liked these muffins, healthy enough for me to eat :) My kids really really liked these muffins, sweet & tasty enough to ask for seconds. I wasn't in the mood for raisins, so I substituted chopped up dried apricots and I also halved the brown suger....& it was still de-lish. 
Next time, I am going to half the fat content since, to me, they came out rather oily and are high in saturated fat.

They came out great tasting, but not much height - I think I had all the right amounts, so only thing I can think of is that I added nuts and that could be why?  Does anyone know any other reason?  I used the 1/2 t of baking soda.

This recipe, as-is, is great! It is a real kid-pleaser; my first batch was gone by the time they were cooled. I did notice a bit of sogginess in the centers, so in subsequent batches I skipped soaking the raisins and baked them an extra few minutes.  This is quickly becoming a go-to snack for us. Oh, and regarding the butter and coconut oil; they contain healthy fats that promote brain development in kids, so don't hold back!

Still yet to try them with my finicky grandson, but I enjoyed the taster. I used butter instead of coconut oil and included half cup blueberries. Very moist and tasty.

Soooo good! I didn't have applesauce but had some homemade peach/plum/pear puree that I used instead. And I added a little bit of cinnamon. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making these all throughout the year for my kids to send in their lunches.

My kids go nuts for this! I usually make a double batch and freeze half for later :) I add in chia seeds sometimes as well and have substituted other baby food in this recipe as well! Cannot go wrong with this recipe!

Quite dense and eggy, these muffins didn't rise too much. But great flavour, both kids love them. Didn't have applesauce on hand, so we just grated two apples, skin and all, that worked fine. May use a little more flour and baking powder next time.
