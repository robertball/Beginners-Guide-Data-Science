This pie was featured in the Allrecipes magazine I just received. I made this pie prior to thanksgiving to see if it was worthy. IT IS NOT. There is an error in the recipe. I suspect it is with the amount of half and half. I reviewed the recipe along with my mother to see where I may have made an error but couldn't find it. It never set up for me. The pie was in the refrigerator for 5-6 hours and was liquid still. I set the timer while cooking too, so I know I cooked it long enough. I have no idea where I went wrong.

I really enjoyed this once I got past the fact that it tasted like pumpkin without the custard like texture.  I made the filling exactly as instructed and it set up wonderfully. I put it in a graham cracker crust and did not serve it with whipped cream. next time I think I will use the filling over a cheese cake base. YUM!

It never set. I was upset because it was easy to make and sounded delicious.

This is a confusing recipe. The magazine states there is a40 minute cook time. Here the recipe states there is a 20 minute cooking time. There needs to be specific directions to stir until the ingredients thicken. Otherwise the pie tastes great.

I made a pie similar to this one last year for Christmas. This year, my little sister begged me to make it again for thanksgiving. Unsure of what my original recipe was, I settled on this one. While on the stove top, my custard was still rather liquidy at seven minutes. At nine minutes, though, it suddenly went from liquid and foamy on top, to a thick custard. In the span of about thirty seconds, it thickened up and all the foam mixed in perfectly. At that point I reduced the heat for the last minute. I'm not sure what the point of the strainer was, mostly it just seemed to be messy. I'll skip that step next time. Otherwise, this pie was a breeze! I'll be using this one whenever my sister asks from now on.
