Very good! I had this for lunch today and it was super simple to put together and very tasty! I would've never thought to make a vinaigrette using avocado, but it's a GREAT idea. I did cut the recipe down, but that was my only change. I would make this refreshing salad again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good! Nice flavour with the lime and avocado. Kids even liked it!
