I didn't like it. But, instead of throwing it out I added a tablespoon of strawberry jam and a tablespoon of apricot preserves and it added some flavor and made it drinkable!

me and my brother made this one. It's tasted to chalking with the cocoa powder so we added another tbs of sugar, 1/2 cup blackberries, tbs of honey. The honey definitely helped allot.

Next time I make this I'm using chocolate syrup. I like dark chocolate as much as anyone, but the cocoa powder was too bitter even when I added more sugar.

I didn't like this much when I first tasted it, but the flavor grew on me. It is not very sweet and has a muted flavor. It might be a little bolder with more blueberries. I used fresh blueberries.

I thought it was a very good recipe, however, I added a half cup more blueberries than called for, I thought the chocolate was more overpowering than the blueberries. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, it really added flavor. I recommend this recipe, just to let you know, add more blueberries than called for. 
Tip: Chocolate syrup works well for this recipe, too.

I did it exactly as is, and it wasn't very good. Couldn't taste the blueberries so I added another tablespoon, and I also added a little more sugar because it wasn't sweet at all. Even after that, it still wasn't very good. I probably won't make it again.

I didn't care for this. It was too thick and just tasted like watered down cocoa powder.
