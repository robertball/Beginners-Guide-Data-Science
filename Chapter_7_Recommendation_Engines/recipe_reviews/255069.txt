This is a very good recipe. The only thing that keeps me from giving it the full 5 stars is the eggs. In my humble opinion, one cup of quinoa can easily handle 5 eggs, maybe six. The amount of cheese in this one keeps everything together and works well to make up for only having 4 eggs. Perhaps that's just personal preference, but we like our eggs around here, and it is breakfast. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Great dish! I was too lazy to make individual muffins, so I used a pie pan and made a quiche equivalent. I also added fresh spinach and used milk instead of cream because that is what I had in the House. I wasnâ€™t crazy about the taste of cheddar with this, so the 2nd time I made it, I used an Italian Blend instead...just my preference.

Great healthy dish for breakfast or lunch.  My 3 and 5 year old children even loved it. I added some elk sausage to a few of them and that was a nice touch.  I think the amount of eggs as listed is just right. I actually didn't have cream on hand so I used leftover homemade white gravy.

I made these to freeze and have on hand for quick mornings that I needed protein.  A quick 20 seconds in the microwave to warm them up and run out the door.  They are delicious!  I altered the recipe to be more low fat by omitting the butter and cream.  Instead I sprayed the pan with olive oil Pam and used skim milk.  I also added an extra egg as the other reviewer suggested.  The broccoli cooked perfectly.  Next time, I plan to try using 3 egg whites and 2 whole eggs to cut down on fat even further.  My 9 year old is begging for me to make them again!

If I make this again, I'll add pepper.  I was too bland.
