This turned out great. Kind of surprised… It’s so simple. I used turkey bacon, and made sure it was crisp to break into the pie. Used three eggs, and half cup of milk to add a little bit more body to the pie. Turned out great. Watch carefully the number of salt elements into the pie. Had to be careful not to over Salt.
