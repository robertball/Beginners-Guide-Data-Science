Blueberry Banana Oatmeal Smoothie Haiku: "No sugar needed, if banana's super ripe. (Swapped flax for chia.") I'm not terribly fond of blueberries in smoothies, but my daughter wanted me to make this one for her, but all we ended up tasting was oats and bananas. It definitely had a "healthier" taste than most smoothies, but something didn't jive w/ me, and chances are, it was the blueberries. (DD; however, loved it.)

I really like smoothies like this one that pack in the nutrition. I used almond milk and stevia instead of soy milk and sugar. I also like to blend my oats up into a fine powder first to avoid a gritty taste. A delicious, ice cold smoothie I'll make again.

I did not need the sugar as my banana was VERY ripe. I also used regular cow's milk. I made no other changes. Very good. I would increase the blueberries next time but that's really just a personal preferance.

I used fresh banana, fresh blueberries, soy milk, and maple & brown sugar instant oatmeal.  I didn't add the sugar to see how it would taste without it.  I did not use the other ingredients either because I didn't have them.  I followed the measurements exactly.  The oatmeal flavor came out strong, so I omitted it and the smoothie tasted good with just blueberries, banana, and soy milk.

Very tasty. I added extra blueberries and used vanilla flavored almond milk. I omitted the extra sugar and vanilla extract. I also added ice since my fruit was not already frozen.

I made the smoothie with cow's milk & fresh banana's instead of frozen. And It tasted great! Though I would recommend making it with frozen banana's so it's colder. I added some extra blueberry's and it made a big difference. I definitely would make this smoothie again.

Made this with almond milk (it's what I had on hand) and liquid stevia as sweetener. Delicious!

Very good. I added flax as well and omitted the sugar. Will make again and try a few more blueberries.

Simple, refreshing, and filling. I love the way it sneaks in chia seeds. I made a very similar smoothie with strawberries instead of blueberries, and liked that one a little better.

I had high hopes for this one. I like chocolate oatmeal smoothies and banana oatmeal smoothies. The blueberry just did not work for me. I followed the recipe exactly. Neither the bueberry or banana had a dominant flavor. Mostly I could taste the additional ingredients giving the smoothie almost a grape vitamin flavor. I gave it a 3, because I might be able to adjust the flavor.
