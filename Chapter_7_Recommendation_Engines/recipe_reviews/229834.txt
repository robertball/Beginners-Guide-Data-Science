I use wild organic blueberries for this and it's delicious and perfect every time. I have made these about a dozen times now. They are delicate but I have never had issues, mess free. The taste is more crepe than pancake but that just means they are more flavorful to me. My 4 year old loves these.

I'm happy to be the first reviewer of this recipe because it's a winner!  I scaled this down to half, prepared the batter in the blender (so easy), and used my griddle which cooked six at a time (the perfect quantity for today).  These are somewhere between a pancake and a crepe, more like a crepe in texture but smaller in size.  They are a little delicate, so take care when flipping, however, I had no problem with the pancake breaking when I spooned in the blueberry sauce and did the fold over.  Have your sauce and whatever else you plan to serve ready, as they cook very quickly.  This is a 5-star recipe IMO and this is going into my Favorites folder.  Would be a really nice brunch item with nice presentation but, most importantly, this tastes incredibly good!

lutzflcat was right.  The "pancakes" are delicate, TOO delicate; I tried to flip them over, only to make a mess out of them.  If I had waited any longer, I would have burned them.  And the pancakes didn't taste like pancakes at all; they tasted more like omelets. In fact, given that the main ingredients were 6 eggs and 1 cup cottage cheese, I should have expected them to taste like that.  The only thing I liked was the blueberry compote; it's more fit for an ice cream topping, and is the only reason why I'll keep this recipe in my recipe box. I won't try this again, ever.

This recipe is pretty good!  A healthy spin on pancakes!  I wanted to start having a healthier breakfast and this one is perfect for protein and low carbs.  My husband really enjoyed them too.  At 3 you start to get a lil egged out but the fruit sauce makes it a lot better.
