very moist and chewy! But this does need changes...This recipe calls for alot of sugar to replace the taste lost in the low fat PB and margarine. If you're using regular Margarine and PB, 3/4 (brown)sugar is enough. I also used 3/4 cup PB instead of 1/2, and added half teaspoon of vannila essence.

My husband loves soft peanut butter cookies, and my old recipe was too crispy for him. This one was perfect, with some changes. I used equal parts of the sugar and brown sugar because I was almost out of brown sugar, and I used more peanut butter. I still found it lacking in the flavor department, so I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also followed someone elses tip and lowered the baking temp to 350 and went about eleven minutes.

These are unbelievably fantastic!  They practically vanished overnight!  I added chocolate chips and a teaspoon of vanilla.  YUMMY!  And super moist.

More like 3 1/2 stars as I had to make a decent amount of adjustments. For one this recipe used far too little peanut butter! I used the called for amount and tasted the batter and barely tasted the PB. I ended up having to add 2 cups worth for a real peanuty flavor. I added 1/4 cup cane sugar and 1 cup brown. I use energy egg re-placer instead of egg as I never see it necessary to make s baked good dairy if it doesn't need to be. I skipped the butter as it's unnecessary since the peanut oil subs for the purpose of the butter and I used about 1 cup of water. I added peanut butter chips too. Didn't bother cooling the batter as it was clear it was the perfect consistency so don't waste your time fridging overnight! Who wants to wait for that?! As always I baked one cookie to make sure it was the right texture. These need to be formed (what I call holding hand cookies) as you cannot just roll the batter into a ball and place on the sheet & expect them to mold themselves in the shape of a cookie. You must roll the batter in a pretty large golf ball sized ball and then flatten. About 5 min into the baking process I make fork indents in the centers. I also made some w/ chocolate chips. Came out moist (help of the water) semi0chewy and not dry at all. Will make again based on my adjustments.

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've found yet!  I rolled them out into bigger balls, refrained from flattening them, then pressed a Hershey's kiss into the middle of each one as soon as they came out of the oven.  I sent some to work with my husband, and all the guys requested that I send in more.  The dough keeps well in the fridge for a few days, so all you have to do is pull it out and bake it for fresh cookies.  Much better than the crunchy cookie recipes I've run across.

This turned out to be a really great cookie! I followed the recipe, but i did add alittle more PB like others had advised about 3/4 cup total. I also cooked them at about 350 which browned the tops and bottoms lightly and left the centers still chewy! The best PB cookies i have ever made, thanks for the recipe!

Unbelievable!  My friends nicknamed these cookies a "Party in your mouth" cookies.  They are excellent!  I followed previous hint and added additional peanut butter.

This is the only PB cookie recipe you will ever need, it is that good! I added 1t. vanilla as some one else suggested. I used a small scoop to make little cookies and then put a pb frosting between to cookies for a cute dessert. Thanks for an amazing recipe! :)

I like extra peanut taste so increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and reduced the white sugar to 1/4. Bake for 8 minutes at 350 for a softer, chewy cookie or for 9 minutes for a crunchier cookie. Delicious!

After reading some of the reviews, I offer these tips; use butter and add in a generous amount of peanut butter.  Beat until light and fluffy before adding other ingredients.  Rather than flatten the cookies with a fork, use a cookie scoop and leave dough as a scoop on cookie sheet to bake.  Cookies will spread while baking but will not flatten out and therefore you will enjoy a great chewy p.b. cookie!
One final tip; before placing batter on cookie sheets, take a small scoop and roll in your hands, if the dough is too "greasey" add a little bit more flour to the dough.  Perfect cookie dough uses butter at room temp (not microwaved for any length of time)!

I loved this recipe, made delicious, chewy peanut butter cookies! The only thing I changed was I added more peanut butter, (a little over a cup) a teaspoon of vanilla, and I added an egg to add to the chewiness! I cooked it at 350 like someone suggested and they came out perfect, my roommate and boyfriend went crazy over them!

Moist, chewy, and delicious.  I did not use reduced fat products in these cookies.  They turned out just like we wanted them to and they were gone in a day.

These appear to be the same recipe as the very popular Classic Peanut Butter Cookies on this site (halve that recipe for measurements and use butter and equal parts of both sugars). That is what I did because most p.b. cookie recipes I looked at called for equal sugars and also I prefer to bake with unsalted butter rather than margarine. Couldn't wait to refrigerate hours so I just kept dough in fridge as each batch baked. Put in the extra p.b. as many suggested, nice texture but needed something additional, crushed peanuts maybe. Baked at 350 for nine minutes. Some I just lightly placed on sheet others I rolled in balls and pressed down with a fork. Nice either way. I let them sit on baking sheet for one to two minutes after coming out of the oven as they seemed very soft, then removed to cooling rack!

I used this recipe as a base for coraline cookies (little pb button cookies) & I reduced both the brown and white sugar by 1/4 cup each, added a splash of vanilla, and used a heaping 1/2 cup of regular peanut butter (it was probably close to 2/3c).  My first batch of these left me feeling pretty dissapointed... I put my dough in the freezer for about 20min & sprayed my pan with non stick spray... the cookies spread on the bottoms, crumbled around the edges, and although they tasted good, they weren't something id serve to guests. However for my next batch, I left the dough in the freezer for almost three hours and didn't use any non stick spray on my cookie sheet... they came out perfect this way, they didn't stick either. So to anyone making these: make sure your dough has plenty of time to chill like the recipe says! And unlike other peanut butter cookies on this site (even ones that call for a full cup of pb) these had a great peanut butter taste, they were moist and chewy in the middle and slightly crisp around the edges. This will be my go to peanut butter cookie recipe from now on with those changes I made.

very tasty cookies! I followed some of the reviews, cut the sugar and added more PB. The only negative thing I have to say is that I eat all of the cookies in two days.

I used normal butter and peanut butter, baked for not even 10 minutes at 350 and they turned out great.  Nice and chewy, just as I wanted.  Although, if you are going for a real peanut buttery taste, add more, but the 1/2 cup was just fine for me.

A four because of the modifications I made based on other reviews - went up to 3/4 c. peanut butter (regular, did not have reduced fat on hand) and baked at 345 degrees. Next time I will try using 1 c. peanut butter and cutting back on the margarine. Also, they flattened well without any help from me.

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments that will please the health-conscious. And the cookies turned out perfect! 
I used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 margarine; a bit more peanut butter than called for, no white sugar at all, only the 3/4 cup brown sugar. I only needed 3/4 to 1 cup tops of flour, and added vanilla.
I did not chill the dough either but rolled it into balls, flattened them with fork, baked them 9 minutes at 330-350, and they came out tasting and looking awesome, chewy and not flat. Made 33 smallish cookies. Love them! Thanks...

Loved this recipe used the helpful advice from some reviewers and used 3/4 cup peanut butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and used reg margarine and reg peanut butter and baked it at 350 for about 12 - 13 minutes on parchment paper!  They are so moist and chewy even the next day!

Best peanut butter cookies I have made yet! I used regular peanut butter and regular margarine. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. Once they were finished cooking I topped them in the middle with a chocolate rose bud. These went very well with the peanut butter taste, much better than kisses. Thanks!

I tried this recipe, it was great. Very moist and chewy, I did add about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and spinkled them with a little bit of cinnamon sugar, awsome cookies!

These are great cookies!!  The only thing I would recommend is changing the cooking temperature to 325 degrees F and 8-9 minutes.  My first batch burnt in 6 min with the 375 temperature.

These are very good.  I only made a couple of changes.  Like others I did add a tsp of vanilla extract.  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I let the butter and egg get to room temp.  I did not refrigerate the dough and they turned out great!  I also used regular p.b and marg. Will be adding to my favourite cookie recipes

These cookies are very good and turned out great using Sunbutter in place of peanut butter since my son has a peanut allergy. I also increased the Sunbutter by 1/4 cup and added chocolate shavings to the top right after taking them out of the oven.

Peanut butter cookies are my husband's favorite and I've finally found this wonderful recipe to make chewy cookies. All other recipes I've tried do not even compare to this one. Also, I never bake cookies as long as a recipe states, even with this one I only baked them for 8 minutes to ensure chewiness. What goodness!!!!!

I didn't use low fat anything. The cooking time for me was spot on. I was hoping for more peanut butter taste. To me it could have used more PB. Overall good recipe and asside from adding more PB next time, I will make these again. Thanks

These were the best PN cookies I have had. I added a little more peanut butter (3/4c total) and a teaspoon of vanilla. I found that if I baked them just 30 seconds shorter, they are a little softer. Just the way I like them :D.

These cookies turned out well. The only change I made was using full fat margarine and peanut butter. I also only used the brown sugar and cooked these for 9 minutes instead of 10.

I was very disappointed with the texture of these cookies.  Unless they are hot out of the oven they aren't chewy at all.  Aside from that it's a good basic peanut butter cookie recipe.  Someone ought to change the name.

These actually turned out really well the first time, usually it takes a bit of tweaking!  I followed the recipe exactly, but for substituting butter for the margarine.  Once the cookies were cool I dipped them in melted milk chocolate & let them set on a piece of baking paper in the fridge.  They're brilliant, I'll make them again for sure!

i don't know, maybe i missed something crucial, but these were neither moist nor chewy when i was done with them.  i checked and rechecked the recipe and i think that i followed it exactly, but who knows?  maybe i used the wrong brand of peanut butter or something.  either way, this recipe earns a 2/5 from me.

I used 3/4 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and the flattening didn't seem to be a big problem at all -- in fact, they came out quite rounded. However, my first batch came out burnt on the bottom and set off the smoke detector! For the second batch, I flattened with a fork to the desired thickness, and I reduced the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for 9-10 minutes, and they came out much better. I also stirred in about a 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the second batch and it kept it more moist. As the cookies cooled, they did get rather dry. A good starter recipe, but needed modifications.

Very Delicious! I decided to make these last minute so I was unable to chill the dough overnight. Instead, I stuck it in the freezer for 30 minutes and it worked just fine. I would highly recommend using parchment paper when baking the cookies. I also decided not to flatten them, and to add a hershey kiss to them upon taking them out of the oven. If you want to do this, you will need to bake the cookies slightly longer. I put the hershey kisses in the fridge for 10 minutes while the cookies were baking so they didn't melt when I added them to the freshly baked cookies. Overall a great recipe!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I prefer to use regular peanut butter and softened butter instead of reduced fat peanut butter and margarine for a richer taste.  Also I find that letting the dough set in the refrigerator for a few hours really allows them to bake up quite well.  I'm not a fan of peanut butter, but I absolutely love this recipe!

I followed the recipe, put it in the oven and it came out a big giant mess. It looked like the dough melted together into a giant brownie or sheet cake. I don't know if I didn't put enough baking power in. It said 1/2 a teaspoon. Maybe the margarine and peanut butter I used effected it because they were sort of adjacent to peanut butter and margarine. I don't know but...

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!!!  If they are not chewy you probably over cooked them.  My oven burns a little hot so I only left them in for about 8 minutes and they turned out chewy and delicious.

So YUMMMMY! I love chewy cookies and was looking for a new recipe and this is it. I followed the recipe for the most part just didnt use lowfat peanut butter (and added about an extra 1/4 c of it), added about a half a bag of peanut butter chips, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Cooked at 350 for 12 mins. I did not refridgerate the dough and the cookies werent super thick but were just perfect for me. Flavor was awesome though, putting this one in the recipe box!

These were very tasty but cooked larger and flatter then I expected. 1st batch come out to crispy, lowered the cooking time by 2 mins still a little crispy but had some of the chewiness we were looking for.  Also used suggested method for add kiss but substituted left over Halloween mini candy bars.

This is a great recipe - I made a batch of these and entered them at our county fair.  I took 3rd place. Not bad considering there were lots of peanut butter cookies entered and the 1st place cookie took best cookie overall.

I substituted melted butter for the margarine, and added toasted walnuts and peanut butter chips, and they were fantastic!  I baked them a shorter time than called for as well (I normally do with all cookies) - once they set, they're really chewy and moist.  Not dry at all.

Followed advice of some others, regular pb & regular margarine.  teaspoon of vanilla added also & incresed the PB to 3/4 cup

I am not a person that cooks often and got rave reviews for these so thanks to all that provided some feedback on this recipe!

these are great peanut butter cookies!  i used smart balance margarine and regular natural peanut butter and whole wheat flour, egg whites...also added some vanilla.  in half the batter, i added some wheat germ and choc chip cookies.  also rolled the balls in white sugar before flattening/baking them.  all the cookies turned out fabulous and my husband and i really enjoyed them.  will use this recipe again.  also, i found that these didn't need to be chilled before baking them.  texture is perfect.

My boys are gobbling them up as I speak.  I did not have reduced fat products so used the normal ones.  I rolled them to about walnut sized then flattened to about 1/4 of an inch...we like them and will make them again but will use a little bit more peanut butter, and make it crunchy.  I did not roll them in sugar either, but they were plenty sweet.  Another note, ours turned out crunchy...but we like them that way.

These cookies turned out so yummy!  My husband prefers these cookies to be soft and chewy, and they definitely were.  Mine did spread out a lot wider than anticipated, but it was just more to enjoy and did not dry out the cookie.

These are sooo yummy. I made them for a friend who likes peanut butter cookies. I loved them! They are chewy and great. They also do not taste too peanutty which is really good. Definitely would recommend these.

I quadrupled this recipe and substituted with butter and regular peanut butter.  Cookies were delicious but were on the flat side.  Otherwise, great.

I didn't use the low fat recipe.  I refridgerated the dough for about 10 minutes, and cooked right away! they turned out fantastic! My family loved them! I'll definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

These are chewy, but not what I was looking for. I agree with another review that said they were gooey. I popped them in for longer, but they were still gooey. They flattened out a bit too flat for my liking too. :( 
Not a bad tasting cookie. Just not what I was looking for. 
I'd rate it lower because I'm disappointed, but in all fairness they are chewy. Even once completely cooled, they were falling apart they were so "chewy".

These cookies turned out thin and crisp for me.  I followed the recipe exact.  I tried baking 7 min.- too gooey.  I will try again, these just weren't the cookie I was looking for.

What a great recipe!  I didn't use reduced fat anything, and I didn't worry about the criss cross marks, instead I shaped the balls into  buscuit shapes, about 1 1/2" diameter and they cooked beautifully! My husband and I agree, very, very good - very moist and chewy!  THANK YOU!!!

My husband said it was perfect. I changed it slightly to accommodate my supplies. I used 3x the amount of baking powder bc I didn’t have baking soda. I used equal amount of sugar (2/4 cups or 1/2) and added vanilla flavoring as suggested by another user.

Loved these cookies! I used butter instead of margarine and full fat peanut butter. I dropped the white sugar and only used the 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I skipped the salt and baked at 350.

I didn't use low-fat anything, but it still tastes great! Next time I would say bake for 12 minutes instead of ten, and put a little extra Peanut Butter in...... maybe 1/4 of a cup....... Came out great thanks!

I had to use a stick of butter and regular ALDI peanut butter.  Everyone, even the ones who dislike peanut butter, will gladly accept more! So glad I don't have to double this recipe.

Excellent and very easy to make.  Mine came out a little bit too large, but otherwise, they are awesome (in all honesty, I think I goofed/reversed the baking powder & baking soda teaspoon measurements).

I'm really excited about these cookies. Albeit, I made them for my boyfriend and he hasn't gotten home from work yet, so I don't have the full review ready....I'm enjoying the way they've turned out, myself. I followed momofmy4crazykids' review and am in the process of making a wonderful pb frosting for the middle :) I can't wait!

These are awesome! Very tasty, moist and chewy just the way my family likes them. I made the dough and my daughter made the cookies 2 days later. She used 1/4 C dough for each cookie! Even being huge, they're terrific!

Perfectly crisp on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  I did use 3/4 c. reduced fat peanut butter instead of the 1/2 c. called for.  This will be my trusty standby recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies.  No one can resist :)

These are fabulous! I had quit making peanut butter cookies because mine were so dry and crumbly, but my kids begged me to try again. This recipe was the solution I needed. I made the changes suggested by other reviewers, using 3/4 cup peanut butter, 1/2 to 1 tsp. of vanilla, the stated amount of brown sugar, and half the amount of white sugar. I pressed a bite-sized piece of Hershey milk chocolate bar into the top of each cookie before baking, and they were a big hit.

These are my favorite peanut butter cookies!  I make them with dark brown sugar, regular peanut butter, and Smart Balance spread, and they turn out chewy and perfectly sweet.  Yum!!!

These are pretty good, but sort of blah. If I make them again I'll add vanilla. But other than that they were good. Nice and chewy. =)

I tried these cookies using the tips of others.  I used "real" peanut butter, real butter, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I also placed a chocolate kiss on top of each as soon as they came out of the oven.  My cookies look lovely but are tasteless, dry and not sweet enough(and I generally find desserts TOO sweet!).  Also, they were burning before 10 minutes was up!  Next time I will make them according to the recipe!

These cookies were yummy. The only thing I changed was the PB content, I added a little extra! I also accidetnly used 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (oops), but there was no damage done! Oh also, I didnt bother chilling the dough, didnt need to! Very good cookies.

These were not lowfat but were very greasy in my opinion. I could have used another cup of flour easily. I did use lowfat butter and peanut butter but maybe it's a brand thing. They were chewy but other than that just bland and greasy.

I think these cookies were yummy!  My husband and toddler agrees as well!  I did use margrine, but only because that was all I had.  I use regular Peter Pan Peanut Butter (it's wicked peanutty) and gave it an extra scoop!!!  Dashed some Cinnimon in there for my own lil kick, rolled them up, threw them in a bowl of sugar and they turned out very well!!!  Not flat at all!  I used a stone, turned the temp to 340*, and baked an extra 10 minutes or sooo.  Still chewy on the inside!!!!

Great! I have never mastered peanut butter cookies, they are always too hard or too soft.  These were just right!
