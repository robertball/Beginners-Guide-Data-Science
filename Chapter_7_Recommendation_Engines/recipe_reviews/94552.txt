This wonderful dish got 5 stars from everyone in a very picky family! The flavor was superb and it couldn't have been easier to prepare. I was a little confused on the addition of the curry powder though. The ingredients called for 4 tsps of curry, divided, but it didn't tell where to put the divisions in the recipe. I decided to put 2 tsp in with the rice and 2 tsps in with the butter mixture. Think I must have done it right because it was delish!! Oh, it only took 45 minutes to cook instead of an hour. Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

This is one of the best Indian recipes out there!  You get great Indian flavor but it's easy, and leaves your house smelling wonderful. I agree with the rest of the reviewers who said it only needed 45 minutes to cook.  For the dried fruit I used a mix that I got in the bulk food section of my grocery store--it had raisins, cranberries, dried pineapple and dried mango.  Those fruit flavors were delicious in this dish!

I cut this in half and used two small boneless skinless chicken breasts to serve two. For the dried fruit I used apricots. Wonderful! I will be making this over and over again! Edited to add: I've since found that this is even better with boneless skinless thighs. The thighs are more moist than the breasts.

Chiken was bland the rice was ok. It was not as exotic as I thought it would be. As an improvement to the recipe I will probably add cashews & chicken stock(instead of water) to the rice with dried fruit to accompany spicy curry chicken.

The chicken didn't have much curry flavor, but the rice was amazing.  I used mixed raisins as the dried fruit and it came out delicious.

This is a great dish. Very much like a Thai curry rice dish that is made at a local Thai restaurant. I altered my recipe to be more Thai-like in taste to mimic the restaurant's and turned out perfect. First of all, I browned the chicken in garlic and vegetable oil and curry powders (lots of curry powder as many reviewed the chicken to be bland)- browning all sides. I also used chicken thighs because I love the skin of the chicken. I also used chicken stock instead of water. Added cashews along with a dried raisin/cranberries combo, twice the amount of curry powder indicated and more onions (probably a 1/3 more than indicated) to pack more of a punch. I would also suggest trying pineapple- not even dried one, just the one from the can is terrific. Next time I will try a seafood version of this with scallops, mussels and shrimp. Was delish and tasted SO similar to the restaurant's. A big hit at out home! Thanks so much :)

I did this recipe a little different.  I cooked it as a rice side dish.  First, I melted 2 tablespoons of butter into a skillet and added 1/2 cup onions, then added a small box of rasins after a few minutes and continued cooking and stiring for another minute.  Next, I added one cup of cooked rice mixed ingredients and one more tablespoon of butter.  I mixed it until melted, then added sugar, salt, curry powder paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (for spice).  I continued to cook and stir for a few minutes more.  Recipe turned out great!!

Add more curry!  It's wonderfully moist and the rice is sooo tasty, but it needs more spice.  Also, salt and pepper the chicken before you do anything else to it.  We'll be making this again but adding more oomph.

The recipe should read: "In a 9x13 inch baking pan, mix rice, fruit, onion, sugar, salt, and HALF OF THE CURRY POWDER." We love this recipe! We use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and put peas and raisins in the rice.

This dish had a decent flavor.  I added a quarter of a teaspoon of powdered garlic.  I also used a very mild curry powder.  It really was delicious and easy to prepare.

I gave this a four because the family said it was good but, I haven't tasted it yet. Having leftovers for dinner. Will change my review according to my taste. But, I'm sure I will love it. Additional comment. I thought it was good too so I am changing my rating to five stars. I used chicken broth instead of water.12/10/13-making again. This time Browning breasts in curried butter mix. Yummy!

I gave this a 1 just because you have to rate.  But I would not make this again.  My husband and kids didn't like it and I doubled the recipe thinking to have left overs for dinner too.  If you are not a fan of curry powder don't even try it.

This was an excellent recipe. I improved upon it, however, by doing the following:
In a 3 gallon stock pot (not a 9X13 baking dish), I added the following items, in addition to the original ingredients:
-For the "mixed fruit," I added 6oz. of solely dried cranberries.
-Instead of plain water, I added the equivalent in chicken stock.
-About 1/3cup of Merlot wine.
-Two cups of celery.
-About one cup of sliced, white mushrooms.
-About 4 tablespoons peanut oil.
-One clove of garlic.
For the butter/spice mix I also added:
-About a teaspoon of basil.
-About a teaspoon of oregano.
-About a teaspoon of cinnamon.

The end resulted in a medley of flavors and textures that your palate will demand you make again! I hope others enjoy this edition as much as I did.
Thank you ChristyJ for the original recipe!

Loved! I did double the curry and used chicken stock instead of water. I used 2 tsp hot curry powder and 6 tsp reg curry powder. It was a great compliment to the sweetness of the rice. I not only dressed the chicken with the spice mix I also injected the chicken. If you use brown rice, parboil it for 15 mins before adding the rest of the ingredients. It adds a nice nuttiness to the dish.

This has a lot of potential, but cooking as the recipe states leaves a bit to be desired. The cooking time will always depend on the oven, some cook to hot, others not, and cooking for 45 minutes ended up with perfectly cooked chicken (after letting rest for 6 or 7 minutes under foil on a cutting board). Next, the addition of mixed fruit added some great flavors, but it also can add the taste of preservatives (some people can taste it, like me) and it almost ruins the entire dish. So next time I'm going to avoid the Sunmade Mixed Fruit, because they were the culprits (I also used a pack of Welches Mixed Fruit, and they don't have the foul taste as much). Your safest bet is to use raisins as some people mentioned. Finally, the chicken left a bit to be desired, as it had very little flavor. Next time I may brine it, or use one of the various Tandoori marinades that are on allrecipes.

so so. I tried it with the chicken broth instead and the salt and pepper on the chicken. It wasn't bad but I won't be making it again.

Unbelievably easy to make!  Great recipe- few ingreds, very little effort, great flavor.  This will become a new staple at my house!  Prep time is really more like 5 mins and waiting on the oven to heat.  I used a trail mix with banana chips and nuts I had around.  Didn't bother removing the nuts, and it turned out to be an excellent addition.  I salt and peppered the chicken before brushing heavily with the butter mixture.  Chicken needs a heavy coating of the butter/spice mixture, make extra if needed.

I have a very similar recipe that I've been making quite some time. I figured everyone would love this too...I was wrong. The dried fruit mix I bought for this dish ruined it. It was a 10 oz. expensive box of dried kiwi, strawberries, mango, pineapple, and canteloupe. It took this dish from fab to disaster. I came so close to putting fresh fruit in. I will definitely make again. Next time I will leave out the fruit, and set out small bowls of fresh pineapple, raisins, apple, banana, sunflower seeds, coconut, and maybe chutney. That way everyone can dish it out themselves how the want it. Great recipe though! Just my stupidity on thinking expensive dried fruit might be better.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  We found it very dry.   I love curry so the next time I try it I will make more sauce and pour it over the chicken before baking.

My husband's not a fan of curry and this didn't convert him, but he did enjoy it as much as he could - he even ate leftovers!  I used brown rice and it could have been cooked longer, but I thought it was great!

I would recommend cooking this as two dishes: the chicken in one and the rice in the other. I cooked mine for an hr, took the chicken out, then cooked the rice some more. The chicken was dry and not very flavorful. The rice was ok (after I added garlic power, chick stock, red bell peppers, and some minced serranos). I would think browning the chicken first on the stove and then letting in simmer would yield more flavor and better control over how/if it needs more seasoning

This was delicious. I did, however, add a bit more spice for personal preference. I used chicken broth instead of water, but I would use a little less next time because my rice was just a bit more moist than I would have liked. The cooking time was perfect though. The chicken was very tender. A snap to clean up, too.

The chicken was very moist! The sweetness of the fruit complemented well with the curry. Everyone at dinner enjoyed it. We used chicken thighs, and the skin had great flavor from the curry.

My husband and I loved how moist the chicken was, and he liked the fact that it wasn't in your face curry flavor. The rice didn't wow, on the other hand. I found it a little less than cooked and lacking in a strong flavor of any kind.

This is a wonderful dish for guests or dinner for your family.  I added a little mango chutney and some brown sugar to the melted butter and spices.  Served it with Tzatziki and more mango chutney on the side.  I will make this again....very nice dish for entertaining.

Great dish and easy to throw together. Just use less water if you dont like mushy rice. Chicken has its own juices so there is no need for 2 cups of water. Try 1 1/2 cups of water or take the foil off 20 min before completion.

This was the best dish I've found so far!  It was so easy to make and most ingredients were on hand.  The only changes I made was using boneless skinless chicken thighs and 1/2 tsp onion powder in place of fresh onion since husband does like onions.

This dish was excellent! I had to add 1/2 cup more water to the dish because currently staying in a high altitude region, also I added a dash of nutmeg, cinnimon, and a dash of lemon pwder. to increase the smell and taste of this wonderful dish !! We Love it!

This was a hit with the boyfriend. I don't like fruit in my curry so I left that out, but next time i'll add some veggies, some peppers, etc.   It was really yummy and truly easy!

The rice was great, just make sure you use the correct amount of liquids.  Mine came out a bit undercooked.   The butters/spice spread on the chicken needs to be under the skin, otherwise there will be no taste.  I would go as far as marinating it before hand.    Overall, I wouldn't repeat this one, but it was a good quick recipe.

The best thing about this recipe is that it is so easy to make - throw in oven and leave!  I added green & red peppers, tomato and spinach.  It was ok - smelled better than it tasted but kids ate it up fine.

Excellent! I used raisins and apricots in the rice.  Will definitely make again. I did brown the chicken before laying it over the rice and then used the pan to add butter and spices which I poured over the chicken.  Very easy!!

This is a very colorful and fragrant dish...and very easy to make too! I use Jasmine rice instead of long grain, substitute 1 can of chicken broth for the water, and choose dried tropical fruit. I also prefer using shrimp from time to time. They just get added to the rice halfway through the baking time. Oh, and Hot Madras Curry powder for those that like a bit more spice!

I love this  one pan dish and I made some adjustments. I substituted the fruit for a box of frozen spinach and omitted the sugar. I also added some chili powder to make the chicken spicy. It was delicious!

I used chicken broth instead of water and used a combination of mixed raisins and currents to make up the 6oz of dried fruit, otherwise I followed this exactly.... Delicious! Even my picky kids liked it :)

I followed some other suggestions and cut up 4 small chicken breasts sprinkled them with 1 tsp of curry powder and browned them in oil and minced garlic for a couple of minutes. I also added some chicken bouillon to the water and put some canned crushed pineapple on top of the rice instead of the dried fruit. It was delicious but only served 3 people, next time I would add at least another 1/2 cup of rice and another cup of chicken broth. It was delicious and will make again!

My family is not into new things, but this dish is great. We used apricots as the dried fruit; we found them to be too sweet but a great place to start.

Excellent dish! The instructions were a little off - the curry powder was supposed to be divided, but it didn't say divided on what. So, I took the liberty to first double the amount of rice, use thighs instead and sprinkled about 1 tsp of curry powder on the rice. It made the rice look a very pretty yellow! I would probably double that next time and use chicken broth instead of water. Overall a tasty and very pretty dish.

This was a great easy meal! I added a sliced rib of celery to the rice/onion mixture. In the last 5 minutes I added 1 green apple chopped. I doubled the rice and it was fabulous! Any recipe is a winner to me if the kids and hubby request it again, which they did! Enjoy!

This is sooo good.  I give it four stars only though, because if you cook the chicken according to the directions, it turns out too tough.  I cooked this tonight, but put the chicken in the crock pot with some butter and curry for about 2 hours first.  Then I laid it on the rice and cooked according to the instructions.  Me and my husband love this!

This was a great recipe. I had to cut the ingredients in half, all except the rice mixture as I was using 2 boneless breasts, I cut these into strips and placed them on top like it called for.  This was a wow dish and will definitely use this again. Am already giving out the recipe. Only one problem, divide the curry powder and do whaat with it. I used half of it in the rice mixture, suppose that was the only place to divide it to.

I followed the recipe with little exception. I cut the fruit in 1/2 due to hubby's protests. I used golden rasins and cherries. Maybe my curry powder was old but this dish was just ok. I did mix everything together well also. I found that 45 minutes coked the chicken well but the rice was totally soggy and mushy  textured. I found pockets of spice and lots of pockets of blandness. I did as a previous writer suggested by putting 1/2 the curry in the rice mixture and 1/2 in the butter with a 1/4 tsp of cardamom. I won't be making this again.

This was fantastic--very authentic tasting. If you feel like Indian food, save yourself money and just eat this at home!  :)   My husband loved it, and even my two year old son loved the fruit in the rice (the chicken was too spicy for him so I left the curry sauce off his piece).  THANK YOU for this recipe!

I did this recipe really different.  I decided to just make the rice and forget about the chicken.  I did not put the rice in the over either.  What I did was I took 2 cups of uncooked rice and added the water in it.  In the water I put the teaspoon of onion powder, 4 teaspoons of Curry powder and ½ teaspoon of paprika and a teaspoon of olive oil.  Mixed it up and let it cook.  My husband is half Indian and he loved the rice.  He asked of is again just this weekend.

Good for a quick dinner-we loved the fruity rice.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts and cut the curry powder back to 2 teaspoons so the flavor wouldn't be too overpowering.  Baking these for 40 minutes was plenty.

Personally, I hate chicken and fruit together, but my dad liked this recipe. I used raisins and dried cranberries for the dried fruit. I just really didn't like this at all but if you like fruity chicken, then you might want to try it.

It's a good idea, baking rice with the chicken this way, but this recipe was quite bland and plain.  It definately needs more seasoning and not just heat.  I will be making this again, but I think I'll use my favorite seasonings with it (maybe cajun, or dry salad dressing mix) in the rice and on the chicken.

This was absolutely delish. I followed the entire recipe but I did add some minced garlic, cinnamon, and bay leaves. I also did rub the butter mixture onto the chicken. I used wings. The rice was terrific. I served it for dinner this evening and my entire family loved it. My mother in law asked for the recipe before she left and plans on making this dish next Sunday.

My wife said this tasted much like the Indian food she ate when in London...high praise for the recipe.  Maybe it's an exaggeration, but it was very good.

I also found as someone else mentioned that the chicken was a little on the bland side, if I were to make it again I think perhaps it would be best to rub the chicken and leave for the spice to permeate. I myself and DH really liked the rice and I liked the addition of the fruit (although DH said hold it on the fruit - he has a choc bar and fizzy drink for breakfast so no need to take his advise) my only moan, I am on a roll, why stop now? That a little more rice is required for our family at least another 1/4 cup.
