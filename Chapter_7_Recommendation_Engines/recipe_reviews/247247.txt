Very tasty & hearty!  I used diced canned tomatoes with juice & added about a 1/4 cup of dry white wine.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!  The chopped parsley added a bit of freshness that was wonderful.  Will definitely make it again.

I used canned whole peeled tomatoes and fresh cherry tomatoes.   I used the veggie stock to prepare orzo instead of polenta, my husbands favorite.
