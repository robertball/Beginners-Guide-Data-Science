I thought it was great. I made 48 little tarts. One suggestion, don't let Jello thicken, add it to condensed milk mixture when it is room temperature.  You don't want to risk having lumps of green Jello in your pie.

This is an excellent no-bake key-lime pie.  I especially like the smooth texture.  The blend of the milk with sour cream and gelatin gives it a very "summery" cool taste. The only thing I would do is to leave out the lime zest; it doesn't go well with the smooth texture.  Even still, I will make this again.  Oh one more thing, I used a pre-made graham cracker crust, as that's what I prefer with key-lime.

This was awesome.  However, everywhere it said lime, I substituted lemon.  I made the best lemon cream pie!
This recipe is super super easy.

I did not like the sour cream in this recipe and it wasn't very rich or satisfying.

Great recipe. Have made this for six years and have always had great reviews. Only things;  I don't add good coloring, as it doesn't need it and I add an extra teaspoon of grated lime rind, as it makes it taste more authentic.
