This is a great recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving, our office Christmas party and will make it for our family Christmas dinner. I only use fresh sweet potatoes as I don't care for canned. Also, I don't like to boil potatoes (loses flavor) so what I do is wash about 4 sweet potatoes (leaving skins on), wrap them in aluminum foil and bake them in the oven at 450 degrees for about an hour or until soft. Let them cool, unwrap foil and then cut in half and the skins easily slip off. If you have the time, this is A LOT easier then peeling and cutting sweet potatoes to boil (don't know about you all, but sometimes trying to cut through a raw sweet potato is pretty difficult!!). Anyway, then I follow the recipe from there. Yum! I always get rave reviews. Thanks again for this great recipe!

good! it is sweet but not overpowering.  i used about 2 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes to get the 4 cups mashed.  i made in 2 6 x 8 disposable pans and froze one after  baking, without the topping.  it reheated very well.  also, i added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the added flavor.  definitely a keeper!

I doubled this recipe and cut back a little on the sugar, as others mentioned, and it turned out perfectly.  Also, as someone mentioned, 2.5 lbs. of sweet potatoes equals 4 cups mashed.  I baked my sweet potatoes whole for about an hour, then scooped out the filling and mashed, topped and baked.  The topping was delicious and I got many compliments.  Thanks!

I didn't make the topping, and I did cut back on the sugar in the casserole (I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar).  This was EXCELLENT! Definitely the best sweet potato casserole I've ever had.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for the first time, and brought it to work today.  Everyone loved it.  I'm glad I read the recommendations to reduce the sugar, because it would have been much too sweet otherwise.  I made it with 8 cups of baked mashed yams instead of sweet potatoes, reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, used 1 stick of butter, and added cinnamon & nutmeg to taste.  For the topping I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup, and used 1 stick of butter.  I made the yams last night, and kept them in the fridge, then this morning I covered them with the topping, and baked.  All my co-workers asked for the recipe!

Delicious! I cut the sugar in both the potatoes and the topping in half because we don't like it to be so sweet. We loved this!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make.  I did use about 1/2 of the amount of sugar it called for.  I did add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg when I made the topping.  Added a great flavor. Will add this to my recipe box for sure.  My husband enjoy it and he is not a "casserole" person! Thanks!

I've made this many times for many different people and it has always been a big hit at the holiday events.  

There have been times where I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh to save time.  When I do this I omit the sugar from the potatoe portion of the recipe (the syrup in the can makes it sweet enough) and I strain the potatoes out of their syrup.  Nobody could tell I used canned sweet potatoes and it was loved by everyone.  

I cut the topping portion in half (I always had extra left when I made a full batch) and put everything in a round casarole dish and that seems to be a good amount for a family event.

OK, this is even BETTER than my wonderful mother-in-law's version of Sweet Potato Casserole!  I use two 15oz. cans of sweet potatoes (mashed) or 4 medium sweet potatoes, baked in microwave.  Reduce sugar by HALF in casserole AND in topping.  Add 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. cinnamon to casserole.  Bake in 2qt. round baking dish.  I like this pecan/brown sugar topping SO MUCH BETTER than marshmallow topping!!  It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it!

I needed a new sweet potato recipe for our Thanksgiving (tired of marshmallows) and chose this one because it was one of the few that called for a little salt (which made me trust its creator more). My Very Picky Nephew said it was "awesome" and even my hard to please Mother said it was a "keeper."  I changed it only just a bit - I cut the white sugar in with 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 maple syrup; added nutmeg and an extra tsp vanilla; used evaporated rather than regular milk and increased the amount til it reached the consistency that *I* prefer; and whipped it til it was fluffy (catering to my mom's tastes - I would've been happy with it mashed, too).  It is officially now a part of our traditional holiday menu.

Incredible!  First time making sweet potato casserole, and what a huge hit!  With that said, I did not add any sugar to the sweet potato mixture, and added only one egg instead of two (otherwise, without the sugar, two eggs may have been to "eggy").  Roasted the potatoes in a 400 F oven for about an hour (first rub with oil and poke holes in it, and cover loosely with foil on a baking sheet). For the nutty topping, I used walnuts because I did not have pecans, and I only added 1 TB of brown sugar.  It was perfect as a "savory-ish" sweet potato casserole, and just what we prefer.  Thank you for the base recipe.. it's going in my recipe binder forever! :)

A family favorite any time we have turkey.
I always use fresh cooked sweet potatos instead of canned, and make more topping than called for since we love the topping.
I make my topping gluten free by using rice flour insted of all purpose flour for the topping, and it tastes the same.

My uncle has been making this dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas for the last few years.  I personally dont care for yams/sweet potatoes, but after tasting this creation - I'm a yam fan (at least when they are made this way)!  With the sweet potatoes smoothe as silk and the sugar/nut topping for a nice contrast in textures, it became a family favorite for holidays.  Make it and your family with fight over the last spoonful!

Made this exactly as described, except added fresh grated nutmeg and some cinnamon to the potatoes for spice.  I even scaled it up for 15 servings and it still fit nicely into a black Glad serving pan for easy travel.  
Because some in my in-law household don't like pecans, I took a suggestion from another recipe and substituted corn flakes in the topping for 2/3 of the top  of the casserole.  Both the pecans and the corn flakes were sweet and crunchy/even a little chewy which was AWESOME, and they stayed that way underneath the marshmallows my husband insisted I put on top to broil at the end.
Such a great, easy recipe.
Suggestion for sweet potatoes:  I peel them and cut into pieces if I have time, then steam them over my large pasta pot.  They cook in 20 minutes while you're getting everything else together and they are so moist and soft when you mash them because of the steaming.  This works leaving them peeled and whole as well, just takes a little more time.

I love this recipe! It is always a hit every time I make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I actually make it with gluten free baking mix instead of flour because I'm allergic to gluten. You can't tell the difference. I do cut down the white sugar and brown sugar a little bit. It's delicious!!

excellent!! I don't normally like sweet potato casseroles, but my husband insisted for christmas I make some. This was simple and delicious. The only change I made was adding a small amount of pumpkin pie spice to the potatoes as someone else recommended. I will absolutely make this again!

In error, I added the topping the last 5-10 minutes of cooking and it turned out fantastic. I don't think I would cook the topping the whole time the potatoes are cooking. I think it would have been over-cooked. This is a keeper! My mother-in-law wants to use it for her christmas dinner now!

I made this for Christmas dinner at a friends - we could have nuts due to allergies, but everything else was just as the recipe stated. It was DELICIOUS - most everyone took seconds and several asked for the recipe.  It was very sweet but a great side for turkey and stuffing!

This is exactly the taste I was looking for.  I did not make the topping, since my kids don't like nuts.  I baked it with out the topping for 10 minutes, then added mini marshmallows and continued baking for 30 more minutes.  It was perfect!

Amazing recipe.  Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone kept going back for more.  I baked the sweet potatoes the night before and then peeled off the skins when ready to make the casserole and mashed.  Don't buy canned!  Use the real thing...makes a huge difference.  A new family favorite...making it for Christmas, too.  The topping is to die for!

I made this for my husband to take to his office Thanksgiving lunch yesterday and he said it was the highlight of the meal...everyone LOVED it!  Needless to say I'll be making it again for our family meal and for many years to come.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will now be a family tradition.  (I did as other suggested and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup but did everything else as written....YUM!)

I make a sweet potato casserole like this every Thansgiving, with two small changes.  I use 1/2 C. flaked coconut in the topping, and I add a tsp. of grated orange zest to the sweet potato filling. Out-of-this-world additions.

This was the first time I have ever made a sweet potato casserole and my family loved it.  Even some of the people who don't like sweet potatoes tried it and liked it - said it tasted like dessert.  I made the sweet potato part the night before and put it in the fridge and then on Thanksgiving I put on the crumb topping and baked it.

I don't think 5 stars is enough... this was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!! I made it exactly as directed, with one exception... at the end of the baking time i cranked up the oven to 400, moved it to the top rack and let it brown till sizzling... made the topping deliciously crunchy. it was to die for !!!!!!

FANTASTIC!! I just made it to take to a family gathering and had to stop myself from eating a big helping!  It tastes more like dessert than a side dish!! If you don't like sweet things, I would cut down on the white sugar. It's wonderful and rich!!  Sure to please everyone like likes sweet potatoes!

This is a great dish.  We are gluten and dairy free.  We use Almond milk and a butter substitute instead of regular milk and butter.  We also use brown sugar instead of the white sugar.  Everyone in the family loves this dish.  It is now a regular in our house!!

Even the pickiest kids who swear off veggies go for seconds on this. It's a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Th topping is sweet enough to cut the sugar in the sweet potatoes down to 3/4. If you want a bit more classical sweet potato dish, you can definitely get away with even 1/2 cup.

I loved this recipe. I changed it a little to adjust to my personal style of cooking and taste. I boiled the potatoes in a little bit of water, butter, sugar and vanilla. As they cook more water will be produced by the potatoes. I mashed the potatoes and added more sugar and some of the water from the boiled. I only added one egg and the 1/3 milk. For the topping I used the remaining water from the boiled added the flour and pecans. Stirred untl thick. Added the mixture to the mash, baked for 30 mins, added marshmallows and baked for another 15 minutes and YUMM!

Very tasty and easy. I used 3/4 cup of sugar, but next time i'll probably use only 1/2 as this is really sweet. Bake potatoes in the oven first, skin comes off nicely and no peeling required.

Loved it.  We added a touch of cinnamon and cut the recipe for 4 people.  We bought the cubed peeled sweet potatoes in a bag in the produce section of Wal-mart and you can actually cook those IN the BAG IN the MICROWAVE in 5 minutes with no mess.  That saves the vitamins too.

Have made this twice - last year for Thanksgiving and this year for Christmas.  Delicious and a big hit with my family! I halve the potatoes, etc. (use can sweet potatoes) and bake in 9x9 but use almost a full recipe of the topping. Very easy to make.

Ok, every year I try a new sweet potato recipe for thanksgiving and they are all pretty much the same... But I must say, this was the best one yet.  It's the topping that made it.  Thank you so much!  I am making this again for Christmas!

I don't like sweet potatoes, but, I tried this and liked it a lot. It was easy to make and I put it in an 8 x 8 pan in my toaster oven. Making it at Thanksgiving and Christmas yearly. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy and delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving trial run with friends and it was a HUGE hit.  I took the advise of others and baked the potatoes (4 large sweet potatoes baked for an hour).  Then I squeezed them out of the skins and mixed the other stuff in. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger and omitted the salt.  I did not double the topping as others have suggested.  I can see how people would like that because the topping delicious.  However, by not doubling it, it was a pleasant surprise when you got a bite of the topping without being overly sweet. I will make again for sure!

Delish! I would reduce the sugar, and use only 2/3rds of what the recipe calls for though. Very tastey I will make again and again!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving! The only thing I changed was to add 2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping. The crunchy topping is awesome, reminded me a bit of apple crisp. This was so good my kids wanted more for dessert instead of pumpkin pie. Will definitely make again.

My favorite part of Thanksgiving! This year I doubled the potatoes and left everything else the same - turned out great. One of our guests thought it was dessert and had three helpings!!

This recipe was relatively simple but a had a great outcome. My family doesn't like overly sweet foods so I just added an extra potato and that seemed to balance it out a little. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. For the topping I used dark brown sugar, since it was all I had on hand, and it was very good.

I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes - until I had this!  In fact it is so good that everyone had seconds.   I cut the white sugar just a little and it was still plenty sweet enough. Very easy to make and presents nicely! Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious ... I did cut the white sugar in half (still plenty of sweetner), with the rest of the recipe "as is".  It paired well with the turkey and the other side dishes to help create a fantastic meal.  Thanks!

I've been making this for years. I substitute egg beaters for the eggs and use Splenda for the sugars. It turns out just as sweet, like a dessert, but cuts calories.

Delicious! I baked my sweet potatoes before I mashed them - I find the flavour is better than boiling. I also halved the recipe and left out the topping. I served it with a roast chicken and some salad and it was absolutely perfect! My boyfriend doesn't even like sweet potatoes and he ate this. Thanks for the recipe.

I brought this to a pre-thanksgiving potluck at work and it was very well received. It tastes great warm or cold. My hausband ate it cold w whipped cream...I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and I just about doubled the topping and it was perfect..you can use a little less brown sugar too, about 3/4 cup, and 3/4 cup pecans will do it..unless you like more...also drizzled 3-4 tsps of maple syrup on top..makes it sweeter and had a nice taste!

Here's what I did to make this a 5 star recipe that everyone raved about:

- Bake fresh sweet potatoes, wrapped in foil, at 450F for one hour.
- Halved the sugar (used only 1/2 cup)
- Added 1/2 cup maple (not pancake!) syrup
- Used only about 1/2-2/3 of the topping on a 9x13" dish.  Using the whole amount lays it on too thick.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving and the topping was very good but the potatoes lacked in flavor and consistency. If I make them again I would add all dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and a good shot of maple syrup.

I made marshmallow topped sweet potatoes last year and I thought it was good..until I made this potato casserole!  The brown sugar topping with pecans was absolutely amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing!  This recipe is good as a side dish or as dessert! It wasn't too sweet but hit the spot!

This was a -big- hit at Thanksgiving.  We usually have candied sweet potatoes, and this was every bit as sweet.  Everyone who tried it loved it... although we thought that the topping should have been half flour and half brown sugar, and will probably make that change next year.  But we'll definitely be making it next year too!

Truly the BEST! To be honest, I thought it would be TOO sweet - but it's perfect.  Really compliments my au gratin potatoes and cranberry sauce.  MAKE SURE TO USE FRESH SWEET POTATOES rather than canned - it's 10x better.  Bake it for about 1 1/2 hours, and the skin comes right off.

Excellent! I made this for Thanksgiving last year and couldn't believe the reception it got! Everyone absolutely LOVED it. Even my oldest brother who is the pickiest critic on the planet who doesn't even like sweet potatoes!! The first thing everyone asked me this year was, "Are you going to make that sweet potato casserole again?" It is going to be a staple at every Thanksgiving from here on out!!

Holy cow, can you say SWEET? I halved the sugar called for in the sweet potato mix but it was still waaaayyyy too much for my taste. Even Husband, who is a huge SPC fan, said it was a little too much. Still plan on making this for Thanksgiving dinner but will use a third of a cup of sugar (half white, half brown.) Think I might also use half pecans, half walnuts for the topping. Giving it three stars instead of two as my 18 month old absolutely LOVED it, and he's going through a pretty picky stage at the moment.

I absolutely love this recipe! So scrumptious! I do the casserole recipe as it says, but instead of the topping I melt mini marshmallows on the top! Amazing recipe!

This is now our family favorite.  I opt'd. for changing the 1 cup of white sugar for 1/2 white and 1/2 brown but no other changes

Fabulous! My husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes raved about it. He even called his sister across the country to tell her about it! 
I did cut the sugar amount down just a bit and will cut even mor down next time. The topping adds a very nice crunch. Very easy for anyone to make !

My family loves this.  We make it on all the holidays and even just for the fun of it.  I have family and friends who say they hate sweet potatoes and I have had them try this and they love it.  Can't believe that it is made with sweet potatoes.  It will be a family favorite for many years to come.

I made this a week ahead for Thanksgiving - I roasted my sweet potatoes, then peeled and mashed them with the eggs, sugar, half-n-half, butter, and spices (I added ginger and allspice).  I made the topping, then froze the whole thing.  The night before I took it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge - then put it in the oven on the day I served it.  My teenage daughter was disappointed that I didn't use marshmallows ... but she came back for seconds!  We has 12 at our house and no leftovers!

Delicious recipe. I've made it numerous times and friends ask for it again and again. It's great re-heated, too.  Only sub was using chopped walnuts instead of pecans.

Made this for Thanksgiving and my BF said it was as good as his mothers and he is an extremely picky eater. Listened to other reviews and only added half a cup of sugar in the sweet potatoe mixture and used 3 medium sweet potatoes and 3 medium yams. Only put crumbled brown sugar on top because my son is allergic to all nuts, but is was all gone by the next day.

I made this for this past Thanksgiving and it was a huge success with my family! I don't particularly like sweet potatoes (unless it's a pie) but everyone had seconds and raved about it. I did sprinkle a few marshmallows on the top for the last 10 minutes of baking or so, just so it'd be kind of gooey. I'll definitely be making again next year!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Based on the other reviews here, I cut in half the sugar for both the casserole and the streusel topping and it came out perfectly.  I baked my sweet potatoes wrapped in foil at 400 until they were soft, then used the mixer to mash them.  Fortunately, the fibrous tough stringy stuff from the potatoes wrapped around the mixer blade so it was easy to discard.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum, this casserole was excellent!  We served it for Thanksgiving to my husband's parents and our friends here in Finland (I'm an American living abroad), and everyone loved it!  My mother-in-law said I must make it for Christmas at their place :)   I made a couple of modifications: 1. Sugar mixed into the sweet potatoes reduced to 1/2 Cup, and used brown sugar, not white. 2. Sugar in topping reduced to 1/2 Cup  3. Omitted flour - instead used corn flakes 4. Copied some other recipes and added mini marshmallows to the top.   Delicious!  I'm sure it would also be just fine adhering strictly to the recipe.

Made as directed  using 1 large can of sweet potatoes; these were very good, although super sweet. I would cut back on the topping next time (maybe do half). Everyone liked them, though.

This turned out great.  My only addition was stirring a few red hots into the casserole before adding the topping - sounds weird but adds a nice crunch and cinnamon taste.  Thanks for my new favorite sweet potato casserole!

Everyone's favorite dish at Thanksgiving.  It was sweeter than pumpkin pie so I reduced the sugar on the second batch.   I used one can of drained yams and used my electric mixer to mash them a little bit.  I used a smaller square baking dish. Keeping 4 or 5 whole pecans and  placing them like a flower in the center before baking makes it look nice.

I fixed this recipe with no alterations for a potluck at my husband's workplace and a potluck at our church. The entire dish was consumed at both places, and several people were raving about it and asking for the recipe! This is most certainly going to become a holiday classic around our house. Thank you so much!

I forgot my melted butter in the microwave and this still turned out great.  You won't even notice it's missing.

Made it for a party last night. Everyone loved it. My sister said I made her like sweet potatoes for the first time ever. I did not use the topping, just sprinkled some brown sugar and some marshmallows on top. Was excellent. Followed the rest of the recipe as written.

My family loves this recipe! It really does taste more like a dessert than a vegetable. I usually add marshmallows to the topping with about 10 minutes left in the oven. Even the youngest kids in the family ask for seconds of this yummy dish!

This is a great recipe.  I did omit the topping, due to folks in my house not liking pecans(how dare they) I replaced it with mini marshmallows.  I also added cinnamon in the mix.  It was awesome!!!

Thank you for a great recipe, I reminded me of my Mom's

I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes but I saw a recipe similar to this one on a TV show and it looked so good that I thought I would give it a try. It turned out very good and I even overheard a comment that it was "amazing."

Here's the couple little changes I made. I peeled and diced the potatoes and baked them in a pan covered with foil. When they were soft I mashed them and added the milk - oh, I used evaporated milk. I added a dash of pumpkin pie spice - maybe 1/2 tsp or a little more. In the topping I added about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. 

I made a second batch with Splenda to cut down on the sugar for the few diabetics that were at our Thanksgiving party and the ones made with the Splenda were just as good. In the Splenda batch I only used about 3/4 cups sugar in the potatoes but the same amount of brown sugar Splenda for the topping.

I thought this was just OK.  Wondered if people are confusing sweet potatoes with yams.  I believe it would be great with yams, without adding all the sugar and butter.  I believe the texture might be better without mashing it.  I like the topping and will spend some time experimenting with yams to make it 5 star for me.

I make this for the holidays every year and my daughter usually makes it to take to annual Christmas lunch at work.  It never fails to get compliments.  This is not your typical sweet potato casserole - it's very sweet and more like a dessert.

Big hit at Thanksgiving.  I cut down the amount of white sugar to about 1/3 and felt the sweet potato mixture was just right with the sweet, crunchy topping.  Guests asked for the recipe!

This was a really good casserole Connie.  I made just a few changes...using all brown sugar and walnuts instead of pecans.  I also used a combination of regular sweet potatoes and Korean sweet potatoes, which are white instead of orange.  To the sweet potato mixture I added about an 1/8 cup of orange juice, just for a little added flavor and left out the vanilla since I was out.  Thanks for sharing...Happy Holidays to all.

This was a very good dish, like a dessert. I added mini marshmallows on top of the pecan topping and baked for 42 minutes. The marshmallows browned on top and was a little crunchy, it complimented the pecan topping well. Excellent!! :)

I would rate this a full 5 stars except I did change the recipe to my liking.  I omitted the sugar in the sweet potato mash portion of the recipe and cut back on the amount of brown sugar (about half the recommended amount) in the topping.  Doing this resulted in the perfect degree of sweetness for me!  My guests have raved about the casserole also!

These are by far the best sweet potatoes I have ever had.  I've made this every Thanksgiving for years & finally got around to reviewing it.  This is like a delicious crustless pie.  I've shared the recipe countless times.  It's always a big hit.  No changes needed!  I boil the potatoes in their skins, until they're tender.  Drain the potatoes & let cool a bit.  Then you can slide the jackets right off & mash the potatoes.  Don't buy canned potatoes!  Start with fresh & you'll be much happier.

This recipe was way too sweet!  Next time I will cut back on the sugar because it was too sweet to take more than a couple bites.

Great recipe! 
I've made it several times. The only thing I changed is that I left the milk out all together because it turns out very thin and soupy with it added.

This recipe was so delicious! I usually prefer sweet potatoes just whole with butter and nothing sugary sweet, but decided to try a casserole for Thanksgiving this year. I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes, cut the sugar in half in both the casserole and the topping, and kept everything else the same. Perfect! Not dessert-y sweet and the nuts gave it a great texture. It was a huge hit and will be added into the Thanksgiving menu from here on out!

My family, especially my sister loves this recipe. I took it to my sister's house for Thanksgiving and it was voted the best Sweet Potato casserole they'd ever eaten. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used about 6 cups of potatoes. I also went a little heavy on the pecans for the topping and was short on the brown sugar so I only used 2/3 of a cup. Glad that happened, the topping was perfect with the extra brown sugar left out.

Great recipe!  TIP: you can make the topping as instructed, or instead of melting the butter you can soften it a little and cut it into the flour/sugar/nut mix.  This will make the topping "crumble".  Melting the butter is good too, it is just harder to apply as topping.

awesome.  my 11 year old ate a whole bowl of the mashed potatoes for breakfast before i even got it completely assembled in the baking pan with the topping!  since so many people said 1 cup sugar was too sweet, i used 1/3 cup white, 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup maple syrup.  i also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and only used 1 egg.  for the topping i substituted 1/2 cup shredded coconut for the pecans and used 2/3 cup melted butter instead of 1/3 to make it more "crumblier."  i put mini-marshmallows over the topping on half of it, since the kids love them.

I am pretty much in love with this recipe. (: I made a few changes, but only for my preferences (I'm trying to watch my waist line). I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup Truvia baking blend, 3 egg whites, skim milk, Light I can't Believe It's Not Butter. Also, I did without the topping. STILL AMAZING. I think if I were to do the topping I would do 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup Truvia, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and Light ICBINB with the chopped pecans. Thank you!

I made this for Thanks giving Dinner to bring as a side dish for our get together. My husband does not like sweet potatoes but he liked this dish, so did everyone else. I did not really care for the topping but the potatoes were wonderful. I followed some suggestions form a few viewers and I only used 1/3 of a cup of sugar and I baked the potatoes instead of boiling. I really think that made the potatoes so creamy. I will make this dish again with out the pecan topping.

I meant to reduce the amount of sugar based on reviews, but I forgot.  It was very sweet but was a huge hit nevertheless.  Good recipe!

Quick & easy to make.  I had three sweet potatoes that I decided I didn't want to just bake.  Found this recipe and because the three potatoes didn't quite make four cups of mashed potatoes, more like three, I cut down on the amt of ingredients.  I only used half the sugar, which I would have also done had I had enough potatoes.  I used only one egg, and halved the rest of the ingredients except for vanilla extract, which I almost doubled and put in extra pecans because I love 'em!  My mother doesn't give out compliments easily and she loved the dish as did my husband.  I'll make this again!

Wow! I goofed on this recipe when I added a bit too much liquid, so I threw in a 1/4 cup of flour to soak it up. After the casserole was baked it was still absolutely delicious. I think I might throw in some nutmeg next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving - it is really very good. Note that you have to watch the size of the sweet potatoes, I wasn't thinking and boiled smaller ones. Had to start over with larger sweet potatoes to get the 4 cups.  My modificaitons: I added about 3/4 cup more potatoes, coconut (about 1/3 bag) and crushed pecans to the mix.  Didn't use all of the topping.  It was perfect.

Suggestions:
-Add some pecans to the potato mixture.
-Use a large plastic baggie to mix the topping...it's much easier to combine the ingredients this way!

I use this recipe every holiday!

This is a great dish to go with ham at church functions. I do use less sugar if I use canned SweetPotatoes and I also add 1/8 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.

I did reduce the sugar a bit.  DH said to give this five stars so I went with his vote.  It was a little too sweet for me... but I think that's how most people like their sweet potatoes!

Wow. This is the best-tasting sweet potato recipe I've had in a long time (and I have an infatuation with sweet potatoes!).  Next time, though, I don't think I'll add butter to the mashed sweet potatoes.  They don't need it, it just made it kinda greasy.  The milk and sugar are enough.

I have never made sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving in my entire life, until this year. My boyfriend wanted some kind of sweet potato side dish, so I pulled up my trusty Allrecipes link and found this one. I *highly* recommend this recipe. The potatoes were awesome and were the hit of the entire dinner! They are so sweet and creamy smooth, it was almost like eating dessert instead of a side dish. I mixed up the potatoes and put them in the slowcooker on low heat while the turkey was roasting, about 6 or 7 hours. When the turkey was done, I topped the potatoes with the brown sugar/pecan topping and put the crock in the oven to finish it off - 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Every person at the table asked for a little doggy bag to take with them (and I had plenty to give away, since I doubled the recipe). I might cut back on the amount of sugar used next time I make this recipe because it was so sweet.

I used brown sugar instead of white for the sweet potatoes and, didn't put the pecan topping on.  Instead, used a half bag of mini marshmallows because my kids prefer that.  Came out so wonderful!  My mother-in-law loved it because she could taste the toasted marshmallows which definitely gave it a wonderful flavor!

Just got back from Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE loved this recipe. I used a 2.5 lb can of sweet potatoes, drained and rinsed and mashed them with 2 boiled fresh sweet potatoes. I cut the white sugar to 1/2 a cup. Everything else I followed exactly. So good and fairly simple. I will make this again next year. Thanks for the recipe!

Used yams instead of sweet potatoes.this got good reviews from everyone at the Thanksgiving table. Cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and I still found it too sweet. Will do 1/4 next time. Cut back on the brown sugar in the topping also to 1/2 cup.

I was disappointed by my family's reaction to this dish at Thanksgiving.  I thought it was great, but most of my family only ate a couple of bites.  I used baked sweet potatoes.  My mom said that she makes this recipe using canned yams, and she likes it better that way.  Maybe I'll try that next time.  My husband said he liked it, but it was too sweet for him to be able to eat more than a couple of bites.

Excellent recipe! I've made variations of this before, but this was definitely the best so far...not overwhelmingly sweet, good texture, delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and made in a 9 x 9 dish.

Loved the topping.  Some might think it's too sweet, but my guests and I thought it was a nice change to the usual marshmallow topping.  I would add more pecans next time.  I forgot to add the milk, and it still tasted great.  Will make again!

I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit. Even my husband who hates sweet potatoes tried it adn really liked it, he even had more the next day! the only change i made was i used rice milk, my son is allergic to milk soy eggs, and I used egg replacer, no one could tell the difference, my sons ate it up. Everyone loved it so much i had to print out the recipes for them. I have a few christmas parties to go to and will be definalty makeing this. i will even make some for the special needs kids i work with to try it and see if they want to make it for thier thanksgiving feast they put on for staff next year. I woudl definatly recommed this to anyone who wants to impress others. I made it the day before coked it for 30 minutes then put in fridge and the next day i put in oven for 15 minutes and it was awesome.

This is delicious but very very sweet.  I took the advice of another user and wrapped the potatoes in foil and then baked them at 450 for 50 minutes.  You would not believe how simple this method is.  It sure beat having to peal, but and boil!  Even my picky kids gobbled this one up (probably b/c it takes like candy).  MMMMM so good.  Thanks for sharing!

Wayyyyyy to sweet for me.  I have never tried canned sweet potatoes before and won't do it again.  Fresh is much better.  A bit too much brown sugar in this.

I’ve made sweet potato pie before and it turned out good. Never tried sweet potato casserole until this recipe. Listening to the comments of cutting back the sugar, I did too. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. This was a big hit, all gone and talked about a lot. I used fresh potatoes, pricked with a fork, baked them 70 mins, when cool, the skins come right off. I used 4 potatoes.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. We usually do a canned sweet potato with a basic butter and brown sugar. This recipe is 100 times better!!! It was everyone’s favorite side. I did bake the sweet potatoes, so easy to peel afterwards. It’s a new favorite!

Really good recipe … I made a mistake and put the brown sugar in the casserole itself so for the topping I was out of brown sugar and made my own by adding a couple of teaspoons of molasses and it was fantastic; a mistake turned into rave reviews!

Excellent recipe! I made as instructed except I baked the potatoes and although it was very good, next time I'll cut back on the sugar. Family loved it, especially my skeptical husband which swore he doesn't like sweet potato casserole! Only one serving remained and hubby took it for lunch the next day. Adding to my rotation!

I made it with one half the sugar in the sweet potato mixture. I made the topping as the recipe called for. I took it to a Thanksgiving potluck and it was popular. I would make it again.

I am asked every year to make this for our big family (30+) Thanksgiving.  I make two 9 X 13 cake pans full and never bring home leftovers.  I have cut the sugar and brown sugar in half and it is still sweet.  I also substituted caramel flavoring for the Vanilla.  It is awesome.

I substituted agave syrup for the sugar, and blended the topping (frozen butter, brown sugar, flour and pecans) before sprinkling over the top.  Everybody loved it and at least three people have asked for the recipe.  It was better than last year's.

Delicious! For the most part I followed the recipe as written, but I did take the advise about reducing the sugar to 1/2 a cup, only change I made, and everyone really loved it.

I thought it was the perfect balance between the sweetness crunchy layer and the sweet potatoes.   Other than using fresh sweet potatoes I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make again.  The family loved it.

I used the same measurement except for the nuts which I didn't include since my niece was allergic to it. Everybody loves it and I will definitely make this again this coming New Year's Eve for our party. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I couldn't find my recipe. So I looked on Allrecipes.com. This one is the closest to my recipe. I did however double the topping. My grown son loves this casserole. But likes lots of topping. For the first time, I used canned sweet potatoes that were canned with Splenda. Two 29 oz. cans of Bruce's yams will make 4 cups.

I made this dish according to recipe.  Yes, it was very sweet but everyone seemed to love it.  Also, I made it the day before and although I was reluctant, I even put the topping on the day before.  Still turned out great.

Delicious! 
I used fresh  sweet potatoes that i baked off  beforehand. And omitted the nut cause I didn't have any. 
I could eat it by the bowl full.

Easy recipe!  Big hit with the family. Taste more like a dessert!  I used fresh potatoes, no canned.  Also the flavor of the potatoe taste better if you bake and not boil the potatoes!

Didn't add any ingredients, however I noted other poster's comments on excessive sweetness and cut the brown and white sugars in half. Came out perfect for my taste, Rave reviews from family and guests Thanksgiving day. Will definitely make this a mainstay on holiday dinners

Have made this for years, always a hit with my family, I do cut down the sugar, it is very sweet, so if used as a side for a savory meal, less sugar is adequate.

I have been making this recipe for many years and it has now become a family tradition on Thanksgiving. We recently moved to a new state and had a progressive dinner in December and i made this dish, and once again friends and neighbors have raved about it. My one neighbor went out to a  restaurant and ordered sweet potato casserole only to say it was disapointing because it was not as good as this recipe!

This is so sinfully delicious!  I used four very large roasted, mashed sweet potatoes so probably more than 4 cups mashed.  Used the same amount of other ingredients for the mash, but added dashes of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice.  Used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar for the topping.  It is so yummy I'm not sure we'll be able to portion this out!

Made this for a dish at my sons preschool  potluck and the teachers were asking for the recipe, they said they didn't want to share with the kids. Also had to leave out the nuts instead used raisins.

This was great! I halved it to try. I definitely didn't want it too sweet, so I cut the sugar (I used brown) in almost half for the sweet potato mixture. The topping is very good, and the sweetness there makes up for it. I also added about 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the mixture and a little to the topping. I just sampled some warm out of the oven, and it was delicious. I'm thinking this could make a nice dessert with whipped cream...like sweet potato pie without the crust! Nice recipe!

This dish just became the expected dish served for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's so good! I cut back some on the sugar the second time because it was extremely sweet. Will gladly make it as many times as requested.

This is easy and good. If you make it as listed it is very sweet - almost like a dessert. I cut the sugar in the sweet potato in half and only used half the topping because I wanted it as a side for Thanksgiving dinner.

Sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly.  Don't need to make any changes. I made it for Thanksgiving and lots of people that hate sweet potatoes loved this! My father-in-law makes a recipe similar but with butternut squash. I love it and will make it every Thanksgiving. I hate usual Thanksgiving sweet potatoes but love this. Almost like a dessert or a pie. Thanks for the recipe!

Most of these type recipes tend to be too sweet, so I pre-emptively cut the sugar in half and it came out good.  I didn't have any pecans, so left them out.

This recipe was a hit-again! We love the sweet potato flavor enhanced with these comfort flavors :). I baked my potatoes beforehand, as recommended and I also used only 1/2 the ingredients for the topping. Made believers out of white-spud-only relatives!

We loved it, but I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup,also less butter and flour. Added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon too.  Made only half the amount of topping but it was plenty. Remember, sweet potatoes are plenty sweet as is.  This will be a family favorite.

I've never liked sweet potatoes, especially the marshmellow topping. ew!  These were GREAT!  I cut back on the sugar. I only put topping on half the pan since the kids dont like nuts. Just great!!!

This was delicious!!! The only change I made was to add a small handfull of coconut to the topping. I wouldn't change anything else.

I have made this for the past 2 years for every Holiday. It's the one dish they all ask me to bring.  It's so delish.  I always cut the sugar in half.  Sweet Potatos are naturally sweet!  Emmm, a family keeper!

I thought this was perfect. Nice and sweet the way holiday sweet potatoes should be. Everyone loved it and they disappeared.

This turned out good, and my boyfriend liked it. That was my goal. I used marshmallows on top. Will use this recipe from now on.

My sister-in-law made this for Thanksgiving, with a little less brown sugar, and it was delicious.

We had this at a friends house over the weekend.  When I asked for her recipe she printed this out for me.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatos but this was good and even my picky three year old had seconds.  Thanks for the post.

This is truly one of the best dishes I've ever tasted. Perfect for the holidays, I've used it for two years in a row and it's now a staple for Thanksgiving in my house. My only suggestion would be DO NOT CHANGE A THING. It's perfectly delicious as is.

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving ever since I found it 5 years ago! I'm not a sweet potato fan, but I don't think I could have another Thanksgiving without them!! They're FANTASTIC!! Thanks, Connie!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I've made it before, but this was a little different.  The kids even liked it.  They said it tasted like candy.:)
