What a great find this recipe is!  I'm not sure how or why, but it does not taste at all like a low fat version of potato salad; the dressing is creamy and delicious.  I used fresh dill because I had some in the fridge, used a few more green onions because I love the onion flavor in potato salad, and liberally salt and peppered. Fabulous recipe, What A Dish, thanks!

Good basic recipe you can alter a bit if necessary. Once the red potatoes were close to fork tender, I drained in colander & placed in a large bowl (hot potatoes continue to cook a bit). I'm going try roasting potatoes like other submitter suggested next time. To warm potatoes I added a Tsp dehydrated minced onions, 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1 Tblsp of white balsamic vinegar and S&P. Tossed all together, covered & set aside for potatoes to absorb. Used 1/4 cup of mayo, 1/2 C s.crm & 2 eggs as I only had 5 red potatoes. Didn't reduce other ingredients.  I mixed all the "wet" ingredients together separately (added a tsp of dill weed & used sweet pickle relish) then folded into the room temp potatoes. Added a tsp of Splenda for a tiny bit of sweet. Immediately store in fridge for at least a couple hours although I make day b4. How AWESOME! Mixed in cooked bacon crumbles right before serving. For anybody who may not realize - don't double dip utensil when tasting for adjustments...saliva will make the potato salad turn runny (I know, gross) but true!

This was GREAT. I did roast my potatoes with a little EVOO/salt/pepper in a 400* oven for about a half hour (and if you haven't done this before and then use in a potato salad, you're missing out!!!!), then made the salad as directed. I did increase the dill pickle just a bit and I used onion powder instead of onion salt as it was salty enough with just the pickles. I did add a little shredded cheddar as my boys are adamant on adding cheddar to all potato salads. My family loved this!

It was a good potato salad although not quite as flavorful as I had thought it would be.  I didn't have too much left over after serving it at a party so that is good.  I would probably increase some of the seasonings next time.

For me, the light flavor is what's so appealing about this salad.  It doesn't have the overpowering flavor of mayonnaise.  When finished, I did need to add more salt (cold dishes tend to need more) but the recipe does say salt "to taste".  The whole fam loved it.

One of the things that appealed to me about this recipe was the higher ratio of sour cream to mayonnaise. Some mayonnaise based salads are so heavy on the mayo that it tends to dominate other flavors. As a matter of personal preference I used full fat sour cream, Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt, and considerably more celery, dill pickles and dill weed. Creamy, delicious, and very pretty potato salad!

The best PS we have had and we are a Miracle Whip family.  For the potatoes: Selected red skins, all about 2 in. in diameter for uniform cooking.  Leaving the skin on, cut in quarters, gently boiled, covered, in salted water for 10 min., let sit in hot water for 5 min.  Perfect, fork tender.  Drained, rinsed in cold water, spread out on paper towels skin side down and seasoned with salt and pepper. Left to cool.  For the "sauce": mixed all ingredients, except the potatoes and eggs, a day ahead to let flavors come together.  Added some MW for the extra spices.  The recipe called for 1/2 c mayo so added an extra 1/4 c MW.  The sauce may seem to contain too much dill at this point but it will be fine.  Mixed "sauce", bite size  potatoes and eggs together about 9 hrs. before serving and that seemed to be enough time for the flavors to come together.  Only need about 3/4 of the "sauce".  One caution - make more than you you think you will need, people really load up on this.  For 8 servings I would suggesting adjusting the recipe up to 12 servings.

I enjoyed this potato salad alot, minor changes I made were that I upped all the spices about 3-4 times and used regular sour cream, never have liked the flavor of the no fat, came out quite zesty and full flavored and still contained compared to the amount of ingredients a fairly low amount of salt.

Very nice combination of spices, thanks for the recipe!

This was SO good & I never would have tried this if it weren't for the reviews. 
It's practically taboo in my family to make a potato salad other than my grandmother's recipe but I was so tired of it and was trying a lot of different recipes. This was the best by far.
The only changes I made:
I changed the servings from 12 to 8 but still used 4 eggs, used regular sour cream & fresh dill. I also didn't need all of the sour cream/mayo mixture and ended up using about 2/3 of what the recipe called for.
Thanks Mitch!

Excellent patato Salad, made it for friends for a Birthday party and one friend in particular never eats patato salad.  She actually went for seconds and her husband asked her if she was feeling ok.  She replied this is the best patato salad I ever ate.

This was really delicious.  I used a combo of Greek yogurt & sour cream.  I had new red & Russett potatoes freshly dug from the garden, so I used a combo of those.  DH likes sweet gherkins, so I used that instead of a dill pickle, and red onion because that is what I had on hand.  Cut the recipe in half.  It turned out great.  Thanks, Dishy! :)

Made it as per the recipe except used real sour cream and real mayonnaise.  Used a whole white onion in place of the green onions.  Teaspoon of minced garlic in place of the garlic powder.  Six dashes of hot sauce.  No onion salt.

Absolutely the best potato salad I've ever made.  We had eight people for dinner.  Each and every one of them raved about it.  There were only about two tablespoons left over.  Outstanding and easy.

Delicious!  I made this today exactly as written and it is yummy.  Light, creamy, tasty and tangy.  I added a tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and it was perfect.  I can't believe that it's pretty healthy, too!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

such simple and yummy recipe! my family loved it! and my husband normally dislikes potato salad. we were out of onions so I used extra celery and it worked out great! we used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo and I added some bacon. we didn't have any hot sauce so I added a lil cayenne pepper and this turned out delicious!! JUST A TIP (I had read another review with this tip and since this was only my second time making potato salad I wasn't aware of this tip and it was helpful!): make the sauce in advance and let sit in the fridge and the flavors become stronger and disperse. when I first made it I thought it was a lil bland and was going to add more, but listened to the tip and let it sit in the fridge while the potatoes cooled too. when I finally mixed it all together it was PERFECT! had I added more it would've been too flavorful. im a picky potato salad eater, and find most home made ones disgusting...but this one was fantastic! thanks for the recipe!! :) we plan on making it bi-weekly!

Fabulous recipe! In the interest of eating more healthy I substituted fat-free greek yogurt for the sour cream and used Smart Balance mayonnaise. I quadrupled the dijon mustard and left out the eggs. My husband and son, who are potato salad geru's, absolutely loved it! They did not suspect it was made with healthy alternative ingredients! (I have attempted the switch many times and they always taste the difference.) This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Like most of the other reviewers, I was drawn to this recipe because of the reduced fat/reduced mayo aspect. I tweaked it a bit more though to suit my tastes - though there are as many different versions of potato salad as there are cooks out there. But here's my version. I used 1/2 purple potatoes because i love the color and they cook up just like red potatoes. I replaced 1/2 the sour cream with fat free plain yogurt. I used slightly more mustard than called for (though be careful to not over do it!). Double the celery and green onion and add 1/2 of a yellow bell pepper (or other colors would work). No hot sauce. Onion powder not onion salt and more than a dash. I didn't add the dill but ONLY because I forgot. It was still yummy without it. And salted pretty liberally to draw out the flavor. Next time I'll try this concept of using the yogurt/sour cream with different "seasoning" - like with sweet pickle relish, bacon, etc

This was allright. I still prefer my mom's potato salad recipe  that I grew up on, I guess. Made this to accompany the brats / Polish sausage and corn my fiance grilled tonight (we invited my parents over for dinner). I was going to make my mom's recipe, but last-minute, I decided to give this a try instead. This wasn't "bad," it just wasn't hers. :) My parents liked this (I gave them the leftovers), and to my surprise, my salad hating fiance liked this too (but he didn't like it enough to have seconds - he is not a potato salad fan in general). All in all, I'm glad to have given this a try, but from now on I'll either make my mom's recipe or the loaded baked potato salad recipe I am famous for. You simply can't mess with tradition! Thanks anyways, What a Dish! :-)

What really made this salad complete for my family was the addition of crispy crumbled bacon pieces.  Without the bacon, it's still one of the most fabulous potato salad recipes I've ever tried.

This salad was delicious, and pretty, too. I took it to a cookout and didn't get to take home any leftovers. I did add a little more garlic than the recipe called for, and a couple shakes of basil, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

This was only my 2nd attempt at potatoe salad.  I like this recipe and so did my husband.  I did add more mustard, mayo, extra pickle, and vinegar to suit my taste.  I did not use black pepper or hot pepper, as I do not care for the spice.  We like this one and will use it again.  I love dill, so I thought it was great.

Really tasty.  I added more dill and I might cut down on the mayo and sour cream a little next time.  I don't think it needs quite so much.  Still really yummy, a refreshing addition to a summer meal.

This a good building block and I would encourage you to make it your own as I did.  As is, you got the makings of a good potato salad.  Everyone recalls that Mom's tater salad is the best, and mine is no exception.  But I like this one.  Things I did different?  Added more egg, celery, changed the ratio of sour cream and mayo.  Used a Thai chili sauce and added crushed garlic and onion.  Except for the potatoes, I minced everything tiny, just like my Mom did.  I hate chunks in my salad.  Anyways, enjoy!

This is by far the best potato salad on this site. Pretty much everyone "doctor's up" their salad in their own way anyways, but this one is awesome as is!

Absolutely great recipe.  Love it at home, and using the servings calculator, have adapted it for use when doing dinners at our local Canadian Legion Branch.  Always gets raves!

Way too much dill in this recipe.  It's a good basic potato salad and I would make it again, but reduce the dill to maybe 1 teaspoon.

Ummmm...YUM!  This recipe is delicious.  I cut the dill a bit (not a fan), increased the dijon by two teaspoons for an extra kick and added diced red bell pepper for some additional color and crunch.  Very, very good!

I tried roasting the potatoes instead of boiling and was not thrilled with the result. The dressing just sat on top of the roasted potatoe giving it a really weird texture. Will definitely boil next time. Quite good other than that!

I make red potato salad often but have never tried it with sour cream. So I made this for a fish fry we were going to. Every one liked it, very creamy and the next day even better. I did add more celery and onions and used fresh dill.

My very picky husband really loved this potato salad.
Instead of the 1 cup sour cream, I did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain yogurt.  Very tasty!  I might reduce the dill next time by 1/4 just because dill isn't my favorite but my family loved it!

loved this recipe! I always prefer a more sour cream based potato salad to mayo based ones, so this was perfect for me. The only thing I did not include in the recipe were the eggs because I didn't have them in the fridge, otherwise followed the recipe

I had high hopes for this 4.5-star recipe.  I made it exactly as written, and found it quite bland.  Not exactly sure what it needed--perhaps more pickles?  Extra seasoning?  I have better potato salad recipes, so I wil not be making this again...but it was fun putting it all together!

Great recipe. I substituted the vinegar for 1 and a half teaspoons of lemon juice. Added an additional teaspoon of djion mustard. Used 1 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream I didn't have the dill relish so I used 2 tablespoons of caper juice! Added 1/2 cup of red onions and 1/4 cup of green peppers. And it came out delicious.

I really thought this was delicious. Refreshing to have not so much of the mayo flavor. All potato salads need salt IMHO and this one is no different in that respect. I thought the amount of dill was perfect. I also used sweet pickles and add some red pepper.  This was a really good salad. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty flavorful and attractive with the red potato skins.  Mine was a little flat so next time I will use most salt when cooking the potatoes.

Great recipe! Took some to work & all the girls in the office raved over it. We all especially liked the sour cream in the dressing. I used both fat free sour cream & mayo to reduce calories. Have also made it with small brown new potatoes with good success.

I used fat free sour cream and then about 2-3 tablespoons of red onion instead of green because I forgot to buy some.  I dropped the dill weed to 1 teaspoon to be on the safe side and that was "dilly" enough for me.  Oh and I didn't have any onion salt, but I can't see how a dash would make any taste difference.  I also sliced two extra hard cooked eggs and put them on top for presentation.   It was kind of bland in the very beginning before I added salt/pepper.  But then once I put in a bunch of salt "to-taste" (the flavor in potatoes and eggs comes out with salt imo) it was great!  Everyone loved it.

This potato salad has great flavor, doesn’t require any peeling, and is low-fat to boot.  The only change I made was to use red onion and some extra dill weed.
I was looking for a potato salad that was NOT my mom’s potato salad, because I know that I can’t compete with it.  She is no longer with me to give her recipe, and I am not a good enough cook to attempt to replicate it without her recipe.  I would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Used regular sour cream, didn't have celery stalks or onion salt so I used celery salt, used prepared mustard instead of Dijon... Will definitely make again! Even my picky fiance loved it. ***Update- Just made this again today and forgot to add mustard- still had GREAT flavor, not sure which way I like it better!***

I made this recipe exactly as listed for my Memorial Day bbq today.  I made it last night and let it chill, and the family LOVED it.  It was a little bland for my taste, but everyone else raved!  Guess I'm just strange.  LOL  Well done, Mitch, for pleasing a finicky family!

I did not like this recipe at all.  I was really excited to find such a low calorie recipe and when I tried it I knew why it was low calorie--no taste except the taste of sour cream.  I will not be making this again.

I really wanted to like this potato salad more than I did. I made it as stated and was so disappointed by how much it lacked in flavor. I had to do a lot of doctoring to make it flavorful. As a base recipe it would be fine.

This was pretty good if you like dill which I do.  I will definitely make it again.  It was pretty easy to make for me and I am a beginning cook.  It made a lot so next time I make it I will half the recipe.  I put in a little more celery in mine because I like celery.

Brought this to a pool party/ birthday party and my family raved about it. I am always nervous when bringing a new dish for a test flight, but it was such a hit I was asked to bring it to the next birthday party the following weekend!
We use plain greek yogurt (male with whole milk rather than fat free) in place of sour cream for everything, so I subbed it here also. I increased the celery too a little, because I tend to not chop my ingredients very finely. 
It was so good! Can't wait to have it again next week!

Great recipe, I have a tough audience and everyone liked it. To make it even lighter, I used low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I used Lawry's Fire Roasted Chile and Garlic powder. Be sure to use Clausen refrigerated dill pickles. The chile/garlic powder gives the salad a slight but alluring smokey flavour, and the dill pickles, celery, and yogurt keep it fresh and light.

Good base for a salad, but it needed more seasoning.  For our taste, more mustard or hot sauce could be added to balance the sweetness of the mixture.

this is a fantastic recipe.  I didn't use yogurt and I didn't use lite mayo.  I don't use diet anything.  I used just sour cream and mayo a touch of apple cider vinegar and a touch of sugar.  My husband loved it and said the best potato salad I had ever made.  Can't wait to make again.  thanks for the great recipe.

This is great potato salad.  I have an old standby that I usually make, but thought it would be fun to try something different and I wasn't sorry that I chose this one.  I cut the recipe in half (didn't want a huge amount in case I didn't like it) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My dash of hot sauce was more of a glug, but I like the spice. I definitely like using less mayo.  I think I will use the dressing recipe even on my old standby recipe.

Thanks for a great potato salad recipe! I had never tried red potato salad mostly because of tradition and I usually don't buy red potatoes. This year I joined a CSA (community supported agriculture) program and received many new or untried veggies through this program. The last few weeks we have gotten red potatoes as part of our bounty. I cooked them with green beans in the crock pot (love my crock pot) from a recipe found here. Yesterday, I wanted potato salad and had more red potatoes so I did a search and came up with several but this one used low-fat ingredients so it caught my eye. I omitted onion salt and celery because I didn't have on hand. The dill pickles add a surprise taste. My husband and I both loved it. I will be making again!

Yes. This is the recipe everyone always loves. You don't even have to be exact with measurements. I use tons more dill! For 3lbs of potatoes, I use 2 tsp of celtic sea salt in the mixture. I put less dijon, and it's still good. I boil them before chopping.

I made this for my mother-in-laws birthday and it was a big hit. I used regular sour cream and mayonnaise because thats what I had on hand. Other wise I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I loved this recipe. I modified it just a bit. The only thing I did differently was adding 2.5 stalks of celery, about 3 pickles and 3-4 green onion. I love the crunch they added. I have had many potato salads before but none with red potatoes. The red potatoes make all the difference. This will be my new potato salad recipe(sorry mom).

Fabulous taste, even though I didn't have sour cream (made with all mayo) or green onion (subbed a tsp. of minced dehydrated onion). The hot sauce, garlic powder and dill pickle make it so much more flavorful that your basic egg/potato salad and you can make it mild or kick it up!

Yum, no celery in the house and had to use red onion, but I love this.  I also think it's plenty of sauce for that amt of potatoes.

Came out good in the end.  Very light feeling.  I cut the dill in half because I'm not that into it.  Had to double up mustard, vinegar, mayo, celery, green onions, and garlic powder. I did not use onion salt or salt.  I boiled the potatoes with a good heaping spoonful of minced garlic.  Will make again for sure.

This potato salad was pretty good but as others have said, the flavor is very light.  I omitted the green onions since I can't eat them, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Since I am not a fan of mayo, I loved the sour cream flavor in the dressing!  However, if I make this again I will definitely increase the amount of mustard and spices, and perhaps use fresh dill instead of dried.  (My husband also agreed that it has potential but was a bit too bland for our tastes.)  Perhaps the light flavor would be better at a summer BBQ instead of at a snowy Superbowl party like we served it!

This was a great tasting, relatively simple recipe.  My only problem -- it was way too runny.  The next time I make it, I will cut the sour cream and mayo in half.  More can always be added if the salad is too dry. Also, I flattened a few large garlic cloves, removed the peels, then threw them and about 6 black peppercorns in the water with the potatoes. I removed them when I drained the potatoes. Though subtle, it gave the potatoes a bit more flavor.

I gave it four stars only because there was too much dressing for my taste. Next time I will either use more potatos or less dressing. Otherwise it is really good.

This was just okay. I spent $6 on dill, and discovered I'm not really a fan of dill. This dish tastes better the day after it's made. I gave it 4 stars because if you like dill, you'll like this.

Some of the best potato salad I have every had or made!  I increased the amount of seasoning, and when I realized I was 1/4 cup short on sour cream, I used low fat ricotta!  It was an incredible addition!  The dressing was quite a bit thicker, but everything was coated so evenly and the bite of ricotta really came through in the finish.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good. Added 1 more tsp regular mustard, used only 1 tsp dry dill and used the dill brine for the vinegar. Excellant.

I've been making traditional potato salad forever so this sounded like a refreshing and healthy variation. We loved it! I used fresh garlic, dill & parsley and added more mustard, salt, pepper than called for (some said it was bland). We love it crunchy so I tripled celery and pickles. This will be my potato salad this summer!!

Great!  I had half a bag of red potatoes that needed to be used so made this.  It was much better the second day but was good even the first day.  Husband said it was much better than "store bought"!  That's good enough for me!  Followed the recipe except that I added a little more celery and dill pickles and doubled the vinegar for tang.  Thanks!

This recipe is Wonderful!!!  I have made a lot of variations to potato salads and this one is by far my favorite.  I changed things up a bit by adding 3 stalks of celery and omitting the green onion.  I also used garlic salt instead of the powder and added 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon.  The dill and dill pickle add so much flavor but I did cut down the dill to 1 tsp...it's amazing.  I will be keeping this recipe and using it for many occasions.

I replaced the sour cream with lowfat yogurt and it was still plenty creamy. Also used fresh dill and left out the eggs.

This is THE ONLY potato salad recipe I've found that I like. It's amazing, and everyone I've made it for absolutely raves about it. I've always left out the dill weed because I never have it, but it's delicious without so I just continue to make it that way. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was looking for a good recipe that had less fat than my usual bacon and mayonnaise based potato salad.  This recipe is excellent.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I usually say my mom has the best potatoe salad ever...but I can proudly bring this one to her bbqs and say mine is the best! Thanks for the great recipe. I added more eggs and pickles only because those are my fav in potatoe salad. :)

Made half a recipe subbing spicy brown mustard for Dijon, red wine vinegar for white vinegar, onion powder for onion salt and minced fresh garlic for garlic powder. Added 1 tsp Diamond Krystal kosher salt leaving everything else the same, and it was absolutely delicious. Also cooked the potatoes and eggs in an Instant Pot for 4 minutes on high followed by quick release. Will definitely be making this again.

Awesome red potato salad. It was a hit. I doubled it and I roasted the potatoes as one reviewer recommended. I made the rest of the recipe as is.  Everyone loved it and had several requests for the recipe.

Hooray!  A delicious and fairly easy potato salad, far superior to that store-bought soupy, greasy glop.  I try to make a batch every Friday in the summer so I have some to go alongside the inevitable grilled fare on the weekend.  Full disclosure: I roast the potatoes as suggested by others.

pretty good recipe. I felt like it was missing something. It definitely needed more salt than the recipe called for. The dill taste is nice, but it could have used more of a kick to really make the whole dish be more memorable. One batch goes a very long way.

I  steamed the potato until the skins were peeling of which gave it a slight mashed potato fluffiness
I used olive oil mayo and two extra eggs (I love eggs in my potato salad)
I didn't have celery so left it out.  Though about pickles but wanted a creamier flavor.
everything else was hand poured though having 30+ years of making I was pretty much spot on.
My husband loved it and the next day I added bacon and heated it up with some Parmesan as a hot dish and now we are too full to move!
This was a great recipe and such easy directions that I could alter it and not go wrong!  Loved it!

Start of a great recipe but this was very bland, like others I tripled the spices - you can't expect dashes and half teaspoons to do anything notable in 3 lbs of taters. A package of bacon crumbled into it helped it out a lot too.

I’m not a mustard fan and was happy to find this recipe.  Really delicious and will make again.  Instead of all mayo, I did 1/2 Greek yogurt—really like the little sour punch it gave.

I made it and it turned out great! I would use less mayonnaise and more sour cream next time. I didn't have dill, so I used chopped flat leaf parsley and a little cilantro. I also used more celery and scallions than it called for. It was so good, I made it twice!

2 tbs dijon
same "liquids"
1 tsp dill
regular sour cream

Very good recipe. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and had no dill pickle but did have dill pickle juice so I used that instead of vinegar, added a bit more celery to replace missing pickle.

I've made this several times and always get rave reviews.  I up the mustard because I like the tang and have separately  used green onions and red onions due to supply and both came out delicious.  I add crumbled bacon on top before serving.  Lovely!

Very tasty!  I used full fat versions of the mayo and sour cream and added another 1/2 tbsp vinegar to brighten it up.  The veg, herb, and spice mix was spot on.  Per other writers, it did need some liberal salting.  A helpful tip I stole from making pasta is to cool the potatoes on lightly oiled baking sheets, where I also started the salt/pepper additions.  One last tweak was to use 1/2 chopped dill pickles and 1/2 sweet pickle relish.  Great recipe, thanks!

Very good recipe. I didn't add the pickle because I didn't think I would like the taste of pickle in potato salad nor did I add the hot sauce. Other than that followed the recipe and it was great. This will be my go-to potato salad recipe from now on.

I had never made potato salad before...crazy, I know, because I love potato salad.  Anyway, I made a double batch of this for a  family birthday barbecue and it was completely gone!  Everyone raved about it. My sister just asked me to make it for our Labor Day cookout. 

I didn't have any green onion, so had replaced it with diced vidalia onion, which I soaked in water for a bit prior to using.  I was also using organic celery from my farm co-op and the stalks were tiny with lots of greens. I included the greens and used best judgement on how much of the celery to use. 

Hoping I can repeat what I did last time when I make it today!!  Great recipe, though!  Even if you've never made it before.

This was a huge hit at a potluck. People even grabbed all the leftovers to go. I opted for nonfat plain Greek yogurt as suggested and I was very liberal with the seasonings. Awesome!

I didn't have any onion salt, light mayo, nor Dijon mustard on hand, so I substituted celery salt, Kraft mayo with olive oil, and Horseradish mustard.  I think it tastes great!  I especially like how it doesn't taste like there is a ton of mayonnaise in it.   I would make this again.

I loved it.  The only thing I changed was I didn't have sour cream.  I used mayo.  Delicious.  Next time I will make using sour cream.  This salad is really tasty.  Thank you for sharing this.  This recipe is a KEEPER!

Turned out very well. Modified based on ingredients on hand, didn't have pickles and did not substitute. I only had yellow mustard so only used half amount called for.  I made it the night before the cookout and it went over extremely well.

Will definitely make this again. Turned out really well. I will add another pickle or two next time and found 3 lbs of potatoes wasn't enough for 12 servings but I had big eaters. I will feel better next time using 5 lbs and increasing rest of ingredients accordingly.

Wonderful and a big hit with the family!! It's my go-to potato salad. Used 1 less egg than recipe calls for and 1 extra potato. Perfect as I prefer my potato salad a bit less eggy.

This is fabulous!!! I veganized it by using vegan sour cream and vegan mayonnaise.  I left out the boiled eggs and it was heavenly.  Love it, love it, love it.  I'll be making this often.

This recipe was delicious -- just what I was looking for. I wanted something with sour cream in the dressing since I served the salad with buffalo chicken burgers (spicy). I left out the egg and pickles, but otherwise kept it the same. I agree that if you can make it ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight it makes the flavors blend better.

I took this to a family gathering and everyone really liked it. I made a few minor changes because of item availability. Used dill relish instead of vinegar & chopped pickle, no hot sauce or dill weed, purple onion instead of green, and I added chopped red peppers.

As a vegetarian, I consider myself a pretty good cook but have never been able to master potato salad until I tried this one!  I used finely chopped yellow onion and dried celery flakes in lieu of green onion and celery.  I also replaced the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt.  I was a bit skeptical about using a dash of hot sauce but it really works.  I couldn't stop eating it!

We enjoyed this very much!  I omitted the eggs and used pickle relish instead of pickle.  Will make again and maybe add crispy bacon!  Good flavor, nice change from traditional potato salad!!'

This was a HUGE hit!  This was my first time making potato salad too.  I changed a few things to make healthier.

I used no fat Fage Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
And I didn't have any dill so I didn't put any in.
I also added two dill pickles and 5 green onions.

So GOOD!

Meh. I made this with yogurt and cut back on dill (my husband doesn't prefer dill). Kind of blah. Guess I'm used to the zestier, mustardier variety. Easy recipe though.

THis turned out good.  It could've used a little more seasoning though.  Next time I will add more.  What I did with the potatoes is undercooked them a little since they keep cooking out of the pot.  To cool quickly I popped them into the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  This also helped keep them firm and not mushy.

This the best potato sald i have ever had.I made some minor changes used 1/2 red onion insted of green, 3 celery stalks, 1/2 cup sour cream insted of 1 cup and seasoned salt.I also cooked potatos nite before so they were cold and didn't mush up when stiring in other ingredients. I am going to made this again but i will substitue mostaccoli shells in place of potatos.Thanks soooo much for fantastic recipe.

I have never been a potato salad eater because of all the mayo used. I really liked this recipe because of the sour cream. My fiance loved it. Next time I will add more pickles. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great alternative to the traditional potato salad. I switched it up a little bit by throwing in a few shredded carrots. I also used a healthy amount of fresh chopped dill in place of the dried dill. I love the smell & taste of this salad with the fresh dill, and it was a hit with everyone! Even my 5 year old daughters had a bit, and it's rare for them to try anything with the word "salad" in the title.

Don't tell, but this is better than my mom's. I really loved the tanginess the sour cream gave. I did have to make a couple of changes because of a lack of ingredients such as some fresh chopped garlic instead of onion and no celery or dill so I used some Spike Veg. I used a bit more than a dash of hot sauce, subbed a generous amount of spicy grainy mustard for the dijon, and used brine from homemade pickles in place of vinegar. I also used Tofutti Sour Supreme and Vegannaise instead of the dairy counterparts. I look forward to making it again when I have all the ingredients to follow the recipe exactly!

This was outstanding for a potato salad. It was so tasty and creamy. I practically ate the whole bowl myself and I do not like potato salad. I used fat free sour cream and light mayo. The only changes I made was that I added 1/4 cup of finely sliced red onion because I didn't have onion salt. This now  replaces my mom's...Sorry ma!!!

this was my first attempt at potato salad and it turned out excellent. I did use a tip tho that my step-dad gave me to back the potatoes first and then boil them for a few minutes. This makes the texture perfect (double baked its called). Loved the dill flavour, will make again and again.

SOOOO yummy!!  This is as good as any restaurants I have had.  I left out the dijon mustard just personal taste, decreased dill to 1 teaspoon as other suggested. I did not have light mayo or sour cream used reg. I will make again and again. This will be my go to recipe.

This was OK. Nice base... but not enough for me.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I agree with previous comments that if you like a bit more salt, grab the salt shaker but I thought it was a perfect blend of flavors.  This would go well with a meal that carries a stronger flavor like barbequed meat.  Follow the recipe and you will get a low calorie but delightful dish.  It is nice to know you can have both taste and health.  Great job WhatADish on a recipe we will make at our home.

This was an easy and awesome recipe.  I agree with the other comments that it needed a bit more salt, but the dill, garlic and dijon were perfect.  This one will have its place as our favorite red potato salad of all time!
