This was great with a few tweaks:  I melted the butter on a pan and sauteed about 1/2 of a small onion (diced) until translucent (omitted the celery).  Then I proceeded as directed except took another reviewers tip and substituted craisins for the raisins (I added about 3 TBSP).  Next I seasoned the pork chops with Adobo and lightly browned them in a small bit of EVOO before adding them to the stuffing.  Also, I used bone-in chops--they are way more moist and tender.  Finally omitted the paprika and apple garnish.  YUM!!!!!

This was great. I used craisins instead of raisins and added a chopped granny smith apple. Will definitely be making this again.

My husband doesn't like raisons, but I really loved this recipe. I had a little apricot jelly to use up so I put it on some of the chops, tasted great

Thanks for the idea.  I made my stuffing with some multigrain bread slices (lightly toasted and chopped) plus a bit of crunch breakfast granola, and used a blend of applesauce and apple, blended craisins with the raison, some onion and melted the margarine.  I topped the bone-in chops with a bit of cajun seasonings, cinnamon, raw sugar, a bit of honey and paprika.  I cooked this at 325 for an hour (covered) to preserve moistness.

The stuffing is very good but the pork chop is very bland by comparison.

Dissapointed, I thought the stuffing and pork chops both came out fairly dry.  I did use boneless pork chops, maybe ones with the bone-in would of been a better choice.

This meal was really good and very filling. I did find that my pork chops were a little on the dry side with very little taste. Next time I might try to stuff the pork chops with the mixture instead. Overall, it was good and I would recommend it to a friend.

The stuffing was a bit dry, but still good. I added diced apples to mine. Also added Cajun seasoning to the pork chops. I had thin bone in chops, and they cooked perfectly in 40 minutes. Overall good recipe!

I have made this recipe many times as written, except I used bone-in chops.  The last time I made it I used 2 cups of cooked diced ham.  Instead of the applesauce and water, I used a small can of pineapple tidbits and pineapple juice.  It's a nice change.

as other users suggested, i tried it with pork chops with bone (instead of boneless chops), and they were not dry. i was worried that the stuffing would be too dry though, but it was really good (moist under the pork chops and nice and crunchy everywhere else). used stouffer's savory herb stuffing. will definitely be making this one again

Stuffing turned out amazing.  I used to packages (1 box) of stove top stuffing.  The pork chops were plain in comparison.  Definitely need to spice them up a bit, or maybe pour a little bbq sauce on them.

This was really a great base recipe, but wished I had added a bit more liquid because the layer of stuffing closest to the pork was a bit dry.  I added half a large apple, half an onion, and 2 cloves of crushed garlic because I had them on hand.  I seasoned the pork with just salt and pepper and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again and next time add a bit more liquid to the stuffing.
