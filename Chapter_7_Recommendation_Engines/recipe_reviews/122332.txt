Made for Christmas and it was excellent. Didn't have cloves but it was still great. I'm not a big fan of ham, but I liked this better than the turkey. Thank you!

wonderful, can't tell that there is horseradish in it, but  I think it would not be the same with out. Watch the ham, with all the sugar it gets dark quick.

Loved this recipe.  Didn't have cloves so we added garlic instead.  Besides that we followed the recipe.  Great simple recipe for a ham.  We also sliced our ham afterwards for lunch meat for the week.  This recipe worked great for that since it gave the ham a nice little tang to the flavour.

I love this ham. My husband is not much of a ham eater and even he thought it was great. The second time I made it, I took it to a potluck picnic and it got rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I made this glaze to go over a nine lb bone-in ham and it was wonderful! I was worried that the horseradish would be too spicy but the oven really mellows out the flavor. Will definitely use this again!

This was excellent!! Used a small fat free ham, added some garlic, reduced the cloves a bit; as per Beckah, threw it all in the slow cooker.  Family loved it, moist and tender.  Thanks for the inspiration!!

easy recipe, but I guess I don't like horseradish like I used to.

This recipe is so unique and absolutely awesome!  I only made changes out of necessity:  I already had a bone-in pork shoulder so used that.  I did not have ground cloves so I scored the ham and inserted whole cloves into the the ham before covering it with the warm honey.  I also had to buy extra-hot horseradish...it was Christmas and there was no regular horseradish at the store.  I don't know what it would have tasted like with the regular, I can say that with the extra hot, it was wonderfully tangy but not hot.  I was hoping for leftovers but there weren't any!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

What an interesting twist to regular old ham. I would never have thought to put horseradish on it. I cooked mine in a crockpot and wouldn't recommend it - but even though mine was a bit over-cooked it had a great flavour. My nephews aren't fans of ham and ate large portions!

Let me begin by saying I am not a huge fan of ham.  When I do eat it, I prefer it in a soup, casserole or quiche.  However, this is by far, without question, hands down the very best ham I have ever had in my life.  I served a portion to my daughter before the rest of us ate, as she had somewhere she had to be- she loves ham, but I have never seen her eat it with such gusto.  She has deemed it the best ham ever too, which is very high praise indeed. Everyone had seconds, some had thirds.  I did follow the recipe, except I didn't slice the ham all the way through.  I sliced it deep enough to let the sauces seep down, but left it intact.  Also, I ended up with quite a bit of the horseradish sauce leftover.  It seemed like quite a bit.  That is fine though, as I like it so much I used it as a dipping sauce.  It is safe to say I absolutely love this recipe, and will be making it again and again.  It is most definitely a holiday quality meal!  Thanks for sharing Beverly Loomis!  I can't wait to have the leftovers of this one  :)
