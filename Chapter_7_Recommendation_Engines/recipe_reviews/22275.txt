Fantastic cake--very moist, very chocolately, very easy to make.  I have no idea why anyone would choose to mix it in the pan, though, unless it's just for the novelty of the idea, and to avoid dirtying a bowl.   Next time I make it (and I will make it again) I'm going to just mix it in a bowl and pour it in the pan.  I followed the directions this time, but stirring the mixture in a pan that's been greased and floured results in the cake sticking to the pan in places.  Not a huge problem, but it would be easier to serve if it came out cleanly from the pan.  Plus, the ingredients would be much easier to mix thoroughly in a bowl.  It's fun to call it a crazy mixed-up cake and give funny directions for making it, but it's not practical to stir it in the pan.  But it is a delicious cake, so thanks for the recipe, Peachey!

I followed this recipe exactly, including mixing it in the baking dish.  I had no problems with it sticking to the dish.  The only problem I had was the baking time.  I had to bake my cake closer to 45 minutes and it was still a tad doughy on top.  Still super yummy, though!  
If you are looking for a fantastic, prize winning recipe, then this is not it.  However, if you are looking for an easy recipe (with ingredients that are almost always on hand) to satisfy a sweet tooth craving that will please the whole family, then this is it.  It is definitely worth giving a try!

This cake is fabulous and so completely easy!  I didn't want to run the risk of making a mess mixing it in the pan so I added everything but the chocolate chips to a bowl and mixed thoroughly.  Then, I dumped it in the pan and sprinkled the chocolate chips on top.  It cooked for 35 minutes in a stoneware pan and came out with the perfect consistency and tasted fantastic.  I made it for a scrapbooking crop and it was a HUGE hit.  You can't get any easier than this and get this kind of flavor.  Try it!

This does taste like the crazy cake of years ago which is a general, but plain chocolate cake without a chocolate punch.  The chocolate chips help, but it's better to mix them into the batter.

This turned out very tasty. It did take a good bit longer to bake, however. After 35 minutes, the center was still liquid. I baked it about 7 minutes longer and tried the toothpick. The cake immediately sank in the middle. After 5 more minutes it was finally done. My husband loved this.

a good cake but it is NOT a "crazy cake" as they DO NOT use milk (or egg).

I mixed this as a regular cake would be mixed.  The chocolate flavour was great but there seemed to be something missing.. nuts? Next time I will ice with chocolate icing.

Very easy and good.  I used approx. four tablespoons butter instead of the vegetable oil, mixed all wet ingredients and then mixed into dry ingredients instead of making three wells as the recipe directs, and used water and half and half instead of milk. I also mixed in the chocolate chips. It took about 45 min to bake.

Not too great cooled/room temp, but excellent right out of the oven and microwaved the next day.  Next time I'd skip the vanilla.

This was a pretty good, extremely easy chocolate cake. It did have a bit of a salty taste (I used sea salt, not table salt), but I actually really liked it. I think it cut the sweetness of the cake in a really nice way. As a note, this is definitely a stand alone type of cake, it doesn't come out even so you wouldn't really be able to frost or decorate it. But it really doesn't need frosting or anything to be really good.

Not sure what to say.  The cake was easy and quick to make, but I don't think it has much flavor.  I don't know what is missing....maybe a stronger chocolate flavor.  My husband thinks it's ok, but then he loves cake.  I am probably not going to make it again.

This was pretty good. I added some toffee, nuts, and loaded the top with chocolate and white chips. Had a weird flavor, maybe from the vinegar?? 
Good with ice cream on top!

I learned to bake cakes with this same recipe (minus the chocolate chips) over 50 years ago--really!!! It was also the first cake my own daughter as well. It's fast, tasty, and foolproof.

I have very little experience making cakes (that don't come out of a box) and this recipe turned out to be a great introduction to home baking. The taste was wonderful and making it was truly fun. My recommendation: careful with the vinegar you use; some of them give the cake a spicy aftertaste that can be unpleasant.

I was looking for a recipe that didn’t require butter and hit the jackpot with this one. It is super easy to make and really tasty! Best part…no cleanup.
