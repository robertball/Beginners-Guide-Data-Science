Because it can be quite time consuming making perogies, here's a suggestion.  Make your filling the day before.  That way you only have to mess with the dough the day you are going to make them. Also, after boiling the perogies, we always saute them with butter and onions before eating. Fry perogies until a light golden brown.  Little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Don't burn your onions. gently saute until translucent.  A dollop of sour cream when serving is a nice additon.

Two suggestions that make go from alright to WOW! 1) After boiling the perogies remove from the water and fry them with a small amount of oil until browned on both sides. 2) Top with cottage cheese. By themselves, they are a bit bland, but with the cottage cheese they are fantastic. 
For the filling, I omitted the prepared cheese sauce and added more grated cheese and a little milk & butter.
We liked them so much that we wanted to have family dumpling cook-off, trying different types of filling. With some leftover dough we made dessert dumplings filled with cherry pie filling which were also very good.

This was OUTSTANDING!!!!!  I have never made perogies before, and was extremely hesitant after reading ALL the reviews.  Even hubby said to just go to the store and buy a bag! Which, of course, to me was an invitation to an immediate challenge!!  It took some doing, but 4 hours later~VOILA!! Very time consuming, as I was all alone, but I highly recommend an assembly line of family members to quicken to project!! I, on the other hand, love to do it all myself, taking all the praise...HAHA!! Luckily, they were an IMMENSE hit with my family, even my 11 year-old, who never eats perogies, EVER!!!  I must say that rolling out the dough was a struggle, then I cut them into perfect circles, which shrunk to 1/2 the size once I picked them up.  Easy to fix, just mashed them down with my fingers, kind of like pizza into a pan.  I then overstuffed them and pinched closed with floured fingers, and froze.  I ended up with 58 perogies and still extra filling, which I froze for later use, and I made it with mashed potatoes, cheddar, real bacon, fried onions, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  YUMMY!!!  My husband and his buddy who is here from Newfoundland, went on for hours about them and my cabbage rolls.  The best compliment is when they say " this is even better than my mom's!!" LOVE THAT! Permanent recipe in my rotation and thanks a bunch, ever so much!! LOVELY!!!

This is a great dough! I did add extra oil...I am a fan of the calories and this prevents the dough from drying out, plus lets face it this dough gets a little sticky...I kept oiling my hands as I kneeded the dough. Filling well that is up to you and what your into... I like onions fried in butter and simple easy....cheese whiz. Makes for great freakin perogies! Here is the trick to freezing perogies...a cookie sheet and wax paper... you can put layer after layer of perogies on 1 cookie sheet!

This was my first time making perogies.  I followed the dough recipe exactly.  Very easy to work with!  For my filling, I used red skin potatoes (because I had them on hand) and added diced onions sauteed in lots of butter!  Also added cheddar cheese, parsley, salt and pepper. I did have some extra filling -- not a problem. When I actually prepared some for dinner, I boiled them as instructed and then browned them on the grill with more onions,oil, and butter (on foil). They were great! Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe - the dough is delicate and tasty and can be filled with any filling you can dream up.  I made mine with mashed potatoes and carmelized onions.  I had to cover my dough with a moist paper towel while making the perogies because it began drying out.  Also, a note of caution - when freezing perogies place on a lightly greased plate or cookie sheet.  I didn't do this and mine stuck to the plate.

I made this special treat for my family's Easter Sunday Diner.  I made them a week in advance and froze them.  They came out GREAT! Everyone loved them!  Def. make in advance.  It took hours to make.  I prefer to roll out the dough pretty thin because I dont care for a really "doughy" pasta.  This is time consuming but the dough rolls out really nice!  Double the recipe and it makes about 6 dozen perogies.  I needed to add a little more flower then what was recomended.  I omitted the cheese sauce but made three differnt flavors, beacon, onion, and garlic.  The onion flavored seemed to be the most populare.

These where the best perogies I have ever made, the dough was so easy to work with, the biggest complaint I had from my family was that I didn't make enough!  One tip I placed the perogies on parchment paper before freezing to avoid sticking to the pan, works great!!

Mmmmm Good.  I haven't had real home-made perogies in over 15 years.  I had to get this recipe so I could learn to make them.  In my second batch I used minced onions in the potato mix, and a whole lot more of cheese, and added some all purpose seasoning/everglade seasoning.  After I boiled the perogies, I sauted them in light oil with more onions, just to brown and crisp them.  I can eat them plain, but my family likes a little alfredo sauce over them.

Great Recipe!!  Thank You!!

These perogies were wonderful! My dough turned out great and easy to manage, and I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. For the filling we mixed potatoes with fried onion and bacon, parsley and about a cup of grated cheese. The result was truly splendid and well worth the effort!

This recipe WORKS.  The measurements are spot on, and the dough was the easiest to work with! I halved it and came out with 40 good sized perogies.  I changed the filling to suit my tastes, adding a whole head of garlic and two tablespoons of dehydrated onion flakes to the boiling water for the potatoes, as well as a good bit of sea salt.  When drained, I mashed the garlic and onion right in.  I also added a bit of chopped fresh dill for bright flavor and color. I made the filling ahead so that it was room temp. when I assembled.   I plan to boil them until they rise to the top, then fry them with onions in butter and serve with sour cream and chopped green onions.  TIP:  To close the rounds, wet the tip of your index finger, then moisten HALF of the circle only, then fold over and pinch with thumb and middle finger (your wet index finger will make it soggy...wet on wet or dry on dry doesn't work when it comes to dough).  I was surprised how easy this recipe was, even though it was time consuming.  Well worth it!  You won't be sorry you tried this recipe!  Thanks so much for a morning of (successful!) fun!  (Edit: after getting rave reviews from everyone, I just had to come back and say how fabulous these tasted!  One word:  YUM!)

As a child my great grandmother would make these. She would boil and freeze them, when I visited she would give me a bag to take home, they never made it home we would eat them cold on the way. I have tried to duplicate her recipe thru the years and there was always something missing. She didnt speak english and didnt write anything  down. I have tried many many times. Part of the problem is getting them to not break open. I followed the dough recipe to a T it was the best dough I ever worked with. It rolled out beautifually, you needed to add about 1/4 cup of flour and then flour all the surfaces. It rolled out nice and thin like a dream. I made my own filling boiling peeled potoatoes, mashing them and adding only onions sauteed in a few sticks of butter. This is a true polish filling, I also did sauerkraut or "kapusta" drained sauerkraut in fried  onions and butter until golden. Great for hot dogs too. The first batch made 25. I sealed the old fashioned way with a fork dipped in water to crimp the edges closed. they made up like a dream so easy. I made the fillings the day before. The batter size is small. Making another batch as we speak and will see if freezing first will prevent breakage. REALLY love the recipe. took less than an hour to fill 25. Not an all day project if you make fillings ahead. My grandmother also made a meat filling one. With ground burger and onions. LOVE the sauuerkraut. thanks for bringing this old favorite back. Great project to fill the freezer

When I made my first batch they all came out soggy and had a gross texture. I made sure I took them out once they started to float. Maybe I'm just not used to the texture but for me they weren't so great! Also I would use just 6 potatoes instead of 8, or you will have leftovers. When I finished, I ended up just frying them and they tasted much better. I may make these again, but I'll change up alot things!!

I have tried several perogie dough recipes and none of them beat this one.  It is absolutely the best. We like our dough a bit thick and so I cut them out and fill them on the thick side. It is easy to work with and comes out great every single time. I do have to work the dough  a lot with my hands after I mix all the wet ingredients in the flour, but it comes out soft and pliable. It is important to let it sit for the 15-20 min, and keep the dough you are not using covered until you are ready to roll it. I roll 1/4 of the dough at a time. If you like a sweet cheese filling, try 32 oz Ricotta cheese, 1 beaten egg and 3 Tablespoons white sugar. Mix well with fork and fill perogies and boil. Excellent.  I make these cheese ones and also some potato/onion ones. I don't add cheese to my potato ones. I simply sautee lots of onions in veg oil and add them to my mashed potatoes, mix with fork and fill perogies. My family loves them.

Love this recipe!  My kids would eat perogies every day if I let them!   Store bought are rather expensive when feeding lots of kids so we gave this a try.  We made the dough and filling the day before and got to finish them up today.  The dough was so nice to work with and easily the scraps worked back into the dough to roll out another batch.  We followed the recipe exactly and only added some onion and garlic powder to the filling.  We had an assembly line going - One to roll a portion of the dough, one to cut the circles, one for the filling, and 2 to crimp the edges.  What a good time we had and have already planed the next batch!  This is a very good recipe, it does take some work and there is a good bit of clean up involved but well worth the it to make these yourself.

I was looking for a great perogie dough and this is it.   I had never made perogies but living in Pittsburgh and not liking the perogies available here in the perogy capital of the nation, I had to give it a try. A co-worker who's been making perogies  forever googled perogies and after reviewing several recipes, found this to be the most similar to how she makes her dough.  What a find!  This dough is perfect.  Easy to work with and delicious. I dumped everything into my mixer and mixed until it formed a ball that clung to the regular stir gaget.  We have been unimpressed by the blandness of this local specialty so I altered Cowboy Mashed Potatoes from this site as the filler by sauteing in butter very finely diced carrots, red bell pepper, onions, jalapeno pepper until onion is carmalized then add garlic. I used softened cream cheese and Velveeta (that's all I had). I made everything the night before so the mashed potato mixture was easy to work with and the dough got a rest.  I also used my pasta machine going up to 4 and doing just enough dough at a time to make 2 pretty large perogies. These are fun to make, seal easily and the dough is so forgiving that it just stretches to compensate for my lack of skill. I put them on a parchment covered cooky sheet, froze them and then bagged them.   They are such a favorite that if I served them with every meal, I'd get no complaints.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

The dough is very easy to work with, has nice elasticity, altho I do find it difficult to roll out to the correct thinness. I read another review that said she just pulled off individual balls of dough and rolled out...I may try that next time, and then you're not left with all those little scraps of dough that need re-rolling. I find this filling a bit bland, and I even added some seasoning salt, celery salt etc.  Next time with add some finely shredded cabbage (saute first).  Overall nice comfort food, will definitely make again!

My Aunt who is gone now had the best recipe for dough, I came here and went through recipes until I found one that was close. This one is the closest and turns out no different then my Aunts. This is the keeper of all dough recipes. The trick to Perogie dough is it has to have sour cream in it to make the dough pliable and firm. For fillings I use my Aunt's recipes for that so I don't bother trying any others as hers are the best among anyone who has ever had her perogies. My rating here is just for the dough.

These were so tasty, and made quite a lot!! I live in a house of twelve and it fed all of us comfortably. Instead of buying processed cheese sauce, I doubled the amount of grated cheddar and added in sliced green onions, garlic powder, and extra onion salt. So good!

Had a pierogie making party with my niece and MIL. For first timers, worked out great! Used dough hooks with my hand mixer intstead of mixing by hand. Kept everything floured, even though dough is sticky it worked out ok. Stopped in the middle and ate some we boiled and then pan fried. Mmmmmmm, good stuff. I made my own garlic cheesy mashed potatoes the night before. Niece was adventurous and added all sorts of things in some for herself. We got around 40 out of each batch, made the dough twice. Thanks Steph!

This was my first time making perogies and it turned out great!  I added some sauted onions and some bacon bits to the potato mixture, and it turned out great. The dough was very easy to work with even though it was my first time ever making my own dough. I just keep using lots of flour on the rolling pin.  After boiling, I sauted with some onions and butter.  Pefect! Thanks for the great recipe!

I picked up cooking from my mother and grandmother. I didn't really cook until I separated from my, now ex wife. So one day I was watching America's Worst Cooks. There was this woman, who made bologna cheese quesadillas for the chefs. Now I have been hungry drunk many times, and in no way does that sound good. She also stated that she used to be a model. After seeing what she made, I can see how she USED to be one. So, immediately after that, I used my allrecipes app and found this recipe. I went to the store. Bought everything I needed. And proceeded to make this terrfic and if you follow directions easy dish. I just made these for Christmas eve and they were a hit. I had family come up to me and say I should open a restaurant. I was so mad at that woman, I made them out of spite. Anyone who gave this recipe less than 5 stars should go buy ones at the store, because you obviously can't fallow directions or you suck at cooking. THUMBS UP!

husband loved this. i learned that flouring my table liberally worked better because the dough would just stick to the work surface when i wet the edges my 'circles'  would rip apart when i would try to peel them off.

what worked for me the best was rolling the dough out (dont forget to flour your rolling pin too!) then cutting out all the circles. then spoon the potatoes into each circle.  then get a brush (don't use fingers, your fingers will become one clobbered up messed in no time!) and a cup of water and wet only one side of the circle shaped dough, pick up the dry side and press onto the wet side with your fingers, pick it up carefully and put on a baking sheet, rinse and repeat. start the boiling the water, and in another pan, fry up some cut up bacon. cook the now frozen perogies in the boiling water, transfer to another dish. once the bacon is cooked, scoop that out and add butter to the bacon grease. fry the perogies in there. when you are all done doing that, put the bacon bits on top of fried perogies then sprinkle chives or green onion on top, serve sour cream on the side.

also in a pinch i used plain yogurt instead of sour cream for the dough mix because i didn't have enough for the mix and to serve with at the end. still turned out great

Excellent-I made these today for Easter week-end. I have never made Pierogi's before. My husband is Polish and loves them. I made my filling with instant mashed potatoes (much faster) boiled all milk no water, added granulated garlic, 2 bayleaves, salt, pepper, about T. of course ground mustard (excellent in all mashed potatoes), 4 T. butter, let small boil 5 min. take out bayleaves-add 1 8oz. shredded cheese (colby, or cheddar) then potatoe buds until pudding like, dont add too much or it will set too stiff. The dough was really nice to work with. A little work, but, trust me well worth the effort. And to the English teacher (DrSz) that said his rude comment about  Pierogi being spelled wrong, some times people make mistakes, it could be a typing error or allrecipe error. That is just rude and uncalled for. Anyway, I did a trial taste, MMMMMMM Good

Yum! I stuffed half of these with a mixture of mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, fried onions, garlic and bacon, and the other half with fried mushrooms and sauerkraut (something a Polish friend of mine introduced me to). Both worked out very well, although one or two fell apart during cooking (make sure to pinch the seams closed very tightly). I would also add that the time in the recipe doesn't account for freezing time. I wanted to freeze mine thoroughly before cooking, and I had to keep them on greased cookie sheets in the freezer overnight. Very time consuming, but absolutely worth the effort!

I followed the recipe instructions, but the dough was too moist that I could not roll it out. So, I had to add lots of flour. The dough was hard to roll out thin. What did I do wrong?? Other poeple seem to have no trouble with dough. Any suggestion??

NOTE:
Frozen ones were tastier than fresh ones. We actually enjoyed the frozen ones!

These are yummy but a touch bland. The potato mixture tasted great when I mixed it up, but the final product didn't seem to have as much flavour. I did saute them in butter after boiling, and let some shredded cheese melt over top before eating. Not a big deal though, easy enough to add/change the filling flavour with whatever you want. The dough recipe and method worked out great. It was super easy, if a bit time consuming (though not as time consuming as I was expecting, actually). Thanks for the recipe, I had fun making my own perogies! Not sure I'll make this often as I do like the frozen ones, but it was a nice project for a day off. :)

The dough worked out great!! My first time making these so I 1/2 the recipe (just in case it didn't work) and ended up getting about 20.  I am going to adjust the filling next time to make the potatoes a bit creamier.. but all in all.. amazing!!

These were really good.  I made them while at my parents' place for the holidays and my dad wants the recipe!  We doubled the cheese and used shredded colby.  I also added garlic and onion powder.  I used 9 med potatoes because I was afraid I wouldn't have enough filling and it was one potato too much.    Will make again on a Sunday (they took a while to make 1.5 hours just stuffing them) and freeze for future dinners.

Better than Babcia's...This is a very yummy recipe. In the potatoe mix I added one large sauteed onion in 1 Tbsp of veg oil instead of onion salt and decreased the potatoes to 6. I also used Kraft melts- four cheese...It makes a good all-in-one substitute.Also when making perogies use a fork to make sure of a good seal of the dough.I strongly suggest after a 3 min boil to sautee the perogies until golden with added sauteed onions.

These are good and fun to make.  I wanted to share the adjustments that I tried that worked:  I used half whole wheat flour in the dough and also used nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I cut the recipe in half, so I only used one egg (did not include the extra yolk).  The dough was fine with all these changes and was fairly easy to work with.  It's time consuming, but not difficult.  I also made my own filling using up leftover mashed potatoes and adding onions sauteed in butter and then pureed, cheddar cheese, salt and pepper.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make!!!  I didn't have the cheese sause for the filling, so I substituted sour cream and light cream instead.   I prefer my perogies to be lightly browned, so after boiling I fried them with some olive oil, butter and onions.  I cooked the onions first in the oil and butter then added the perogies.

This makes the list as a family favorite.

This dough was very easy to work. Great taste. I use Velvetta cheese and creamed cheese in the potato filling. Assemble these and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet being careful not to touch pierogies together. Freeze then place in zip bags. Melt butter and saute onions in the butter if you like. After boiling pierogies place in butter and onion mixture. Enjoy! I just made 124 of these for Christmas Eve with help from DH. It goes a lot faster if you have help!

This recipe is the same as my dough recipe, but it is essential that the dough be kneaded so you don't end up with a tough dough. Shredded Cooper Sharp will give them a wonderful flavor.  Teddyinlove

It took forever to prepare, but it was worth it in the end. However, to make it a little bit healthier, I would prepare the dough with Original plain yogurt instead of sour-cream, it has the same taste and texture to it.

Great recipe with lots of flavour.  The dough  can be a bit of a challenge at times, thus making it time consuming.

I didn´t have sour cream so I used natural yoghurt, making sure to drain all liquid by using a cheesecloth before use.   Once drained, I mixed in a tablespoon of lemon juice.  

I also omitted the cheese sauce and added more cheese.  I also added a dash of Garlic powder and a total of 1 1/2  Tsp onion powder.

Great recipe addition!

What a great recipe... and this dough is VERY forgiving!  This was my first attempt at perogies, and I managed to churn out 6 dozen from this recipe in about three hours from start to freezer.  I boiled one of the fresh ones up right away - and it was SO savoury and satisfying.  I only changed a couple of small things - no processed cheese, double the shredded cheese, and used onion powder, the less processed cousin of onion salt.  Thank you Steph!!!!

Well, this recipe sounds great!!  Something must be wrong with how I'm making the dough.  I followed the measurements exactly and double checked them.  It was like working with a huge rubber band.  I managed to use half of the dough and froze the other half until I could write this review and ask for Help!! I put the ones I made in the freezer since tonight is pizza night.  I look forward to having them for dinner tomorrow.

Very good recipe, but we found it bland. The first time I made this recipe I followed exactly, but halved the recipe. This called for 1 whole egg plus 1/2 an egg yolk, and I foolishly put in 2 whole eggs instead. This made for an extremely sticky dough. Ended up adding a lot more flour. Second time I made the perogies, again, halved, I made with 2 1/2 C flour, 1 whole egg in total, omitted the butter, but added the rest of the ingredients. Filling was 4 lg potatoes, 1/2 C cheddar, 1/2 C Monterey Jack, 1/2 C dry curd cottage cheese, 1/4 block cream cheese, 1 tsp sea salt & 1/4 tsp white pepper. The dough went through my pasta roller on #4 (which is the middle setting) then cut 3 1/4" circles. Made exactly 60 perogies both times from 1/2 a recipe. From peeling potatoes to putting perogies in the freezer was 2 hours, using my KitchenAid to mix the dough and then whip the filling and roll the pasta.

This is a wonderful recipe my husband said they taseted almost like his Babacia (polish for grandmother). I added sauteed onions and bacon to the filling-taste the filling before cooking the perogies.

Followed the recipe exactly. Tasted amazing! The extra ones I layered on a cookie sheet with wax paper between the layers and left in the freezer for a hour then bagged. 

Next time I make the recipe I will add a little butter and milk to the potato, and a little more spice. 

EDIT: I have now made this recipe several times. Each time I add different flavors in the potato. I just made a batch split it in half and flavors are 3 cheese/ Nando's Piri Piri Medium sauce. Tastes awesome!!

The dough is super easy to make. I used a glass I had and they came out the perfect size.

These are amazing! My Husband lived in Poland for a couple years and says this recipe is spot on. We use just regular mashed potatoes,freeze them, and after they are boiled we sauté them in butter with chopped onion.  We eat all of them every time! We also really like putting raspberry jam and cream cheese in to make some super yummy dessert perogies.

It appears that these are a hit even with my picky eater .. the changes that I made are cutting the recipe in half and added a little cream to the potatoes while mashing. Once the perogies were boiled I laid them out on some paper towels to remove the excess water then fried them in a little butter and kept them in the oven to stay warm while browning the rest  ( 425 Degrees )  .. I ended up with 30 perogies which I feel is plenty for a family of 4 ( still having some leftovers )  .. Will make again and add a few other touches to the mix .. perhaps some bacon as other have done or chives, garlic, a different kind of cheese, the possibilities are endless .. served with a caprese salad, sliced avocado and black olives on the side  thanks for the recipe !!

this was my first time making pierogies. I used the sauerkraut filling recipe on this website. the dough was easy to work with. Just great. To make it easier, I cut the dough into squares instead of circles. I froze the them on multiple layers on one cookie sheet with parchment paper separating them.

A-mazing.  These perogies turned out simply fantastic.  Some things I learned:

1. The dough does better the longer it sits.  I gave it an hour to rest.

2. The dough shrinks some when cut.

3. Cutting one round and filling it, then topping with another round, while resulting in larger perogies, was a heck of a lot easier over all than trying to fold the dough over.

My filling was potatoes, three onions diced and sauteed in a good amount of butter with salt and pepper, and cheese.  Like I said, amazing!

The dough for this recipe is really good.  I ommited the processed cheese and also added some bacona and sauteed onions.  I halved the potato amount and kept the cheese amount the same.  I only made half the potatoes because I also wanted to make sausage and saurkraut perogies.  They were wonderful.  Definitely boil then fry in a generous amount of butter and more sauteed onions.

This recipe makes the most wonderful elastic workable dough ever!  Resting the dough is critical,  if you start too soon it snaps back and your perogies will be think,  working with a young friend,  and wanting to keep her out of my way,  she rolled the dough very thin,  i liked hers best.  Yummy!

My Doukhobor babuska called these vareniki.   I remember them with potato/onion and homemade cottage cheese.  My favorite is the potato/onion.

This is an excellent recipe Sheph577.  Time to make another batch!  Thanks for sharing.

Better than the grocery store frozen kind. These were flavorful but very sticky to roll out and assemble. We had to pour a lot of extra oil over the dough to make it work.

great, easy to roll dough.  However, after boiling, we must have let them sit too long and all of the pierogis stuck together in one big mass. Did not set them out on a separate cookie sheet after cooking as well. Should have.  Tasted good, but looked horrible. A little disappointing after all that time we spent!

This is very close to my family's recipe.  Many childhood memories of making "padogies".  We filled them differently and I still do.  In some go mashed potatoes, some shredded cheddar cheese, and some saurkraut.  I just boil mine and  serve  with just hot melted butter and salt and pepper!  It takes a while to make, but so worth the wait!

I used the dough recipe as it was,and it's great,for the filling I used one package of Bob Even's mashed poatoes from the meat case and eight ounces of shreadded cheddar cheese mixed together to save time. They were great.

Awesome Perogies, and my first time ever making them.  In future I will get my teens helping me, it is time consuming, but easy and well worth the effort.  Made Cheese & Garlic, Cheese & Bacon and Cheese & Onion.  Didn't have any processed cheese sauce so omitted, and they were still excellent.  Had plenty of potato left over, so threw in a can of crab and made Crab Cakes.  My Kids are looking forward to making them next time. Thanks Steph :)

These were great! I grew up with perogies...they were a staple in our house and these taste exactly like my moms. We usually ate them with mushroom sauce (cream of mushroom soup from a can). This was my first time making them.  I did not use the onion salt, but added way more cheese. Made the dough and potatoes the night before, stored in the fridge, and then assembled and cooked them the next day. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you very much for the dough recipe. My mother and I have been making perogies for years, and every year we are looking for a better dough recipe.  The search stops here! Thank you!!! We do a very basic filling with potato, lots and lots of cheddar cheese with salt and pepper to taste.  Thanks again!

We used to make these with my grandmother before the Lent each year.  If you have one- use a pasta machine or attachement on your mixer to roll out the dough to a thin but workable thickness.  This will make it much easier!  This recipe is fun with a group and freezes great, Mrs T's doesn't even come close to the real thing!

This recipe is fabulous, but for those out there unfamiliar with Pierogi, they can be stuffed with precooked ground meat (typically beef)& onions, cabbage, sauerkraut, mushrooms, spinach, sweet cheese and even jelly for desserts (boil then fry, top with a little powdered sugar, mmmmm). The key is for the filling to be as dry as possible to avoid "soaking" the dough and as the author mentions, freezing before cooking. My favorite topping is a mix of bacon onion and mushroom for the dinner version, and the kraut and meat ones are terrific in beet soup (Barszcz).

Q: How do you tell the tall, sweet Polish man in your life that you're secretly in love with him? A: Make him 12 dozen pierogies as a surprise while he's at work. Then, just to cinch the deal, make his family 12 more dozen for Christmas. His Great-Grandma passed away a couple of years ago, and with her took her pierogie recipe. I scoured the internet for a close replacement, and the "Grandma" part of this recipe caught my eye. Three years later I owe my wonderful, loving three-year relationship to "Grandma's Polish Pierogies".   But enough about my personal life, let's discuss the recipe. As this was my first attempt to make pierogies, I left the dough as-is, and found it to be light, flaky and flavorful. The filling, however, is another story. I decided to get a bit creative with some (pesto/asiago, bacon/irish cheddar), while sticking with the tried-and-true recipes for the others. All-in-all I spent nine hours making these little delicacies, and it was worth every minute. Have fun!

Excellent recipe. I suggest making sure that you have 2 hours (or more) atleast to dedicated to this. Because it is important to let the potatos cool before filling the dough.

Best if browned in a little butter after boiling.  Topped with sour cream and fresh chives.  Good side dish.

These are great. I froze mine. Learned a big lesson. When you freeze them ,make sure  there is plenty of flour on them. Also, it might be a good ideal to freeze separate on a cookie sheet first. Then put in bag. I didn't think to do this the first time. Ended up with a ball of stuck perogies.

The dough is spot on, this matches the best I have ever had.  Potatoes with gruyere and sauteed onions made an excellent filling.

Awesome. Never had perogies before. I halved the recipe and there were still left overs for two of us. I saute'd 1 1/2 onion (sliced) with 1 Tblsp minced garlic in 5 Tbls of butter. I then saute'd the perogies in the onion/butter mixture, then transferred all to a bowl. I tried them with sour cream, ketchup, & alfredo sauce, but over all I liked them plain (since they had butter and onions on them). My honey liked his with salsa and sour cream. Will make again for sure.

I didn't make this but a suggestion on filling--saurkraut. My husbands grandma used to make us perogies and she either did potato and cheese or saurkraut and they were the best!

This dough was absolutely wonderful to work with, easy to mix up in my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the dough hook, I used another person's filling recipe since I didn't want any cheese whiz it mine, I wanted it like my husband's polish grandmother used to make.  He was very happy.  I made these for his valentine's present.  This dough recipe is definately a keeper.  Thank you!

I was looking for an easy way out! After looking over the recipes I knew this was the onr to go with . Especially having Ukrainian friends. The dough is delousios and forgiving. You can taste the sour cream in the dough. I almost bought an extra container of sour cream just to serve a dollope with the sauted onions as my Ukrainian friends served it but it was'nt missed . an excelent recipe ! Thank you for sharing your family's recipe.

A pasta rollin machine is an easy way to roll out the dough. It rolls out a long sheet of pasta,I put spoons of filling about 3 inches apart near center, fold dough over, pressing air pockets out, I use a round crimping cutter to punch out perfectly sealed pierogi's!

First time making perogies and they were a huge hit.  I did change the recipe.  I don't like to use cheese sauce, so I just used a cup and a half of extra sharp cheddar.  I also minced some sauteed onions instead of using onion powder.  Very good!  I added spinach to some and that was a huge hit.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM! These are the real deal. The best way to keep them from sticking together when frozen is to freeze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Bag them only when fully frozen. They will stay individual and you can take out as many (or as few) as you want from the freezer. This is what my mom called "stick-to-your-ribs" comfort food.

The dough was pretty good with these, the only problem I had was after I had them out of the freezer they stuck together.  I took them to work and found that I had what looked like a mush of dough, so the next time I took them to work I cooked them first, much better.  I also made some different stuffings, potatoes and cabbage, potatoes and meat, sooooo good!

Roll out to quarter inch??  Way to thick.  I rolled mine out to about 1/8 inch thick.  This still only make my yield 11.  I guess I'd still prefer to cut my circles out of premade refrigerator pie crust dough, or use potsticker skins. This wasn't worth the mess in the kitchen.

Very excellent repice , easy dough to work with. The first time I made I followed directions, I founf the potatoes to be "wet". The second time I used the microwave, shaved prep time down, made lots of carmelized onions to add to the potatoes, the texture was wonderful and the flavor was a hit. Also didnt have to peel any potatoes and the result was a dryer potato. Thank you for sharing. Darlene

They took me a little over 3 hours. They were also easy to work with. I would  not mind that they took me that long, but they had a very bland taste after me adding onions, mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Guess we will stick to the store bought ones.

This is almost how my polish and lebanese grand parents make theirs.  It was great, however, if you do not want to freeze them, you can fry/saute them on the stove with a little butter or olive oil. I like mine with fresh cut onion slices.  I also recommend using a fork to press the edges, it looks much nicer and creates a better seal.

I had no idea until I made this recipe just how time consuming making perogies is. The results proved that my hard work paid off though! 
When making these perogies, the only problem I experienced was the thick dough. I couldn't roll it too thin, otherwise it couldn't hold the filling, so I had to settle with perogies with a thicker dough. I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand, so I used low-fat mozzarella cheese and a few tablespoons of cheese whiz. I was nervous that this would produce a funky-tasting perogy, but I was pleasantly surprised! The resulting perogy tasted absolutely delicious.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe! I will definitely make it again.

These pierogies are  very easy to make even for a novice like me.  The recipe did make more potatoes than needed for one batch of dough...This may be because my baking potatoes were large.  I may have had an out of proportion amount of potatoes if I did not roll them out thin enough as well.  That said...  I got 40 pierogies out of one batch of dough.  I made larger 2-3 inch half circles. (The amount each batch makes is determined by how big of a circle you cut out.)  The dough was easy to handle and sealed well when I wet the edges.  I can't wait to make another batch of dough to use with the rest of my potatoes! :)  I did not make any changes to my recipe except adding a bit more cheese and seasoning to my taste with Pepper, onion salt, and garlic powder.

This is a fantastic dough recipe and everything worked out perfectly when following the recipe written. 

I find I don't need to cook these with onions and bacon. Just butter in the pan and fry each side until crispy. 

Fortunately for my husband, I wanted to make pizza-rogies. The dough was still wonderful to work with two days later and it complemented the marble cheese, pepperoni, and homemade tomato sauce that I packed inside each one.  I find that it works best if you put in the sauce and cheese, fold it until it's almost in half, then pack in the pepperoni. Seal with egg white if you're nervous, but freezing them before cooking will do just as nicely. 

Now instead of requesting that we order pizze, my husband begs for these weekly and has insisted that I make them for him for his birthday dinner. A+ on this recipe!

The dough was very tasty but I had issues rolling and stuffing them.  My dough was breaking as I folded them over.

I made this recipe on Friday, froze the pierogis as suggested and actually only cooked them last night (Tuesday).  These are the best I have ever made! My grandmother was from Poland and the recipe is very similar to hers, however, this dough and the steps to make it came out much better.  I know that we never had exact measurements and mixing instructions due to the fact that she basically did everything from memory!  :) 
This was the easiest dough to work with.  Also, I never knew to freeze the pierogis first before boiling, which I can honestly say, none of them broke when boiling.  Afterwards, I sautéed them in butter & onion and ate with sour cream.
Excellent!  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was my first attempt at this recipe.  I didn't have the processed cheese sauce and used a yellow potato.  These were awesome nevertheless! The dough was especially good with the sour cream. They were labor intensive but what food isn't that is made with love?  Thanks for sharing.

Changes I made :  i fried onions and added them to the potato mixture.  I did not add processed cheese.

I fried the perogies in butter and added curry powder for flavour.  I topped with sour cream, green onion, bacon and turkey bacon.

Review:  it was an easy recipe to do but time consuming. The entire family helped and everyone was excited all day to finally cook what we prepared yesterday.

Changed to make:  cook way less potatoe.  I only used half what I mashed and as a result they weren't cheesy enough.

This was the first time I made perogies.  I used a gluten free dough but used this recipe for the filling.  It is absolutely wonderful!  Much better than store bought!  Thanks for the great recipe

So beats the stuff you get in the freezer section! Takes a little time to master the technique, but soooo worth it. One bite and you will be hooked. Makes a ton and that even satisfies my big family. A definite keeper recipe! I plan to add this on my monthly rotation, because it is so worth the time and effort. Divine!

This was my first time making perogies. These turned out AMAZING!!!! I needed to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to the dough. To the potato mixture, I added crisp bacon, onion & garlic. This recipe made 40 perogies with a ton of the filling left over. My husband was eating the leftover filling out of the bowl it was so good! Great recipe!!!

I've made these and they are really good.  My husband loves his traditional family veranika that they have annually for Christmas.  This is very close just a different filling.  I don't fry them but I boil them and put the same white cream sauce and ham over them.  He is excited and loves this.  He asked me to make this dish weekly.  I make a lot of them and keep in the freezer for when I need them.  It's great when making a quick meal.

This was my first time making perogies and although yes, it took a bit of time (although not as long as friends of mine said they spend), it was incredibly easy!  It was fun making them from scratch and being able to fill them with whatever I wanted.  I will definitely be using this recipe whenever I want perogies in the future.  No more store bought for me!

Made these tonight and they were very, very good. My Polish grandmother used to make them and give them to me frozen, but sadly, I never got her recipe before she passed away. So, a recipe called "Grandma's Polish Perogies" was just what I wanted! We did some with mashed cheddar potatoes (I used instant mashed, making them a LOT less work!), and some just filled with cottage cheese. Here is our addition to the process: instead of freezing them and then boiling them,I made them up fresh and cooked them in a skillet with butter and onions. (This is how I used to cook the frozen ones I'd get from Grandma. My husband LOVES them this way and it worked out great.

My daughter and I made this for the dough only since I had a special cheese blend I made and they were fabulous, especially for a few beginners! I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had enough filling for half and it divided perfectly! Definitely a keeper and I will use this recipe again. Looking forward to making the potato filling next :D

Really good!  I had store-bought ones a few weeks ago and I immediately came here to see if there was a recipe for them.  I quartered the recipe, just to try it out.  I followed the directions, but also added a lil' milk, butter, and garlic to my mashed potatoes to make them extra creamy.  I just used a four cheese mexican mix b/c I had that on hand. I layed out some parchment paper on the counter to roll them out on and keep the clean-up easy.    It took a few to get the hang of folding them just right but I turned out twenty medium size perogies.  I placed them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet to freeze, then placed half in a bag.  I then boiled the other half 'til floating, then sauteed in a lil' butter and sprinkled with black pepper.  Very good!!!  Way better than store bought.   I will make a full batch soon and try some variations-add bacon, ham, or spinach--my imagination is going wild!!  Thank you for this recipe!!

These are so much better than their store-bought counterparts! The only thing I did different was using 2 cups of cheddar and none of that disgusting processed "stuff." Can't wait to try other fillings with it. FYI: for those who think these are bland, try frying them in olive oil or butter after boiling. Better yet, deep fry them.

The dough was great, I always use my own filling recipes.  first is potatoe, cheese and bacon, i cheat by using pre packaged flavored instant four cheese potatoes when im in a rush.  saurkraut and onion is second then i mix the left over fillings together to make the third.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I left the cheese out of the filling but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The dough was very easy to work with; freezing before putting in boiling water is ingenious!  Not one of the perogies broke!!  With leftover filling we made pototo pancakes.

Takes a loooong time to make, but WELL worth it!  I fried up the perogies after boiling as suggested, and at a dinner party, i served them with either sour cream or with an alfredo sauce that I made.  Absolutely amazing!  I highly suggest freezing them ahead of time, it took me 6 hours from start to finish to complete this (I was working by myself, i REALLY suggest getting a friend to help)

I enjoy perogies, but didn't make them very often because of the noodle (you had to work fast or it would dry out) well not anymore with this recipe. The noodle dough is such a great texture and allows you to get them filled till all the dough is used up without drying out. Best dough recipe by far.

I was thrilled with this recipe. Everyone loved it and it was very easy to make using leftover mashed potatoes.

OMG!!! These were amazing!! For my first time making perogies, this was a fantastic recipe! It took me about three hours to do, so i think next time i would make the mashed potatoes the night before to save a little time, but otherwise, this was great recipe and relatively easy. Thank you for making my first perogy making experience a great one!! Probably the best compliment of all: my bf absolutely loved them...i had to boil/fry up a second batch that night!!

This was the first time I made perogies, they were outstanding. I did not have on hand all-purpose flour and used bread flour, I don't think it could get any better. Grandma's perogies is a real hit.

It was my first time making these- I made my regular mashed potatoes as the filling- with margarine, sour cream, and an egg as well as lots of salt and pepper.  As I was boiling the frozen perogies I sauteed a few strips of bacon and as the perogies came up to the top I added them to the bacon pan- they were delicious!  Crispy on the outside and smooshy on the inside. I served them with turkey Kielbasa.   The dough recipe is fantastic! I ran out of sour cream and had to add a little milk to replace it but I think it still came out fantastic!

This is my first time making perogies.  The recipe is great.  For the filling I used mashed potatoes, added finely chopped cilantro, garlic and onion powder and finely chopped green onions.  Then followed the recipe and it was fantastic.  This recipe is endless and I can't wait to continue experimenting with it.

I added bacon to the potato mixture. I also took other users advice and fried them up in a little olive oil so that they were'nt so soggy. These reminded me of potstickers in a way. Yummy yummy! I'll add more cheese next time though.

This recipe is amazing, and definitely comes from someone who is authentically Polish. If anyone is attempting to look up this dish for more info the correct spelling is Pierogi.

These were so time consuming but I have no doubt they will turn out fantastic.  I adjusted the recipe a bit as well, I used half whole wheat flour, used a tinge more oil, used instant potatoes (baby red's and buttery) and instead of mixing cheese into the potatoes I sprinkled shredded cheese on top before I folded over.  I also rolled the finished perogie in garlic seasoning (before freezing) to give it a bit of a kick.  I would definitely recommend using a fork to seal down and a double bonus you will get the imprint that you see in Mrs. T's.  My grandmother used make these all the time and I've always loved them homemade.  She would be so proud knowing I'm following in her footsteps.

Very good! The dough was a little sticky and difficult to roll because you needed so much flour so it wouldnt stick to the table but still quite simple. For my filling I added bacon pieces and chopped onion. I served mine with bacon and a white sauce to which I added a little of the bacon drippings and it was delish!

These were a bit time consuming to make but they were well worth the time.  I made a few changes based on other's suggestions.  I used instant garlic butter mashed potatoes to which I added cheddar cheese and sauted onion.  After making them, I put them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  I found they were sticking a little even to the parchment paper so I sprinkled it with flour.  I also cooked these frozen in the boiling water until they floated and then I browned them in a pan with butter and onion.  They were yummy!!

These perogies were really really good. The dough was a great texture and fairly easy to work with (with lots of flour on the board and pin).  It yielded about 60 medium sized perogies.  Make sure to freeze them solid before putting in storage bags...I didn't and couldn't get them apart before boiling.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW... I made these back in april for easter dinner.  My step-father is polish and he went wild for these.  We served them fried in butter with sour cream and a cream horseradish on the side... they were amazing.  I made them exactly as written, except I added crumbled bacon and garlic to the filling.  We froze a bunch of them to eat later and they stored nicely.  I used a tip from a previous reviewer and froze them flat on parchment and then bagged them in freezer bags.  When I wanted to cook them, I brought a pan of water to a roiling boil and then added them frozen to the pot.  They were done when they started to float. YUMMY!

Use velveeta & cheddar cheese.Very tatsy.First I let the dough sit for at least 30 mins.I cut up the dough ball into 1/4's & kept it covered, helped it from not drying out. The dough was a bit sticky but I sprinkled abit of flour on the dough my hands & pin making it easier to handle. The Serving size of 20 doesn't seem right. Using a regular drinking glass & melon baller I made 55 perfectly stuffed perogys. They weren't thin at all. Could have been at least 18 more had I had enough filler.Froze the rest.Overall everyone liked them especially served with crumbled bacon & sauteed onions.

Amazing!!  Being a complete novice in the kitchen I have always viewed perogies as something I could only get from the store.  Not any more! The recipe took much less time than I'd expected and ended up great!  Being a lover of garlic I also added some garlic powder to the filling.  I would suggest adding more spice than you think tastes great because the filling loses a lot of flavour after cooking.

I made the filling the way my grandma did. Basically roughly mashed potatos  (like you'd make for dinner, but not quite as loose)with carmelized onions instead of powder etc. and add shredded cheese. The dough was right on... I added a bit more flour to make the dough a bit stiffer so I could cheat and use my Kitchenaid pasta attachment to roll out.

5 stars for the perogie dough. I added onions, more cheese etc to the filling and my boyfriend's kids loved them- His son is a very fussy eater and he ate more than anyone else!! I'm going to make a batch every month!

I have made Pierogi's for over 20 years. This is by far the best recipe I have found for the dough. The sour cream makes it very easy for rolling. Not my 'Babci's' recipe, but much better. (please, don't tell her I said so!)

My first attempt at these. Dough was easy to work with but the recipe for the filling was about three times what was needed. I made a second batch of dough and still had a ton of filling left over. I will have to play with the filling as well because I found it to be a bit bland.

I followed this recipe exactly, and had absolutely no trouble. The dough was a dream, as long as there is plenty of flour under it as you roll and cut. It makes too much filling, but thats ok, the leftover potatoes leave me halfway to a Shepherds Pie!
Took me about 1.5 hours to roll, cut and fill. MUCH faster than most reviewers. Dont let the time needed scare you away from this recipe.

very tasty. Did not use the powdered cheese. The dough was one of the best ones i've used. Very stretchy yet firm. Holds its ground when you pull it out on a perogi maker.

excellent. fun to actually make them yourself and it isn't that hard at all. I boiled then fried them with onions, sauerkraut and chorizo. i found it a little tough to roll the dough out thin enough and i ended up making them fairly big. i added sauteed onions and garlic and chopped green onion to the potato mixture. also, to get the potatoes nice and fluffy, when you drain them in the colander, let them sit and steam and a lot of the moisture will evaporate. great recipe!!!

The dough for these was amazing.  Best that I've ever had.  I suggest adding sauteed onions and garlic.  Thanks for this!

these were great and fairly easy to make... just takes a lot of time!! im only 19 and this was my first experience with such a recipe. it worked out better then expected and the perogies were awesome. my family loved them we are polish but never take the time to cook from scratch. i added onion and garlic to the potatoes for flavor and i think i could have used more. they were a little bland so adding some more flavor is a must!! 
I served the perogies with sausage and sour cream. BIG HIT!!!!!!!!!

This is the second time I have made perogies. This recipe for dough was soooo much better then the first one I tried. Instead of using potatoes for filling I used mushrooms & cheese. & when I ran out of mushrooms, just cheese. I added parsley, garlic salt, black pepper, salt, and Italian herbs to the filling to give it some jump. After boiling the perogi, I threw a little butter in a pan & browned them. They came out wonderful & the family loved them! :) *Note* These do take several hours to complete but you have a great deal of them once you're done. :)

I was pleased with how these turned out, the dough was very elastic and that made it a little difficult to work with.   I was very pleased that none of them broke open when I boiled them, I have made perogies in the past and that was always a problem.  I used onion in the filling as well and they turned out great.  Overall, I was very pleased with this recipe, thanks for sharing.

My first time making Perogies. And it couldnt of been easier or more delish!!! I seen so many complaints about how long the process was. I guess, we are so used to convenience foods. That its too difficult for some to go back to the basics. I am always proud of my "from scratch" recipes. And this one is a keeper!! P.S. To cut the circles.. I used a Mason jar lid that way I could make them different sizes:)

Best perogies recipe I've tried.  I was a little short of sour cream, and substituted butter for it, which worked well.  The dough was easy to work with.  I didn't need to moisten the edges - they sealed very well.  I made some with the potato filling, and some with leftover turkey moistened with an impromptu gravy made with instant chicken stock, butter, and flour.  After boiling, I saute them in butter and onions.

The only thing that keeps this recipe from 5 star is that it takes sooo long to make.  The dough is hard to mold but the end result is delicious.  I used instant mashed (roasted garlic) and added cheese, bacon and onion.  Great!!

This is an awesome recipe, I will often double this and freeze the uncooked perogies for future use.  I have never had a better perogie, and I've eaten LOTS of perogies!

This was my first attempt at making perogies.  When they came out of the pot they looked a little slimy.  My wife saw them and decided she didn't want to try perogies.  I pan fried them in butter to make them more visually appealing, and she and the kids loved them.

I started them last night and after 3 hours I wasn't even half way done. I couldn't get the dough to roll thin at all so I had to cut it, stretch it out and fill them. The only thing I changed was adding some lightly fried onions, they were really good but I have to find another method to get them rolled. Thanks! (I changed my rating from 5 to 3 because it took SO long, I never finished and ended up throwing it all out after 3 days)

Very good recipe. I used a dumpling cutter so they looked a little different, but the flavor was perfect! I was a little short on the sour cream for the dough, so I mixed together some cream cheese a milk to get a similar texture.

Definitely fry these up in a pan after boiling them. 
I made them using the lid for my smallest pot. It seemed to work fine but made them pretty large.
I found the filling pretty dry. If I make these again I may try adding sour cream or something to filling.
I cut the recipe in half but wound up with a gigantic bowl of mashed potatoes leftover. I only used a fraction of them to fill the pierogies even though I halved the potatoes too. Apparently my 4 russets were at least 2x as large as they should've been. I guess I'll make some potato pancakes this weekend with the leftovers.

WOW, my first time making perogies, made the dough recipe exactly as written, beautiful to work with.  I did add finely chopped and sauté onions to the mashed potatoes instead of the onion powder (just a personal choice).  After freezing, I saute them in butter and more sliced onions, they were delicious! Thanks for sharing STEPH77

The dough was very good and I made my own fillings. It was delicate and sticky dough and for once, I had no « duds » while I boiled them for 3 minutes.  My first attempt I halved the recipe and the second I made 1/4 of it. It was the same with time.   It will be my new go-to recipe for perogies dough.  Delicious!

I gave up on Pierogi dough until I found this recipe.  I did modify it a bit.  Less flour, more eggs, a little water.  But it was great to work with and made a nice thin dough.

These are the best perogies I've ever had! I make them with organic ingredients often. They freeze well which makes it easy to have on hand when the craving starts! I don't use the cheese sauce listed.

We make these Pierogies every year. At Christmas we serve them and our guest enjoy your them very much. This year we added roasted garlic to the potatoes Delicious is all I can say. Try this recipe you will enjoy them.
We came from a small town in Ohio and they make homemade Pierogies every Friday. We’ve never had a pirogi so good before moving to Austintown. This recipe taste just like the ones they made.

Very happy with this recipe. The dough was easy to work with.  It was stretchy and didn’t tear easily. The only problem  I had was it was too sticky. But I used extra large eggs, and I think that was the problem. I just rolled it in lots of flour and then it went through my pasta machine quite nicely.  Very tasty.   This is my new favourite Perogies recipe.

Made these yesterday and they came out fantastic.  Dough was very easy to make and roll.  I made the potato and cheese filling with caramelized onions and a meat filling as well.  Made 60 of them!  Froze half for another day.  My first attempt at making these and I will definitely be saving this recipe for future use.

Such wonderfully creamy whipped innards. Me and my boys Cody and Brody nearly thought we’d travelled back to an old shtetl, huddled by a fire, drowning in soup and dumplings. Food CAN be that powerful, just ask ALL the grandma’s passing down timeless recipes such as this

Great, simple recipe! My 5 star review is for the dough (though the filling is good, too... maybe not quite flavorful enough for me). 

I've made this several times and it turns out well each and every time. I've cooked freshly made perogies, and also from frozen and both turn out wonderfully.

For filling, you can do anything that your heart desires! This is a great use for leftover mashed potatoes. I've also done fillings with sauteed veggies, middle eastern spiced ground meat, potatoes with cream cheese and dill, blueberries with a pinch of cinnamon and sugar inside, cooked apple pie filling... anything goes!

I just made these and my wife loved them.  I’ve never made perogies before in my life and I have to say this recipe makes a great meal.  The instructions were clear, accurate and resulted in a fine product.

This dough recipe is amazingly delicious!!  With Pierogis you can use any filling...I’m sure the one mentioned in this recipe is  awesome, but I chose a potato recipe from this site “Caramelized Onion and Horseradish Smashed Potatoes” as the filling in my Pierogis. I served them with homemade beer braised venison bratwurst  and sauerkraut!!  I found a recipe that my husband and I love to make a whole dinner together!!  It is now our signature dish, thanks for the recipe!!

There are hundreds of pierogi recipes out there. I made this one years ago for the first time and never used another one. I grew up in coal-country PA. The pierogi capital.  And this recipe is the best one, closest in taste to what I grew up with.  We ate many homemade pierogies at home that were made by church groups, firehouses and of course Mrs.T's.

This receipt is terrific.  I have tried many receipts and nothing compares to this recipe. Dont waste your time looking for another perogie “dough” recipe. It is so EASY to make..you won’t believe it. Don’t change a thing,  it’s perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make, the hardest part is filling the perogies and stretching the dough, good thing my wife was home. These were honestly the best perogies I have ever eaten. I'll never buy bagged again. Make sure to use onion salt as recommendes.

They turned out great. The dough was pretty easy to work with once you added a little flour to the counter and rolling pin.   I doubled the cheese and added sautéed onions. They definitely taste better in butter and soft then fried and harder.

I ended up with a huge amount of leftover mashed potatoes, probably could have cut the amount in half. It’s a decent recipe, but I doubt grandma and great-grandma used processed cheese sauce!

I made only the dough for the pierogi because I had a prior commitment to specific filling. But the dough was excellent. Had zero broken pierogi after boiling. The last dough I used was rough to work with and no matter what I did many busted open in the boiling water. The dough is this good- I’ll try the whole recipe next time!!!

We added 
Baked bacon @ 400 degrees for 20 mins then chopped it up and added on top of the potato mixture
seasoned with olive oil salt and pepper 


After the potatoes are mashed and cool we mixed in cheddar and 1 package shredded Farmers cheese as well as 1/2 sweet onion uncooked
Make sure to roll your dough very thin.

Came out good. Wife loved them. I would just recommend that you either make a half batch of the filling, or double the recipe for the dough.  LOTS of filling left over.

I fried in a little oil after boiling.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  The pierogies turned out well and had a good taste to them.  My only complaint with the recipe is it didn't say how much filling to put in each pierogi.  As a result, I seriously under-filled mine and had a bunch of leftover potato filling (which was fine since I like mashed potatoes).  Other than that, great recipe.

Nope. Greasy and oily. They also don’t fry up crispy. They’re too heavy, and not with the effort to roll out.  They were a sticky mess to make and I won’t use this recipe again.

My husband is from Pennsylvania and we can't get them around here. He was so happy with this recipe. He said they remind him of his grandma's. I replicated the recipe exactly and my only note is I had a lot of leftover filling. Next time I will use only 6 potatos. Other than that the family and my neighbors enjoyed them a lot.

I could have used some more details in the recipe itself. For example, the dough was VERY sticky and I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be sticky or if I should add more flour to combat it. (The stickiness ended up being combated by the flour in the "rolling out" stage.) I didn't know how big the circles should be, or how they would shrink in size once cut. That being said, when the recipe was all completed and my pierogi finished boiling they were delicious. I tried a second filling: 1 small cabbage, some baby bella mushrooms, 1 small onion, 1 celery, 1 shredded carrot, and 1/2 a green pepper with seasoning salt, garlic powder, dill, a dash of red wine vinegar, and black pepper to taste. It was a nice alternative to the traditional potato. This had been on my cooking bucket list for a while so I was happy that I had some success on my first try.

I have made this twice so far.  The first time I made them exactly as the recipe suggests and they were very tasty, but pale in color.  The second time, I fried them a bit in a pan after boiling to add some color and texture.  I got a compliment from a Polish girl at the party I took them to!

I had 7 small baked potatoes in the fridge and choose this recipe to use them up (scooped out the middle)...the pierogis were so yummy!  I did not find the dough hard to work with, after reading reviews I made sure to use plenty of flour when rolling them out (and I had to use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 buttermilk due to shortage of s. cream).  I also browned up some ground pork so we had three flavors, potato/cheese mix (did not use any type of liquid cheese!), potato/pork, and potato/bacon.  Need to improve my pierogi shaping, but overall a great recipe and easier than anticipated.  PS.  Did not freeze them but boiled right away. Took them out when floated to the top of boiling water, dried on paper towels and fried in butter - worked out just fine.

Plan to make a day of it! The first time I made it, half way through (2 hours?) I told myself this takes too much time, I'm not making it again... first bite, amazing, 'okay, I have to make this again!' Filling I used cheddar cheese, pepper, butter with russet potatoes. I made the potatoes first, then the dough.

I use my pasta roller to roll out the dough and got a beautiful uniform thickness. The dough was easy to work with, just a little sticky for the rollers so added lots of flour while rolling. I used bacon, cheese & onion with the potatoes. Yum!

I made these for the first time for my boyfriend who LOVES perogies, so there was a bit of pressure. But I did everything the recipe said. But after I boiled them I put them on napkins to absorb the moisture so they don't get soggy. Then I fried them in oil and lemon pepper. If you haven't had them with lemon pepper you're missing out!! It makes all the flavors just pop! I dipped them in sour cream and they were to die for! My boyfriend said that those are the BEST HE'S EVER HAD!!! He can't stop eating them! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made the dough as is, and it was perfect and pretty forgiving compared to other doughs.  For the filling I used my mashed potatoes.  (homemade with sour cr, cream ch and bacon)  Next time I am trying it with my hot spinach dip inside.  Again the dough is perfect!!

These turned out amazing. The recipe was easy to follow and simple. Added a few ingredients to my potato filling - parsley, garlic powder, and omitted the cheez whiz. Was able to refrigerate the dough overnight and make  a second batch the following day. Both sets were great! Family loved the perogies and we will have this on the menu for Christmas!

Made the recipe as is the first time.  Grew up with polish neighborhoods and now live in the south where you CAN NOT get a good perogie.   These are better than I remember them to be.  Just finished making them and had to boil then saute 2 just to be sure they were ok.  More than ok, they are worth the time.  I recommend you flour your board when putting them aside to cook later as they will stick.  Only made the potatoes and can't wait to saute them in butter and onions.  Totally worth the time.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  Just like my mom's. Followed recipe exactly and turned out wonderfully. The only thing I might change next time is to add a bit more shredded cheese to my filling.

I liked the final product but found a few problems; first, the dough was very sticky and hard to work with. if I were to make this again, I would add at least another half cup of flour, or would add only as much sour cream as was needed instead of the whole amount at once. Also, I used medium potatoes and had too much filling, so I would use small ones next time. Very tasty though!

These are time consuming, but oh -so- worth it. The recipe makes approximately 3 dozen, depending on how big you make them. I did have extra potato filling, but that will get eaten quickly in the form of potato pancakes in the morning.

Just made these and they are as good if not better than the ones my dear Mother In Law made or the ones we would buy from a ukranian church.  I didn't alter other than boiling minced onion with the potatoes and using a food mill for smooth filling.  I think I have a winner recipe. Thank you.  I also got almost 8 dozen well worth a few hours in the kitchen.

I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added more cheese to the potatoes.  This dough is unbelievable!  So delicate, not dense and chewy at all  - I think the sour cream has a lot to do with that.  This is my new go to pierogi recipe.  It's a winner, a lot of work, but worth the effort!

This dough recipe is spot on!  I usually fill mine with red cabbage, kielbasa, grain mustard, and mashed potatoes for nice quick, easy meals.  Another trick is to use leftover casseroles in them, Sheppard's Pie-rogi are a fave in our home thanks to this dough.  They freeze incredibly for a quick boil and fry!  I've made HUGE batches and tossed  most of them in the freezer and served them later - they're always delicious!  I've tried my fair share of pierogi recipes since marrying my husband, who is Polish, and eaten my weight in pierogi at various festivals and these are hands down, my family's favorite!

My husband normally buys these from the freezer section of the store, but after I took the time through the very simple recipe, he loves them. They have much more flavor than store bought and you can freeze them.I found out, at least in my home, in order to freeze them. I have to lay them separately on a covered flat surface, then after they're frozen, put them in freezer bags. They have been going quickly!

The dough is the best to work with easy, I did Change out the cheese for brick and I sauted onion and butter for more of a flavor punch. Just like when I was a kid and we got them from the church.
 Also made a sauerkraut filling.
#1 tip, make your fillings and freeze them in portions size makes it so much easier.

By far the best dough for perogies I have seen and used. I will use this one again and again , if the dough is too moist just add flour into it as you pat it out. Turn it over often to make sure both sides have a bit of flour on it. I added about 2 Tbl. Of Italian seasoning to the flour ( I make mine). I also used my own filling:  Mashed potatoes (4 large), scrambled hamburger (1/4 lb), 1/4  C diced saluted onions, 2 Tbl  diced saluted garlic, 1/4 C Sharp cheddar cheese, and salt and pepper to taste.  The dough makes about 60 perogies, the filling is enough for two batches.  Drop individually into boiling water(I keep the water from the potatoes and just add some more to it to cook the perogies.). They will float to the top when done. Then I allowed them to dry a bit and fried in a mixture of canola oil and unsalted butter.  4 people ate all but about 10 perogies.

The dough is the best I've ever worked with. I have been making them for over 30 years and this recipe is the best I've ever tried.  I did not use the filling recipe but the dough recipe is heavenly. Two teaspoons of salt is way to much, I used half a teaspoon. I also omitted the oil.

Really easy to make and very good. Made absolutely no changes to the ingredients. Instead of boiling, we baked them (20 minutes per side at 320). I brushed them with melted butter and salted with garlic salt.

My family is from Poland. I love Perogies. This is a Great  basic recipe for Polish Perogies.  After stuffing the perogies, freeze them for one day!  The next day, Boil slightly salted water and  get it to a rolling boil.  Boil perogies  4-5 mins, they will float - put to side and saute with butter. (If  for some reason your perogies do not float, dont give up on them, just look at the timer and take them out !) I love to put sweet yellow onion and bell peppers in as well when I saute perogies. Get them golden brown on each side . If desired, salt slightly and serve with a dollop of sour cream  on top. You can modify the filling to suit your taste.  So good!

My husband loves perogies, and store bought are expensive and not as good. I have my mother-in-laws recipe, but its very vague and I wanted to try a recipe I had more confidence in making.

I made a double batch of this dough yesterday (I made my own concoctions for fillings, so I cant speak to this filling recipe), and pan-fried up some ricotta/spinach ones last night. The dough was perfect. So good, in fact, that Im making another batch today to use up the potato/cheddar/chive filling I still have leftover!! Highly recommend... and get creative with your fillings, there is no wrong way to fill a perogie!

Amazing recipe! I made some with a fruit filling and they were just like my grandma's. The potato and cheese were excellent sautéed with bacon and onion. I made 1 1/2 x the recipe and it took 5 hours with the help of my husband and daughter, but they had a blast making them. I will not even look to another recipe - I'm certain there isn't one that's even close to this! Yummy!

I am rating just for the dough. This dough is the best I've found in terms of easy to work with, taste, and texture. To make the perogies a little faster, I roll out a long strip about 6 inches wide and 15 inches long. I plop filling in at intervals, then fold the whole sheet in half over the filling blobs, then cut out 6-7 perogies at a time with a cookie cutter, then pinch the edges.  Speeds the whole process up quite a bit over making one by one.

Omg these are incredible. I made mashed potatoes seasoned with cheese, salt, pepper, bacon pieces i sautéed, onion salt and a bit of garlic salt. I forgot to buy perogies and my husband has requested perogies for his birthday dinner, so i am making these... We all tried one and I fear that my family will never want to go back to the frozen kind. Plus i think they'll pig out - i serve them with a bacon cream sauce and cheese smokies...

This recipe WORKS. The measurements are spot on, and the dough was the easiest to work with! I halved it and came out with 40 good sized perogies. I changed the filling to suit my tastes, adding a whole head of garlic and two tablespoons of dehydrated onion flakes to the boiling water for the potatoes, as well as a good bit of sea salt. When drained, I mashed the garlic and onion right in. I also added a bit of chopped fresh dill for bright flavor and color. I made the filling ahead so that it was room temp. when I assembled. I plan to boil them until they rise to the top, then fry them with onions in butter and serve with sour cream and chopped green onions. TIP: To close the rounds, wet the tip of your index finger, then moisten HALF of the circle only, then fold over and pinch with thumb and middle finger (your wet index finger will make it soggy...wet on wet or dry on dry doesn't work when it comes to dough). I was surprised how easy this recipe was, even though it was time consuming. Well worth it! You won't

NAILED IT!!!!!! Best perogie recipe out there. My family wants me to make them all the time. Dough was fantastic, and so easy. We stuff them with something different every time. Today we stuffed them with taco meat and served them with sour cream and taco sauce, and any other taco topping you can think of. Thanks for the great recipe, we love it!!

I've made these quite a number of times. When I'm feeling lazy I just fill with mashed potatoes from a box. It's the cheap and sleazy way but it's less time consuming. All attempts have been delicious and successful. I freeze them uncooked and take out a few here and there for dinner. I boil them or fry them with butter onions and garlic. Always nice to have some stored away!

They tasted amazing, only problem for me was there was SO much extra filling left over. Maybe use 5-6 potatoes instead of 8

Rating for the dough only which is great. Be sure to use the solid portion of the sour cream, not the watery stuff if your sour cream is separated a bit. Otherwise the dough will be too sticky to work with and you will have to add more flour. 

I devised my own filling and I think it's perfect, especially for those who like the Mrs. T's cheddar and onion variety.

To 1.5lbs potatoes peeled, cubed and boiled until tender, drained, and mashed add:
1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
2 ounces cream cheese
1/4 tsp each salt, pepper and onion powder or to taste
1/2 cup minced onion sauteed in 1TB butter until soft

Love this recipe. Easy to work with and very forgiving.  I made 4 batches of this dough and around 400 little pockets of yum. Kept my finger tips floured for handling and pinching. The fillings I used potato filling and a sour kraut & bacon filling and then a mixture of both. For cooking I Did a rapid boil till they were floating,slow boil for 4-5 min,took them out placed in cold water,then baked them in the oven with butter,onions,crumbled bacon for 20 min. That took care of the texture. My wife told me never buy them from the store again.  She likes me again!!!!!

I love the dough. The best one I ever found that only taste but feels right. It's a little long to cook but worth it. I keep making them big so they float so I cook 3mins. Then lightly butter and place in oven and they are awemazing

Awesome! Boiled then fried. Made them with my 10 year old son. We had to "test" them out before making them for the family. Served with homemade marinara. What a hit!

This recipe turned out great! The only thing I would suggest is to make your own cheese sauce if you can otherwise I didn't change a thing! The dough turned out great and was very easy to work with. I would make this again and again, and I definitely plan to.

I liked the dough because it was easy to roll out and stretched almost like rubber without breaking, but in the end the pierogi tasted much too rich, heavy and fat for me. I guess it's all the sour cream, butter and oil in the recipe. And the next day I fried them in butter to boot. I used sourkraut, mushrooms and onion filling instead of the potatoes and cheese, so I can imagine how much richer they would have been with the additional fat from the cheese and then more sourcream on top when serving like in some recommendations! Great if you live in a cold country and work physically outdoors, but otherwise watch out for your arteries! Or eat one piece per day like I plan to! I made them over three days. I made the filling one day, dough in the morning of the next day, rolled them out and filled them in the afternoon and fried them in butter the third day.

I decided to try this recipe as I had all ingredients on hand and it looked relatively easy. However, the dough came out way too sticky to work with. I then realized I had no idea where the rolling pin was, so I wound up trying to make flat circles by stretching small pieces by hand and wrapping spoonfuls of filling inside. that didn't really work either - still too sticky. I went ahead and fried some of the frozen ones. They were a little hard to fry with the ball shape, but they were delicious! So all the points are for flavor. I might retry again and hope they come out as gorgeously as they do in the pictures.

Time consuming to make but worth the effort.  I filled them with the Sauerkraut Filling for Perogies from this site and they came out perfect.  Using a water glass to cut the dough this recipe made 35 perogies.  I had the perfect amount of filling for all 35.  Will make these again and again.

This recipe was very good but I tweaked some stuff. 

Instead of fake cheese I used more cheddar cheese, milk, and butter for the mashed potatoes and then seasoned them with salt, pepper, and garlic.  I also didn't freeze them before preparing or boil them. They went straight into the frying pan with some clarified butter. 

They were delicious and my boyfriend and I had fun shaping them together. Definitely worth a try. If you have another person to help than this won't take two hours.

Usually the star of pierogi is the filling, however the addition of sour cream to the dough gives it a great flavor.  Will be part of my regular rotation.

This was my first time making perogies and they were delish! The only change I will make next time around will be to add a bit more salt into the dough...not much more, just another teaspoon or so! Great recipe!

This is an amazing Perogie dough recipe. I have not made the filling posted in this recipe, because my family has a ground beef filling we usually use. The dough is flavorful, and very tender. We go one step further, and after they are boiled, and fry them in a little butter. It's a treat well worth the extra calories.

This is a great recipe, I use whole wheat flour instead and they still taste awesome. What I do after I boil them is fry up some yellow onion, red pepper and a touch of bacon sautéed for a few minutes  and then put perogies in with everything for a few minutes. Always turns out great!!!

Amazing perogie recipe! Definitely takes some time to do but it is not very difficult. The only thing I found that was challenging was doing it by myself mainly for rolling out the dough because it was very elasticy. Next time I make these I will make sure my boyfriend is around so his duty can be to roll out the dough! I added a bit of hot sauce to my filling to add a little bit of a kick!

I made these for a cooking club that I belong to and they all loved it.  They taste just like the ones my grandmother made.  My husband even loved them. I left out the onion salt and the processed cheese sauce added 1/4 cup more of cheddar cheese instead.

I make these every year for Christmas. I love them. My favorite is the sauerkraut ones. Saute some sauerkraut in butter and add a little brown sugar and fill. YUM! My grandma used to fill them also with apricot or plum filling, remember it is more of a noodle not pastry but a little bit of sweetness they were good.

Love this receipe. It took me about 2.5 hours not including cleaning up my mess. Very easy recipe to follow and they were delicious. I did add two T of sour cream, bacon, and green onion to my mashed potatoes before filling. I ended up with about 60 so probably should roll my dough a little thinner next time. Excellent recipe.

I thought that I had made perogies before but I don't remember freezing them.  The perogies were bland and, even with the bacon, had an awful mushiness to them.  I honestly can't remember if what  I made last year were perogies or not (which is why I gave 3 stars instead of less) but if these are perogies, I think that I will pass.

this was our first try at homemade pierogies, and they were very good.  Definitely add more spices to the potatoes than you think it needs, only because the dough is a bit bland.  Maybe add some more salt to the dough next time?  I needed to add LOTS of flour for rolling out the dough, but it was pretty easy to work with otherwise.  We used grated american cheese and onion powder and salt to the potatoes.  Yum!

Amazing!! I added some onion and bacon to the mix, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Couldn't ask for better. My husband actually forgot what he was talking about, and stopped eating to tell me it was the best thing he ever tasted. I can't wait to try them with spinach and feta, then rosemary and garlic, and who knows from there. Great recipe. Thanks Steph!

I made the filling MY grandmother taught me. I use farmers cheese or sometimes it's called dry cottage cheese. It's alittle difficult to find sometimes but a store with a good cheese section will usually have it. This filling gets an egg yolk added to it and salt and pepper. I also top with sauteed onions and melted butter after they are boiled. If you wanted to boil them before you freeze them, place them gently into the boiling water and turn on the timer after they float to the top. Make sure the water isn't boiling too rapidly or some will definately break.  It's nice to see such an old fashioned recipe getting such great use and reviews. Enjoy all!

I've made this 3 years in a row and am going to make it for the 4th time today.  I'd suggest making the filling before then letting it cool and using your hands to roll it into balls before stuffing the perogies because the filling will be quite hot.  My dough is always a bit sticky so follow the freezing on cookie sheets instructions before putting them together or you'll have a huge frozen brick of perogies.  I live in Japan so can't get perogies anywhere and I give them out to my neighbours.

These were pretty easy to make and tasted good too. I added both sauted onions and onion powder. I also threw in some chili powder too, which I think was a good thing. I didn't have enough sour cream so I threw in some cream cheese and a little milk and I don't think it hurt it any. We will probably never buy another box of perogies. My husband is already to make them with cabbage now.

Not the best of the peroggies that I've tasted, but they were the best perogeis that I've made. But I suggest adding more cheese of herbs because the flavor was bland to me.

I really enjoyed this recipe the filling was really nice, I used chopped onion instead of onion powder and butter instead of processed cheese. The dough was good but hard to work with on the last 10 or so I made.

While visiting relatives in Ireland I discovered they had a craving for perogies. We were not able to find any in the shops so I decided to make some myself. I have never made perogies before but this recipe looked easy enough. Well ... I can tell you these were a hit. They were very tasty and simple to make. The dough was a touch sticky but a bit of flour corrected that quickly. I highly recommend this recipe to all. I'll definitely be making these again.

Pierogies are my very favorite, but I'd never taken the initative to make them myself. They came out GREAT! I changed the filling a bit - added two cups of colby jack cheese, omitted the processed stuff, and added about 8 strips of bacon and some caramelized onions. There was a ton of filling left over - which was okay by me, since the filling is pretty much just the most delicious mashed potatoes ever.

Great recipe!  The dough is delicious and I found it easy to work with. Just be sure to keep your hands, rolling pin, and surface well floured.  I had a lot of potato filling left over - I would make about 5 standard potatoes, not 8.  The froze no problem too.

These were alot of work, but it was a good recipe... will make again.  The benefit being I will get 7 dinners out of this for the hubby and I, so will not have to make again for awhile.  Served with a side of sour cream, and fried them for a min or two after boil (to crispen up).

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes to the filling, added bacon and sauteed onions. Made a small amount of dough to try it out, found it was very elastic like and needed more flour, it was to sticky but I boiled them, then pan fried and added cheese and bacon ontop ( yes lots of calories here) but they were so delicious even plain, my husband wants to make them again. Will definately make these again.

can't in all honesty give this  5 stars simply because i only used the dough recipe - have my favourite filling (potato, cheddar & cheese whiz).   the dough was wonderful!  so easy to work with and very tender.  brought these for christmas gathering and my ukranian family thought they were absolutely amazing!

and it worked great. (added real cheese rather then cheese whiz, added small fresh cooked beacon.) cant recall what elce i changed. but they turned out great for my first try!

This recipe is a keeper. Easy to follow directions. Made enough for leftovers so I froze them before cooking. They cooked up great after freezing. Great as a main dish or as a side dresses up any meal to that "Sunday Dinner" status!

I have been making perogies for years with a different type of dough mix. When I seen this recipe I thought it looked interesting, so I called my mom who is 80 years old and still makes homemade perogies. She said she heard of it before, but never tried it. I tried it today and all I can say is WOW. This makes such a light dough and I will use it from now on. My family & friends always loves my perogies, but they are in for a pleasant surprise this thanksgiving. My husband and I thank you for sharing.

Better than mom's and grandma's recipe! We loved this! The dough was very easy to work with, just needed to add a little flour here and there to keep it from sticking. The longest part for me was filling them and sealing them, but all together, I got it done within 2 hours. For the filling, I took others' advice and cooked up 2 packets Roasted Garlic instant mashed potatoes, and mixed it with about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, about one pack of bacon (cooked in microwave and diced), and 2 Tbl. cheese whiz I had in the fridge. Loved the bacon! Family loved the filling, and it was so quick and easy to make. Didn't have any left over. I froze them first, then boiled them, and finally  pan fried them in a little butter.  Delicious! and so worth the effort! Made about 3 dozen.

I would rate this recipe as #1.  My family just loved it.  When making the dough it rolled well and it was moist.  Just don"t add to much flour at first and just slowly add the flour to maintain the softness at the end of the rolling of the dough...#1 recipie

This are so time consuming but oh so worth it!!! This is an incredible recipe which knocked the socks off my hubby. He is Polish and said he has never had such great perogies. I am extremely thankful for such a great recipe. Thank you so much!!! :)

Grandma's perogies are great. I use to make these years ago, but was frustrated with the noodle drying out so fast. This method is the best for rolling and not drying out so quick. I used Bacon,onion and cheddar cheese in my mashed potatoes and the family loved them. You can be sure I'll make these more often.

It is a great recipe. But if Im not mistaken The original Polish Perogies recipe includes cottage cheese. Thats how my mom made it back in the 60s My grandmother from warsaw poland showed her how to make it. when she came to this country in the late 50s.

WOW!!  so yummy!!  Mine didn't look store bought but they sure tasted like it!  I used a box of mashed potatoes(roasted garlic) and some cheddar cheese for the filling.  For the dough I halved the recipe and only used one egg and instead of sour cream(had none) I mixed some mayo with some water.  The dough was a lil hard to work with(soft), but I found that using only a lil at a time worked best.  I, honestly, didnt find these time consuming; it took me about 2 hours.  But really when you make these kind of things from scratch it's to be expected.  These were very easy and I definitely reccomend this recipe.  Thnx for sharing!

Made for a church International Dinner. . .Went like hotcakes.(I love perogies! Especially fried with butter and onions!) But if you need to makes some without cheese, make sure you label them as such! Mine got mixed together, and the lady I made the ones without cheese for couldn't tell which was which, so she didn't have any. . .:(

Thanks for sharing, I was trying to find a perogie recipe close to my fathers.  This was it.  Just a little less sour cream to make them just a bit less soft. so they don't fall apart when you boil, them,  This was wonderful.  Thanks again

These were very yummy.  But so tedious.  The dough was sticky and hard to work and it took forever to make them all.  I omitted the cheese sauce, a personal choice.   The end result was very good, but when you factor in the time and effort it took, I would probably just go for the store bought variety next time.  Still glad i tried it the once.

Now I remember why I only make these once a year for Christmas.  What a big job these are.  I'm not even a real fan of them, but the family counts on me making them.  This made a nice soft dough to work with, and I'll definately print it out to use again next year.  I didn't bother with the cheese sauce.  I like the idea of freezing them on a cookie sheet, I've never done that before but we did so with our big double and a half batch this year.  The ones for dinner will be boiled but for appetizers we'll fry them in butter and onion.

just got back from Poland. Same recipe.
Excellent.  I used a variety of mushrooms, cooked down, add butter let it cool in fridge. And stuffed them with the dough.

I found the dough to be quite hard to roll thin enough, and I ended up with TONS of left-over mashed potatoes (which I used to make biscuits the next day). They took WAY longer to make than I had first anticipated, but they are delicious in the end! (Although I'm not sure if it's worth all that trouble).
