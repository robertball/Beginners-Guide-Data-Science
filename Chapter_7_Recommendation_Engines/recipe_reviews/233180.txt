I've made this several times now and it's the only way to use up accidentally purchased creamed corn :) After a few iterations, I have converted to use half the butter and only one egg - it turns out just as awesome but without the extra greasy feeling when reheating. You can easily skip the red pepper and onion and use garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder instead.

So easy to make and cooked perfectly at 1 hour,  Good, old-fashioned comfort food at its best.  Really moist and full of corn flavor.  Thumbs up on this one.

Made this for Xmas dinner and my family loved it.   Its perfect for when mashed potatoes and stuffing seem redundant, but you want the unique side.   didn't change anything

Tried this recipe to share with a neighbor who was grilling BBQ baby back ribs, and it was a hit!
To make it dairy-free (most canned cream-style corn has NO dairy ingredients), I substituted an equal amount (half cup) of coconut oil for the butter. I also included a small can of chopped mild green chiles but they didn't add much flavor...maybe chopped jalapenos next time?
Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be sure to make again and again. :)

Easy to make. Cooked beautifully right at 1 hour. Would like to try a little jalapeño next time and make it a Mexican corn casserole. Not for you if you are trying to cook light!

Yes, I used a plant butter and left out the red bell pepper for the first casserole. Got rave reviews from everyone. Second time, I used the chopped sweet red peppers. That was great as well. Loved the pop of the red bell pepper with all the delicious corn. Many thanks for this yummy side dish! Your recipe has become my new comfort food.

This turned out fantastic. Everyone loved it! I doubled recipe for a Mexican train potluck, added green chilies Came out perfect, took a little longer to cook. It was just as good reheated. Can’t wait to serve at Christmas dinner.

I brought this to a women's holiday pot luck today. The ladies loved it, and gave multiple compliments. 
Notes: 
1. This dish is inexpensive to prepare.
2. Reduced to 1 egg, and substituted 1/4 C olive oil for the melted butter.

I made it exactly like the recipe.  It was the best corn casserole I have ever had!  Everybody loved it.  My son said that it could be his whole meal and my friend said it could be dessert!!!   I think I might try it with jalapeños next time.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!! 
I followed it best I could! 

I used 1/4 cup red bell peppers and about 2/3 cup onions (that's all I had) and started draining the liquid to the corn when I stopped and reread the instructions (not suppose to). However, with the minor and unwanted adjustments, it turned out GREAT!!! We all loved it, even my cousin who hates corn. Reminds me of a loaded corn bread, but with much more flavor! 5 STARS!!!!

I added a tad more butter on top when it was on my plate because- why not?! :)

I just pulled this out of the oven, and it is seriously the best. Way better than I expected. I did add a little sugar, based on one of the other reviews (I love sweets), great move. Perfect for thanksgiving

Outstanding recipe, very easy to make.  Baked for 1 hour, came out very moist and dense.  My only modification to the recipe was to add a couple of tablespoons of sugar, wanted it to be a bit more like sweet tomalito.  Mixed with a bit of pepper jelly to give it a little kick, will definitely make this again!

Took this to a pot luck dinner and everyone liked it. The texture was not was I expected, though. It seemed rather solid with no obvious moisture, but it did not taste dry at all.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I sprinkled dried onions on the top before baking and it turned out great.
