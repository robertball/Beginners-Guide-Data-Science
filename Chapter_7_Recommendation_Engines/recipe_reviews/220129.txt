This is now my "go to" recipe for homemade white bread.  It is super easy and you cannot screw it up.  If you have never made bread before, give it a try.  You will be surprised by your results!  I make the starter in the bowl of my KitchenAid mixer, and let it sit, as stated.  Then, using my dough hook attachment, I add the flour and beer and knead for about 3 minutes - until it pulls away from the bowl and looks nice and shiny.  Then I let it rise, and after 2 hours or so, punch it down and shape it in my final baking container for the last rise.  I use a clay baker with a lid (mason cash cooker), and have found that when I use that, there is no need to put the bowl of water in the oven when I bake it.  The clay baker captures the steam and keeps it moist on the inside. I take the lid off for the final 5 minutes to get a super crispy top.  I love this recipe!

This was the best bread I've ever tasted! I added some crushed oregano, thyme & basil to dough and wrapped it in rosemary branches while it rose for extra flavor.

This was really easy to make and creates a really artisan looking bread. The loaf is quite huge too, which I was happy about. The flavor is good, but not as developed as Chef John's pumpkin bread which rises over-night. The crust has a crunch to it and the interior is nice and soft though. I am not sure why, but it makes really good grilled cheeses. Either way, for the beer, in the bread, I used an imported Pilsner style beer, which is a lighter flavored beer. I didn't want the bread to taste like beer and it didn't at all. The bread goes into the oven a little flat, but it does get a nice spring in the oven.

Excellent Bread Shop Quality Bread!  Easy bread to make - easy to work with.  I just made this bread and it's Wonderful!  Crispy crust, soft interior, moist, chewy, & springy.  The flavor of the crust is rustic.  Tastes exactly like bread you would purchase from a fresh bread store.
I placed the yeast, 1/2 cup of flour and water in the bread machine and let rest for a half an hour.  Then added the beer, rest of the flour and salt.  Started the bread machine on the dough cycle until dough formed a nice looking ball (had to add a little more flour).  Placed well mixed ball of dough into a lightly greased bowl and let rise for 2 hours or until doubled.  Took dough out and placed on well floured surface and sprinkled flour on top.  Formed into loaf (very easy dough to work with) then placed on baking sheet with cornmeal on bottom.  Let rise for 40 minutes.  Pre heated oven with baking stone on the top and a pan of water on the bottom rack.  After 40 minutes, make a split in the loaf and place into oven for the 35 minutes.  PERFECT!!

As an avid bread maker I was excited to try this one.  Super easy, didn't take a long time like some other breads I have made, and the texture was perfection.  I chose Blue Moon belgian white ale because its a beer my husband and I like though we rarely drink so I wanted to be picky.  Beautiful, very large artisan loaf with fluffy center and chewy outside.  TIPS: Turn oven on lowest temp and then open the oven door a crack allowing it to cool.  Place a hot wet but wrung out towel on top and place in your warm oven and let sit for 30 minutes.  This will jump start a heavily loaf of springy bread.  Do the same thing for the second rise for 2 hours.  For the last rising on the pan before you bake it, turn on your oven and sit the cookie sheet on top of your oven covered loosely with a dish towel.  This will give you the best results as the heat from the oven will warm the bottom of the pan and warm your dough giving you the best end result.

I have made this bread so many times, the recipe is simple and yet looks and tastes like a loaf you would buy at a European bakery. Texture is beautiful, nice and crispy on the outside and inside very soft and chewy. However once the loaf sits out for a day or two it starts to smell like beer so best eaten fresh.Overall this is definitely a keeper thank you for the delicious recipe!

Delicious and easy. I did need to add about a half cup more flour to make it not so sticky, and baked only 25 min.

This review is for people who had trouble with this recipe.  The original approach is sound, but my alternatives may help those who struggled.

1. Ingredients: bread flour instead of AP flour. "Bread machine" yeast instead of active dry yeast; it is much more reliable.  I had 1-3/4C beer left over from last night (go figure) and added 1/2C water to that.  The extra 1/4C liquid makes a big difference. 

2. I didn't bother with the premix.  I just put everything in the bowl of a stand mixer and kneaded for 10 minutes.  Yes, this is no longer "no knead" bread, but since I have a mixer that will do the job I always knead. Plus, it's essential for developing the gluten structure this loaf needs, imho. 

3. Let rise for four hours, not two.  Because the beer is cold or at room temperature, it will   the rise. 

3. I no longer slit my loaves before baking.  Helps maintain structure and makes for a more rustic look.

4. I no longer use cornmeal.  Parchment paper works better and is far less messy.  

5.  I made one large loaf.  But this recipe should also work for two smaller loaves that would be more manageable.  You could divide the dough and bake in loaf pans also, topping each with melted butter.

I make this bread at least once a week. My kids love it, my friends love it, my neighbors love it. The beer you use does make a difference. I am not a drinker so I don't know the first thing about beer but I have found that Guinness makes the best bread. Have also used this to make rolls, bread bowls, and cinnamon bread. All worked perfectly.

Excellent bread!! I went to FoodWishes and there is a recipe beneath Beer Bread that I used also, with scallops. I made the beer bread then I toasted it in the oven then poured the scallop and garlic mixture over the bread. Wow, what an excellent combination. I could have licked the plate. Thank you Chef John

This is an easy (and would have been more so if not for the trip to the store for the beer needed here) and good tasting bread from a very reliable contributor to this site.  We made this with more than half white-wheat flour, as that was what we have on hand.  As instructed, did not place in loaf pan but cooked on baking sheet, and it held it's form well.  The end result was a tasty loaf.  I love to try this chef's recipes, as they are dependably and consistently scrumptious.  Thanks for sharing.

First time making this bread!  But certainly not the last time....Followed the recipe but used a baking stone (preheated) and parchment paper. When baking was finished I draped a tea towel over the hot loaf and left it to cool.  Softened the crust wonderfully and made it easier to eat....

I've used this recipe many times and every time I do it results in HEAPS of praise. I've never had better bread in my whole life. BTW, I've found if you don't have beer, water works just as well.

Firstly, love Chef John!!! I have made this regular and it is good. A second way is with 3tsp garlic powder, 2tsp onion powder, and 1 1/2 cups of Parmesan cheese (this is my favorite way). Tonight I decided to go crazy though, I made the recipe as is but subbed salt for 1/2 cup of granulated Splenda, rolled dough to a rectangle after 2 hour rise, covered the dough with icing from (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/the-perfect-cinnamon-roll-icing/detail.aspx) and raisins. Roll rectangle into log, tuck ends and let it rise the final time in a large loaf pan, mine is 12x4.5. Then bake as directed, I saved some icing for the top when it came out of the oven. I posted a pic, the flavor was wonderful. As a side note I use Coors Lite beer as it leaves nearly no discernible beer flavor.

This is the best beer bread I have ever had!  So easy! My family loved it!  I ran short on time (30 min) during the final rising, but took a chance and threw it in the oven. It came out to perfection!

Ridiculously easy and very delicious!  This is the perfect solution to my dilemma...  I love fresh bread but my hands aren't up to the kneading any more :/

Thank you Chef John!   My family all enjoyed this easy to make bread.  I watched the video first and followed the recipe exactly.   I used a utility knife from my brother-in-law's desk to cut the slit in the dough.  

Only one thing, and it may only be a problem for me.  I hate beer.  (I was put off by the smell when I poured the beer into the sponge.)  But the bread did not taste of beer, as promised...until the third day.  

I just had a bit of the leftover bread and there was a definite beer taste, so I will eat it within 48 hours or give it to those who do not mind the beer taste.  I will be making this again as it was a hit with the family.  In the video Chef John puts butter on it, but cheese melted on it is really delicious, too.

Amazing bread! I didn't use cornmeal because I didn't have any, just baked on parchment paper.

I tried this recipe using Coors Light, I think it would have been better with a different beer.  The crust was crispy and the inside was moist.  I will definitely make it again.

This is now my go to recipe- I make the bread for my family and this is so easy- I'm having fun tweaking it, so far I'm slowly increasing the amount of home ground wheat flour and decreasing the amount of bread flour which I used instead of all purpose.  Currently

I was looking for a beer-bread recipe that is yeast raised and not another disappointing soda-bread recipe.  Chef John delivers once again.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a whole package of instant yeast, which is a little more than what is called for.  Everything turned out great.  One tiny error is that I cut my slash in the top a bit too deep (about 3/4") and the loaf really exploded outward during baking and my "slit" on top was about 5 inches wide.  Still a fantastic loaf with a nice brew-y aroma but not overpowering so it can be served with pretty much anything.  I used an Octoberfest from a Boston brewer that I didn't care for, but it sure made good bread.  One suggestion would be to stay away from using aggressively hopped beers such as Pale Ales or IPAs - although those might make for a good BBQ bread.

Most excellent and very simple.  I followed the recipe to a T and used Shock Top Honeycrisp Apple Wheat.  Makes a very aromatic and delicious loaf!

Made it using some 5 year old lumpy flour and a can of beer from my shed that was about the same age. I would have thrown them out normally. Wasn't expecting anything thing great but it came out looking a million dollars and the texture of the bread was perfect.

I do find the taste effects of the beer a bit overpowering, but i was very pleased with the results. 

Note; I did check the beer before use and it still tasted fine.

I made this with FourLoko Cranberry Lemonade for a party; I was kinda dubious about using that drink, but I promise it won't affect the rating! I wanted to bring something fun and different, and I love baking a good loaf of bread.

Making the starter was easy-peasy; I put it to "rise" in the microwave after I boiled some water to give it a nice warm, moist environment. I added in the FourLoko and watched as it all turned pink while I mixed everything else together! I had just a bit too MUCH flour (and I used 16 oz of liquid), but it was easy to get the dough exactly as described. I used my new kitchenaid with the dough hook. I raised the dough in the same conditions as the starter. The dough seemed really flat and kinda diminutive, though. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough!

HOLY OMG! It grew a lot on the rise. That made me happy. But what's weird is that the consistency changed. It was difficult to hold, let alone work into a loaf, so I popped it into a loaf pan. Dunno if I did something wrong or not to make it change so much. After the second rise, I didn't score the bread (I wanted it to be crustier) and just popped it in the oven with a pan on the bottom with water in it like the directions said.

Other than the fact I wish I'd scored it, it turned out wonderfully; the tang that was there when I tried the dough was gone, the texture is AWESOME (light, fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the out) and it's pink! I'm saving this recipe for sure!

Super easy. My sponge didn't look as moist as in the video, but I persevered. I used some brown ale I had on hand and the bread came out super flavorful. It was served with some red crab soup.

Cooking Tip. When you put your loaf out for the final rise make sure no cats are nearby. I was getting excited about my bread and put the towel over the baking sheet for the final rise. About 25 minutes later, I went into the kitchen to turn on the oven for pre-heating. The CAT had jumped up on top of the stove and was sitting on the towel over the bread. My bread was squished into the shape of a cat's posterior.

Love love love it! My husband normally doesn't like beer bread but I do so I've tried several recipes and this one nailed it! I followed the instructions to a T and it turned out perfect. The crust was crispy and the bread was deliciously moist. I put it in a ziplock bag after I cut it up and it softened the crust a bit. We've had it several nights in a row and it tastes just as good as it did the first night I made it.

This is my all time favorite home made bread.  I know it defeats the idea of "no knead", but I just put the flour (extra 1/2 cup) beer, water, salt and yeast in the bread machine on the 'dough' cycle.  I divide to two loaves and bake just 25 minutes.  A big hit at office get togethers, parties and family dinners.  Try different beers.  Haven't found a bad one yet, but "Honey-Brown" brews are my favorite.

It definitely just fell short of all expectations.  It didn't rise as much as expected, was dry, and I didn't really care for the flavor either.  Not sure where I went wrong as I tried my best to follow to the recipe without any changes.

This is one of those recipes that I walked around for 3 hours after dinner saying...hey did you know I made that bread from scratch?!?  I am a mess in the kitchen when it comes to bread.  Through the whole process I said to myself this is gonna be a flop but omigosh it was sooo good.  Nice crust, spongy inside.  I've never made better bread and it is right up there with the best of them.  Weeeeeee!

I have had terrible luck making bread so my boyfriend found this recipe to try together. It was incredibly easy and came out with a beautiful crispy/chewy crust and moist, fluffy interior. It looked and tasted amazing. We used Harpoon IPA beer, which, in hindsight, probably had too much "beer" flavor. I'm eating the bread now, on the third day, and it's starting to get a little dense, so I would recommend finishing it on the first or second day. I will absolutely make this bread again.

Seemed like the dough was a little dry so I added the whole 16oz German beer (Salzburger Stiegl-Goldbrau Prem Lager).Also instead of a 2 hr raise I did it for 3 hours (had to go some where that's why,,lol).did not hurt it one bit. did not have corn meal, used the next best thing-Grits..lol..Instead of making 1 big loaf I pinched them off to make like a dinner roll I did not put them tight against each other I put them on A cookie sheet about 3 inches apart for the last raise before putting them in the oven. They came out beautiful, and of course I buttered the top, they make a great hamburger bun and hot ham and cheese too.

Excellent bread! My tweaks: 2 cups all purpose flour, 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1 cup stoneground whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread (strong) flour. Made a great looking - and large - atrisan loaf. No beer smell.  Nice texture. Could have used a 1/2 tsp more salt to balance the sweetness produced by the ale.

Followed the instructions with no alternations as a first timer and it worked out so well... I used a Belgium pale ale.  I'm still shocked I made bread, that tastes great!! Thank you !!!

Hello!!!!!! Thanks for this recipe!  And your video was quick and easy and really made me feel confident while trying this recipe for the first time.  I made it for a dinner party and I was a super hero!  My kids literally fought over the last piece.  Thanks, it was just perfect!

I love this bread. It’s taken me 4 years of owning a bread maker and having mediocre success with it to turn to this no knead recipe with amazing results. My 3rd go around I didn’t have all purpose flour, and used a bread flour instead. This made the bread even better, with a chewier bite.

I've made this recipe three times this week.... it's that good. I have followed the recipe exactly as directed and once my loaf turned out as pictured. twice it turned out flat (the dough rose plenty but was too gooey to hold shape) and only needed to be cooked 25 mins. either way, it was delicious and we gobbled it up straight out of the oven!

Made exactly as written and turned out perfect!  I mixed it in my stand mixer with the dough hook a couple minutes & it was so easy.  My  kids loved it and ate it like crazy fresh from the oven!  It would be great with soup.  If you aren't familiar with bread making and working with yeast I would suggest you check the temperature of your water with a thermometer.  The bread was finished 10 min. earlier in my oven.  I  used a non-alcoholic beer because I had one and it worked great but will be curious to try something different to see if it effects taste.  Pretty much a fool proof recipe.  Thanks , will be making often!

This had a wonderful flavor and I would have to agree with Chef John, that it had a subtle hint of sourdough. I used Coors, as that is all I had on hand. I will make this many more times utilizing different beers.

This was my first attempt at a no knead beer bread.  I made it with Newcastle Scottish Ale and Lehi Roller Mills Artisan Baking flour, which I've been finding at the 99 Cent Store.  It seemed to have an almost rubbery interior texture when it was still warm, which had me worried.  My mother said the texture would be fine the next day, and it was.  It turned out to be like the best rustic crusty breads from the market, just perfect, and tasted wonderful.  I don't know how much the Scottish ale had to do with it, but Newcastle is excellent (and I'm not really a beer drinker) and I'd definitely use it again.  It turns out Roller Mills is a high quality bread flour, too.

Easiest bread to make.  i bake alot, most of my breads and baked goods leave my house smelling like it was on fire.  i burn everything.  but not this bread.  the dough tasted very beer strong and i was afraid the finished loaf would be too strong, but its not.  the bread has a mild beer taste, its super crusty, cooks really well and looks great.  i added oregano into the flour before adding the flour into the mixture.  then i added a tablespoon of honey.  its really good...and huge.  next time maybe all make a few smaller loaves.  i added a picture but the loaf was so large it didnt fit into square.

I ended up with a huge flat loaf of bread that was so stuck that I had to pry it off the pan and after 40 minutes of baking it still wasn't done. I guess I'll keep looking!

I put the bread on a cookie sheet as one very large loaf. I could smell it about halfway through the cooking so I took it out, cut it in half (it was still doughy in the center) and put it back in for about five minutes more. Everyone here enjoyed it. I think next time I will split into two loaves from the get go.

Wished I could give this recipe 10 or more stars!  Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Know this bread is not sourdough, but honestly it does taste like one, since I used live in San Francisco area and know & enjoyed the taste of sourdough bread.  It is an easy recipe and makes a big loaf, not only it taste awesome, but it looks so rustic, like the breads you'll get in a French farm house.  Chef John, thank you for sharing your talent with us all.

I haven't been able to make a 'normal' bread with yeast.  So I saw this recipe and thought, maybe as simple as this is, I can do this.  Well, I did and with a few things differently.  I added 2T of sugar and I made it in a glass bread pan 9' x 5'.  I did all the steps and baked it at 425* for 10 min and then at 400* for another 15 (total of 25 min).  It was beautiful!  Nice crust, which I buttered with the edge of a stick of butter, and let it cool completely.  My husband and I enjoyed a couple of slices each with butter and peanut butter.  Awesome!  I definitely will make it again.  I'm so proud of myself for being able to do this and thank the Chef for the recipe.  Thanks also to the people who gave it rave reviews!

This is a great, no-hassle bread recipe compared to others I have made in the past. I made two loaves. For the first one, I used 2 1/2 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of whole wheat and Sam Adams seasonal Old Fezziwig Ale. For the second loaf, I did it just as the instructions said and used SweetWater IPA. They both turned out great! They look like fancy Artisan breads you buy in the store and the size of the loaves is huge! My kind of bread! YUM!

Easy to make and one of the most delicious no knead breads to eat. I shortened the bake time about 5 min as I like the crust a bit softer. This one is a winner.

I have been making breads for years and this one by far is the easiest, being no knead, and looks and tastes wonderful!  Other artesian bread recipes are very sticky...not this one. I was pleasantly surprised at that!  Thanks Chef John for the wonderful recipe!

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly. I used bread machine yeast (as that is all I use) and it was fine. I live in a warm climate year round, so getting it to rise was not a problem! I also used a bottle of Sam Adams seasonal Christmas beer that my husband never got around to drinking. It turned out great. I brought it to a gathering with some friends and everyone loved it. I served it with some Brie and other cheeses. It was such a hit that people thought I worked really hard on it and all I did was put together a few simple ingredients.

Just finished making this bread. Made two smaller loaves as there is just my husband and I. This is the most fantastic beer bread I have ever made. It has a nice crispy, thin crust and a awesome flavor, almost a loaf gone already. Defiantly my go to for beer bread. Was thinking of making the next batch into 4 smaller loaves and using for sub sandwiches!! Would lightly grease pan before adding corn meal, though. Emailed it to every one of the kids!

Came out okay but I will cut down on the bake time next time.. To much crunch on the outside and just a bit dry on the inside.. I'll give it another try..

Ive made this bread four times now and each time I swear it gets better. My family participates in Amtgard every Sunday and its nice to take a loaf out there to snack on because it looks "period correct" to our characters, not to mention tastes great. One of my best friends has a daughter who refuses to eat anything and last time I made this she ate 8 pieces. Finally I had to just get her mom over to show her how to make it to stop the begging. lol! Amazing work yet again Chef John!!!

So easy to make, dough is so velvety soft but sticky! and came out absolutely fantastic. I followed recipe exactly... what an absolute gorgeous loaf. I even liked it better the next day toasting a slice, then adding butter YUM!!  Such a wonderful textured bread that tastes so good. Definitely making this over & over again.

I made this bread yesterday and I am now the star of the household LOL!  It was so easy and beyond delicious! I used to have a bread machine, but with a recipe like this, don't need one! I think next time I'll separate it into two loaves, or make one loaf and some rolls.....the possibilities are endless! This is one of those recipes that will stay on the side of the fridge as it will be used often! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I love this recipe.  I love to bake bread but have had trouble baking "artisan" bread.  The crust is great and the texture holds butter like English muffins - plenty of nooks and crannies.  The best part - it's so easy!

I haven't made bread for nearly 30 years so this was a daunting challenge...or was it?  This recipe is so easy that with the video provided by Chef John, a child could make it.  Mine turned out exactly, I mean exactly like the picture and was amazingly tasty.  We are making it again this weekend and I am adding roasted garlic for an added flare.

This was my first experience making bread. It turned out pretty well I guess, according to my wife and kids inhaling it. Followed the directions aside from adding some dry Italian herbs. Smells fantastic. Tastes fantastic. If I can do it, anyone can.

I actually baked it in a tall loaf pan which increased the baking time significantly, but turned out well. I also was concerned that the dough was really quite wet and added more flour. It was still more wet than most bread doughs I've made but it works!

Easy to make and produced a very large loaf. Stuck to my pan, so I will use parchment paper next time. Lovely texture inside, will make great sandwiches. It is not as dense as Dutch oven style no knead breads

I love this recipe. It is what brought me to Food Wishes with Chef John many years ago. It is an easy way to deal with a good beer you don't want to drink and makes a sourdough tasting bread that is delicious. Keep this on hand for an easy, impressive loaf of bread.

Will try again. I bought brand new yeast and I don't think it was as fresh as it could have been. Delicious, but never rose much after taking out of the bowl. One big, flat long loaf is what I got. Definitely worth trying again, even IF I have to knead it a bit.

Every time I make this - I swear it’s not going to turn out - but it does. I need to start making two because it disappears so fast in our house!  Guinness beer is the house favorite. One tip I found by accident is that brushing the bread top with melted butter upon taking it out of the oven will make the crust a bit less crunchy if you’d rather it not so hard. I now cook it in a covered Dutch oven and skip the water step (and cornmeal step) too. We make this regularly now

Unimpressive. Smelled good, outside was like a cracker inside was soft bread. But very bland, I realized afterward there's no salt in the recipe? Of I made it again I would def add the most basic ingredient.

I made this delicious bread with hard apple cider. It’s great on it’s own, with a nice hearty stew and makes any amazing grilled cheese! The recipe is easy to follow & I’ve made it many times & never had a “fail”!

Awesome and stupid easy. I rounded up the salt and yeast to 2 tsp each to bump up the flavor. A stand mixer made mixing much easier. My first loaf stuck bad but parchment paper worked great on my second loaf and made cleanup a breeze.

I made this as my "first bread" in my brand new first-ever stand mixer and was pleased with the results. Even though I was heavy-handed with sprinkling the top of the loaf with flour Mr. Man and I found it to be a hearty & welcome addition soup after dusting the load off. I know where I went wrong and will certainly try this easy bread again!

This is one of my absolute favorite bread recipes! I make it with Leffe Blonde Belgian Ale for a wonderful creamy light yellow color and rich flavor. The last time I made it, I divided the dough into 2 round balls for the final rise, then popped each loaf into a small (7 inch round) preheated Dutch oven, snipped each dough ball in 4 places with scissors for decoration, covered each with the Dutch oven lid and baked them in the preheated oven, as directed. Yield: 2 beautiful boules

Great recipe, super easy to make.  This is the first time I ever tried to bake bread of any kind and it came out great.  "Delicious", "exquisite", "splendid" words that were used to describe it.  Made it twice, with 2 different varieties of beer, and both tasted great.  I would say if you like a particular beer, you will like the bread it produces, as it produces a subtle flavor in your bread.  Only caveat to the recipe is that I found 12 ounces to be too much liquid, so I would suggest adding starting with less than the full can/bottle (8-10 oz), and then adjust as needed to get the right consistency.  I also reduced the salt to 1 tsp and I think that was just right .I lightly oiled the bowl I used, and the dough slips right out when you're ready. 

The bread will be good for at least a couple of days (assuming it doesn't get devoured).

Yeasty, chewy inside, crisp outside. Yummy! Used a Sam Adams pumpkin ale that was lingering in the fridge.

I LOVE this bread, and so does my whole family. I make it a couple times a month and changed nothing about the recipe aside from adding some herbs in occasionally. I somehow didn’t realize my oven was on when I placed it in for the 2nd rise and it still turned out good!! I bake it in my cast iron Dutch oven, lid on then off for last 10 minutes. This is a no fail bread!

The only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  I doubled the salt and it does make a slight difference.  Also, I use Guinness Stout.  One last side note, I have chopped up fresh rosemary and added to this recipe and it is also a added bonus.  The amount of rosemary depends on your taste.  I used a whole grocery store small pack. after peeling the leaves from the stems and rough chopping.  The chopping tends to release the oils into the bread.

I followed the directions, and the loaf came out pretty flat.  The bread itself, however, tasted wonderful.  I'll have to play with it just a bit to see if I can get it to have more "body" so it will come out more like a loaf.

I have made this bread several times and my family loves it. I have also made it with several varieties of beer. Even made it a couple times with raspberry ginger beer!  Love the crust, very artisanal. It is not exactly no knead - needs a little to incorporate all the flour

I used the full pkg of yeast 2 1/4 t  and a cheap beer. Next time I will use a Guinness or another stronger tasting ale. This was really good and is okay for toast & very tender on the inside.

This is a wonderful recipe and needs no modifications as it is delicious as written. I only needed to bake 30 minutes and I buttered the top of the loaf straight out of the oven. Hard and crusty top or soft buttered top is a personal preference

I liked it, my boss so-so...  I think I took the “liberal dusting of flour” a little too seriously, had way too much flour to shake off but other than that really liked it.

Used Rickard’s Red Ale. The only change I made is that I divided the dough in half and put it in two loaf pans. Very happy with the finished product. Baked it at 425. Used paper loaf liners to ensure the loaves would not stick to the pans. The fresh cooled bread toasts very well. Will definitely make this again. Made it again; baked it in  Sassafras bread dome. Did not preheat the dome; buttered the inside and sprinkled with corn meal. Very happy with the result: 8.5 inch diameter, 5 inch high loaf. Baked in 450 oven for 45 minutes with top, then 5 minutes without the top. Internal temp of loaf 198F.

This has become a family favorite.  When I make it I have to share it.  So I have been dividing it into two loaves.

I have made it with stouts and porters.  That adds a lot of flavor.

I don’t want to give it a bad review but my loaf didn’t form any shape whatsoever.   I didn’t have active but used instant yeast and therefore didn’t do premix, but they should have affected it.   Ideas?    The loaf did raise but was more a blob

I’ve been making bread for years spanning the skill and time required.  This recipe is the only one I would make over and over for its ease, texture, and taste.  What is wonderful about this recipe is it is more a hybrid of beer bread and more traditional recipes.  Beer is a great addition because it takes the anxiety out of the inevitable question; “will it rise?”  Mine rises so beautifully it makes my day every time I make it.  Really, a joy to behold.

The bread came out wonderful! Light and fluffy with a great crust. This was my first time making bread and it was very easy. My family loved it. I thought the flavor was a little bland so next time I plan to add some spices.

I made as written. This is a very easy recipe! I bake some kind of loaf bread or English muffins every week.  My boyfriend likes to take sandwiches to work some days and I enjoy something toasted  with almond butter, guacamole, or fruit  preserves for breakfast or an afternoon snack. 

This is a wonderful loaf to serve for a dinner guests.

Great end result that tasted great. However, I must have missed something in the ingredients or preparation. After 2 hrs proofing, my dough was still very wet and messy not allowing me to form the final shape. After about 5 times of adding additional flour and working it in it was sufficient to bake. Overall very good. Thanks for recipe.

surprisingly easy to make, i would make it again simply because it's so... simple, however, the taste is really nothing special.

I followed the recipe to the letter, as I usually do on a first attempt. My yeast was expired, but it seemed to do the job just fine, but after adding the beer - which was still quite chilly - the dough never doubled (not even close). I covered it with the towel for another hour, but no luck. The top was drying out, and the rest stuck to the inside of the bowel. Finished the steps and baked it anyway. Good flavor, a bit dense, and a super crusty outside. Will try again with fresh yeast and room temp beer.

I can't believe it!  I made this bread and it was fantastic.  I am new (very) at this and I must admit I was nervous,  POSITIVE I would do it all wrong!  4  adjustments from reading all the helpful reviews.  Next time I will use Bread Flour,  needs  3-4 hours to rise,  use parchment paper instead of corn meal--it is  cleaner, and yes, it needs a little kneading.  Can;t wait to try it again , maybe with a few additions (garlic, seeds?)  Thank you Chef John

I now make this nearly every other week. Plain, simple, tastes great, and no preservatives!  Wonderful for French toast, grilled cheese, toasted with a bit of butter and strawberry rhubarb jam. Thanks, Chef John!!

Very nice casual loaf I made to accompany the slow cooked Venison Chili I made. Can't wait to make both again and adjust to the families taste! Thanks for the recipe. Revised: Made mini loaves for home made lox, toasted with cream cheese and capers!

Nice bread, great crunchy crust but not particularly fast or easy!  I still had to knead to get all the flour into the dough.

This bread was amazing! I've made bread that was so labour intensive and that didn't even come close to how good and easy this bread was. I used Coors Light and it worked beautifully.

I have made this for a few years and wow it is a hit with everyone.  To make it a little more healthy, I add 1 cup of white whole wheat to the 3 cups of white reg. flour.  Chef John has done this with his ciabatta bread so I felt secure in doing so.  I follow Chef John's recipes as my first go to if he is making something I want to make.

The bread came out okay. It tasted good, but after letting it rise for 2 hours it wouldn’t hold it “loaf” shape, but was flat and took up the entire baking sheet, about an inch high. It wasn’t dense, it was perfect just flat. What can I do to not have this happen again?!

Fast, easy and amazingly delicious. Great bread to bring as a host or hostess gift - its that good and makes a beautiful presentation. It's a larger loaf, but it stayed fresh for several days/one week . I reheated slices in the microwave with a damp wrung lut paper towel for 10-15 seconds each side and it tasted feshly baked. Highly recommend this recipe. Adding to my regular roster of thins I love to make.

Good thing the recipe warns you that the batter/dough will be sticky, cause it was very sticky.  I substituted an Angry Orchard cider and was very pleased with the taste.  Family gave it an enthusiastic "thumbs up."  So easy, I'm considering making mini loaves to include in my Xmas gift baskets this year.

This is a great bread to play around with. I made it the first time just like it said. The next few times I used types of beer then this last loaf I added cheese, onions and garlic. The loaf was gone before bed time.

I love this bread recipe. I substituted 3/4 cup rye flour and 3/4 cup spelt flour and added Caraway seeds.  My husband loves the crust so I shape my loaf to be long and wide but not tall.

I started getting into bread-baking a little over a year ago...I started off very ambitiously (with a live culture sourdough).  The 1 time (of 10) that my loaf turned out, it was delicious.  I've since been experimenting with different yeast breads, and this (no surprise as it's a Chef John submission) is the best I've found.  Although I have yet to perfect the art of shaping a loaf (mine still came out a little flat), the flavor and texture were supreme!

I followed the directions and used a Corona beer.  I think a lager would have offered more flavor and color, but that is what I had.  It did stick to my cornmeal covered cookie sheet for some reason.  However, it tasted delicious.  I have been having trouble with bread rising here in FL, but this did rise.  I will be making this again.

I can't imagine this bread turning out better, even with what I thought would be a fatal mistake. On the second rise, just as I turned the oven on and put the bread in, my phone rang.  I didn't realize, until the buzzer notified me it had reached the default setting of 350 degrees, that I had neglected to turn the oven off. At that point the loaves had already started to cook, so  I bumped the temp up to 425 and continued to bake as the recipe instructed. Instead of one loaf, I made two smaller loaves, one plain and one with toasted sesame seeds on top. Both rose beautifully and had a wonderful taste and texture, especially toasted and slathered with butter the day after baking. I'm not a beer drinker and used Lager Original Amber because it was the only beer at my grocery store that was sold as a single can.  Based on other reviews, I also decided to use bread flour and rapid rise yeast. I'm looking forward to making this bread again and trying Chef John's other recipes.

Have made this several times...changed nothing....my only add for this at all is use a good beer.....I prefer Guinness for it's depth of flavor and adds a unique color to the bread......

This turned out really well and it was my first time baking bread.  I used an Oktoberfest type beer and also used the bread proof setting on my electric oven which worked great.  Big fluffy ball of dough that rose nicely in the oven.  Everyone has enjoyed this and it's also great toasted.

Easy and delicious!  Made it exactly as per the instructions.  The loaf ends up with a beautifully crispy crust and yeasty large crumb inside.  When sliced it makes a wonderful toast with jam and butter.  It perfectly pairs with cold cuts and cheeses when torn into chunks, especially with a fruity wine or cold beer.  I made this today with the German Lentil Soup from this site and it was the perfect combination.  DH loved this so I see more in our future.

I've made this a few times now. It's super easy and always delicious. The only change I made was using a dry cider instead of beer because it's what I had on hand. I'm thinking that next time I might try tossing in some black olives...

Resilient bread - when we make dinner in our house it's all hands on deck. A family of 7 and the kids are all in multiple activities as is myself but we still manage to make home cooked full course meals 3 nights of a work week (it's crazy yes but important to us). As I was making a beef stew and salad, I passed this recipe to my fiancé to make. He followed the directions to a T....in fact so much so that he made the sponge and the rest of the ingredients totally separate because the directions didn't say to put them together (unless you watch the video). When he set them aside for the first rise....I thought WTF to myself and then realized he was doing what he was told (lucky lady I am, huh?). We ended up pouring the sponge over the dough and mixing together. I didn't think it would turn out, but was I wrong!!! It was so crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The crust was really hard when I took it out of the oven and I panicked. Ended up rubbing butter over the top and it was absolutely amazing. Any recipe that we can screw up that badly and still have it turn out, is a keeper in my household!!! The kids dunked it in their Guiness Beef Stew (Thank you Chef John!) and raved about it.

First time making non gluten-free bread and it turned out really great!  Deliscious with butter! I used a dark Wyerbacher, which gave the bread a nice color.  The shape of my loaf was very "artisan" but the texture and taste were great. I can't wait to make this again!

I love this recipe! I've never got the hang of kneading dough, so this one is perfect for me. I usually use whole wheat white flour and Guinness stout, but regular all purpose flour has worked just as well. I keep meaning to play around with it by adding different ingredients, but it's so good on its own.

This is amazing bread- so simple to make and just delicious! This is not like a conventional white bread recipe and Chef Johns video is great to watch so that you know what to expect. I did use bread flour and since I wanted regular shaped bread, I used bread pans which I sprayed with Pam and then dusted with corn meal. Truly a tasty bread.

Some said it would taste like sourdough. But it doesn't. It tastes like beer and it's fantastic! I made one loaf with Pilsner Urquell and white flour and another loaf with Baron (dark lager) and whole grain flour. The Pilsner was better, but they were both fantastic!!!! Best bread of my life! Seriously! The whole family agrees!

Very easy to make, great taste,  I had no trouble with the recipe at all.  Have made it a couple times and only negative comment is not enough salt.  I'll try adding more salt next time.  Working with the dough to shape it  is a little tricky /sticky because it is so moist .  I just  sprayed a little cooking spray on my fingers and it worked great.

I really like making this because it tastes authentic. I can see why this could be a daunting task for oneself because of the yeast and how iffy it can be. Just practice at making this recipe a couple times and with enough dedication, you should be able to pull through.

I like bread recipes that you can start and finish in a day, not all the time but sometimes. This was a delicious loaf and I'm bound to make it again. It's pretty difficult to goof. I don't understand the 'Most helpful critical review'; how is calling it 'inedible' helpful with no suggestions? I have to wonder why Coco made it in the first place.

This is a really easy and good recipe to make. The bread tastes super which is a rarity for homemade bread, that I make anyway. 

I mixed it up by adding lots of herbs and garlic to the dough before proving so as not to affect the yeast.

I did have to add more flour as the original mix was quite wet

Love this bread!! We can't wait to get it out of the oven, when we make it. The only thing we do differently is put it back in the bowl for the second rise, preheat a cast iron skillet and bake it for 30 minutes covered, then uncovered for the last 15 minutes...Fabulous!

It tastes really good and super easy to make. Quick! I suggest that you flatten the loaf a bit so it gets done on the inside. It's a dense bread and outside cooks before inside.

I am a huge failure when it comes to making bread, but this was super easy and delicious!!! The video was helpful in that I always second guess dough consistency when making bread. With  a video to compare it to,  it was perfection! Thank you!

I have to admit to something I rarely do the first time I make something: I changed things just slightly. I used a vanilla porter beer, which is dark and somewhat heavy. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to help "smooth it out". My loaf came out dense, heavy and somewhat crumbly. I was not that impressed, buy I may have to take some of the blame. Will not try this one again, though.

I have made this 2 or 3 times exactly by the directions and it always turns out perfect. There is never any bread left after dinner and it makes a huge loaf. Lots of thanks to the submitter!

Very good, only  1 thing the novice needs to know. Make sure you use a warm/room temperature beer, cold beer will cuase your bread not to rise properly. Try it with guiness beer, pairs well with short ribs!

This is heavenly -  crispy crust and a moist, tender, large-crumb texture inside.  I did add more flour as it wouldn't hold its shape on a sheet pan. I baked it as a boule in a pie tin. Making it again today. Very quick and easy for a yeast bread. Highly recommended. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John. P.S., I used Heineken beer the first time and am using a locally brewed beer today.

It was okay, but it's lacking something and tastes quite flat.   If I make it again, I'll add some herbs , such as fines herbes or dill to give it more oomph.

Added 3Tbsp of homemade pesto and the bread turns out great. Also, found that room temp beer makes the 2 hour rise a little more vigorous

I LOVE this bread.  I've made it twice.  Each time it has been picture perfect with great taste and texture.  I used a mild lager beer which produced a light sourdough flavor.  I followed Chef John's video to the letter.  You can't go wrong with his video instructions.  Today's ample loaf will disappear by breakfast tomorrow.
     Now here it is a few weeks later.  I'm wondering if baking the loaf in an oval clay baker or enamel coated cast iron covered crock would yield a taller loaf.  That would be a better shape for toasting and making sandwiches.

So easy. So basic yet so delicious. 

Mine ended up sticking to my cheap cookie sheet. It was amazing despite that. Use a silicone baking sheet or lots of shortening so this doesn't happen to you.

Thank you so much Chef John.  This recipe is brilliant.  For someone who doesn't cook, the bread has turned out well each time.  My family loves it.

Absolutely delicious.  I don't often make bread, but this recipe took my fancy.  So glad I tried it.  The crust was a little hard when I took it out of the oven, so I followed another reviewers tip and simply covered it with a tea towel as soon as it came out of the oven.  That did the trick.  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe, worked a treat first time. I used New Belgium's Slow Ride beer, nice relatively light and it worked well. The bread as a nice crunch to the crust but not hard and the middle is soft like fresh ciabatta bread. The directions given are perfect, I followed them exactly, measuring all the ingredients and everything worked out.

Amazing...Loved it Chef John thank you so much for this recipe. I added some oregano into the dough before the second rise. I also added some oregano and onions on top half way through the baking. It was tasty. No trace of the beer just good well made tasty bread. So glad I tried it. Thanks again :)

I had my doubts, but it came out of the oven looking exactly like the loaf of bread in the video.  What a great recipe.  It does take a few hours with the rising and baking, but is very simple and the directions are easy to follow.  If you do plan to make it, watch the video.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and it came our perfectly! Beautiful and super delicious. The crust was very crunchy which I love and the inside soft but not doughy. I used plain old Miller Lite beer and there was no beer or yeasty taste at all. The flavor was superb as was the texture. My husband and I both loved it and couldn't stop eating it. This will forever be my go to bread recipe. I doubt I'll ever use my bread maker again. Love you chef John. Keep those recipes coming - you never disappoint!

Easy and super delicious! Since I generally like a touch more salt in my bread, I upped the yeast and salt both to 2 teaspoons each. I also only add 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 cups of flour into the sponge, reserving the rest for shaping the loaf, or to add to texture as needed. I find that using all four cups of flour can result in a drier, denser loaf than I like. Try making it with an oatmeal stout!

Seriously good bread with little to no effort. You just need time to let the dough rise, but you can be doing other things meanwhile. I made this bread with the cheapest full-bodied beer and it was fantastic. I also made it with once with white flour and once with whole wheat--both delicious! I especially love the crunchy outside and soft tender inside. Excellent!!

Very Simple, Good Tasting, I used a hard Irish Cider,
It got huge in the first rising time. 
I also mixed in about a cup of White Aged Cheddar, Can't see it in the finished product but adds a nice Flavor as well
I made it with guinness as well which makes it look more like a rye bread but I turned it into Hot dog Buns. they turned out well.

Easy to make. Delicious. I used a lager beer and unbleached all purpose flour. I made a dip of olive oil with fresh garlic and McCormick Tuscan Seasoning, blended in my Ninja Professional. My wife and sons loved it too. Thanks.

Wow!  Loved this bread!  It's dense and so chewy inside with a wonderful crust outside.  No knead?  That's for me!  Very, very easy recipe and turned out terrific.  Last night I made grilled ham, cheese and green onion sandwiches with it and it took that simple sandwich over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Only giving it four stars bc mine came out flat.  The texture and flavor were great, though.  I followed the recipe but obviously didn't do something right.  This was my first attempt at bread.  What did I do wrong?

Very easy to make - and very quick, too. The result was lovely, tasty bread; sweet with a hint of tanginess from the beer (I used dark bitter beer as that was what I had). The texture was good and it had a nice crisp crust. I followed the recipe as given but with just a bit less melted butter on top. I'm sure I will be making it again, and often!

I have made this several times and not only is it a no kneed bread ,it is a no fail recipe! it is always crusty and looks like an artisan bread. I usually use Michelob Ultra.I even had my daughter who has never made bread bake it a couple times and it still is perfect.

Worth the time it takes to prepare this recipe.  Absolutely delicious. Crunchy crust and soft middle. Great with cheddar cheese added to the dry batter and some herbs!

Extremely easy recipe that turns out great every time I make it. Great crunchy crust, chewy inside and you can experiment with different beers to personalize the taste. So far I've tried using the Shiner Bock Seasonal, and the Karbach Mother-in-Lager, both are great but I think the mother in lager was my favorite. This bread is now a must have on every hunting trip!

I make it into 2 loaves so that they fit in gallon zip lock bags. I normally share one loaf with our wonderful neighbors and we eat the other. It's really good with Sam Adams old fessiwig beer.

This bread is off the charts fantastic.  I am a caterer and made this bread for my business and got rave reviews.  My family also loved it.  I made it two days ago and have another batch proofing right now.  Thanks so much!

I tried this yesterday for Super Bowl .  It was excellent and even the men commented on it.  I was glad to have read the other reviews, as it did look a little flat to me going into the oven but it did rise beautifully.  Great texture and crusty on the outside. I did set the beer out on the counter for about an hour prior to using as I had been advised by our local Parisian baker to do so.  Thanks Chef John, another keeper !

this is a very easy and well textured bread i watched the video and made exactly like chef John said EXCELLENT!!! looked very professinal I was very pleased with the turn out.I also used half bread flour that I had on hand. took some time but well worth it. I toasted a piece not too brown just to a golden look and added honey on top,YUM.
I will definitely make this again,you cant go wrong if you follow directions to a tee.....luv it!!
ps. watch the video it helps if you are unsure about how to make it.

Absolutely wonderful bread!  It makes a ginormous loaf, though. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!), I'm going to try splitting the dough into two smaller loaves.

I rarely change a thing in a Chef John recipe, and this one is no exception! I love this bread! It could not be easier to make and it is so delicious with a soft, delicate texture inside and a nice crusty outside. Though there is no need to change a thing, you certainly can customize this bread by adding your favorite herbs or even some ground flax seed for a health boost. Just start with the basic recipe and have some fun! Thanks Chef John for another fantastic recipe!!

I love this recipe! I make two loves at a time. I also add 1/8 cup ground flaxseed, 1/8 cup linseed & mix in 1 cup whole wheat flour... so I take out 1 1/2 cups white flour. It is moist with a crispy crust.  I freeze 2ond. loaf.  The funny thing is, I don't drink beer but I love to cook with it!

This is awesome. I used Sam Adam's Oktoberfest for the beer.  Next time I'll use room temperature beer instead of cold. I think it would rise a little better that way.

Nice crusty outside, chewy inside.

This was fabulous! I made this a couple of weeks ago to take along to my son's Oktoberfest party. It was a big hit! I made a slight change from the original recipe though. I substituted one cup of all purpose flour with one cup of Spelt flour and added a 1/2 tsp of yeast. The texture was wonderful and the bread was anything but bland. I'll make this again and again!

This was good but not awesome... but in fairness to Chef John, it may have been the pale ale I used.  He does not specify the beer to use and personally there are not that many beers that I like (wine person here)... so I chose the one recommended by my local liquor store proprietor.  It's not bad, just more 'hoppy' than I expected, but plenty flavorful and it has a great texture, especially after it cools... which I highly recommend Chef John's suggestion to cool completely before slicing. We could not resist the aroma so sliced while it was till very warm.  I am looking forward to the rest of the loaf.  You should rry it, it is a good bread.  Good crust, moist crumb, and not at all hard to work with.  You can skip the cornmeal if you use parchment, but do NOT skip the water in the rack underneath, that's crucial.  My husband LOVED it.

I can do a mean soda bread but when it comes to regular soft style bread I think my problem is kneeding (I tend to give it a beat down !)

So when I seen no kneed bread, I knew this was the one for me and it delivered.  Easy to make, and super soft with a nice crust.  If I'd have purchased a bread like this in the store I'd have been well happy.  The best bread I've ever made that's for sure.  It was a winner with the whole family and I will be experimenting with the recipe to maybe mix up the flavours next time.

Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe !

Just came out of the oven!  Bread addict husband couldn't wait.  Still warm, with butter slathered on, he is now in his happy place.  Only difference as far as the recipe was concerned was the lack of corn meal.   None in the house so I used some panko bread crumbs instead.  Wonderful recipe!
Beer, by the way was from a Vermont microbrewery, a hoppy ale, unpasteurized and bought in growlers.  Perfect!

I've never made beer bread before, and this recipe was perfect! I had an extra opened beer to use & (as always) waste not, want not :-) I don't have cornmeal so I skipped that step. Also, I don't have a bread machine or warmer so I didn't get a good rise out of the dough before baking. Came out a bit dense but so delicious! Thanks!

Easy and delicious. I followed the instructions and the bread came out great! I couldn't wait for the loaf to cool completely, I was too excited. Fresh warm bread is the best bread.

This is my first attempt at bread (other than sweet breads) and it was quite easy and turned out perfectly. I paired it with the Slow-Cooker Potato Soup from this site and they made a perfect pair.

This is super easy to put together nd is has an amazing taste and texture. Soft spongy center with a crunchy crust.  And its visually impressive with the splice in the top.

I used 1cup of whole wheat and 3 1/2 cups of white all purpose flour and added a pinch more yeast. Also added rosemary and anise seeds in the dough. The results were amazing! Thank you for sharing

Gooooooood, Very easy to do and very rich in flavor.  I baked one on Sunday and by Tuesday I baked the recipe twice because of special order from members of my husband's family.

Wow,I can't cook. No really .I'm horrible but this bread came out awesome. My dad ate a loaf himself and I'm getting ready to make my 3rd loaf this week.
We like to nosh on it with bread dipping oils for an appetizer.It's so good and easy can't wait to show this off when everyone comes over for easter dinner. Thanks chef John. Nobody in our house will ever go hungry with your bread around!
