A very tasty tuna casserole!
I would recommend you try it...it may become part of your staple menu.
I had to modify my version of this recipe but had near stellar results:
I did not have cream of celery so I used cream of chicken (isn't tuna the 'chicken of the sea?'); and I did not have milk so I used 'A Taste of Thai' coconut milk.  I backed off on the amount of onion (like the flavor of onion, but it is the gift that keeps on giving) while adding 7 ounces of green peas and some grating of cheddar cheese on the eggs.  A fairly easy dish that does not take a lot of time or effort to concoct.  Thanks to chef who contributed it!

Was good but next time I am going to use cream of chicken soup I stead. I also topped mine with cheese and added a few flavored chips to the bread crumb mixture. Over good and my kids ate it without complaint.

Over-all a tasty recipe although next time I would saute the onions first. The onions were still raw even after adding 10 minutes to the cooking time. I also added a sprinkle of cheddar cheese over the eggs. I will definately try it again.

I have never made or even eaten tuna casserole before tonight! I looked up the recipe out of necessity (didn't grocery shop when I should have and I had tuna to work with). I modified this recipe a bit. I added chopped feozen spinach because I saw it in another recipe and I love spinach. I also added grated cheddar cheese because I noticed a commenter who said she sprinkled cheese on top, but I mixed it in with the casserole so the bread crumbs would still be on top. Because I usually don't have condensed soups on hand, I made cream of celery feom scratch with fresh celery, and I'm sure that makes the casserole even better. I was out of mustard powder, so I tried mixing in a bit of turmeric in its place. And I halved the curry powder only because curry is such a strong flavor for me. And I omitted the eggs (I was out, but I don't think I'd include them anyway). The only thing I'll do differently next time is sautee the onions before adding them to the mix so that they don't stand out so much in the finished product. My kids enjoyed it (even my very, very picky six-year-old), so I'll probably double everything except the breadcrumb topping next time, because there was room to make it deeper in my 9×13.  First attempt at tuna casserole was a hit!

I doubled the recipe and added a can of cream of mushroom instead of two can of cream of celery. I love curry, but the curry spice in this, I thought was just too much.

This was really unique and delicious. My changes: cream of chicken (didn't have cream of celery), (1) 7 oz. can of tuna, and added celery salt. Will definitely be adding this to the rotation.

This is a great recipe!  I usually have all the ingredients  on hand, so was a no brainer to try it.  I made it  exactly as the  recipe called for the first time.  But second time, I did saute the onion, but also added 1/2 stalk of diced celery to the saute.  I added peas, because we love them.   next time I may saute some mushrooms too, lol.  The rest was same as first time.  a keeper for sure!

Mine came out a little dry and flavorless, but I think it has potential so I'm going to be tinkering with it.

Loved it!  I'll make a double recipe next time for my family of four - it was gone in 5 minutes.   I used Italian bread crumbs because that's what I had and added a dash of cayenne.

I thought it was delicious. I had to improvise a few things because I didn't have certain ingredients. I didn't have any kind of creamed soup so I made something with heavy cream, corn starch, a bouillon cube, and some onion powder. It turned out surprisingly well. I also didn't have curry powder so I had to make my own from scratch. That was quite easy and it turned out very nice. I think what would make this casserole even nicer would be some chopped veggies, like carrots or peas. I would definitely make this again.

love this tuna casserole, as does the fam (including picky toddler) 
I saute the onions a bit first as I find they don't soften enough in the oven. I also use panko on top.

I loved this recipe. So delicious. It was a big hit with the whole family. The only change I made was to sauté the onions first and I used cream of chicken soup because I had it on hand. Definitely a keeper.
