I have been looking for this recipe for years!  I made this when I was still in high school, and then lost the recipe.  I have also made this with peaches.  Great, great recipe for the summer!

I added 2 Tbsp strawberry syrup instead of flavored gelatin. It was very thick before adding gelatin and had to add a little more 7up. Used 1 packet (1 oz.) Knox unflavored gelatin but will omit it next time. Cornstarch makes it thick enough.  Very good

When I made it 4tablespoons of corn starch was too much for 1 cup of lemon lime soda.  I added more soda to make a full pie. very tastey

Since my husband and Mom are both diabetic, I used Sprite Zero and Splenda.  I also used just a bit of Redi-Whip as I served it, rather than the cool whip.  It was wonderful...especially for a sugar free desert.

I also used Splenda and diet soda. The gelatin mixture was too thick and just sat on top of the pie. It did not get down in between the strawberries. Also, I couldn't really taste any sparkling soda. However, Aa much as I like strawberries, it was still good. I will just adjust the cornstarch next time.

I used one tablespoon of cornstarch.  Think the instructions should read to cook over medium heat "until boiling.  Boil one minute or until mixture turns from white to opaque."  Then when you add your gelatin the mixture will look like a ruby.  Also, the mixture needs to cool before you add it to the pie shell.  (I used a prepared graham cracker crust.)  The mixture cooled in the fridge while I leisurely prepared my strawberries.    Delicious.

First time I've given a review, but this one was worth it!Very delicious. I also cut back a bit on the cornstarch and added more lemon lime soda. I have a wheat allergy so the pie crust that i make usually needs a great filling to jazz it up. This one did the trick!
