I made this using chipotle cheese chicken sausage.  I used a mix of colored peppers and white wine rather than red.  Since my sausage was already fully cooked I browned it and removed it from the pan.  Then I proceeded with the pepper ragout.  After adding the marinara and wine, I simmered the sauce for only about 10 minutes, so the peppers wouldn’t turn to mush.  Then I added back the sausage and heated through.  Very good and with the mix of bell peppers, very colorful.

Great way to use sausage! I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce to add some kick. It is super easy and good for freezing.  Giving it a four because it needed something special to add to bring it up to restaurant quality.

This was a huge hit. So easy to make and I served with some salad and garlic bread. Next time I will make with some homemade marinara but for this try I used our favorite jar sauce. My wife and 5 year old loved it. This will be in our dinner rotation for sure.

I didn't have any diced tomatoes so I just used a can of tomato sauce, which worked fine. I also substituted Italian style chicken sausage as I don't eat pork. I did find that I needed more olive oil, as the chicken sausage is very low in fat. My husband raved about the meal; it was a huge success.

My picky eater husband (you have no idea) told me that this is one of his most favorite dishes I have made for him. Everyone enjoyed it, and it was delicious! A crowd pleaser for sure. The  ONLY thing I did differently was to add the wine in with the onions. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! :)

I used tofu sausage instead. My fiancé (who isn’t a vegetarian) loved it as well! Tons of flavor and fairly easy to make.

I tried this recipe and it turned out great. For the red wine I used a dry red wine. Someone made a comment about it been bland so I added hot sausage as well that gave it a little more flavor. It had even more flavor the second day.

This dish had great flavor. I thought it would be bland due to the lack of spices, maybe the addition of some marinara sauce made up for that.

This is a great dish that's easy to modify.  I used what I had to make this dish.  Instead of the marinara I used Classico Organic Tomato, Herbs & Spices sauce, Isineros Italian ground chicken sausage, and I added some finely chopped mushrooms because my husband is supposed to eat more and hates them (he never knows when I put them with ground meat!).   I plan on  serving it with some Penne Rigate and a side green salad.   Thank you for the recipe!

We love this recipe! Tastes like authentic Italian, makes the house smell wonderful, and even my kids love it! Easily doubles to feed a crowd, and reheats well.

I didn't have sweet sausage and I used hot. I used white instead of red wine and followed the recipe as written except for those 2 ingredients.  There were four of us for dinner and  there was only enough left over for a small portion.  It was fantastic.  A lot of flavor and enough sauce to dip bread in. Guests wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make this again!!!
