I used fresh lime juice and "diet" cranberry juice. This is delicious. I tripled it only because I wanted a bigger drink. My husband keeps sneaking sips.

I'm w/Sarah Jo in that this makes a small "drink".  It barely filled a highball glass 3/4's of the way full, w/additional cranberry juice.  No biggie, just be prepared to adjust (or feel like your doing a cosmo shot) per your own personal preference.  No Triple Sec, so I subbed a little lemon juice instead.  I also used a sparkling cranberry juice as I prefer bubbles in my drinks. Cheers!

This should be named the "classic cosmo" or "original" I had made another recipe before I found this one and it had a lot of unnecessary extra ingredients.  This recipe is PERFECT and it's the one I'm using from now on.  Cheers!

A tad stronger than I would have liked, but easily rectified by additional cranberry juice.

I made these Christmas Eve. They turned out really good. I actually made a pitcher of them and dipped the rim of the glass in  sugar. Everybody wanted more??

I added a little more triple sec, and I used Cran/Cherry juice. 
Try it with the flavored vodkas, and mixed juices until you hit upon your new signature drink.

I thought this was perfect. The only thing I would change is the amount, I would double it.

My(wife's) tastes tend to gravitate towards more sweet and less alcohol. She's essentially a non-drinker.

 I add about 1/4 oz simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar) and beef up cranberry juice a bit. 

1.5 oz vodka, 1/2 oz Triple Sec, 1 oz cranberry juice, 1/2 oz fresh lime juice, 1/4 oz simple syrup.

I Love this "modern" classic cocktail, and I agree with Rainbow Jewels that it's perfect to share with My Girlfriends. :)
