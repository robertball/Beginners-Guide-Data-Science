Wonderful! I made the batch for 12. I was shy about 1/4 lb of fresh beans, but luckily I had one small bag of organic frozen to mix in. It didn't make a bit of difference. I left some of the fresh beans a bit long since it looks so nice. I prepped the beans the day before, then boiled and ran them under cold water before I left for the Thanksgiving dinner. I also made up the oil and garlic mixer and put that in a container to take with us along with the chopped walnuts. Once the turkey was coming out of the oven I sauted the beans in the oil, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder and celery salt, then added the walnuts. The beans heated just enough to keep their crispness. They were delicious and colorful. I had many raves for this recipe. Thanks. I will continue to make this one. Loved the walnuts.

I sauteed the garlic with the walnuts, but otherwise didn't change anything. Very easy to throw together if you've already got chopped walnuts around.

I agree with another reviewer in that this was lacking something. I used pecans instead of walnuts, other than that no changes were made. I found this to be on the bland side so, I added more seasoned salt, some garlic powder and finaly a little butter. It was better with the changes. I haven't decided yet wheather I will make this again. Thanks for sharing though!

Everything is better with bacon, and this is no exception.  I added three strips of crumbled bacon at the end, and it was good.  The kids picked out the walnuts, but the adults liked them.  I put the garlic in with the walnuts.  Next time I am going to saute the beans in the bacon grease instead of using olive oil.

I read the other reviews and was worried that maybe there wouldn't be enough seasoning. So while I was browning the walnuts I added scallions after 1 minute. Then after adding and heating through the rest of the ingredients I tossed the mixture with feta cheese crumbles. The results were very good.

Very good!  Made these on Christmas and added about 3/4 cup white wine to the beans before transfering them to the skillet with the walnuts.  Turned out great.

I used a bag of frozen haricort verts from Trader Joe's. Microwaved and then put into a saute pan with olive oil and butter for a few minutes. Added a little lemon juice. Delicious and easy.

This recipe is simple and quite good however, it could use a little more flavour. Parsley perhaps.

Easy and pretty tasty.  I like the nutty flavor with the beans.  A nice change from almonds.

These were wonderful! I used frozen green beans and didn't cut them. I could have eaten a lot more of these they were so flavorful. The olive oil and seasonings added a nice flavor and the nuts a toasty taste and crunch. Very very good recipe! Thanks Margaret.

I usually prepare green beans with almonds, so this was a nice change.  However, I was expecting a "tad" more flavor from the walnuts.  Burned the first batch and had to throw away, so I may not have toasted the second batch long enough.  I will try this again.

Good side dish, I used pecans instead and it turned out just fine. Lacking a little something, but still yummy.
