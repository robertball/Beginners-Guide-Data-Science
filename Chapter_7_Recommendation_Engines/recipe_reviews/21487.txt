This was a super simple recipe and a definite keeper. The only change I made was to add a little garlic powder. I used my food processor to shred the potatoes and onion. I doubled the batch and made the pancakes small...ended up with about 40 pancakes which was perfect for the party I took them to.

This is the closest recipe on this site for authentic German Latke's like my mom makes.  Sometimes we use breadcrumbs instead of flour or leave out the egg and flour altogether (they still hold together nicely from the starch in the potato).  We sometimes will add spices (my mom likes chili powder or thyme while I prefer oregano, basil and parmesan cheese.)  My latest, delicious addition was some shredded, leftover zucchini I had from making zucchini bread.

Very tasty and extremly easy to make.
instead of chopping onion I grated it with the potato. No biting into large obnoxious chunks of onion that way ;-)

These were excellent!  I halved the recipe (since there are just two of us) and didn't add onions because I was too lazy to chop or grate them.  For onion flavor, I added onion powder.  Also, I grated the potatoes into a bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration then wrung them out in a dishtowel to remove moisture.  They held together very well and were great served with sausage, biscuits, eggs & gravy.  What a yummy breakfast!

Yum yum, I've been making these for years without flour.   Making one large cake is easier, just pour it all in the frying pan.   I use a bit more oil to aid the bottom to crisp.  Cooking covered 15 to 20 minutes each side over medium heat also insures the potato in the middle is done. Upon flipping I add another tablespoon or two of oil to cook the other side crisp. It's manageable to flip if cut in quarters by using a firm spatula. My family does not like these unless they are crispy, crisping really ups the flavor and adds texture.  Definately serve with a dollop of sour cream, I like the green onion garnish idea as well.

We have always used leftover mashed potatoes for potato pancakes. This recipe is very much like ours. I have put corn in them.

At the restaurant where I work we put a poached egg on top of one of these with a cheese sauce on top!  We do some with a slice of tomato too, very yummy!

Altho the mixture needed to be seasoned, they were delicious. I also used my food processor which was a huge time saver. My potato ricer served as a great tool to squeeze out the excess water. Served them with applesauce and sour cream. Thanks Judy!

Not bad, needs more seasonings.  Next time we will have to shred the onions and used 3 different types of onions.  Been dreaming about making a filet mignon napolean with them.

Thanks for posting this recipe, my family has been making these for years and we still love them. Note for "Cherry" the recipe needs the egg and flour to bind it together. Sqeeze some of the water out of the potatoes before adding anything to them, them add the rest. After you place the potatoe pancake in the frying pan gently press it down with a fork like a hamburger pattie to cook through. Hope this helps, it's a great recipe and don't be afraid to add cheese, bacon bits, etc. It's definately great just as it is. Thanks again

FINALLY! A true and authentic recipe of German potato pancakes! You have to shred the potatoes so that they turn into a thick liquid "dough"....I'd only use one egg and instead of flour, use some oats (they help to absorb the liquid and for crispier pancakes). Add a little nutmeg! Traditionally served with apple sauce! You find them around Christmas time at every Christmas market!!

Shred the potatoes extra fine.  After the potatoes are shredded you dry them with a kitchen towel by putting them inside and twisting the towel.  This will get rid of the excess water in them.  Beat the eggs until they are frothy then add the potatoes that have been dried to the eggs mixing them well.  .Then add 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise to the recipe (this is the secret my Mutter taught me).  Skip the  flour as you don't need it with this recipe. If the recipe seems to watery skim the excess water off the top with a paper towel. I don't add salt to the recipe instead I salt them as they fry.  I also add a bit of paprika to the mix.  If you're using this as a side dish then top with sour cream.  As a desert don't add the onions and then  top with applesauce (although I can remember eating the pancakes with applesauce along with pork dishes).  wunderbare

Almost like my german grandmother used to make. She used to grind the potato and onion using an old hand crank grinder. A food processor makes this task so much easier. We sometimes add green onion and finely diced ham to the mix. So good!

This was a great recipe!  I served these as a side dish with quiche for dinner.  The outside of the pancakes came out nice and crispy, and the insides were slightly softer.  Try this recipe!

I've made these pancakes for 37 years.  My Polish husband loved them.  I never measured anything I put in.  I use the least amount of flour possible to help bind them.  I, personally, never liked tasting the flour.  This has always been a favorite Saturday or Sunday breakfast.

I used instant mashed potatoes and just used the suggested serving per person of instant, instead of the number of actual potatoes called for in the recipe. Worked like a charm.

They were really flavorless and the shredded outside bits kinda felt funny going down. I tried adding garlic powder to the last few and that helped. They were also really heavy compared to the ones im used to. Probably wont make them again.

Just now tried them first time. Absolutely excellent. Just single layer and thinly spread out in the pan (they don't break apart when turning) makes them very light and very digestible for a sustaining breakfast. A real discovery. Thanks

I made these tonight! Very easy to make, I thought I doubled the batch but had to add another two eggs and they cooked up just beautiful and actually stayed together! I used my food processor to shred the potatos and onions then I squeezed it all out by hand (really need to invest in some cheesecloth!) For a husband who is not too fond of potato pancakes, he said these were the best he has had!! Thank you for an awesome recipe! This is a definate keeper! :)

Made these with Cheesy Garlic Chicken from this site.  My son ate 4 potato pancakes and1/2 of a piece of chicken.  He absolutely loves them!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Follow the recipe as written, you can't go wrong!

These were pretty good.  We had them topped with sour cream and green onions.  Next time I will definitely add more seasoning; they were a little bland for my taste.

Delicious!  We added some garlic salt and creole seasoning for some spice and it was so good.  My husband loved them.  I put the oil in the pan to fry them, but the first few pancakes used most of the oil and by the end the pan was only lightly greased and they still turned out great:  Moral of the story, No need to fry them in oil, Pam would work just fine!

OMG this recipe is so delicious! I made it last week and my husband loved it!  He even to go 3 pancakes to work.  When I mixed all the ingredients together I also added  1 teaspoon of salt and pepper to season the potato pancake.  I made mine how I would usually make pancakes, I sprayed a little oil on the skillet on medium high heat. Then I added a spoon full of potato pancakes.  It came out crunchy and very tasty. Definitely my choice of breakfast.  Will make more soon. Thanks for the recipe....

Instead of shredded potatoes try with finely grated. That would be polish way. Very yummy! I eat it with sour cream or strawberry jam, but I heard that pople eat it with just sugar too.  http://www.bestpolishrecipes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=72

My Polish boyfriend told his mother she should come over to our place for dinner and I'd make potato pancakes. Not only had I never cooked for his mother before - I'd never even had a potato pancake before! I found this recipe and it seemed easy enough. I conned him into buying me a food processor for the potatoes. Not having the food processor would have made a very easy, simple recipe into a very long, tedious one. This turned out great! I used sweet onions, so they added a nice flavor. His mother compared them to a local Polish restaurant's pancakes. She said they were as good, if not better. It could have just been lip service, but everyone went back for seconds (and thirds!) so I'm pretty sure they were impressed! Thanks!

Beautiful appearance!  Squeezing out all the water is definitely a reason to keep in shape, use those free weights!  Good flavor but I added more onion than the recipe states.  Absolutely need to have the oil really hot!  As has been mentioned previously, make small pancakes, flatten them with the spatula.  The recipe calls for just a few ingredients, and that contributes to the down-home appeal of these latkes.

Good potato pancake recipe.  Reminiscent of my mom's recipe handed down by her mother from Germany.  Just need to get the ratio of potato to egg right, otherwise they end up like hash browns.  Don't forget to make apple sauce for them.  Found a great recipe for the sauce on here called, "Delicious Apple Sauce".

I enjoyed these but not equal to the amount of work.  Not sure why, but the cooking didn't seem right.  Too much oil?  Too much time?  edges burnt yet middle damp (at least when my husband made big ones)

I grated the potatoes and onion -- btw, grating potatoes is WORK ;) An unappetizing batter sure makes a very delicious pancake! Cooked a little longer than suggested only because mine were pretty thick. We had them for breakfast; eggs over easy and a side of sour cream for the pancakes.

Loved these! Tasted like the ones I grew up with. I had to double the recipe to feed our family. I cheated and used pre-shredded rehydrated potatoes because it was easier, but I followed the measurements for it all and they were great. Thanks- my kiddos loved them!

Hi, I am German and the correct way with the onion is to be shredded together with the potatoes. The flavor of the onion blends better this way. As a child I used plain sugar as topping and still love it this way today. Normally applesauce is used but also delicious topping them with smoked salmon.

I have been making latkes for 25 years and this recipe is the best one I've ever found. I read the reviews and only added one egg tonight and I had to use a few more tablespoons of oil in the cast iron skillet. I used the food processor as others suggested. After processing the potato and onion together, I put the mixture in a clean dishtowel and squeezed out the moisture before adding the egg and flour. Best latkes ever. Thank you for this deceptively simple and delicious recipe. If I would have septupled the recipe we still would have eaten them all in one sitting!! We had them with sour cream and applesauce. They were perfect.

I used a food processor too and ground up everything. I did add a touch of garlic for just a touch of flavor. These were good fried in canola oil for a lot less fat and I also soaked the potato in some water for a little less starch.

very easy to make.  By reading the ingredients I knew it would be bland so I tweaked it.  I added garlic powder, some parmesan cheese & cheeder cheese.  It fried up beautifully and kept it's shape nicely.  Personally, I did not like this and I can't say that I will make again.  Thx.

A very good recipe.  I like to grate the onion alternating with the potatoes and squeeze out any excess moisture to help them brown evenly.

I thought this was a good recipe that is reasonably easy to make. The pancakes taste pretty good, however, the potatoes I used were really watery, so the consistancy wasn't exactly what I was expecting and kind of hard to work with. Overall, I would most likely make these again, though my husband wasn't that impressed.

This is really excellent... I've used the "Simply Potatoes" by Northern Star.  They do the grating for you.  Great flavor and simplicity.  Thanks for a really super recipe.

They were ok. I found them to be bland. Added alot of garlic salt and that made them taste better. Although they were not a big hit for us it was still a very easy recipe to make. Thanks for sharing

I used olive oil through the whole thing and added one clove of garlic. Like any potato dish, adding salt to it adds so much more flavor. I added extra salt on top in the end and it tasted great!

This is almost the exact recipe I use, my mother taught this to me when I was young, that was long ago, and I have been making my potato pancakes this was ever since. I no longer use measurements but just toss eerything together and it comes out great,  One thing so not finely grate the potatoes, use a grater that has large holes and make the potatoes a little stringy,  yum. I serve them with sour cream but  many like them with apple sauce.

I made my potato pancakes much thicker than I imagine you're supposed to.  I wish the recipe had specified how thick to make them, as mine were not done in the middle and I had to continue to bake them in the oven for 10 minutes at 400.  I added paprika, onion salt and garlic powder to the mixture and I think these would have been rather bland had I not.  The outside was very crispy, DB and myself both enjoyed them with ketchup! I will continue to make these but with modifications.

Yum Yum Yummy! Reminds me of the German fried potatoes I grew up eating. I added a little garlic and onion powder and did 1/2 flour, 1/2 breadcrumbs and served with fried ham and bean soup. Delicious.

These are so super yummy! I had to half the recipe because it was only 2 of us and it was still a little much…but boy are they yummy! I dont think ill ever go back to making regular hashbrowns. They were quick and easy. I did have the shredded potatoes sit in cold water for a bit so they would not turn orange or what have you. Will be making these again!

This morning we decided we wanted some potato pancakes, as we already had some potatoes cooked, and didn't want to deal with a fussy recipe. And this was just the ticket. We didn't want to make as much as the recipe suggests, so we used two potatoes, a quarter of an onion, and added just a touch of half and half to the batter for texture. We cooked them on a stovetop griddle, and they came out absolutely perfect. We didn't have any applesauce, but we mixed a little candied ginger purée with some apricot-pineapple jam, and also used Trader Joe's Greek-style yogurt as topping. We also made a quick scramble with fresh, home-grown bell peppers, and enjoyed the perfect breakfast! Thanks so much for this wonderful and easy recipe.

oh my goodness are these good. I shredded a onion in with the potato to avoid biting into a onion chunk. I also added some galic powder for a little extra kick. I recommend putting these on paper towels after they come off the frying pan because they do soak up oil. I paired mine with eggs and ketchup and was set to go. love this recipe.

Loved these.  The recipe reminds me of the potato pancakes a German friend used to make for me (this was before I realized that if I wanted something specific to eat, I could just make it for myself--yes, I was young and stupid).  For the first course, I dot them with hot sauce.  For dessert, slather them with applesauce.  If I have the time, I'll soak the shredded potatoes in water, drain and give 'em a whirl in the salad spinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm sorry to say but I didn't much care for this recipe. I might try it again and modify it a bit. I found that the potato soaked up so much of the oil that they didn't get very crispy.

I changed it a little.  We are not real big on onions, so I replaced it with dried minced onions.  I added both italian flavored bread crumbs, and some flour to keep them together better.  And I used a garlic and sea salt grinder.  They came out great!!  My husband had 3, and he said he never liked potato pancakes.

This is a great recipe, except I have always seen it with leftover mashed potatoes.  That way it is very quick in the morning when running late.  Plus my mashed potatoes are already seasoned with garlic, cheese or whatever sounds good, so I can save a lot of time in the morning!

Very tasty. Instead of cooking them in oil I added a bit of butter directly to the mixture and then cooked them on a flat top (electric skillet. They turned out crucnhy and completely done. I will make this again.

This recipe is more like my mom's recipe. I usually will grate my potatoes and onion. (sometimes will shred but does change texture)When I grate or shred, I will drop in strainer to get rid of liquid. Will fry them in shortening and serve them with sour cream or sugar. Hummmmm!!!

I make these for sunday morning, it's my Husbands favorite. But I use a little salt in the graited potato and onion and let them drain some of their liquid off before adding the rest of the ingredients, it makes for a crispier potato cake

Just made these using this recipe and they taste just like mom and grandma used to make. We eat them as a meal with plenty of sour cream!

OK, I broke my "cardinal" rule of not modifying a recipe when I try it for the first time.  I added only maybe 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion, omitted the flour, and also added 3 Tablespoons of mayo (as I saw in another recipe), and a 15 oz can of corn, well drained.  I used the ready-made 20 oz package of shredded Hash brown potatoes from the refrigerator section (Simply Potatoes).  Mixed everything and it was REALLY wet and loose and I was afraid that it would never hold together.  I formed it into 4 large patties about 5 inches in diameter and one inch thick on a heavily buttered pizza pan that fits on my gas grill.  Covered it tightly with foil and put on the grill over medium-high setting for 10 minutes, removed the foil and flipped them, then loosely re-covered with foil for 10 minutes.  My fear that they wouldn't hold together was completely unfounded.  I think the secret to having them stay together is to not try to do ANYTHING until the first side is well browned.  They came out looking really great, but they were bland.  I think I should have used a whole onion, as the recipe states, and I don't think the mayo did anything significant except add fat calories.  I'm going to try this recipe again, only sticking more closely to the instructions as written.  Very aesthetic results, just need to jazz up the flavor a bit for my taste.  Thanks for a solid recipe, will definitely be going back to this one again, especially to do on the grill for Summer cooking.

I kind of used this as a base- I used left over potatoes from last night, small potatoes quartered, with olive oil, rosemarry, basil, garlic and salt cooked in tin over the bbq.  I smased them, and added 2 eggs, a small onion finely chopped, grated cheese, and pancake mix, and water.   man, they turned out really good!

Excellent. First time making them. I too have many memories of these growing up and this recipe was just right. I added grated cheddar and garlic powder. Cut the pepper to 2 pinches and that was just right. These need the pepper though. I have to have salt with my potatoes and it tastes better cooked in then added after so I kept the salt the same. I did not squeeze the potatoes well enough after rinsing but the only thing it affected was the splattering. Now I have itchy wrists and a messy stove. I just bought a mandolin to make these and it was well worth the $25.99. Thank you.

Tasty, but had too much flour for my liking. And it wasn't spiced enough, but it was good.

Made these with a few left over Michigan Jumbo Potatoes. This was the first time I bought that type and found they were very bitter by themselves. However this recipe worked wonders! Very simple and tasty!

I love these.  They are good with any meal.  I even made them along side burgers for a change from french fries or chips and my family loved them.

My family has been making these for ever. Personally I prefer them with a bit more onion but that's just me. These are one of my absolute favorites and though the sour cream or applesauce are both good, I prefer them with just a lot of butter and salt. A very good pairing for them are some nice sage sausage links. Also, I've seen a few people say that they use leftover mashed potatoes and those are just as good,  as a tip though you can also use leftover spaghetti squash in place of the potatoes. They turn out a little sweeter but are still delicious......hmmm....I do have some leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge.......

Not bad, but the flour made it taste a little starchy to us. Also, we cooked them on medium heat for about 8 minutes to crisp the outside and cook the inside as it was still kind of raw after cooking for 4 minutes.

These are pretty good. They taste just like my moms but don't quote brown up the same way. We also had to make the grating size a bit large then the smallest.

I didn't shred them.  I'm lazy and that takes too much time.  Mashed is the way to go for those who are lazy like me.  I also added garlic, herbs, and French Onion Dip.  They were good.

I made these one night for my husband and me. They tasted strongly of onion and not really anything like potato pancakes I have had in the past. My husband, who has never had potato pancakes, told me that he thought they were good however. I will try this recipe again because he asked me to; I will try less onion next time.

We really liked it.  I think garlic powder is a good addition, but the simplicity is excellent.  Mom is almost 90 and these are a lot like the ones her Mom made.  We just had syrup and some butter on them.
