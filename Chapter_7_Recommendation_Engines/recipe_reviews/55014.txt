I left out the sweet potatoes and the fatback, and it was still the most tender beef I've ever had!

I've made crockpot variations of this a couple times now. With some modifications, this is -delicious- and not swimming in fat. I cut the salt by 2/3 and used a fraction of the fat--no fatback, no shortening, no olive oil and only 2 tbsp butter for the garlic--and a smoked ham hock instead of the bacon. Fabulous! I also add 3-4 lbs of cut up vegetables about two hours before its done. Carrots and potatoes, usually, but fennel, chestnuts, and winter squash are good, too. The addition of vegetables might require more salt and possibly a little extra water.

the brisket tasted great.I followed the recipe and think the fat back is not needed and the dipping sauce was not that good. A creamy horseradish sauce for prime rib would be better.Doubble the sweet potato everyone raved about the flavor the marinade gave them.

This was ok.  It wasn't nearly as flavorful as I expected it to be, and the garlic flavor just seems to disappear.  I added one onion, cut into eight pieces along with the sweet potatos and left off the fatback and reduced the butter by half.  It is still quite heavy on the grease.  Thanks for the recipe to try, but this one probably won't be one we make again.

This brisket is the best I have ever had.  My family loved it as much as I did!  I have to admit, though, I was very skeptical about marinating the meat in coffee, and the amount of the spices, but the final outcome is so delicious!

Maybe it was the meat from Sams Club, or maybe it was that I didnt use the fatback (whatever that is) or I didnt marinate all night just most of the day. This was tough...I counldnt cut it. The flavor was good, and it smelled good while it cooked. I might try this with a roast...maybe....

This was the MOST flavorful, tender brisket we've ever tasted.  Do not be detered by the amount of garlic...the first hour or so in the oven it will make your eyes water...but it cooks down to a wonderful, mellow flavor.

Absolutley a Keeper. As previous reviews suggested, I eliminated the shortening and fatback. Used 1 stick of butter to saute the garlic. The meat was very tender. The sweet potatoes were great. Added some fennel bulbs the last hour.You won't be disappointed with this one.

I did not use the fatback nor the shortening. (I have a non-stick roasting pan). This is a LOT of garlic. The sweet potatoes did not taste that great after roasting with the meat and went uneaten - they were very salty, from the bacon I'm assuming. We didn't care for the dipping sauce. As someone else mentioned, a creamy horseradish sauce would probably work better.

I made this along with a Turkey for Thanksgiving this year. I put about 2 cups of BBQ sauce the last 2 hours as it was cooking.  It was the most tender meat that I have ever tasted. Everyone asked for the recipe and it will definitely be part of our Holidays to come!

Wow, this recipe turned out amazing! The meat was very tender and flavorful. I also did not use the extra fatback because the brisket I bought already had a good layer of fat on it. My sweet potatoes turned out extremely salty, but I think that was due to the use of sea salt (even though I only used 1/8 cup). Also, I ended up only needing 1lb. of bacon.
