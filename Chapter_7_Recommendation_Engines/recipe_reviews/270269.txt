This was really good! I've never made or had smothered cabbage before, so I was up for something new tonight. This fit the bill! I used the full can of Rotel, since a half can didn't seem like enough. I also cooked it an extra 10 mins, since some pieces of cabbage weren't quite done yet. Perfectly seasoned with just a hint of heat. A great one pot meal for a busy night!

I do keto and love trying new cabbage recipes. I used ground Italian sausage. I also tossed in a couple of handfuls of fresh mushrooms and used the whole can of rotel. I sautéed the chopped onion and bell pepper in my instant pot. I did everything the same except after tossing  the tomato’s over the cabbage, I gave it a good stir and pressure cooked it for 2 minutes and done a quick release. It is very good! Will make again.

Yum! I love pork and cabbage but this arrangement was new for me. I did make some minor modifications - I used the whole can of tomato and pepper, doubled the Creole seasoning and added two chopped apples to complement the spiciness of the seasoning increase. Yum!

Loved it!  I like a little more heat so I used diced tomatoes with hahabaneros. Other than that, wouldn’t change a thing!

I made the mistake of using my garden tomatoes and banana peppers instead of canned with chilies- very bland. Seasoning wasn’t sufficient.

Comforting on a cool evening.  This was easy and quick to put together on a weeknight after a full day of work.  As suggested by some, I did use a full can of Rotel and it really needed it, in my opinion.  I used 1# of ground sirloin and half a package of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage for the meat. Two other family members gave a thumb's up.  Not too high on calories or carbs either.

Delicious! Made it with the ingredients listed (couldn't find straight ground pork so I used country pork which was like sausage) but also added 3 chopped strips of bacon.  Between the pork,  bacon and creole, a tad salty but not a reason to knock the recipe.  Will make again.
