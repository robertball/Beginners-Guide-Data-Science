I didn't care for this at all.  Way too much Ranch dressing and so it tasted REALLY strong.  Also the topping was so thick on the bread (large french bread split in half) that while the edges of the bread were starting to burn under the broiler the topping was barely even warm.  If you simply must try this recipe I would suggest less ranch dressing and using dressing that is at room temp. so it warms more easily.  Perhaps you could also cover w/ foil and cook for a while & then put under the broiler for a few minutes.

I didn't like the combination - I think the use of cheddar cheese is not the best choice. If I make this again I'll change the type of cheese to offset the tanginess of the ranch.
