Excellent. Quick, easy and flavorful. (I skipped the tofu.) My boyfriend from India made the following modifications for more authenticity:  After heating oil in pan, add 1/2 t. cumin seeds. Heat for 30 seconds, stirring. Then add 6 curry leaves and 2 t. ginger-garlic paste.  Stir for 30 seconds. Then add onion, 1 t. garam masala, 1 t. chili powder and 1 T. curry powder. (no curry paste required)  I followed the recipe similary except that I added about 1/2 cup water after putting in the chick peas to create a thinner consistancy.  We both loved it served with basmati rice.  Next time I may add some chopped tomato.

I noticed there were no reviews from someone saying they are Indian.  So here I am.  I tried this out because I was curious about the creamed corn base - all of my curries use tomatoes.  I used the ingredients requested with 3 exceptions.  1 - garlic salt 2 - a can of diced tomatoes because the corn started sticking 3 - homemade paneer instead of tofu - but only because I had none, I've used tofu in curry before & as other reviewers have said, you need to brown it first with a little bit of oil, then take it out of the pan while you move onto the onions.  I always put the cheese/tofu in last so they stay whole. In regards to curry paste.  I noticed quite a few who were unable to use it reviewed a few years back.  In the past 2 or 3 years, most major grocers carry curry paste - it's different from curry sauce.  Also, other reviewers have mentioned this, the brand makes a HUGE difference.  I only use Patak's.  I'm always trying different brands because I like to think of myself as a lover of shortcuts - curry paste is one of them.  I've used Patak's faithfully ever since I left my parents and missed authentic South Indian cooking (spicy flavorful & spicy hot).  I used a medium hot paste because I'm not sure how much my 18 month can do - it must have been just right because she inhaled it as did my 5 year old. As far as measurements go - I don't use them. The beauty of curry is it's YOUR special blend. I'm writing home about this one!

I have never made an indian dish that tasted so authentic! Just as good as anything I would get at the restaurant. While sauteeing the onions I added 1/2 tsp of garam masala and 1/2 tsp of ground cumin which I think boosted the flavor dramatically. I followed the recipe exactly and added some boiled potato and cauliflower. I served it with basmati rice and it came out wonderful! Very mild also, as I have a very hard time eating spicy indian cuisine, but definitly not lacking in flavor! I'm very grateful for this wonderful recipe.

This was an excellent dish.  I baked my tofu at 425 for 20 mins (cubed) prior to adding it to the pan, I like tofu a little more "cooked" than it usually gets in dishes like these. The tofu would also be excellent fried if fat content is not an issue.  I served it with some somosas and another spicier dish (both recipes I found on this site)and my guests couldn't have loved it more.

This is one of my family's favorites and I have made it dozens of times. I don't like curry powder but curry paste is much different! I always get the mild kind which is excellent. Others who found this bland must not have used the paste. I have made this for lots of folks and they all loved it. I always use sweet potato(partially cooked already so it doesn't take long), carrots, lima beans and broccoli and sometimes leave out the tofu and spinach if I don't have them.  Also try it with tempeh. It is fast, easy and great!

I followed the recipe as is except that I added a diced tomato. Make sure you buy extra firm tofu (the kind for stir frying), otherwise it will fall apart when you are cooking the curry.

This curry is delicious! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is easy to make and tastes great! The creamed corn gives it a nice sweetness and consistancy.  All of the ingredients are easy to come by with the exception of the curry paste.  I advise going to an asian or indian market - they have a much better selection than the average grocery store.  I also advise anyone else that reviews this recipe to learn the difference between curry powder and curry pastes ;)

This is a really great quick, healthy and filling recipe.  I did not add rice, but ate it on its own.  I also followed advice from another reviewer and baked the cubed tofu at 425 for 25 - 30 min (putting alittle nonfat cooking sray on dish and tofu).  I have now found the best way to make tofu!  Yum.

Very good and easy. The only time consuming part was washing the fresh spinach, so next time I'll use frozen spinach. I added a cooked sweet potato, and it was great! Using the curry paste was so easy I may never go back to powder. The flavor of the paste also seemed fresher and more authentic. My husband loved it.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and cooked the tofu in a 425 degree oven for 30 mins.  I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes and fresh garlic.  I threw in a few more spices including tumric and cummin.  This was so quick and easy and tasted great.  You really couldn't even taste the creamed corn.  However, I would suggest reading your cans carefully, because lots of creamed corn has too much added sugar.  I went with the can with the lowest sugar content (as there is already enough natural sugar from the corn).

This recipe will vary greatly depending on the kind of curry paste used.  If you want this to be really spicy and fun, use THAI red curry paste.  I used an authentic Indian red curry paste from a local Asian grocer and was very pleased with the outcome. 

I used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  I didn't find it necessary to add additional salt.  Curry paste is pretty high in sodium.  I would HIGHLY recommend pan frying your tofu first as this will add to the texture and help the tofu hold up when it's combined with the sauce.  I think steamed cauliflower would be a great addition to this recipe.  

Served over basmati.  Really tasty.  Everyone loved it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Instead of creamed corn, I used regular canned corn and added some soymilk and butter.  Skipped the basil, instead garnished with cilantro.  Curry powder worked fine too.  It's going into regular rotation!  Thank you!

This is the first recipe I have not liked from this site. I'm very surprised because it has alot of my favorite ingredients. Just by the smell of it I could tell I wasn't going to like it. I tried so hard to enjoy it and eat it, but I just couldn't!  I'm upset I wasted all that food.

This is delicious!  I gave this recipe four instead of five stars because I think as it stands, it's a four star recipe.  Make a couple of substitutions though, and you've got a winner!  To start with, we made our own chili paste using 3 cloves of garlic (minced), 1 tsp fresh ginger root (grated), 2 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp curry powder, and 1 chopped hot pepper (use as much or little as you like depending on how spicy you like it.)  If you make your own chili paste, make sure you omit the garlic powder, b/c this is garlicky enough!  Make sure you press the tofu thoroughly, and if you don't want yucky mush tofu, brown it first.  This isn't strictly necessary, but for best results and a "meaty" texture, cut the tofu into triangles and pop into the freezer until the edges are just frozen.  Then pop them directly into a heated skillet with some oil without bothering to defrost them.  That's my favorite way to prepare them. :)  We also used fresh basil instead of dried.  Deelish!

This is so fast, and so good. The creamed corn is some sort of secret weapon. I think the outcome probably depends a lot on the curry paste you use. We have a really hard time finding prepared paste around here, so I usually just make my own...2 tablespoons indian spices (a mix of whatever you have/like: tumeric, mustard seed, corriander, cumin, cayenne, etc), a clove of garlic, a half inch piece of ginger, a tablespoon of either vinegar or oil (depending on how much fat you're interested in). Whiz together in the blender or in a spice grinder.

This was very good.  Had it been a little bit *less spicy* it could have been like my favorite Indian restaurant.  I added extra gram masla, red cayanne, and cumin.  But, it was delicious and very, very easy to put together.  I didn't use spinach, tofu or the basil.  Didn't have, but I don't think it mattered.  I also used fresh crushed garlic instead of the powder.  My DH liked also.  I might make again, but with so many others to try, I might move on to another.  Thanks for the post!

Fantastic!  I did not use tofu or curry paste but did follow suggestions made by another reviewer.  Heat oil, add 1/2 t cumin, the onions, 1 t garam malsa, 1 t chili powder and 1 T curry.  Proceed with everything else as written.  I added cooked sweet potatoes and it was great!

Good recipe - I didn't have the curry paste.  I used 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 7 whole cloves, 2tsp. turmeric, and 2 green cardamoms (opened).  I only had corn niblets so I added sour cream and cornstarch to  the curry.  I used chopped frozen spinach.   It turned out great.

I thought this was simple, healthy, and delicious!  I also baked my tofu for a bit prior to adding it.  It was so easy to make a smaller serving too!  Nummy!

We couldn't even finish this, and I love curry.  The problem might have been my fault.  I didn't have curry paste, so I used curry powder, and I used a whole tablespoon.  It was overpowering.  I thought it still had potential, and I thought about making it again with the curry paste, but then I decided I couldn't stomach another go at the recipe.

This was very good and adaptable to taste, my b/f never had curry and I've never cooked it before.  I didn't have curry paste but did have curry powder, and I omitted the tofu.  I added just a little bit of left over chopped bell pepper.  Next time I will add some diced tomato, it was very good, and even my b/f loved it, and he is a bit of a picky eater.

Excellent! I agree with other commenters' suggestions to use extra firm tofu and bake it (cubed) at 425 first, although I only did it for 15 minutes rather than 25.

The recipe was fantastic.  Halfway through cooking I discovered my tofu and spinach had both been in the fridge way too long and were no longer edible. I substituted cauliflower and fresh chopped tomatoes and dinner still turned out great.  This one goes in the recipe box.

I used frozen spinach and fresh garlic. It was delicious. I will be making this regularly and will experiment with adding other veggies.

This was an extremely easy, very tasty dish.  I whipped this up in no time after work, and it turned out great.  I did bake my tofu first, as some of the other reviewers had reccomended, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for this quick healthy recipe bellacoola!

Very good recipe, I really liked the way the heat of the curry was offset by the sweetness of the cream corn.  This time, I added red potatoes, carrots, and yellow squash.  I thought it would be nicer if the curry was offset more with sweeter vegetables, so next time, I would like to try sweet potatoes and maybe more carrots. Also, next time I'd like to try fresh garlic instead of the powder.  I served this over rice.

Great. I didn't have curry paste, like some others, but I just used the reviews and whatever was in my kitchen. I substituted chicken for the tofu and regular corn with some cream since I didn't have creamed corn. Worked great.

We browned the tofu before adding it to the rest of the mixture and I must say, it was yummy over rice. Mmmm.

I made this last weekend and my husband loved it!  I added some sliced carrots and cooked them with the onions.  I left out the tofu. We ate it with nan!  *I found the curry paste at and Indian store.

Tastes so much better than it looks!  Used red thai curry paste, frozen spinach and omitted the tofu.  It was a very easy, tasty dinner; served with a fried egg on top for protein - yum!

Wow!  This was tops.  I browned up some ground turkey with the onions and skipped the tofu.  I already had a bag of chickpeas (still sitting in their lovely subtle broth) in the pressure cooker so when the time came to add those I loaded them on along with a cup of the broth.  I kept adding the broth as it cooked to keep it creamy as it kept drying up (my electric skillets fault?)  Anyway, by the end I used up almost all the broth and topped it off with a bag of frozen spinach.

Loved this. Baked the tofu as others suggested. Next time I will brush the tofu with some of the curry paste or marinate it first. Very good and not spicy so my mid-western kids liked it, too :)

I've never made curry before. As it is written, this recipe is a 4/5. With a little tweaking, it would be a 5/5. Having read none of the reviews, I put it together pretty much as written. When I make this next time, I'll bake the tofu before adding to the mix. Very forgiving recipe. I used onion, frozen corn, 2 Tb curry powder, minced garlic, black beans, extra firm tofu, extra spinach and basil. The corn added a nice sweetness. I let it cook for awhile to cook off some of the extra water from the tofu. This was fun & easy. Thanks for sharing

What attracted me to this recipe was how quick and easy it was.  It took minimal amounts of effort.  I was a little weary of how it was going to taste because it's quite different from most meals I cook...but I was pleasantly surprised.  Even my bf who was more sceptical than I (because of the tofu) admitted he liked it and would even have it again.  I really liked what the spinach added to the dish and I will make this again.  I give this recipe a 4 out of 5 because it's tasty, easy, fast with minimal clean up...but not a 5 because it wasn't a "wow! omg! This taste fan-friggin'-tastic!"

I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not, but this was so good he ate it up! I will be making this again and again. I did find the mixture slightly thick so I thinned it out with a little vegetable broth served over rice and topped with some chopped peanuts! YUM

This was really good, more a 4 1/2 stars...I didn't have cream spinach, so I used a little vanilla soy milk...what can I say had to make a quick call....thought sweet, liquid should work...and it did.  Also added some cauliflower in with the corn.... 15month LOVED the tofu (which I fried in lowfat cooking spray).... served with basmati - everyone asked for more....  Great Vegeterian dinner for non-vegeterian family.  ALSO use real spinach....fill up your sink with cold water wash it that way, salad spin it and just chop keep the stems..... fresh spinach is so much better then frozen.

This is very good and healthy! I served it on brown basmati rice. I also added more curry. It is hard to believe that one serving is 8 points on WEIGHT WATCHERS!!!

OUCH!

Four out of five cause I thought the recipe needed some extra flavoring. My style of cooking tends to be Italian so I added about 1/8-1/4 cup dry white wine and some parmasan cheese. I also cubed the tofu, placed it on a baking tray, spaying with olive oil cooking spray and srinkled creole seasoning on top; then broiled the tofu in the oven until browned and added to the sauce last.

I didn't have creamed corn, so I used regular; didn't have curry paste so I combined 3 cloves of garlic + 1 in. sliced ginger + 2 TB chili powder + 2 TB paprika + 1 tsp white pepper + 2 TB water + 1 tsp black pepper + dash of salt; I mashed those up for my curry paste. I also added chunks of leftover beef that I  had. Everything was incredible! Adding a generous amount of garlic powder really enhanced the flavor for me. My roommate (hates curry) loved this, as did my boyfriend who isn't a fan of tofu or chick peas. AWESOME recipe! So healthy!

This is one of the first dishes I have ever made and it was fantastic.  I was looking for something that inspired me so I could get away from making sandwiches and pasta all the time.  The composition of the sauce was perfect and delicious - tasted just like the curry at the Indian restaurants I go to.  My husband said he would have used 3/4 of the can of creamed corn, but I didn't notice that the flavor was overwhelming.

I've made this dish twice and the first time I used curry powder because I didn't have any paste, but the second time I used Biryani curry paste. The tastes weren't all that different but I get did compliments all around each time. The only things I did different was to crush a little less than half of the garbanzo beans before adding them to the skillet and toss in a some crushed red pepper. I also used only half an onion - a whole one seemed like way too much. I served this with Naan instead of rice. My little brother hates all vegetables and tofu, but this recipe had him singing a different tune!

I sautéed the onion with 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and used a couple cloves of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.... sauteing that after the onions. Also stir-fried the tofu just a bit before adding to curry. I don't think any of these minor changes make the recipe any better, just more suited to my way of cooking. Loved the recipe, even though we cringed a bit at using creamed corn.

I made this the other night and added a little yogurt and some more curry paste to taste.  This disk was excellent.  I also some calliflower instead of tofu, but you can add almost anything to this dish.  My wife said this was one of the best things I have ever cooked.  I love this recipe!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times, sometimes substituting cooked chicken for the tofu, broccoli for the chick peas, or omitting the spinach. I also add about 1 cup plain yogurt at the end. This recipe has the sweet/spicy combination that I love, and the creamed corn is great, surprisingly. My fiancee LOVED this and somehow thinks I'm a genius in the kitchen. (Yesss!)

I just had to try this recipe bec I was intrigued by the use of creamed corn in a 'curry' dish :).  The outcome was pretty good - I wasn't blown away as I thought it was slightly underspiced and a bit too sweet, but overall I liked it well enough.  It would help to know exactly what chili paste to use as I think that determines a lot of the flavor - I used an Indian Ginger-Garlic paste that I already had in my fridge.  Next time I will probably take the suggestions listed in JMCCREAR's review, and add more Indian spices to it to see if I can make it a bit more flavorful.

This was a great way to get some tofu in our diet. I baked the cubed tofu in a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes, as suggested here before. I also added cubed, cooked sweet potatoes. My curry paste was very hot, so I would use less next time, but I did enjoy the recipe.

I was out of rice, so served this with quinoa instead, and it turned out great.  Next time, I will better drain (maybe even press) the tofu.  Great, healthy meal.

We loved this recipe! I added extra cayenne and curry because we like spicy food... And the creamed corn is definitely an essential ingredient! Don't forget the spinach shrinks a fair amount so be generous!

i added potatoes and carrot coins to this....you should really cook the vegetables first and then add to the creamed corn mix...which i didnt do and had to microwave everything to just soften the potatoes up..
this recipes flavour was totally unique and absolutely addictive...
i was tempted to leave out the last step of adding the spinach and basil because it had already tasted so good..
i DID not successfully find the right curry paste..i bought a Thai curry paste i realized after opening wasnt suitable so i just used alot of curry powder on its only..near 2tbsp i think...it could use a bit more heat  for some people probably...
i think next time ill bypass the spinach and basil and stay with the curry powder ...excellent!

very tasty, but tofu is still not quite as good as real paneer.  it may taste better if you fry the tofu cubes slightly and then fold them in.  try it!

This came out very spicy.  I wouldn't serve it to guests without reducing the curry paste.  I used red curry paste.  Is that what others are using?  The hotness overpowered any flavor in the other ingredients.  I'm hoping it will be better tomorrow once the flavors have "settled".  We had this with brown rice, and it was easy to prepare and a nice-looking dish.

Delicious. I added cooked and cubed red potatoes, which complements the curry taste quite nicely. My significant other enjoyed this dish despite his (unfounded) dislike for tofu. Tastes even better the next day.

This recipe is wonderful. We made it with a mild curry. First you notice the sweetness of the corn followed by a gentle warming of the pallet from the curry.

I couldn't find anything in the grocery store called "curry paste," but I did find a box labelled "golden curry sauce mix." It contained a brick of solid curry mix. I dissolved it in 14 oz. of coconut milk, over high heat, in the same pan with my already-sauteéd onions.  It created a creamy sauce, to which I added the rest of the ingredients. It turned out great! It went very well with white rice.

It is unclear which type curry paste is called for; I substituted curry powder and it did not taste right. Maybe Vindaloo paste is what you used.  I found this to be a rather bland and really dry dish, nothing like the zing of Indian cuisine. I will not make it again.

This has to be one of the best vegetarian curry recipes I have ever run across.  I use frozen spinach instead of fresh and add some raisins for sweetness.  I cook up a whole batch, freeze the extra in serving-size portions in zip lock baggies and eat over brown rice.  Excellent!!!

This recipe is in my regular rotation, especially when I feel as though I've had too much meat in my diet.My boyfriend is indian, and as others have said, creamed corn is not part of the food culture. Tomato, is often used a base. Also, tofu is not used, but rather paneer, a cheese curd. Those substitues would make this dish more authentic, but I do think the original recipe is a unique twist. My boyfriend approves, so that's good for something!

Super easy & tasty! I doubled up the portion size & added sweet potato & cauliflower. Like others, I subbed the curry paste for powder, but it still lacked some spice. Next time I'll use a curry sauce cube as well to give it a boost. Great recipe so you can make a large portion to eat throughout the week.

I thought it was bland and had to double the curry paste and then even add some curry powder at the end to give it enough flavor. I don't like really spicy food but this just wasn't flavorful enough at all without the added curry. Once that was done, I thought it was a good dish over rice.

This required a lot of changes/substitutions for this to taste good. It didn't help that I was unable to find curry paste around here.

Absolutely delicious! Forgot to buy tofu and added eggplant instead (threw in with onions at beginning) which turned out much better than expected. So quick and so flavourful.

At first we weren't too sure about this dish, but the more we let the flavors soak into the tofu (overnight) it was yummy and a must have Indian dish!

I made this dish yesterday and added a can of diced tomatoes and juice and it was delicious.  I didn't have creamed corn but used regular canned corn and I added garlic paste and garlic powder.  The dish could have done without the tofu but it's good for adding extra protein.  I will definitely be making this again and look forward to the leftovers.

I took the advice of others and toasted the tofu first. What a wonderful, satisfying meal! I doubled the 4 servings recipe for the 5 of us thinking of having leftovers for my daughter and I to have for lunch tomorrow--there isn't any left! Fabulous vegetarian fare.

Maybe I don't know enough about Indian food but this was not what I had hoped it to be.  This was not spicy at all, even though I added extra curry paste and red pepper flakes to the recipe.  Not very flavorful either.  It was just a kind of soggy, mushy mess.  Maybe it would be better served over rice or something else but by itself this dish is not very impressive.

Very good recipe!  Minced some garlic and sauteed with the onions.  Had no creamed corn on hand so used kernel corn and added milk.  Also used herbed tofu and all the flavours were great!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for posting!

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and have made a few changes, well, additions really.  I add some cooked potatoes and fresh peas.  I leave out the tofu.  I also add a little water and let it cook down longer before I add the spinach.  It just seals the flavors more for me.  Thanks for this!

I only had soft tofu on hand but baked it before hand at 450 for 20 minutes as others suggested and this helped keep it from breaking up. I baked two small halved sweet potatoes in the oven at the same time, peeled them when cooled, cubed and added with the chick peas.  I used mild curry paste. I prepared this for my daughter and her boyfriend who are both vegetarian, they seemed to like it, my husband didn't complain and I think it is one of the best vegetarian dishes I have ever made. Will definitely make again as it is quick and easy and very tasty. Not to mention super healthy!

I really had high hopes for this recipe.  Let me start with the positive: - the recipe was quick and easy to make. - it was cost effective, which I liked. It cost about $5 for the whole pot, which made several meals.  I found the recipe to be far too sweet with not quite enough spice. I adjusted the spices several times, and I still couldn't find a blend that I liked.  The consistency left something to be desired. It was more like soup than any curry I have ever tasted.  It smelled nice, but I felt like I was eating baby food.  I will not be making this recipe again.

This was my first venture with tofu. I followed some of the suggestions others had posted (made my own curry paste, pan-fried the tofu first)and added an extra 1/2 T. of curry paste. Wow! Was this ever good! It's pretty hot and spicy (esp. with the additional curry paste) but packed with flavor! I served it with whole wheat couscous. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Great warm dish for cold weather! I have made it just like the recipe says and added mushrooms, califlour, and other ingredients and it always turns out great. I typically add additional curry to my taste because I think it can be bland without it. I love it over brown rice!

The best thing about this recipe is how delicious it is, the second best thing is how easy it is to make!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using a bag of frozen spinach instead of fresh and I forgot to add the basil.  Served with basmati rice and indian pickle.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a HUGE hit! It's super easy to make & I even impressed my friend who is a chef of 10 years! Very good, I will make it again and again.

WOW! Quick and very easy!  Used fresh garlic in with the onion, and added cauliflower (steamed separately). Also used the extra firm pre-cubed tofu, which kept its shape very well. Fantastic!  Thanks very much! This will be a regular treat!

This delicious curry is surprisingly simple and easy. I used baby spinach and silken tofu, and though the latter crumbled more than desired, it still turned out very tasty. A great veggie recipe that will become a regular.

I just made this, and it is SO delicious!  I really like spicy food, so next time i might try to make it a little more spicy, but nonetheless, it was awesome!

I sauteed the tofu in a seperate pan for about 10 minutes.  I also added a little cumin as well.

This will DEFINITELY be in my repetoire!

Ugh.  I like Indian food in general and I like all the ingredients in this recipe individually, so I had high hopes for this.  Visually, it was unappealing to look at on the plate and the texture of it was also unappealling.  The taste was just sort of bland and unexciting, even using extra curry.  I hate wasting food, but I just could not eat this.

Needed a little pick-me-up in the spice department, but other than that, a wonderfully easy curry dish.

This is a great recipe! I sauteed 1/2t of cumin seeds and 1/2t garam masala with the onions and fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder); think I might saute the tofu also next time to let it get more flavor.  I used a bit more than the amount of curry paste listed because my curry paste was labeled "mild."  Also used frozen organic spinach instead of fresh since I had it on hand.  Served with jasmine rice and cucumber raita and it was great!  Incredibly inexpensive to make as well, even with organic ingredients.  Thanks bellacoola!!!

The flavor tasted great!!  It was little on the spicy side though!  I also used green curry paste, but it was a little hot.  definitely make sure you don't skip the creamed corn bit.

I'd give this more stars if I could - it was outstanding!  I also added cauliflower, and I doubled the curry paste - my boyfriend & I like a LOT of spice!  I served this over top of Vegan Curry Rice, also from this site.  Absolutely delicious!

I LOVE this recipe!!!  It cannot get any easier or tastier!!  I only made a couple of minor changes.  My DH doesn't like onions, so I left out the whole onion.  Instead, I sauteed about 3 cloves of fresh, chopped garlic in the oil.  Also, I couldn't find curry "paste" at my grocery store, so I bought a 9oz jar of India Chef - Korma Curry Sauce and used about half the jar.  I also added about a cup of frozen peas and served over cooked brown rice.  This recipe will become a regular in our house.  Yummy!

Mmmmmmmmm!  Very good.  The creamed corn in this is a MUST, it really works with the spicy curry paste and gives depth to the flavor.  We really like this and it is so versatile, a good basic recipe to work off of.

This recipe is a great way to serve tofu and everyone I served it to liked it. If you use a good curry paste (not some supermarket curry powder), this will *not* be bland.

Wow - talk about bland. I followed another reviewer's advice with the coconut milk + curry powder, and no - this is not a keeper. The spinach adds nothing, and the tofu (although bought "firm") tastes soggy and has no flavor otherwise. Very disappointing. Suggestions?

I put some garlic powder and turmeric on the tofu and sautéed it first in olive oil. I also used white beans in place of the chickpeas. When I make it again I will up the curry paste and basil to give more flavor and add a little chicken broth to thin it out a bit.

Followed the directions but added Sweet Potato and excluded the Tofu.   It could have been a bit spicier for me.  I used Mild Curry Paste.  Might add Sriracha next time. 
Overall it was excellent!

Doug really loved this. 
I used chicken breasts, not tofu. I mixed curry with sour cream to create a bath for the cut up breasts, and cooked in olive oil in an iron skillet.
I also didn't have curry paste, so I used tomato past and mixed in curry. 
The only thing I would change is to add a lot more spinach and curry.
Also used regular corn instead of creamed and green beans (fresh)

Followed this recipe fairly closely. Used fresh garlic and basil instead of dried. Pre-cooked tofu in pan first as others suggested. Otherwise followed it. Used a mild curry paste and I think it'd use something hotter next time. Overall tastes pretty good!

Super easy to make, healthy, and everyone loved it!  I did add some curry seasoning to it (about 1/4 tsp) and needed to add more salt at the end.

I've made this many times, enough that it's become a staple in our house. It cooks up fast and is easy to modify. I generally make it without tofu, and it's still delicious and filling. I occasionally add diced tomatoes or chicken, but it's great as is.

This was so great! Make sure you drain and press your tofu well, and the rest comes together quicker than a pot of rice. Even in this house of carnivores, this curry disappeared.

This dish was only OK for me.  I made the recipe as written and I didn't care for the texture of the tofu.  I do not plan to make this recipe again.

This was so delicious! I didn't have creamed corn so I used frozen, but added a can of coconut milk. I've never cooked with tofu before and I followed others' advice about baking it first. I will make this again and again. I tossed in a few red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

this came out pretty good after i made some minor alterations.. i still stuck pretty true to the recipe though.. used a small onion, doubled the curry paste (red), subbed fresh garlic (2 cloves) for the powder.. added a shallot, 1 1/2 tsp of chopped ginger, and a few dashes of curry powder.. subbed broccoli for the spinach and left out the basil.. i pan fried the tofu before adding it to the dish.. very tasty.. ty for the recipe

I froze it in single serving packages and took it for lunches with a piece of naan.  Worked really well and freezes and reheats easily.

Excellent recipe that's great for a weeknight! I didn't have the time to bake the tofu, only drained for a half hour. Replaced curry paste with a mixture of garam masala, curry powder, turmeric and coriander. Super tasty and versatile!

This is a great curry! I added two carrots, one zucchini, and one celery, all chopped. For spices, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder, one teaspoon of chili powder, and one tablespoon of curry powder instead of curry paste. I hope this helps. :)

Great recipe!! Didn't think the sweet corn would mix with the curry but it turned out wonderful!!
 Here are my changes:
1. Browned the Tofu for 15 minutes then cooked 1 tbsp Garam Marsala for 2 minutes with the Browned Tofu cubes
2. Added 1/4 cup thawed frozen peas
3. Added about two chopped gold potatos and about 1/3c water
4.  Added 1/2 Tbsp of fresh cilantro
5. Finished with a sprinkle of kosher salt and warm naan bread

This is very FAST, easy meal to put together! The flavors were great and I adjusted a few things after reading other people's reviews. 

I fried the tofu in olive oil before hand and I added a can of diced tomatoes. I also added a little cayenne pepper since I bought mild curry paste and I thought it needed a little bit of spice. 

I think this would be delicious even without the tofu and I bet that cauliflower would be a great addition too. I'll definitely make this again! You can't go wrong with a healthy, easy meal!

Quick & easy!  We liked it but, not enough flavor for us.  Next time I will follow previous reviewer's suggestions: add Garam Masala and brown the tofu before adding.

Tasty curry, I accidentally forgot to buy the creamed corn, and therefore omitted it from my batch, but it still turned out ok.  And make sure you know what level of spiciness is the curry paste (as mine turned out way too spicy with just two spoonfuls of red curry paste).   But I would definitely like to make this recipe again.

This is a winner! Made just as stated and it's a quick weeknight dinner. A bit sweet from the creamed corn, I used regular Green Giant; if there are not-as-sweet brands, try that, or perhaps add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar? Good on rice or pitas.

Personally, I didn't like this with chickpeas & tofu together, so this time I left out the tofu.  Added 2 coarsely-chopped parboiled potatoes, and a small tin of diced tomatoes insead.  And made it in the slow cooker. Served it with natural yoghurt & garlic poppadoms. Yum!  Excellent comfort food.

While this didn't taste very authentic to me, it was still great. I make it pretty regularly now. Although I think I'm going to start making it with paneer instead of tofu.

This is really not what I was expecting. I left out the tofu, maybe that makes a difference. I love all the ingredients on their own, so I expected to love this. Not nearly spicy enough.

My husband and I love this recipe!  It makes plenty to enjoy leftovers AND freeze some for a later date.  The only change I've made is I add a can of coconut milk before I add the spinach to make the curry creamier.  And on occasion I add a little extra curry for my husband.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

Been meaning to try this for a long time. It is good, but definately needs more spices, as others have said. I don't like tofu so added cubed potatoes istead. Also thought it looked boring and unappealing at the end of cooking, so added some fresh chopped tomatoes which helped the appearance a lot. Hubby liked it so I will make again, but not sure if I would do it out of my own choosing just because I'm not a big fan of chick peas OR spinache, haha!

This was good, but a little on the bland side even though I took some of the other reviewer's advice.  I prefer the flavor of the Coconut Tofu Keema recipe--it's really easy and you could add chick peas to it if you wanted to.

The spiciness of this recipe is perfect, and the corn, which I'd been skeptical about, was a nice addition.  I took the suggestion of an earlier review and baked my tofu first.  And here's the bit I'm almost ashamed to admit:  I thought I had chickpeas, and I didn't bother checking before starting to make the curry.  I was wrong, though, and tried to think of what to use in its place.  I had two hotdogs in the fridge that I needed to use, so I chopped those up and used them instead.  And guess what?  It was delicious.  :)

If I could gove this 10 stars, I would! I thought this was so tasty; extremely easy to put together. We are not big fans of tofu so we just left it out! I have made a few different curries, but I really think this is my favourite! The creamed corn makes it completely different and the consistency is perfect!! BIG THUMBS UP!!! :D

This was an okay recipe. It had good seasoning and was easy and cheap to make. It was a little bit bland, especially for a curry.

Quite good with some pita bread! my family might have been strangely ravenous that night, but for some reason 4 servings didn't really fill up 3 people. Still, the taste is great with lots of garam marsala and cumin.

I couldn't quite seem to bring much flavor to this recipe, even after doubling the spinach, doubling the curry paste, and adding red pepper flakes. Otherwise, it's not bad, and certainly easy to make. As much as I love chickpeas, I would have cut down on the amount of chickpeas in the recipe.

Very good! I couldnt find curry paste so I used curry sauce instead. I thought that an entire can of garbonzo beans was too much. Next time I will only add half.

I loved this recipe! I hardly cook, and I've never attempted Indian food. This was so easy and took no time at all. I made it almost exactly as written except I cut the oil down a bit. I will be making this again very soon.

Easy and delicious!  I added extra curry paste, cumin & cayenne pepper along with broccoli, mushrooms & chicken and it came out wonderful.  Served with basmati rice.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

I was disappointed in this dish. It was very bland. I recommend Delicious Chickpea Curry by Ratzilla instead. My family LOVED that one.

Very good. Of course, use real garlic - not powder. Add more spinach and a little less cream corn. I use a garlic-chili curry paste, which adds a bit more taste.

I did not find this to be a vary useful recipe.  The flavor comes from the curry paste, so is completely dependent on which one you buy.  I didn't care much for the flavor of the curry paste I bought, so didn't care much for how it turned out.

I liked it a lot. I did not add the basil, and added black beans instead of chick peas, and I also used green curry paste. The cream corn tasted very good in it.

This recipe is very good. I wasn't sure about the curry paste, the store carried red and green curry paste.I decided to try the red, but I don't really like it. I'm not sure if the green is better, but I plan on trying it. Anyhow, I added about 1 and 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of garam masala and that really made all the difference, yummy!

I made this recipe as directed, only I couldn't find curry paste so I substituted part of a curry sauce mix that I got at Wal-Mart.  The recipe was delicious - I will definitely make it again.  Extra points for being quick to make!

Great recipe!  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added 1t. garam marsala, 1t. ginger and 1t. cumin.  In the end I had to add more spices even though I don't particularly for hot food!  Double your spices is my suggestion, otherwise quick, easy and very tasty recipe!

An excellent curry. I added a few mushrooms and 1/2 can of coconut milk to this recipe and it was amazing. I ended up adding just a little extra curry powder as well.

This was really good. I decided to fry my tofu before I put it in. I cooked the garbanzo beans longer than instructed, and they came out nice and soft. I'll make this again.

I was kind of disappointed. It was OK but I'm not sure if I'll make it again. My biggest complaint...the chick peas were way too crunchy! 

For the veggies I had 1 boiled sweet potato, 3 boiled red potatoes, chick peas, cauliflower & broccoli frozen vegetables & chopped fresh baby spinach. 

I also doubled the mild curry paste and it still wasn't spicy enough. 

OK recipe but needs major modifications.

This was really good.  I added small red potatoes and shredded carrots to make it more of a meal, and served over brown rice.  It was definitely spicy... I used green curry paste... but not too spicy (as long as you had some rice on the side!).

I cubed and baked the tofu at 350F for 20 minutes first, as someone suggested.  I also used frozen spinach.  This was delicious and even more flavorful the next day.  I will make this again and again!

I thought this recipe was very good, healthy, and quick.  I omited the oil and used cooking spray to make it even healthier.  I also used 1 package of baby spinach to save time.  Next time, i will add potatoes; I can tell they would taste really good in the recipe.  Like other reviewers said, the creamed corn really does make this recipe delicious.
Thanks for posting!

What a great recipe. I changed a few things based on what I had in my kitchen. I sauted 2-3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic along with the onion. When I added the curry paste, I also added a small head of cauliflower chopped into small pieces (so they could cook a little longer.) The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I thought it could use a little more spice. Next time I'm going to spice it up with some chili paste or red curry paste. Thanks for sharing!

MMMMMmmmm... A very satisfying dish. I chose it because I enjoy Indian cuisine AND I love the fact it has over 23g of PROTEIN!

I used FRESH cloves of garlic which I sauted with the onions. I also made some curry rice to go with this.

This is a favorite in our house. I've made it with all kinds of vegetables - carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, etc. - and with varying amounts of curry paste and it always comes out delicious. Like other reviews recommend, I always bake the tofu first and much prefer the texture that way.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I did make a few modifications and I halved the recommended amount of spinach and added fresh green beans and a green bell pepper.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Easy & delicious! I added sweet potatoes & red pepper squares for additional color. My vegetarian daughter loved it & so did the rest of the family.
