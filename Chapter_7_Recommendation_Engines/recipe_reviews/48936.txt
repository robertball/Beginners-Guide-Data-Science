My oldest boy and I made this together after breakfast this morning--we used strawberry Kool-Aid. VERY simple. We could not wait for it to cool. He had to mix some into milk RIGHT THAT SECOND. I wouldn't recommend that. But really, this recipe is awesome. Huge hit with me and both boys.

Well, this is everything it should be but I don't think it's 5 stars!  A neat way to make whatever flavour you like, but make sure you think about it first; Kiwi Milk may not be so great :-)  I made Raspberry and plan on trying Grape and Orange.  Thanks for the recipe!  It sure takes a lot of sugar.

P.S. This stuff could be great on pancakes too.

I gave this the highest mark because it was sooo easy; I imagine anyone would have the ingredients on hand, and the result was delicious! I'm debating whether or not to share with the kids.

I've made this twice so far and it goes fast.  My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES it.  This is so much cheaper than buying the store bought syrups.

I used this as a snow cone topper. My kids absolutley loved it! It was so easy and quick, and once it cooled (I put it in the fridge) it was really thick! We tried it on pancakes too, really nice and different.

I cut the sugar in half & used grape flavor kool-aid. Even I liked the flavor it added to the milk. Neat idea...thanks!

I've been making this syrup for ages (didn't realize there was a recipe posted for it until now).  We've always used it in water - it takes up less room than a pitcher of Kool-Aid.  We keep it in those plastic non-dairy creamer bottles with the pouring spouts.
I haven't tried it in milk yet though, but I think I just might now.

This is great! Kool Aid and sugar are so much cheaper than the bottles of syrup; I made strawberry to see how it would turn out, and it is excellent! Thanks for such a cool recipe.

This syrup made surprisingly good strawberry milk! But the grandchildren will be the true taste testers. I'll amend my review after they try it.***Grandchildren approved!

What a great recipe.  It snowed here last nite and as kids came tumbling into the kitchen with cups of ice asking for spoons, I immediately remembered this recipe.  We used cherry flavored - the kids loved!

Easy to make and a nice alternative as a gift.  My mistake was I thought I had read the recipe and instructions. Instead of the powdered soft drink mix I used sugar free gelatin, adding it before the cooking process. I cooked in the microwave and it foamed up over the bowl; what a mess. The syrup turned out with a nice flavor, clear and bright. Am eager to make more flavors for Christmas gifts.
