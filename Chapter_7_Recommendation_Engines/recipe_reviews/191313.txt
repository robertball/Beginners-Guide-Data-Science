Really yummy! I didn't measure out the grated orange peel just used one large orange. Also since fresh berries are out of season I used frozen mixed berries that I had. I mad a sauce by putting 1/2 cup sugar and 1 T cornstarch and the berries in a sauce pan stirring until the sauce thickened. It went very well with the Panna Cotta. My family enjoyed this alot. I was worried about the orange flavor not coming through to much but it tasted like orange sherbert! Very quick and easy. Will make again.

The whole family enjoyed this, I cut the strawberries and put them in a bowl with the blueberries and added a couple of packs of splenda and let it sit in the frig, did not notice how long the dish had to sit in the frig till we were almost done making dinner, will make it earlier next time, had to re-do the  gelitain it had sat to long, didn't say weather to use hot or cold water used hot the first time and it firmed up quite quick (all came out with the fork) so mixed it with cold and let it sit just a minute before adding to the mixture. We ate it for an afternoon snack the next day yumm.

I did not have enough plain yogurt for the recipe, so I varied it by adding about 1/4 of a cup raspberry flavoured yogurt, and topped it with raspberries instead of strawberries. It tasted excellent. A very good recipe to try.

This was a delightful surprise!  The creamy orange flavor and the berries were perfect.  It definately tasted like dessert but was actually healthier than the veggie I served that night!  I didn't have the correct cups so I just used short juice glasses and filled them half way.  Then I put the berries right on top and served it in the glasses.  Worked great!
