Really good and really easy. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked the livers with the garlic, so that the garlic would accent the flavor and wouldn't be so strong. I also added a bit of green onions. What a nice and refreshing way to have livers...Yum.

I was amazed. My tried-and-true "recipe" for chicken livers had always involved sautéing onion slices in oil/butter, flouring the livers (liberally) and adding them to the onions, perhaps with a little milk ... to make "gravy." Jchasko's recipe was a revelation. With some trepidation, I tossed the naked livers into my heated (stainless-steel, non-treated) skillet. I fully expected them to stick tenaciously to the pan and be reduced to a bitter, scorched mess. Wow. They skittered around the pan, allowing me to move them about for uniform browning (no need for spatter shield). I did depart from Jchasko's directions a bit: I had no lemon; I added a coarsely chopped onion and a healthy shot of ground black pepper; and (because I was feeling lazy) substituted several dashes of garlic powder for the called-for six cloves of fresh garlic.  Very tasty ... and incredibly easy! Next time I may even follow the recipe!

Cooking the livers in the dry skillet was interesting--no need to use the splatter guard like I normally do when frying livers. They turned out perfectly. Unfortunately, we weren't fans of the lemon/liver combo. My lemon was very freshly picked, & the flavor of the dish reminded me of lemon bars with liver added.  I'll make this again, using the same technique, but will skip the lemon. I'd give it 5 stars without the lemon, and will be sure to add a little more garlic next time.

I followed the recipe's ingredients, but I added the onion and garlic with the chicken livers. I also added thyme, paprika, and two dashes of liquid smoke with fresh lime juice.  I increased the cooking time to 20 minutes (medium to low heat) as I like my livers done almost well.  simple and tasty.

I made them for my grandma and she loved them!  I did add some onion slices while I was frying the liver, though.  It did take much longer than 5 minutes to cook, more like 15 minutes.

6 29 17  Good, but I wouldn't say amazing.  I skipped the lemon because I'm weird about lemon sometimes; figured it'd be better squeezed on after, but didn't.  'Sure was quick.  :)

I did change the recipe sorry but I've been on a curry kick lol. I added about 1/2 tsp curry while cooking the livers. I also added the rest of ingredients while finishing cooking, because it was sticking to the pan. And as someone else wrote, I wanted to incorporate the garlic in more. It was very good. Thanks for adding this recipe.

I used minced garlic and garlic seasoning also added light butter. And threw some onions and green peppers and lemon juice while sautéing the livers! Turned out great I keep the carbs down so I’m happy with all the protein ??

I also added fresh lime juice instead of lemon and I added the garlic, olive oil and lemon juice at the same time.
It's absolutely delicious!  It took a little longer to cook to my liking.

Don’t like raw garlic on cooked meat so I added it in to the pan once the livers were almost cooked. This dish lacks flavour. Will not make it again and wouldn’t recommend it to my friends

Made this per recipe and I def did not like the lemon  I even used less than what it asked for. It also took me longer than 5’ to cook. It was an easy recipe and quick to make, even past the 5’. I also used more garlic because I love garlic. Will make again without lemon.

I thought the lemon juice was great and pulled everything together, offsetting any heaviness. At the end I removed the livers, left the gravy and some of the garlic in the pan, added half a sweet onion (diced), and continued cooking for just a few more minutes. The onions gave it juiciness, crunch, and sweetness. Without the onions I thought the livers were on the boring side. I, too, cooked the garlic along with the livers, but next time, as long as I've got the cooked onions, I want to try adding the garlic at the end according to the recipe.
