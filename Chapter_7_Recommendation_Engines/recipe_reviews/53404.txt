A divine recipe! I didn't have time to marinate it for 24 hours but did soak the meat for a good 14 hours and was it flavorful and tender! My flank steak was extrememly thin so I only grilled it for 3 minutes per side on medium. I served a Chimmichuri sauce on top of the steaks and that really cut the sweetness of the marinade - complimented it beautifully. To make the Chimmichurri Sauce, I put 1/2 c fresh parsley, 3 T olive oil, 2 T red wine vinegar, 3 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/2 t salt in a mini food processor. Pureed it until everything was blended and then poured a thick strip of sauce down the center of the slices of steak on everyone's plate. All I can say is that it was absolutely delicious and we are going to be making this steak all the time in the future!

Absolutely delicious. Super fast and easy.  Marinade takes about 5 minutes to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the optional chilli, and tripled the garlic (we are garlic lovers).  I marinated for abuot 24 hours, and the meat was soooooooo flavorful. I over-grilled it accidentally, so it wasn't as tender as I like, but I think if you make it rare or medium it will be just right.  Two days' worth of dinner gone in one sitting.  I kept the marinade, and plan to use on some leftover cooked chicken.

Not bad, wasn't as impressed as some others, though tasty, it was nothing to rave about. Could be marinated longer and definately do not overcook, it is better on the rare side when grilled.

This was too sweet... personally I expect, and prefer, a meat to be either spicy or salty and this was neither. Major dissapointment.

This was a very flavorful marinade that reminds me a lot of beef teriyaki.  I broiled it in the oven and it turned out very tender and tasty.

Not really worth the great reviews.  The flavoring it gave to my steak was rather bland and I marinated for over 24 hours.  I will not be making this again.

GREAT STEAK! No A1 or Heinz steak sauce needed for this tender, juicy, and flavorful meat! I did add just a PINCH of brown sugar. An all-around wonderful recipe that will be made time and time again. Thanks Willyboyz!

Very pleased with this recipe.  I put in slightly less honey, replaced the chili with red pepper flakes and doubled the garlic.  I broiled until the internal temperaure reached 140 degrees and then let it sit for 5 minutes before carving.  During this time, the temp rose to 145 degrees and was perfect.  I also boiled the extra marinade and used it as a sauce to serve over the meat.  Delicious.

This was very different and quite tasty.  I added a little bit of cayenne pepper to the marinade and kept the meat in it for over 24 hours.  I will make this again.

This was amazing! I used red wine vinegar instead of wine, and grilled it on my indoor grill, 6 min per side. It was moist with a great flavor. We will be trying this again with chicken!

All I can say is - WOW!  Despite the description, I did make this one without being able to marinade overnight (I only gave it 1 1/2 hours).  It was still a very good marinade.  The second time I made this, it was given the full 24 hours and it was so delicious we wished we would've made more steaks.  Like I said before - wow!

This was so simple to make but the flavor was awesome.  Would sever this to guests too.  After reading one of the reviews saying they like spice in their meats, I added some read pepper flakes and a little more of the chilli powder.  It had plenty of spice and the extra chilli powder took away from the sweetness.  Awesome recipe.

Good, but very similiar, I believe, to another recipe (Easy Teryiaki Chops by Kathy Statham).  We like to use homemade marinades because it gives you the taste of eating at a fancy place without paying the price.

This was so good.  I would use this for any kind of beef - great for grilling or stir fry.  I used round steak and let it marinate for 2 days.

Absolutely delicious. I have been dreaming of this  steak ever since I tasted it two weeks ago. I cant wait to have it again. Take the submitters advice and leave it to marinate overnight, it makes the meat so tender and flavoursome.

I found the flavor of this a little too strong.  The next time I will try to adjust some of the ingredients a bit.  I used flank steak and it did come out juicy and tender.  My husband thought it was perfect just as the recipe was written.

Greatest steak I have ever made. Grilled to perfection with the 7 minutes each side. The marinade was just fantastic and I followed the instructions and waited 24+ hours of marinating, a must. I used a cabernet that was sitting around and it worked perfectly.

I have used this marinade for years, but the timing on the steak was perfection.  Kudos! Wine not necessary and I substitute sugar if I dont have honey!

We love this recipe and always get yummy sounds from all we serve it to.  It's easy, fast, (after marinating) . We usually serve with roasted potatoes, and asparagus.

I'm rating 4 stars only because I have another recipe very similar to this that I like better.  If you add the full amount of honey you really need to watch it closely as it grills because it will likely get a little too charred and you don't want a black piece of meat.  Also, no oil in the marinade so definitely get some on your grill.   My other recipe calls for dry sherry so if you don't have a bottle of red open you can sub this and it works well.

Oh boy, this is GOOD. We were out of gallon-size Ziploc bags, so I just poured the marinade into a dish and put the steak in on top of it, and flipped it every few hours (it had been marinading since early yesterday afternoon.) It turned out delicious. The four of us feasted on it tonight - thanks for a great, quick, easy and absolutely amazing recipe that will go in my regular rotation for sure!

I have to admit, I have never used rosemary before and was a bit afraid of the outcoming taste,
but, I have to say that this was just an excellent steak.  The flavor was not overpowering, the
texture was perfect and the aromas were so pleasant while grilling.  This will definitely be made again.

This marinade is great - lots of flavor.  I threw in fresh sprigs of rosemary because that's what I had and the essence of it still came through nicely.  It's absolutely imperative that the meat be marinated overnight and to cut it according to these instructions because flank steak is a fibrous cut otherwise.

Willy you the man!  This will be added to my summer BBQ list.  The whole family enjoyed it from 3 yrs. old and up.  I had to to be stopped from eating too much, thanks for the recipe.

Waaaay too vinegary for our tastes but worth doing for one meal anyway.  Will not make again.

The steak was delicious. Although, we cooked it in the broiler until it was well done it was still moist and tender.  We will definitely use this recipe again.  Our 8 year old who won't eat anything cleaned her plate.  Thank you Willyboy!

Really enjoyed this recipe, though when I went back to read it now I realized that I used red wine vinegar instead of just red wine- oops!  We topped it with the  Chimmichuri sauce on top of the steaks and that really cut the sweetness of the marinade - suggested by another review.  I've included that recipe again. To make the Chimmichurri Sauce, I put 1/2 c fresh parsley, 3 T olive oil, 2 T red wine vinegar, 3 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/2 t salt in a mini food processor. Pureed it until everything was blended and then poured a thick strip of sauce down the center of the slices of steak on everyone's plate.

You have got to be kidding me! This is the BEST marinade I have ever had, honestly. My first time trying flank steak, and I was scared, believe me. I wasn't sure how it would turn out. Absolutely out of this world fabulous! I have chicken marinating as I type. I expect nothing but greatness from it. And he is right. If you can't marinate overnight, don't even waste your time. Believe me, it is well worth the wait!

Very good, very, very, very good. This is something I will try again for sure. I found that brown sugar or syrup will get you the same result as honey. Also I have tried it without red wine (I didn´t have a bottle on hand)and it didn´t seem to make a difference but the excuse to open a bottle was much missed! :-)

We really liked this recipe. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon. I used a few drops of tabasco instead of the chili powder and added a extra clove of garlic.
Thank you for the recipe!

Yummy.  I added juice of one lime & broiled it for @ 7 minutes per side & let it rest for 5 minutes.  Very good affordable weeknight dinner.

This was great! I added a little worchesershire and more garlic.  It came out so juicy and tender I was impressed.  It was a litte sweeter than I would have liked, so next time I will cut back a little on the honey.

Made for the first time. I love this. easy, fast and inexpensive. Next time I will use a little more chili powder. Might add one chipolte to marinade. I like food on the spicy side.

Got rave reviews even though I over cooked the meat. Marinated the steak for 24+ hours. Asked everyone if the meat was too sweet because of the other reviews and no one said it was. A+++ marinade. Will be entering this recipe in my Top Chef competition at the end of the month. Should be interesting to see what others have to say.... especially the food guy from the local Chicago news channel. Think this will be the ultimate test.

I was always a little afraid to prepare flank steak, but I took a chance and tried Willyboy's recipe.  Can I tell you...Willyboy is a genius!  It was not difficult to prepare, it WAS delicious, even though I prepared it by broiling it rather than using my barbeque.  I am definitely going to make this again, and again, and again.

This is a great marinade!  I use red wine vinegar because I didn't have any red wine on hand and it worked great. It sat for almost exactly 24 hours and the flavors really soaked in.  Great!

Pretty good, my boyfriend loved it.  A little too sweet for my personal taste but I'm sure we'll make it again.   Only marinated for about 10 hours and cooked for about 5 minutes each side, resting for about 10 minutes.  Cooked to medium doneness.

This recipe is one of my favorites. I have used it atleast 3 times and ready to make at this moment to marinate over night and have tomorrow.  You HAVE to marinate over night. I can't say I changed anything, so don't be afraid to try it just as it is!  It's WONDERFUL!

I agree....it was wonderful.  My three daughters, aged 8 and below (including one VERY picky eater), LOVED it, as did my husband and I.  We will use leftovers today for steak burritos.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a fantastic marinade.  Great teriyaki-like flavor.  I marinated 24 hours as suggested, and the meat was flavored all the way through.  Will definately make again.

Very easy to make, and good even when having to resort to broiling.  I don't think it's too sweet at all.

I thought this recipe was really easy.  I had all of the ingrediants already, let the meat marinate 24 hours as recommended and it turned out just fine.  It is a little on the sweet side, but I like it that way.  It was not overpowering, simple and good.

This was really good!  Both of my kids and my husband ate it and liked it.  I don't usually cook with red (or any other) wine, but it really adds to the flavor of this dish.  I also broiled instead of grilling it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was good, but I didn't think it was to DIE for like so many other people said. I'd make it again, but there are lots of other great marinades out there, too.

Thank you Willyboy for a FANTASTIC marinade recipe.  I was not able to let it go 24 hrs.  I let it go over 12 hrs. and it was WONDERFUL!!  Also, I did not have the red wine. I used sherry instead.  It was awesome!  I try not to change recipes the first time I use them, but had no choice this time.  What a great way to use a cheaper cut of meat!!!!

I cut a flank steak in half to make this recipe as one of our entrées and 'Sloppied Flank Steak Sandwiches' from AR as our second entrée. This was very good and enjoyed by all.  I think the key is having the grill on high heat to make the nice crust on the meat.  We grilled for 6 minutes on each side, rested for 10 minutes, and it was perfect.  It was served with 'Best Potatoes You'll Ever Taste' and 'Greek Yogurt Coleslaw' from AR.

CAVEAT: I am allergic to garlic, so I left that out, and that may be the problem.

Having said that, I make a lot of recipes without garlic and usually if I increase some other spices, they are fine. I can usually tell when they will be OK.

This was very bland in spite of my having added extra chili powder - and actually some cayenne pepper too. 

Although I like sweet marinades and glazes this was too sweet for my tastes.  

I think we could have gotten as good results with some commercial teriaki sauce and not had to plan a day ahead. 

It wasn't at all bland, just not worth the hype in my and my husband's opinions.

I made this and because of a change in plans, it marinated for 2 days in the fridge.  I cooked it on the bbq for 7 minutes per side, let it rest, and cut it in very thin strips.  We had it on Greek pitas with tzatziki, cucumbers, tomatoes and mixed greens.  It was pretty good.  I have a similar recipe that uses red wine vinegar instead of red wine, so I think I will try that next time - I found the wine flavor a little too strong, and I love red wine!  Will definitely serve it the same way again.

This turned out great. It was easy to make and the marinade gave it a great flavor. We had a 2 lb. flank steak, so I grilled it 5 minutes on a side. It came out a nice medium rare in the middle. It was very juicy.  The only things I did differently was that I omitted the chili powder and used fresh instead of dry rosemary. I served it on french rolls w/ sauteed onions and yellow bell peppers. It was a hit.

Oh soooo good. My 5 year old who doesnt eat meat very often loved it. I marinated for over 24 hours. And we grilled it on our BBQ pit. I served it w/ a corn souffle and Honey Buttered Carrots.  Thanks for this recipe. I will use it again.

this recipe, and you will not be disappointed. The sauce left over after cooking should be reduced a little and great over rice, couscous or pasta.

I made this tonight and really liked the result.  I did add some brown sugar to the marinade after reading some of the other reviews. I enjoy sweet meat, my husband does not.  If you are like him, this is not for you.  Even without the little bit of brown sugar I think it would have been too sweet for him.

Delicious! Remember to let the meat sit for a couple of minutes after removing from the grill to lock in juices, and to slice against the grain. I was afraid this was going to be tough, but it wasn't.

This is a great marinade and way cheaper than buying it bottled. I'd like to try it again with a few tweaks. Maybe adding some Tahini paste or maybe some teriyaki would jazz it up a bit. Definitely pays to marinate as long as you can. Thanks!

This was a good marinade.  I think next time I will add more than a pinch of all the spices.  Didn't think it was too sweet.  It has a sweetness to it but that would be expected with 1/4 cup of honey.  Will make it again.

Very good and tender.  I did not have any honey so I used a sweet red wine and a tablespoon of sugar. I also added red pepper flakes. The steak had nice sweet spicy flavor.

I agree with the other reviewers, this is too sweet. Easy to make, but I think I can find a better flank steak recipe.  The cooking time is for medium rare which was okay by me.  It you want medium or well done you need to increase the cooking time

I made this for Christmas dinner, and was very pleased with the results.  I crushed the rosemary very well, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It has a wonderful, mildly sweet flavor that I thought was perfect.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very good. My whole family liked it. I grilled it-just be careful not to overcook becuase you lose some of the flavor of the marinade.

This was good, but I was expecting a lot better, given the raving reviews.  I marinated for about 22 hours, but the edges of the flank steak were much too salty for my tastes.  

I seared the steak on the stove and then broiled - it turned out very tender.  The medium rare center was perfect!

I thought this was quite good, but my husband thought it was a little sweet.  I used port instead of red wine (all I had), 3 garlic cloves, some herbs for beef and a tad less honey than called for.  I'll make this again, but will tinker a little further.  Maybe a touch of vinegar and buy some red wine...good stuff!

I really loved this marinade. I did add extra garlic cause I loooove garlic. This steak tasted like one of my favorite steaks at my favorite resturant, but even BETTER!!! this steak is more sweet then salty so if you do not like your meat a little sweet then you may not like it but give it a try anyway, it was soooooo good!!!!! I made it two days in a row!!!!

For the amount of effort this recipe takes, the reward is huge.  It take about 5 minutes to prep the steak the day before, then simply grill it and you are good to go.  The steak has a wonderful flavor and the beef is oh so tender.

Very good marinade. I can see why you need to marinade it overnight.  The spices go throughout the meat.

Wonderful taste at rare about 138 degrees internal.  Easy to adjust spices to your liking.  We are doing a splachlocked whole chicken this weekend and will use this marinaide with a little EVOO and more salt and pepper added to the mixture.  KEEPER for sure!!!

Made this for my family tonight. I stuck to the recipe. I let it marinade for close to 24 hours.  Since its winter, I cooked it in the broiler, 8 minutes one side, 10 minutes the other. Turned out medium-rare and delicious. There wasn't a sliver of steak left. My family loved it. I'll definitely make it again.

two weeks ago, we gave it the recommended 24 hrs and added some ground ancho chile. 

Seared it on outdoor grill for 3 minutes per side. 

Was perfect on top of "power greens" for first meal. Soy profile worked well for szechuan fried rice, the next night. 

Doing a second flank with same marinade, today.

Follow the instructions about marinating. I would serve with rice,  grilled onions or mushrooms, and perhaps a grilled vegetable or salad. Should do well with a good Shiraz or Merlot.

I can say the marinating time ,  and cook time were spot on.  I went to the Buzz for a little reassurance ( thank you sassyoldlady , and Molly .) The recipe instructions turned out a very juicy and flavorful piece of meat , however ,  it was just way too sweet for our tastes .  The amount of honey could for sure be cut in half ,  and the savory doubled .  Probably won't be a do over here .  Thanks for the recipe Willyboyz .

This was pretty good. I added more garlic (chopped not crushed) along with all the marinade ingredients and felt it still needed more flavor. Even with the soy sauce it needed salt. Not bad though. The steak was pretty pricey so I wished I would have loved it. Hubs loved it!

This was awesome. I've made lots of different flank steak recipes, but the flavor combo in this marinade really hit the spot and made the meat delectable. Will definitely make this one again.

We went out and bought a small $18 grill just so we could make this and it was worth every penny! This is one of the best steaks I've ever tried.
