I had a frozen drink party and this was a huge hit.  We ran out of lemon juice and made a batch with lime juice and liked it even more.  I misread the recipe as calling for teaspoons of sugar it was perfect with just three teaspoons.

Okay, any whiskey will do. But we prefer Jack at our house. Increase to 3/4 C, and blend really well. Don't use lemon juice from the bottle. It's not the same. MMMMM. I made this for a party, and everyone asked for more.

Can you say brain freeze? Made with Jack Daniels if you please.  It was the only change we made. Refreshing drink on a hot day.  Thanks for a quick easy recipe.

I used lime juice instead of lemon and it was fantastic!  Will definitely make this again.

YUM! I ran out of store-bought whiskey sour mixer and looked for a sour recipe.  This one is excellent.  Normally I use a shaker to make a sour, but the frosty result with the blender is very good.  It will be particularly welcome in the summer.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper!
