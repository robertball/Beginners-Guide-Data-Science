I made a double batch of this recipe because I was making two pies, a fresh Strawberry and a Key Lime.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using plain graham crackers instead of cinnamon ones, and carefully pressed the mixture into two glass 9" pie plates.  I used a wide spoon to smooth the crust and press it very firmly in place.  When I began brushing the beaten egg yolk on( using a soft, long bristled pastry brush), everything started to fall apart!  The sticky yolk just tore up my crust.  It was a very tedious and messy job, and I used both my beaten yolks on the first crust, and it was very unevenly covered.  I decided to put the second crust in the freezer to firm up the melted butter while I baked the first yolky one in the oven.  When it came out of the oven, it was definately well set, and no longer crumbly.  I took piecrust number two out of the freezer and lo and behold it was nice and firm, and the yolk brushing went perfect with no crumbling!  Finished result- excellent crusts!  Just chill before brushing on the egg yolk!

This was the first time I ever got a compliment on a pie crust!!  I used 2 cups of Cinnamon Sugar Oatmeal 
Crunch graham crackers (Kroger brand), 1/2 cup melted butter, and 3 T of sugar for one 9 1/2 inch deep dish pie.  The taste was an awesome compliment to the French Silk chocolate filling.  I didn't have a bit of trouble spreading the egg yolk...but I pressed the crust REALLY hard into the plate so I think that may have stabilized it.  Also, it cut and served like a dream!  Thanks for sharing!  This will be the ONLY graham cracker crust I serve from now on!

This crust tasted wonderful; however, it stuck to the pie pan and we had to destroy our pie to get it out.  The taste was so good that I will try again!

For those having problems with the crumbs while brushing on the egg...make sure you are using real butter and not margarine.  It may make a difference.  And, make sure the crumbs are very fine and not chunky.

I really like this recipe. The egg yolk was hard to brush onto the crust (that's why I gave it four stars), but I actually ended up spreading it easier with the back of a measuring spoon. I wonder if I refrigerated the crust before brushing the yolk if the cold butter would hold the crust together better. Because of the review saying the crust stuck to the pan, I brushed my stoneware pie plate with a very little amount of butter. No sticking! I didn't use cinnamon graham crackers because cinnamon wouldn't fit with the lemon truffle pie. I used organic graham crackers to avoid partially hydrogenated veg. oil. I'll definitely use this crust over and over again.

We loved this recipe with gingersnaps rather than graham.  It took me 2 egg yolks to brush on entire surface, but the egg is what makes the crust so perfect.  Thanks for this recipe

Great taste with lower sugar and fat than my old recipe. Three ideas: I microwaved Imperial margarine (lowest fat margarine)in the pie plate to butter the pan; then used fingers/back of spoon to spread the crumbs so it made the butter disperse and stay together; Hints from Heloise's tip that I use for all pies:  use a whole egg, lightly beaten, and apply with a pastry brush to the bottom only though for this, I followed the recipe and covered the sides as well. This crust was used for a fudge pie...a winning combination of fudge chocolate and a buttery crust. My family raved!

I felt really dumb, but I found it nearly impossible to brush the crust with egg yolk.  It kept clumping up on the pastry brush.  I added water to thin the egg yolk to no avail.  I did like the idea of using cinamon graham crakers, though.

i too had trouble brushing on egg yolk, even after i beat it a while.  i thought that was the trick, but it wasn't.  and yes, it was very firmly pressed.  i wish jackie would respond and tell us how she brushes this one.  if i had about 3 yolks, i guess i could do it.

The taste was great, however, I found it hard to press into the pie pan without it crumbling. It may need more butter or a "sticking agent" than listed on the recipe. It even stuck to my baking pan. The taste, however, was great...so this is probably a recipe I will use again with modifications.

While the crust was tasty, while pressing it into the pie pan firmly then brushing on the egg yolk, I think the yolk ended up sealing in the moisture from the crust, and therefore the crust turned out tough. This would be good if you needed to make the pie a day+ in advance perhaps, providing a barrier between filling and crust, but I wouldn't do this if I made the pie the same day I was eating it...tasty though.

I guess this crust will turn out okay, but the egg yolk is really pointless. Way to thick to brush on anything, let alone crumbly cracker crumbs. Also, 1 yolk could never cover a 9 inch circle. I don't get it.

This was good and I used it with Key Lime Pie IX. I don't get the egg yolk part and will leave this out next time. And I would use more butter, like maybe 4 oz.

This crust is easy and good.  I think it wouldve been much better if I hadn't overbaked it.  It freaked me out a bit when I took it out after 10 min--was almost liquidy like a cake or quick bread.  So I put it back in the oven for another 10 min.  Not a good idea--overbaked it with my cheesecake.  However, the taste is good, just a bit difficult to cut.  ;o)  I used gingersnap cookies bc I didn't have graham crackers, and used margarine bc I can't eat butter.  It was easy enough to brush egg on; perhaps bc of how greasy it was.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good but I also had the trouble with brushing the yolk on...the whole crust clumped up. I got it to press back down afterwards but I honestly didnt taste the difference. It was good but I didnt taste the difference the egg made. Next time I'll leave the egg out.
