This recipe as stated doesn't have enough spices to it to mellow out the tomato paste flavor. I made it because the rice crispies intrigued me. But I ended up researching other sloppy joe recipes on this site to add spice and flavor to the tomato sauce; basically, liquid smoke, worcestershire sauce, molasses, cumin, etc. I have never rated a recipe with a one-star but this recipe simply isn't good. Sorry!

After reading that it was "too tomatoey", I cut back the whole peeled tomatoes to a 14.5 oz can.  Even then, it was coming out more watery than I like, so I added about another 3/4 - 1 cup of the rice krispies and it turned out perfect.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I cooked this for my family tonight, and we loved it!  It was quick, not too many ingredients, and completely affordable!  Delicious, delicous, delicious.... this will be a new "regular" in our family meals!
