I know I'm the person who shared the recipe, but I wanted to share a few more things with you. First of all, if you like lemon, use more of the juice and zest. I know I usually do. Finally, if you want your asparagus super tender and you have the time and the patience, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus (not the head) before you boil it. This especially works if your asparagus is very thick. If you are not sure where to cut off the bottom end of your asparagus, just grasp hold of the top and bottom of your stalk and bend it from the bottom until it breaks. The asparagus will break at the spot where the tough ends and the tender begins. Enjoy!

This is great!  I did make a few minor changes, I wrapped only 1 or 2 pieces of asparagus not 5 (we really like prosciutto) and I  put the lemon on the asparagus before I wrapped them (more lemon flavor on the asparagus).

The simplicity of this recipe drew me to it, but the popularity of it to my Thanksgiving guest will bring me back.  The lemon juice squeezed on top is the key to the flavor.  I served it with some spears NOT wrapped in prosciutto, but guests ate both in equal proportion.  Also, I found an accompanying sauce recipe from Everyday Food and altered it to fit my ingredients available - 1/2 cup greek yogurt, juice of one lemon and dried dill to taste.  It was a hit!

Lisa is one of my best friends, and a great cook, so I knew I had to try these.  I'm glad I did.  These are awesome!  My asparagus were pretty thin, so I only boiled them for about 3 minutes and then submerged them in an ice bath to stop the cooking.   My Italian husband also raved about them.  We will definitely be making these again.  Lisa, you're the best!  Thanks for the recipe dear friend!

I wasn't sure about the cold asparagus but, I will have to say that this recipe is wonderful.  I fixed this dish without any changes as a side dish for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  So easy and so good.  Thank you for the recipe.  A nice do ahead dish with no last minute fussing around.

Not a favorite in our house, at all.  Based on the rave reviews, I thought I'd serve this at Easter dinner, as a side to go with our lamb.  Although the presentation was nice and everyone liked the cold asparagus, I noticed that everyone tossed the prosciutto (including me) and nobody went back for seconds, which left me with a lot of left-overs that we tossed. Disappointing.  The meat was obviously a turn-off and even though I gave my asparagus a "bath" in lemon juice, it barely picked up any of the flavor.  Note: if you decide to try it - make sure you barely blanche the asparagus. Based on another review, I kept mine in for almost 5 minutes and the tops turned to mush which didn't look very nice.

This is a perfect refreshing vegetable dish.  Balanced just right between sweet, salty and citrus.

I needed to bring an appetizer to a holiday party. I needed something that was simple and could be made ahead of time without last minute cooking. Also wanted something gluten free and dairy free since some of the partygoers are on restricted diets. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. A bonus: it was easy to make and I got lots of compliments!

I brought this to a party as an appetizer. I cut each asparagus into three shorter pieces, then wrapped the small bundle with a smaller strip of prosciutto.  This makes it a two or three bite finger food.
