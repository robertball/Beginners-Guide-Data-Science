i'm indian and we make keema quite often. we mostly make it with beef or mutton. i think it needs more spices like jeera(cumin), dhania(coriander) and if you want it spicy maybe some chilli powder(i like my food extra hot!).add a couple of cinnamon sticks for a lovely aroma.

so very good! we don't eat lamb, so i substituted ground beef, and it turned out delicious. my modifications: i added a teaspoon of curry powder, and dashes of coriander and cumin. also, a bit of cayenne for a little heat; to us, indian food needs it! also doubled the beef broth so it would be more "saucy", and added about a cupful of frozen peas with the beef broth. simmered for about 10 minutes, and it was perfect! served over basmati rice, with nann and raita on the side. my fiance raved, said it was better than any meal he'd had in an indian restaurant. a true keeper, thank you!

It is very good with peas and rice, but needs raitha (whipped yogurt with cukes and other veggies) to really bring out the flavor. It makes a nice pita filling when paired with grilled veggies. For a healthier option, it is just as tasty made with ground turkey.

My family is Desi, and to make this the traditional pakistani way, use ground beef. Also, we add potatoes that cook in the broth. It always has peas in it traditionally. Also, it is missing cumin (this is a MAJOR ingredient in keema) as well as a couple cinnamon sticks and some cloves. We have never eaten this with Raita, usually with some parathas or pooris over basmati rice. This is like the desi meatloaf recipe: lazy night cooking, as it is super quick and easy. You don't usually find this in a restaurant because it is so simple, but it is the simple dishes that evoke the most memories. I love this dish. Also, I would not add curry powder to this, but it does not matter what you add I guess, it just does not traditionally have it. And it is the cinnamon that brings out the heat (spicy-ness) in the dish so it is a critical ingredient.

This was really good. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to make adjustments to it otherwise it would have been on the blander side. I took the advice of others and added 1 tsp extra garam masala, 1tsp curry powder, 1tsp cumin, 1tsp ginger, a tad extra salt, 1c of peas and doubled the broth. i used ground turkey because that's what i had on hand and it was still great! this is the easiest and tastiest meal. loved it cos i had all the ingredients on hand and anything that i didnt have could easily be substituted!!! try it- you will be happy :)

I make this all the time, and the trick is to add more garam masala than the recipe calls for, and also add a little coriander and cumin. Also add a splash of water and let simmer for some time, keeping adding water to prevent drying.

Since we raise sheep, I am always looking for lamb recipes. This was really good poured over puff pastry shells!  I spiced it up a tad with some red pepper.  This is a recipe I will include with any freezer lambs we sell.

Caution!!! Very spicy! Tastes great but is definitely not for the faint of taste buds. Next time I will cut the garam masala in half.

I made this with ground sirloin (my grocery store doesn't carry ground lamb, unfortunately), and it was very flavorful! Served with Nan or rice and a vegetable, this makes a fabulous main dish!

I was looking for a quick and dirty recipe that involved the use of garam masala and ground beef. This one fit the bill. Four stars because I believe it would have been bland without the spices I used suggested by other reviewers. My recipe used a package of ground beef, 2.5 tablespoons garam masala, a teaspoon of salt, a dash of coriander, cayenne pepper, cumin and cinnamon. I ground the coriander myself. Then I mixed in the onion, garlic, beef broth and tomato paste as suggested. My husband and I really enjoyed this meal and I'll be keeping it around for future use. Thanks again!

i gave this 4 stars but as an indian, it was still so bland for me!  and hubby & i like food to be super flavorful.  so what i did, i added 1/4 spn turmeric, 1 1/2 spns corriander pwder, 1/4 spn ginger garlic paste, 2 spns garlic powder, 1/2 chicken cube, dash of oregano, little ketchup and 2 1/2 spns of montreal chicken seasoning, red chili pwder and dash of red pepper flakes, and voila, it came out super duper tasty!  once it's all cooked up nicely, i grind it to make the texture softer for the kids.  ground beef now becomes very tender instead of rough meat.  kids will love!  ok, im sure indians are going to say this now NOT keema, lol, but for those of you who find this recipe bland, this is the way to spruce it up!!

This was a very good recipe that my whole family enjoyed. I put this over noodles because my two oldest boys don't care for rice that much, but I personally think it would be better over rice. No big deal though, and certainly nothing that changes the taste of the sauce. I did not have enough garam masala so I made my own using 2t coriander,  3t cumin, 1t cinnamon, 2t ginger, and 1t black pepper. If you need a quick inexpensive meal this is a good one to try. I am looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thank you, ajr.

I'm not sure about this one. It has a very different "floral" taste (from the Garam masala).  After tasting, I added ginger, as suggested by one reviewer. Maybe it is one of those flavors you need to acquire a taste for, or already be familiar with. ?  Plus, I do not know what to do with it. I wanted to stuff a pepper with it, or something. It seemed too dry to put over rice or noodles. My creativitity is at a standstill on this one. I am not sure what veggies, etc. would COMPLIMENT this unique flavor. Any suggestions would be appreciated, because I made a double batch and will have to freeze half. I wish I had a recipe for the "raitha" one reviewer said they added to it.

We enjoyed this recipe but I did as other reviews had suggested.  Added coriander, cumin, cayenne pepper cinnamon and some coconut milk.  I did not have paste but used tomato sauce next time will try some canned diced tomatoes.  I had used ground lamb since I had a couple of packs in the freezer.  When I first tried it was thinking that this was a bust however, after simmering for a couple of hours it turned out great.   Will be making again.

Very yummy but needed a bit more spice/flavours. I used extra lean ground beef and I added cumin, cayenne, coriander, tumeric & salt and pepper. With the additions it tasted great!

Good recipe, however i took others advice, and added a cinnamon stick, 2 cardamon pods, coriander powder, cumin, and chopped up some jalapenos for some added spice. I also used only 1 heaping tablespoon of tomato paste. It came out wonderful, I will be making this again and again!!

This recipe is really good.  I made a few changes, such as using only 1lb of meat, and increasing the broth to 1 cup.  I also added 1/4 tsp cayene pepper, 1tsp cumin and 1tsp corriander.  Very tasty and easy to make.

Despite reading countless other reviews suggesting to add extra spices. I made the recipe exactly as written. The flavour was all right, but I think it could have used a little something else. I would suggest reading the posted reviews and adding the extra spices that you think would fit your families tastes!

Stick with the recipe and don't add the extra spices.  If you do, you won't be able to taste the lamb.     Otherwise good quick dish.

This is totally a 5+ dish.  Both for taste and easy of preparation.  I only had one pound ground lamb and tofu spaghetti noodles and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  DH added just a few drops of hot sauce to his but otherwise made it exactly as written.  Thanks for another wonderful meal.  I will be making this over and over.

Made this recipe tonight with the girlfriend using 1 lb. Ground Turkey.  Served over Rice (for her) and Angel Hair (for me).  We served it with a Cilantro-Mint Chutney on Pita Bread, and followed with some Gulab Jamon.  There was extra Cilantro, so we through it in the Keema.  It was wonderful, although we ended up dirtying nearly ever plate, bowl, and cooking utensil we own.  Good times in the kitchen.

Really tasty stuff. I parboil a few potatoes, dice them and add them after the rest of the ingredients.

This was delicious.  I did not have ground lamb so used lean ground beef.  I used the cooked mixture as a filling for rolls.  Although DH thought it was a bit dry after reheating, the taste was still spicy and great.  I definitely will make this many times.

THANK YOU!!! This tastes just like a dish I tried from a Pakistani woman and had asked her for, but never received the recipe.  The only thing its missing is a little ginger, which I will add next time.

I have made this twice now and everyone has LOVED it! I added peas, and served with rice and naan the first time. Second go I used this as a filling for samosas- YUM! I like a little more cumin and coriander than called for. Excellent versatile dish!

Cinnamon is definitely a key ingredient in this dish! I added extra cardamom, coriander, cumin and cinnamon to the existing recipe and only had 1lb of lamb and the dish was still bland until I added more cinnamon. It would be much better to simmer the dish with cinnamon sticks, as others have suggested. I only had ground cinnamon so I used that. Otherwise, I added peas right at the end to warm them up and served it over brown basmati rice. Yum!

This recipe was excellent and super easy! Based on the previous reviews I made the following modifications: 
used ground beef instead of lamb, 
only used 1.5 TBS garam masala, 
added 1/2 tsp. curry and 1/2 tsp. cumin, 
added 1 can of chick peas, 
used 5 tsp. of tomato paste, 
used 1 cup beef broth. 

Served over jasmine rice and it was fantastic! Excited to have found a new ground beef recipe for the books!

I, too,  added a little cumin and coriander.  It was a little too spicy for my kids, but I and the hubby loved it, of course he also added sriracha.  I didn't have raitha, so the kids topped with some sour cream to cut the heat.   I made it a "one-pot" dish by adding one cup of RICE and some peas, upped the beef broth to 2 cups, brought to a boil and then put on low, covered for @20 minutes.

This was great!! I did, however, make a few changes. First I heated some olive oil and added about a tsp of cumin seeds, a broken cinnamon stick and 2-3 cloves (let them crack/pop). Then added onion, sauteed, followed by garlic (we use heaps of minced garlic). Added ground turkey (healthy and an amazinggg substitute in so many dishes!) and mashed it. I left in those juices from the turkey as we did not have broth. Then added salt and a can of diced tomatoes (not drained), and followed up with about 2 tsp of garam masala (essential ingredient!!!), 1/2 tsp tumeric, 1 tsp coriander powder and red chili powder to taste. Simmered on low for 20 minutes. My hubby is FROM India and he loved it!!! Definitely a quick tasty recipe... but go easy on the spices if you aren't a huge spice person!!

Very good. I doubled the sauce and added peas along with comino and some cayenne pepper for the hubby. No cucumbers or plain yogurt in my small town grocery so I had to settle for sour cream and chopped cilantro which I thought was very good.

This was AWESOME! But instead of lamb, I used ground beef, because I already had it. Tasted fantastic. Once the meat and seasonings were simmering, I added a little more tomato paste for moisture. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Boyfriend wants it again so it MUST be great. :)

I really enjoyed this dish.  I took the recommendations of the others and added the cumin, coriander, ginger, chili powder, cinnamon as well as the potatoes and peas.  I didn't add the curry only because I was out of it.  Next time I make this, I will definitely try it with the curry.  I  made it with basmati white rice.

So I had to make a lot of changes to this one that's why I only gave it 3stars. I used about 1 lb of lean ground beef. I used 2.5 tablespoons of Garam Masala, .25 tsp cumin, .25 tsp coriander, a dash of curry powder, and a little chipotle chile pepper to taste. I also added about a cup of diced potatoes. I left out the tomato, but kept the other ingredients. I served it with warm whole wheat pita bread. It was really good, and even better the next day. Will make again.

Very tasty dish.  A "keeper."  I didn't have tomato paste, so used tomato sauce...worked well.  Served with Basmati rice, Raita, and garbanzo beans.  Didn't need anything else for us.

Very flavorful.  This seems to be a very adaptable dish.  I used about 1 lbs of ground chuck since that's what I had dethawed the night before.  Didn't have any beef stock so I used chicken stock instead.  I think this made it a bit salty so next time I'll just use water.  Served it with cous-cous.

Didn't have ground lamb, so used ground turkey as one reviewer suggested.  It was very good.  Very easy to prepare.  Nice, different, quick way to cook ground meat.  We enjoyed it with jasmine rice and peas.

Easy and good. I made it quickly and as others suggested I added cinnamon sticks, cumin, and coriander, about 2 taps of each. Cooked my potatoes in beef broth in the microwave while the beef cooked, so it came together in about 25 minutes. I served it on naan with feta (had no paneer) and it was great.

I enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. I love Indian spices and flavors but it was a teensy bit hotter than my preference. So I may cut back on the garam masala next time.

Nice change of pace but simple to make.  I made it with ground beef and added spices as other suggested.  I had it with rice and wish I had some peas to put in it.  I will next time.

This was good.  But as the author implied, what I am most struck by is the versatility of this.  You could literally use it in almost any Indian dish or side item.  I used ground bison instead of lamb and added spicy chick peas served with/on Naan bread.  Everyone loved it!

We like spicy so I added more masala & pepper/cayenne pepper mix with peas & served over sautéed cabbage for more veggies.

Very close to what my mom used to make and has become a family staple. I use a couple tbsp of curry powder and a can of tomatoes , breaking up the large tomatoes as it cooks. Like others, I also use ground beef and frozen peas.

We all thought this was good, but needs a spicy sauce.  My husband added a pepper relish he'd made earlier and decided it all tasted wonderful.  Will make this again.

First, I made it as the  recipe said and I tasted it but it needed a little something.  So I read the other reviews and added a bit more garam masala.  Still needed something so I added cumin, corriander and the peas as was suggested.  I also threw in some red pepper flakes and tad more salt and it was delicious over rice. Very tasty and quick meal.  Thank you for sharing.

Great and easy to make on a week night.  My husband said it was a keeper.  My son likes it but thought it was too spicy.  Although he is having it for his after school snack today!  I too liked it a lot.  I did add frozen peas at the end.  It was a tad spicy for me too but Im a light weight.  This will be added to my rotation!  Thanks,

I used ground beef because I had it on hand.  I'm glad I found this recipe because it is really nice to do something different with ground meat.  I added 1/2 tsp of cumin per suggestions.  My family really like it.  I will make this again.

I used ground beef/sirloin and added all the extras. As previous reviews suggested (cumin, curry, peas, cinnamon stick and more broth). I also added bay leaf and cause I wanted a creamy broth I added coconut milk and also sauteed the meat then the onion/garlic in coconut oil. I enjoyed the flavor as did the fam. I would make it like this again for sure.

First time attempting a new style of cooking...I used ground turkey and like some others, I cut garam Marsala in half and added a little cumin, red pepper, and curry powder! I put it over brown basmati rice and I made a homemade Greek yogurt cucumber sauce to go with (also from AR)! Served with some naan on the side... yummy!

It was edible, but I don't like cinnamon in savory food. The Garam masala includes cinnamon and I think it would have been better (although not authentic) without it. I put it over mashed potatoes and threw on a bunch of hot sauce to hide the flavor of the cinnamon.

Really good !!! Easy to make and so  versatile !! Lots of different ways to make this or add stuff to it. Like previous reviewers I added some extra spices like curry powder ( hot Madras ) and added some cumin. Put peas in with it ( next time diced potatoes) and served it over rice. Yum !!!!

this is a great recipe  &  just like the other reviews said ad some more seasonings about 1tbs spoon cumin,  curry,  ginger &  red pepper flakes in the season sauteed the onions I also  added mushrooms ,  since I used 2lb of ground lamb I added more gran masala and a small can of tomato paste . I poured in a whole can of beef broth , and 1 cup of slurry water & corn starch to thicken ,  2 teaspoon of minced garlic.. I then let it all simmer  & thicken put in some whole frozen kernal corn.. I also added few dashes of chili powder.. All this should be done to taste . I served this over whole grain egg noodles and also made rice  to serve it over.. Both taste wonderful  if you want it to be light eat w/ noodles if you want to be more full eat rice...

This was great! But I modified the receipe by using ground beef instead of ground lamb.  I couldn't find the garam masala spice in my local grocery store, so used a combination of red curry, pepper, marjoram, and cumin (about 1/4 teaspoon of each spice).  With the leftovers, I made meat pies with Pillsbury dough cresants.  I flattened the raw triangular dough, filled with a table spoon of meat filling, and baked for about 12-15 minutes on 350.  These pies were a great snack after Sunday service.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Next time I will go to an international store for the garam masala spice to compare the dishes.

This is one of our go to dishes now, especially since we have so much lamb.  We use the actual recipe as the foundation and the comments for tweaking.   We add more garam masala to taste.  We also add a light TBSP of cumin to the lamb while it's browning, and maybe a 1/2 TBSP of coriander at the very end.  Again, all to taste.  We also fold in frozen peas (a cup or two) and a few diced, already cooked potatoes and some of the potato water to the simmer.  I no rice but my husband likes a side of rice with it as well.  Next time we will add chili powder to bring the heat up a notch.  But do yourself a favor and make this recipe.  Very easy and so so good.

Delicious, with some add-ons. I read several reviews and decided to add in the other recommended spices. I added cumin, coriander, curry ( i bought in bulk at Central Market), a touch of cayenne and a little cinnamon. I also used ground beef and pork instead of lamb, as it's cheaper. Absolutely wonderful! Forgot - add fresh Ginger.

Very tasty recipe.  I made it with lean ground beef and extra broth.  I also added peas. I do recommend upping the spices a bit. Served over rice.

This is a simple dish to be made on a busy day. I've made this with minced chicken and omitted the broth. I've also made some changes like the others recommended.  I have used minced garlic, onion and ginger. Added chili paste, tumeric , cumin and chili paste. Also added 3 tablespoon of coconut milk. The taste was awesome.

I made this recipe with ground beef, and followed the spices exactly as written.  It smelled great, but tasted blah.  We eat Indian food often, and this recipe just didn't cut it.

Add more spice to flavor the dish: Coriander, Cardamon, Curry Powder, Cinnamon and Garam Marsala. Also add par boiled potatoes and frozen peas. Simmer it down and keep adding beef stock until flavors marinate. Serve over rice, YUMMY!

This is very good and an unusual dish for me.  I followed directions exactly - yet added additional broth to the recipe.  Spicy and Delicious !

I really like this dish! I did less than half of my garam masala substitute and it was still spicy, so do add a little at a time while tasting as you go to ensure you don't over do it! A great inspiration recipe that you can add to if you desire, which is what I did. 
I took the author's advice and added veggies: frozen mix of peas, carrots, corn & green beans, sweet potatoes, celery & cauliflower serving it with buckwheat instead of rice.
I substituted and added other ingredients according to what I didn't have, etc: ground beef instead of lamb, 1/2 packet of onion soup mix instead of onion, 1.5 tsp Chana Dal masala instead of 2 Tbsp garam masala & added 1.5 Tbsp yellow curry (I cannot handle hot spice, hence the decrease), 1/4 tsp sea salt (reduced salt due to type & using onion soup mix), increased tomato paste to 5.5 fl oz can adding 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup whole milk (due to increased volume of dish b/c of added veggies, & to help reduce spiciness).

As a base for a recipe this is a good start. I also did as others suggested, adding cumin, clove, curry powder and peas. Made for a tasty, fast meal.

This recipe helped me achieve the tastier ground meat that I've ever cooked myself!  Since I live alone and don't have many ingredients in my tiny kitchen, I substituted garam masala for Italian Seasoning and instead of beef broth I poured a small bag of Latin American Sofrito into the skillet. Guess the results are not Indian at all but very yummy nonetheless!

I did not care for this recipe. As an Indian, I would say this had a distinct sawdust flavor.

As written, this is pretty boring. I added some cumin, ground coriander and turmeric. Also threw in some browned cubes of paneer. Turned out ok. Thanks.

I thought I liked Indian food but I guess I was wrong.  As another reader said, the garam masala had way to much of a floral taste, and I love lamb, but for some reason I was creeped out by this dish.  The only good part was the naan.  This might not come as a surprise but I definitely won't be making this again.

Great recipe.  My husband ate the whole thing and wants me to make it again.  I did add some cumin and coriander.  Perfect.

I added a few table spoons of Curry powder and didn't add the peas. It turned out really good but REALLY hot. Next time, I will add less spices.

I didn't have lamb or beef broth, so I used ground beef and chicken broth. It was really easy and even though didn't look so great, the taste was really good. Everyone at the table (about 10 pple)loved it! Most of us ate it over rice. It was great! thnx for the recipe!Also thanx to cheepchick who recommended it to me!

Yum! I'm actually enjoying it as I type. Now that I know how it turns out I'll try adding additional flavors that other reviews recommended. Thank you!
