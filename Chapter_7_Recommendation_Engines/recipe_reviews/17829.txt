I was very pleased with the flavor and texture of this teacake; the amount of chocolate seemed just right for a quickbread (not too heavy as in a browny). The taste of the hazelnuts really comes through. Perfect for a ladies lunch or nice brunch. To make it more convenient by using my mixer, I beat the eggs, vanilla & sour cream in my mixer's work bowl, tossed the flour, baking soda & powder on a sheet of wax paper and added to eggs in mixer, mixed briefly, then added melted chocolate mixture, mixed briefly, last folded in hazelnuts by hand - turned out great.  Made three mini-loaf pans (2"x5"x2.5"), baked for 30-35 minutes. A keeper!

Great recipe. It's moist, flavorful, and rises nicely in the pan to about twice the size the batter was. I made a (small) bundt cake as a birthday cake for my daughter. I coated the outside with dark chocolate to keep it from drying out too quickly. Although i usually bake with a hand mixer, i only used a wooden spoon to make the dough ... and it came out perfectly without much work.

Really did not like this.  Brought it over to a family dinner and nobody liked it.  I can't exactly put my finger on what it was.  Maybe it was the fact that it was a cross between a brownie and a cake.  If it was one or the other it would've been better.

Excellent! I had to substitute cocoa powder since i didn't have any baking chocolate, but just slightly upped the butter and it was perfect. Will use again!

I made this to use up some leftover ground hazelnuts, too (bought too much over christmas). 
Wonderful teacake consistency; it was very moist and not too crumbly. I'd prefer it with a little more chocolate, but the amount of hazelnut was perfect; enough for the flavour without making the cake dry.
I was planning on keeping some for my coffee tomorrow, but it disappeared far too quickly!
