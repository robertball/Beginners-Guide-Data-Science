This turned out great- the meat nearly fell off the bone, and this is only my second turkey ever to make. I made it as written, except I accidentally forgot the celery. I had to make my own Soul Food seasoning (via the help of another member)using: 2 T ground pepper, 2 T garlic powder, 2 T onion powder, 2 T chili powder, 1 t dried parsley, 1 T paprika, 1 T salt, 1 t ground thyme, 1 pinch cayenne pepper, and 1 t celery seed. I took the suggestion of another review and thickened the juices with a bit of flour, some sour cream, and a generous amount of black pepper to make a really good gravy.  My dad said this turkey was better than his mom's, and that's huge.

OMG!  This was the best turkey ever.  I admit that I am not a big roasted turkey fan so I'm  always looking for new twist to spruce up a normally dry and tastless main course.  This recipe did just that. It was easy to do the night before and it was gorgeous when it came out of the oven.  I'm still getting phone calls for visitors about how moist and tasty the turkey was.  I was expecting that the salt in the bacon would be too much but it was totally neutralized.  I have never had a turkey fall off the bone will trying to carve it.  This recipe is worth 10 stars but I can only give 5.  P.S.  Soul Food seasoning...is the same thing as McCormick's Seasonal or Lawry's Season Salt.  I compared the labels.  Eat and be Merry!

My very first turkey, and it got raves from the family!!!  Of necessity I made my own soul food seasoning, left off the bacon, and used a roaster instead of a bag (I had it cover and basted it a few times.)

I used the drippings, a dolop of sour cream and flour mixed in warm water to make the gravy....it was great.

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

Over the years, we have cooked about 32 Thanksgiving dinners. I tried this recipe 2006, and it is the very best recipe by far. The turkey was mild and very juicy. Maybe it helped that we wrapped the turkey in aluminum foil. We removed it the last 50 minutes to get it brown and crispy.  It was DELICIOUS !

Nowhere did I read 2# of bacon for a 22# turkey.  If you choose not to have 1# of bacon on an 18# turkey--either use less or another recipe.  If you have not tried the original recipe--mouth shut!  Only want your info if you have tried THIS RECIPE.  Thank you

This turkey was wonderful, very moist. It was the best turkey I have ever fixed. I did have to cut up the veggies, apple and orange so they would fit in the cavity.  Again, it was terrific!!

I wanted to have a juicy turkey this year, because every other year its so dry. I ran across this recipe and gave it a try. The turkey was so good, tender and juicy. Everybody loved it and said it was this best ever. We're gonna start doing this every year.

This turkey was amazing!!  We did change things up a little bit for our puposes, but were very happy with the results!  Once we stuffed the turkey with everything listed in the recipe we filled the cavity with a bottle of pinot grigio and poured the rest in the pan.  We prepped the turkey with regular poultry seasoning instead of the soul food seasoning, and initially baked the turkey breast down (upside down) for 4 hours, basting and injecting with the wine and turkey drippings in the bottom of the pan.  At the 4th hour we flipped the turkey, added the bacon, reduced heat to 300, and baked for 2 more hours.  By far, this was one of the most tender and flavorful turkeys I have ever eaten!!  We garnished the platter with sliced apple and orange to give a great color!

AMAZING! This was my third turkey in my home and I really wanted something with great flavor and was juicy! THIS IS IT! I do not use a turkey bag, and it has been great every time I use this recipe. I have also used the onion, celery, apple, orange, carrot, and seasoning for a simple whole chicken....AMAZING! Thank you, Sherry!

Made the best turkey I ever had or prepared. The meats is very flavorful and juicy. Even though it's cooked in an oven bag, the skin still comes out very crisp and brown.  Will definitely make again.

This is the first turkey I have ever made and I will not be looking for a different recipe. Makes the best bacon-turkey sandwiches!
Also, use leftover meat for turkey and dumplings.

Made this for my Thanksgiving crowd and it was a complete hit. I  have found my signature turkey preparation for every year! I cooked it upside down for half the time - then flipped it over. Also I cooked it and took it out of the oven. We covered it with foil and then completely draped it with a folded up quilt. Uncovered and carved about 2 hours later - it was hot, juicy and delicious!

I used this recipe to make my very first turkey and have used it several more times at other family functions - everyone who has had it has been a very big fan. I followed the recipe exactly and used the soul food spice recipe from one of the comments on this page. The only thing I change up is I cut up the fruits and veggies before I stick them in the turkey. It's always come out tender and the meat just falls right off of the bone. 

Try this recipe, I promise you wont be sorry!

I followed this recipe exactly, as I always do with new recipes. This was, without a doubt, the BEST turkey I've ever cooked. We used a 13 lb. Butterball and adjusted the amounts accordingly. The family raved and the four of us ate this turkey in two days. Succulent, flavorful, and fork tender, tender, tender! Absolutely wonderful. Thank you, Sherry!!!!

Interesting recipe, as in the "Soul food" spice rub (with the ingredients as noted by another reviewer) was was well worth making,definitely a keeper for poultry rubs, very complex flavour.  I'll be making more of that.

I solved the bacon overcooking problem with a simple foil tent sorta idea about 1/2 hour in.  The bird and bacon came out nicely browned.

That all said, I wouldn't bother making this again, the bacon fat overpowered everything, and really, if you want to taste bacon, don't bother with the stuffing at all, grease/oil will cover citrus and apple flavours every time.

The bird was very moist, but I think that's more about the cook in bag technique and the quality of the turkey in the bag than using a bacon wrap.

My roommate and I made this, with an addition of spices between the skin and meat, and a substitution of lemon for orange.  We cooked it under a foil tent because we didn't have a bag.
It came out amazing.  The meat fell of the bone, it is delectable and juicy.  I didn't intend to change the recipe, really, I just didn't have an orange and Steve Reichlen recommends the spices under the skin.

Everyone loved it.  A big hit. Brining is the key...and the bacon helps too.  The fruit may have added moisture...but we did not detect their flavor.

Been using the cavity filler for years so the only thing new for me in this recipe was the addition of the bacon which for me did not add a lot of flavor. Might try it again but was not really that excited about it in the end.

Simply Delicious - and the Aroma it filled the house with was to die for !!  I used 2 packages of Applewood bacon (created an 18ib "Bird in Bondage") - inserted a rack into the cooking bag first...then the Bird - and in alittle over 4 hrs she was done to perfection...browned all the way around with no greasy bottom...tender, moist and oh so very Tasty !!

Sounds great. Hope my hubby will let me make this next yr. He doesn't normally like fruit with meat.
To lmh32683, when you have drippings, you need to separate the fat out from the other liquid. There is a fat separater cup, you can buy. I just get a large spoon & skim the top; that is where the fat stays. Hope this helps.

Yummy!  I used this recipe last Thanksgiving and it was so good.  My family was happy.  I will only add that it seemed as though there was much more liquid and my pan didn't hold it all.  I had a mess in the oven from it.  Be sure to use a roasting pan or something very deep.

All the flavor went into the meat and made it taste, gamey. It was very tender, but I was a bit disappointed that it fell apart when we tried to take it out of the bag. Also, the bacon was very dark, not burnt, but I would watch out for that next time. My mom was surprised that it turned out so crispy, the turkey I mean. Good recipe overall.

This was fabulous!  I had never made a turkey before and I made this in my crockpot because I had to work and that seemed the easiest way to cook it without drying it out while I was gone.  I got rave reviews from all guests and several said it was the best turkey they EVER ate and it wassooo juicy and tender.  I will use this recipe again.

This what the first turkey I have ever made. I had received a turkey from my fiance's mother and immediately started looking for recipes. I received this recipe in an email and decided to give it a try.
I had an 18 pound bird so this recipe was perfect for it. I found it a little difficult to get the ingredients inside the turkey. 
After cooking, my fiance did the honors of carving it up. It literally fell off the bone! He said it was the best turkey he ever had---even the breast was fairly moist. 
The only issue I had was that I will probably cook it half an hour longer next time, and rub the spices under the skin of the breast for even more flavor. Overall, a delicious bird.

I was so excited because it was just the 2 of us and I bought a tiny turkey of 11 lbs and thought sure I could handle it.  My history with turkey has not been good, to say the least.  But, with no company, I was sure it would be different.  I followed the instructions with the vege's and fruit.  I even found "soulfull" seasoning (which turned out to be very tasty).  Everything was going great, turkey should have been done in 3 hours and the sides had been timed accordingly.  Well, guess what?  My poor history with turkey's continues.  I cooked the turkey upside down!  The result was that the breast wasn't done, or brown.  Had to cook the turkey for another hour and that threw all the sides off.  My husband was watching football and didn't help, so I blamed him and that made me feel a little better. However, the end result was a delicious turkey, and if I ever attempt another turkey (which is doubtful), I will definitely use this recipe.

Okay, so I'm not a great cook, but....Here's my recap of making this turkey.  Followed everything except I don't especially care for orange so I used a lemon instead...love lemon.  I didn't put the butter under the skin (rubbed with olive oil and seasons) because I thought that would be too much fat.  In hindsight I probably should have.  But it still turned out to be a nice turkey.  The white meat was a little dry...as always (I think I cooked it a little too long), but it was a great turkey.  I was concerned by one reviewers remarks that the turkey tasted like bacon (I used one regular pkg from the store for a 13lb turkey)...but, in fact the bacon tasted like turkey!!! I did use a bag.  So that's my report, hope it helps!!

This turkey came out really good and moist. I stuffed mine and put a couple pieces of the bacon under the skin then layered the rest on top. They best part about this is how easy it is. Only took me about 10 minutes to rinse it, stuff it and get it into the oven. And because it's in a bag you don't have to touch it until its done. :)

My family loved this.  I hate white meat because it is so dry, but the white meat was moist.  I even ate some of it.  Really very simple recipe.  I could not find soul seasoning, so I used Morton's season salt and restaurant style pepper.  I also did not use a bag.  I put turkey in my big roasting pan and tented with aluminum foil.  Some one else did this and I also followed their advice to remove the foil the last 50 minutes of cooking time.  The turkey was already browning, but this put a nice color to it.  Since my mom is on a low sodium diet, I used one lb. of low sodium bacon, and the salt level was just enough.  Family loved turkey this way so will continue to use this recipe.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would...we have fried, smoked and had the traditional turkey through the years and this is by far the best turkey I have ever had. My son weaved the bacon with 2 lbs of bacon and it was fabulous..very moist and flavorful! We will make this recipe every year!

This is my first review and I'm only doing it because I am so excited about it.  This turkey came out so good... talk about fall off the bone.  It really did!  The gravy wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping, but I think next time I wouldn't skim ALL the fat off of the drippings!  I did have to cut all the fruit and veggies for them to fit in the cavity. But honestly, didn't change a thing.  Thanks for making our holiday special with this recipe.  I will do it again!

My mother in law taught me this method of roasting a turkey 35 years ago and I have never deviated.  I do not although put it in a bag.  Funny thing the bacon never makes it to the table. My husband is the happy picker as he carves the bird.
My first turkey 40+ years ago came out like shredded wheat! So I guess I have learned a thing or two. hehe

Just wanted to add a little trivia, that draping a piece of meat with bacon or salt pork before roasting is a very old technique called "barding".  Sounds delicious.  Also wanted to tell user Ppquat that users of this site are allowed to make revisions to a recipe, and still rate it, so how about YOU, stop being rude.  Thanks!

Certainly a nice way of cooking a turkey if you prefer that method. Expect a good amount of fluid in the bag, the fact of the matter is that you are actually steaming the bird rather than dry roasting.
And of course it is a matter of taste and my opinion is there is nothing at all like a dry roasted turkey. 
In addition, the use of a pound of bacon will most certainly result in " bacon flavoured " gravy.

this is sooo good.  the only change we made was covering in tin foil for all except the last half hour instead of a turkey bag.   you can really taste the orange/citrus in the meat and its even better the second day and cold (according to my husband).  We did the recipe ahead of time to 'test' it before the big day and its def. a keeper!

The turkey came out extremely moist and flavorful.  Ironically the turkey was difficult to carve due to the fact the meat was falling off the bone as the knife touched it.  Everyone enjoyed it immensely.  I personally am not a big fan of bacon, but the turkey under the bacon was delicious and those who liked bacon asked for more.

Awesome turkey!  Guess you can't go wrong with bacon, lol.  Gravy from the dripping comes out fantastic, too.  The fruit juices along with the bacon drippings give it a really great flavor.

This turkey is the best ever and I have roasted some wonderful turkeys. It is amazingly tender and juicy. Fixing it again for Christmas today and my fam cannot wait. Also, the simple sour cream gravy Amy Louise suggested with it was also off the chain !

I needed something new to do with the old bird I had in freezer since April and I did not want to do a tradfitional STUFFED bird, seems I am the only fan around!! I LOVE bacon on anything and have had and made baked chicken similiar to this method so I gave it a whirl.... IT WAS AWESOME, melt off the bone... I choose a covered roaster over the bag method but sealed lid down with a strip of foil for the first two hours then basted bird every 30 minutes there after until it reached temp... I would suggest using a thick cut bacon or over-laying if you are using a thinner cut , I used a 3lb box of ends and peices and layered bird with 2lbs or better of it after all its the fat and water content you are wanting from bacon. I also skimmed some of the fat off cooking juices since I over baconed if that's possible, then I made my gravy.

Took to hubby's office potluck, didn't have any left overs to take home even though there was another turkey, and two hams...
I wouldn't make it just for us, but a major party hit.
We usually roast in our large roasting appliance, but with the bacon this doesn't work well, you need it in the oven to brown the bacon evenly.
Thanks for the recipe!

I used the recipe today, and the turkey turned out wonderful!! I used a brown sugar mixture from grill mates to season the turkey because I did not have soul food seasoning. My entire family loved the turkey and thought having bacon on top was a plus. I read someone's review that the turkey did not brown in the bag. My turkey did brown in the bag and the bacon was crispy. I used Reynolds turkey bags. The turkey was not dry at all and gave a lot of juices to make excellent gravy from. The reason why I did not give all 5 stars, is because the meat was to tender. If that makes sense. Some parts of the turkey fell apart. I will use this recipe again.

At age 50th I cooked my first turkey, never had the need to cook one before. Because we always spend holidays with family. But, I tried this recipe and it is by far five stars. Moist, tasted great, looked just like the picture. The bacon gave it a smoke taste. One thing I did do different I stuff my turkey with seasonings a month before I cooked it.

This recipe saved our Christmas...what a wonderful bird!  We brined our bird first, then followed this recipe.  It was moist, tender, savory!  My mother-in-law tends to be a bit of a picky eater and she even had seconds.  This will be our "turkey recipe" from now on.

I didn't use a turkey bag, used thick cut smoked bacon and wove the strips over my 16 lb. bird.  Not only was this the prettiest bird I have ever done, it was by far the juiciest and most delish!!!!

I made this Turkey recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  I brine the Turkey for 18 hrs in the Orange Turkey brine recipe from this website, and then smoked the turkey for about 6 hrs in my smoker.  The bacon infused a wonderful flavor throughout the turkey.  I got a lot of compliments on the turkey.  Everyone came back for seconds on the turkey.  The only problem was we didn't have very much turkey left over for the next day.

This was such a fantastic turkey. Everyone in my family absolutely loved it. It came out so juicy and tender. I didn't have soul food seasoning, so I just used Lawry's seasoning salt and added some garlic powder and onion powder. It turned out great!!! Definitely a keeper. Thank  you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe. :-)

This was a great recipe.  Some other reviewer referred to this technique as barding which I read more about before attempting this recipe.  My 27 pound turkey turned out perfect and was photo worthy.  I tented the turkey with tin foil instead of putting it in an oven bag.  Because barding bastes the bird for you, you don't really need the oven bag.  It was the easiest way to cook the bird and have it so unbelievably moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was way too good!  So tender it fell off the bone. It didn't take as long to cook as I calculated so we ate earlier than expected.  I love the fact there was minimal cleanup after too!  Gotta try this one, you won't regret it.

I made this today minus the bag for the turkey, as I didn't have one. It was amazing. The gravy was so flavorful. The house smelled wonderful!!! The bacon was so crispy. I got lots of compliments on the meal. I think it would have been moister if I had used the bag, but was still yummy!!! Lots of people asking for the recipe!!!

This was OUTSTANDING! I hate turkey, I only take it because I am obligated to one day a year, I geerally approach the Thanksgiving table focused on the side dishes. However, this recipe changed my life. I discovered I love turkey today as long as I make it this way. It's no wonder why bacon is everyone's best friend.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

It's only my husband and myself tomorrow so I'm cooking a 6 1/2 lb breast in the crock pot while we're at the football game (GOOO LIONS!!)  Do you think this would work if I put everything under the breast since I can't stuff it?  And do you think I should add some water at the start of cooking?  HELP  please!!

I made turkey for Thanksgiving and enjoyed it with one exception.   I think in the future will replace the orange with another apple or maybe a lemon/lime.   I did not care for the orange taste in the meat.

Very good and moist. I did make a paste of butter and seasoning instead of using oil, I force the paste under the skin and on the top as well. I also inject the breast and legs with a salt water syringe. Otherwise followed the recipe.Love the bacon idea. I had to use foil as I did not have a bag.

This the best turkey I've ever made and I've made a lot. I'm 60 and I've always been the house cook. Last year a wealthy family essentially employed me to cook for them during the week (busy executives) so I know my way around. I used to have a turkey recipe that entailed wrapping it in bacon and was quit similar to this but this one went a couple of stages further. The apple and the orange are inspired and using a roasting bag really completes the process. I just had a generic Safeway cheapest 12.5lb turkey and I used it with this recipe. I just pulled it out of it's shrink wrap after it sitting in the fridge for a couple of days and prepped it as per the recipe. The bacon (Safeway thick cut bulk pack) salted and auto basted the turkey. The fruit steamed from the inside and the orange, apple and rosemary sprig gave it a nice seasonal fragrance. Prepping this took no time. No brineing, no special rub, no suicidal deep fryer. Just assemble as listed and slap it in the oven. It cooked a bit quick so keep an eye on it. Mine turned out 45 minutes early but I just decanted the stock,  left it in it's bag and wrapped it up in towels. It rested while I did everything else. Creamed sweet potatoes, roasted baby yukons, dressing, sauted brussels, Yorkshire puds,and steamed balsamic red cabbage. As to the stock, I made a rou and integrated the stock for perfect gravy. When I finally carved the bird the breasts were perfectly moist and perfectly cooked and the legs were not overdone. If

I made this recipe for Christmas day and got rave reviews on my turkey. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, like other reviewers, and it turned out fabulous. I used about 1.5 lbs. of bacon for an 16 lb. turkey. Basically I covered my turkey in bacon, once I had put it in the roaster, covered it with the lid & cooked it until the meat thermometer read 185 degrees. It made awesome gravy too. Neither the turkey nor the gravy was greasy at all. I used maple smoked bacon, not sure if that made a difference or not. I can't wait to cook a chicken or another turkey this way. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

So get this my mom fell broke her hip and congrats I am expected to make the turkey. Which for the record never have done. I saw this recipe last night fell in love and made it today! Not only did I successfully do the recipe but they loved it more than how they have been cooking it. My brother couldn't get over how moist it was! Only bad news is I'm expected to cook it next year no debates!

I have never made a turkey before, but my husband challedged me to try it- and THIS recipe is AWESOME! Turkey came out very moist and delicious, the meat just fell off the bone when we tried to carve it. I was very worried about the combination of flavors but I should not have been. Absolutely incredible recipe, thank you!!

**I did not have, and could not find, Soul Food Seasoning. I Googled the ingredients instead and sprinkled a little bit of each all over the turkey.

This will be the 3rd year I've made the turkey this way.  Everyone that tries it loves it.  The taste is fantastic and it is so moist.  I will never make a turkey another way!

This turkey was Da Bomb.  It was easy to marinade and all I had to do was place it in a bag and 3.5 hours later, I had a slammin turkey.  My guests loved it and now I am going to use the carcass for a throw down soup.

Seriously the BEST turkey I've ever made and the gravy it made was amazing.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and fresh rosemary, thyme and sage instead of soul food seasoning.

My guests were raving about the turkey and begging for the recipe.  

And it give a whole new meaning to the term "turkey bacon!"

Made for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it.  The meat was tasty and moist and the drippings made great gravy.  This will be my go to turkey recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I think the flavor was outstanding, but the use of the cooking bag was difficult. My bacon browned too fast on some of the pieces so I had to cut open the cooking bag to take those piepces off so that they wouldn't burn and give a burnt taste to the whole bird.  Then when I went to take it out of the bag it was cumbersome and kept sticking to the bag despite using fancy turkey lifters and 2 sets of hands (me and my hubby). I think next time I will try it without the bag.  I will also not use the same amount of bacon unless I have the same size bird as called for in the recipe.  I'm one of those people who thinks there's no such thing as too much bacon.  But in this case a pound of bacon for a 13# turkey was probably too much, hence the variable cooking times on the different pieces. I slightly layered my bacon to make it all fit. The flavor was good enough to try this one again.  And oh man the slightly bacony flavor in the gravy that I made from the drippings!  WOW!! I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars b/c it was better than 4 but I just can't give it a 5 b/c of the technical difficulties.

Excellent recipe! Followed the directions with two exceptions: A) used a roasting pan with a tip, and B) used a butter sage & thyme sauce between the sink and meat.  Will be making it again at Xmas. The stuffing was a chestnut sausage, onion, liver, dried cranberry with brown bread with raisins.

Awesome twist to a turkey dinner. I love not having to baste. I was able to put the turkey in and nap before the festivities.

This made a MOIST turkey.  I cooked it in the pressure cooker, and the flavor was wonderful.  It was a giant turkey so I was afraid it would be dry, but this did the trick.  I used the apple, celery, onion and carrot, and used seasoned salt and pepper.  I wonder if stuffing doesn't actually dry your turkey out?  This was supermoist and wonderfully tasty!  Next time I must have the orange too.
