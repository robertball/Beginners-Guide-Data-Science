My family LOVED this recipe.  I should note that I used hoagie rolls, instead of the sliced bread that was called for.  I also omitted the hot sauce - not intentionally, but I discovered I was out when I went to make these.  I think the pepper jack cheese has more than enough pep and I will not be adding the hot sauce in the future.  I used 24 oz. of sauerkraut and doubled the mustard, barbecue sauce.  I was able to make 7 sandwiches out of this.

Excellent taste - sauerkraut is the key~  I made this recipe though with a large garlic loaf browned as usual rather than just bread.  Mmmm.....

What a delicious blend of ingredients for the sauerkraut mix. My roast beef was sliced thin but not shaved. I had my broiler on lo and they took 4 minutes to be light brown on top and they were heated through and through. Husband added mayonnaise to his bread, the rest of us did not. I tried both and it is good both ways.

I'd broil it for maybe 2 minutes, but it was fantastic! I thought the sauerkraut would overwhelm the sandwich, but it balanced well with the dijon and bbq sauce! I added some pepperoni slices under the meat as well as pepperjack cheese on top, and it was perfect!

I never would have thought of bbq sauce going well with this type of sandwich, but it does!  It's a nice sweetness to go with the sour/tang of the sauerkraut and mustard.  I was going to make this open faced, but when I went to move the sandwich from the baking pan to a plate, I accidentally flipped it over and it was not pretty to look at anymore so I slapped the top bun on there.  Anyway, very tasty and different!

Really nice change of pace! Very easy, even if you heat the sauerkraut on the stovetop.  I wasn't sure if the sauerkraut was supposed to be drained or not; next time I'll drain it a little as it was a bit soupy. I added pepperoncinis and sliced tomatoes under the cheese. Great weeknight meal!
