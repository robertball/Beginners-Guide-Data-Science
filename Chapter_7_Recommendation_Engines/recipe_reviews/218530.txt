I enjoyed the idea of this cheesecake.  I made it in a 10" springform pan instead of a pie plate.  I found that the crust was too runny to create sides to the cheesecake (not really an issue).  The next time I make this, I will be making a couple of modifications - Oreo cookie crumb crust, cherry pie pilling instead of maraschinos.  As is, this is pretty tasty.  With these changes, possibly divine.

I combined two recipes. I used fresh tart cherries and add chocolate chips to the batter. It was super delicious and definitely worth making again.

The cheesecake was good, and the crust was delicious. I did have some trouble building up the edge, but letting it sit for a bit seemed to help. I think maybe a little less butter would make it easier.

I used a spring form pan, which didn't seem to cause any problems, or need too much additional baking time. I found the cherry sauce to be a bit mild, though. I would suggest maybe making a cherry sauce using fresh or frozen cherries with some sugar and thickener, as you would a pie filling. The sauce heated well (I used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken), but with the final product it was just over-powered by the cheesecake itself.
