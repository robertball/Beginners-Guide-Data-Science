Pretty good for a "dump" pumpkin cake! Very simple recipe. Just be careful of the time, because those pecans burn fast! Followed as written.

Thank you for being the only pumpkin dump cake using milk instead of evaporated milk. I wasn't  going to run out during a thinderstorm. 

Because I know my crew I didn't add nuts because I am the only one that likes nuts. This is a very forgiving recipe. I debated adding oats as a substitute and I am so glad I didn't. 

My whole family liked this. Having all 5 enjoy anything is wonderful. Thank you for the submission. Easy and delicious!
