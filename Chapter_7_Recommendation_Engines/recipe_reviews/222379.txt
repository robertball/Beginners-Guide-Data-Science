I love these in the summertime. Use 2 medium sized zucchini or approximately 1 lb., or 2 cups grated. I'm not sure if I didn't put the measure or weight when I submitted the recipe...sorry!

Really enjoyed these!  I measured 2 cups of grated zucchini as suggested by the submitter.  I wished i had grated more......next time.  Oh and also I used half chives and half green onions.

These were delicious!  Really nice combination of flavors and textures.  Highly recommend.  And a great way to use up all that abundant garden zucchini!

These are fantastic! I added 1/2 of a red bell pepper - so good! Will definitely make these again.

This turned out GREAT!!  I cooked on a stovetop griddle where I hardly used any oil.  My family loved these.  Thanks.

This was a good starting point but next time I would double the Old Bay and the feta ... good texture and flavor!

Fantastic! Instead of sour cream, I topped with a dill yogurt sauce.

Made these for dinner and my picky zucchini-hating husband loved them!  We were surprised at how filling they were. We plan to try again, adding garlic and substituting chopped spinach for the zucchini.

I added diced pimentos for more color but they still seem to be lacking flavor somehow.
