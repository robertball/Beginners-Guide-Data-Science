One Friday evening after a particularly trying work week, I made this.  I altered the recipe slightly; I added a whipped cream and a couple of swipes of nutmeg across my grater.  The effect was multidimensional.  The mug was warm in my hands, the heady aroma of nutmeg assailed my nose, the cloud of whipped cream was silky on my lips, and then the velvety taste of the coffee and Baileys slid across my pallet.  An immediate AHHHH reponse came over me, and all was right with the world once again.  Love this!

My husband & I can't wait for the Holidays because it's the only time I will let him buy Bailey's. Now it's just not the Holidays until the Bailey's has been cracked open!

This is our Thanksgiving and Christmas morning drink. My husband's parents always had this on those mornings, now so do my husband and I. It buffers the
chaos of those mornings. ;)

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......after a long day dealing with 2 teenage boys, this is just what the doctor ordered! It's also good on those "mornings after" for all of us who can't stomach beer remedies.

Delicious - when I am on vacation, I begin most mornings with one of these.  Didn't really consider it a "recipe," but if seeing it here will encourage more people to try it that's good :)  I first tried this on a vacation to St. Thomas, USVI and had it every morning of vacation thereafter.  Bailey's was pretty much the standard coffee creamer for my family and friends living on the island :)  Now this drink always reminds me of that place.  It takes me away.... :)

I used to make this for my after dinner dessert for my dates.  I would light the Irish cream and pour the hot coffee into the burning cream, then added whipped cream.  Very impressive--and great tasting!!

This is my beverage of choice on a cold evening when I can't get my feet warm. I add half & half (in the same amount that I usually add to my morning coffee) along with the Irish cream for a smooth, warming cuppa.

HMMMMMM!!  BTW @mnphouka the recipe doesn't say it's Irish Coffee. the title is Irish Cream and Coffee which is exactly what it is.

For those of you who like the flavor, but don't want the alcohol.  Use an Irish Cream flavoring by Torani.  It doesn't have the cream, but a dab of whipped cream will help.  The flavor is wonderful.  The flavorings can be found at most bar supply or wholesale markets.  Very reasonable also. A little goes a long long way.

My mother-in-law really got me into this drink. They always have Irish cream (heck, she's from Ireland). She likes to add a little half and half and some brown sugar to hers. However, I think it's perfect just like this. I try to keep this on hand in the fall/winter from now on.

Nothing to not love about coffee and Irish cream. 
I used Bailey's. Also added a teaspoon of espresso powder to my coffee as I enjoy the combination. 
A nice treat on a weekend or whenever you need something special.

A simple variation to coffee to celebrate St. Patrick's day.
