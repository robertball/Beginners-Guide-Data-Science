This is almost the same recipe that I make for Pork Colorado Green Chile.  The only difference is I do not use chile powder and I use 4 cups chicken broth rather than 5 cups vegetable broth. I prefer it with pork and without the chile powder .

Really you don’t use Hatch chilies to make a green chili in Colorado... you use a Pueblo chili so with that said this turned out wonderful using the meaty and firery Pueblo green chili. I am sure I changed the flavor profile some using New México dried red chili but that is how I like to make mine. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This is the best recipe I've found to make green chile. I use Pueblo chilies (how it should be!). I did this in the Instant Pot for 25 min and it tasted great!

I made this as listed and it is very good for a sauce over burritos, eggs, etc. as listed.  Yum!  We wanted to eat it more as a soup/stew so once done and tasted, we added some left over chorizo.  Oh, I did use chicken broth because I did not have vegetable broth.  Thanks for sharing!

I reduced the broth by 1 cup and increased the green chiles to 1.5 lbs.  I took it to a work build your own breakfast burrito potluck and got several requests for the recipe.

This recipe is so insanely spicy that it’s inedible. Hatch Chiles are way too hot in these proportions.  It should also be noted that you HAVE to wear gloves when slicing them. Otherwise your hands will be in agony for hours on end.

This doesn't really have the consistency of most chili recipes. But the flavor is nice.
