Surprisingly good! I sent my husband to the store for rhubarb and he came back with rutabaga. We had never tasted it before so decided to try this recipe. I'm glad we did. Don't have a potato masher so used a portable mixer and added enough milk so that it was the consistency of mashed potatoes. The uncooked shredded carrots adds a nice texture and taste. Will buy rutabaga and make this again!

Put your rutabaga in the microwave like a potato, let it cool and it will peel and chop with ease.

I'm always curious to try new veggies. Last night was the first time either my boyfriend or I had ever eaten a rutabaga... and we loved it! Thank you for a yummy and easy recipe, great for first-timers. Yes, rutabagas are not easy to chop up... but use a quality knife and put a little muscle in it! It's worth it! Preparing and cooking the rutabagas was very similar to making mashed potatoes: the boiling times are about the same, and mashing them is about the same. Thank You for making me a rutabaga lover. This will now be incorporated into regular meal plans.

This is a great recipe...a real plus to any dinner.  One tip, some readers said that they found it to be watery...I mashed the ingredients in a stand mixer and placed everything in a casserole.  I covered the casserole and baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  Hope this helps.

Using 1 large rutabaga, peel, cut into chunks and boil in water in large pan for 20 minutes, cool.
Using 2 large apples, peel, chop and cook in small pot with 2 TBSP sugar.
Place rutabaga and apples in casserole dish, sprinkle 4 TBSP honey over top and dot with butter.
Bake uncovered in 350 oven for about 35 minutes.
A good way to use up leftover rutabaga,  mash with cooked apples, butter and honey, warm and serve.

My husband enjoyed this recipe. I thought it was okay.  For some strange reason, my dish was quite watery and the milk didn't seem to blend as well as it should have.  After sitting for about 3 minutes, the milk sort of floated to the top and had to be mixed before each serving.  I finally placed it in the oven to try to dry it out...??

The rutabagas were REALLY hard to cut! I had to have my husband muscle them. Then they took quite a while to cook. The finished product tasted pretty good, but I don't think I'll make it again because it was so difficult. My 18-month-old son didn't really like it.

This was good, and I'll make it again. I did use brown sugar instead of white, just because it felt right.

Just awful! really truly not palatable, lacked flavor, poor consistency, raw carrot taste.  If you have the rutabagas already and you've had this kind of thing before and liked, that's the only way I could see anyone eating this stuff.  I can't get the taste out of my mouth!

I found this recipe to be OK.  My friend and I thought it was edible, but pretty bland.  I think if we had some meat along with it, it might have been a little better.

It was good but needs getting used to. Your brain tells you mashed potatotes. I will make this again. Maybe play up the sweetness.

I always add diced apple with a little sugar to rutabaga before mashing.
It adds a great flavor even for those who dislike "beggies".

I give this one star for effort. My husband and I agreed that this is the worst recipe I've tried.  I think the rutabaga would have been better plain than fixed like this. My husband never tried rutabaga before and I doubt that he will want to try it again for a long time.

simple and quick, Served it in 1/2 a steamed green pepper...make it a meal, vs side dish.  I'm not much of a sugar guy so I cut that back,  could have left it totally out too.   I'll make this or something similar again

Very good!  I'll definitely make it again.  I like the health component, too.

I used honey instead of sugar, and I added a half teaspoon of salt.  I found I did need to add the milk.

I like the idea of a previous poster to serve it with pork.  I think it would be good with roast chicken also.  I wouldn't serve it with beef, a little too heavy for a heavy meat.

This is my first experience cooking and eating rutabaga.  I hate it when people say a recipe is bland, but this one truly is.  It seemed to need something...maybe salt?  Neither my husband nor I cared for it.

I loved this, added s&p to taste and it was perfect. I took lindas advice and peeled the rutabaga, then steamed it (whole) in my pampered chef microwave steamer for 10 minutes, cut it up, then steamed it again along with the cut carrots until tender...thanks so much for the post!

I made the following changes to even out the taste. I added garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a pinch of celery salt, and a pinch of nutmeg. I also added about 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese.

This was okay.  I added a little nutmeg and sea salt after researching what spices go well with rutabaga.  I've never had rutabaga before, so not sure what I think about it.

perhaps it's just because I'm a southerner, but I found this recipe a little on the bland side.  I ended up sauteing the carrots (cut into matchsticks) and some onion in olive oil with fresh garlic, and I added ample pepper, salt, and a splash of balsamic vinaigrette to give it a little "oomph."  Still needs a little something else, though.  It was fun to try rutabagas!

I liked the first bite or 2 but it was quickly old after that!
