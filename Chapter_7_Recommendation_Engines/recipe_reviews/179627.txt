I didn't have the time to simmer for quite as long as the recipe called for, and I didn't have mint in the house, so I would like to try it again, but it was excellent!!!  I was leary about the amount of cumin, because I really don't like cumin, but I added the full amount and was very impressed.  Easy dish to make and extremely flavourful.  I definitely recommend it!!!

We really liked this very different dish.  I followed the recipe except I used ground turkey, added salt and served it over basmati rice.  Interestingly, I "Googled" Aush and learned that this is pretty close to the real deal.  All recipes called for pasta rather than rice, but since we prefer rice with this flavor combination, that's what I used.  Maybe next time I will go with pasta.

Really delicious. I used the recipe for easy garam masala from this site and it was delicious. I also added a tin of tomato paste and a cup or so of corn for personal taste. Will definitely make again.

The recipe was delicious. I followed it just as it is on here, except I added chopped cabbage (since I had half a head in the fridge) and about a tablespoon of brown sugar since it came out a tad bit spicy from the peppers flakes. It turned out delicious with a hint of sweet and spicy and YUM... :)

Awesome recipe.  Would be good with egg noodles instead of fettucine. Smells great while cooking and tastes just as good!  Thanks for this unique, yummy one!

I followed the recipe exactly except for using linguini instead of fettuccini. I thought it smelled amazing throughout the house. However, the flavours did not come out so much due to the lack of salt. I added some to our plates after tasting it, and it made a big difference. I don't know why, but pasta in this dish also felt a bit odd to me. I think I would make this sauce again but maybe with some basmati rice on the side or something. Also, I would cook it all in the same pot instead of in two pots, which means I would add the onions to the meat and continue this way, step by step, but all in one pot. I doubt it would make a difference, since I've done that to so many other recipes that asked for separate pots. Never made a difference!

This was ok, and it was fun to try something different.  I halved the recipe.  It was fairly spicy (my 5-yr-old wouldn't eat it), and the mint and nutmeg/cinnamon flavors were interesting.  I liked the fettuccine noodles.  I would add more chick peas if I make it again - they add nice balance to the spices.

Doesn't look anything like North American style chili so don't be expecting that.  Still delicious though!

Nice and spicy, just the way we like it. Very aromatic as it's simmering those 3-6 hours...and it tasted as good as it smelled. Thanks for the recipe...I didn't change a thing.

Easy, yummy, healthy.  Works well in the crockpot - just brown the hamburger first. As already noted, there is a recipe on allrecipes for "easy garam masala" if you don't have it on hand.

I liked this but would make a few changes next time. I would have liked more exotic taste.

Modifications this time: 
1) Used mostly ground lamb with only a little bit of beef 2) Used fresh mint rather than dried 3) Made it all in one pot, then transferred to the slow cooker after the browning parts of the recipe 4) Served with egg noodles 5) Added a bunch of much-needed SALT 6) Added a can of kidney beans in addition to the garbanzos

Next time I will: 
1) Use less chili powder--I feel like it overwhelms the middle eastern spices and makes it taste like American chili 2) Up the garam masala or add nutmeg for the same reason 3) Garnish with fresh mint

For as spicy as this recipe is (and it's quite zesty), it's a bit bland in the middle. Not sure what it is, but I'd for sure remove a bit of the garam masala.

Pretty good.  I thought it was a tad spicy for us; I'd cut back on the red pepper next time.  I also thought the chili powder and cumin overpowered the other spices, so I'd cut those down and increase the garam masala and the mint.  I love mint in meat dishes, and added some fresh at the table, but I thought it still needed more.  A very interesting variation on chili; thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was really good and not overly spicy.  I added extra garlic and used egg noodles.  I'd consider making this again!

It desperately needed salt and I made my own garam masala from this site, which I had to omit the cloves (allergic) and cardamom.  I also added 2 cans of garbanzo beans because I LOVE them.  It was incredibly awesome!

Such a great stew and a fun change from traditional ground beef dishes.  The only modifications I made were to use 2 cans of garbanzo beans, and slightly less cumin - 1 1/4ish tbsp.  Great flavor, no need for salt to please our palates.  We ate it over orzo, with a dollop of sour cream stirred in.  Perfect leftovers too.  Yum!

This was excellent, but I think only because I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp - more than that would have made this way too spicy.  I used ground turkey, doubled the garlic, used fresh chopped spinach and a half package (about 8 oz.) of whole wheat fettucini.  I didn't stir in the sour cream but rather just add a dollop when serving.  Oh, and because I didn't read through the recipe, I just added the pasta to the meat/tomato mixture and let it cook that way so I had to add a cup of water to have enough liquid to cook the pasta.  Really enjoyed this! A little exotic, very filling and relatively quick and easy to prepare.

Made this around Christmas time for a group of people.  It didn't go over very well.  In fact it was the only dish that was left over.  My daughter was the only one who appreciated it.

Terrific! Looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful. Used ground turkey. Didn't bother with pasta or rice. Didn't need it. Tried a dollop of plain Greek fat-free yogurt with it to replace sour cream. This was a nice extra. Also added a second can of garbanzo beans. 
Husband loved it. Will make again. Thank you Bonnie C.
Have made many times for friends & family. Everyone loves it.

This is yummy. Made some adjustments for what I had on hand. Added garlic powder (no fresh), commercial garam marsala, no cumin so I subbed whole coriander. Used home cooked garbanzos (so was probably a few more than in the original recipe), and fresh spinach (cause I needed to use it up. Cut back on the crushed red pepper as we don't do spicy. Served over whole wheat egg noodle (Red Mill)...great for a cold day in January...ooops forgot to mention did it on  top of the stove...

Delicious! Very flavorful and just the right amount of kick for us. I did make a couple of changes. I used methi leaves in place of mint, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and I cooked it for only two hours since my husband was hungry and the amazing smell wasn't helping his patience. We both agree this recipe is a keeper and I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

The unique taste was wonderful.  I substituted basil for mint and let it simmer 3 hours.  It made a lot more than 6 servings but I'm not complaining. Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipie.

This was OK, and the mint made it "interesting," and the garam masala lent an Indian taste to it.

Awesome Recipe! Read multiple reviews and decided to stick to the recipe as written as far as ingredients and measurements. Only change I made was start is all in one pot; browned ground tukery, onions and garlic 1st then added all the other ingredients. Then transferred to a slow cooker for 4+ hours on low and served over rice with sour cream on the side.  Loved the flavor combinations. Thanks Bonnie C ;-)

I used pappardelle pasta and definitely added some
Salt.  I also added some stewed tomatoes and a bit of water to keep it from drying out during its simmering.  My whole family really liked it.  Next time
I think I will use egg noodles.

This was delicious and even better the next day. I love spices/flavor, but I was skeptical about how much spice and the amount of mint that this recipe called for. I followed the direction for the ingredients. However, I started out slow with the herbs and spice. Overall, I used all the spices. I didn’t make Garam Masala, but added each spice separately. I only used half the amount of mint. The spice combination must work synergistically, because, no one spice stood out on the palate, but  what a unique flavor. I used cannellini beans, as I didn’t have garbanzo beans in my pantry. I cooked my egg noodles separately; I’m not a fan of mushy noodles. A dollop of sour cream before serving and the dish looked like the photo. My daughter loved it and so did I. Will certainly make again.

Made it per the recipe using butter noodles instead of linguine the recipe called for. Truly satisfying, interesting and flavorful. I did add salt and pepper which was definitely needed.

Loved this recipe!  I had this dish once in Morocco and this was just as delicious.  Thanks for letting me relive a foodie memory!

I cooked it in my crock pot on high for 4 hours.

I didn't have dried mint so I used 6 small drops of mint extract and it seemed just right.

I don't eat a lot of red meat so I ground some chicken.  There wasn't any extra liquid from browning it, and the mix looked a little dry so I added about 1/2 cup chicken stock.

This was quite a nice dish to make - very easy and flavorful! Instead of fettuccine, I used lentil pasta. I also could not find dried mint, so I used fresh mint (but less than what the recipe stated).

This was so good and easy to follow! I made a few adjustments - I don’t think very far ahead, so I couldn’t slow cook it, I used an insta pot instead. I added pre-soaked red beans and beef broth to make it more soupy, mine was not coming out soupy probably because I didn’t slow cook it? But it turned out great! Otherwise I followed to recipe :) This made a ton of food, if adding red beans I’d consider lower the amount of garbanzo beans added. We topped this on elbow macaroni in an attempt to get my toddler to eat it too, let’s see how it goes!

A very different take on chili.  I've made it twice, once with lamb, and once with beef, and couldn't tell much of a difference.  Changes I made:  used 2 cans of chickpeas, 1 tbsp red pepper flakes, plus a little extra of all the other spices.  Also used 10 oz of fresh spinach, but it becomes pretty much the texture that the frozen would be, so not sure there's much difference there. One time I used fat free plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, but wouldn't recommend that as it doesn't fully disperse fully and leaves little white specks througout.  Doesn't affect the taste, it just looks a little gross. The second time I used regular plain yogurt which works much better to just give it that creamy look.  This works well served plain without the noodles, but the second time I mixed in some orzo and liked that -- seemed to be a good compromise between rice and pasta.  This comes out a little watery in the end; maybe draining some of the tomato juice would help, or maybe it was just extra moisture from the fresh spinach.  Adding the orzo did appear to absorb most of the extra water after a while.

I made it with some changes due to lack of some ingredients and experimenting.  I cut the spices in half.  After browning the onions I added a half cup of sherry.  Didn't have the tomatoes so I used an extra can of beans, small tomatoe paste, cup of broth and the rest of 20 ounces of water.  I used chicken instead of meat.  My picky family loved it!

Great stuff. Did most of it in a  pressure cooker. Would be even better with ground lamb.

I've made this twice, my family really likes it. The second time I added salt, doubled the chick peas and didn't add the spinach until the last half hour of cooking. Both times I served with rice although i would like to try noodles. The sour cream was a bit too rich-tasting, we liked it better with a dollop of greek yogurt on top. Leftovers are great and it freezes well.

Wow! I like exotic food, but even this seemed like it would be strange/intriguing to me.  I followed the recipe faithfully (except for mint which I could not get), and it turned out very well. An unusual combination of flavors that works quite well. Yes, it is spicy. As a person who loves spicy food I thought it was perfect!

I really, REALLY liked this.  I made it almost exactly as written, except (1) used 2 cans of chickpeas, because we love them; (2) increased red pepper flakes to 1 tablespoon, because we like spicy; (3) added 2 teaspoons of salt, because other reviewers said it needed that; and (4) used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and didn't add it until the end of cooking time, because I didn't want it to turn to mush.  I used my slow cooker for this (6 hours on Low).  It smells heavenly while it's cooking, and tastes every bit as good.  One change I would make ... I think this has too much pasta, and I'd cut it back to 6-8 ounces next time (and there will definitely be a next time).

This was definitely different but very good. Followed the recipe exactly. We are not big salt lovers but we did add a little to our individual plates. I want to make this again with ground turkey, more beans and more spinach. We liked it a lot with the fettucine and it tasted great as left overs too.

This was good but a little too spicy for me, I would cut the red pepper a little unless you really love heat. It also needed some salt. Thanks!

It had too much nutmeg. Possibly made the wrong way.
