These were almost like a crepe batter at first. After allowing the flax to gel, they came out more like a pancake. They are pretty tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

Recipe as written is great! I wouldn’t change a thing. It’s a great alternative to traditional pancakes that do not agree with my stomach. Although thin, I made several, stacked them to the thickness of a regular pancake and enjoyed them just as much as a regular pancake.

I only used 2 eggs in this recipe, added 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed, and a dash of nutmeg.

They tasted phenomenal. I will definitely make them again. My  boyfriend is on a keto diet and we had been searching for a decent pancake recipe. This is the first one we've tried that will get made more than once!
