Tasty & fairly simple to make. I made a few modification because I was having more guests at dinner than I expected. Luckily I had extra artichokes, but I just added some ketchup and a tad more water to make up for more tomatoes. (I only did this to add ~ one serving. Not sure if it would work on a larger scale.)

I also served over rice instead of pasta because of my gluten allergy.

Everyone RAVED though. Tomatoes and lentils are a great combo, and artichokes add the perfect something extra!

Mmmmmm! Tomatoes and lentils are such a delicious combination!! This is a very good recipe...I tweaked it a tiny bit to our taste: Try with sauteed garlic, minus the green onions and substitute finely minced sweet spanish onion. Add fresh chopped parsley (about 2 tbsp)and 1/2 tsp crushed chili peppers. Top with curls of romano cheese right before serving (use a vegetable peeler). Enjoy!

I was a little unsure as to whether this recipe would have enough flavor but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very easy to throw together on a week night.  I didn't have any sesame seeds and used a little chopped yellow onion in place of the green.  It was a nice hearty easy meal.

I was unsure about this at first, but it is fabulous. It took longer for the lentils to get done though. My husband said this is a definate keeper.

Served with a green salad, this makes a good week night dinner.  It was easy to make, and adaptable.  I didn't have artichoke hearts, but I added a bit of stock to my (crushed) tomatoes.  I used red lentils instead of brown, yellow onion instead of green, and I added celery and garlic in with the onions.  I liked the taste that the sesame seeds added.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I skipped the cayenne pepper (for the kids) and added roasted red peppers because I did not have green onions or sesame seeds.  Everyone loved it...husband and kids included.

This was really good.  I made mine with whole wheat pasta and used a peppercorn medley for seasoning.  Also just used the purple onions that I had in my fridge.  No sesame seeds.  Added garlic powder, too.  I found that the wheat noodles really complimented this dish.  My boyfriend really liked it.  It's a keeper because it was so easy, hearty, and healthy to boot.

I loved this but it didn't go down well with the kids.  I left out the seeds and added garlic.

Oh, so good!  I sauteed some garlic and onion in the sauce pan before adding the tomatoes and lentils.  I am guessing some green peppers would also be yummy.  I doubled the amount of lentils, making a thicker "meatier" sauce.  I also added some Italian seasoning when adding the sesame seeds.  Parmesean cheese flakes on the top gave this a special touch.  This is a recipe that's easy and could easily be varied depending what you like and what you have on hand.

Made this dish when visiting my sons family, my daughter in law is vegetarian.  We all LOVED it ( and I am a die hard meat eater!)  Doubled the lentils and next time might  add even more ..  Proportion of veggies to spaghetti was perfect. I would also like to add toasted pine nuts instead of sesame seeds and maybe some halved large black olives.  This is definitely a recipe you can play with and customize to your tastes, but I do recommend making it close to the original for a starting frame of reference for the flavors.

I was super excited and optimistic about this recipe even though I typically don't eat lentils. I took one suggestion and doubled the amount of lentils so I used half a cup because I wanted to make it heartier.  and of course I added more liquid but I kept having to add more and more and more liquid away more than even the bag of lentils called for. The lentils took over an hour to cook which I was not prepared for. I did add about 5 cloves of garlic and round of those a little bit with the oil before adding the first ingredient. I also had to Salt it pretty good and I don't ever salt my food. So long story short this recipe was lacking a lot of flavor. I had to add some salt and the lentils were still partially hard even after cooking in a little over an hour. if you try this recipe I hope you will have a lot better luck than I did.

First review but had to say beyond easy and simply wonderful ! The only thing I changed is using a yellow onion instead on the green ones.

Followed the recipe - loved it!  My husband isn't thrilled when I cook vegetarian meals and he said this was a keeper!  Will definitely put in the rotation.  I'll add a little more heat next time just b/c we like things spicy, but that's the only change.  Was just as good the next day for leftovers b/c the flavors had time to blend.

This was delicious and healthy. The only changes I made were using whole wheat spaghetti and less cayenne, since I don't like things too spicy.

This is a very quick and easy meal - vegetarian answer to spaghetti and meatballs! I made it this evening with quartered brussel sprouts thrown in to the lentils instead of artichoke hearts, doubled the recipe, used whole wheat fettucini, regular onion instead of green, red lentils, and added Oregano and Thyme as well as the cayenne pepper. It worked well, but the sprouts likely need to be simmered a bit longer than the artichoke hearts. Enjoyed it with salad greens on the side!

I was a huge fan of this recipe! I started an almost fully vegetarian diet today so I was looking for something tasty to kick-start it, and this definitely did it! If I made it again I would probably add more lentils though since I love them. Also I substituted veggie fettuccine noodles and white onions which were excellent in it. I like that it was spicy but not overpowering and the canned artichokes gave it a great taste.

I guess I should add myself to the list of pleasantly surprised reviewers.  I expected this dish to be bland, and also discovered too late that I didn't have the lentils and had to make it without them.  I can't wait to make it again with the lentils.  Season to taste.  This was very tasty with just the right kick.
