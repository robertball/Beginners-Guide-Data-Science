Personally, this is one of my most favorite - eaten tartare. While I know raw meat can be dangerous, if you have the stomache, this dish is wonderful!! Raw or cooked.

My Lebanese grandma taught me how to make the classic fried football shaped kibbeh, and while delicious, they were time consuming! This is so much easier and tastes just as delicious. I made a yogurt mint sauce to go with them. Yum!!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! This was the most moist kibbee my family has ever had! I ended up baking it for 32 minutes.  All the flavors were there.  My only suggestion is that it needs more salt to bring all those wonderful flavors out.  I served this with plain non-fat yogurt and pita. Super easy to prepare.  My husband is ecstatic that he'll no longer have to wait to eat this dish at his parents' house now that I can make it!

This was the perfect recipe to get me started making a Lebanese meal.  Our favorite restaurant when we lived in Arlington, VA was the Lebanese Taverna.  I followed the recipe exactly but did form the meat into small(2-3 in.)football shaped pieces.  I browned them all over in a hot cast-iron skillet, then let them cook a little longer(15-20 min.)on medium.  I also made the garlic sauce recipe on this sight to serve for dipping with the kibbee as an appetizer.  Yum!

Made these for a BBQ and they were a big hit. Served them with tabouleh salad and mint and yoghurt dressing, in pita bread pockets.  Excellent.

Delicious combination of spices.  I only had ground sirloin in the house so I substituted this for the lamb.  YUM.  I also served with yogurt and a traditonal tabouli salad.

This was really quick, simple, and really very good. I actually grilled the kabobs rather than bake them and they were wonderful. I followed the ingredient list with the exception of adding garlic. I formed the meat on flat skewers and rested in the refrigerator to set up. I served with a green salad using Laura’s Lebanese Lemon Salad Dressing and Calebdgreen’s Lebanese Garlic Sauce. Wonderful, thank you all!

My family liked these, but they were a lot of work. Not good for my busy life.

I liked the flavor. Rest of the family was not impressed. Texture not great. I think these would be better as a meatball- maybe fried. Ended up using it for spaghetti.

I made kibbee for years for my family using a recipe like this.  In a hurry once I cheated using a box of tabouli mix: 1 box prepared with the hot water, 1 lb. ground lamb, a little dried onions and a generous shake of dried mint.  Boom...kibbee.

I have been searching and searching for an authentic recipe for Kibbee, I am so happy to have found one that tastes like I remember. So obviously, I will be making this again. The only thing I changed was to increase the pine nuts to three tablespoons, instead of two, because I am crazy for pine nuts. I can hardly wait to make it again, and this one is going to be made many, many times over the summer. Thanks, Mike!

Needs more salt and I added garlic. I halved the recipe for two and all other proportions were great.

We thought this had perfect flavors.  I forgot to buy bulgar so I used quinoa instead.  I thought I had pine nuts but realized I was out of them.  For tonight's dinner I mixed 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of lamb.  It turned out great!
