My husband and I did not like these at all.  We felt the Buffalo flavors are best suited with chicken - not beef.

This is wonderful and Atkins friendly. The blue
cheese doesn't melt away.

I used ground turkey meat instead I felt the flavors would meld better. I had to add some bread crumbs to help hold it together. Instead of lettuce I lightly sauted some thinly sliced celery and put it on top. It gave the burgers a great crunch and extra flavor burst.

This was SO delicious! The burger mixture was a bit messy, but I put some breadcrumbs in to help hold it all together (I also used super spicy wing sauce so I didn't use a whole 1/2 cup) and we LOVED it. Just a little mayo, some tomato and lettuce and this was such a flavorful burger. We'll make often. Make sure you use a good strong blue cheese - delish!

Based on the previous reviews, I added some bread crumbs and a little mayo to this recipe as binders. Turned out well.

I give this 4 stars as I think the measurements are a bit off.  I ended up using about 3-4 Tbs of Texas Pete brand hot sauce and about 2Tbs Worcestershire sauce.  I wasn't real sure about it at first...but once we had a finished product it was delicious.  I cooked mine in a cast iron pan, would have been real dicey to have grilled them (as mine were about to fall apart).  Husband really liked them...will definitely keep playing with the amount of hot sauce and worcestershire to get the right mix.  Thanks for sharing!

Not bad. I didnt really have a problem with it falling apart. I have other variations on the burger that I prefer but I guess it is a personal thing. Overall the family thought it was good burger.

Pretty good burgers. Nothing really exceptional, I didn't have any problems keeping the burger together (if you did, I suspect you're either new to making hamburger patties or your blue cheese or onions were too coarsely chopped).

I used way less chicken wing sauce, and finished it with a slice of swiss ontop just before taking it off the grill! I also find that 180 degrees will give you an overdone hamburger. I'd pull them off at 160 and while you are adding your condiments, it will keep cooking inside.

Reduced Hot Sauce to 1 T and didn't add to patties before cooking.  They were spicy, Bill liked them.

These burgers were a tasteless mess.  I had to fry them in a skillet after they fell apart on the grill.  Maybe Wostershire would help...an egg??some bread crumbs??  Sorry.
