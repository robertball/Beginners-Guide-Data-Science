I served this as a cracker spread at a potluck so I skipped the rolling it in nuts steps.  The combination of apple butter, cheddar, and bacon caused quite a few odd looks but that all changed once they tasted it.  Sweet, sharp, creamy and smoky  flavors all came together in perfect balance on top of a cracker.

Pretty good. I doubled apple butter to bring out the flavor more.  Used 2 cups of cheddar.  Seemed like too much butter for pecans.  Next time, I will only use 1 tablespoon.
