I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter.  The texture was not heavy (or "rich") like I thought it would be, and actually turned out lighter than other recipes I made (from this site) the same day.  I was also not fond of the prominent egg flavor, and the bread was not as sweet as other banana bread recipes I've tried.  If you do opt to try this recipe, watch the baking time closely--  mine took no where near 90 minutes to bake.  The ingredient list made me think this would be a great bread, but it is not a recipe I will make again.

Don't confuse it with those fluffy banana breads you're used to.  This one has a nice, dense texture and slices and freezes well.  It doesn't need nuts, which is nice for a change.  I would make this one again.  It's perfect for a brunch buffet table, and the kids love it.  Tried it with a bit of cinnamon honey and salty butter.  That was really wonderful.

Oh wow!  What a change from the banana breads I'm used to.  I could never make toast with other banana breads, but this was so good for breaky with peanut butter.  I am taking this to all my pot lucks and gatherings!

Hooray!  This is the banana bread recipe I've been looking for.  Moist, with a good banana flavor, no nuts, and a great texture.  I tried toasting it, too, and it works really well.

This bread is really very very good. Totally YUMMY! In fact, I will probably call this my all time favorite banana bread! The texture is more fine than most quick breads. In fact, this has more of a light muffin quality about it. It also reminds me of pound cake. Light and refreshing. It makes this more of a spring bread than heavy fall or winter quick bread. Very pleasant indeed! I did do a couple things different. I used 5 eggs and 4 bananas. I'm trying to get rid of 2 bunches. I used cinnamon in place of nutmeg too. And I threw in  a handful of raisins. I would also recommend you watch the baking time. Check yours at 70 minutes to be sure. Mine was a little over baked at 80. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Way too egg-y bread.  The texture and taste were very disappointing.  I would not recommend this or make it again.

It sure is different.  I always hated those fluffy, dry loaves with lumps of nuts in hotel breakfast buffets.  This one isn't like that.  It's moist and really good.  I tried it with cream cheese like the person who posted it said.  That was great.

I accidentally overbaked this bread, so although I thought it was quite good and everyone liked it, I'm going to have to make it again to give it a good trial.  I think perhaps it has one egg too many.

I am not much of a baker but this recipe makes me want to try more baking.  The bread turned out great and a good snack for my 20 month old.  I might add a little white sugar next time.  I like sweet things.

This is by far my favorite banana bread recipe.  I bake this in a 13x9 cake pan and top with banana frosting. (Cream cheese or vanilla frosting with a banana whipped into it with a mixer.) yummy!

I have made this banana bread several times - it's become my recipe of choice!  Based on the other comments about it tasting too eggy, I tend to use 4 eggs instead of 6.  I also use a pinch each of ginger, cinnamon and cloves instead of allspice, and throw in a teaspoon of maple syrup.  Also, I use bananas that are on the fermented-overripe-almost gone bad side. It comes out deliciously sweet and buttery - stands up to toasting really well.

I don't get the reviews complaining that this is rich.  It says so right in the recipe title.  It's RICH.  What did you expect?  And it does make great toast.

I made this recipe as muffins because the batter was way too much to make a loaf.  They turned out wonderfully after about 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I  had a similar recipe long ago and lost it  so I was very happy to find this here.  I have had plenty of people ask for this recipe and ask what makes a banana bread so nice and moist, with a slightly different flavor, but still so banana-y.

I enjoyed this being different from traditional banana bread - very filling and not so sweet.  4 stars overall but 5 when toasted - delicious!  Great with butter or peanut butter (or cream cheese frosting)

This is a good starting receipe. If you like to doctor things up then, start with this. I didn't measure my banana, I just used 3 and then some peanut butter and cinnamon. I think it could use some vanilla or almond extract. I might even try a little brown sugar next time. All in all the receipe is a good starter, and very easy to make your own. I would never make this bread to the written receipe though, I think it would be a bit bland.

This is a nice basic banana bread, with a little richer taste. I followed the recipe exact. This made two loaves that
were a bit on the small side.

Very good banana bread  used 5 eggs 1 cup brown 1 cup white sugar, pecans, choc, 1 extra banana  and a bit of cinnamon.  I made this a bunch of times now.  Only thing I do differently now is use a milk chocolate -almond bar and with a paring knife, cut it up both in the batter and then on top of the loaf. (omitting the pecans) WATCH THE COOKING TIME LIKE A HAWK THOUGH.

My best bread yet,  and not a crumb was left! It was even enjoyed by a family member who never liked  the taste of banana bread. I always add my own twist to recipes and with this one I added 1/4 cup of toffee bits, 1/4 cup of toasted coconut, and  1/4 teaspoon of cardamon. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing. Mrs B.

Wow! Super moist and a toasty- banana bread taste I love it. Didn't have to cook as long and followed the process exact. It's different from my usual very basic ingredients for BB w/ all the eggs and adding the vanilla & mashed banana's last. I love baking BB and have tried many recipes but, this one is a winner for me. Agree w/ the cream cheese on top and when it cools, I will try toasting as some others did. Thank you MB:)

This is a great banana bread recipe.  I did add walnuts, but that was it!  I did not find it too eggy as some other reviewers. I did use applesauce and only a little oil/ butter. I made this for my 89 grandmother- my own Mama B, and didn't even have but one super ripe banana- it was great!

Good recipe.  Very dense, not the "cakey" recipes that I usually make.  90 minutes is WAAAAYYY too long.  Check at 60.  I did 70 minutes, and that was a little too long.

I liked the moist consistancy of this recipe but I agree with other posters that this recipe has one too many eggs.  I also cut the ammount of fat by 1/2 cup to give it a slightly lighter texture.  I will definitely make this one agian, but will most likely fidget with the quantities of some of the ingredients.

I really did not care for this at all.  It is a very firm bread and the egg flavor is overwhelming.  My kids do not care for this either.

I thought it was very tasty.  Not drastically different from other banana breads but a bit heavier.  It was very moist and had good flavor.  I will probably make it again but I wouldn't say it's the only banana bread recipe I'll use from now on because it uses so many eggs.  It's good though.
It did not take 90 minutes to bake. It was more like 60. And I turned down the oven to 325 part way through because it was getting so dark.

I only had 2 bananas and 1 1/4 c. butter.  I already had an apple pie in the oven at 400 degrees, so it baked at 400 for about 20 minutes and then I turned it down to 325 for the remaining hour.  I turned out really good.  I usually get frustrated b/c bread usually doesn't get done in the middle without the outside burning.  This came out almost perfect!

This bread doesn't taste bad, however I felt as though I was eating pure grease and clogging my arteries so much that I didn't enjoy it.  Sometimes the flavor is worth the "clogging artery" feeling, this one . . . not so much.  It is good banana bread, but not one your friends will beg you for the recipe.

I'm so sorry to provide a poor rating for this bread.  I love banana bread and have been looking for a "decadent" and "rich" banana bread.  This one doesn't live up to the claim.  I made it specifically to the recipe provided.  While I read the reviews I thought that with the ingredients listed it had to be a wonderful bread.  I now understand the "eggy" comment.  I agree.  I would also have added some while sugar.  Unfortunately my result was so poor I won't be making this again.  I hate to lose 6 eggs and a ton of butter.  I'll just keep looking for the holy grail of banana bread. :o)

I thought this recipe was very good - extremely moist!  I thought it had too much banana taste - next time I will use less bananas.

We didn't care for this recipe.  It was really dense and gummy with all those eggs.  The eggs also masked a lot of the banana flavor.  I was hopeful because we raise chickens and I'm always on the lookout for recipes that use up a lot of eggs, but this isn't one I'll make again.

This is now the only recipe I use. I did add one more banana. Watch the cook time. I turn the heat down slightly toward the end and add a few minutes watching carefully. Check doneness with a knife in the middle coming out clean. I like a piece warm from the oven but it's better the next day after it sits. I also make muffins using this recipe.

This was not dense at all. Followed it to the letter. Took maybe 50 minutes to bake and it still burnt. Had I left it in the full 90 minutes I would have had bricks that had no banana flavor. A total waste of a dozen eggs seeing as I made a double batch. Will need to try a different recipe that calls for alot more bananas and add nutmeg and allspice. That part was good.

pretty good. Agree with a user above about 5 eggs instead of 6. I also upped the banana's and chose to cut down a bit of the butter, and add a bit of cinnamon too. Def. only 60-70 minutes, even at 70 minutes my crust was a bit crunchier than I prefer, but that could be my oven or pan I used as well. I think next time I will also add some chocolate chips for fun! Overall pretty good! I will make again and continue to tweek for my family's personal preference!
