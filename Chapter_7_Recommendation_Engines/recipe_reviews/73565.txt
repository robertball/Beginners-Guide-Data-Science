This was the first proscuitto and asparagus recipe I ever made, and I can't say we were terribly impressed with my first attempt. The prosciutto I buy is quite thin but rather large, and I soon discovered that there was WAY too much proscuitto for each spear - it was way too salty, it overwhelmed the taste of the asparagus, and it took so long to crisp up that the asparagus got soggy. We much prefer it when I just use a very thin ribbon of proscuitto per spear, or better still, use the 'Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus' recipe on this site, which uses a thicker ribbon of proscuitto and a little blob of cream cheese per bundle of spears.(For 5 stars, simmer the spears in boiling salted water 'til they turn bright green, immerse in iced water, then proceed with the recipe. It will stay beautifully crisp and green)

I wrapped my asparagus spears in posciutto that was smeared with cream cheese. I baked the goodies in an oven at 450 for 10 minutes and served. I wrapped the prosciutto and cream cheese around a few asparagus spears (2 or 3). It was outstanding.

I made these for a housewarming party and all the guests raved!  I did add a small dollop of cream cheese to the prosciutto as I wrapped,and this held everything together nicely.  I also only used half a piece and it was plenty. Yum Yum!

This was the first time I've attempted making these appetizers...and alas, I did find them a bit on the salty side, BUT...we still ate everyone of them.  I used a whole slice of prosciutto...I read where only using half would could down on the satiness.  Might go that route next time.  My asparagus was rather thin in diameter..so that could be another reason.  The last few minutes, I popped them under the broiler...just to make sure they were crispy.  Almost went with Taylor's suggestion to add Parm....but dedcided against it at the last minute!  We enjoyed these and thankx for sharing your recipe.

Instead of serving this as an appetizer, I served this as a side dish for Easter dinner.  Went wonderful with the ham and other spring vegetables and I was able to prepare it the night before, making it one less thing for me to rush to do before dinner.  My only changes was grating fresh Parmesan cheese and fresh cracked pepper over the bundles before serving.

This is a wonderful appetizer, partly because it's so easy to do.  I always use 1/2 slice prosciutto to cut salt and cost, and it's never been a problem.  We also frequently grill them AND shave fresh parm over warm spears.  The cheese puts this yummy clear over the top!

Very easy!  I found that to make the prosciutto crispy, it overbakes the asparagus, so don't worry about making it crispy.  Still tastes great!  Thanks for the recipe!

We wrapped some of the asparaus in prociutto, some in very thin sliced black forest ham, and some in thin sliced bacon. It was all amazing!

Delicious!!  Super easy and really tasty.  The asparagus is crisy and the prosciutto adds just the right amount of salt AND it's a good way to use up leftover prosciutto!

Note to those counting Weight Watcher points, each roll is only one point!

Made this for hubby....not for me (don't like it).  He really liked this.  I added some whole garlic cloves to the olive oil and added some parmesan cheese after it was done baking.  He asked me to keep the recipe on file.  Thanks for the post.

A few reminders--the prosciutto must be paper thin (have your Italian deli slice the (Parma brand) prosciutto rather than buying pre-sliced) and do not over cook the asparagus!  The only issue with these appetizers are that they must be eaten immediately.  If they sit out for more than 10 minutes they get mushy and soggy.  Martha Stewart has the best twist for them.  Blanch asparagus first and then roll asparagus, prosciutto, and parm in filo dough then bake them.  The filo dough gets crunchy, they last longer and they melt in your mouth.

4 stars, only because the recipe calls for each spear to be wrapped. Although this is best grilled, as others have mentioned, it can be delicious roasted as well. I simply finish it off under the broiler for a crisp finish to the meat. However, I've never, ever just wrapped one spear in prosciutto. For one thing - that's expensive! But more to the point, the meat 'is' very salty, so we bundle anywhere from 3 to 5 spears and just lightly drizzle with evoo. For a change, a little balsamic, a squeeze of lemon or a little zest is excellent as well. I wonder if the author prefers the thick stemmed asparagus, which might make a little difference. I only use the thin, tender ones. Also, more than not, I serve these at room temperature as an app. - so I'm perplexed as to the instruction to "serve immediately", which isn't a bad thing - but it's not the only alternative. My young neice & nephew will only eat this veggie at my house and they have never had them served hot, so don't be intimidated by time management with this one. DO TRY this recipe! It IS soooo good!

I've heard so much about the recipe, I had to try it. So glad I did because it was fantastic! I rolled the asparagus in some olive oil then wrapped it in the prosciutto, topped it off with some fresh parm cheese and baked on 375 for about 20 minutes. AMAZING!

This was so tasty! Even the non-asparagus lovers at our party loved this. Wrapping the spears with the thin meat took a bit of practice, but even the ones that didn't look good still tasted great. I used half a slice of prosciutto per spear and baked 7 minutes per side. Next time, I'd skip the oil. The prosciutto creats plenty of grease as it cooks.

These were super yummy. I tossed the aparagus in the evoo and garlic powder then I wrapped 4-5 spears in each slice of prosciutto, as "serving buddles". Mostly, because I didn't have enough to do each spear and was making as a side rather than an appetizer, but it worked really well. Still had a very nice flavor without getting too salty. New favorite asparagus recipe! Thanks

I've made this recipe quite a few times, but I spread the prosciutto with a flavored goat cheese first and drizzle on truffle oil after baking.  Many, many compliments.

I grilled these rather than baked and they went GREAT with our steak and baked potatoes!  My boyfriend and dad were DYING over them.  I made the following changes:  Poured some olive oil and fresh cracked salt and pepper over one bunch of asparagus and two bunches of green onions.  Rolled around to coat.  Then, for each bundle, I took two pieces of asparagus and one piece of green onion, folded the prosciutto in half (lengthwise) and wrapped around the center of the bundles.  Secured with a toothpick and grilled until done.  I'm telling you, this was AMAZING.

I made these for friends who dropped by the other night, and I've been asked to make them again for our next get together, which is a very good sign!  I did blanch my asparagus for about 2 minutes.  I used 1/2 a slice of proscuitto per spear- the whole slice would have overwhelmed the nice thin stalks I had.  I spread a little herbed alouette cheese on the inside of each proscuitto slice as others had suggested.  I'm not sure if it added tons of flavor, but it definitely held them together nicely.  A little spritz of olive oil spray on the tray and on tops of the spears were all they needed to keep them from sticking and to allow them to crisp up nicely.  Definitely a winner in my book- quick and easy, but impressive looking.  You can even make them earlier in the day and just bake them when you''re ready.  I think they'll make a great addition to my holiday appetizer buffet.

Wonderful stuff.  I tried this with the prosciutto and some thin sliced bacon and definitely preferred the prosciutto.  The bacon did not get crisp enough by the time the asparagus was cocoked.  It cooks fast.  This was great and I will make it again for sure.  Thanks for sharing Thaider.

I like this as written, no cream cheese addition. That way the prosciutto gets nice and crisp and the flavors are very bright.

Fabulous! I coated the asparagus w/ a bit of Columela EVOO (I could drink that stuff!) & then wrapped them w/ half a slice of prosciutto. I garnished w/ fresh grated parmesan & served them alongside pesto bruschetta as an appetizer. We enjoyed it so much that tonight's dinner, will be last night's appetizers. ;o) We had a marvelous menu planned & all we wanted to do was eat the appies. LOL Great recipe...thanks THAIDER!

This was a HUGE hit for the New Year's Eve party I attended!  These changes made this appetizer a 5-star recipe (or else it would have been a 2-3 star recipe!)   DEFINITELY take the advice of many others: smear on a generous layer of cream cheese to each slice of prosciutto.  Make sure the prosciutto slices are very thin.  Also - bake for only about 4 minutes total!  No parmesan cheese necessary (like other reviewers recommended).  It is way too salty with the parmesan cheese.  A tasty, unique app!  Keep in mind though...both asparagus and prosciutto can be quite pricey.

Delicious, easy and fun to make and elegant as an appetizer. At least one guest at every event where we've served this has asked for the recipe and then made it for their special occasions.

I served these at a cocktail party with my Italian friends and everyone loved them.  It was the easiest thing I made that night and by far the fav.  I sprinkled some fresh lemon zest over them before broiling.

I had these at a very expensive restaurant in Calgary and have been dreaming of these ever since.  These are absolutely fabulous!  I rated a **** because I did these on a lightly oiled barbeque instead of in the oven.  I turned them as the prosciutto got carmelized and crisp.  If you parboil the asparagus it will be overcooked!!  To cut the salt a bit and add extra flavor, throw a half a lemon on the grill to char a bit.  Squeeze it over the spears before you serve it (that's how they did it in the restaurant) and you won't be disappointed!!

Nice, easy appetizer!  I love the simplicity and the flavor was very good.  I had some extra asparagus spears and threw them on the pan with the wrapped ones and they were good too!

The only thing I did differently was let them sit in olive oil and black pepper for 15 minutes before I wrapped them. Delicious! They disappeared in minutes!

This is one of the most perfect appetizers!! I'm getting married this summer and just had all of my bridesmaids together last weekend. This was one of the appetizers and it was a huge hit! I did tweak the recipe a bit. I smeared about a half of a teaspoon of herb and garlic creamcheese on to the procuitto and then wrapped the asparagus! Then followed the baking instructions and this recipe is fabulous! Thank you!

Made this as a side dish on the grill with some cedar plank lemon pepper salmon.  oiled the grill plate, and added some sea salt and cracked black pepper to the asparagus. The prosciutto crisped up easily on the grill and the asparagus didn't get mushy. Pretty presentation.

Excellent! I used 1/2 piece of proscuitto per spear, and they were perfect. Put a little cracked pepper on them before baking. They were a hit at our Christmas brunch, I will be making these for a baby shower next month! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I liked the photo that another reviewer submitted with 3 spears bundled together. I might try that next time, as the prosciutto was a little too salty for the tiny spears I had.

VERY GOOD! Instead of only wrapping one spear, I wrapped 3 to 4 and after the first five minutes of cooking I add the five italian cheese mix found in the shredded cheese section then cook it for the rest of the time! It is PERFECT!

Really easy and tasty.  Not sure why people are complaining about the amount of salt- I used thin sliced prosciutto from my butcher, so maybe it has to do with the quality of their meat.  I did grind some fresh pepper over the top before roasting.

This was good, but be careful how much olive oil you use! It takes the prosciutto forever to cook, and then once it finally gets crisp, your asparagus is almost overdone and your oven is smoky! Just a warning. :)

This is a fantastic recipe!!  It's so simple, and yet the resulting taste is surprisingly sophisticated.  I could only find rather large asparagus, so I cut them in half and rubbed both sides with a halved clove of garlic.  I didn't oil the bottom of the pan and the flavours from the proscutto really had a chance to mingle with the asparagus.  Mmm!  A wonderful blend of textures and flavours!!  This is a recipe to save and serve at my next dinner party!

This is a quick and elegant appetizer. I would definitely recommend spreading a soft cheese over the prosciutto first, and sprinkling some freshly ground pepper over the pieces before baking.

I made these for Christmas Eve as one of many appetizers.  They were incredible!  So delicious and looked somewhat fancy.  Surprisingly, they did not take very long to prepare.  I made over 60 of them and I only used a half of a slice of prosciutto and spread the prosciutto with onion and chive cream cheese (lightly).  Delicious...will make them often for get togethers.

I followed the advise of someone else and applied a light coating of olive oil with my fingers to each asparagus stalk before wrapping with half a slice of prosciutto.  Too much prosciutto makes this too salty.  The oo makes the prosciutto stick.  Bake in 375 for 20 minutes shaking once to rotate midway through cooking.  This was great!! Garner with a little shaving of parmesan but not too much because of saltiness. thanks!!

I did steam them for a short time before throwing them in the oven!

I made this for a small gathering the other night and most of my guests really loved them! Normally I really enjoy prosciutto but there was something about this combo that made it seem so extra salty. I felt like the asparagus was a little overpowered and it made the dish a little one dimensional.

Great idea, but it just didn't work for me or my husband!  Way too salty even though I cut down on the prosciutto and added the cream cheese.  Maybe my prosciutto is to blame (?).  I'm not picky; I love the idea, and I'm not done with this concept yet!

I listened to previou reviews and cut each piece of prosciutto in half.  I dipped the prosciutto in a mixture that contained olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped onions.  I baked for 5 minutes, flipped them, baked for 3 minutes, shaved fresh parmesaen on top and baked another 2 minutes, for a total baking time of 10 minutes. DELICIOUS!  I served as a side along with garlic potatoes and steak.

This is a delightful side dish or appetizer.  It was easier to make and cooked better when I tore the proscuitto in strips then wrapped the asparagus.  Even the four-year-olds love their veggies with this recipe.

I just made and ate these and loved them! I used a bit of cream cheese and cut my proscuitto slices into thirds and found it to be the perfect amount for a nice spiral without too much saltiness. No seasoning required with all the flavor of the proscuitto.

Pretty good, but kind of on the salty side.  I squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top just before serving to subside the salty flavor and that seemed to help.  Will probably make again.

Having just experienced the exquisite dates-plus-prosciutto combo, I thought anything plus prosciutto would be excellent. Unfortunately, asparagus is better left alone.

I cook this side/app probably at least once a week, except if you love goat cheese as much as I do make sure to spread goat cheese on the prosciutto before wrapping it around the asparagus! Also it helps to blanch the asparagus before putting it on the grill which I highly recommend over baking it

This recipe was fabulous and SO delicious.  Definately not something you see everyday - yet so simple to make.  I did follow the previous suggestion of only using 1/2 a slice of prosciutto for each spear, which was perfect.  I'll definately be making these again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  I did spread some chive cream cheese on the proscuitto before wrapping it around the asparagus, and then baked for about 20 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious!  I'm going to make these again for a company Christmas party, but since proscuitto is so expensive, I'm going to try bacon this time and will probably cook the bacon quite a bit first.  Great recipe!!

Overall these were pretty tasty.  But with cooking the asparagus with the prosciutto on them makes them a little too salty.  I prefer roasting the asparagus first with a little olive oil and wrapping them in a paper thin piece of prosciutto after they are cooked and serving them at room temp. is much better and less salty. Thanks for the recipe.  It was a good idea to go from.

I made this for a family get together, and personally I didn't care for it.  My brother-on-law and his wife loved them.  Its just a personal preference for me, I've never cared for asparagus, and I was hoping this would be a recipe that would change my mind.

This was so good-something about the salty prosciutto makes it wonderful. The only thing that I did was to grill the asparagus for a few minutes and then wrap the proscittuo around it and put it back on the grill to make it crispy- yummy!

I loved these! They make a great complement to all the creamy and cheesey dips that we usually serve at parties. 1/2 a slice of prosciutto is definitely enough for each spear--and more cost-efficient. It's a little time consuming to clean and wrap the spears but a good job for a young helper.

This is awesome for a quick, classy appetizer.  I usually half the slice of proscuitto, cuts cost and salt and it still tastes great.  Actually I think it is better.  If I have time I spread a little plain or flavored lower fat cream cheese on asparagus.  I like it best this way.  A Real Keeper.

This was one side dish served with our Easter ham this year.  The only change I made to the recipe was to spread a layer of cream cheese on the proscuitto before I rolled it up.  The cheese got all melted and gooey after being in the 450 degree oven for 15 minutes.  And you absolutely can do everything the night before and serve them at room temperature the next day if you were running short on time.  Fabulous!

I made this for a party and it was gone in a flash.  Although I'm sure it would be absolutely delicious just the way it's written, I did blanch the asparagus first and then spread a very thin amount of cream cheese on the prosciutto slice before rolling up.  This made roll-up easier and also added a bit more taste.  Loved it the first time and am making again tonight!  Note:  Several people commented that they had had asparagus prosciutto roll-ups before, but never with the crispy prosciutto; I think that makes a big difference!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Excellent appetizer! Follow the recipe as is! These can be prepared ahead a time and just throw them in the over right before serving. These were a hit at my party and everyone enjoyed them. I will be making them again!

Anything that is easy to prepare and equally delicious gets 5 stars from me. I baked mine for 10 mins each side at 450. The proscuitto was crisp and the asparagus well done. Sprinkled lots of black pepper and parmesan on top and it wasn't very salty. Fully recommend this recipe!

The recipe is OK, needs some tweaking... I had a different recipe and looked this one one up mainly to retrieve info on cooking time. The main thing is to prep the asparagus right -- wrap them in 1-2 slices of prosciutto (we used 2 for each pair of asparagi but one can wrap 3, 4 or 5 at the time depending on how much prosciutto you got). No oil in the pan, and no rolling mid way through. Just place the asparagus wraps on parchment paper, dot each bundle with a small amount of low-fat butter atop, then sprinkle grated Parmigiano cheese along the length of the bunch, then sprinkle further with paprika. Bake at 450 (but 425-430 is OK too) for 10 min without moving the asparagus prosciutto bundles and serve as is. Had it as a side dish to a NY strip steak -- excellent!

This is wonderful. I make it as a side with baked salmon and my boyfriend doesn't know which tastes better. Regardless, the dinner ends with a clean plate and a happy man. I use super thin asparagus and proscuitto, make sure to only use enough to cover, approximately a third of a strip.

Sooo easy to make and sooo delicious.  I served them at a party last night and everyone went crazy over them!  I used half a piece of prosciutto for each asparagus which was perfect, and actually cooking them for 10 minutes did leave them a tad crispy, which was great!

Great recipe, but I took the advice of others and used only 1/2 slice of proscuito per spear.  It would have been too salty otherwise.

I thought these were pretty good when I brought the wraps to a Thanksgiving potluck. But couple days ago a friend from the dinner party told me that she has made this dish more than once for other dinner parties since mine. THATS a great compliment for this recipe.

I made this with some cream cheese.
We couldn't leave it alone.
All I can say is "This is the best"

Such a simple concept but SO amazingly yummy!  Perhaps more than any other recipe I've ever gotten from this site, I couldn't believe the response from my guests.  They went like hotcakes.  My boyfriend, who would typically RUN from asparagus, actually came back for 2nds & 3rds & .. asked when I'm making them again!

Salty, yes, but this is pretty darn appealing. Cut the prosciutto into thirds.

The prosciutto was very salty.  I didn't not like this at all.  We unwrapped the asparagus and ate it.  I thought it was a waste of money because the prosciutto was not cheap.

These were so good!  Added a sprinkling of grated parmeasan cheese right before serving which added a very nice flavor.  Bet you can't eat just one!! :)

Fabulous! Made this for a New Year's Eve party and it disappeared very quickly. Everyone loved it. Very simple and easy to prepare ahead. I wrapped the asparagus ahead of time and only had to pop it in the oven at the last minute to get it ready to serve. I think it would be worth trying this recipe with a less expensive meat (prosciutto was $12 a pound when I bought it) - maybe a thin sliced bacon or shaved ham would give the same elegant presentation and still taste great? Wonderful as it is, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Everyone who tried this wanted the recipe. We served this to a party of 12. We made enough for everyone to have 2 spears and could have used more. These were outstanding and very easy.
Thanks for sharing.

I made this and took it to the potluck at our neighborhood pub and they all disappeared within minutes. My wife and I each had one and enjoyed them but kind of wished there had been some leftovers. 
The one major change I made is that I first microwaved the asparagus in a closed container for just one minute (something like parboiling in the old days :) ) and then wrapped the spears three at a time in the prosciutto and grilled them on an indoor stovetop griddle, rather than roasting them in a oven. See the photo under "Avery" for reference.

SO GOOD!! I made these for a Christmas gathering, and boy I tell you what, these disappeared very quick.
I split one slice of prosciutto length wise and spread a thin layer of cream cheese over it, then spiraled around 3 thin asparagus. Cook at recommended temperature for 3 minutes, shake the pan and put back in the oven an additional 2 minutes. Broil for an additional 2 minutes for added crisp.
There's plenty of salt from the ham, so I don't recommend adding salt or parmesan as others have mentioned. Will be making this for every special occasion. Thinking of wrapping my scallops with this ham as well :)

Purely delicious and simple to make.  
I blanched the asparagus. Then wrapped about 4-5 of them in prosciutto.   Sprayed foil with olive oil Pam and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese. Baked for 10 mins, turning them halfway. It was a hit. Guests from my dinner party were impressed and asked for the recipe.  Definitely would make again. Thanks for sharing.

I have made these for years and they are always a hit. I usually wrap mine with either fresh grated parmasean cheese or my favorite blue cheese or a combo of both. I also spray mine with spray olive oil and Grill them. They are awesome

This is good! Then I tried this -
Make it killer by spreading softened cream cheese on the prosciutto before wrapping the asparagus, it tears easy, be careful. Don't bake it, grill it.
You'll be glad you did.

Always a hit and so easy!  I slice the prosciutto in half, lengthwise, otherwise it is too much prosciutto for each spear.

This is even better than what I thought it would be. I sliced the proscuitto length wise in 4ths since its over $12 a pound. This is well worth the price.

Incredible!  They were a huge hit at an informal family dinner!  Just be warned that prosciutto can be difficult to handle and a little time consuming.  My spears were a little thicker that I'd normally use so I added about 2 mins. to the cooking time.

DELICIOUS!  I made these and several other appetizers for a card game this past Saturday night, and the asparagus wrapped in prosciutto went in minutes!  I should have doubled the recipe.  Everybody raved over this!

These are great exactly as this recipe is, but I've also marinated the asparagus in Asian ginger dressing for a couple hours before wrapping and baking them.  Also good!

These were good but I did make some adjustments as I had something similar before. As others suggested, I used only half a piece of prosciutto.  I also added cream cheese seasoned with some garlic powder.  I made them as an appetizer for a dinner party and people enjoyed them but didn't go crazy over them.  I would make them again and I wouldn't change the adjustments I made.

I love this recipe. It is very elegant and beautiful, not to mention wonderful tasting. I did not cut the ham in half but next time will definately do so. Big money saver and won't notice a difference. This recipe is a keeper.

I made the recipe as written and also with the suggested addition of a little cream cheese spread on the prosciutto. The original recipe was just missing something, and the altered was perfect so 3 stars for the original and I highly recommend a little cream cheese.

I actually had my kids make it - they wanted something fun but easy to contribute for dinner so we searched and found this recipe. It was great, easy to follow directions and healthy (kids and their friends didn't care). We ended up making it three times because everyone was eating them all up! Thanks for this.

So easy and do delicious!   This healthy & Keto  friendly dish is awesome with the prosciutto it as such a great flavor to the asparagus I put mine under the broiler for about an additional two minutes to get that chard  & crispiness of the prosciutto.

Oops I hit enter by mistake on a previous review. This is the fourth time I have made this recipe and I would not change it one bit except for haps a little bit of ground black pepper. There’s no need to par boil the asparagus it cooks fine per the instructions. I tried the Parma di prosciutto from Costco as well as their bulk asparagus and that worked great. I actually cut the prosciutto lengthwise in half with a pair of kitchen scissors. They are packaged on small wax papers so this was very easy to do and it made more even slices. It was actually very good quality and much easier to work with than that from my butcher. Also keep in mind that you don’t need that much prosciutto to wrap these, and if you keep the asparagus at an angle you can wrap it with a very thin slice and the prosciutto does not overpower the asparagus.

We wrapped the asparagus all the way from bottom to top and it came out delicious. The prosciutto was semi-crispy and the asparagus was still firm and not overdone.  The next time we make it, we might try it with a cream cheese mixture of some sort.

This is a great recipe because it is so easy and delicious.  I made it for a side dish so I put 3-4 spears in half slice of prosciutto.  I did spread a little whipped cream on the prosciutto first.  Hubby liked it

This is one of my favorite appetizers to make for guests or just for myself as a snack.  I make it just as stated in the recipe.  I don't make a dip or anything else to serve with it... it does not need it in my opinion.    It is super easy to assemble and so tasty!  This dish also presents beautifully, and due to its unusual ingredients, give it a very unique flare ;)))

I am also on the Paleo diet and these ingredients suit it perfectly.  Paleo is also Gluten Free... so a win/win for a lot of folks out there ;)

A bit salty, but good, I wrapped each one and maybe should have done a few asparagus with each piece of meat.

I ended up buying a pound of asparagus (on the thinner side),  and spiraled half a slice of prosciutto up the length of each stalk (stopping short of the tips). A whole slice would have swallowed my thin spears and I was afraid they would be wrapped too thick to get crisp. I was still left with extra asparagus, so I roasted them on a separate pan just below the pan with prosciutto. I did roast 7 minutes on each side, and added an extra two minutes of broil for the prosciutto ones to crisp that up more (this may be due to the extra pan).  They were FANTASTIC. It's only been two days and I HAVE to make it again. I didn't realize until this recipe that I had previously been cooking my asparagus to death, and drowning them in olive oil. (That's why they were so limp and sad.) Really love this recipe.

Easy and delicious crowd pleaser!

As proscuitto is fragile, allow yourself focused prep time to carefully seperate each piece, and then wrap. I actually cut each slice of proscuitto in half (long way) and was able to make twice as much.

These are wonderful with thick asparagus. I used good olive oil. Sprinkled shaved parmesan after removing them from oven. Made once with prosciutto and once with shaved pastrami. Both were delicious !

I wrapped several asparagus stalks with a slice of proscuitto.   They were very good, although a bit salty.  I served at room temp. and got rave reviews.  I will make this again.

This was the easiest recipe ever, but I needed to lower the temperature to 400F since my oven heats really hot !   Olive oil only needed right under the asparagus, not all over the foil. Delicious every time !

I added lemon juice to the olive oil & rolled a little crumbled feta in. As with most cured meats it became a little salty when baked but was very well received at the table. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious and a big hit as part of our Christmas festivities. I baked the asparagus longer then recommended; 20-25 minutes to make sure the asparagus are cooked all the way through. Depends on the thickness of the asparagus; I had very thick ones.

Easy and elegant. I wouldn't describe the proscuitto as "crispy", but it's very flavorful. The salty meat pairs well with the vegetable. I suppose  the cooking time depends on the size of the asparagus; I reduced the time to 3 minutes before shaking the pan, followed by another 3 minutes @ 450-degrees.

Very simple elegance.  It was a little salty, but that was expected from the prosciutto.  If anything, the salt kept me from eating the entire batch.  Nice recipe that was added to my book.

So amazingly good!! And good leftover!  Would probably even be enjoyed by people who don't like asparagus.
