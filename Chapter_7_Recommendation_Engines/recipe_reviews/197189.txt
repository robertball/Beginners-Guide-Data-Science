Very good! I only cooked my sauce for about ten minutes because I like my veggies a little underdone, otherwise made as written. This is a great, easy, lighter alternative to lasagna or baked ziti. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing.  I added oregano.  My husband always wants to know where the meat is when I make something like this.  He said that he could eat this everyday and didn't even miss the meat.

This is AMAZING! I'm a vegetarian and I've made this for my non-vegetarian family members before, and they LOVED IT!!! Sometimes I use whole wheat penne, I usually omit the red onion or substitute Sweet Vidalia onion, I use diced tomatoes with green chilis in them to spice it up a bit (or sometimes I omit the tomatoes altogether), and I top it off with thinly sliced Munster cheese instead of shredded mozzarella. VERY GOOD!!! Sometimes I make a "meaty version" for my family, by adding either 1 pound cooked ground beef or 2 boiled and diced boneless skinless chicken breasts.

This was soooooo good. I am very pleased with the way it came out. I'm always looking for ways to use my zucchini as a main dish instead of a side. Only thing I did differently is left out the red peppers and corn(I didn't have any on hand) and added more onion. I also seasoned the veggies with adobe and seasoned salt.

Really good way to use up some of those garden vegetables. I used a can of rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes. Just a tad spicy. Next time I'll try just the regular. Good flavor, easy to make, easy to sub in other vegetables and spices too! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe with lots of variations possible.  We excluded the peppers, added some fresh sliced mushrooms and chopped kale.  I added 1up of low fat ricotta & 1/3 cup parmesan cheese to the mixture when blending it all together prior to baking.  You can reduce the mozzarella topping if you want a trade off.  What is particularly nice is that this freezes well.  We freeze leftovers in individual portion sizes with our Food Saver.  Just defrost & reheat in the microwave or a warm oven - it'll save you $$ on fast food alternatives for those nights you're too tired for kitchen wizardry.    This dish seems to just get better over time!

This is my new favorite recipe on here! DELISH! My yellow squash ended up being bad so I just doubled the zucchini & used stewed tomatoes for the canned tomatoes. Unbelievably good! I'm planning to make Italian meatloaf I to go w/this tonight but it stands out as a great main dish on it's own! It definately makes more than 6 servings-you can easily feed twice that many!Thank you chicklet!!

Very good and very easy. Reheats well in the microwave and even tastes better the second time around. A great way to use up those summer squashes.

Excellent way to get some veggies in my little brother's diet. I used whole wheat pasta and added more garlic and zucchini (didn't have yellow squash).  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

NICE RECIPE and VERY GOOD IDEA to use local vegies in season.Add corn cut from one nice size ear and a few fresh tomatoes also.I don't understand the canned corn or canned tomatoes called for when the idea is to use fresh seasonal vegies.Leave out the canned corn and canned tomatoes.FRESH CORN and Tomatoes are  AVAILABLE  AT SAME TIME THOSE OTHER VEGIES ARE AVAILABLE and FRESH LOCAL is best. I'm from Wisconsin and live in a farming area so I'm blessed with an abundance of farms all around and roadside stalls plus farmers markets daily in towns.If you have time I would advise to make a homemade sauce with all the cheap tomatoes near the begining of fall(tons at the markets after first frost).As far as the corn I would never use canned unless in a bomb shelter situation,frozen maybe! If you are really in a hurry use the chunky sauce called for , add a few fresh vegies of whatever is available and ENJOY!

Absolutely love this recipe. Made this while on Lent when my family gave up red meat. I was struggling trying to figure out what to cook, when I found this Jem of a recipe. Everything was perfect. These measurement make a lot of food so if its only two of you, you might want to half the recipe. Absolutely in love with this recipe. Thank you to the recipe poster.

The seasonings make for a nice, flavorful sauce. That said, the end result was more like baked sauce with pasta than the reverse. Next time, I plan to cut back on the pasta sauce by 1/3 to provide more balance and allow the flavors of both the pasta and cheese to come through.

Great recipe for end of season garden produce.  Used several tomatoes from the garden rather than jarred sauce.

I make this often -- didn't realize they had an actual recipe for it -- I don't use jar sauce -- Just a can of crushed tomatoes & a big handful of basil from the garden. ( I never tried corn either but sounds good -- a can of red beans works well.)

Delicious! I used whole wheat pasta and homemade pasta sauce, also left out the corn. LOVED IT! The bell pepper adds so much flavor. I do agree with the other revised about the serving size though.  It really should feed 10-12. Oh well, I was happy to have enough to free for a whole meal another day!

Looking for more recipes to use up squash from the garden brought me to this recipe.  Even my son, who isn't fond of squash, enjoyed this dish.  Delicious!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I make pasta similar to this quite frequently.  Use fresh vegis for the best flavor, for sure.  Tonight I used garlic, onion, grated zucchini and crookneck squash from our garden and added some store bought onion and garlic pasta sauce.  I also made this like a mock lasagne with elbow mac instead of penne and some ricotta mixed with an egg, some garlic, salt, pepper, parm and mozzerella cheeses, and chopped parsley.  I layered some sauce, the pasta (undercooked about 3 minutes), the ricotta mix, some chedder and mozzerella and topped with the rest of the sauce, some olives and more cheese.  It was awesome.  Grate the squashes and the picky kids who gag on it will eat and never know it was there.  This is a very customizable recipe, so make it with whatever you have and enjoy.  As long as the pasta is well undercooked, you can make the full giant recipe, but put half in a freezer container or foil pan and pull it out for another day.  The recipe's amount would feed my family of 4 for at least 3-4 meals, easily.  I normally scale it down to use 2 cups of dry pasta and it will do 2 very generous meals for us.

Tasty.  Like others said, makes a lot.  I opted to use a different shape pasta  - ziti (personal preference).  Kept the veggies the same.  I did notice it too a bit longer for my veggies to get cooked than the recipe states.  (no biggie)  I made the mistake of only buying one 14 oz of diced tomatoes so I had to work with that.  It definitely needed more like the recipe calls for.  Opps.  The veggies gave the recipe a bit of a sweet flavor in my opinion, which was not bad at all.  Nice dish.  Thank you chicklet!

Wow - much better than I expected.  First, by chop, it's meant about 1/2 inch cubes.  Try to be consistent there for even cooking.  I hit up the farmer's market this weekend and we were feeling like a "light" meal and I had the squash, zucchini, onion, and red and green peppers on hand...  And man were they FRESH (ever notice the stuff from your farmer's market is not as pretty but tastes so much better?)   You could taste the freshness.  I halved the recipe, and followed it exactly in that respect EXCEPT corn is very much in season here in Florida now so I just cut the kernels off 1 ear and used those (1 ear yields about 1/2 to 3/4 cups FYI).  Oh and I used whole wheat/high protein penne pasta (Barilla).  I'd say def. boil your pasta till just under done - like you would for a lasagna noodle (very aldente).  Either way, the recipe is awesome and you can just go any way from here (next time I'm adding eggplant).  We ate it up and still have leftovers for 4 more servings minimum!!  Wonderful and on my rotation.  You won't miss the meat - and we have a rule - 3 meals per week are meat-less. Thank you.

I also undercooked my veggies--we don't like soggy squash--and added polish sausage cut up with it.  Good eats.

This recipe is Boring! The squash and peppers don't add much to the flavor, and without stronger influences, like say broccoli or black olives, it just tastes like the canned spaghetti sauce.

This wasn't very tasty right out of the oven but because I had so much left, I refrigerated it overnight. Reheated the next day it earned a 5 star rating. Suggest  making the day before you want to serve it. I am making more now to have for tomorrow.

I added broccoli to this recipe just because I felt it should be added to the mix.  It was AWESOME!  And this from someone who usually doesn't do vegetarian recipes...definitely 5 stars!

Loved it and so did my family.  
Upgraded the tomatoes with in-season herilooms, the corn for fresh corn (canned?!?), fresh chopped mozarella and lots of fresh basil from the garden.  
Serves and army...

I loved this dish!  I only added olives and mushrooms because I love olives and mushrooms in Italian pasta type foods.  Oh, I used gluten free pasta.  The dish had just the right kick.

I was so skeptical about this "casserole" my family HATES casseroles. However, I have an abundance of garden produce right now and took a chance. It was fabulous. I used Barilla spicy marinara and pretty much followed the recipe exactly. Only adding some fresh cut basil, fresh corn and two large tomatoes instead of canned. I added some fresh parmesean to the mozzarella. Season the veggies with some garlic salt and cook them until they look a little golden. This made it excellent!!!!!! Even the family loved it! We loved the spiciness of the red pepper and marinara. ALSO a lot of people comment on the volume of this recipe use SMALL zucchini, HALVE the recipe and it makes enough for 8 as a SIDE dish.

I absolutely love this!  Great way to use up veggies.  I halved the recipe but left the cheese the same.  I used one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes (seasoned with garlic, basil and oregano).  Thanks for this easy recipe!

I cut this recipe in half and it still made a ton, enough to have easily filled a 9 x 13 pan.  It was good, but a little bland and needed something extra for flavor.   Kind of hard to rate this because the overall flavor is going to vary from one brand of pasta sauce to the next.

Very nice, even my husband was saying it was tasty.  I used butternut squash for the squash and left out the red pepper as I didn't have any.  Only thing different I did was to blend most of the sauce to a smooth consistency so my veg phobic 4yr old wouldn't turn up his nose.  In the end he ate a whole bowl full.  Nice way to use up garden veggies.  Will try again in a few months time when my youngest is ready for solids.

This is very good, but makes much more than what my 9x13 baking dish would hold.  The recipe says that it serves 6, but I think it would serve 10-12.

This is a very hearty meatless dinner. I added two carrots sliced and used yellow onion instead of red. I only used half a package of small shell pasta and half each of a large zucchini and yellow squash, half a can of corn and a 26 oz jar of pasta sauce, I left out the can of diced tomatoes and the crushed red pepper flakes. I scaled it down so there wouldn't be too many leftovers. Turned out great and my boyfried really liked this!

Fabulous. Made this as follows: 1 squash, 1 zucchini, 1 green pepper, 7 green onions, 1-2 T minced garlic. Used one 16 oz pkg of penne, 1/2 can drained corn niblets, 1 14.5 oz. can crushed tomatoes and 1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes. Left out the crushed red peppers, as the 2yr old wouldn'have liked it. topped with layer of extra thick slices of fresh mozzarella cheese. Convection baked for 25 min. at 350. Awesome.

This was easy, delecious and healthy.  Loved it!  I added some Italian meatballs, though, as my hubby likes some meat in his meal, and that was a good compliment.  I also used the Italian seasoned tomatoes.

Yummy and very simple.  The corn really makes it a unique dish.  The serving size is deceiving, though.  I cut the recipe in half and still had enough for at least 6 servings (and we're big eaters!).  Other than adding more garlic (per usual) I didn't vary from the recipe at all.  This is a keeper!

Awesome! I only had 1 zuc and 1 squash so I had to cut the recipe by half. Also, I used my own homemade pasta sauce. This would be a great freezable dish to use up the extra zucs, squash, and tomatoes from my garden. Can't wait to freeze them and have this dish in the winter.

I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this turned out to be, despite the fact that it's not chock full of cheese and uses so many veggies! I added some oregano and left out the corn, but otherwise made it according to the recipe. My husband and I both agreed that the crushed red pepper was not optional--it needed that zing.

Followed the recipe exactly except more garlic - about double (can't have enough :), and shredded zucchini and squash. Whole family loved it and my daughter finished it off before I could get my hands on it. There has been a request to have this again this week, especially since the zucchini and squash are at peek harvest. Plan to make another batch or two and freeze in zip lock bags.

Needed a Lenten dish to go with beef sandwiches for a party yesterday and this was delicious!  I didn't have penne so I used cavatapi pasta.  Wasn't sure about doing this but combined everything but the cheese and covered with foil and let sit for hour and a half before baking.  Will definitely make this again and try different veggies.  The entertaining stoneware large serving bowl from Pampered Chef was absolutely perfect to bake this in as well as gorgeous to to serve it in and being stoneware, stayed warm longer.

This was delicious! I wouldn't say it was bland, but it could have used a bit for flavor. I would probably try it with a more zesty pasta sauce next time (I used Frescorti Marinara). I would also try sprinkling cheese throughout the whole casserole, instead of just on top.

Sorry to have to say this but we did not care for this recipe..  Followed instructions exactly as written. First off it made way more than 6 servings  and actually filled up 2- 9 x 13 dishes which would have been okay for freezing if we enjoyed it. The pasta sauce just overpowered everything else and dominated our plates.

This lady must have one huge pan to cook this in!  lol
Only ingredient change was using Muenster instead of mozzarella because of personal choice.  After I had sauted everything for 10 min.,  I didn't think it needed to simmer for 20 min more because I thought it would be mushy.  So baked it after adding the rest of the ingredients and it turned out great.  Great recipe.

I actually made penne with meat sauce earlier in the week. Then applied this recipe with the leftovers.  It was a fantastic way to use up some of our garden veggies and eat leftovers without feeling like we HAD to.  I even have enough left over to freeze for a few lunches in the future.  I will definitly make this again.

This was very good and easy to make (I don't like to cook and don't do it well but this was even easy enough for me!)  Everyone in the family loved it, I used bowtie pasta for the little one added Italian Sausage for the bf.  Like other reviewers said it makes ALOT.  We will have leftovers for at least 2 more meals, so maybe cut the recipe in half if you aren't into leftovers!

Just tried this recipe; didn't like the corn in it, and added two cloves crushed garlic, which made it taste better.

Very good. I agree with several reviewers, to use fresh from the garden veggies and only revert to the canned in winter. I didn't feel the need to add corn anyway with the starch of the pasta so left it out. I did add 1 pound Italian pork sausage, (crumbled and browned) and that added a tasty bonus. Next time I will increase the cheese to 3 cups, and put half in the middle and save the other half for the top.  A full recipe fit my CorningWare oversize casserole (12.25" x 10.50" x 2.5") perfectly, and would easily serve 16 people "normal" size servings, and for a pot luck would serve 24 smaller servings.  I went easy on the red pepper and cut the final simmer time to 10 minutes.

I didn't find this "easy" as other reviewers said.  It is LOTS of volume and took LOTS of bowls and pans.  Then, it was bland.  I used fresh tomatoes but that was the only change I made. I added one fresh hot pepper from the garden to spice it up, but it wasn't enough.  Needs salt and/or parmesan for starters and something spicy. Rotel next time.

Absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made were to use whole wheat penne, use 2 small cans of diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic, and basil, and omitted the corn and peppers.  This is a keeper!

So great!  We were looking for a recipe to use up our garden veggies and this was perfect!  I was worried after I had it in the oven because I realized I forgot the onion and it also has no meat in it and we were having my dad over for dinner, but both him and my husband went for seconds!  Soo good...and healthy!
