This was a good pound cake though I cannot vouch for the baking time. There are only the two of us, so I baked this is muffin tins for 20 minutes so I could freeze the little cakes for future use. Tasty as a base for fresh strawberries and whipping cream. Thanks for sharing!

07-26-16 ~ Delicious! I was looking for an easy, but delicious pound cake, and I found it with this recipe. I halved the recipe and got three (6"x3.5") pans. I had a bunch of fresh peaches we brought home from Kentucky that I wanted to top the cake with. It was wonderfully dense and moist at the same time. It baked with a nice crust and sliced like a dream. A great recipe that I will be using again.

Thank you Starfighter for graciously giving us this recipe; it was fantastic! I served it with sliced fresh peaches, gently sugared. I think next time I'll add a pinch of mace, because that's what my grandmother always did with her pound cakes. And perhaps your great grandmother Gunn,given where she is now,doesn't mind at all that you gave it to the world to share. Thanks again.

It was great.  Did 1/2 recipe & used a regular  (9 x 5 approx.) loaf pan.  Baked up like a dream - about 45-50 min.  It sagged a bit when I touched with finger for done-ness so grabbed a toothpick which came out clean so I pulled it out then. Nice and buttery ( I used only butter) and in place of milk, I used half 'n half. No problem getting out of pan. I added a bit of almond extract - about 1/2 tsp or so;  left out lemon.  Conclusion - either I'm getting a lot quicker at making  pound cakes or this one was just plain easy/ straightforward. It was used as a base for "Raspberry Trifle" from this site.

This is a delicious pound cake. It is very easy to make and probably will freeze well.

Made this as part of a strawberry shortcake trifle. Absolutely delicious. I used one loaf for the trifle & ended up eating the second all by itself, it was so good!
