Loved this! Although, several changes were made. I added diced onions and green peppers along with minced garlic to the ground beef. Topped with shredded colby jack instead of american slices. This was excellent with these few additions and changes. Thanks!

My whole family loved this very easy dish. I used cream of mushroom soup, because I didn't have any cream of celery soup. It came out delicious!

Two simple additions make this recipie a family pleaser. Add 1tbsp of onion seasoning and 1tbsp of garlic seasoning. That gives it the extra flavor it needs. I used shredded cheese (it is what I had on hand) but I think it would be fine as written.  Tip: don't have your burner too high after you add the potatoes, it can burn to the pan.

This was pretty bland! It's an ok starter recipe, but I managed to doctor it up by adding 1/2 packet of taco seasoning mix and 1/2 jar of medium salsa. Instead of the American Cheese I used 1/2 cup of Taco Blend Cheese. I added 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and 1 cup of frozen corn. I topped it with sour cream, black olives, and tortilla strips....so basically it ended up being a totally different recipe, but at least it tasted great!

I changed this recipe. I used cheddar cheese instead of american, mushroom soup instead of celery. I used some tomato paste with water and took out the ketchup and worcestershire sauce. I added garlic and onions. It was excellent.

Really really simple and quick! I added some spices and bell peppers with onions for a little more flavor, but overall great recipe!

Very fast and very easy.  I used many of the suggestion previously but I used a packet of French Onion Soup mix instead of taco seasoning.  I also added 1 cup of frozen corn, garlic and a green pepper to the beef while it was cooking.  I also used cream of mushroom soup and topped with grated cheddar cheese.  Even my picky 5 yr old ate this one.

Very bland!  I even made some changes to spice it up and it still tasted like mush.

My husband like it though, go figure.

Good recipe. My husband loved it and went back for seconds. It didn't "wow" me, but it was good and I would make it again. Super easy to make and not a lot of ingredients needed.

To the hamburger I added 1/2 onion & green pepper (diced), black pepper, & a little garlic powder. While that is all cooking I baked 3 med potatoes in microwave. I diced the potatoes after they were done and added to the burger mixture once it was finished cooking and browned together. Then added wet ingredients. Cooking time doesn't need to me as much since potatoes are already cooked. I added shredded cheddar to top of dish & let melt. Next time I'll probably use Mushroom soup instead since we like that flavor a little better.

This recipe was very mushy and while the food tasted okay, it sat in the fridge as leftovers--no one ate it.

Honestly, I didn't like this at all, but my small children absolutely loved it.  So, I am going to mark it as an unlikely success.  The only thing I changed about it, was that I added onion, shredded cheddar instead of the slices, S and P.  Like I said...a perfect kid-type meal.

My 7 year old son said "4 stars Mom!" It was easy and tasty. I used tomato paste instead of ketchup since my husband hates ketchup (too sweet). I also added diced garlic, carrots, celery and green peas. It could do with a stronger flavour, maybe taco spice when cooking the beef, but otherwise it was a hit with the family.

This dish had a really weird, sour taste that I didn't expect. Maybe it comes from the ketchup/Worcestershire sauce combination. The basic idea is really good, though. I think I'll do it again with maybe broccoli cheese soup and some frozen broccoli. My kids really liked it, though, so maybe it's just me.

My whole family liked this recipe. I did take some advice from others and seasoned it up a bit. I added 1/2tsp. of onion powder, 1 tsp. of ground black pepper, and 1 tsp. of BBQ seasoning rub. I sprinkled these on while the beef was browning. I will make this again....

I skipped the hamburger, used cream of chicken.  Added garlic and onion powders and some hamburger seasoning and ground mustard.  Topped it off with Parm. Chicken Topping that was left over in the fridge.  Pretty passable for an improvised creation. Served it as a side.

First time for a comment as recipes I have tried have been good.  With this one, even with taking suggestions for adding spices this dish was way to soupy and not much flavor.

I had browned up some beef one night for a quick spaghetti dinner when I realized I was out of pasta.  I came across this recipe on an ingredient search.  I thought it looked terrible, but sometimes you're just in a pinch and have to hope for the best!  Well, it was every bit as bad as I thought it would be!  I cooked it per the recipe.  It had no flavor and just seemed like mush.

After reading the reviews I made changes. I added onion, green bell pepper, shredded carrots, and garlic.  Even after these adjustments this meal was still lacking.  There wasn't much flavor.  I couldn't suggest what else to add to improve this recipe.  Will not be trying again.

Kids loved this, I'm not so sure yet. Might take getting use to but will make again cause the kids loved it. I did change it to suit a gluten free diet for a kid. instead of cream of celery i used cream and celery seed with pepper and salt to taste. Subtracted the water and added a little corn starch to thicken. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good. With the beef I threw in a stalk of celery, about half of an onion, a few cloves of garlic and seasoned the mix with seasoned salt and pepper. I used a packet of french onion soup mix and also added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, pepper and a quarter-cube of chicken bouillon. Oh, and I tossed in a Goya Sazon packet and a Goya ham concentrate packet. Instead of ketchup I used A1. I had some Simply Potatoes southwestern style on hand, they worked fine. 
This may sound complex, but the flavors married quite well. I plopped six heaping tablespoons into two flour tortillas topped with sharp shredded cheddar. Very tasty and savory.

It was good.  I seasoned the beef with salt, pepper and garlic powder, and added half a large onion to cook with the beef.  Increased the water to 3/4 of a cup, should have been a full cup, added garlic powder to the sauce mixture and one cup of frozen peas.

This dish was surprisingly good! I didn't however use frozen hashbrowns. Instead I made them fresh and it turned out ok. Also, next time I think I'll add some fresh onion and green pepper for added flavor.

Not a bad recipe. Took suggestions from other reviews and added onion, green peppers, and corn. I also used Colby jack cheese instead and used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Turned out ok.

I enjoyed this recipe because it was simple, quick and very tasty. It was something different from the same ole, same ole. My husband even commented that it was good and if he commented at all, feel lucky! haha
