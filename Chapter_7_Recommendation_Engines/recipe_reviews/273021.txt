Followed the recipes exactly. It was a little spicy (good) and really needed salt. . No distinct flavor, nothing to really define it, a little bland. Also, this recipe made a very large portion - probably would feed 8. That would be good info to have on recipe - I would have cut in half.

Made it tonight.  the flavor was similar to vegetarian chili con carne. That seems to be due to the 2 t. of chili powder that over-powered the other spices. 
I cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/8t, which still gave it a bite (hot, but not overly so). 
It would have been nice to know what size the onions and tomatoes should be, as there are no 'cup' measurements.  Next time I will cut the chili powder to 3/4t. in hope the Indian spice flavor will stand out better.  And, I'll put in spinach or swiss chard toward the end.

I made a couple changes to this recipe. It sounded like too much spice, so reduced cumin and coriander by almost half. I also used saut√© chicken. Instead of the cheese. It turned out delicious and not too spicy at all. I also left out the frozen peas and water.
