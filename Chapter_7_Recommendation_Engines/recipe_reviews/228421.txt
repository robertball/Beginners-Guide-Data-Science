I did not have vanilla flavored soy milk. What I did instead was use regular low-fat milk and I had frozen a container of Yoplait Light Very Vanilla yogurt to use instead of ice cream. Even with my substitutions, this was DELICIOUS.

Man, oh man, I think Hubs set a record this morning on how fast you can slurp down a smoothie!  In fact, he said the fact that it went down so quickly speaks for itself in terms of his "review" for AR.  Because it included ice cream rather than yogurt it was already a positive for me, as I don't care for the tang of yogurt in smoothies. As for Hubs, he simply appreciated it for something different than the typical yogurt-based smoothie.  I don't use soy milk I'm afraid, so I used regular milk with a dribble of of vanilla, a premium quality vanilla gelato, all frozen strawberries and a good-sized, ripe and juicy peach. My Vita-Mix took care of any peach peels or strawberry seeds handily, but I'm curious how a regular household blender would do on those peels. This is creamy, refreshing, pleasantly sweet with equally balanced flavors of the strawberries and peaches.  Hubs found this quite filling, so unfortunately (for me, anyway) I don't think I'll be making our Saturday morning breakfast!  As the first reviewer of this smoothie recipe, discovered because of an ingredient search for smoothies using peaches, I can happily rate this a hit..with BOTH of us.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have vanilla soy milk, so I used unsweetened almond milk and added a splash of vanilla extract and agave syrup. For the ice cream I used Breyers 1/2 the fat vanilla. ty

Wow! As a Chef, I don't like putting peaches in the drinks I make. But Man oh Man, for this, I had to! The texture is smooth and great. Amazing!

I kind of just used this recipe as a guideline. I did not use ice cream or soy milk. Instead I used what I feel is a healthier alternative of 2% milk and low fat organic yogurt. I also did not have any frozen strawberries so I used all fresh. Finally, to boost the nutritional value a touch more, I added around two handfuls of kale. The best part with that is you can't taste it! My picky eater of a boyfriend couldn't even taste it! It does turn it green though.

This smoothie was very good and refreshing. It was so simple and it only took about 20 minutes. Maybe next time we can put more ice cream.

I’ve made this both following the recipe and going a little off from it and both times it was delicious. The recipe is a little too liquidity for my personal preference, but that’s just my opinion so it still gets five stars. The second time I made it I just used all frozen strawberries and completely skipped the milk. This made it thicker which I really enjoyed.  No matter how you make it this is still an amazing recipe and I encourage everyone to try it if you have some peaches.

We used 2% milk and also some blueberries and it tasted great. Add a little whey protein and you got a muscle smoothie.

I did not enjoy this smoothie. It was too liquidy so i had to add a lot of yogurt and more icecream and way more strawberries. Overall, it was a good smoothie once i made my tweaks .
