Simple and great! My fiance loved how juicy and tender it was. For a more simpler version with less ingredients (we're on a budget!) just use olive oil, salt, pepper, minced garlic and lemon juice. Heat the oil and garlic on medium heat. I salted (I used sea salt) and pepper both sides, and cook each side for about 2-3 minutes. Then, add in the lemon juice. As the directions already say, simmer for about 6 minutes, covered. I was sure to flip the chicken about half way through. Enjoy!

this chicken was outstanding!  i doubled the recipe and used all chicken broth, and was true to the recipe as it is written.  it made the most delicious sauce - i served with rolls and broccoli and we were all pouring the sauce over the bread and veggie it was soooo good. it had a nice and unique flavor, and i'm always searching for something "different" but good.  my kids ate this, my husband loved it, and i will definitely make again.  very good recipe!  and not too garlicky, believe it or not! thanks.

My husband and I thought that this was very good.  I used the chicken broth instead of the wine.  And between the simmering sauce and the final sauce I used the entire can of broth.
I did make a few modifactions...
* pound chicken breasts thin so they cook faster
* once I took the chicken out of the pan I smashed/pressed the garlic to spread it through the sauce.
I did think this dish was a little salty but it was probably from all the chicken broth.  I will be making this again.

Very good recipe, I tried to make it healthier by cutting back on the oil and adding fresh basil. Turned out really well, will be making this again soon!

This recipe is simple and totally flavorful. The chicken remains tender because of the broth (I didn't use the wine) and the lemon juice provides just a hit of sour. This has now become a part of my dinner arsenal with great success!

Fantastic!  Didn't change a thing!  It was very tender and moist.  Loved all the garlic!  Thanks for another keeper from this site.

LOVE this recipe. It has all my favorites: garlic, moist chicken, basil, and simplicity (salt, pepper, olive oil) blended in. My substitutions: I thinly sliced three fresh basil leaves instead of dried; used olive oil; and used about twice as much homemade chicken broth in the cooking process. I kept the 1/4 cup for the sauce, however. If you like sauce -- and this is fantabulous sauce - double all ingredients for 2-3 chicken breasts.

My husband loves garlic, so when it was just the two of us for dinner (kids were at Grandma's) I made this recipe. It was delicious! I followed the other members suggestions and mashed the garlic to make a smooth gravy. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. The only criticism my husband had was that he wanted more gravy to go on top! So next time I will double the sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was pretty garlicky for us...BUT it was realllly good and I will definitely do this again...maybe with a tad less garlic.  I think next time I might even add more broth to have extra sauce at the end.  Went great over rice!

I couldn't get the chicken breasts to cook in the time allotted without burning the garlic.  Maybe pounding them out would've helped?  It's entirely possible I just had a bad cooking day, but it just didn't turn out for me.

Don't let the 10 cloves of garlic scare you away. They roast to a lightly sweet and roasted flavor after cooking so don't worry about blending them in a sauce, just maybe chop them up into quarters before adding to the chicken to save you a step. I used fresh herbs (double the amount if you use fresh herbs) instead of dried, but for those of you that might think the dish is bland, try adding half a jalapeno pepper (chopped) when adding the garlic. I didn't skimp on the black pepper either, probably used more like 1/2 tsp. As for the sauce as it's simmering, just add more cornstarch/broth blend to give you as much sauce as you want until you're satisfied with the amount.

This is a great garlic chicken recipe!  I followed the recipe...used white wine...I smashed the garlic and chopped it...served it over rice...it was a big hit!  Even my picky 2 year old liked it!

This was amazing!  I will make it all the time!  My kids, my husband, my friends all loved it!  Thank-you! My only recommendation would be to smash the garlic so that it's soft when you make the gravy.

Pounded my chicken breasts thin to decrease cooking time. Overall, the sauce was just okay. Can't say that I could actually notice the flavor of 10 cloves of garlic. This would be decent to prepare again, just not necessarily a "Great" recipe.

It was just OK.  Felt it was pretty bland even with all that garlic, it was just missing something. The family wasn't really impressed either.  No one asked for seconds!

This was good enough that I will make it again, but I'll probably add a little more garlic, or be sure to put sauce on my plate! I would have liked a little more flavor.

I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't actually eat this, but I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. This is a recipe I'll be saving for him. I used less garlic, about half the amount, and didn't really mince it, I crushed it and then chopped it a bit - this lets out the juices (and flavor) more. I also added a little garlic powder to make sure that the garlic flavor got into the chicken. I added about half a can of broth to the chicken while it was simmering because there wasn't enough liquid after a few minutes. I didn't even bother with the broth and the cornstarch for the sauce, I just poured some of the liquid that was left over onto the chicken cutlets.

I really liked this recipe... I minced the garlic and added some vegetables (zuccini, broccoli, carrots) to the broth/sauce while it simmered for a few minutes and ended up with perfect, slightly-firm and delicious vegetables. It's the only way so far I've actually been able to get my boyfriend to LIKE vegetables.

Wonderful!  The liquid had reduced significantly by the time the chicken was done, so I added some extra wine while mashing the garlic to make the sauce. It was great over new potatoes.  I'll definitely be making this again, thanks!

Not bad.  Unlike many other reviewers who used the chicken broth as a substitute, I used the white wine.  I didn't dislike this recipe but wasn't quite as impressed as I expected to be.

My husband just said this was the best chicken he's ever had!  Few tweaks--I omitted the salt since one reviewer said it was too salty, and added 1/4 cup sauteed mushrooms to the gravy.

My husband and I really like this.  It was easy and quick.  I used the broth, not the wine and thought it was perfect.  I'll make this again.

It's okay.  Didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked, I didn't get the garlic flavor even though it has 10 garlic cloves in it (wonder if it was my cloves??).  I did mash the cloves to make the sauce like someone else suggested - It was a nice idea, but it just wasn't what i expected.

I got great feedback from this dish when I made it and brought to everyone at work. There is nothing to change. Just a simple, wonderful recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong but this recipe did not appeal to me.
