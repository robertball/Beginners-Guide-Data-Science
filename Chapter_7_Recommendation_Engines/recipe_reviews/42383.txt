I have been making this for years and it's always a hit. It's a pie, not a cheesecake so don't expect one. Mine was a little loose one time but every other time it's set up fine. I liked it better when I used two bricks of cream cheese but no one else did so I keep it as written except I always use FF S.C. milk and sometimes light cream cheese. Very refreshing and light and I love to make it in the summer. I'm wondering if the looseness is caused by not getting the milk well-shaken and leaving some of "thick stuff" in the can. Just a thought.

My husband said that this was the perfect lime pie.  Not too tart, not too sweet, with just the right "lime" flavor.  It was creamy, but not runny, and the graham cracker crust was the perfect bottom for this pie.  We have enjoyed this many times already and will continue to enjoy it in the future!

It is very rare for everyone in my family (from 9 to 73) to all like the same thing, which is what happened when I served this. HOWEVER, it seemed a bit loose and missing something (and I always totally remove the tops from my condensed milk cans and scrape them out with a spatula, so that was not the reason) so I added an extra package of cream cheese (this time a low fat one) and folded in some of the whipped cream. I thought I was only salvaging the pie in order to have something ready for dessert, but it turned out to be loved by every single person who tried it (and they usually have vastly different taste preferences!).

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and this was PERFECT!! I was a little leery about the vanilla at first because I didn't want it to take over the lime flavor but it made the pie SOOO much better. It takes the tartness away just enough to make it perfect and you can't really taste the vanilla. Thank you soooo much for this recipe. It is totally a keeper in this house! :-)

This was good pie! I folded 1/2 of the whipped topping into the filling and topped it w/ the other 1/2. Mine set fine and cut beautifully! This was very nice and refreshing w/o the lime being too overpowering...a nice balance of sweet and tart. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The two stars are for the recipe as written - even when refrigerated, it does not set up well. However, when I added 2/3 of the whipped topping, it came together perfectly. I topped the pie with some whipped cream - absolutely delicious! It turned out great in the end.

This is my first time reviewing any recipes, but I felt I had to because this pie was great & EVERYTHING I have made from this site has been wonderful!  I was concerned about it setting up (from what I had heard from other reviewers) so I folded in about 6 oz of whipped topping and then refrigerated, and trust me, if you do this you will have NO problem with it setting.  Also another thing I enjoyed was that the lime flavor was present but not overpowering at all.  Very simple, very fast, and very economical.  Made it for a dessert for a BBQ at one in the afternoon and it was ready by dinnertime.  Definitely will be going in my "no bake" dessert rotation!

Wonderful and so easy to make!  I like lime flavor and you can taste the lime, but the flavor is not overwhelming.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is now my signature pie to make for friend and family events, since I have a lime tree for my own lime juice!  Everyone loves it.  I grate some the peel of one lime into the whipped topping to add a little more flavor to the pie. Delish!

It never set and had the consistency of pudding, and the taste was worse.  didn't even taste like cheesecake.

The taste on this was fabulous--but mine didn't set :-(  I made a coconut shortbread crust, the lime cheesecake layer from this and then topped it with fresh mango--rave reviews!

We thought this recipe was good. Since there are no egg yolks, it's very light and fluffy. I topped it with toasted walnuts just to give it a little texture.

This is so easy and delicious.  I used fat free cream cheese and it turned out perfectly.  Not a very stong lime flavor, which was fine with me.  It is even better the next day!

I followed the recipe according to the instructions...my pie didn't 'set up' firmly enough so even though the flavor was very nice...the looseness was a disappointment. 
I have read some of the reviews now and will do things differently if I make this pie again. I think the recipe, as it is written, needs to be altered as it appears that the looseness is a frequent occurrance

I have made this recipe many times and Love it.  I use the recipe as written but instead of using frozen topping I use my own real whipped topping.  Being that I never make pie's I put it into Tart Shells and it is always a huge hit... :) thanks for the recipe

Very refreshing.  I used a purchased graham cracker crust and it was larger so I doubled the filling recipe and it was perfect.  My family ate it in no time so I have no idea if it would store well

This recipe is super easy and really delicious - a great way to end a Mexican meal.  I freeze the pie once it's finished and serve it frozen, and it's really refreshing.  I also thinly slice fresh mint and zest some lime for the top for extra flavor in place of the lime slices for garnish.  It gives the pie an extra layer of lime flavor and the addition of the extra mint has earned it the nickname "mojito pie."  People ask for the recipe and then are amazed that it's so easy.

This was a simple and tasty recipe, though I did need to make some modifications. I followed the original instructions regarding refrigeration, but it still didn't turn out solid enough. I ended up freezing it, which gave it a better texture. However, if you do freeze it, be advised that it needs to sit at room temp. for 10mn or so to thaw it a bit before serving.

A really good and easy recipe! A hit at a potluck...also used fat free cream cheese, still loved it!
