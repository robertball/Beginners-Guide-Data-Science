This is a must during the winter holidays in our house.  I have been to some large Danish parties where they use gallon jugs of Sangria with the addition of the other alcohol so I may try that.  You can also serve raisins and dried cranberries soaked in dark rum on the side along with the slivered almonds.  A truly wonderful drink that will get a lot of comments from those who may not be familiar with it.  A definite party maker!!!   Skoal!

Growing up with a Swedish family this was a staple of Christmas, the smell is so sweet and wonderful. This is exactly how my father makes it. Be prepared though for the kick and don't expect to drink too much!

Winter and freezing cold outside, but a glass of this Swedish Glogg made a whole lot of warmth inside.

Just like what my grandfather used to make. Warms the heart, and the blue flames make a spectacular show that will break the ice at even the stiffest of gatherings. 

Sometimes I use rum instead of whiskey. 

Can adapt this to non-alcholic, one liter apple juice, one liter cranberry juice, one lemon sliced. Add the same amount of spices and simmer.

I followed commenter Cynthia Lerner's suggestion and made this in a percolator. I divided the wine and liquor by five -- 1 bottle of port and 1/5-bottle (5 oz.) each of bourbon and rum -- but used the same amount of spices as called for in the recipe. Put the spices in  the percolator basket, turn it on and let it run its cycle. I made this on Christmas Eve. I measured out the ingredients ahead of time so it was quick and easy to make. People loved it, especially the way the alcoholic fumes go up your nose when you drink it.

Excellent!  For years we've used a recipe from some Swedish neighbors, but I thought I'd mix things up this year and try this recipe.  It makes a LOT, so I cut it roughly in half but used about the same amount of spices.  (And for a very non-Scandinavian touch, I used some watermelon-infused vodka I had on hand from a summer party and substituted dried cranberries since I was out of raisins.)  It was a huge hit Christmas eve!

Great idea about pouring back into the bottles for storage, BTW.

I grew up in Sweden and still have family there and visit on a regular basis. I have had and made my fair share of glögg, including my grandmother's recipe. This is by far the best one to date. I don't even drink bourbon, but enjoy including it in the glögg. I'm still trying to grasp how good this recipe works. It's simply the best! That said, I made one modification: I doubled the amount of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. I also don't put the spices in a cheese cloth...just strain after it has cooled down a bit.

I've been making this for years (decades, actually) and love this recipe.  It's great to serve at a Holiday party instead of having to set up a bar.  I use the same wine and spices, however, I cut the liquor to one 750 ml liter of brandy.  The advice given is very good, use really cheap liquor and wine, the spices completely rule the flavor.  I also cook this is a 30 cup percolator putting the sugar, spices and fruit in the basket.  I also cut up and use a whole orange.  By the time it perks thru its done.  Serve from the coffee pot so it stays warm.

I make this every year. Wonderful recipe. I use two bottles of port and three Cabernet Sauvignon. I also cut back on the sugar. I prefer it less sweet. You can’t go wrong with this on a cold winter night sitting outside by a fire. Warms you to your toes. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.

It is a touch strong, but really tasty. Fantastic for a really cold night. May add a few more cloves and another cinnamon stick next time. Will definitely make again.

Great Glögg Recipe! I love that Port is used in place of traditional Reds, which tends to make me really sleepy.

The volume of the chatter at mom's last Christmas increased five-fold as soon as a few of the ladies had a few sips.  Absolutely delish and perfect a few weeks later when ice skating on the canal in Ottawa Canada in -15C weather.
