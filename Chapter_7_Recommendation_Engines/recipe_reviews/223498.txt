I increased this recipe to use 1 1/2 pounds ground beef. I made this meat loaf with my youngest son. We followed this recipe closely only using dijon mustard and adding a good amount of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning, which is also from this site. When we started mixing the meat loaf together, it was VERY wet. Like "how is this going to hold together" wet. We added another half cup of bread crumbs to hold it together. I used my Perfect Meatloaf Pan to make this--it was PACKED. I did follow the directions to sprinkle the french fried onions over the meat loaf but I was worried about how those onions would stick to the top with the meat loaf halfway cooked. What I did was spread a good amount of ketchup over the top of the meat loaf, then sprinkle the french fried onions over the ketchup. This did take two hours to bake in the Perfect Meatloaf Pan total. This did make a good meat loaf, with a good amount of both bacon and cheese. I'm glad I added the additional spice mixture because I think it would have been bland without it. I wouldn't have thought that adding a minimal amount of mayonnaise would make a difference but it really does. I served this with garlic dills, Meme's Mashed Potatoes (Southern Plate recipe) and Cajun Buttered Corn.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Due to dietary needs in our family, I had to make the following changes:  used low sodium turkey bacon, a 19 oz. pkg. of ground turkey, an 8 oz. pkg. of non-dairy cheddar cheese, Egg Beaters, and omitted the onions.  This meatloaf was so moist and flavorful.  Even my ultra picky 10 year old had seconds.  Thanks for this recipe!

After finding this recipe, the hubby wanted to give it a try, and it was pretty good!  This meatloaf will occasionally make the rotation of "staple" meals in our household.  I actually thinked we liked it better reheated on the second day, as the bacon flavour seemed to meld more.  The only things I did a little differently; I added only 1 egg based on another reviewer's suggestion that the meatloaf was too mushy (but I will add the second egg next time) and instead of mixing the cheese into the loaf, I placed 3/4 of the meat mixture in the meatloaf pan, then layered all the called for cheese (sliced into 1/4 inch slices, rather than shredded) on top, then topped with the remaining 1/4 meat mixure.  We ended up with a gooey cheese "middle" that was yummy!

Try adding 2 slices of bread to the bottom of the baking dish. This will absorb any extra grease from the meat. Once  you remove the meatloaf from the cooking pan (dish) cut off the grease soaked bread before serving.

Very good! I realized that I did not get the French-fried onions @ the store (doh!), so I just chopped some onion and added it to the meat mixture. I had more than 1 pound of beef (more like 1-3/4 pound, lol), so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, except for the eggs, which I kept at 2, added in a little garlic powder and I doubled the sauce mixture (I was glad I did b/c it was good). I also needed to add more breadcrumbs than called for. While this didn't taste 'just like' a bacon cheeseburger, it was very flavorful, moist and yummy! We all enjoyed it, and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

First try on this one. After cooking the full hour, we let it cook a bit and "turned" it out on to a plate. While the flavor was good it was "mush. It did not hold together at all. If I tried it again I guess I might try and put more bread crumbs in as the other reader suggested and cut way back on the mustard. It was a little strong for our taste.

Super good and super easy to make.  I'm not a fan of the traditional meatloaf, but this variation was amazing and my 5 yr old asked for seconds.  I highly recommend using top quality beef.  I used a not so top grade and it came out very oily.  Other than that it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!

My family loved this , although I would not serve it every day.  But as an occasional meal it is tasty and well received!  It deserves five stars for flavor!

This is a very good meatloaf recipe however I must give kudos to Paula Deen as this is her recipe right down to the exact name, ingredients, measurements and directions.  Thanks to the submitter for sharing such a great recipe with everyone.

I have made this recipe several times. The only thing I did different was used less bacon. I think 10 slices is too much. Cut it down to 4 just for flavoring. Quick super easy recipe. Almost always have the ingredients on hand so go to this recipe when I don't feel like going to the store. Like today when the wind chill is below zero.

Since I grind my own ground round, which is much leaner than ground chuck, I just mixed some of the bacon grease from cooking the bacon.  Had to add more breadcrumbs, of course, but worth it.

I read through the reviews, increased the breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup (and I used Panko/all I had).  Family loved it - a little greasy though.  I actually think the grease might come from the French-fried onions?  I used 85/15, rendered the bacon, etc. I would definitely make again and might simply cut the bacon to 4-5 slices.  I think I'd also either omit the french fried onions or halve that amount also.  It definitely was the most moist, flavorful meatloaf I've ever had.  I think if I tweak it a bit more with the above mentioned ideas, it will quickly switch to 5 stars!

I followed the recipe "almost" exactly as written.  I had 90/10 ground beef in freezer so I used that, when I was mixing the meat it was really wet, so as another reviewer suggested I added a little more bread crumbs.  I added a small chopped onion to the mixture also.  I put half the cheese in the meat mixture, and saved the other half.  I spooned half the meat into the loaf pan, sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top, then put remaining meat on top.  Then spooned the rest of the ketchup/mustard mixture on top.  Cooked for 1 hour.  Sprinkled the fried onions on top and cooked another 30 min.  It came out great !!!!!!!!!  Like the one reviewer said, you will get a "gooey" center.  It tastes like a bacon cheeseburger.  Excellent !!!!!!!!!!  Will make again

No one in my household cared for this.  10 slices of bacon releases a lot of grease and it was just too much - a soppy mess.  The half pound of cheese only added to the oil.  The oi/grease level was almost to the top of the pan.  If I were to make it again, I would reduce the bacon and half-cook it in a pan first to render off some of the fat.  I would also cut the cheese in half.  The other thing my family did  not like about it was the saltiness.  The bacon, ketchup and cheese combined made it very salty.

why is the picture of the recipe sometimes different than the actual recipe. This one shows onions mixed in the meatloaf, but the recipe does not call for that????

After reading other complaints about it being too greesy I made a couple of changes.  I added dried onions to soak up some greese.  I went ahead and used light mayo.  I added 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs and used the breadcrumbs on top instead of the fried onions.  I also used Hormel real crumbled bacon bits instead of cooking up fresh bacon.  It turned out fantastic!

I didn't have the french fried onions so I minced about 2T of onions and sauteed them in the bacon drippings, then drained and added them into the meatloaf mixture.  Added extra breadcrumbs as per many suggestions.  It was very good.  Next time will cut down the mustard to 1t. Also, I used 96% ground beef and a meatloaf pan which helped with the oil.  Very good, everyone liked it so I will make it again.

Yummy! I have made this several times and I think I've just figured out the presentation. I line the loaf pan with bread to soak up extra liquid. After 1 hour of cooking, I flipped the loaf into a small casserole dish, loaded it with ketchup topping, fried onion, and extra bacon. Yummy!

I left out the onions, and I didn't have raw bacon on hand but did have precooked bacon bits for salads.  Used 2 lbs of burger so doubled everything else except the egg.  Some reviewers said they increased the bread crumbs, but I decided to only use 1 egg and didn't have trouble with the consistency.  I also took a recommendation and put some sliced cheese in the middle.  I've tried that before with shredded and it didn't stay together so thought sliced would make a difference --- nope!  I also cut the cheese in small cubes (1/4 inch or so) to mix in with the burger because last time I did something similar the shredded cheese had oozed its way out of the loaf.  the cubes seems to work to keep most of it in, but some still was swimming in the grease. I couldn't taste much bacon, but that's my own fault for not using fresh.

This recipe is OK, but it isn't awesome for us. Awesome concept though. I will most likely make again, but with fresh bacon.  If any of my opinion changes I'll edit my comments.

My family went CRAZY for this! I have never stepped outside of "mom's" recipe of traditional meatloaf cause my family was so sentimental about it. Well, sentiment has flown out the window.

We loved this.  Baked in a clay loaf pan in a convection oven and it was done in 30 mins.   Added the french fried onion rings and turned the oven off until the mashed potatoes were ready.  Would definitely will make again

This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever had! The bacon made it! I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and replaced plain yogurt with the mayo. I did not want to use the french fried onions so just cut up some onion. This is a 10 out of 5!!

I'm not even a big fan of bacon, but this was by far one of the best meatloaf recipes I have made.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome! Followed the recipe exactly, but I skipped the French fried onions, and put some bacon strips on top instead. Will make this again !

It was good, super greasy though with the cheese and meat. I would add atleast another half cup of bread crumbs to hold it together. Also I folded the onions inside the mixture (super yummy) very fun play on meatloaf!

I made this with alterations. I .used 1lb of burger & 1 lb of Italian sausage. Just one egg cause I'm sensitive to egg whites. Also I used an envelope of onion soup mix & no salt.  It was so.good.my husband does not ever want another kind of meatloaf ever again.

We really liked this recipe very much!  I only used 8 pieces of bacon as that was all I had and otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  This is one that we'll definitely be making again and again.  We both loved the mustard flavor in it, but then we're yellow mustard fanatics.  I saw comments that it was somewhat mushy but we didn't experience that.  I let it sit in the pan for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven and it held together perfectly.

My family and I loved this recipe. We don't have meatloaf often but when we do this will be our go-to. I didn't follow the exact recipe, I used Weber hamburger seasoning instead of adding just salt and pepper. I was also out of Worcestershire so I just ommited it. I drained off the fat before I applied a ketchup and brown sugar sauce to the top and threw it under the broiler for 5 minutes. I didn't find it to be too greasy and it stuck together perfectly.

Love this recipe! Husband likes it too, so it's a keeper! I made it as is, except the french-fried onions. I subbed in white onion to make up for it. I've made this twice, the first time with microwave bacon, the second with traditional pan cooked bacon, each time subbing in white onion. Others said their loaf was mushy, mine wasn't. I used a tad bit over 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, not enough to make a difference though. When I make this next, I think I will leave out the salt.

I loved this recipe!!!!! I usually make my gmas meatloaf but thought this looked good. I had no problems with it being mush like others did. I did add a handful more breadcrumbs while I was mixing it up so maybe that made the difference. It stayed together very nicely. All I might do different is add a few less onions on top just a personal preference it was great as written

Excellent!!  The only thing I did different was use Bacon Bits (the real ones) instead of cooking strips of bacon.   Will definitely make again !!

My husband Usually doesn’t like meatloaf but I made this meatloaf and he really liked it said it was a keeper the only thing I did different was I didn’t have the French fried onions so I took a fresh onion and chopped it up and fried it with the bacon and just put it right into the meatloaf and it was really delicious thank you for the recipe

NOT a fan. It was moist. it just wasn't wow. it is also the exact recipe on Paula Dean's recipe list. That last part is observation . I picked this one because Paula Dean rarely steers me wrong. won't be making it again.

This is Paula Deen's recipe to a tee...It's great ...She does give a tip on placing bread slices on the bottom of the pan to soak up some of the grease..Reviewer below who said it was soppy mess  gave it 1 star said and she would cook the bacon next time, she didn't follow the recipe, the bacon was suppose to be cooked and drained......On one of her videos Paula does use 2 tabls. brown sugar  along with ketchup and the mustard for the topping.....I find the sweet topping is more to my personal liking

My husband and I loved it!  I have a great meat loaf pan that has a silicone liner with holes in it so I never have excess grease.  We love meat loaf and as written this recipe was great.  One pound of meat was just right for us.

read reviews before making, and the only things I changed (besides doubling the recipe) were 1. I used Velveeta and put a 1\4" thick layer in the middle. 2. I probably doubled the bread crumbs while mixing to obtain a good consistency. 3. I added about 1\2 cup (1\4 cup per recipe) of dill relish, to really finish that cheeseburger flavor. it turned out amazing and even better the next day! Don't forget to let it cool before you cut into it if you layer the cheese so that it doesn't all ooze out!

The flavor of this meatloaf was great but I wasn't crazy for the texture. I should have used more breadcrumbs when I saw the mixture was too wet. I used about 1-1/4 lbs of chuck and 6 slices bacon. I baked in a loaf pan that had a rack on the bottom to catch the drippings. It was not greasy at all. Family loved it - I just wish it had been firmer.

This is hands-down my hubby's favorite meal!  I follow the recipe exactly and it is perfect every time!  We did try making burgers once but the meat is too mushy so we baked them in the oven...DELICIOUS!!!  The leftovers are heavenly...I think it gets better the next day!  Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

Amazing. I don't know how you couldn't give this 5 stars.  My husband was scraping the pan.  I formed it into a football shaped loaf instead of baking in a pan.

Absolutely wonderful.  My son asked what we were having for dinner.  I told him meatloaf.  He said gross.  Then he tried it.  He loved it!

I am not a meatloaf lover but this was surprisingly delicious.  I used crumbled ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Family ran for seconds before they were gone :)

This recipe is definitely a winner! I do agree with some of the previous posts that you need to add more breadcrumbs to help hold it together more, but even with it being crumbly it's still amazing!

Great recipe! My son kept gushing over it with every bite. I did not use onions and did not put the ketchup mixture on top. I put a squirt of ketchup and a squirt of mustard in with the meatloaf mixture. I also left out the salt and didn't miss it a bit. This recipe is now my favorite meatloaf recipe!

Great idea to use the french fried onions in meatloaf. I did not use bacon, mayo, mustard or cheese, but substituted chicken Stove-Top stuffing in place of breadcrumbs. I also used Catalina dressing in place of ketchup, and put a layer of BBQ sauce on the top, but no matter. I made it a two lb. loaf, increased the temp to 375 for an hour, and it came out perfect. I just wanted to let you know you inspired me and I just had what was on hand to make this meatloaf a success! My family loved it!

Fantastic recipe.  The flavor was great and my picky 3 year old loved it!  I'll definitely add some more breadcrumbs for a stiffer loaf, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty tasty but used 1/2 the bacon, no salt and ground round rather than ground check.  Also added green onion.  Next time I would increase meat to about 1.5 pounds.

Didn't like the cheese in it. May try again w/o the cheese as I'm trying the find just the right meatloaf & no luck yet. Don't understand why we didn't like, both like cheese & both would put cheese on a meatloaf sandwich.

This is absolutely scrumptious!!  I used 8 slices of bacon since mine is thick-sliced and the only prepared mustard I had was horseradish so cut that back to just over 1 tablespoon.  I agree that the meatloaf fell apart easily so may use more bread crumbs next time and cut back on the cooking time.  Edit - Made again with 1/3 C. bread crumbs & cooked for 50 minutes total.  Chopped half of a medium onion and mixed in i/o onions on top.  Worked better.

This is a new family fav! I used half the amount of Ketchup, and substituted BBQ sauce. In the final 20 min I sprinkled a bit more cheese and bread crumbs for the flair.

I made half measure, except for the mustard/ketchup mix.  I used a little bit of ketchup and made up the measure with an excellent tomato sauce.  I found the loaf tasteless - I think it needs garlic,herbs.  Something to liven it up.
I also found that it crumbled.  I was just SO disappointed.  I don't know what French fried onions are, so I pressed finely cut onions on top of the loaf.I will try again one day.

We loved this meat loaf recipe. My son very seldom comments on dinner but he said he liked this meatloaf. I have many different kinds. This was easy and great tasting.

Thought this recipe would be good for the kids. Taste was okay but the salt and saturated fat levels were too high.  Liked the idea though.

Not sure if it was the bacon we used but we found this to be very salty.

My family really enjoyed this. I found it a bit hard to serve as the cheese makes it very soft. I'm looking forward to trying leftovers cold for a sandwich. Since we raise our own meat and had lots of ground turkey, I used that instead of beef. It was still full of flavor.

Followed the recipe mostly - used 2 lbs of meat though, and no worsteshire sauce. Added a few tbsp of sweet/hot bbq sauce instead. Turned out amazing! Even the teenager loved it - and she never likes anything I cook. Instead of onions on top I mixed in one scallion to the meat mixture.

I didn't have any bacon at home, so I used crumbled bacon bits (the real kind, not the simulated ones).  I found it was almost too moist (fell apart).  Next time I would omit the onions (I didn't even use the full amount called for, but they were overpowering), I would leave out the mayo and would add some spice to it.  Probably garlic powder or crushed chilies.  Otherwise, the potential was there, I just wasn't hugely pleased with the end result.
