I made it just like the recipe and it was SO good! My husband loved it and that says a lot because I call him the Food Diva. My brother-in-law enjoyed it too. Everyone was stuffed and I would definitely make it again! The pepper gives it a nice kick too.

Not a new recipe to me - but one that I hadn't made in a long time.  One tip - if you let this sit and don't serve immediately, be prepared to add more milk.  I also upped the flavor a bit by using finely diced red onion browned with the beef and added a small amount of worcestershire sauce plus fresh chopped parsley.  Served over toast with sliced fresh tomatoes, this made a very satisfying meal.

I created this for supper one night when I didn't have anything else to cook but had all the ingredients on hand. Nothing fancy but really good - the whole family liked it! I added some red pepper flakes in it just for some added taste. Served it over biscuits, all of it was gone in a matter of minutes. Will make again :)

I am an Army brat and I have fond memories of my dad making SOS for me in the mornings before school when he was home.  I used this recipe today and it was wonderful.  Thank you so much for taking the time to put your recipe on here.  I didn't drain the beef, but I did use extra lean hamburger meat so that there wasn't quite so much grease in the skillet. :)  YUM! (And I think it is BEST over toast...the toastiness is nice with the gravy!)

I ate SOS almost every day for breakfast in the army for over 20 years, if it was avail. I just love the stuff. note that chicken bouilon is not part of the armys version of creamed beef, and this one is also missing worcestershire sauce.

Very hearty, stick-to-your ribs comfort food.  Made it exactly as written (used 73/27 ground beef) and it was very tasty.  May increase seasoning a bit next time.  I was worried it would be really peppery, but I actually couldn't really taste the pepper.  The spices were all nicely balanced, and not one flavor overpowered another, so if I do increase the seasoning, I'd keep them at the same ratio to each other.  :::EDIT::: I made this again with slightly leaner beef (80/20) and the sauce was WAY too thick this time around without that extra fat to soak up the flour.  It still tasted great (I did double the seasoning this time), but I think in the future when using 80/20 ground chuck I'll reduce the flour to 1/3 cup.

This was excellent.  My husband loved it.  However I did make a couple of additions to match our tastes.  I added a slice of diced red onion to the cooking meat mixture, and a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce when I added milk.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I did have to use 2 cups of milk instead of just 1 1/2 cups, but that was expected from other reviews.  Overall I will be making this again, and again.

I used ground sausage and added a cup more of milk, and my whole family loved it and asked to have it again.  Next time we might have it on biscuits.

Nice flavor, this actually had some flavor unlike some SOS recipes. I had to add another half cup of milk though as this was too thick. This makes a fast and easy dinner. We are going out of town and needed to use up the milk and bread and this did both. Thanks.

I condiser myself a connoiseur of creamed beef, chipped beef, etc.  The only recommendation I would add is a trick to not overdoing the flour amount is to add a half cup of milk once the burger has browned, bring it to a low boil and then add the flour, whisking in one tablespoon at a time.  This allows you to get the consistency right instead of back pedaling.  Add more milk and flour as desired but ut the milk in first.  Otherwise it can and more often than not will get lumpy.  Enjoy! Ah!, the smell of diesel fuel in the morning!

EXCELLENT!!!  And so very tasty!!  Although I was leery of using chicken bouillon, I am so glad I did, and followed the recipe exactly as written. This is, by far, the BEST recipe for SOS!!!  Wish my dad, who was a WWII Air Corp veteran, was still with us to taste it. (He used to mix the flour in before browning, and, although delicious, his was a little too greasy for my liking.)  This version allowed me to drain what little grease there was (I used ground round), and it still came out awesome!!!  My husband insisted on seconds!!!!  Thank you SO much for sharing!!

I just made this recipe for my ailing 94 year old father and he ate it.
He always talked about eating this in WWII and my mom used to make it frequently. He has not had it in years and I have been trying to cook things to entice him to eat.  This recipe did it and I served it over real mashed potatoes. The trick is definitely the grease.  I used a little more milk and a little more pepper.  Turned out great!

Delicious!  I used two cups of milk to get the creamy texture.  Second time I made it, I added a cup and a half cooked cubed Yukon potatoes, worchestire sauce and a can of peas and diced carrots.  Made a thick beefy stew.  One time I added an envelope of dry onion soup mix.  That added an awesome flavor.  Either way, it's a hit at my house and so versatile.

My dad was an Army man, but my mom never made this at home. When I found the recipe, I had to try it. After my family decided they liked it, I called my dad to tell him I made "Army special" for dinner. He knew it was SOS right away!  I am bringing him some tomorrow. 
BE SURE NOT TO ADD EXTRA SALT when making this. I used a spice blend that I use routinely, and forgot about the salt in that and the chicken bullion. I added more milk and cooked it a little longer to try to thin the saltiness, but it is still salty. We served it with biscuits, and my 15 year old football player ate 4 biscuits opened up with SOS on each side. Guess the extra salt is just replenishing his loss from workouts.  ;)
Next time we will try it with a hamburger and breakfast sausage mixture and serve it over hash brown patties as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for sharing!

This was just okay.  The flavor really wasn't there and it was so thick that it just sat so heavy on my stomach.  Also the pepper somehow over powered it.

This is a favorite dish from my childhood and a go to recipe after Easter to use up hardboiled eggs, which we chop up and serve with the dish. I followed the seasonings listed in this recipe for the meat mixture, but followed my own recipe for the sauce. It was a happy mix and very delicious. Even my two pickiest children liked it!! =D

Very yummy! Although the SOS I'm familiar with is more creamy then how this recipe turns out. I followed the recipe as stated but also added some garlic salt. Hubby also thought it would be good with mushrooms, but I liked it how it is. Will make again. Quick and easy and my family loved it!

Made this today and there is a tiny bit leftover, but not much! I omitted garlic and bouillon because that's how my mom always made it, and added a 1/2 cup more milk. Terrific over split-open biscuits!! YUM!!

After reading the reviews I made some changes. I added fresh mushrooms and one onion. I fried them with the hamburger. I did not use the onion powder. And I added one package of brown gravy which made it creamier. I used seasonings to taste. My wife loves this dish.

I made this tonight.  I did it exactly like the recipe said except I did use two cups of milk, which I thought made just the right consistency.  It was absolutely delicious!  Who would think something so simple could taste so good.  The blend of seasonings is perfect~ Can't wait to make it again!!

i only gave it 3 stars because i had to modify the recipe and i know the original way would have been better. i did not have milk so i used my back-up box of powdered milk. the gravy wasnt as good as i think it could have been. i addded onion and garlic to the beef. i also added some worcestershire sauce. there was still a little flavor lacking, so at the end, right before serving, i stirred in a few slices of cream cheese! it actually helped with the flavor and texture of the gravy. i will definitely make this again, but i will make sure i have milk the next time!

I have not actually used this recipe, but with the exception of the onion powder the ingredients are exactly the same as my version, but I cooke mine differently. I'm an army brat and have been eating this dish for 40 years. My kids eat it and always ask for it. We usually eat it for breakfast but sometimes have it for dinner.      Having made it for years I don't measure but I cook the ground beef adding salt and garlic powder or adobo seasoning, then drain it. I remove the beef from the pan and make a roux with flour and butter, stir in mik plus water or chicken broth. I add chicken boullion paste to the sauce, seasoning to taste, and then add the beef back to the sauce. Really good over buttered toast.

4 1/2 this was pretty great, I chose it as it seemed to have the most flavor of all the SOS recipes. I followed the ingredients and was very pleased, the flavors were yummers. I served it over toast, which was good. Next time, i will make it so there is more gravy and try it over noodles. I thought about changing the chicken bouillon for beef, but decided to try it as meant to be, and glad I did. Thank you for this.

I made this tonight, as written. I did add diced fresh onion, instead of onion powder. Delicious !!! My 9 year old gave it 25,000 stars ! He is my toughest critic.
Served over biscuits. You will find that you'll need to add more milk, not a big deal. As former military myself I must say 4.0 sir.

My husband was a military brat.  His Dad would make this for breakfast.  My husband said I "nailed it" when I made this for dinner one night.  I used extra lean meat but the next time I would use 80/20.  It does add to the flavor.

I added fresh mushrooms and some red pepper flakes. I had to use more milk cause it tasted to much like flour without the extra. Was good, but not sure I would make it again. Just not something I would want to eat on a regular basis.

I have made this so many times before.  The lady that told me how to make this called it hamburger gravy.  I guess there was more milk added to make it creamier.  But I have put it over rice, noodles, toast, biscuits etc. you get the point it is very versatile.  I have even used ground sausage and made it for breakfast over biscuits.  Very good.  Love this recipe it is the best way to make a white gravy when you are using sausage or hamburger.

Yummy!  I have made it twice and needed to double the amount of milk in the recipe.  The first time I made it, I served it over white rice.  The 2nd time, I made it with breakfast sausage and served it over biscuits.

Total comfort food...yummy.  I didn't think it was going to be thick enough but as it sat it got too thick.  So next time I will either serve it right away or add some more milk.  Served over whole wheat toast.

This was a very tasty, comforting dish! Like already mentioned by another, this is no cuisuine although it is a delic Dish! The only thing I changed when cooking this recipe was add the two things I Always am cooking with! I cooked the beef with minced galic, along with the powders and at the end while it smmered I added about 2 tabs of butter to give a little more oomph of flavor. My boyfriend made a mmmm mmmm mmmm but I don't think he enjoyed it as much as I did. The best part was it was a snap to put together and cook! But that's probably why this recipe is no cuisine!

Very well put together recipe,. You should edit the part where it say anything other than HAMBURGER...and chicken bullion...If you ain’t tried dried chipped beef “aka dried beef gravy”. Man, you ain’t tried nothin. Hamburger doesn’t add the salt and color required for some good ol fashion sos. Probably why the need for bullion cubes

I liked the simplicity of this recipe, and it was good. Kudos to John.  I made it per the directions. I think I will make some substitutes next time. I will add a half cup of beef stock while hamburger is cooking. It needed something to give it a kick so I will add more black pepper and some salt.

I made this, and it was delicious! I used Texas Toast, and browned the toast with butter in a skillet. I added extra water to make it a little more runny. I like to pour it over the toast, and run onto the plate.

Turned out fabulous as written. This has been a family staple since childhood, but I made it a little different, harder. We would brown the meat and then make gravy separate and then blend the meat into the gravy. This was so much faster and so much simpler and with fewer dishes to wash, which is a major plus. I always add onions, as I’m browning the meat. It also tastes fabulous and with fewer fat calories using ground turkey. I always make rice with it and mix it in with my SOS on my plate and spread the concoction over a couple slices of bread. I swirl ketchup on top

My husband, who was an Air Force brat and whose mother made SOS, liked it but found it drier than it should be. We agreed that was because I used 93% lean ground beef.  I'm going to make it again but will use 85% lean ground beef!

This is a simple no-fail recipe that the kids will love.  My 17-year-old son was especially fascinated by the dish's origins as an old Army recipe.  I made mine without the chicken bouillon, and it turned out great.

Love this!  Grew up with mom making this.  I now use ground turkey (agreed not as good but a tad healthier) but add beefy French onion soup mix - 1/2 a pack.  Also use beef bullion instead of chicken just to give it more of the beef flavor.  Just got to be careful on adding salt though due to soup mix.

Husband gave it a 10; didn’t have any chicken broth granules & used skim milk.  It’s a definite winner over toast on a comfort food night.

Tried this with ground pork, and it works great! We like ours a bit runnier to mix with rice so next time I'll add an extra cup of milk.

I cooked my ground beef with diced fresh onion instead of onion salt and minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also used toasted sourdough bread instead of regular white bread. I will definitely be cooking this again!

Way too thick.  1/2 cup of flour is too much for out taste.  I think half that much, or even less, would have been better.  Will try it again with much less flour.

Very good and simple.  I made it into a meal by adding an extra cup of milk to it, chopped onion and mushrooms, cubed up a tube of raw biscuits in the bottom of a 13x9 dish, topped with this prepared recipe, then added shredded cheese and cooked it in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 min.  I’ll be making it again.

The pic you see is before I cooked the milk too long. It was thick like glue. Perhaps I would have liked it more if it would have been gravy!. I felt this was very bland, so I added some Louisiana seasoning to it, and it made it tolerable. Not my favorite.

I followed the recipe to the letter. It got a little thicker  that I thought it would so I added 1/2 cup more milk and it was more to our liking. I served it over butter flavored biscuits. I will make it again and maybe use less flour or use 2 cups of milk instead of 1½ cups like the recipe calls for. It's a keeper. My wife and I both liked it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the original SOS was made with chipped beef.

It was very good served on toast topped with a chopped hard boiled egg. The next night I mixed in some sour cream and a can of mushroom soup and served it over noodles, like a quick hamburger stroganoff.

This was a little thick for us. I added a Worcestershire sauce. I would send it out a little more next time and maybe even used half pound of hamburger instead of a full.

I have been craving this for a long time! My grandma used to make it alot with chipped beef & I ate alot of it while in the Army. Only things I did differently was used 2 c of milk & more pepper (love pepper) & a dash or 2 of worcestershire sauce & my "shingles" were my homemade white bread toasted......Yum!!!! Definitely a keeper!

Good recipe.  Turned out very close to the SOS I used to get at my beloved, now-defunct diner.  Strange that the recipe doesn't mentioned salt, because mine needed some.  Also, I needed way more milk (about 2.5 cups) because it absorbed so much of the liquid that it was getting too stiff.

I was in the Military for 22 years, and I always looked forward to having this for breakfast. I've searched for the perfect recipe. And u just found it here. This is exactly how I remember it. I didn't have it with toast, instead I had it with a poached egg on a English muffin with some Canadian bacon. I guess it's eggs Benedict  with the SOS instead Hollandaise. However you have it, you will love it. I didn't change the recipe at all.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was great!  Poured it on a couple of pancakes and topped it with two over easy fried eggs. Just the way I used to get it at midnight chow in the USAF (circa 1957-59) Johnson Air Base, Japan.

I haven't had this since i was a kid...was good. didn't use the boullion though..too much salt so I salted as needed..used real onion and garlic chopped fine. Nothing fancy about it. that's why I only gave it 3 stars nothing bad about it either it is food and it was edible.

This is Outstanding! I liked the creamed beef in the Marines but I can tell you it wasn't at all like this. My son who is picky, asks me to make it quite often. I usually put it over hash browns but it is so good I would eat off the bottom of the trash can.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I usually make sausage gravy, but didn't have any sausage.  However, I had some leftover ground beef that I needed to use, so I tried this recipe.  It was very simple to make and very good!  I double the amount of flour and milk to make extra gravy so that we could use it on some potatoes.  I served the rest over biscuits.  It thickened nicely.

I did a little tweaking and added cream of mushroom soup to give it a little more gravy. This has become my daughter's new favorite dinner!

This was pretty good. Liked the seasonings, I also added 1/2 tsp. kosher salt. And I added another 1/2 cup of milk to make it a little thinner. The only problem I had with this was it being too greasy. I would definitely recommend using lean beef (mine was not lean). Or maybe draining the grease off and using 1/4 cup butter in place of the grease. Still a great, simple and inexpensive meal. We served it with mashed potatoes and toast. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this tasted great for such a simple recipe.  So quick and easy that it'll be an "I don't feel like cooking" staple from now on.  I ended up adding much more milk, as the consistency was too thick for my taste, but I also kept it on the heat longer than I needed to, waiting for my side dish to be ready.  I might play with draining the fat (at least partially) and adding in broth instead, even though it says not to, just to see how it turns out.

This is delicious! My whole family loves it, even my 8 year old daughter.  I had an uncle that used to cook this for us at his lake house, but now I have the recipe and can make it myself.

Hamburger Gravy, is what we call it. We have been making this for years with the only difference being using fresh chopped onion and canned Evaporated milk. We sometimes use lean meat and add drippings saved from a roast. The kids love it and their perfect meal is mashed potatoes topped with the hamburger gravy and canned Le seur peas.
