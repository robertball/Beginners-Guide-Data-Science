This was excellent! Rustic, Italian comfort food. I backed off the crushed red pepper, only using about 1 teaspoon and still got a nice little bite. I removed the skin from the chicken thighs which is what we prefer and I seasoned it with salt and pepper on each side while sauteing. Used 2 packages of thighs which gave me 8 pieces. Otherwise followed as written. You can sub any kind of pasta you've got in the pantry. Really good!

We really enjoyed this! I did add more garlic, we do love our garlic. Instead of red pepper flakes I used some cayenne pepper, didn't measure it just eyeballed it. Didn't want to chance my daughter getting one of the red peppers and refusing to eat anymore. I ended up using 8 thighs instead of the 6 and kept all the other ingredients in the same amount. Used penne pasta and served this with some crusty french bread. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding quite a bit more red wine.  WE didn't need to thicken the sauce as it was perfect as is.  We served it over linguine and enjoyed every bite!

Next time I would follow the advice to use boneless skinless chicken and cut it up into small pieces. The flavor was nice but it didn't  seep into the chicken so the meat what somewhat plain. I would try it again as I said the sauce part was good.

I made this last night for company. It was a hit and absolutely fabulous as written. I doubled the recipe and used boneless chicken thighs though. Breading the chicken and just browning it, putting it back in with the sauce to cook made it so tender it melted in your mouth. Oh...I also didn't have but half the mushrooms on hand but still was fabulous. If I'd had the extra mushrooms, I would've used them cause I love them. I prepped the veggies and put them in bowls prior to cooking because I had errands to run. It cut down on putting it all together at once. If it hadn't been my day off, I would've prepped the veggies in the a.m., and left the cooking for when I got home. Still needs about an hour + to cook it all. Worth the wait. I'm keeping this in my recipe box!!

I've made two versions of this dish both off this website and I prefer this recipe. The biggest difference in this recipe is coating the chicken in flour before frying, this really makes the entire meal taste better. Thank you for sharing!

This is the best Cacciatore we have ever had.  Since Pancetta is so expensive, I have substituted thick sliced bacon many times with no issue.  Otherwise, I have made this recipe as written and it is always delicious

My picky husband loved it! I used chicken broth instead of wine and fresh chopped tomatoes. I only subbed for lack of wine and canned in the cupboard!

Fantastic!  Made it for the wife and she loved it.  I used thin spaghetti.  Use whatever pasta you want.  The recipe calls for extra virgin olive oil which I'm not usually a fan of cooking with.  I prefer sauteing with regular olive oil and frying with light olive oil but I followed the directions regardless.  EVOO has a smoke count of 325 degrees F so don't turn the heat too high during the steps before adding the tomatoes.

One of the best recipes for this meal.  I added extra garlic. I cooked some thighs with the skins on and half with the skins off.  The ones with the skins on, the skins got soft and mushy after cooking it back in the sauce and the meat was not as flavorful.  The ones without the skins had amazing flavor.     The sauce was thick enough so I did not need to thicken it.

I didn't have fresh Basil and only half the mushrooms. I did thicken the sauce a little by making a roux by combining a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of the left over flour mixture that I added when it was nearly done. I used a corkscrew, or spiral, type of pasta. That's a personal choice as I like how that pasta holds onto sauces.

Very good flavor but just a bit too spicy for my taste.  I will make it again but I will definitely use less red pepper.

A-MA-ZING!
Finally found a cacciatore recipe I love, and it's easy to boot.  Made just as written (only exception omitted the green pepper - hate it).  I used more garlic - 6 cloves or so.  Do NOT skip the pancetta step.  The crushed red pepper/flour/seasonings mixture was sooooo good -- just the right amount of "zing".  The sauce was perfect -- makes a LOT, so I split it in half and used my immersion blender on half which I then coated the cooked rigatoni in (it sucked it all up).  Then I topped the chicken pieces and pasta with the un-blended other half on the serving platter.  Sooooo good.  My husband of 18 years gave it a "top 5 dinner of all time" rating -- that was HUGE.

This was the best recipe I've tried in a long time.  I followed everything the recipe that I didn't use the water or the cornstarch and it still thickened up perfectly.  I also didn't use pancetta, I used regular pork bacon instead and this was a huge hit with my family.

I thought this recipe was outstanding.  I altered the chicken used to suit my family.  I used 2 bone-in chicken breasts and 4 boneless skinless thighs.  I added the breasts, cooked for 25 minutes, then added the thighs and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  I disagree with previous reviewers....I think the pancetta in necessary for the flavor in this dish.  Bacon would alter the taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe, wanna give it 5 stars except that i used the full TBSP of red pepper flakes and it was too spicy for the kids. Also, I bought the pancetta just to try it. It is lovely, very delicate and delicious, but I think bacon would work well too, at less than half the price and much more availability. This also has relatively little salt but still very flavorful. It was so delicious, even with the full TBSP of red pepper! Tender, flavorful, wonderful dish.

This is a great go to dish for any hectic weeknight. Went from chopping ingredients to setting platter on the table in less than 90 minutes.  Made a few changes, the first was using a large electric skillet. Also chopped applewood smoked thick slab bacon in place of pancetta, and I used boneless, skinless thighs which I butterflied for even but quick cooking. Dredged thighs in flour seasoned as written, allowed to rest while I chopped mushrooms, then re-dredged before browning the thighs. Added 4 Tablespoons butter and when melted completely, deglazed the skillet a bit, added one pound of sliced white button mushrooms, and one pound of sliced brown button mushrooms. Saute over medium low heat, turning mushrooms over until completely cooked through. Then follow recipe as written. Our boys fought over the last piece of chicken and sauce! Not only quick (butterflying the boneless, skinless thighs helps a ton) but flavorful and filling. Keeping this recipe for busy nights and picky eaters.

My husband said this was one of the best chicken cacciatore dinners he has ever had.   Recommend this dish.... Easy and good.
