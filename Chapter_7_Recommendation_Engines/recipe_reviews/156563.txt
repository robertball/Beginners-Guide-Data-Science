I will definely be making this. I found a gold mine recipe on a Barley box that is similar to this. It has water and beef stock or cubes instead of the tomato juice but calls for 1/2 cup of barley. I had never used barley but it sure makes the soup filling.

Loved this simple soup! I also used V8 juice, and added a small can of green peas, plus a bay leaf. Adding a small can of creamed corn, near the end of cooking time, will give vegetable soup a silky texture. Just be careful not to leave it on the burner too long afterward without stirring, or it can scortch.

Good basic flavors.  I added more seasoning because it was a bit bland.  I added garlic, basil, thyme, and marjoram.

EAsy recipe, still recovering from a cold and had lots of veggies to use.  I also used a 46 oz jar of low sodium v8.  Added some italian seasonings, cayenne pepper (trying to kick this sore throat), and various veggies that included mushrooms, canned green beans, edamame, canned corn, carrots, onions, celery, zucchini and some red peppers.  I also had to thin it out a bit with a can of veggie broth.  YUM. It made a lot of soup, but thank goodness it's not too hot yet to still eat it.  FYI--cayenne pepper was only a pinch, it adds a kick to it but helps cures sore throats!

This is a great soup!  I usually make soups, eat them one day and then never touch the leftovers.  Not this one!  I loved it and ate it all.  It is easy to make and tastes great.

This is a great, easy soup. We try to eat healthy, so I substituted the ground beef with lean ground turkey. I followed the suggestions of others and used V8 instead of regular tomato juice. I also added some chopped fresh parsley, garlic, marjoram, celery salt, and basil. Delicious!!

This is very similar to a soup that I make. I use ground beef, various veggies and V8 juice rather than regular tomato juice. I've never added ginger, but sometimes add minced garlic. It's delicious and freezes well.

I really like this soup. I only had 30oz. tomato juice, so I used chicken broth to make up the difference. I also only used one big potatoe and that was plenty. I will be making this soup again.

As is, this recipe would have been horridly bland.  I started out with the original recipe, but I tend to taste as I go, and boy did this recipe need ALOT of help!  This sin't a bad place to start, but I highly recommend adding a lot more seasoning than this calls for.  I added garlic, ground red pepper, onion powder, a can of beef broth, italian seasoning, liquid smoke, a teaspoon of soy sauce, and worchestershire sauce.  I also added a can of mushrooms (undrained) and 1/2 cup of barley (uncooked) to the pot.  I let this simmer for close to three hours, watching it closely so it didn't scorch.  I had to keep tasting it as it cooked and adjusting the amount of salt and black pepper since the fresh veggies and barley do tend to absorb the flavor  The end product had amazing flavor, and was something that I would not be ashamed to server to guests with hot corn bread.  YUM!

Love this soup! 64oz low sodium V8, bag of frozen mixed veggies and a potato and you have an awesome soup.  Have made this over and over again and never get tired of it.

This was very good and tasty. I did make some changes. I used V8 juice instead of tomato, cream corn and regular corn, and I added 3 TBS. of butter for richness. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and about 3/4 cup of barley. If it's too thick just add some  more juice, broth, or tomato sauce. Very good recipe though!! Thanks!

This is the way my mother taught me to make Vegetable Beef soup while I was living at home years ago. I use frozen vegetables however, simply person choice (Don't like canned vegetables) I add chopped Celery, Frozen Lima Beans, minced garlic, a bay leaf and a can of chicken broth. Also, I add in Elbow Pasta or whatever pasta shape I have on hand, cooked separately and stir in last minute. A couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce is good too. I put everything in the crock pot on high for a few hours (No Worries About Scorching That Way) just til it's at a good simmer for a while. We serve ours with shredded cheddar cheese and crushed saltine crackers. Mmmmmmmm!

I found this while looking for a way to use up some tomato juice I had in the fridge.  This was super delicious and super easy to make.  My 12 year old son made this soup, with a little help from me.  Even my husband, who doesn't like tomato based things, liked it enough to have seconds.  My only modification was to add a can of chopped tomatoes because I didn't have a full 64 ounces of tomato juice.  We will make this often.

This is a great recipe! I used vegetable juice instead of tomato juice and made a couple other modifications to make it like my grandma's soup by adding a small amount of cabbage and celery.  Definitely adding this recipe into my rotation!

AWESOME! I made ten quarts of this for a scrapbooking party yesterday, and the ladies at it ALL.  I made a couple of small changes - I used V8 instead of tomatoe juice, added some celery, and it was too thick, so I thinned it out with some beef broth.  I also skipped the salt.

We made this recipe in my pre-k class for a unit on friendship. I called it friendship soup and each child brought in an ingredient. It was a cinch to make and very tasty. Out of the 11 kid only one would not try it. The 10 kids who did loved it with several asking for seconds. The only changes I made was I used V8 juice in place of the tomato and added to cans of vegetable broth. We did not season with salt, pepper and ginger as the V8 gave it a lot of flavor. I am making it tonight for my family.

This was a very good soup! My husband and I really enjoyed it but my kids (ages 5 and 8) wouldn't eat it. Not sure why. I don't usually make tomato based soups, but I'm glad I gave this a try. It's hearty and very flavorful. I made a few changes. I used V8 instead of tomato juice, as some other reviewers suggested. I also used fresh green beans, cut into small pieces, instead of canned and frozen corn instead of canned. Too make up for the lost liquid, I used one can of petite diced tomatoes with liquid and some chicken broth. I will make a couple changes next time I make this. I'll add some chopped zucchini just for more veggies and I'll cut down on the amount of V8 and cut it further with chicken broth. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  Very healthy!  I thought it could use about one more cup of tomato juice but all in all, very yummy.  I used v-8 and fresh green beans.  So easy to make too.

This soup has the best taste I think it's the ginger. So easy to make I will use it over and over. I love it.

This is definitely my kind of recipe. It couldn't be easier to make and it's delicious. I didn't change a thing but it's one of those recipes that is so adaptable that you could add other veggies, rice or macaroni. I love soup and I'll be making this one again and again. Thanks!

Very Easy Recipe added some noodles for my liking and it came out delicious! The only thing the carrots & potatoes took forever to cook next time I would cook those first before adding all the other stuff but overall very good

I made this soup for my son and myself because I was looking for a way to use some ground beef I had on hand. It's good if you're looking for a fairly quick, cheap soup. That being said, it is definitely not like my Grandma's soup. We use a beef roast, homemade stock, fresh and/or frozen veg and a can of diced tomatoes. To me the ground beef is bland and the soup is quite tomato-y, but my son didn't complain. I might make it again in a pinch, but I'd definitely use beef stock in place of some of the tomato.

I made a vegetarian version of this using Boca crumbles instead of beef.  I also substituted frozen vegetables for the canned.  Several other reviews mentioned that the soup was too thick, but the texture turned out very nice for me.  I will probably make this again but will see if I can find a way to take some of the acidic bite out of the tomato, which was just a bit strong for me.  All in all, quite a good soup and worth making again.

This was mostly helpful for the basic idea of using up leftover tomato juice as a soup base (found using the ingredient search function).  Worked out well.  Used a bag of frozen veg in lieu of canned.  Really thick - had to add auite a bit chicken broth to thin out.  Barley is great in this, too.

Hubby said this was the best vegetable soup he has tasted! I just substituted a bag of frozen soup veggies instead of fresh veggies and added some garlic powder for flavor. Served it along with cornbread. The ginger gave it a slightly different flavor than we had tasted before (although I think added more ginger than it called for. I don't measure spices, I just dump some in).

Excellent. The only change I made was to add celery and frozen zucchini and skip the corn. Will become a staple in our family menu.

Absolutely fabulous.  I too used V-8.  Easy, quick, delicious.  I made it on Saturday and just finished it on Monday, eating it for lunch and dinner.  Thanks for the recipe and the hints!

WOW!! What a YUMMY soup!!! While not strictly vegetarian, the ground beef gave it a lot of body. Instead of tomato juice, I used vegetable juice, which gave it a really good flavor. I also cut the kernels off two fresh ears of corn and sauteed the onions after browning the beef and before adding the other vegs. Also, halfway through simmering I added 2 cups of veggie broth because the soup was getting very thick. I omitted the salt and pepper too, and didn't miss it. All in all, easy and delicious . . . Thanks!

I used this easy and very yummy recipe when my mom was going through chemotherapy.  She LOVED IT, and my dad did too!  This is soooo good and soooo easy - I will be hard pressed to have canned tomato soup ever again!
