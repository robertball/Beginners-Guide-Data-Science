I have never used coconut sugar before, but I decided to pick some up at the store the other day. I found this recipe and I already had the remaining ingredients. This is incredible!!! It is so rich and delicious! My only complaint it only serves two people!
 I've made this so many times now and lately I've been making it in my microwave it takes even less time!!!
 I saw another review where someone added an egg yolk (God only knows why?!) You do not need to add the egg yolk to this pudding there is no need for it!

WOW!  This is an amazing recipe I worked off from for some spectacular chocolate pudding, very satisfying, and pretty healthy indeed.  Thanks for your submission.  I did a couple of changes to make it to my taste, one being quadrupled the recipe essentially to make enough to last for more than one day. (ha) I did add a dash of sea salt, and an egg yolk while stirring all other ingredients,  and in the end stirred in some coconut oil, about a tablespoon, and used about 2 teaspoons of pure bourbon vanilla.  Topped it with some sliced almonds and sprinkle of unsweetened shredded coconut.  This was SO rich and dark it was sensual and extremely satisfying.

I made this after having it suggested to me by the first reviewer. I have never tried coconut sugar. It isn't quite as sweet as regular sugar and either is this pudding. The pudding sort of reminds me of a dark chocolate version of chocolate pudding in flavor. What I really liked is how nicely it thickened up. I cooked it on medium stirring as it thickened with a whisk. Although, it made it non-dairy I topped the cooled down pudding with whipped cream. That added just enough sweetness. Also, upon reading the first review, I tripled the recipe. That amount made a typical recipe of chocolate pudding. ty

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I think it needs a pinch of salt, but otherwise, this is a great basic recipe! I have used different sweeteners, including stevia, and it works great. Thank you!

My husband said it was amazing.  It was very rich and decadent.  The only change I made was to use white sugar instead of coconut sugar.  The caloric value of both white and coconut sugar are the same and since we watch caloric intake and coconut sugar is not readily available I felt the substitution  would not significantly change the recipe.  I  did combine the dry ingredients in the saucepan first and whisked  the almond milk into them.  Added the vanilla after removing from heat.  Since this recipe is already relatively low calorie and healthy, I saw no reason to add egg, oil or coconut to it as one reviewer suggested.  It's delicious as is and those additions only add calories without really improving the recipe.  That said, everyone doesn't have the same tastes or dietary requirements.  This recipe, as is, is every bit as good as the high calorie, full fat varieties.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Update:  Added a pinch of cayenne with the vanilla and wow!  That little kick was well received and an unexpected but pleasant flavor.  (My "pinch" was a large one because I always double the recipe for 4 servings.  Adjust your "pinch" to your recipe and spice preference.)

I used stevia instead of sugar. It was just the bit of chocolate I wanted without all calories.

Seriously delicious! I did add a pinch of sea salt. It was amazing. I doubled the recipe and only kept 1/4 cup of the sugar (1 recipes worth)  as I love dark chocolate. I can’t get enough. Hubby said it’s great and was surprised to hear what was in it. Will be a regular at our house. Yum thank you x 10000000!

I made this but added a pinch of salt, which was much needed! I would make it again but I would definitely whisk the dry ingredients together beforehand and slowly incorporate it in the saucepan with the wet ingredients. It can be difficult working out the clumps of corn starch.

I really like this recipe. I added a pinch of cayenne and salt and that totally elevated it. But that's a taste thing. I also will probably shift the dry ingredients before adding the milk, as I had a hard time getting the lumps out. It cooked really quick on our gas stove, maybe only 3-5 minutes with continuous stirring. Love love love this, thank you and I now have an excellent pudding base to tweak tobm

Delicious rich pudding!  This is my first time to ever make any homemade pudding and not only is it delicious, but it was unbelievably easy. I had all of the ingredients on hand and whipped it up in less than 15 minutes. As I was stirring I thought I had done something wrong because it wasn’t thickening and then instantly it was perfectly smooth thick pudding. Thank you!

7.4.18  The serving size is small on this, so keep that in mind when preparing.  I used non-dairy coconut milk (what I had on hand), and it did not dominate over the chocolate.  Super easy to make, thickened up beautifully, and tasted decadent!

I made it as directed and it was just okay.  It had kind of a plastic taste to it. I wonder if other brands of coconut sugar might taste better because it had a strange flavor.  I’ll try some other pudding recipes instead.

The coconut sugar gives this a bit of a different taste but it was yummy, especially with strawberries. Will try with a bit more coco powder and vanilla next time.

I made this recipe.  It was really good if you like rich desserts.  This isn't super sweet as its more like special dark which is my favorite.  So it is on the bitter side but very rich in flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Only thing I changed was cooking it on a higher heat since it didn't thicken as quick as the recipe suggests.  And after I was done, I let it cool for about 20 mins and the put it in the fridge.
