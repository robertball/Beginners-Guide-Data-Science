I used half butter, half butter flavored shortening and because I did not have any walnuts, I omitted them. 1 1/3 cups chocolate chips wasn't near enough it seemed, I threw in the rest of the bag. I did not chill the dough, I baked it right out of the mixer bowl. My cookies were on the bigger size--I packed my cookie scoop quite full. Mine were done baking at 11 minutes. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for a couple minutes before pulling them off with the spatula and letting them cool on the kitchen counter. These turned out just as chocolate chip cookies should. No complaints.

This has to be the best ever chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever used. Have been using it for 3 years now. Simple, easy to follow recipe and the results are delicious.

Was unsure of them at first because I'm used to using butter in my cookies.  After making them I decided to use another recipe and ended up back at this one.  These are what a true chocolate chunk cookie should look like.  Hubby loved them too!

I'm glad I gave this one a try because I would have missed out if I didn't!  I had to make a couple substitutions because I didn't have walnuts on hand, but instead had almonds.  Because I put the almonds in, I threw about 1 1/2 tsp. orange extract into the batter along with the vanilla and a little additional salt (about 1/2 tsp) for some flavor.  Everyone loved them.  I think that because of the lack of flavor in the shortening, it allowed the orange to really come through and the texture of shortening cookies is completely different than those made with butter (I'd never made shortening cookies before).  These remind me more of a scone... sort of dry and crumbly, but so good with coffee or tea!

My family LOOOOOVED these cookies! The first time I baked them, I added a little bit of water because the dough seemed a little dry. They were a big hit! The second time, I used butter instead of shortening to try to avoid some of the trans fat... they were not nearly as good. This is a great recipe! Thanks Pam!

Comment from Japan. I' so happy to get such a really nice recipe !
It is very easy and good taste. I had cooked 3 times with this recipe already and I'm sure that I will cook it with the same recipe more.

They didn't turn out. The batter was all dry-it didn't look right. I tried two recipes, and neither of them worked.

THESE WERE AMAZING!!!! Instead of shortening, I used butter and halved the recipe. I omitted the walnuts, and instead put in dried cherries for my father who loves chocolate chip cherry cookies. These taste best when fresh and (slightly) warm from the oven. Overall, a fantastic recipe!

I like the recipe it did look a bit dry. So I added half a stick of butter to the recipe and it made it a whole bunch better.

These were, in fact, different from what I normally expect chocolate chip cookies to be.  I didn't think I' d like the shortening but it was fine.  Gave the cookies more of a smooth taste.  I still prefer butter in mine but these are an easier way to make them with no beating of the butter.

These cookies turned out excellent! I used a bit less of the white sugar and baked them for 10 minutes for the altitude and they are delicious.
