I used twice the tomatoes (and garlic!) and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also threw in some onions and mushrooms with the bell peppers.  I had some fresh thyme and oregano which I cooked with the sauce and then put the rest of the spices (dried) to cook with the chicken so it would have more flavor.  There was so much sauce, which is good because it is delicious.  I served this with fresh garlic & parsley linguine noodles.  I also left out the butter & cheese to reduce calories and I swear it wasn't missing a thing.  Oh and I cooked the chicken at the same time as the sauce (in a separate pan) to save time.  I have some cleaning to do but it was worth it.

Great recipe!  I made a few ingredient changes based on what I had on hand at the time, and I added the basil, rosemary, thyme, and garlic powder both to the tomato mixture while it was cooking and to the chicken pieces before cooking them.  It turned out well seasoned and quite tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is the best I've tried so far from this site. Everything blended well and I love the fact that the sauce was light enough for  me and my husband. You don't have to stress about the ingredients. Most of them are stuff that you already have in your kitchen cabinet. I didn't have yellow peppers and it still came out great. I might add that if you need some more sauce, consider adding another can of tomatoes. Also , consider seasoning the chicken breast well enough to make it more flavorful.Otherwise,I love this recipe and it's a keeper.

After one substitution and a streamlining of cooking direction steps, my family gives this five stars!  I substituted a can of Italian Stewed Tomatoes for the diced tomatoes w/green chile peppers.  To streamline the process while giving the chicken more flavor AND cut some of the fat, I sauteed the chicken chunks with the peppers and fresh garlic in 2 T olive & 2 T butter.  *I still used the garlic powder as well during this process to ensure there was enough seasoning.  Once the chicken was cooked through and the peppers tender, I added the two cans of tomatoes and the herbs (heaping 1/2 tsp of each of the three herbs) and let the mixture simmer while I boiled the water and cooked the pasta.  This process seemed to have eliminated the comments of bland-tasting chicken and gave a more flavorful sauce.  Very tasty, not too heavy and delicious leftover!

Surprisingly AWESOME! I did add a couple TBLS of minced onion when sauting the peppers and added the dry herbs when I added the tomatoes so that they could simmer/add flavor to the "sauce" instead of adding them at the end. My daughter thought it was a tad too spicy but she still ate every bite from her bowl. My boyfriend thought this was amazing. Although it takes up a couple pans, what are dishwashers for? Thanks so much Joy - I'll make this again!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I cooked it for a dinner party and it was a hit.  I used fresh herbs and used a little more than what the recipe called for.  Wonderful!

Great, healthy recipe. The only problem with the recipe as it is written is that it needs more veggies! (like zucchini, broccoli, and a little bit of onion). I suggest using fresh basil, too. 

Some other recommendations: Instead of chicken (and the butter mixture) I used andouille chicken sausage (that I cooked prior).  Add some chili paste or red pepper flakes for a kick.

This was an excellent dish.  I made a few changes, I only use 1/2 of each of the peppers and I added, 1 bunch of broccoli, 1/4 piece of squash, and 1/4 piece of zucchini all sliced thin.  I added the spices into the tomato mixture so it can cook altogether for the ten minutes.  I will make this again.

This was a fun and easy way to have this favorite... I added a golden bell pepper, half a package of baby-Bella sliced mushrooms, and half of a chopped onion. Quite a bit more garlic too! But that's just because I'm addicted to garlic I think! Next time I will not add all of the juice from the canned tomato's,  as it's too much liquid,  which I in turn simmered longer to cook off, causing all of the veggie's to get "Minnesota-mushy".  Tasted great though!!

The tomatoes with chilies added a really nice kick in this recipe!  I did make some changes which I think really enhanced the recipe.  I put the listed herbs into the sauce as it was cooking so that the flavors of the dried herbs could be released.  Also, I sprinkled additional of all the herbs listed (plus some coarse salt and pepper) on the chicken before cooking as a crust to seal in the moisture.  The chicken came out so tender and flavorful!  Finally, I would recommend cutting back the oil and butter used for frying the chicken to 1 tbsp. of each.  I had way too much leftover after cooking.

My husband loved this (and he isn't particularly fond of pasta) because he thought it tasted somewhat similar to fajitas (I'm guessing because of the peppers).

My food critics both went back for seconds on this one!  I added carrots & onions and cooked the chicken in the sauce instead of using the extra oil and butter.  Also used italian tomatoes instead of the green chili style as we've had lots of spicy food lately and needed a break!  I'm looking forward to trying it with spice another time though.  Love, love, love it!  Thanks!!!  Update - just had leftovers for dinner.

This was AWESOME!!!  I used penne instead and everyone in the house loved it.  I will add mushrooms and brocolli and leave out the chicken next time, just to mix it up.  Yummy!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.  MADE IT FOR MY HUSBAND, HE HAD BEEN BEGGING ME TO MAKE CHICKEN PRIMAVERA.  ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT THE CHICKEN PRIMAVERA HE HAS EATEN BEFORE BUT HE STILL LOVED IT.  SERVED IT WITH TOASTED BREAD ON THE SIDE.  WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.

Fabulous!! It made sense to season during the cooking process, so I combined all the dry spices into a little bowl and sprinkled half into the sauce while it cooked and the other half over the chicken as it cooked. I also added fresh onion to the peppers because we love onion. We loved the flavors, and the green chiles gave it just the right amount of kick! We'll definitely make this again~

Great recipe - if you use whole wheat spaghetti, the Weight Watchers points per serving are only 4!  I also used all olive oil (no butter) to cook the chicken and I put the spices on the chicken as I cooked it.

I thought this recipe was excellent, as did my husband.  I plan on making it again and having friends over, one of whom is a vegetarian.  My husband and I did not have this with chicken, but I can imagine that chicken would blend nicely with the sauce.  I did make some changes to make the meal more filling since we weren't having the chicken.  I used whole wheat wide egg noodles (no yolks, of course!) and while the noodles were cooking, I added about 4 cups of chopped broccoli and 2 cups of chopped green beans to the pasta water.  I put the broccoli in about 3 minutes before the pasta was done and the green beans 1 minute after that.  It made a very tasty vegetable-heavy main course!

This was one of the first recipes I made off of this website. It's a nice, light, tasty meal. For an extra flavor kick, make the same amount of veggies/chicken/sauce, but half the amount of pasta (I sometimes found too many bites with a lot of pasta and not much else.)

Wonderful recipe! Like some others, I made a few changes. First, I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with the spices, then I added the peppers and an onion and cooked until they were soft. Then I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chiles, and 1 can diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, and simmered for a few minutes. Served over linguine and with garlic bread on the side. It was a hit with the whole family! I will definately make this recipe again :)

Loved it, thank you!!! My husband was diagnosed recently with type 2 diabetes, and finding tasty dishes my meat and potatoes man will eat (and like) has been a challenge. This recipe (with whole wheat pasta) was a healthy delicious dish that I will definitely put on our rotation. I was pressed for time so I used a bag of frozen pepper stir fry mix, it worked well. I plan to try it with fresh peppers next time to compare. Thank you!!!

Great recipe! What a delicious way to eat your fresh veggies.  This dish was appealing to the eyes with all of the beautiful colors as well as flavorful.  I made a few slight changes - added a small sliced onion, one small can of tomato sauce and some italian seasong.  I ommitted the oil and just used butter to sauté the chicken, as well as added a little salt, pepper and italian seasonings.  Served over penne rigate.  Mmmm....left overs tomorrow!

My biggest complaint is the chicken had no taste.  The primavera sauce was ok but really reminded me of a cattiatore sauce (tomato sourness).  If I tried this recipe again, I'd saute the chicken in the sauce & not do them seperately.

Wonderful flavor!  I used stewed tomatoes instead of tomatoes.  I won't use the tomatoes with chili's again - just too spicy for this dish.  At the end of the sauce, before I added the chicken, I added 1/2 c good Cabernet Savignon - the same one I served with the dish.  This really deepened the flavors.  I had a rotisserie chicken so I boned it and used that.  I a

Delicious! My family loved it. I use linguine instead of angel hair and found the sauces juice was mostly on the bottom, but it was still amazing! Also added a dash of sugar to the sauce to offset some of the spice.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe but decided to try it anyway. I seasoned my chicken with lemon pepper, garlic powder and lawry's seasoning salt.This really made a difference. The sauce was watery so I added a small can of tomato sauce to thicken it. It's a keeper.

The picture doesnt do this recipe justice. I thought it was an excellent dish with good color and flavor. I added and a little onion which i thought went well with it. I used just the tomatoes with green chiles which gave it a little kick. Very good dish and i will make it again.

This is an excellent recipe! It reminds me of very traditional Italian food, which is good! This recipe is also fun to cook on the grill: I grilled the chicken, bell peppers, and also some onions and mushrooms and it really adds great flavor on top of the great tomato sauce! I also agree that the herbs should be simmered with the tomato sauce instead of sprinkled on top.

Awesome!!! I've been making this one now for awhile. It's in our regular rotation and everyone loves it! I don't find it at all spicy but I suppose if you do just use another can of regular diced tomatoes. Personally I love this just as much the second day if there even are any leftovers!

Instead of cooking the peppers separate in olive oil, I cooked them with the chicken once it was cooked and not raw.  Also I used a 3 pepper blend for a short cut. It turned out great!

Great! I used ingredients on hand, so all green bell no red or yellow, and for the tomatoes I used canned stewed tomatoes, one can was chili seasoning (not green chile), and cooked in the spices rather than putting them all in at the end. Cooking the spices made the rosemary a little strong and the basil a little weak.

Very good!! Made a few changes because of not having everything that was listed, but it turned out awesome! My husband & daughter loved it!
I used store-bought rotisserie chicken & julienned carrots, along with the red & green peppers. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes & served over linguini. 
I will definetly make this again...and again!!
Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good! Not extremely flavorful and a little too oily for my taste, but not a bad recipe at all. I would add more garlic and maybe a little bit of tomato paste.

This is an excellent and very nutritious dish!  My husband and 1.5 year old loved it, which is saying a lot for my toddler.
Instead of using butter for frying the chicken I used olive oil.

We added about a teaspoon and a half of sugar to offset the acidity of the can of diced tomatoes.  We also added a can of chopped black olives and sprinkled feta cheese on top.  This was a delicious dish.

Delicious!! I used the milder version of tomatoes with peppers, which was spicy enough for us. Also, to make it lower in fat, I used a little less olive oil, grilled chicken breasts that I had in the freezer, and just a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on each individual serving.

We liked this recipe; however, we like more sauce in our pasta.  Next time, I will add some tomato sauce when adding the diced tomatoes.  I seasoned the chicken with a generous amt of chicken seasoning b/c of other ratings.  Even though there was not enough sauce, it still tasted so good and gave off a very pleasing aroma.

This isn't bad if you like the really fresh, veggie tasting pasta sauce.  I did have to add salt and pepper, and I also added some onions when I was sauteing the peppers.

This turned out really good, I did add two small cans of tomato sauce with herbs because we like more sauce with our noodles.  We also used whole wheat spagetti since we do not care for angel haired pasta.

I made this dish for my family and they all raved about it!  It was simple and fast and delicious, and pretty healthy!  Next time though, I would marinate the chicken a little bit with salt and pepper just to get some flavor in them.  I served this with home-baked Italian bread with butter and garlic.  Yummy!

Very good and colorful.  For some reason I was expecting something a little more spaghetti-ish.  This recipe is more of a slightly spicy-veggie 'n chicken dish.  Although no one else liked it, I really did.  Will be making again with plenty of cheesey breadsticks for the pickier eaters!

This was ok-- my boyfriend and I felt it was a little bit bland - we felt like it needed more of a sauce.

Quite tasty but be warned that the tomatoes with chilies make it very spicy!
