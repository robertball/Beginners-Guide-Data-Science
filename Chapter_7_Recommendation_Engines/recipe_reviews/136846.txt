I am from northern sumatra, indonesia which is where this recipe comes from. I have done this recipe  
several times in the past, using indonesian recipe book. I think what is missing here are some ingredients:
1. coriander powder
2. turmeric leaves (hard to get outside indonesia)
3. black peppercorn
Also, the authentic preparation is much longer. More like 6-8 hours. The minangkabau rendang (minangkabau is the region in sumatra where this dish come from) tends to be dry, with all the liquid evaporated in the slow cooking. The meat is very dark, almost black. To achieve this dark color, put the rendang in oven at 220F for 1/2hour.

Amazing dish! I had a similar recipe and I combined two recipes to make this. I didn`t find banana peppers, so I used 3 red pepper and I used only 2 1/2 cans coconut milk, I think, it was enough, because the sauce wasn`t very thick. I put the half of the paste into a pan and added the coconut milk, lemon grass and lime leaves, boiled for about 20 min., then added the meat mixture with the other half of the paste. Overall, this is a great dish, my family was impressed, thanks.

This recipe was far too salty - it was over powering. I have to imagine that it is intended to be 2 teaspoons of salt, not 2 tablespoons. I've had Beef Rendang at several Indonesian restaurants and it's never tasted like this.

My dinner guests thought the meal was amazing, the beef cut with a fork and the flavor was wonderful.  Had to print out the recipe for them all. I used the lemongrass in the tube and pieces of lime peel instead of limes leaves. Also I used ginger root instead of galangal.

I use red bell peppers instead of banana pepper and it still came out pretty good. It's nothing close to real rendang but is not bad either.

I love a good beef rendang, but unfortunately, this dish was way too salty for me. I also found it too heavy on the lemongrass and lime leaves--and not spicy-hot enough. Sorry for leaving a bad review, but I just thought you should know....
