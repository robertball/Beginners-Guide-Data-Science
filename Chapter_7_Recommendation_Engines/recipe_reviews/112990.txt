This was very good, and beautiful, I wish that I had a pic to show, but we devoured them too fast!lol, I followed the recipe to the t, except I only used one of the TBS of orange juice, since I didnt want it to take away from the pumpkin taste. But it was delicous. thx

Reduced servings to 2 which may have caused a problem with my results.  Used non-fat cream cheese and think it was the big problem as it did not solidify with the marshmallow fluff upon refrigeration.  Also, I don't think the orange concentrate is needed or at least reduce the amount to half.  If i did it again, i would add a little brown sugar to the pumpkin instead of the maple syrup.

Excellent recipe.  I used 4 white wine glasses to hold the parfaits and ran out of the cream cheese filling, so I recommend doubling that portion depending on the size of your dessert cups.  Very easy, tasty, and festive.

I layered them in reverse to the instructions, but I wanted the white layer on the top to contrast with the gingersnap crumbs and pecan.  As another reviewer commented, you will have more of the pumpkin mixture than the marshmallow creme mixture, so keep that in mind when layering, as they are not equal in volume.  These were good, but honestly, I expected more.  The pumpkin layer in particular just tasted like a soft  pumpkin pie filling to me; I could not taste the OJ concentrate in either layer.  In spite of that, they were eaten, enjoyed, the presentation is nice, and they are easy to prepare.  So considering all that, the recipe at least deserves 4 stars.

Although beautiful I wasn't impressed by the taste. I followed the recipe exactly and it was definitely not sweet enough. Tasted nothing like pumpkin pie. I won't be making this again.
