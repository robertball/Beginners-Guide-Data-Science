Sorry, this was not our fave.Lemon was the only flavour that came through here. Served over cauliflower rice. Sriracha saved it a bit. Sorry it didn't work out for us but glad we tried it. Thanks Chris Denzer.

Modifications.... I made everything according to the directions, BUT,  I added lightly steamed BROCCOLI florets to the sauce and finished cooking according to the recipe. Then, I separately saut√©ed 6 oz fresh SPINACH with 3 cloves minced fresh GARLIC in 1 Tbsp GHEE (or butter) and 1/4 tsp salt for 3 mins. Finally, I served the shrimp dish over top of the spinach base. This dish was spectacular! A shrimp, lemon, turmeric, garlic, and spinach sensation!

Alright so several things are going on with this recipe that will lead to trouble.      

First of all, I'm assuming "spicy" was meant in the hot pepper sense as turmeric is a very mild spice (in terms of heat).     

Second, the recipe drowns everything in lemon. In fact, there is far too much liquid here for a stir fry. If "boil" appears in your instructions then you aren't stir-frying, you're boiling.     

Third, that time estimate for the shrimp is way off. You certainly want to cook until opaque, but that should take only 3 to 5 minutes.     

Here's my revision, (I left out new vegetables, but this recipe badly needs them. Broccoli, snow peas, cauliflower, string beans, or even a fruit like bell peppers would make great additions. I would also recommend serving this over rice or noodles)          

Juice and zest of half a lemon, separated     
1 Tbsp soy sauce or tamari (similar taste, gluten free if that matters)     
1 Tbsp oyster sauce     
1 onion coarsely chopped     
3-5 cloves of garlic, minced    
1 Tbsp grated ginger     
1 tsp ground turmeric    
1 tsp cayenne     
1/2 tsp salt     
2 tsp cumin seeds     
1 lb of shrimp (size determines cook time)     
1 Tbsp coconut, sesame, or peanut oil     
Pepper flakes to taste     
     
Mix lemon juice, soy sauce, oyster sauce, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, and salt then add to a plastic bag or bowl with the shrimp, shake or mix them together, and set aside in the fridge if made more than 15 minutes ahead.

I really liked the flavor of the sauce.  However, I have never cooked with raw shrimp before and managed to overcook them.  They were not in more than 5 minutes (recipe says 5-10) and they were overdone.  I would also pre-cook the onions as they are still very crunchy when all is said and done.  I did not have a lemon to zest, so I omitted that and I substituted ground ginger instead of fresh, grated ginger since that was what I had on hand.  I made this with a garlic spinach recipe I found.  I was going to serve it over brown rice, but that didn't happen.  My daughter (5) liked it.  My 2 year old son, not so much.
