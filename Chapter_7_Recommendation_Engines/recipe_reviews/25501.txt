This spread is AWESOME!  It has been, by far, the easiest and most delicious recipe I've ever made!!  It was a HUGE hit at our Christmas party.  I only rate it low on Kid Friendly because kids can be picky about olives - I don't know for sure!

Excellent and unique appetizer.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and served it with small crusty french bread slices.  Everyone loved it.  The recipe for 40 servings is too large for all the ingredients to fit into a food processor at the same time.  I will use this recipe anytime I have the chance.

I added about 10 green olives instead of the salt and skipped the sour cream.  We loved this - and so did everyone at the party we took it to.  Thanks!

I've made this same recipe for the past 4 years and regardless of the event it is a real hit.  The combination of black olives, thyme, and walnuts creates a uniqe flavor that is unlike anything else your guests will have ever had!

This looked TERRIBLE!!  It was gray and unappetizing.  I felt embarrassed to serve it...but my friend talked me into putting it on the table and NO ONE TOUCHED it at my party.  And it didn't taste good enough to justify how disgusting it looked.

I made this without the walnuts and spread it on a roast beef sandwich.  I chopped the olives and then stirred in the other ingredients by hand for a more chunky spread.

Pretty good, went over well at a party.  Definitely best with toasted bagel/baguette pieces.

Quick and easy, everyone liked it.  Will definitely do it again perhaps with a touch of anchovy essence.

I was looking for a new appetizer to serve recently and ran across this recipe. Without trying it beforehand I got the ingredients, made it, and served it. I trusted the reviews based on the number of 4-5 stars. I made no substitutions and followed the recipe completely. Well, I really didnâ€™t like it and neither did my guests. Luckily we had plenty of other food. My fault for not trying first, lesson learned.

Don't use the black olives, they make the dip look awful! I used green olives and turned out much better.  This one's a keeper.
