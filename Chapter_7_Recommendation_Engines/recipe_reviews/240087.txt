I added an additional can of cannellini beans because I really think this recipe needs more beans. The only other change I will make the next time I make this is that I will drain and rinse the black beans but keep the liquid from the tomatoes and one of the cans of cannellini beans. I ended up adding more chicken broth than the recipe called for and would have preferred the thickness of the bean liquid instead. Everyone has their own preferred thickness when it comes to chili though so use your own judgement there. This was super simple with no fuss and you really can't go wrong with this recipe.

this is pretty much my usual chicken/turkey/ground beef quick chili - there are some things I do different, I like a thicker base, so I process a mix of  cannelli, northern white, black beans into paste and add it to the broth. I also dont add sour cream to the pot, I dollop on top when the chili is in it's bowl :) The thing with Chili though - is you have to make it to suit your tastes.  My measurements for spices (usually by eye because it just works for me) are much different because I know my family's tastes... so look at your spices and decide to add or omit, ramp the amounts up or tone them down.  I'd try this on the stove first with leftover cooked chicken to get your spices and seasonings they way you want them to taste - and you can taste test as you cook to get them just right.  This way you'll know what you like when you use the slow cooker method. Finally, if you use the slow cooker and canned beans, the slow cooker can make things a bit mushy, if you want firmer beans, add them later..... This recipe is a great guide to YOUR best chili. A Great Easy recipe! thanks for posting!

The taste was fine however next time I will add an extra can of beans and reduce the amount of chicken broth.  I also will not add the sour cream until the end, as it curdles when you add it at the beginning,

Great slow cooker recipe! I used chicken strips and added a can of Blackeye Peas to add some southern flare. Also, put chicken in crockpot first, then add the spices and stir to season the chicken! I also added a little poultry seasoning, maybe 1/2 teaspoon. Then add the tomatoes, beans and liquid broth on top and stir them, keeping chicken near the bottom. In 6-7hrs the chicken will virtually shred itself! Enjoy!!

This was tasty and easy to make.  I had a little extra black beans in mine, as I had some I wanted to use up.  As per the Cook's Notes, I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked out well.

Very bland, I added An extra can of kidney beans, a can of rotel tomatoes and one extra chicken breast. I thought I added enough spice, but I guess not. Once you added all the chilli fixings sour cream, cheese and chips it was okay, but if I make it again I may use a chilli seasoning mix or something. Easy Weeknight dinner though

We did this using ground chicken which I browned first before continuing with the recipe. I also used an extra can of cannellini beans. We enjoyed it.

I made it according to the recipe.  It was very bland so part way through I added a lot more spices. It may have been because I used more chicken than it called for. Then it was very tasty. If I make it again, I don't think I will drain the beans or tomatoes.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I did tweak it for our preferences by adding another can of untrained white beans, a can of Rotel and two ears of corn. Yummy!

Wow, I thought this was delicious!  Minor changes - I used Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes.  I also didn't drain the white kidney beans.  Upped chili powder to 2 Tbsp and cumin and paprika to 1 tsp.  I used a generous sprinkle of hot sauce and pepper, and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  This wasn't spicy, which was fine with me.  Topped with mozzarella cheese, this had a rich, creamy taste that I loved!

I used about 1/4 teaspoon chili powder and doubled all the other spices (as someone else suggested). It came out great. I'm not a huge fan of chili, but this was amazing. For my personal preferences, I sauteed the onion before putting it in the crockpot and used buillion with water instead of broth.

It's really good but I found it to be salty. No explanation why.  I use a low sodium broth and tomatoes. I am definitely going to make it again as it is so easy.

I will omit the garlic powder and just add more garlic. Also perhaps caramelize the onions and keep them in bigger pieces.

Delicious! I added twice the beans as the recipe called for. Any beans really, northern, kidney, black, pinto, etc. I also added a can of drained corn. My first trial with this recipe turned out amazing. I didn't have any chicken breasts so I used duck breasts, yum. The second time i made this chili I used goose breasts. Everyone at the party loved it.

Very easy, a new family favorite.  I sprinkled it with fresh cilantro, shredded cheese, and a bit of lime juice when serving which was good - - but it's delicious on its own.  All three kids   and my husband love this chili.  Thank you for the recipe!

It was amazing and so easy to put together. Followed recipe for most part except I used only black beans, fresh jalapeño and longhorn peppers and Rotel diced tomatoes with jalapeños. Obviously we like heat but I found it gave just the right amount of heat and not overwhelming.   Perfect dish for a cold winter night.

This is a pretty yummy recipe and only 1 WW point with some modifications.  I left off the veg oil, not really necessary, and left off the sour cream, don't really like it anyway. 
Will definitely make this again.

I needed a quick, throw it together, slow cooker recipe today and came up with this gem. Every loved it, but I thought it was missing something. I noticed my boys adding salt, but I thought it was plenty salty and then it hit me... it needs acid! I grabbed a bottle of lime juice from the fridge and added a few drops to what remained in my bowl. BINGO! 

Everyone tried adding lime juice and agreed, it was even better. 

Of course, fresh lime juice would have been ideal, but I made do with what I had.

This is truly the easiest recipe to follow.  The only thing I did was add some white pepper.  I always do that because it tends to bring out the flavors of the other spices.  But it was easy and delicious.  I will definitely make this again, and I recommmend you give it a try.  I know the timing is kinda off, because if you're a working mom or dad, you'd have to start this a noontime for it to be done at six.  It doesn't matter.  Leave it in longer.  The only thing that will happen is the flavors will meld together better.  I usually don't rinse my beans or my tomatoes, but I followed the recipe to a tee and did exactly that.  It turned out great!

One of my all time favourites.  Right ingredients, in right proportions.

This is a very good recipe...however I made a few adjustments....I doubled the amount of all the spices-because I like it HOT ??....I also used a can of chili-seasoned diced tomatoes-which I didn't drain...I didn't mix the sour cream in either-I feel it would be better on the side, or omitted altogether.

Great idea just not executed right. Overall the recipe was pretty good, just didn't have nearly enough flavor for my liking. And don't add sour cream until the end, after it's done cooking, otherwise it curdles.

Good recipe ... I like more "kick" but likely good for most tastes. Will make again.

This is very good and easy. The only negative I have is it was a little bland- I would double all the spices next time I make it. Might try half and half instead of sour cream too.

I loved this recipe, so simple and tasty great for a Fall/Winter meal! Only change I would make is adding a little more of a spicy kick to it, but that's just personal preference. It mentions in the recipe to add as much chili to your liking I just didn't' want to over do it and end up with something I didn't like. The flavors were great though! Will definitely save this one. :)

Added a bit of green chili sauce and more water.  Great flavor and very tender juicy chicken.  Good over all recipe, but not a must make again.

I loved all the previous reviews and used more beans and spices. My hubby loves spice so I put in Sriracha Hot chili Sauce to add a very wonderful Kick. Will absolutely make this again.

This was extremely bland. It needed salt and a lot more spice. I put it over rice because there was so much liquid. I'll try it again another time, though.

I substituted ground pheasant for the chicken and the plain Greek yogurt for the air cream.  I also used 1TBS Valentina hot sauce.  Next time will use 1Cup of chicken broth not a fan of soupy chili.

I find reducing the broth by half a cup very effective. I also throw in some potatoes. I doubled the spices and it makes it less bland.

4/27/16:  Made with Mo.  Used ground turkey instead of chicken and pinto beans instead of black. Also, put in a whole onion and added squash and zucchini that we sauted in alvocado oil and seasoned.

My husband really liked this. I used chicken already cooked and I put it all in the crockpot at the same time all together for six hours. I didn't have to take the chicken out to shred it, it shredded easily inside the crockpot. I had to use kidney beans instead of cannellini beans, but I don't think it mattered.

Made as directed but used hot paprika and added an extra teaspoon of chilli. Also doubled the chicken.  Once cooked it needed more vegetables for our taste, so added can of drained mushrooms, can of drained corn, 2 green peppers and thickened it with cornstarch.  It was much better the second day.  Overall we liked it, but I would make it a day ahead of serving next time and would reduce the liquid by using chicken boullion paste/ cubes for the flavour, but less water.  Thanks for a new taste treat.

I used the 3 hour high cooking time.  The broth is too thin.  I read the other reviews and I would add more beans next time.  Flavor is ok.

So easy and so good!  I have to admit that this is more like soup than what I think of as chili, but my husband absolutely loved it!  By way of disclosure, I didn't drain the tomatoes or rinse the beans and used a whole can of chicken broth.  Oh yes, I also didn't have white beans so used the pinto beans.  Delicious anyway!!

I included the liquid in the cans (the goo is actually from the beans themselves, and those I used had zero additives). I added an additional can of beans, so reduced the broth. I also used fresh garlic and some celery and  cilantro. Delicious and so easy.

Modifications: Omit diced tomatoes & double chicken broth. 
Add fresh cilantro near end, but not sour cream. Served with toppings: tortilla chips, sour cream, scallions, black olives, cheese & tomatoes. Everyone LOVED it!!!

This was very good!! Very easy to prepare, cooked in 3 hours on high in my Aroma rice cooker (I would assume the same performance from a regular slow cooker). Made 4 generous (truck driver-sized) servings.
