These are really nice and creamy.  I'm not a baker so I failed miserably the first try.  Do not blend at high speed or the cream will turn into butter!

Quick, easy, and fantastic. All reviews are subjective as individuals have different preferences and so forth, but I found this creamy and delicious. My daughter loves them. If you like a stronger hazelnut flavor, then add more Nutella, if not, add less. Quite simple. Great recipe! Thank you for sharing.

Great creamy texture. Super easy to make. I used 1% milk & it still turned out great!  My 4 kids all want me to make these again!

I was expecting an ice cream like texture, but was a little disappointed. They were more like Popsicles, but creamier. Still pretty good though. Will make it again soon.

I took one lick and yelled, "Oh my gosh!" They are SO yummy!! I too only used 1% milk and they were still super creamy. I think Nutella and whipped cream are a perfect combo, will definitely be making these again.
