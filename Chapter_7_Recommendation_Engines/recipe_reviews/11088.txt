Light, crispy and simple. These go great with a cup of tea. I pulsed the coconut in my food processor. Made for a better texture. Thanks Nan.

Wow.  I LOVE this dough.  It's easy to work with, it shapes nicely, and you can vary it to no end.  I never had a problem with it not being coconutty enough, but I do toast my coconut first.  Recent variation:  subbed 1/4 c cocoa powder for 1/4 c of the flour and omitted coconut (and coconut extract).  Added crushed chocolate covered espresso beans.  My husband ate the whole batch in two days.  Thanks, Nan!

I loved these cookies. I had to make something with a coconut theme and they did great. To add a little flavor to the mixture I added crushed macadamia nuts and when they were out of the oven I sprinkled more coconut on top. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these with my 4 year old son yesterday and they turned out fantastic! I planned to save them for Christmas, but my son ate one half, and my husband ate the rother half - I only tasted one cookie... We did make an alteration, though, I used brown sugar (half brown, half white). We also coated the cookies in dark chocolate and sprinkled some coconut on top - my son loved doing that! I'll be making another batch when son's in kindergarten and husband at work, so that I can hide the cookies and save them for Christmas :)

was looking for something more crispy but these still turned out pretty well... i made 4 logs and froze them, and it was such a breeze to make them when i'm craving for a little treat... just slice and bake for 5 min in my toaster oven.  it's great because i can bake as much or as little as i want, and they're usually gone before the end of the day.

I reduced the oven temp to 350 after my first batch darkened too much on the edges.  These were perfect tenderness with the temp adjustment.  I made my coconut finer by putting it through the blender.  I didn't have coconut extract (darn) so I used almond extract instead.  Thanks for the recipe, Nan!

I made these exactly as the recipe states, the only thing I changed was rather then putting the dough in the fridge to chill, I sped things up by using the freezer.  They turned out lovely.  Nice and light and very tasty.  I will definately make them again.

3 1/2 stars really. My cookies were not light and airy or as melt in your mouthy as I was hoping. ;-) They were rather tough and chewy. I think this might be my fault.....after creaming together the butter and sugar with mixer, I then mixed in the egg, vanilla / coconut extract and then the flour / coconut. So rather than STIRING as recipe said to do at the egg / extract stage, I kept MIXING.  I am no Alton Brown, but I think by mixing I changed the whole DNA of this cookie! Not sure. They are edible but not the texture I was hoping for. UPDATE! I baked more of these but this time cut a lot thinner and they came out crispy and to me they were way better this way - still probably won't be making these again.

A subtle change from regular sugar cookies, I chopped up the coconut to make it easer to cut out.  You can make a simple frosting from powdered sugar, milk, and some coconut extract to go with them!

very buttery, but a tad too much salt I will cut it back the next time I make these. but I will make them again. I made the rolls a little to large around and only got 2 dozen.

They taste like a coconut sugar cookie. Will definitely make again but will adjust oven temperature to 350 degrees.

I love these cookies exactly as the recipe is written.  This year i added a cup of chocolate chips, a cup of white chocolate chips, and a half cup of chopped walnuts and created the best crispy, tender Christmas cookie ever!

Everyone loved these! So easy to make and the dough was great to work with. I did omit the vanilla and replaced with more coconut extract. Will make again and again.

OMG, I do not leave reviews but I was compelled. If you like coconut, YUM. I added chopped macadamia nuts as a reviewer suggested. These are buttery coconut goodness. I took a tray of mixed cookies to work and these were gone in 5 min. I now have a new favorite cookie. All I can say is TRY THEM, you will not be disappointed.

Baker beware!  These cookies are addicting!  I made the mistake and tried the dough... the only thing that got me to stop eating it was knowing how much raw egg I would be consuming!  These cookies are second ONLY to dark chocolate covered macaroons.

these came out fantastic!!  I made the dough (no mixer, all hand stirring) and put in the fridge till the next night.  I baked 1/2 on silver trays and 1/2 on pampered chef.  They all were delicious.  My husband preferred the ones on the silver baking trays -- a little less crunchy.  WIll definitely make again!!

A nice mild cookie, very light flavor. I baked them at 350 and they still came out a little too crunchy for my taste, next time will make them bigger as the larger ones were more chewy. Also, I did not have coconut extract so made my own: soaked 1T of coconut in 3t vanilla for a few hours and then strained out the soaked coconut and used the vanilla in the cookies.

Absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and mother-in-law couldn't get enough of these cookies. This recipe is a complete "Goldie Locks", not too sweet, not too much coconut, etc. 
I plan to make these again soon. For alterations try very finely ground coconut flakes or as a chocolate chip cookie dough. Yum!

I was excited to make these cookies, but they turned out rather dry.  I saved them by making a yummy lime glaze with powdered sugar, lime juice and zest.  They did taste delicious and tropical that way, but I would not make and serve them without some sort of frosting or glaze.

Delicious! I melted chocolate and frosted each cookie with it. Some I added slivers of almond on top of the chocolate.  This was a nice, crunchy, not too coconutty cookie.  I also used rum extract instead of coconut extract as that is all I had.  Baked at 350 for about 12 mins.

Simple & yummy.  I sliced mine a tad thicker & removed them from the oven just as the edges had the slightest hint of golden-brown, so they were a little chewy, not crispy.  But I think they'd be great either way.  For a party I drizzled them w/melted chocolate & sprinkled w/toasted coconut.

Very surprising.  I usually don't like coconut but my children had been after me to let them see what a whole coconut was all about.  After opening, peeling and shredding, I had to do something with this coconut.  This was just the thing.  I didn't have any coconut extract, so I just omitted it.  They were great without.  I did have to cook quite a bit longer than recommended, but we often have to for high altitude cooking.

Good, next time I might double the coconut extract as I did not think these were all that coconutty.  My husband said they were perfect and I am not tasting things right because I'm pregnant so maybe he's right :)

Great for afternoon tea. A crisp cookie that goes well with a  hot beverage. I increased coconut flavor to 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. -- Got rave reviews from guests.

Lovely crisp biscuit, always have a spare in the freezer.  Have added pistachio nuts and cranberries and cut the coconut in half, also dried apricots and almonds, a very versatile cookie
