This is sooo good, Ive made this recipe a dozen times now, and have tweaked it every time- to what's on hand or what we feel like haha! Tonight I'm using 3/4 lb. of deli roast beef, mushrooms, red onion, garlic, olive oil, provolone, peppers, spices of choice, a little soy sauce while stir frying, reducing liquids- till I get a 'seer' - cook @ 375* for 20min, put some mozzarella on top of provolone- then up to 400* for 10min....mmmm, â€¦..we love it!!!

This was a big hit.   The seasoning was spot on.  The only thing I did different was cut the peppers in half and stuffed the bowl of the pepper and added additional cheese..  I used the top of the pepper for another recipe.

That was interesting. Followed the recipe and yes, it was a little bland.  I did par boil the green peppers, which you really have to do, otherwise they will be pretty tough. So what's missing? Some flavor. As a quick fix we spooned a little bit of medium salsa on them which helped immensely. It does take things away from the philly cheese stake genre a little but it needed it.
Make it again? Definitely. I will layer some extra provolone inside as well as a tablespoon or so of salsa in there.

Love looking for a way to cut down on our bread intake. These were SO good and easy to make. My 11yo wasn't sure if he wanted to eat them but I made him at least try them and 10 minutes later his plate was pretty much licked clean. We just picked them up and ate them. I did not drain my meat after cooking them so they were a little greasy. next time I will drain first. One of hubbies favorites.

I would give it 5, but my husband (who doesn't like peppers) said it was just okay, so I'll lower it to 4.  But I loved it.  Savory without bread or sugar which are my nemeses.  I used green, red and orange bell peppers and thought they added a fun touch.  I also used a different brand of Steak Seasoning that had no salt in it, so I needed to add salt.

This is a 5-star, protein packed dish.  I used red peppers; I also bought a pound of deli-sliced eye of round.   I used 2 t. of the Montreal steak seasoning.  The next time I make this dish (which will be soon) I will par-boil the peppers for about 5 minutes.

This was goooood! I changed a few things. I made a smoked gouda and american cheese sauce to pour in before baking. I also used fresh steak instead of frozen. In a few of them I added rice to the bottom placed a few thin pieces of smoked gouda on the rice and then put in the steak and then poured the cheese sauce. The cheesier the better.  I might put them in at a lesser temp next time to soften the pepper and at the end jack it to 400 and then put the provolone on. Super super good.

Excellent!  Recommend boiling green peppers first to soften them and serve with steak sauce!  My new fav!
