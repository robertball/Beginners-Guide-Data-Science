I followed the recipe exact, only omitting the cinnamon. Delicious hot chocolate recipe but it could use a little more chocolate, in my opinion. Very creamy.

I tripled this recipe & used skim milk with the half and half.  I slightly decreased the milk after reading other reviews.  I also added a bit more cocoa. I did add about a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips when adding the milk & half and half.  The dark chocolate chips melted into the mixture as I was stirring, and they gave the hot chocolate a rich chocolate flavor.  I can't wait to share a cup of cocoa with my husband who has been out plowing snow on this frigid December day.  Thanks, Katherine-Ann!

This is most definitely a 5 star recipe. The chocolate sauce is very rich and the addition of cinnamon and vanilla make this recipe a keeper. I highly recommend it! Thanks for sharing!

I've been trying a different hot cocoa every week. This one achieves a rich chocolate flavor with just cocoa, not chocolate, which is nice. It is important to up the cocoa to 1/2 a cup. Mixing the dry ingredients with boiling water was a great way to prevent lumps. I'll be making this a lot.

I am horrible for changing recipes, since I almost never have the exact ingredients on hand (no milk or cream), and can't help but "tweak" as I go. This was very good and I imagine even better if I had made it exactly as written. 
Here's my version:
Whisked 1/4c white sugar, 1/4c confection sugar, almost 1/2c cocoa, and about 1tsp cinnamon in pot. Slowly added about 1/2 c boiling water while whisking over heat to make beautiful chocolate syrup. Boiled while whisking about 2 min. Added about 3/4 c almond milk. Allowed to heat, then added about 3 c vanilla milk kefir and heated just a bit more (didn't want to over-heat for fear of killing too many of the probiotics). Served immediately topped with Vanilla Fudge Crackle ice cream. Needs a little more tweaking, but pretty delicious!

My grandson loved this hot chocolate.  You can make it ahead and put in quart cans with lids in the refrigerator and simply pour it into a coffee cup and microwave it a minute or so until its hot.  Tastes even better the next day.  I only omitted the cinnamon.

I didn't have half-and-half or straight cream, so I decided to skip it. Depending on how chocolatey you like your cocoa, from my personal opinion I think it was very chocolatey. I love chocolatey hot cocoa but this one was a little off, it could have been from me skipping the half-and-half. To make it not so chocolatey I put 3 tablespoons of water(in my one helping) and 5 tablespoons of whipped cream. It helped but not as much, because it tasted like watered down hot cocoa.
I personaly would not make this again.
One of my favorite recipes for hot cocoa is, Classic Hot Chocolate from Food Network;

Yeilds: 4-6 servings

Ingredients:
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch Kosher salt
6 ounces milk chocolate, chopped
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
Marshmallows or whipped cream for topping

Directions:
1. Combine milk, heavy cream, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium saucepan. 
2. Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the sugar and cocoa powder dissolve and the milk is steaming; do not boil.
3. Whisk in half of the chopped chocolate until melted, then whisk in the remaining chocolate until smooth.
4. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.
5. Pour into mugs, top with marshmallows or whipped cream and enjoy!

This is a rich, chocolate-y, creamy hot chocolate. Since I had skim milk, I used 1 cup skim and 1 cup half and half (I cut the recipe in half). I made mine strictly in the microwave, and I couldn't ask for any better. I love what that little bit of cinnamon does for it.

Outstanding and not very complicated. Didn't have half-and-half. Guests agreed that substituting Irish Cream for the half-and-half  was fantastic. Adults only of course for that variation.

This is unbelievable!
The taste is so smooth, although I lack vanilla extract and cinnamon powder, and use brown sugar instead of white one. Very recommended for cold or chilly day.

Followed recipe exactly as  given. Great hot cocoa. I also used special dark cocoa instead of regular and the flavor was more chocolatey. Also, I used a 1/4 cup more half-and-half with 1/4 cup less milk and it was even creamier. It makes four cups of hot cocoa (servings not visible in the recipe), so plan accordingly.

It was similar to what my mom made after a day of tobogganing with my friends. Maybe a bit too sweet and a bit too chocolatey. Next time I would reduce both. Thank you for sharing.

Amazing as is. If you want to make Mochas - this recipe and LavAzza Gran Selezione are your best friends! We have some family allergies, so there were some essential recipe changes that were ounce for ounce substitutions. Two in our house can have dairy, but not lactose. Heavy whipping cream doesn’t have lactose. So we used Rice Milk 1:1 to replace the milk, omitted the water, bloomed the chocolate in half the rice milk, which is easier to boil than milk. Then we added the rest of the rice milk and other ingredients. We used heavy cream because Rice Milk is thinner and half-and-half has lactose. Together, this was Amazing! Really delicious, although, I tend to like thing a touch less sweet. So, if I were to make this again for hot chocolate alone I would reduce the sugar by 10% (we measure by weight in grams, so this is fairly easy to do). That is just a personal preference though - I find most things too sweet, and want to keep it that way. I reduce sugar 10% in nearly all recipes, because type II Diabetes runs in my family, so I like to be conscientious of sugar. My Fiancé and our daughter love it as is. At any rate - with a 6oz k-cup of LavAzza, Gran Selezione.... oh... my... goodness... you’ll never want a coffee shop version again :)

I made this recipe 3 ways, and was a hit in every way. I made it exactly as written, sugar free for my diabetic mother, and dairy free for my lactose intolerant sister, and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it!! It will be my go-to recipe from now on!!!

This is a very nice cold weather or any time drink. I used lactose free milk and replaced the half and half with coconut milk.  I enjoy a cup  in the evening.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for the half and half, which I don't usually have on hand.  I used my coffee creamer, Simply Pure by International Delight.  This was very delicious and I will be making it again and again.  Thank you for this recipe!!!!!

The kids LOVED this after a playing in the snow!  Very easy to make and nice and creamy. I topped theirs with the works...whipped cream, sprinkles and marshmallows, needless to say, they were happy (and warm). A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Woke up to a snowstorm and wanted something special to share with the kittens (real kittens, not really giving them chocolate) so I did my best to adapt what's in my cupboard to your 5 star recipe.

My tweaks, present and future:
DAIRY: 
--- the only MILK i had around was 1%. In future I'd like to try the non fat half and half suggestion below for creaminess factor and try 2c milk since I prefer dark to milk chocolate.
--- I haven't had marshmallows in about 30 years so I'd use some WHIPPED CREAM instead.
I used half SUGAR. My tastebuds tend to swing that way. And . . .
CHOCOLATE:
If I want something thick and super sweet I may shave and mix in an excellent chocolate such as  http://www.tazachocolate.com/collections/discs/products/guajillo
The chocolate bar version is a more deluxe drink a la Burdick's: http://www.burdickchocolate.com/drinking-chocolate.aspx
Oh! & really I need to buy a whisk! 
Thanks for the recipe. You brought coziness into my home on a chill winter night.

First time trying REAL hot cocoa...will be making it again! I had to tweak it a bit as I didn't have any half-n-half. I added 2x the water, 1/3 c more milk and 3T dry creamer. Add marshmallows on top, and it was wonderfully good on this cold, winter day! :)

I really liked this recipe! I've made it a couple times and first time boyfriend Loved it, second time all of his friends were asking for seconds. I made it the second time with brown sugar because I forgot I was out of white (my B) but it turned out the same and I used a little less than 1/3 c chocolate.  But this is a keeper and makes about  6 8oz servings :)
