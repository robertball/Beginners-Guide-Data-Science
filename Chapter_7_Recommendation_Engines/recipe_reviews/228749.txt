For a real Greek salad, I agree with a prior reviewer to replace the malt vinegar with balsamic and delete the sugar but you also have to add the key ingredient:  fresh chopped oregano, at least a couple of tablespoons.  A couple of chopped anchovies also add a great flavor.

This was SO GOOD!  Used red bell pepper and omitted kalamatas as I didn't have any.  Added a dash of dill just because.

I changed out the malt vinegar and used white balsamic (gives a lighter color than regular balsamic) omitted the sugar and added 1 tbs of dried oregano. It was delicious!

This is a great salad as/is!  I left out the olives and green bell pepper and left everything else the same.  The sugar takes away some of the tang from the vinegar so it wasn't really sweet at all.  Just tangy and delicious.  I also added some diced avocado because it was on hand (and a squeeze of lime to prevent browning).  Positively yummy!
