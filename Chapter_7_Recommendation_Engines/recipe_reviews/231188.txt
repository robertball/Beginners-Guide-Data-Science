Very easy way to make a quick individual pizza. I always use pita flat bread for the crust though. There is also no need first fry the pita bread just dress and throw in the toaster oven.

Decent enough pizza dish. I left off the ham though. My crust turned out nice and crispy!

This was SO easy and fast! I had weight loss surgery and can't eat regular pizza one of my favorite foods ever. For this I used whole wheat tortillas and some homemade Canadian Bacon. Delish! A new favorite!

This is a fast recipe to get dinner on the table quick. I made it using the ingredients as written but used fresh pineapple rather than canned and co-jack rather than straight mozzarella as that is what I had on hand. We liked this but still prefer our Hawaiian pizza with bbq sauce rather than pizza sauce. Served this with a tossed salad.
