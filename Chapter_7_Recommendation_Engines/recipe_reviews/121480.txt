This was a great idea for a sandwich. I did have an issue with the egg setting up, it fell apart when I went to turn it into the omelette. I did use green onion and fresh garlic, I left out the parsley, and added diced cheese. I think that might have been my issue.

Mmmmmm....This is great for breakfast or lunch.  I used green onion, added some diced fresh tomato and instead of serving it on toast I used toasted english muffins and topped the whole thing with melted cheese. Perfect with orange juice.

My husband loves this kind of food.  Instead of serving over toast he loved it over his hashbrowns with toast to the side.  Thanks for the post.

I just made this for dinner and it was very tasty and filling. I like the proportions of the ingredients, which made the sandwiches very flavourful. I made it exactly as written, using red onion and deli sliced ham. I always order toasted westerns in restaurants but I liked this one better. Thank you for the recipe.

My Mom has been making these for over 35 years and we use to think they were a treat to have for dinner. We don't add parsley, but it is a nice addition. And since the recipe does not call for green onion or garlic, I think one reviewer mis-reviewed.

Good filling breakfast.  I served on an english muffin rather that toast along with fresh fruit.  Thanks for sharing.

OK Jackie, looks like I'm your first reviewer!! Hubs and I decided to have a lite dinner tonight being that we ate like oinkers at a party yesterday. I did add chopped tomato, chives and some cheddar. He's an egg lover, so when I told him that I was making him eggs for dinner he was absolutely thrilled!! We both truly enjoyed your recipe and I thank you!!

Good recipe. Certainly creates a filling dish. I think I missed the melted cheese. Would recommend it for breakfast.

I thought I would LOVE this more than I did. I felt like it was missing something. Still a very good breakfast dish that is really filling. My omelet didn't stay together so I just piled the scramble ontop of the toast.

After class today, I didn't have much time to make a decent sized lunch, so I made this. I followed the recipe as written; didn't add or subtract anything, and it's perfect. I think next time I'll add some minced garlic and diced jalapeno. Well done, Jackie.

I did an ingredient search and came up with this sandwich. My mom used to make these for us!! I didn't have ham so I used 3 strips of bacon. (halved the recipe) I put ketchup on one side of my toast and mayo on the other, it was a party in my mouth, YAY!
