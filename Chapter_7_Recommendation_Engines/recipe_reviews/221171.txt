SO Good, in order to make it smooth I placed it all in a blender. I also added a few carrot which make it a more pleasant color.  Added a Tea. of garlic and a an envelope of dry Hidden Valley Ranch dressing.

I loved mashed cauliflower. This is an excellent recipe. The cauliflower comes out creamy and bursting with flavor.

Very good! For those who had an issue with smoothness, try this: once you drain the cauliflower, pop it back into the pan again with the lid on (not on the heat) and let stand for 2-3 minutes before proceeding. 

I used a lot less breadcrumbs and reduced fat sour cream. The immersion blender got it all nice and smooth and I was able to bake it right in the pan I used on the stove for easier cleanup.

I altered it a bit because we are dairy free :( but I put a tbsp of margarine, a clove of garlic, s and p, 2oz manchego (sheep milk) cheese and some water in the food processor.  OMG! So Good!

Really loved this recipe. It didn't have that strange aftertaste that a lot of mashed cauliflower has. I read the reviews about the consistency so I also used a blender to make it creamy and smooth before baking it. Next time I want to add some Parmesan cheese. Also instead of regular breadcrumbs I happened to have a mixed bag of tries units and crackers that I ran through a chopper to make homemade breadcrumbs. I'm sure regular breadcrumbs are just as good

It was crumbly rather than creamy but I liked it. I baked mine on the grill while the steak grilled, and it is about 400 degrees at that spot int he 'oven' (grill).

Very tasty! I added havarti cheese slices to the top before baking and Parmesan cheese in the mix. May cook cauliflower longer next time. It wasn't creamy but nonetheless still really good! Will probably add sautéed onions next time with Panko Bread crumbs.

I tweaked this recipe and it was FANTASTIC!  I added a cup of fresh basil and a half a cup of parmesan cheese.  I also used a full tsp. of pepper and 1.5 tsp. of salt.  I also used the blender trick, instead of mashing it.  Everyone in my household went back for seconds and then thirds.  Yum!

Delicious. Followed the directions almost exactly: used 1.5 tablespoons of freshly minced yellow onion and panko flakes instead of dried onion and breadcrumbs. Must purée, masher won't work as it leaves it granular and inconsistent. Can def jazz it up with herbs and spices if you want to.

Oh my goodness! This was so good! I will never make mashed potatoes again. I read the other reviews and did not add the breadcrumbs, instead I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  I added 3/8 of a cup of sour cream instead of the half cup. I added the salt and pepper before blending it.

The mashed cauliflower tasted great, but putting one cup of breadcrumbs on top of it ruined it.  I thought it seemed odd to add an entire cup of dry breadcrumbs on top but many reviewers said they followed the recipe exactly and liked it so I did it.  But in my opinion having a couple inches thick of dry breadcrumbs on top made it gritty and disgusting. Next time I will serve the mashed cauliflower after mixing it with the butter, milk, and sour cream, and skip baking it in the oven with the breadcrumbs on top.

It had the consistency of applesauce. I would suggest halving the milk and sour cream.

Very good! I loved the presentation of this, it looks irresistible! I forgot to buy sour cream so I used cream cheese instead. I have had mashed cauli before but the bread crumbs & baking made this one my favorite.

Fairly bland, but good enough as a side dish.  Next time I will top with shredded cheddar to increase flavor, and use Italian bread crumbs.  My husband liked this and that’s saying a lot.  Sometimes veggies are a hard sell!

After cooking on the stove creamed it in the food processor.  Quick and very smooth consistency.  Only thing I would do differently is half the sour cream and milk.  Can always add more.  The overall flavor was delicious.

Good, I added grated Parmesan. Needs to cook longer, and rest for longer. Consistency took a bit to get creamy even with an immersion blender. Taste was good though. Will try again!

This was amended to low carb by leaving out Panko crumbs. It also fits a Keto diet. There’s great potential here. Spices: a bit of paprika, chives, your choice.

Way too many breadcrumbs are called for.  Next time I make this recipe, I will reduce the bread crumbs significantly.  Also, I'll boil the cauliflower in some stock or add salt to the water to add more overall flavor to the dish.

Yum #2! I actually made my own bread crumbs too, 'cuz I was out and had some stale bread. I did NOT use a mixer, just a potato masher, because I liked the texture rather than creamy. And I never add salt, but added lots of garlic, Italian seasoning, dill, pepper.  Great texture, easy. Could definitely substitute olive oil for butter and/or Greek yogurt for sour cream (I used non-fat sc). Could kick up with bacon bits, chives, etc... too.

It's a good recipe but 1/2 a cup of milk makes it mushy. It needs more seasoning than salt and pepper. The last time I made it I used hidden valley dressing like some reviewer suggested and it tasted great. It's a great way to eat cauliflower. I'm glad I discovered this recipe. Thanks

I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I ran the cauliflower mixture through my small Magic Bullet blender. The cauliflower tasted great, but I wish I hadn't used the bread crumbs. I used only half the amount, and it was too much. I ended up scraping most of it off.

No, it doesn't taste "just like mashed potatoes"... but it was pretty darn good! Personally, I think a whole cup of bread crumbs was kind of thick on top and will probably go with a half cup next time, but it certainly didn't take anything away from the dish.

I loved this recipe, even though I did not blend it smooth because my hand mixer broke, the taste is fantastic and look forward to making them again soon!

I made some modifications with suggestions from other reviewers, plus a few of my own and this was honestly better than most of the mashed potatoes I've had.

First, I boiled the cauliflower and two carrots in chicken broth.  After draining, I combined the butter and milk from this recipe and added 1/2 cup of herb and garlic rondele cheese.  I seasoned and recovered for 5 minutes, used my immersion blender to smooth it out and followed the rest of the recipe.  Warm, rich, flavorful and a beautiful color.  Easy and delicious.

I really like this recipe. It's quick, easy and tasty. I have been trying to eat less potatoes since they aren't necessarily good for you. Cauliflower is a superfood, and this mashed cauliflower recipe is a great way to make something that taste similar to mashed potatoes.

I tweeked the recipe to what I had already at home and loved it. I put a bag of frozen cauliflower in a pot with almond milk about a quarter up the pot. I let it simmer to soften the cauliflower with garlic salt, pepper and McCormick vegetable seasoning. Once the cauliflower began to soften, I added a container of roasted garlic hummus as a substitute for the sour cream and bread crumbs that I didn't have and mashed it all together on medium heat. It was absolutely wonderful! Loved it and the consistency was wonderful for my first try. I'm sorry I have no measurements. This took about 20 min. Quick and easy.

This is a great alternative for mashed potatoes! I boiled the cauliflower in veg broth, not water. I was heavy handed with the sour cream (closer to 3/4 cup), sub'ed Half & Half for the milk and creamed it with my immersion blender. I made it up in the morning and baked it when I got home from work. My husband is highly skeptical of any change, but said to keep this recipe around! That's HUGE in our house!

I made a slight change and replaced bread crumbs with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Just before pulling it out of the oven I put on a generous amount of parmesan and when melted turned on broiler to brown slightly.  It was so awesome and made this dish gluten free.

Great mashed cauliflower. The recipe calls for way too many bread crumbs. I will decrease by 1/2 next time.

Yummy alternative to mashed potatoes. Still has the consistency even if you like them lumpy or smooth. I chose to add a little cheese salt and sour cream to mine. They were a little blah but I still really enjoyed them and look forward to doctoring this recipe up often!

This was great!  My hubby and son do not like Cauliflower, but they ate a good side dish of this and said, for cauliflower, it was the best they way they've ever had it.  I steamed it for 10 minutes, and used a little garlic powder in the Food Processor where I let it mix for about 1 minute.  Otherwise made it exactly as written.  I personally loved it.

Pretty much followed it exactly with exception we used reduced fat sour cream and light butter, and we loved it.  Next time I might try adding some cheese to change it up a little.

We did not anticipate liking this. But we did! Not perfectly creamy, but that's ok. It was mildly flavored and satisfying.
