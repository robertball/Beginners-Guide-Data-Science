Very refreshing and delicious!  I was unable to find fresh or frozen cranberries because they are out of season, so I doubled the frozen raspberries.  I do not have an ice cream maker so I used a shallow glass dish which I place in the freezer and stirred every half hour for the first 2 hours.  This procedure worked great.  In the fall, I will be sure to freeze my own cranberries just for this recipe.  This recipe makes for not only a refreshing delicious dessert but a delightful looking one as well.  Thank you Larkspur for such a fantastic recipe!

Wow! This is SO good - perfect sweetness/tartness, smooth, excellent - not to mention an amazing color! The ingredients can be a little tricky to find at this time of year. I already had cranberries in my freezer, thank goodness.  My regular grocery store doesn't carry unsweetened raspberries, but I found them at another store. There was only one brand of cherry juice that I could find, so that's what I used. Each of the ingredients is well worth working for. I'm amazed and impressed. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made one switch out--I used Truvia in place of the sugar (Using Google and quick math, I came up with 42 packets). I used RW Knudsen Tart Cherry Juice in this recipe and fresh lime juice. This was a little work but totally worth it in the end. I do not have an ice cream maker, I actually froze this in a freezer friendly container. After it firmed up, I ran it through the blender again and re-froze. Even without an ice cream maker, this turned out fantastic. It was a little sweet with the Truvia--what I'd do next time is cut back just a touch. Still we enjoyed it, eating it all in one night!

This was a great recipe. I used fresh strawberries instead of cranberries as I wanted the sorbet a little sweeter. I also used blue agave nectar instead of white sugar (I use that in all my ice cream recipes). I recommend straining though as there are a lot of seeds. My friends at the bbq raved and the kids couldn't get enough "ice cream"!

This recipe is incredible!  I am just sorry I made it for someone else.  It's the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  Like another reviewer, I had to sub fresh strawberries instead of cranberries because I couldn't find either fresh or frozen cranberries.  I strained the pulp as directed but kept a little bit of it in the mixture because I do like having some fruit remnants in a sorbet.  I used fresh limes for the juice.  I made this for a friend who had her wisdom teeth removed and I hated to give this away, I will be making this again soon!

This stuff is awesome!  Tart, slightly sweet, and a huge burst of flavor in every bite.  It does have a lot of different ingredients that can be hard to find depending on the season.  Luckily, I adore cranberries so I always buy some every year when they are on sale and plop them in my freezer.  The cherry juice, while I only had two options, was actually relatively easy to find in my grocer's juice aisle.  The only issue I had was in straining out the pulp--I couldn't get it to work, so I just pureed everything in my food processor and mixed it all together.  I'm sure that's my malfunction, though.  If you like tart flavors like cranberry, lemon, or lime (which I do, very much!), you'll probably love this.  Very easy too!  Thanks for the recipe!

So good! I made this for an office of 14 and people were eating it up! This recipe is a little messy to make and real cherry juice - for some reason - is pretty hard to find, but it was definitely worth the hassle. There's a reason why 16 people love this recipe.

This recipe was a huge hit for Thanksgiving. It was sweet and a bit tart, which was the perfect after dinner/after dessert refresher!

This sorbet is extra yummy and delicious!  I followed the recipe as written and it turned out wonderfully!  I made the sorbet for a ladies luncheon and everyone loved it. I was worried because one reviewer wrote that it was too sweet, but for us it was a perfect blend of sweet and sour.  The flavor profile is somewhat complicated, and I really like that.  
The recipe makes a good amount; it just fit into my small ice cream maker.  The machine churned for about 45-50 minutes. The recipe is a bit involved, but well worth it for a special occasion. FYI- I squeezed 4 small limes (slightly warmed in the microwave) to get the 1/2 cup of lime juice. Also, I ate the pulp~ I just couldn't let it go to waste.  I bet this sorbet would be a delicious summer drink with a little tequila poured over it.

Cranberries were out of season and i didn't have any stocked up, so I used canned cranberry sauce instead. I couldn't bear to throw out all that delicious pulp so I made cranberry/raspberry tarts out of it.  Both came out very nice!  EDIT:  I combined this recipe with Chef John's "How to Make Vanilla Ice Cream" on here to make a triple berry ice cream and it came out AMAZING! My boyfriend can't get enough of it.

This sorbet is so so yummy!  I switched cranberries for cherries and the switched cherry juice for cranberry juice.  I also probably doubled the raspberries.  I immersion blender-ed the cherries before adding the raspberries, and then just mashed the raspberries with a potato masher, so leave some tasty fruity chunks.  I chilled the mixture overnight in the fridge to make sure everything was REALLY cold before putting it in my Ice Cream maker. Because all the liquid didn't fit in my ice cream maker, I made popsicles out of the leftovers.
