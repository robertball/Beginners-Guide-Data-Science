I normally don’t like Chai Tea, but this recipe has changed my mind. I didn’t add the optional spices and the tea I got was vanilla chai, so I didn’t add the vanilla. Everything else was as the recipe stated. The cookies came out great! I would classify them as a spicy shortbread cookie. An enjoyable changed from a snickerdoodle. The cookies did get a little overdone on the edges, but it didn’t impact the flavor at all.
