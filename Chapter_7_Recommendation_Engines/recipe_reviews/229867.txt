We made this for Easter and totally loved the glaze. The crust was very crispy and the flavors just amazing. We did not make any substitutions.

Loved this glaze! I was concerned about the amount of pepper, but it was fine. This was neither too sweet or too spicy, with nicely balanced flavors.

I made this recipe but I didn't have any red wine so I used rum extract instead and it was awesome!

I substituted pure maple syrup instead of honey and skipped the brown sugar. Used Merlot. It was very good.
