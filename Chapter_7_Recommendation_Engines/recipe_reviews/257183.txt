I m sitting here eating the leftovers of this soup and I have to say this is a lovely soup! I made it in the slow cooker because I had to step out and I couldn t leave a pot on the stove. So I added the water and 2 bone in breasts to my crock pot on high for 4 hours. I put a bay leaf and seasoned the chicken with loom pepper. When I got back I shredded the chicken out it back in the pot with the chicken broth carrot salt and onion. I added a tsp of garlic powder (was afraid fresh would have too much of a bite since the original recipe has it sauteed). An hour before serving I added the broccoli and cauliflower and a heart TBS of lemon juice for freshness. I served mine as is...my guys over egg noodles. This with a Italian bread in the bread machine and we had a hit. Thanks for a different and delicious recipe.

Very tasty soup, given the lack of seasonings. You may need to add a bit more salt at the end, depending on the broth you use.  I simmered the chicken for 1 hour.  This makes a very thick, chunky soup (which I like), but some may wish to add more broth.  The one issue I had was the addition of the veggies at the end. 20-30 cook time would turn them to mush. I simmered the broccoli and cauliflower florets for 6 minutes, then added in the zucchini and simmered for an additional 2 minutes. This is a very versatile recipe, so you can tailor the seasonings to your liking.
