I goofed and bought the wrong cheddar, yellow, not white, but it didn't matter.  This was so darn good (and easy)!  My husband held the title of CHAMPION MAC AND CHEESE MAKER, but guess who just stole the crown?  Yum!  Tomatoes really make this special.  I like that this rec. uses real chesse, not Velveeta.  I would be proud to serve this to my guests!

The bacon and onions really gave it an adult taste, yet kids still loved it. My 1 year old loved it too!

This is a great recipe.  The Cheddar Cheese soup adds a new dimension to the cheese taste and the stewed tomatoes add just the tiniest extra zest!  I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe but instead of white Cheddar cheese, I shredded pepper jack cheese for an added kick.

This recipe is not as creamy as a southern cook or diner might prefer.  It also lacks flavor.  It is indeed quite simple to make, a definite plus.  The varied textures of the soft pasta with the crispy bread crumb topping are also nice.  I added some freshly cracked pepper and paprika on top of the pasta prior to covering the dish with the remainder of the cheese and bread crumbs.  I also used a bit more cheese and doubled the amount of bread crumbs.  Still, the dish did not turn out as cheesy as I would have preferred.  I could not find shredded sharp white cheddar cheese, so I bought blocks and shredded them myself.  I would suggest adding a dash of salt to the recipe to bring out the flavors.  Overall, the family seemed to have enjoyed the recipe.  Nevertheless, they all agree it could have been creamier/cheesier.

Excellent recipe, I did tweak it a bit by adding a teaspoon of white pepper and a teaspoon or so of onion powder to the cheese sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

Was really good!  I used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes.  I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup cheddar cheese into the soup mix and added more cheese to the top layer.  My husband loved it!!

Not what I expected. Family refused to eat it after the first and second bites. I ate some but it just didn't fit my expectations.  Next time, I'll find a recipe that does not include tomatoes.

Great comforting meal. I especially love the addition of the stewed tomatoes. I personally add a little more bread crumbs to the top... it's the best part.

This was okay.  It definitely needs salt and pepper and next time I think I'll add scallions or something to give it more flavor (it's a little bland).  I would double the amount of tomatoes and I'm not really sure what the cheddar cheese soup does for this recipe because it is SO diluted with that much milk so I'll use at least half a cup less of milk next time.  I think with all those "tweaks" it will turn out creamier next time.  Otherwise, it didn't taste bad.

I've made this recipe quite a few times but have forgotten to review it. Hubby, who is not a big fan of mac and cheeses dishes really likes this.  It goes great with meatloaf and a side veggie.

My family really enjoyed this!  The recipe couldn't be any easier, which I loved!!  I really liked the flavor of the tomatoes with the mac and cheese but felt like the stewed tomatoes were just too large and needed to be throughout the mac and cheese...I am going to try using diced tomatoes next time.   I used yellow extra sharp cheddar only because the white was only sold in a block and I had no desire to shred the entire block =)

Oh my!  I love this recipe!  The prep time is a little long, but it's well worth it.  I make it every couple of weeks, and take it to folks when they are shut in, bring home a new baby, etc.  They love it, too!

I have never tried this recipe, but I have had macaroni and cheese with stewed tomatoes, and it is delicious.
I didn't know if other people have tried this. It is a recipe my boyfriend made (out of this world-maybe a few variations) and I know nobody who has had it like this. It really shouldn't be called mac and cheese because it is a great meal, not like Kraft.

I think this recipe is a good base. I added an extra can of cheddar cheese soup, lots of seasoning and some hot sauce. The tomatoes are good but I would have preferred diced so I'll use diced next time. I also used more bread crumbs than what the recipe called for. I baked it covered until the last 10 minutes. It turned out super cheesy, creamy and delicious!

Quite bland, however, I think kids might like it.  If i were to make it again, i'd use fresh tomatoes and I'd use all the white cheddar at once in order to make it taste fresher, otherwise, the soup is over powering.

Way too bland. I added ham to it also for a full casserole type meal. Next time I will try to add more salt and other seasonings. Otherwise, it's a good start.

This a really good recipe!  Easy to put together and delicious. I used the recipe as Renee provided and chose to add one TBS of hot sauce to suit my taste.
Minced onion may have embellished it well.
Give it a try and see

Loved this!  The only thing was that I didn't have tomatoes in the house but I made bacon and threw that in there - yum yum!!

Needed flavor, but great basis to go from. I use mild cheddar cheese and onions to add flavor.

This was pretty good, with a few adjustments.  I used cheddar cheese, and mixed in half the cheese into the milk & soup.  And the tomatoes, I drained it, and chopped up the tomatoes.  I don't mind that the top not be so crunchy, so maybe next time I will put more of the cheese into the milk & soup, and less on the top.

It was good. The top didn't get as crunchy as I would have liked.

I loved it. Should note that I substituded condensed tomato soup instead of the cheddar soup and I used part skim mozzarella for the Cheddar to help lower the fat. Still wonderful!

Wasted good cheese with this one.  It was not creamy at all - I'm not sure if it's the 1 1/2 cups of milk or what but it was very, very, bland.
