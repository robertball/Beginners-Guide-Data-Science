I've  been making a similar greek yogurt every week for 2 years now and track every variable (OCD?).
Using a thermometer at every step ensures consistent results.  First, heat to 180 f  then cool to 110-120f.  add your yogurt culture mixing very well.  Keep around 110f for about 10 hours (I use my oven on the bread proofer cycle.  Towels & a heating pad work great too)
I like my Greek yogurt very thick so I pour my yogurt into a kitchen strainer lined with 2 huge coffee filters (gallon size commercial BUNN -AMAZON has them) and strain on the counter  for 4 to 6 hours.  It wont go bad because of the high acidic content.  Keep the whey for yummy homemade soup or smoothies.  I whip my finished yogurt and store in glass mason jars (keeps best in glass).   Save some to start your next batch but if you're not making more within a week, freeze the reserved yogurt and take out of the freezer when needed.  I've even used mine frozen but it takes much longer to mix it thoroughly int o your 115f milk.
There are so many variables, each can change your yogurt results in some way.
one important note of caution, heating to 180f changes protein structure  and gives culture (a bacteria) a clean slate in which to grow.  Adding anything (the cream for example) after it has cooled introduces a competing bacteria back into the batch which could possibly contaminate it.  If using the cream, add it to the milk then heat it to 180f., cool and innoculate with the yogurt culture.

My family has also been making (Armenian) yogurt for generations. I followed this recipe and it makes wonderfully thick and creamy yogurt! Instead of using towels around the bowl, I like to put the bowl in the unheated oven for the night (keep the oven OFF!). Also, although not Armenian in style, this is really good with a bit of honey and some lime zest mixed in.

I made this for the first time using organic milk and half and half. I was skeptical, but it turned out perfectly! As good as premium store bought for half the price. Warming the milk and then waiting for it to cool down takes a while, but what could be easier than mixing three ingredients together, wrapping towels around it and then leaving it sit in the oven overnight?

I followed the recipe as given and omitted the whipping cream.  It was a little thinner than I like, maybe due in part to sneaking a peak halfway through the process, so I drained it using a fine mesh strainer for about 20 minutes.  Turned out thick and creamy.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Having trouble with the reviews tonight! "Hye" Sherrylann! Thanks for publishing this recipe. Like your husband we have a long history with yogurt. Mom's culture died out before she passed years back and I've been too lazy to start a new starter. This motivated me. I currently buy Mountain Hye. Not bad but NOTHING like homemade. My Kids will thank you also! Anyone reading this, this recipe makes "The Kind". If you prefer a more tart yogurt as does my family, literally leave it out in a warm spot until desired tartness is achieved. Excellent for dressings, sauces, marinades. Add fruit, a bit of vanilla and a sprinkling of sugar or Splenda (I'm diabetic) for a wonderful dessert or plain with crackers broken up in it as do we.

All I can say is... Yum!! I made this recipe yesterday, and was able to taste it tonight. It set up nice and creamy and delicious. I will be making this again.  I put the mixture into two 1 qt mason jars, and placed them inside my crock pot, (not on or plugged in). I used a heated pad that you warm in the microwave.

I was pleased with how easy this was.  It was a little time consuming standing stirring the milk, but it was worth it!!!  it was so creamy and rich!!  I did add the heavy cream because that's what I knew I would like - and I did!!!  It's better than the premium yogurt that is so expensive.   I did wrap mine in a bath towel instead of 4 kitchen towels.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  If someone can - can you tell me how long this will last?  I'm a senior citizen and I don't go through a ton of yogurt, but I'm so glad I made this - it's delicious!!  I added granola and fresh raspberries - great breakfast!

My family buys a lot of yogurt, so I decided to try making it and this is the recipe I decided on. Wow! Not only was it easy to make but taste way better than the store bought stuff. I will be making this for a long time to come. It even got the stamp of approval from the harshest food critics on the planet...... my children.

Very easy to make. I used organic Greek yogurt as a starter. All other ingredients I used  were organic and I did add the heavy whopping cream. So delicious and creamy. I'm thinking that I'll make 1/2 batch next time. I used some of it to make dressing and tzatziki.

I made organic yogurt. Except using half and half and whipping cream I used sour cream. 1g of organic whole milk, 1-6oz container of organic yogurt and 6oz of sour cream.

Excellent recipe! I omitted the heavy cream, and it came out perfectly. Much, much cheaper thank buying the store bought. Next time I'm going to use skim milk though, because I didn't realize how high the fat content was.

Very much like kafir. I like more yogurt with more tang so I'll do it with lower fat but my Russian and Brazilian friends prefer this style.
