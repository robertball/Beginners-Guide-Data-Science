This recipe was everything it was said to be.  I would like to add that you can make the sauce ahead of time to cut down on the preparation, but either way, this is definitely a keeper!  Wonderful dinner party recipe.

Suprisingly delicious!  My wife and I were initially thrown off by the idea of rasberries on chicken but were raving about this dish while we enjoyed every last bite!  Instead of pan-frying the chicken, we PAM fried it with a bit of flour like we do for all pan fried recipes to make it healthy.  It seems as if it would probably go great with grilled chicken as well.

This was great! And guess what...the second time I used tenderized pork steaks and beef broth instead of chicken broth......Served it with sweet potatoes and a green salad - it was still awesome!

I was a little nervous making this based on conflicting reviews, but it was the only recipe that I had ingredients on-hand for and it turned out pretty well! I started by marinading the chicken in a raspberry salad dressing while I was preparing the rest of dinner, then took the chicken directly out of the marinade and dredged in a flour mixture (1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning) then browned in a skillet with olive oil. For the sauce, I only had one can of chicken broth, but I went ahead and used the amount of garlic the original recipe called for, but I skipped the 1st reduction step. Next, I added 1/2 cup raspberry cranberry applesauce (Motts single-serve container) and 1/4 cup of frozen apple raspberry juice concentrate, 1/4 cup white cooking wine, and the salt called for. I simmered it until it had cooked down to a reasonable sauce consistency, then poured it over the cooked chicken and topped with fresh raspberries. Because I had used the applesauce I didn't need to mess with the cornstarch to thicken anything. Wished I had had the frozen raspberries on hand to make more sauce, but it turned out delicious as it was. Served with a spinach salad with raspberries and a raspberry viniagrette, steamed asparagus and rolls.

I was worried that after all the work it took to put this together, that it would taste as if I'd thrown it together. IT WAS AMAZING! My husband & brother gave it a 10! It is well worth the effort.

I found this a bit time consuming, but well worth the time!  I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper and did not reduce the liquid as much as directed.  My guests raved and all agreed it deserved a five star rating!  Next time I will make the sauce ahead and refrig.  A Great Chicken Variation!

I found this recipe just OK.  In my opinion the effort was not worth the outcome.

I enjoyed the juicy tenderness of the chicken when making this recipe. My family really enjoyed the sweet tang of the rasberries.  Next time I'm going to take some of the excess sauce, thicken and serve as a sort of dipping sauce.  The sauce was so delicious and you could hardly taste it on the chicken.

This recipe was good, but perhaps not great.  It got mixed reviews from the diners-- from terrific enthusiasm to "it was okay."  One shortcoming of the recipe-- it is fairly demanding and time consuming to make.  Most of the time is spent waiting for the liquid ingredients to reduce (twice).  We are not sure whether or not we would make it again.  Maybe it deserves a second try.

I found the recipe lacked something.  I think if the flour was seasoned with salt and pepper, it would have tasted better.

This recipe is good.  Not as good as it seems it would be with the time you spend and ingredients you use, though.  I do not want to discourage anyone from making this recipe, but be prepared to wonder why you spent so much time making something "good", when you could save time by using cranberry mustard and have a similar-tasting meal in much less time.

Don't make again.  I didn't get the raspberry flavor.  The cornstarch and the flour gave this a gummy non-descript taste.

Do not bother with this recipe!  It is not worth the time and cost.  The raspberrry sauce has almost no flavor!
