I found the taste and nutritional value great but was planning a party so made it early in the week and found by the weekend the corn cereal I used (Crispix) was soggy - rather disappointing.

Overall this is a great snack mix to have on hand. I used just dried cranberries instead of a tropical dried fruit mix. The corn cereal does get a bit soggy/moist which is a downfall, but I still like it overall.

Don't put cereal in until ready to serve.  It absorbs moisture from other ingredients.

I used to do a variation of this with my girl scouts. I would line up ten different ingredients, give them a ziploc bag, and let them create their own trail mix before a hike. They loved it!

These are all things I usually have on hand, and it made a nice mix together. I usually have yogurt raisons, but I didn't this time, so I used dried cranberries. I used dried apricots chopped up for the fruit. I had honey nut corn chex, and that was really good in this. *I changed my rating from a 4 to a 3 this morning. The cereal was soggy, and I had to pick it all out of the mix. I'm glad I only made half a batch. Only make enough to eat right away. I will leave out the dried fruit if I make it again.

We liked this recipe.  I probably won't make it again due to the cost of the ingredients.  =)
