Loved it and I only did the beef mixture!  I needed to use up left over bratwurst, so I substituted that for the ground beef and it was great and easy too.  I had no pesto but was still great.  Will make the second casserole next time, thanks!

I loved this recipe! I made both at the same time and froze one so I didn't have to cook on another night. Big plus for a busy mom of twins!

It was excellent my family really enjoyed it. I topped the crab and ham shells with breadcrumbs instead of more cheese. Just watch the salt in the hand ones other than that it was awesome. ?

I just made the beef mixture and I did 3 different sauces! Marinara, Alfredo, and Vodka! So good!

Great recipe, I added Asiago as well added to the flavour. Next time Iâ€™d make the Alfredo sauce on my own with cream and chicken bouillon as the Alfredo sauce in a jar is never the same. Otherwise was delicious!

I made only the ham/crab dish last night, kiddos loved it, grownups thought it could have used some more flavor.
