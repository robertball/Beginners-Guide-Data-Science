I didn't use the chicken stock, just water. Mint was a great addition to this hearty pilaf! This is a very tasty dish!

Made this without the mint or celery (I didn't have either on hand) and I eliminated the salt as well . It was absolutely wonderful and I will definitely make it again. Such a nice change from the usual rice//potatoes/noodle side dish trifecta.
