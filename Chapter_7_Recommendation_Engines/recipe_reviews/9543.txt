Good recipe, Terri. I've made this twice now. First according to the recipe: I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling which there was a little to little of it. I thought the apples being crunchy detracted from the overall flavor. So, the second time I cut the crust by 1/3, upped the filling by another 1/2, and precooked my apples in the cinnamon sugar in the microwave for 3 minutes. Then I arranged the apples in a circular pattern covering the entire top of the torte. While warm from the oven, I covered the top evenly with a cinnamon sugar sauce. Wow! What flavor, and the presentation was beautiful. The ladies at my Bunco party thought I had ordered it from their favorite bakery! Thanks for creating the roadmap that helped me reach my destination....AND keep up my reputation as the best cook in the group! ;)

This was *THE* most gorgeous dessert I've ever personally made. It came out looking like I had spent a gazillion dollars on it at some fancy bakery -- well, until I tried to cut through the crunchy apples!!!! I WISH I had seen the review that suggested to cook them first, because they DEFINITELY need it!!! Also, I think two medium/largish apples would be plenty. Six is WAY too many apples -- and I only used 4 biggish ones, and that was too many. I will definitely try this again, but I think I might try it with my home canned peaches, or maybe pears, next time. It was absolutely delicious -- just very hard to cut because of the apples. If I do the apples again, I know a lot more about how I would do it this time! The bottom crust and the cream cheese part was to die for!!!!! (***UPDATE*** I made this a second time with pears -- two cans canned pear halves, I sliced them -- and it was WAAAAAAAAAAAY better than with apples! I've revised my version of the recipe to be PEAR Bavarian Torte. Try the pears, you'll be delighted!!!)

With the exception of the almonds, which I don't use, this is a recipe I've used for 25 years because it's so darn good! This can easily be doubled; just spread the dough into the bottom and sides of a 9x13" pan. If my gooped, splattered, and dog-eared recipe card offers any proof, this classic recipe is just plain delicious.

OMG! What can I possibly say about this recipe that hasn't already been said - it's fabulous! I didn't change a thing except to leave off the almonds as my husband isn't a huge fan of them. It took a little longer to cook and the smell was divine. When it came out of the oven I couldn't resist topping it off with a warm caramel sauce - just a little. I must say the smell from the oven was definitely an indication of how it was going to taste. My husband devoured his piece and declared that I could make this anytime!

This is a delicious and easy dessert. I suggest pressing the crust 1 1\2 " up the sides of the springform pan, and using almond extract instead of vanilla in the crust (goes well with the almonds in the torte). I also slightly cooked the apples in the microwave for 2 min or so, before I mixed them with cinnamon and sugar. Lastly, after the torte cooled, I used a glaze of strained nectarine jam heated and mixed with a tsp of water to give it a nice glossy finish.

DO NOT MESS WITH THIS RECIPE >> JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS..IT IS PERFECT!
The most impressive and delicious dessert I have had in a long time. I checked out the description of a torte vs a tart and it seems to be a TART
(A tart is a pastry dish, usually sweet, similar to a pie, but different in that the top is open and not covered with pastry.)
 I followed the directions to the T except for the crust and I did not add vanilla.  I cut my butter into the flour and sugar and did not want to mix in liquid so added a sprinkle of cinnamon then patted into the bottom of the spring form....i then put the cheese filling on top of that and I thought the recipe said 4 cups of apples for some reason so that is what i used.  I sliced them in about 1/4" slices and arranged them on edge sticking them down into the cheese mixture making a circle and then filling in the middle.  Baked according to instructions.  I then removed from oven and put about a 1/4 cup of peach preserves on the top and then the slivered almonds and put it under the broiler for a few minutes...(watch carefully)  It was beautiful and delicious!  I even think you could cut back on the sugars somewhat.  Divine! just divine and very impressive!  thanks for sharing this recipe!  Yes I am a food critic! and still able to impress my friends, thanks the these kinds of recipes!

This is possibly the best dessert I've ever made, and desserts are one of my specialties.  Rave reviews from my husband as well.  It didn't last long enough to share it with anyone else! Only made two small changes to the original recipe, following some of the suggestions of other reviewers: microwaved the apple mixture for 3 minutes (and drained 2/3 of the liquid off before putting it on the torte), and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract and 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture instead of 1/2 of vanilla.  It was perfect with the small changes. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Good torte. Loved the buttery taste of the crust - it complements the apples very nicely.

I liked that this recipe sounded easy, with beautiful results.  Well, it was easier than I expected.  I followed the instructions, with the exception of cooking the apples in the mircowave for 3 minutes.  I liked the way the photo looked and decided to layer it... from the bottom, to the top, I used crust, filling, apples, filling, and more apples (arranged in a circular pattern on top).  We did not have the almonds, and so I decided on a cinnamon sugar sauce.  YUM!  Got rave reviews from everyone, and they were fighting over who got the last of it.  This would be impressive enough for guests.  Next time I may glaze it with my Cabernet Sauvignon jelly and use pears, instead of apples.  Thank you, Terri, for a wonderful recipe.  It will be in my holiday repertoire this season as everyone has already requested it.

My mom's been making this recipe for at least 10 years - at any and all occasions, it's dessert.  Warning - it is VERY rich and you only need a little piece!  Soo good, and yet so easy to make!

This is one of the best recipes I've made! MAKE SURE YOU SLICE YOUR APPLES THIN ENOUGH, so that you don't have the same probs as the other readers.  I only needed 3 large apples (the tartness of granny smith was perfect). Make sure you don't use anything bigger than a 9 in pan, or else the yummy crust is spread to thin. Don't worry about just dumping the almonds on the top and spreading them out, they turn out toasty and fabulous!  This is a keeper

Amazing! Great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I pulsed the crust mixture in my food processor and used ice cold butter. I only used 4 apples, sliced 1/4 inch thick and layered them in concentric circles. I also microwaved the apples 2 minutes before layering. Soooo good!

I've made this recipe a couple of times.  I microwaved the apples for 3 minutes before cooking, as suggested.  I also brush on 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top so the apples brown nicely and don't dry out.  Tastes delicious with almonds, but equally wonderful with pecans.  Always a hit!!  Don't hesitate to try this recipe!  So easy and foolproof.

GREAT RECIPE and so easy!! I made two and tried different things with each and my recommendations are: 1) Resist urge to add extra moisture to the crumb mixture. Just press firmly into tin and rely on the juice from the cooking apples to bring it together. 2) Brown sugar works well as a substitute. 3) If you like cinnamon, double it. 4) Def follow others' tips and cook the apples for 3min in microwave first! 5) Pour leftover juice from apples as they cooked in microwave/cinnamon/sugar over torte once you have put the almonds on.  ENJOY!!!

This is a "kill" recipe that I've been baking for 20+ years also. However, my version is to top the torte with apple slices dipped in cinnamon-sugar mix and then starting with the outside edge working in, place the slices in a circular pattern with the slices barely over-lapping. Warm in microwave about 2/3 cup apricot preserves. Gently spoon onto the apple slices and spred covering the entire top. Bake as directed-YUM!!!! Very pretty and looks like an european pastry. I'm sure adding almond slivers before the apricot preserves would add to the look and taste too!

I made this a couple months back and I just saw I forgot to review it!  This dessert is just delish!  I pretty much went by the recipe except when reading the reviews, I thought I should cook my apples just a touch before adding over top.  I sauteed them in a skillet with butter and the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  This gave them a nice carmelized sauce.  I also, when adding the almonds, made up more of a streusel type topping with some butter, flour, brown sugar, and the almonds to sprinkle on.  For the crust, along with the vanilla, I added in some almond extract to give it added flavor.  I ate this both warm and cold.  I think I liked it best cold and served with ice cream!  For me, it didnt have enough apples.  So I definitely will up the apple amount next time, maybe even the cream cheese mixture as well.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again!

I too microwaved the apples for 3 mins. turning every minute. Then I did 2 layers of the filling...cream cheese, apples repeat. Smelled yummy and was very good. Really best served warm out of the oven. Bet it would be great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

This was yummy torte! Great for cream cheese lover!!  The only thing I'd do differently the next time would be, precook apples or do something for the top...  Apple on the top was kind of dried up by baking naked...

The torte is beautiful!  Like others, I increased the filling by a 1/3, and i'm glad I did.  I was able to layer crust, filling, apple, filling, apple beautifully.  I only needed 2 medium Golden Delicious apples, thinly sliced.  I added a cinnamon sugar glaze (1/2 cup water, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon boiled over stove) at the same time as the almonds, and it bubbled SO nicely in the broiler!  Basically, MAKE THIS TORTE, IT'S DELICIOUS :)

AMAZING!  Very similar to those that I had growing up in Germany.  For those that are saying that there is too much crust or that the apples are not cooked enough, they obviously don't know what a bavarian torte is, and were just expecting an apple pie.  The only change I made was instead of tossing the apples in so much sugar, I just sprinkled the cinnamon on top and cut the sugar to about 2 tbsp.

Just happened to see this recipe and thought it sounded good. Boy, is it ever good!!  I used 3 apples and 1 asian pear and microwaved them as other reviewers suggested.  I also used 12 ounces of cream cheese. This dessert is also very easy to put together. I didnt have a springform pan so I used an 11 x 7 baking dish. It fit in there perfectly.  Will definitely make again!!

I made this for Sunday night pot roast dinner. I LOVE THIS RECIPE. First of all, it was SO EASY. Second, it looked so PRETTY. Third, it tasted WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only 4 apples, and I microwaved the apples for 3 minutes. I will be making this often. Thanks much, for this great recipe!

I found this recipe in a magazine at least 30 years ago--wish I could remember the magazine, but I do remember it wasn't a culinary magazine.  However, this has been my go-to company dessert recipe for years.  It is absolutely delicious and always turns out perfectly beautiful.  I've always used Yellow Delicious apples.  I also press the dough 2 inches up the side of the springform pan--looks like it was made in a bakery.

I was super excited to try this recipe, but was bummed by the results. I give this 3 stars based on mine, but since I altered the recipe based on other reviews I had to provide an extra star for making (unneccessary) changes. I think it would have been better written as is. I decreased the apples and doubled the cream cheese filling as recommended by so many, but wasn't nearly as impressed as I was expecting. Not enough apples and too much cream cheese, almost like a bland apple topped cheesecake (made with above changes). I think it would have been much better, and the apple torte I was hoping for, by leaving a thinner cream cheese layer and loading up more apples on top, probably exactly as written. This is the first time I made a recipe based on recommended changes, and then found it was probably better as is written. This was for in-laws Easter brunch... I am the dessert master queen and try to live up to my expectations every time I make them something and was almost dissapointed to be serving this the way it turned out. * PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A GOOD RECIPE, I SHOULD HAVE TRIED AS IS FIRST BEFORE MAKING CHANGES. I will try again as written and make a better review then, probably better!

This was delicious and the only changes I made were to use brown sugar instead of white sugar in the crust and the filling and maple flavoring (personal pref) I microwaved the apples like another reviewer suggested and divided the apples so 1/2 went under the filling and the other 1/2 went on top. Great recipe, thumbs up across the table so I will make this again

I've been making this for over 10 years as a fancier version of apple pie.  Everyone loves it!  You can just sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top of the apples after putting them on the cream cheese filling instead of coating each one individually.  I've also doubled it in a 13x9 to feed a crowd.

Simple to make and looks beautiful on a nice serving plate.  Taste is fabulous.  Everyone loved it at our holiday gathering.  This is really something special.  Will make again and again when I need a nice dessert that everyone will like.  Only change I made was to use walnuts (because I didn't have almonds on hand).

This was a wonderful dessert! My family raved about it! I used a mixture of canned pears and 1 large Granny Smith apple. I also used almond extract in place of the vanilla and did not include the almonds. I baked this in a tart pan to make a prettier edge crust. Beautiful presentation and delicious to eat!

Pretty tasty. I only used three granny smith apples, but should have used at least one more. I doubled the cinnamon/sugar. I put the almonds on before baking, and they turned out okay.

As others have mentioned, this is one of those desserts where it's super easy, presents beautifully, and the taste  heavenly! But definitely precook the sliced apples in the microwave for 3 mins w/ the cinnamon and sugar. Also used 1/4 tsp vanilla & 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of the 1/2 tsp vanilla and only needed 3 big Granny Smith apples. *Either toast the almonds before-hand or closely watch the edges of the torte after adding the almonds.

Great recipe.  I increased cream cheese to 12 oz and added 1 TBS of lemon juice to it and only  used 3 Granny Smith apples. I also lined the springform pan bottom with parchment paper and  brushed  the cooled torte with Apple Jelly.  This is a keeper.

I have made this torte twice now and have gotten rave reviews from both groups I served it too.  It was pretty easy but  elegant dessert.  Looked like I bought it at a bakery.  Will keep this on the top shelf of all time favorite apple recipes.

This is a beautiful presenting dessert and it tastes wonderful.  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  After reading the review I followed their advise and I microwaved my apples for 3 minutes after tossing them with the sugar and cinnamon.  I also only used 4 tart apples instead of 6.  Microwaving them did create extra juice in the bottom of the bowl so I spooned them onto the filling leaving the juice in the bow.  I also increased the filling by using 12 oz of cream cheese, 2 extra TBSP of sugar and 2 eggs.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla throughout the recipe.  I also added dried lemon peel to the apples and the crust.  I baked it an extra 5 minutes at 450 degrees.  I didn't have sliced almonds so I sprinkled chopped almonds on top and baked about 5 more  minutes.  My family was very happy with the results!

Yummy!! Other variations:  add dried craisins; use a refrigerated pie crust and bake in 9" pie plate; substitute peaches for the apples; use a mixture of apples, pears, and peaches; substitute walnuts for almonds; drizzle warmed caramel sauce over all...lots of ideas to this versatile dessert!

I made this using 2 cans of pears (no sugar added) and doubled the cheese mixture.  It was a very pretty dessert and tasted wonderful.  I can't imagine not doubling the cheese filling though; it seems like it would be way too much crust and fruit in comparison.  I baked it 15 minutes at 450 and 35 minutes at 400 in a 9" springform pan and it was perfect.  I didn't find it overly sweet or rich and I have to agree with a previous reviewer, it's even better the next day straight out of the refrigerator.

The base was a bit oily and the cream cheese might've been better layered throughout the apples; perhaps I've missed some instructions. Regardless of the look, 'twas tasty. Thanks for the recipe ^^.

Well, here's a strange one. My husand HATES butter - won't eat anything with butter in it, even if he can't taste it - just knowing there's butter in something will keep him away. So I didn't tell him there was butter in the crust and was nervous because I found it very buttery tasting - but he loved it and didn't mention anything about it being buttery tasting. I asked him to rate it and he gave it 5 stars!! 
The irony is I LOVE butter - and yet I found the crust tasted much too buttery and the filling was just OK. I gave it 3 stars. I've made much better desserts.
So I chose the happy medium and gave it 4 stars.

I scaled it down for two portions and didn't use a springform pan.  I also used blackberries instead of apples.  I cooked them for a few minutes in water, sugar, and cinnamon before I topped the cream cheese mixture.  I also left out the almonds.  I am looking forward to trying this with different types of fruit!

Very disappointed. I shoul've known when I opened the oven door to add the almonds this wasn't going well. Juice leaked from the springform pan & burnt.  Then when I tried to remove from pan, after it cooled, the crust stuck to the bottom, & things fell apart when transferring to a plate.  The crust is good & I could use that in other desserts. The filling leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It gave me a "flashback" to cheesecake, which I don't like. (very overpowering taste) The apples were hard & I did nuke in microwave, as suggested & even in small quantities.

Not oonly did this taste delicious but it looked like a professional baked it.  My Aunt Eleni said on a scale of 1-10 this was a 13 and insisted we take a photograph of it!  The only sub I made was to use almond extract in place of the vanilla which I love and enhanced the almond flavor on top.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made as written, using 5 small granny smith apples sliced thin.  I thought the end result was fabulous.  I only wish the directions were a little clearer.  I woudl recommend softening the butter and cream cheese before trying to mix them.  Also, according to another recipe almost identical to this one it says to refrigerate for a few hours prior to serving.  I did not know that and didn't plan better....ate ours warm tonight but still enjoyed it.  Can't wait to try it cool and more set tomorrow!  This was my first time making and eating any torte of this kind!

WONDERFUL DESSERT!  I saw this recipe on another site and was excited to try it.  I used canned pears as another person suggested because I wanted something just a little different.  WOW!  It was so beautiful, and so delicious.  I got so many compliments when I served this on New Year's Day.  Great recipe!  Don't know why anyone would have trouble making it.  It was simple to put together.  It really couldn't be easier.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly; it was super easy and turned out very well.  Thank you so much!  Oh, I just want to add that initially I was afraid that I had too many apples (I used 4 gigantic apples) because mine weren't nicely layered like I saw other peoples but just piled on top of the cheese mixture.  Nevertheless, by the end of the baking process they cooked down giving off quite a bit of liquid, which also corrected itself after cooling.  So...although I had a few doubts while putting the torte together and watching it cook, ultimately it turned out just fine.

One of my favorite fruits are apples. I have MANY apple recipes and have made all of them many times. This Bavarian Torte is definitely one of my favorites. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the cream cheese mixture and cut back on the apples. I used four medium-large apples and had some left over. I mixed the cinnamon and sugar with the apples and microwaved them for 3 minutes before placing them on the torte. I increased the vanilla and cinnamon because I enjoy both. The result was wonderful.

I tripled this and made it in a jelly roll pan I only used one and a half large apples I diced them instead of slicing them, I also used grounded walnuts I took this to a church dinner and it was a real hit. Thank you for the recipie it was awesome and so easy to make.

This is one of the best cheesecake desserts i've ever made!  It has been a big hit with anyone who eats it.  I usually lay the apples in a spiral pattern and sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top when it's right out of the oven for a wonderful presentation.  I like to use red delicious apples because they're not bitter but sweet

Very tastey.  I cooked the apples for a few minutes like another review suggested.  I think this step was necessary so that the center of the dessert doesn't come out mushy and wet.  Then I placed the apples all around the filling and sprinkled more sugar on top and baked it.  I forgot to add the almonds - so when the dessert was baked I toasted up the almonds in a small frying pan and sprinkled them on top.  Nice flavour.  This is more like a tart than a torte. Would definately make again.  Would be nice for company.  Mmm...

This is a beautiful dish. Everyone thought I bought this at a bakery! One reviewer had a problem with it falling apart and being uncooked. I think that is because the recipe is unclear when it says to push crust on the bottom on pan. You also should press it on the sides. I wouldn't recommend cutting down on the crust amount because it browns nicely now. If you cut down on it, it would burn. I would recommend increasing the cream mixture - it is very yummy! This recipe is a definite keeper. I have made it many times and it is always a crowd pleaser!

This was pretty good warm, but leftovers the next day served cold tasted much better! The crust is more like a cookie than a dough.

The torte ended up so sweet it was impossible to eat it. If you apples are not incredibly sour, the amount of sugar needs to be reduced in 25-30%. 

Sugar overpowered the cake's taste, so I'm not sure if it was good. The creem cheese tasted mediocre.

I made this for game night this weekend and it was a hit. My personal opinion though it was slightly to sweet.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar.  Also I microwaved the apple mixture ahead of time as others suggested and the texture was perfect.  Also next time I will double the cream mixture of use a smallerspring form pan. It baked nicely but once it cooled down wasn't as high as I wanted.

This reminds me of an apple cheesecake recipe but simpler. I made the recipe without changing anything. The baking time took longer than stated. Precooking the apples may have helped. The crust was good and easy to make. I put the crust ingredients in the food processor and then formed it into a ball after processing. I would make this again.

I baked this last night in a pyrex glass pie plate and it stuck a little to the bottom....cream cheese layer was very flat but I guess this is different than the other autumn one on this site.  Everyone liked it and I only used 2 granny smith apples which was enough apples....would probably make again and use the spring pan called for...thanks

I don't really care for desserts with fruit so this one totally surprised me.  Absolutely delicious, will definitely make it again.  I used granny smith apples which were a little underbaked after 25 minutes so next time will bake a little longer.  Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing!

recommend making the crust thicker to get more of the taste. Also be sure to microwave the apples long enough before baking them so that they are softer

AWESOME! Huge hit at my Bunco party!  I did increase the cream cheese to 12 oz like others had suggested and used 2 kinds of apples; Granny Smith's and Washington reds. Will most definitely make again!

I tried to follow recipe as closely as I could except for some additions: -Added 1/4 tsp almond extract to both mixtures. - precooked apples as others suggested (and let me tell u, this was necessary!)in a skillet with a splash of water -Used red delicious applesand added less than 1/4 cups sugar to them.  -Added a bit of milk to almondsbefore adding them to the top and sprinkled them with a bit of sugar on top of tart. Baked 10 minutes and then drizzled the top with the leftover liquid from the apples and returned to bake five more minutes to caramelize. TURNED OUT AMAZING!! i AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT GREAT IF I HAD FOLLOWED RECIPE AS IS AS LONG AS I PRECOOK THE APPLES THOUGH! UPDATE: A couple days later, some of the guests that tried the tart admitted to loving the filling part, but still the topping was not that great. Still not caramelized and cooked through enough.

ok, this is awesome, however i didn't follow the recipe as written, because i still don't know how to cut the almonds, so i used pecans, and i used three times the cinnamon specified, i made this for mothers day because mom and i love cinnamon, it was a total success

fantastic result with a very easy recipe, ready in a flash. I must admit I was skeptical about the crust (afraid it would be crumbly and dry), but how wrong I was! and the apples were nicely caramelized... all in all, this is a great discovery and I will keep it for sure!

This was very good.  Will definitely make it again. My husband and I both enjoyed it.  It is rich, but not too sweet.  Next time, I think I will follow some of the others and cook the apples a little, since the torte was a little difficult to cut.

Excellent!  I used pears because we had an abundant amount, and I made sure to simmer them down with the cinnamon and sugar..  prior to assembling.  When you simmer them for about 10 minutes, it gives off a lot of the liquid.  Just be sure to use a spatula/spoon that strains the liquid, when you begin to place them on the torte.  I decreased the sugar in each layer by half, and it still was plenty (although, I like things not so sweet!). :)  I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes, allowed to cool, and then topped with the cheese mixture and apples(pears).  Even so, the crust was still very soft - so if you prefer a crisper crust, you may want to pre-bake it longer.  This is such a pretty dessert, easy to make, and delicious to boot!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Our family does not use cane sugar so I used granulated palm sugar instead.  The crust is buttery and oh so yummy. This is a recipe I will make time and time again, looks like a dessert from a restaurant.  Thanks!

The crust was buttery and sweet, really good flavor. The cream cheese filling was creamy. I find 6 apples too much, did not microwave as suggested by others and it turned out fine (but then again I used only 2 large apples) topping: used walnuts instead of almonds

Perfect and authentic as is.  My guests also thought that I bought it at a fancy bakery.  For other fruit variations, just replace apples with peaches, pears or berries.    If you are using unripe/hard apples you may want to pre-cook like the others suggested for a few minutes.  My ripe apples were perfect uncooked and allowed a regular knife to make perfect slices when done.

I made this for a dessert bake off contest we had at work to raise funds for a charity.  I won first place and got a day off with pay. Yea!!!
I did alter the recipe a bit, I increased the cream cheese filling by 1.5 which seemed to be perfect. After baking the 25 minutes, I removed from the oven, sprinkled a little bit of sugar/cinn mix on top.  I garnished with pecan halves and marasinho cherries to make it more festive.  The only problem I can find with this recipe is that the crust gets a little bit too hard and is hard to cut thru but it does taste wonderful. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to correct that? This is a wonderful recipe, super easy and tasty.  I will be making this again in about two weeks for our christmas party and the guys who work with my husband are requesting one too.

I have a recipe just like this except I use pears. I also use 1 1/2 and sometimes double the filling. Try this for a spin on the crust: Drop the flour to 3/4 cup and raise the vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp. Add 2/3 cup chopped walnuts to the mix and press into the pan. I think you'll love it!

Easy and wonderful!  Definately is a good idea to soften the apples first in the microwave.  Also I used reduced fat cream cheese and was still great!

I thought this tart was excellent!  The crust is just perfect.  I made it for a party last night, and I had someone ask me if baking was my career.  It really made my day, because someday soon, baking *will* be my career.  Anyway, I also popped my apples in the microwave for three minutes to soften them up first, and I really think that's the way to go.  I added a little more sugar to the juice left in the bowl afterward and popped it back in the microwave to melt it down. I then used the ensuing goo as a glaze to go on top.  I didn't have any almonds, so I skipped that, but it was super delicious anyway.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  The only changes I make is to add a tsp of almond extract to the cream mixture and a 1/2tsp. of almond to the crust.  AMAZING...everyone I've made this for has asked for the recipe and for the leftovers!

Wow - I was really pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  The writing of the recipe - regarding the making of the crust - was a little misleading, however.  I am not such an expert baker that I would have known, for instance, that you really need to cream the butter and sugar together FIRST, until light and fluffy, and THEN add the flour in batches.  That will be key for the next time I make this (possibly ASAP for an upcoming brunch!!). I would suggest using 5 apples only but it really depends on how heavily you want to layer them.  I also agree with other reviewers: cook the apples for 3 min in the microwave first with the sugar/cinnamon to soften them up and THEN, after baking, poor the remaining cinn/sugar water over the top.  Very delish!!!

This was an excellent recipe. Slicing the apples paper thin does well. The cream cheese mixture was a perfect balance. I had a non dessert eater that loved it!I believe that if you add or take away from a recipe that it should not be rated --it is no longer the recipe.

Wonderful, thank you.  I made this for a holiday gathering, and it was gone before all the guests could get through the buffet line.  Simple and satisfying.  And thanks to all the other reviewers for the "precook your apples" tip; that's a must.

thanks everybody for everything. Where were you guys 12 years ago when I needed you, this recipe has revived my self confidence. Everybody devoured it although I thinkit needed a slightly lower oven temp.as it came out a bit burned. I used canned peaches and covered it with walnuts and a peach glaze i made from the syrup left over in the can...you wont be disappointed, the paeches are heaven.Salwa

This is now one of my most recommended "please bring dessert items" I have added a slight variation to it and it compliments the flavors wonderfully, is to spread on the crust a layer of raspberry jam. Skip dinner go straight to dessert.

This was very good! The only changes I made was using only 4 thinly sliced apples and that was plenty.  The next time I will cut down on the sugar, it was a little too sweet for our taste. If you like your apples really well done I would suggest cooking them partially before adding them to the cake.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit!  I read other reviews and made the following changes: made the cheese filling 1 1/2 size the recipe (used 2 medium eggs) and pre-cooked the apples 5 minutes in the microwave.  I think I used only 3 apples and had a few slices left over.  Next time I will use the same amount of cheese filling but will dice the apples instead of slicing them.  Another reviewer suggested this and I think it would help as even after pre-cooking my apples were difficult to cut with a fork.  I don't think dicing the apples will change the presentation because once the sliced almonds are sprinkled on top the effect of the wheel-patterned slices is diminished anyway.  Overall a great recipe!  Thanks!

Wow... this is delicious!  I ended up using only 4 granny smith apples, because that amount arranged in a nice pattern and seemed like enough.  I also baked it a bit longer than the recipe says to make sure it had set in the middle.  This is delicious!

This was great!  I made it for a Christmas dessert and got rave reviews from everyone.  It was perfect the way it was, I didn't change a thing (well, I didn't have any almonds, so I had to leave those off).  Some other reviewers suggested pre-cooking apples, but I did not do that. I followed the recipe as written and felt the apples were perfect.  Hope you enjoy this as much as we did.

I thought this was a pretty good cake.  I didn't really like the crust though.  Otherwise, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers.. I microwaved my 6 apples for 3 minutes before adding them on top of the cream cheese mixture.  I accidently put the almonds on at the beginning of the baking, and they turned out great.  It fed 5 people nicely.

Coincidently, my mother actually made the same cake earlier in the week but used cherries instead of apples. She absolutely loved that.

bake for 45 minutes instead of 35. the shortbread crust becomes much tastier, harder and easier to serve.

Much easier to make than I anticipated. Some tortes don't need a crust on the side, as they set firm enough. Given the amount of crust this recipe called for, I ran it up the side of the pan. It worked well, but I think would have been prettier w/o the crust on the sides.  I also used 1.5X the cream mixture. I did precook the apples a little first, which reduces the amount.  So if you precook the apples, don't reduct the number you use.  It turned out great & tasted wonderful.

I was excited to make this, and it was pretty easy to do,,but...The apples ended up not being done enough.  I was leary about putting it back in the oven because I didn't wan't to over cook the rest of the torte.  Any suggestions?

I was disappointed in the appearance of this and handling it. It tasted fine but the apples weren't soft after the 35 minutes of cook time, so I added another 20 minutes. It still was under-cooked. Tasted fine but fell apart when I tried to serve it. Anyone else have this problem? I didn't see any comments about adjusting the baking time but if I prepared this one again, I'd double the time at the lower temperature before adding the almonds.

Wonderful taste. Since some reviewers suggested that the apples needed some softening and I don't have a microwave, I put the apple slices and some milk in the oven at 175 degrees C while I was preparing the rest.
Definitely going to be repeated!

Made this over the weekend and it was great (husband had two pieces!)  I took advice of reviews and this is what I came up with:  Used the original crust but doubled the cheese filling while adding 1/4 tsp. of almond extract with 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I think the key to tender apples is slicing thin, so I used four large HoneyCrisp and sliced about 1/8" thick also taking time to arrange them as evenly as possible in a circular pattern.  I baked at 450 for 10 minutes and then turned oven down to 375 for about 40-45 minutes.  I covered Torte the last 10 minutes so apples wouldn't over brown.  We all thought the crisp/tender apples with the cheese filling was a terrific combination (if you want soft apples, make apple pie).  
Thanks everyone for the comments!

This didn't come out looking too pretty (and slicing it up wasn't pretty either) but it was devoured by everyone (I only got one bite out of it), so giving a 5 star.  only thing I did different was toasted the almonds a little bit beforehand.  Recipe will be a keeper.

This was excellent -- would highly recommend it. The only change I made was to follow the advice of others and sub almond extract for the vanilla in the crust. Plus I cut the butter in with a pastry cutter, rather than creaming.

Anyway, the presentation was great, as was the taste. Will definitely make again and again.

Very good.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and microwaved the apples for about 2 minutes.  I doubled all the rest of the recipe and used an 11in spring form tart pan.  I had to turn my oven down quite a bit and cooked a little longer, so not to scorch the top. It turned out wonderfully.

Delicious!!  I did microwave the apples as suggested, and doubled the cream mixture to make more layers.  So good, made it for Christmas desert and my family LOVED it!

This was a wonderful not-to-sweet dessert (and breakfast item) that was easy to convert to a gluten free recipe.  The only change was three large apples (2 Gala and 1 Golden Delicious) and baked in a 9 inch square pan.

This was one of the most beautiful desserts I've ever pulled off.  Only change made was a sprinkle of brown sugar over the top with the almonds. Delicious!

Great recipe, me husband loved it. Definitely cook the apples some before assembling or else it is difficult to cut neatly.

I would have given 10 stars if possible.  Great!  After reading the reviews, I did precook my apples just a bit on the stove and pre-baked my crust for a few minutes.  It came out fabulous!  I used Granny Smith apples.  I will be making this again soon.

This was really good! I cut back on the apples as suggested by others (I used 4) and I cooked them for 3 mins, at 1 min intervals, on high, stirring after every min. Turned out great! We served it with home made vanilla ice cream, and it was fantastic! :)

Super yum! After reading people got crunchy results with their apples I decided to peel, slice and cook my apples in some water before I used them in the recipe. I cooked the apples until they were soft but not mushy, then I let them drain in a colander. Once they were very drained, I added the sugar and the cinnamon. This turned out really, really yummy!

This is delicious!  I cooked it a tad bit too much, while trying to get the almonds to look toasted.  Maybe that's why it fell apart a little.  I will most definitely be making it again!

This is amazing! Tastes almost as good as the ones I had in Germany. The only difference is that they use quark which I find is milder and softer than cream cheese, still delicious though! I didn't change a single thing, although I did find that 3 apples was enough to cover the top of the torte. I plan on trying variations using pears or raspberries as toppings. The only suggestion I have is to not pack down the crust as much as I did as it makes it a little on the chewier side, the edges however turned out with a better texture and consistency. This one is going in the recipe book! Thank you!

I'm amazed at how easy and quick this was to put together, the only change I make was using fresh pears. My DH was in heaven all I heard was yum you can make this again, delicious. I had a tiny peice and liked it too, thanks for the recipe. Next time I may double the cream cheese layer:)

I adore this recipe! It's a delicious alternative to apple pie. You MUST, however, cook this at the temperature advised. I tried to put one in with a roast at a lower temp, and it was just soggy mush. Delicious, but soggy mush.

I simmered the apples with the sugar/cinnamon until they were soft.  I recommend taking this extra step otherwise, your apples may end up being too crunchy.  I also doubled the cheesecake layer.  I left out the almonds due to allergies.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it turned out wonderful.  Everyone loved it.

This was wonderful! I made the recipe as written except for omitting  the almonds only because I didn't have any. It was still awesome! I would make again and I think it would be great with other fruit as well. Very easy to make.

This is so good, a definite keeper. I didn't pre-cook the apples (Gala) as some suggested (in a hurry and forgot) but they turned out just fine. I made two tortes, one with the amount of cream cheese filling the recipe called for and one with 1 1/2 x that amount. Both were yummy- for me, the amount called for was perfect. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This dessert tastes as elegant as it looks-- and the preparation was was very easy.  I used Empire apples and precooked them.  Their tartness was a perfect match with the butter and sugar. I reduced the butter to 5 Tbsp and it was wonderful. A definite "make again"!.

I dont think there was a thing to change on this delicious recipe! My wife made it exactly as you had it, and it was delicious. Granted, you can change the flavor of toppings or add chocolate and mix it up there.. but in terms of proportion and the base ingredients... perfect and delicious. We made it 4x in the first week...AWESOME!

Folks loved this- fancy, without being difficult. The hardest part was peeling and cutting all the apples. We used sweet and tart apples, but next time would skip the tart ones.

This was so delicious and so pretty! I don't think I've ever made a prettier dessert, this is definitely the one I'll use to impress! I used Granny Smith apples and it only needed 3 of those because they're huge. I sprinkled a little extra sugar on top to counter the tartness of the apples but I don't think it was necessary. In the future I think I will double the cream cheese section--it's just so tasty! I did make this in my largest springform pan, it's probably a 12 incher--I might double the shortbread crust recipe next time too!

My grandmother made this for me 20+ years ago, and I loved it.  I to this day still make it, and it's is a requested item at any dinner I go to and is expected to be served at all my dinner parties!  Do not mess with the amounts and what you do and don't put in anytime I have tried to get fancy with it, it never turns out right.

Very tasty.  Apples do cook down so I would use 5 or 6 medium ones.  I also precooked for 3 min. as others suggested.  Top of apples were a little dry, I may cover with foil for part of the time to keep in more moisture.

This was very good. Easy, but looks fancy. Used 6 small apples and that was a perfect amount.

yummmmmy!
it was soo easy to make, and hard to mess up.  I used overripe, nearly dried up apples that had been lying around too long as well as a few fresher ones and it still came out fantastic!

This was good, but not great. I pre-cooked three gala apples with cinnamon on the stove before adding it to the torte. The flavors were good but not amazing. Mine was very flat because my pan was larger than 9". I think the crust could have been better.

Absolutely delicious Terri! I added a couple of eggs to the filling, and due to nut allergies, I replaced them with a crumb topping. Thanks so much!

I have been making this for years.  It started in high school, when I had to make something Bavarian for German class.  Little did I know it would be so popular.  When someone is having a party, they request this torte.  I make it every Thanksgiving and most New Year's Eves, but it is good any time of the year.  It *does* fall apart, some of the times when I make it, but who cares? It still tastes good. Once, I tried baking the crust first, to avoid this, and the end result wasn't as good.  It should be a soft shortbread crust.  The only changes I've ever made is to add brown sugar to the apple mix, and I rarely add the almonds.  It *is* a lot of apples, but I personally like it that way.  No one has ever complained, but I'm sure it would still taste good if you opted to use less apples.

This was so good. I can't believe how easy it was to make. The only thing I changed was I doubled the sugar in the cream cheese mixture. Wonderful! I also made it with fresh peaches and it was great, too. One thing, do not double the recipe. It takes to long to cook in the middle and will burn before it is done.

This dessert is awesome! I followed another's advice and used canned pears instead of the apples, and I doubled the filling. One other change is that i used 1.5X the crust. Delicious!  Everyone loved it. One problem that I ran into is the cooking time. At the end of the 25 minutes, mine was still quite jiggly in the middle. I ended up doubling the time the pie had to bake, perhaps because of the increased mass.  Definitely try this one, you won't be disappointed.

This looked beautiful...but the crust came out completely burned, I think 350 for the full time would have been plenty hot. Also, the cream cheese layer was not nearly sweet enough and I only used 3 very small apples.

Disappointment!  The crust never became crust but was mushy.  And the apple mixture has nothing to keep it together.  When you remove the springform pan it falls over into one big mess.  Don't waste your time.

Tried as written, splitting the apple layer and cream cheese layer.  Second time I doubled the cream cheese layer so it would be visible.  Made a larger torte and more servings.  Both times I used 6 cups of sliced Granny Smith apples--just the right amount.  Put the sliced apples into microwave about 4 minutes.  Quite a bit of juice came out the first time after sitting which I was afraid would make the crust soggy, so I poured some of it off and used later. While baking, the top apples started to look dry and used a silicone pastry brush to dab on some of the appIe juice and  covered loosely with foil.  In a glass measuring cup I made a glaze with any remaining  apple juice, adding water to get to 1/4 cup, 2 heaping tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter.  When about 10 minutes baking time left, I put in microwave  long enough to melt everything and used pastry brush again to dampen the apples and bake until finished.  The time I doubled the cream cheese mixture I did put a cake tester in the center to be sure the lower level of cream cheese was baked.  Definitely want to refrigerate before serving.  I topped slices with whipped cream.

I love this dish so much! It's my go-to for whenever I need to bring a dessert somewhere. The overlapping rings of apples make it look so pretty and garner lots of compliments. I find I need many fewer apples than called for here--2 big apples or 3 small ones is enough for 3 rings. And my best tip is to add a pinch of salt when making the crust--getting that tiny taste of savory adds to the rest of the flavors.

I made this to bring to dinner with friends (there were 6 adults and 5 kids). I wanted to be sure I had enough for everyone, so I made 1-1/2 the crust and filling recipe, which was absolutely perfect for my 11" tart pan. I kept the apples at the 6, which was also the perfect amount for the pan I was using (oh yeah, and I did microwave the sliced apples for 3 minutes before tossing them with the sugar/cinnamon mixture). This turned out fabulous! It was so pretty, and the taste was amazing! There were 3 teenage girls at the get together, and one of them made the comment to the other two "we need to go to Miss Kim's house for cooking lessons!" I'm sure it was because this dessert impressed! Will definitely make this one again!

Soooooo good. The crust was so buttery and tasty!!! I used a springform pan and the juices dripped out of the bottom causing a mess in my oven!! Next time i will make sure foil is placed below to minimize the mess.

This dessert is a winner--with elements of cheesecake and pie, what's not to love? I skip the almonds so that the layering of the apples is more visible, which makes the presentation lovely. It's always a hit when I bring it to an event.

As others have noted, you can use a few fewer apples than called for, and be sure to slice them thinly.

GOOD FAST EASY   We enjoyed this  I need to make again with a few changes for me.  Use  just smaller  than 9 by 13 pan. I found this  a little flat. All layers could be just a touch thicker.
Took almonds forever to brown then crust started to colour.
I will not worry about almonds as much next time or brown a little ahead. Still this was very good, fast , and I will definitely make again.      2nd time.    Using the 8 by 10  much better.
You notice the cheesecake layer better.

I found this exact recipe on Taste of Home,  it's a great recipe. I had a coworker request it for Thanksgiving & offered to pay me whatever I wanted for it! 
I inadvertently almost doubled the cream cheese (one of those big blocks you cut off what you need, I used what was left) it turned out to be a happy accident. I have also made it with pecans when I was out of almonds, still awesome.  It's a keeper. Not too difficult but a bit time consuming. Totally worth it. I also use whatever apples I have on hand at the time.

Excellent.    I love that it looks so elegant yet is so easy to make.    I used 4 quite large Fuji apples which I cut with an apple slicer, then further sliced each section into thirds.  On the advice of other reviewers, I microwaved the slices for about 1-1/2 minutes prior to mixing with the cinnamon.   I also used almond extract instead of vanilla in the crust, but next time I will halve the amount because it was just a tad strong even at just 1/4 tsp.    Wonderful dessert; I plan to make it for Christmas.

I've made this twice, and both times it got rave reviews.   I didn't microwave the apples as many have suggested, I just sliced them fairly thin and I had no problems with them being crunchy.    The first time I made it the almonds didn't  brown, even after more time than suggested.  The second time I browned the almonds separately and sprinkled them on top after the torte was finished baking.  They didn't stick well either way, so it didn't really matter.  The second one seemed to have more of an almond flavor.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and used half vanilla & half  almond flavoring instead of all vanilla and I liked that additional touch of almond.  Good recipe!

I will definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing this. I made a couple of additions though. I only added a bit of brown sugar for a little deeper flavor and I ground some nutmeg into the apple mixture. I think I might experiment with some of those fancy flavored cream cheeses next time, as well as bringing the crust up along the sides of the springform pan a little more to aid in serving.

Read many of the reviews on here to help with the recipe. I agree with increasing the filling mixture. However, I would have either cooked the apples stove stop or microwaved then strain some of the liquid from the apples as this made the torte somewhat soggy. Also I wouldn't reduce the crust recipe as it was the right amount (at least for the springform pan I used). Lastly since we were topping with almonds I put some almond extract in the crust which was delicious! Overall a very good recipe and would make again.

Unbelievable !  Made pastry in Cuisinart, made filling in Cuisinart  Used a little extra sugar all around  ;-)  Baked almost twice as much as recipe called for.  Used a lot of apples Slice thinner next time.  Improves with age.

Excellent taste, but time consuming, crust was mushy, and failed to keep form when cut. The filling just spilled out everywhere when sliced, which may have been due to having just dumped the slices in instead of arranging them.

I was actually disappointed with this dessert.  I am picky about apple desserts, but these apples were just barely cooked at all and super crunchy - made a mess when we tried to cut into it.  I will definitely use the crust recipe again, but the overall torte if I were to make it again I would sauté the apples in a pan first to almost done and then arrange them in the dish.  I do appreciate that I doubled the cheese mixture and layered it with the apples a few times because otherwise it would have just been a large amount of undercooked apples.  I also added more cinnamon than was called for which added a lot of flavor which would have been missing.

This was good, not great. I would rate it 3 stars but everyone else really liked it, so I upped it to 4. First off, I'm pretty sure this is a tart and not a torte. Second, I had to cook it maybe 20 minutes more than the recipe called for due to the apples being undercooked. At the point they finally were tender, bits of the crust were over browned. I do not agree with others saying there is not enough cream cheese filling. I think there is too much. If making again, I would make more dough for the crust as it barely went halfway up the sides of my tart pan. I would then probably just do a thin layer of cream, maybe 1/4 inch. I also made the cream with almond extract in place of vanilla which was delicious. Next, the apples need something more to meld them together. I would maybe make some sort of a paste on the stop by cooking them a bit with sugar, apple juice, and cornstarch. Jam or something would work too. I didn't like that the apples were just kind of sitting on top on the cream and would've liked it to cook with the other layers. It also needs something to keep the almonds in place. They just fell right off the slices. All of that aside, the tart did have good flavors and was well received.

Made it per direction, pretty good. Thin slice the apples and double the cream cheese filling, the best apple pie cheesecake I've had. Also good with pears as well.

Fantastic. I thought the 8" springform was perfect. Each step was easy and a perfect amount for a delightful fall treat. (Good for any time though) I added craisins which was nice. Came out of springform pan no problem after taking a plastic knife beforehand just in case. Never made a torte before and I will def. do this again.

The finished product is beautiful and tasty.  I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c if I had not taken the advice of other reviewers and pre-cooked the apples we would have been really disappointed by crunchy apples.

Looks IMPRESSIVE and tastes FANTASTIC. Used a deep pie dish. Prebaked crust 5 min. before adding the filling. Used a 300 gr. tub of lowfat cream cheese with two small eggs. Kept everything else the same. I think substituting with almond extract will improve it even further for my next one.

I would actually say 4 1/2 stars.  I think I may be able to cut the sugar a little bit but it was excellent.  Reminded me somewhat of a very thin cheesecake with a great crust.

Just awesome.  The only alteration I made was to have the crust come up the sides of my pan an inch, other than that, I didn't change a darn thing and next time I make it, the only thing I will change is how much I make...soooooo good! So very very good! Oh, and I used Granny Smith apples.  Yum!

wow!i just made one yesterday and boy was it good!:).my brother even said that i could sell it and that it was unique!and trust me, my brother is very picky,my mother also liked it and she's not a dessert eater too!up thumbs!:) i already ate two slices myself!:). The crust was good, i did change a few procedures, i did microwaved the apples like everybody else suggested but only for 1 minute, i also sliced the apples thinly since i prefer thin apples when it comes to pies and that way it won't stuff the cheese filling!i also pushed the dough to the sides because it was a lot for just the bottom of the pan and since i was only using a 8" spring form pan. I was only able to use 2 regular fuji apples, i didn't use the granny smith since the cream cheese already has a slight tangy flavor. I also drizzled the syrup produced by the apples, cinnamon and sugar on to:). this is really a great recipe and i did made a few tinsy mistakes and yet it was still perfect!so anyone can do this!:)great for impressing:)

This was excellent! I made no changes to the recipe, though I did put my sliced apples through a slicer to make them thinner, which made all of my apples fully cooked. I would recommend putting a layer of tin foil below the pan-the apples leaked through the springform pan. Otherwise it got raves from my mom, boyfriend, bestfriend and her 14 month old!

This was good, but I found it to be a bit dry, especially the apples.  I microwaved the apple mixture for 2 minutes before adding to the top.  Not my best dessert, even though it is good.

This recipe is heavenly.  I read reviews and the only thing I did do differently was to nuke the apples for 3 min. to ensure that they would be cooked all the way through by the end of the recipes stated times.  It was perfect and is a definite keeper.

Insanely delicious!  Definite keeper.  Everyone whose had it thinks it is incredible.  Sometimes I add a little extra sugar and 1 cup cranberries for a holiday twist.

I have to say, I'm usually a little skeptical when something gets such high marks - I'm a very picky cook and eater.  However, this one deserves all 5 stars!  It not only is delicious, but so so so easy to make.  I had my family-in-law over for Christmas and this got rave reviews.  My husband is begging me to make it again just for us.  The only thing I'd really like to point out is not to expect anything wildly different - it's basically a flat cheesecake with cinnamon apples on top, but don't let the simplicity deter you, it is so good.  Lastly I'll add that I followed some advice and used only 4 apples & put the apple mixture in a pyrex bowl and microwaved it on high for 3 minutes.  The apples were perfect, not too soft nor too crunchy (I used Macouns).  Doing this did make the cinnamon sugar syrupy, so I didn't lay my apple slices out decoratively, I just poured it on/spread it out.  It still was very attractive.  Do make this recipe . . . you won't be disappointed!

I made this cake for a Christmas party and was somewhat nervous about how it would "present" since it was my first attempt at making it.  I should not have worried just as those that critiqued the cake before had said - it turned out beautiful.
The cake tasted wonderfully also but I did make the suggested change by doubling the cream cheese filling portion and also used only 3 large apples which I first softened by cooking them for 4 minutes in the microwave before incorporating them into the recipe.
It was eaten so quickly and I should have made 2 cakes because I was only able to get 8 servings from my cake and no one thought it to be too rich at all.

Great simple crust, a new favorite! I like microwaving the apples, like suggested by so many, but be careful to not over-microwave them.

I loved this recipe! Thanks. 
I doubled the recipe with no problems. I took the advice to microwave the apples for three minutes, and it turned out wonderful The ladies that enjoyed it, loved the crust!

I did not double the apples, as it was indicated there were too many, however next time, I will use the amount recommended.

It was wonderful, and enough filling in it for me!

I got good feedback from everyone who tried the torte. I thought the crust was a bit soggy. The pie also had very good presentation.

Delicious dessert!! Agree w/ others to pre-cook apples in microwave because they are crunchy otherwise. Used 7 or 8 Granny Smith's piled high - they will sink once finished baking.  Have made twice & both turned out great.  Next time I'll try canned pears (per another reviewer's suggestion) - easier than slicing apples!!

Tasty but it was hard to tell when it was done. I did also pre cook the apples but they did still turn out slightly crunchy. Still a very nice treat.

Very good!  I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit.  Might have needed to bake a little bit longer - needed to set up a little more.  Was hard to cut without the apples sliding around.  Will definately make again.

This dessert impressed everyone.  It tasted as fancy as it looked.  My dad,  who is a very picky old fashion Italian  man asked me to make it again just for him.  So simple to make and not many ingredients to shop for.

This worked really well.  I found that 2 large apples, arranged in a spoke-type pattern over the top, was more than enough, however.  Rave reviews!  Thanks! :-)

I have made this at least a dozen times over the years--each times with rave reviews. Makes the home smell wonderful when baking and is even better the second day after refridgerated!  An impressive dessert for company! I often double the recipe and use a 10" springform pan.

I have made this torte twice. Both times my guests asked what bakery I got it from because it looked and tasted so good. However, the second time I added some of the juice from the sliced apples thinking it would add to the flavor but instead it made the center of the torte a little soggy. So- follow the directions and you won't be disappointed!

Almost just right.  Somehow the cream cheese mixture did't set up right.  It was cooked all the way but not creamy, almost curdled.  I suspect the apples.  Any ideas.  The crust is excellent I've been looking for a recipe like this forever.  Thanks

This is a TART, not a TORTE.  This has a very pretty presentation.  The crust was the best part of the dish (very buttery and tasted like a cookie).  However, the dish overall was bland.

Not bad, but I would change the amounts slightly - 6 apples was too much compared to the amount of custardy cream cheese mix - I ended up with a thick layer of plain sliced apples on top.

I'd make it with double the cream cheese mixture, and would add the apples first then pour the cream cheese mixture over top, so it will then settle down onto the crust.

The recipe is also good with half pears, half apples.
