I chose this particular recipe because of the added oil. I know that peanut butter cake has a tendency to be dry. The oil did produce a moist cake however, this recipe has some problems. First of all, this is a recipe that produces TWO 9 inch round pans. If I had used all that batter for an 8 inch pan I would have had a major mess. Secondly, I added 2 additional tablespoons of peanut butter for more peanut flavor. I also decreased the vanilla and only used 2 teaspoons. The batter was incredibly thin so I also added another 1/2 cup flour. I was pleased with the final product but it certainly took innovation.

I found this cake to be very bland. It was nothing special to say the least. I doubled the peanut butter in the cake however I could still just barely taste it! Perhaps it was so bland because I didn't make the glaze. In general my family finds that frosting or glaze overwhelms a dessert and makes it too sweet but perhaps with this cake the glaze is just what it needs.

This cake was very good. I was impressed with the outcome a moist and delicious sweet cake. I thought that with the amount of sugar it would be too sweet but it proved me wrong. Although I doubled the amount of peanut butter the recipe worked perfectly for me.

as written I don't think this cake would have had much peanut butter flavor at all. I took others' suggestions and doubled the peanut butter. I also found the batter quite runny as in a previous review so added 1/2 c extra flour. maybe I should have added more oil too.. because this cake turned our really dry and crumbly. I used some chocolate chips also & baked in a bundt pan. I did do a peanut butter glaze and melty chocolate for some color & added flavor - without the glaze this cake would have been inedible. I was very disappointed as it was a birthday cake for one of my best friends - and now I owe him another.

I made this cake by the recipe except I used 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of the 2 tbps as shown in the recipe. I also did not put in a 8X8 pan. I used 4 round cake pans to make the layers thin. I cut the cooking time and made sure to remove before overcooked. The frosting took more milk to make it the consistency more to my liking. This made a very good cake after these modifications.

Made for daughter's birthday. I did not use the amount of vanilla extract recommended. Got some while in Dominican Republic and it is so strong that I have learned to use less only 1/4 teaspoon. Cake took longer to cook than recipe stated. It was really good quick and easy.
