Make sure you use 2c. cereal crushed, not 2c. of crushed cereal! I lowered the oven temp. to 325 deg. and that was perfect. Next time I will cut back on the amount of sugar.

These were so easy to make and so good!  The only change I made was to bake for only 9 minutes.  What a great way to use the last of the corn flakes in the box!  Thanks, Kathie!

This was a wonderful cookie , I did adjust some if it. I added a half cup more of corn flakes. Depending on how sweet you like your cookies, I would adjust sugar to 1/2. Will keep making thanks so much for sharing.

This is an excellent recipe.  Very easy and it turned out great.  We liked these cookies so much we made them several days in a row.  

Also, I used Special K cereal instead of cornflakes and added about a teaspoon of coconut extract when I added the sugar.

Will certainly make these again -- thank you for posting this recipe!!

I used Corn Chex since we are a gluten free family.  I also used 3 egg whites instead of two.  They were super yummy!

These were really good, I like that they didn't spread out much while cooking. I also liked the light texture to these for something different.

I've been making these cookies for years from a recipe handed down from my grandmother.  Basically the same receipe, but we didn't crush the cereal.  Best if baked on parchment paper or silicone sheets for easy removal.  Always a favorite with my family and friends.

The mixture was very crumbly..it fell apart before I could even get them on the cookie sheet to bake.   So the next batch, I increased the egg whites to 4 and it turned out perfectly...even the flavor was very good.

Really quite easy and I love the crunch of the corn flakes.  Merengue tip - let your egg whites warm to room temp before whipping.

When I made the recipe, the batter did not stick together. It tells you to bake for 18 min. but I only put 10 and the macaroons were burnt. There is way to much sugar in the recipe. There more like cookies than macaroons. Would not recomend at all.

This is what I was looking for. Excellent and no added fat recipe.I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup as I was using sugared cornflakes. Dont let them get browed-they turn hard.I did not have flaked coconut so used dessicated one and they still turned out fine.

So, I made these over the Christmas '11 weeekend and again today.  The first time, I followed the recipe for most part, except I left out the cereal. I didn't have any cornflakes.  Toward the end of the batches, I decided I wanted more coconut, so I piled more in.  The next time I made the recipe, I doubled the eggs, left our the cereal and used a whole bag of coconut.  I did not quite double the sugar.  Oh, both times I also added vanilla.  I liked the results well, so I give the recipe a 4 star rating more or less as a base for jumping off.  Next time, I may use some vanilla and some almond extract for a twist.

Simple to make but I found using powdered sugar instead of the granulated sugar was just the right sweetness and kept the fluffy texture. I also used coco rice crisps instead of the cornflakes, it added a wonderful light chocolate/coconut flavor!  I really didn't follow the recipe, since I used 3 egg whites and 1 C of powdered sugar, so I added as much coconut and rice crisps as I felt it needed.  I also baked these at a lower temperature (325) since I was also  baking meringues and they turned out fine

Awesome!  A definite hit in our house.  The only thing I did differently was after beating the egg whites to stiff peaks, I beat in the sugar for several minutes then folded in the cornflakes and coconut.  Also, I added some white chocolate chips- very very yummy! I have to make another bath today because these just flew out!

So simple to make!!  And wonderful to eat!  I used Almond flavored Honey Bunches of Oats cereal, and added 1/2 t almond extract and 1/4 t cinnamon to the egg whites while beating them.  They were wonderful.  As soon as I put them on the rack to cool they were gone!  I didn't even have to get a plate to put them on...they never lasted long enough!

The texture was good.The flavour was someone flat, it tasted okay but could have used some acidity, chocolate, or bold tasting nut to heighten the flavour and make for a more exiting cookie.

This is very much like MY grandma's macaroons, and OMG I loved them as a kid.  My kids loved them while they were growing up also.  She added a tiny bit of salt and a dash of almond flavoring, but I usually skip the almond.  And she wouldn't use metal pans -- she greased paper grocery bags.  I don't know that it makes a difference, but to this day I get paper bags and make them like grandma!!  Then throw the 'pans' away.  I bake them in a lower temp and a tad longer.

Very good cookie recipe!  It is not a macaroon, but it is gooey and coconutty, and that's all that matters tonight!  The only thing is I followed the 18 minutes @ 350 degrees...WAY TOO LONG!  Cookies were too dark and crunchy, but still yummy. I had some leftover cinnamon sugar from another recipe, and used that..it was good!  Next time, I will be trying one of the other suggestions about adding almond extract.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was far too sweet even after I cut the sugar in half.  It didn't have the right texture to be a macaroon.
