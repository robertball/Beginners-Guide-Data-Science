I really like the flavor and texture!  Reminds me of those Cotlets candies.  I bet any flavor of jam/jelly/preserves could be delicious, as well as any combination of nuts but I did use apricot/walnut this time.  My pan size was a lot smaller than this recipe suggested, so rather than make my dough rolled extra thick, I just did five thin layers of dough instead of three.  Also, I put both a thin layer of apricot followed by a sprinkling of nut mixture on top of each layer of dough.  The end result was so pretty with the stratified layering effect and various hues of golden color.  I'll definitely be making this dessert again sometime.  p.s. I did not have sour cream, so used plain yogurt instead and it seemed to work great.

This Torte was absolutely delicious.  I found that it tasted better several days after I baked it.  This Torte keeps wonderfully without going too dry.  Will definitely bake again and again and again.

I hve been making this recipe since I was 13. It's a favorite of my fathers. I use either two jars of apricot preserves or 1 jar apricot and 1 jar pineapple preserves. The pineapple helps with the tartness of the apricot. I tried blueberry as well as a strawberry version but we like the apricot/ pineapple best.

Tastes amazing and impressive looking!  My Grandmother used to make this recipe, I had bits and pieces of her old recipe but not the entire thing.  So I tried this and it was just as amazing as I remember her cookies years ago!  I used more apricot preserves, 2 - 12 oz cans.  It’s  a fancy cookie that tastes as good as they look!  It’s worth the time to make these!

Fam favorite for many years. You can use jam for both layers if nuts are not an option.

Sorry for being the minority here but we did not want seconds of these.   Although, it was very beautifully layered and presentable.
