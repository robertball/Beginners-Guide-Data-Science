My family loves this bread! I customized it for my bread machine to make one loaf (6 oz. of evaporated milk, 2 tbsp. water, 2 tbsp. 2 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. honey, 1 tsp. salt, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups bread flour, 2 tsp. bread machine yeast). I also added 3 tbsp. of cracked wheat for extra texture. Delicious !!!

Delicious!  Made this with the KitchenAid and it was a snap (kneeded on "2" with the bread hook for about 5 minutes).  This bread took a long time to rise at first so I turned the oven on at 400 degrees for one minute, turned it off and put the bread in the oven.  It rose very quickly.  Did the same for the second rise.  This bread is easy to make and delicious.  I will make this again and again!

This is the best wheat bread recipe I have ever tried.  I made it "as is" with wonderful results.  The second time I increased the honey to 1/2 cup, increased the yeast to 3 tsp, and added 1/2 cup oats, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup milled flax seed and 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.  My husband raved over this, my 20 m.o. daughter said "yummy", and I smiled knowing how healthy it is for them.  Thanks for such a delicious and adaptable recipe.

Ever since I started making bread by hand, I've tried a lot of recipes. I tried Kristin's honey wheat bread and was very, very impressed at the flavor and texture of the loaves her recipe produces. I love this recipe so much that I looked for more by her, and found the equally good Blue Ribbon White Bread recipe. Now, I use both Kristin's recipes for all my daily loaves. I do recommend using bread flour instead of all-purpose. It works much better for homemade loaves, and greatly improves the bread, especially in texture. Also, I now use melted butter instead of shortening after I fortuitously ran out of Crisco one day and had to substitute. Thanks for both recipes, Kristin!

First of all, I have to admit, I'm really not a fan of homemade bread.  The recipes I have made in the past have all resulted in a dense, dry, tasteless loaf of bread...until now!  This is by far the BEST bread I have ever made.  I comes out soft and moist and full of flavor.  I now make this bread about every other day.  And, the best part is that it can be made in the bread machine!!!!!  All I had to do was to add all the ingredients according to manufacturer's directions and set it on the dough cycle.  When cycle is complete, remove dough and place in a buttered loaf pan.  Cover with a damp dishtowel and let rise for 1 hour.  Then bake according to the directions.  Comes out PERFECT every time!!  This one is hands down a keeper!!

I had to add more flour than it calls for, and it makes two medium loafs.  I do not use a pan, but make rustic loafs out if it and the crust is so good.  I also add some 7-grain cereal from the bulk section of the health food store.

Tracey, it definetly sounds like you need to be kneading longer.  I used to have the same problem and was surprised at how long you really need to knead!  I do it in my Kitchenaid mixer for approx 7 minutes if that helps.

For those who have said the loaf is too dense or didn't rise well, please make sure you are using fresh bread flour and active yeast (quick rise is preferred for this recipe) in warm, not hot water.  Also knead the bread until elastic (about 8 minutes in a Kitchenaid or 10 by hand).  When elastic, it will be glossy and the bubbles on the surface will stretch and break.  Roll and shape the loaf tightly to eliminate a center air pocket.  Let rise in a warm and moist, not hot area before baking. When done, cool on a rack.  Finally, do not cut the loaf until cooled.  This should give you a less dense texture.  Continue experimenting - bread making is an art that changes daily due to moisture content in the air and flour.  You learn it through trial and error.  Enjoy!  Kristin

This is probably the best basic bread recipe I have ever made. I did double the yeast and used canola oil for the shortening. It is a very moist, tasty bread and it stayed fresh for day 2. I don't there will be any left on Day 3, so I can't say how long it will stay fresh. It is a very easy bread to shape into loaves. I am not sure what makes this bread better than the rest, but I don't think you will be disappointed. I am going to experiment using even more whole wheat.    UPDATE: I have continued to make this for two years now and just love it, as does everyone I make it for. I now add more whole wheat flour than what is called for. I typically use half whole wheat and half white. This week I was out of evaporated milk and for the first time I used skim milk. It came out every bit as good. I was always afraid to try the skim, thinking that it was the evaporated milk that made this recipe so good. Now that I know regular milk works as well, I will be doing that in the future. For those new to baking bread, you need to know that flour is an estimate. I have used from 4 3/4 cups to 5 1/2 cups with this recipe. A lot does depend on how much moisture is in your flour. I continue adding flour just until the dough is no longer sticky. With the Kitchen Aid Mixer that usually means the dough is not sticking to the bottom of the bowl.

Very nice bread. It's light and moist and easy to  make. I have to leave my loaves in the oven a bit longer than recommended to ensure that the middle isn't doughy. Delicious!

I read all the reviews and was really hoping this bread would work out. It was light and tasty, however, it took forever to rise, and the loaves were small.  Maybe it was how I prepared it???  I will try it again, and hope for better results

This recipe was SOOOOOOOO good!  I made a few changes and it still turned out amazing!  Instead of using a mixer, I just let the yeast rise a little in the warm water in a large bowl.  Then I just added the rest of the ingredients, turned out the dough on a floured surface, and kneaded for about 10 minutes.  I let the dough raise for about 1.5 hours, I let it get a little bit bigger than double.  Then I punched down the dough, formed into loaves, placed in loaf pans, and let rise about another 1.5 hours.  I baked the loaves for 20 minutes at 375.  They came out perfect!!!  Thanks for the recipe!
Addendum:  Recently I have tried this recipe with all white flour and it turns out just as good.  You just have to add a little more flour and knead the dough for a little bit longer.  I have also used cream, regular milk, and half and half instead of the evaporated milk, all with good results.  Instead of the honey, I have used corn syrup, white sugar, and molasses, each of these works well also.  This recipe is very versatile, try using different milks or creams, and different kinds of sweeteners.  I also add 1 egg to the recipe to make the bread a little more dense.

This is a great bread.  Here are some tips that might help: As long as you knead this dough long enough (7 min or so,) and allow your yeast to proof till foamy, there's no reason not to use ALL WHOLE WHEAT flour rather than combining it with bread flour.  And don't add extra flour prematurely -- the flour really works itself in the longer you knead and the stickiness goes away.  I just let my KitchenAid do all the work (on low speed.)  I didn't have to add gluten in order to get a light, fluffy, bakery quality bread.  Using all WW flour makes the bread so much healthier!  I allowed my bread to rise in an oven set to "warm" with the door open.  Also, if you're not using pre-measured, enveloped yeast, .25 oz = 2 1/4 t yeast.  I replaced the shortening with melted butter, but left off the 2T called for as a glaze (it really isn't needed.)  One other suggestion - bake at 350 rather than 375; maybe my oven runs hot?  Delicious!!!!

Can you give a recipe 6 stars?  This bread has a silky texture and stays moist for several days.  It is excellent toasted, and works equally well for sandwiches.  Because milk and whole wheat flour combine to form a complete protein, we often enjoy this bread with a salad or veggie soup for a light supper.  I am not able to use my food processor (KitchenAid Pro 670), but my KitchenAid stand mixer works well with 10 minutes kneading time.  I also find that I need to cover the loaves with foil so the crust doesn't get too dark.  Two variations:  Potato sourdough starter in place of the yeast was fantastic; and my survival nut hubbie made acorn flour to replace the wheat flour in this recipe with STUNNING results.   After more than a year of making this bread at least twice a week, I have never had a bad loaf.

Wow! What a great recipe for wheat bread.  This is the first 'make it at home' wheat bread winner that I've ever made.  I don't use a bread machine for the baking step although I did use one for the kneeding.

If you like making your own bread you should really try this one.  By the way, I buttered my pans and then 'coated' them with sunflower seeds.  It gives the bread a little more character and makes it come out of the pan in a snap!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I had to add a little extra flour, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  My husband and kids usually balk at wheat bread because "it's too dry", but they ate both loaves of this in one day, and begged me to make more!  It is really soft textured and has a wonderful flavor.

very delicious bread. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used buttermilk then added a little baking soda. The bread rose fluffy and light even though I used 100% whole wheat/flax meal & rye flour. For those of you having trouble with your wheat bread rising: One very important ingredient to add when you are making whole wheat bread is wheat gluten flour. 2T's in your dough makes it light and fluffy. I use Red Mill. I stopped buying store bread quite a while ago and I'm always on the look out for another never fail bread recipe that the kids and husband like. This recipe made 2 big loaves that are wonderful sliced for sandwiches and toast. Thanks!

This bread is outstanding.  I've made it a few times now, and it has great taste and texture, not bland or heavy.  I add approximately 1/4 cup extra honey.  The last time I made it, I added 1/4 cup wheat germ, which turned out great too.  Next time I make this, I am going to try replacing all the honey with maple syrup, to make Maple Wheat Bread!  I think also some other additions such as oats, other flours such as rye or rice, and seeds such as sunflower, pumpkin, or sesame might be good to try too.

Absolutely delicious! And I don't even like wheat bread! Soft and flavorful with a hint of sweetness. For yeast bread recipes you should use non iodized salt. Iodine affects the yeast activity which slows down the first rise. (fyi- citrus peel and cinnamon have the same effect!)

I love this bread, I made this for the first time for friends as a sandwich bread, very very good.  The only change I make is to use canola oil instead of shortening, because shortening is very high in trans fats, and does not contribute anything special to the texture of this bread like it does to biscuits, or other pastries, I have also made with just regular milk when I discovered I was out of evaporated milk, also came out great.

I really like this bread.  I followed the recipe exactly but it took quite a while to rise.  For the first rise it took about 2 hours and the second time a little over an hour.  The crust came out nice and chewy and the middle is soft, flavorful, and kind of dense.  Make sure to brush the crust with butter after taking it out of the oven so that it doesn't get too hard.

This was my first time making bread, so I followed the recipie exactly and it came out very 
heavy and doughy. It didn't rise very much at all- next time I will let it sit longer. It tasted good toasted, though.  If you knead it more, does it come out lighter?

I made this for the first time and absolutely LOVED it!  I make a LOT of bread, and this is by far the best bread I've made for sandwiches, and the best tasting bread to eat alone.  I was out of shortening and substituted margarine instead, and it still turned out wonderful.  THANK YOU!

I think this bread is wonderful.  I didn't have condensed milk, so I used half-n-half, which worked fine.  However, I had problems using my full-sized food processor.  Before the dough formed a ball, the dough became too thick for my machine to process it well.  I ended up kneading it by hand, and will use my Kitchen-Aide next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This bread is *wonderful.* I love to bake but have never had much luck with bread. The crust is always too thick and hard and the inside is gummy. This bread is different. It tastes like it came from a bakery. The crust is soft and chewy, and the inside is light and fluffy, even though it's a wheat loaf. I made the following changes:  *double the yeast and added 1/4 c. brown sugar with the honey *used half butter and half margarine for shortening *added 1/4 c. ground flax seeds & 1/4 c. wheat bran *added 1/4 c. oats to dough and scattered oats on top of loaves before baking.  Definitely will be using this over and over!

This is a really wonderful bread recipe.  I have made homemade bread several times before, but this is now my favorite.  The result is such a soft, light bread rather than the very dense bread you often get when making bread at home.  The only change I made was to use melted butter instead of shortening.  I used my stand mixer with the dough hook to do the mixing and kneading and it worked wonderfully.  This is just a delicious bread!

This has been my all time favorite bread recipe since the first time I made it in 2003. The bread tastes great as is, but sometimes I like to add 1/2 cup each of sunflower and flax seeds. I always add vital wheat gluten to improve the way the bread rises. I let the bread machine knead the dough, then I bake the loaves in the oven.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday, and I don't know if I measured one of the liquids wrong or it's just the sheer humidity (I live in the tropics), this dough turned out wet!  I used an electric mixer, and after combining all the ingredients it looked more like a cake batter than a dough.  I added several heaping tablespoons of flour and the bread turned out great.  I also followed the advice of others and used almost twice as much yeast -- I used 2 teaspoons instant yeast to half a recipe, and boy did the dough rise quickly! Because of these additions, I ended up making 3 small rolls in addition to my one loaf (remember I only made half the recipe). This bread's texture was heavenly after coming out of the oven, and I'm looking forward to the sandwiches I made for lunch today.

Bread Machine owners- I cut this recipe in half and made it in a bread machine set to basic and it came out great. Also, since evaporated milk is just milk with 60% of the water removed, the suggestion by others to just use regular milk in lieu of the evaporated milk makes sense. But I found the leftover evaporated milk was just wonderful for my coffee. Healthier than half & half.

A good, reliable recipe.  Nice and tender from the milk and subtle sweetness from the honey.  I used a little more wheat flour than white flour for a darker loaf.  I brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with whole flax seed for color and texture before baking.

This is a great and versatile recipe.  Those having trouble with rising times - make sure you're using Rapid-Rise Yeast (rather than Active-Dry).  This makes a really tasty, soft loaf.  I've played around with the flours and still had great results.  I had run out of whole-wheat flour so replaced it with a cup of wheatgerm and a cup of soy flour.  Oh, I also replaced shortening for butter (just personal preference).  I made the dough by hand (not with food processor).  Takes a good ten minutes to knead, but still gives excellent results.  Thanks!

WOW!!! I'm so proud of myself for trying this recipe. I've never made bread before so I read thru the reviews first for any modifications/tips. I too used 1/4 melted butter in place of shortening. Like others I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook on power 2 for about 8 mins. My tip: I had to do dishes so I loaded the dishwasher and ran it during the 2nd rise where you need a warm place to put the bread to rise. I placed the pans on the counter above the dishwsaher. The dough seemed to double in about half hour without a problem. If you've got apple butter on hand try some of the bread while it's still warm.. YUMMY!!! Thanks again!

This recipe is Fantastic! I must admit that I did change a few things though. I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp (salt kills yeast naturally and 2 tsps would kill a whole packet of yeast, I believe that is why people were using two packets vs. one) I used 1/2 cup of honey (raw,unprocessed from my local Farmer's Market). Instead of shortening I used 1/4 cup softened real sweetcream salted butter. I increased the whole wheat to 2  1/2 cups, Bread flour to 3 1/2 cups, used 5oz evaporated milk and 7oz of powdered milk reconstituted(directions for that on powdered milk container). I also omitted the sugar in the yeast proofing process and used a Tbsp of honey (it's naturally sweeter and the yeast like it better!). And I baked it at 350 for 35 minutes to keep the bread moist. It is a great starter recipe that can be changed to a person's tastes! Also I bake bread every weekend and the slow rise is the way to go! It keeps the bread sweeter and let's the yeast do it's thing. This recipe did take a lot longer than the 2 1/2 hours it says, but you can start this in the morning, run your errands, punch it down, separate, form loaves, do some more errands and it will be ready to bake when you return! Thank you for a great recipe!

a quick easy bread that doesn't require a bread machine - i like that -- a good 5 stars - i will definitely make this again - i would like to note that i used butter instead of shortening - and all purpose flour instead of bread flour - and 1/2 the fat evap. milk -- great texture - not too sweet -- tastes like store bought -- good stuff!

Followed recipe as written except used butter flavored crisco and a tad more honey.  I bought myself a new kitchenaid mixture, did a little dance in my kitchen I was so happy and then proceeded to immediatly make this bread.  Easy to make.  Smells wonderful.  My boyfriend came home from work and proceeded to eat 90% of the first loaf in one evening!  He raved about it!  No more store bought bread for him!  He took the second loaf to share with a co-worker the next day.  The following day the co-worker asked if there was any more bread because his son had eaten the entire portion taken home (except the one slice he had managed to nibble at before his son got ahold of it).  The son wanted to know where he could get more of the beast bread he had ever eaten!  I have never made bread before but I will from now on!  I am making my third batch in 2 weeks this morning.  My kitchen smells wonderful!!!!

Excellent recipe.  I have been making homemade bread for 30 years and this is the best whole wheat bread recipe.  The bread turned out light and very moist.  The only change I made was I combined all the ingredients at one time in the bowl of my KitchenAid Heavy Duty mixer and mixed it for about 8 minutes.

Delicious, easy bread. I used traditional yeast and allowed my loaves to rise overnight. I also sprinkled flax seed on top which stuck nicely to the butter. Very good loaves, highly recommended.

I tried this recipe the first time and it turned out great.  I doubled the honey and put a bit more flour the second time.  I tripled the honey the 3rd time and a bit more flour.  It was awesome!!!  This was great sweet bread for dinner rolls that didn't need any butter.  It makes up so quickly in my Viking mixer. I like to put it in my warm(not hot) oven to rise.  It goes real fast doing it that way.  I have also made cinnamon raisin bread with this recipe.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing.  I think the key to this recipe is letting your yeast rest the first time for the full 15 minutes in warm water.

This is a great recipe. It's so yummy. It's easy. And from other reviews you can see how versatile it is; subst milk for evap milk, changing whole wheat to bread flour ratio, subst the type of flour you prefer, add more/less honey for your taste, etc. 

In two days, we've made four loaves and they don't last long. Today my kids, ages 8, 6, and 4 have asked for more bread. We had store bought in the pantry and no more homemade bread. When they saw what bread was left they asked for something else to eat. They didn't want store bought bread. And they usually will eat slices by itself. Also, my kids are not picky eaters. They try everything I give them - spinach to asparagus. For them to pass up store bought honey wheat bread - not generic, and totally choose something else to eat says something.

Try this recipe. You're gonna love it.

Very tasty.  I substituted canola oil for the shortening as suggested by other reviewers, and it turned out great.  My whole family loves this bread.  I will be making this again and again.

As suggested by others, I doubled the honey, and added a bit of molasses, and also doubled the yeast, and added a small amount of wheat bran, and used rapeseed/canola oil instead of shortening.

As others have said, it is wonderful bread, with or without the extra honey/molasses.

The only complaint I have (with the original recipe) is the amount of time it takes.  Don't try this unless you have a bread machine, or a free evening.  The kneading is really a pain, but a bread machine makes it a lot easier.  I've now tailored my own "quick version" of this recipe (using bread machine for mixing/kneading), and it works ok in the bread machine, but it's best if you do it all by hand.

I usually add 50% to the recipe, so as to make 3 loaves.  If you really are going to do all this work (by hand), I suggest that you make at least 3 loaves.  I've increased my rating from 4 to 5, because I've now tried many many wheat breads, and this is my favorite.

i had to change this recipe around quite a bit but it turned out great! i didnt have bread flour or wheat flour so instead i used all unbleached flour and added in 3/4+ cup of wheat germ. i also added around a cup of old fashioned oats. i also used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/4 like it asks for. it probably couldve used more honey though.  i used 3 teaspoons of yeast like others had advised and i strongly recommend it. the last change i made was instead of shortening i used butter. thanks for the recipe!

This bread is so delicious! It has such a wonderful light, fluffy inside as well as a great crust. The only change I made was to use butter flavor crisco for the shortening.  I didn't have any problems with the bread rising, since I let it rise in a warm oven. Thanks for the recipe; I will be making this again and again.

I've made this several times, adapting it to my bread machine. I use: 3 t bread machine yeast, no sugar, 1/2 c warm water, can milk, 1/4c butter, 2 t salt, 1/3 c honey, 4 c whole wheat flour, 1 c bread flour. Let the bread machine do the work, split the dough between two pans, top with melted butter, let rise in the oven (proof setting), bake for about 20 minutes. I've given it as gifts and been asked for the recipe. I still need to work on getting even rising. I may not be kneading enough before putting it in the pans. Thanks for the recipe Kristin!

Outstanding bread!  I used butter flavored shortening and made no other adjustments.  When the loaves came out of the oven, I used a lot of butter to coat the top.  Just plain awesome bread!  The first loave was gone in 30 minutes.

10 stars!!!  I loved this!!!  And it wasn't hard to make either!  It does take some time, but most of that is rising time.  I made it all by hand (instead of the food processor, because I was scared mine couldn't handle it!).  I used melted butter instead of shortening because I don't eat partially hydrogenated oils.  It worked well.  Like many other reviewers, I made one loaf and 12 rolls.  Baked the rolls 17-20 minutes, I think.  Dont' forget to butter the tops, it adds so much flavor!  This was easy to knead and it rose well.  I always let my bread products rise an hour the first time, and 45 minutes the second.  This seemed to be a really good time.  (I let it rise next to my warm crockpot).  Served with Slow Cooker Beef Stew I.

This is the perfect recipe.  I have made it several times.  Sometimes I have subtituted 12 oz. milk for the evaporated milk and omitted the 1/4 C. water, and it turned out great.  I also use 4C. whole wheat flour and only 1C. white to make it more healthy (I use white wheat which is lighter tasting than red, I don't know how red wheat would taste).  My kids (2 & 4) love it and my husband loves coming home to a warm loaf of bread on a cold winter evening.

I've used this recipe several times; its the closest i've found to the bread my mother made for us when i was a child; just a bit sweet, slightly dense.  I do the first mix step with a paddle mixer for a couple minutes on my KitchenAid; then another 30 seconds to incorp the yeast.  Flour gets added a cup at a time, using the kneading hook; then i let the hook go 5 minutes.  This dough is /very/ sticky if you are not kneading by hand (which adds a little more flour in) you'll be tempted to add more flour, don't.  Once the first rise finishes that super sticky texture goes away.  This dough does take a bit longer to rise (i'm not sure the cause), i normally give it another 10 minutes on each rise (done on top of the stove top, covered in a damp tea towel with the oven on 325, do NOT put it over the vent(back left hand burner), you will cook your dough)

My wife is an excellent cook.  She protects her kitchen, like it's a Momma Only area. I applied for the appropriate pass and clearance to bake this bread and it paid off big time!  We both love it!

Momma said it has 'the YUM factor".  That is truly high praise.

If you're going to go through the time and effort to make bread, it has to be better than what you could simply go to the store and buy.  This bread meets and exceeds that standard.

There's nothing more wholesome and satisfying than home made bread.  The aroma is wonderful and it's pretty to look at too!

Oh, I didn't get a full time kitchen pass though.  Momma says the bread is so good, that we both will grow to the size of a compact car if it's available all the time.  But, she did ASK me to make more on Christmas Eve.  She wants to serve it to family with Christmas dinner.

OMG this was sooo good. I made 2 batches (4 loaves) last night and invited some friends over to try the bread and tell me if the recipe was a keeper. They all LOVED it 9and tried stealing my loaves!). My changes to recipe were I made it without bread pans, and baked them just on a cookie sheet in round, country style loafs. I also used salted butter instead of shortening, used 1/2 cup honey AND also made my own honey butter to baste (when it was done) and serve on the slices. It did take a REALLY long time to rise and double in size for both sets, but the end result was AWESOME. I will be making this weekly. No more store bought bread!

Awesome Sandwich Bread! I changed it a little- Used melted butter instead of shortening, added an extra cup of white flour, and doubled the honey quantity. I'm not an expert bread baker by any means, and this turned out perfect. Will definitely make again.

Followed this almost exactly - just added 1/4 cup more honey because I like it sweet. I should have omitted the 1/4 c water because of that... but I didn't and had to add more flour.  It took a LONG time to knead in my Kitchen Aid (because I kept having to add more flour), and a long time to rise (in a warm oven).  But it was worth it. I got one perfect sized loaf and a pan of rolls with perfect texture and taste.  Highly recommended.

This bread was awesome! Mixed the ingredients in the bread machine first and baked in the oven. Turned out perfect! Even made some hamburger buns and they turned out great as well. Husband and my 2 year devoured one loaf in just 2 days! Thank you so much for the recipe.

Talk about heavenly bread!  I read through numerous reviews as I like to read tips from others verses reviews that did not alter the recipe and the results of both.  I incorporated certain revisions like adding ½ cup of honey and made sure that I used the rapid rise yeast and not the one that I use in my bread machine.  Used my bread machine for the initial mixing, then unplugged it for the 15 minute wait time (I went by my bread machine directions of adding all liquid items first then the sugar (I used Splenda), flour then added the dry yeast.  After the 15 minute wait, plugged the unit back in (dough setting was used) and proceeded to let it go the course which includes the initial rise of the bread.  Punching and rolling out the dough thoroughly is essential otherwise you will have huge holes in your bread.  Going by another reviewers tip, I checked the bread after 20 minutes and it did need the top to be covered with foil (was already browned enough).  Covered the tops and continued baking for 10 additional minutes.  I can taste a slight taste of honey but would have preferred a bit more.  Still with some butter, this is the best wheat bread I have ever had and even the top is soft!  Some say it’s just like store bought but I believe this to be far superior, store bread is gross which is why I never buy it.  This will now be baked weekly and one loaf will be given to my mother on a weekly basis.  4 stars since I used 1/2 cup of honey & Splenda but it is five star taste!

I like to add extra honey and use less butter.  This bread freezes really well.  I like to make a few batches in advance, roll into a loaf after the first rise then freeze the dough.  Then I can take out the dough and let it rise overnight and have fresh bread more often without all the work.  Overall, this is excellent bread.

This is the first bread recipe I have done and during the process I realized that I had Active Dry Yeast instead of the RapidRise Yeast.  In reading a few articles online, makes me wonder what type of yeast the other people rating this recipe are using since so many say they had to double the yeast.  My bread turned out excellent but I did have to let it rise much longer than the recipe states.  It was also important to make sure to "proof" the yeast until it got creamy.  You do not need to proof your yeast if you are using the RapidRise.  I'm excited to try this with the yeast that's stated.  Like others have stated, this is a very forgiving recipe. Will definitely be making this again and again!

absolutely scrumptious!  this recipe yields bread that is tops in flavor and texture.  I love it that this bread stayed moist and tender even after i forgot to put it in the bread box right after it cooled down enough to be stored. my hubby swears that this rivals the wheat bread he has always bought from a popular bakeshop. needless to say, he won't be buying their bread anymore. :-)  i did tweak the recipe a bit -- used canola oil instead of the shortening (since that was all i had) and added some oats to the dough during the mixing process. I used a stand mixer with a dough attachment to do all the kneading.  after shaping them to go into the loaf pans, i lightly oiled the tops and rolled the loaves in some oats -- they turned out so pretty after they've baked.  i also had to cover the loaves loosely w/ foil halfway thru baking just so they won't get too dark.  overall, a winner!  thanks for sharing!

This is very good bread...I used my Kitchen-aid mixer to knead the bread...I had to add almost 4 cups of flour before the dough became smooth and workable.  I had no problems with either rising and it baked up so pretty...my whole family liked it...I know it will be requested again soon...thanks for the recipe

Based on help from other reviewers/ mentors, I've successully baked bread, without a bread machine, with this recipe!  I replaced the melted shortening with melted butter; doubled the yeast; kneaded for 30 minutes(!); had to let it rise the 1st time for 90 minutes, and the 2nd time for 60 minutes (could be my climate?).  It turned out great.  The water pan in the oven gave it a slight little crunch on the outside, and the inside is soft.  Thank you, Kristin!

Wonderful taste and texture.   It did seem a  little to wet to begin with, but as I kneaded the bread adding flour to keep it from sticking it came together.   It was an excellent bread.

Excellent bread. I replaced one cup of bread flour with 1/2 c. quick-cooking oats, 1/4 c. ground flax, and 1/4 c. wheat germ. It gave the bread a nuttier flavor. I also punched the bread down a total of four times, letting it rise overnight. In the morning I put the dough in the pans and let them rise for 45 minutes. I baked them for the full 35 minutes, and they turned out perfectly. Thanks, Kristin, for a wonderful recipe!

This was the best wheat bread I have ever made--And I started making bread as a young girl!!  It had an EXCELLENT texture, soft and light with a flaky crust.  My daughter even loved it and she does not like any kind of wheat bread. This is now my staple bread recipe.  It was great for sandwiches--slices easily.  I placed half the dough in mini bread pans and braided the dough--it was great as dinner rolls.

Very nice!  
Finally, a wheat bread recipe that's easy and makes the right amount (2 loaves).  I used my bread machine on Dough Cycle for 15 minutes to mix and knead the ingredients and I substituted Canola oil for shortening and it came out very moist and creamy tasting.  
I've had bad luck with other wheat bread recipes on this site but I can see why this one is a blue ribbon winner!

I've used this twice in the past couple weeks and it's now my go-to recipe for bread. My only change was to use homemade grade B maple syrup instead of honey simply because I don't have honey on hand. I've given the second loaf away to friends and they are both clamoring for more. Absolutely delicious and the texture is superb.

I made this 2 months ago and it was teriffic.  I just made it again and it turned out great.  I made it in my bread maker, just for the dough setting to mix and knead & raise once, then I punched it down and divided it into the 2 loaves and let it raise & baked it 28 mins.  Very flavorful and easy to mix up.  Kudo's Kristen.

I have made this recipe twice and it is phenomenal!!  The loaf bakes up high and it is very soft and tasty.

I have baked this as loaves as well as rolls and it was a hit both ways.

Even my picky daughter who usually only eats white bread loved this!!

I made without a bread machine and it is truly wonderful.   Followed the recipe exactly at first and then subsequently I made the following procedural changes for ease of baking; these do not compromise the quality in the least, as far as I can tell.  I put all the ingredients into a Kitchenaid Mixer with kneading hook (I do add the yeast [it doubles in size before I add it] after the other ingredients are mixed thoroughly).  I cover the bowl with a damp towel and put in my oven that is preheated to warm (about 125F).  I use a 20X22” (could be larger if I had one) cutting board (wood) lightly dusted with bread flour and a buttered rolling pin (non-stick finish).  I roll out all the dough at one time (I don’t punch it down first) to fit the board.  I use a pizza cutter wheel to cut the dough in half.  Roll up each half and put into the buttered pans.  Put both pans in the same warm oven with the damp towel on top.  I preheat the second oven about 15 minutes before second rise is finished.  I probably could shorten the amount of time for dough to rise because of the warm location, but I don’t mind waiting.

really tasty.  Had to add more flour because my dough was really wet and had to knead FOREVER... but the crust was a great texture and the taste is fantastic... especially if you spread a little honey butter on it.

Overall, pretty good, but I would recommend some changes.  Add a few tablespoons of honey and use half the salt. The salt was totally overpowering and you could barely taste the honey.  It was easy enough to make, though, and it works to substitute butter for the shortening and skim milk for the evaporated milk.

I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will add more honey and yeast. I am an experienced baker and the dough took nearly 4 hours to rise. It's a keeper, but only with modifications.

This recipe is fantastic! I just started to bake bread from scratch, and this recipe is easy and yummy! It is very moist, and keeps well. I didnt have any shortening the first time I made it, so I substituted butter instead and it turned out great! I recommend this recipe over any of the other wheat bread recipes. I tried several before I found this one!

It's easy to understand why this is a 5 start recipe & a blue ribbon winner.  The bread was awesome!!  Per my brother-in-law who is the "official bread maker" in our family (their oven went out, so I tried my hand for Thanksgiving)--the flavor was excellent with a superb texture.  He said he very seldom likes wheat breads--so that's the ultimate compliment.  The recipe & directions get kudos too--I do a lot of baking, but my last bread making attempt was years ago & a total disaster!  This turned out so well that I'm ready to try more--thanks for a delicious recipe w/ fantastic instructions for the inexperienced!

Fantastic. Cooked VERY Fast so be sure to pay close attention. I added extra honey and sifted the flour. Cooked them on a flat pan and they came out beautiful. I'm saving the second loaf for a friend and had to hide it because my mom threatened to eat it.

This bread has become a hit not only in my home, but in my firends' homes!  I have changed it a little bit.  To get sweeter wheat bread, I use 1/4 cup condesned milk diluted in 120z of water (both water and milk should equal 12oz),  since I grind my own wheat (Prairie Gold), I use four cups of wheat and one cup of bread flour.  Instead of shortening, I use 1/4 cup of oilve oil.   Simply delicious!!  I get nothing but praise when I bake this.

I warned up the evaporated milk and threw all of the wet ingredients in my bread machine, then the dry ingredients and lastly the yeast and set it for the "dough" cycle.  I then shaped it, let it rise and baked it in my regular oven at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.  It was moist and really good!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bread.  I quit using the bread machine because it is SO much better by hand!  Recipe is delicious as is, but I tweak it to make it healthier.  I use 3 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour.  I also add 5 TBSP vital wheat gluten to improve texture, and usually 1 or 2 TBSP flaxseed for added nutrition.    I have found that it needs to rise longer than written, so I pop it in a warm oven for a couple hours for each rise.  Don't let it rise too long though, or it will get really hard!

This is the best wheat bread recipe I've found.  Even my husband likes it (he thinks most are to heavy, or crumbly).  I put  in whatever extras I have at the time, flax seed, brown rice, sesame, poppy, walnuts, almonds, sunflowers, etc.  It always turns out perfect!!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it 4 times now and have only made two small changes. First I add 1/3 cup of honey second, I use active dry yeast(because it's what I have) I let it rise about 1 hour 2o min. for the first rise and about an hour for the second (I put a small pan of boiling water on the bottom of the oven and shut the door to rise) I have to bake it for the full 35 min. so the bread is not under cooked, because of this the top seemed to burn before the bread was done. Now I check it  at about 10-15 min to see if the top is brown and place a piece of foil over the top to prevent further browning. Everyone loves this bread! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm in my 8th month now of making my own yeast breads. For a sandwich bread, this is hands down the best recipe I have tried out of about 8 or 9 now. As others recomended, I subbed olive oil for the shortening. I also threw in about 2 tablespoons of wheat bran. It was pretty easy to make, but like most yeast breads, also time consuming. But so worth it. Delicious. Husband, who always likes my breads but has recently confessed to missing having Wonder bread (or whatever brand) around, says that's no longer an issue. This bread is perfect for sandwiches and toast. Tastes great. Excellent texture. My compliments and gratitude to the person who shared this wonderful recipe with us.

I made this recipe with the following adjustments/specifications : substituted applesauce for the shortening, kneaded by hand, and ended up adding more flour during the kneading (I couldn't tell you how much though).  As well, I broke it into rolls and baked it into a pull apart loaf.  It came out nice and brown on top, and moist inside.  It was very good.

This bread is awesome right out of the oven or toasted. My boyfriend made a toasted ham/swiss and tomato sandwich with this bread and he said it was the best sandwich he ever had! I like it toasted with butter sugar and cinnamon-it beats eating a sweet roll was the wheat is very good for you! I also added 1/4 C of milled flax seed to mine for an extra kick of healthy stuff! Will make again soon. The first batch is almost gone after 4 days!

This is an awesome recipe. I substituted canola oil for shortening and added a bit more honey as suggested by others. I had to add more flour to make it manageable. I sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Everyone was impressed with the outcome. My sister said it looked like it came straight from  the bakery! Thanks!

WOW! This turned out amazing. Great recipe!My first batch failed as I added REALLY hot water to the yeast later finding out I killed it.Whoops.... 

2nd batch---beautiful! I made one loaf-12 buns. I added very finely chopped fresh rosemary to some of the buns and it was wonderful and fragrant.I will make this again!
No other changes to the recipe.

This bread was pretty good.  When it came out of the oven, the ends were perfect.  I should have cooked it more because when we got to the middle, it didn't taste very good anymore.  It also took almost double the time to rise as the recipie said it would.  I think I will find a different bread recipe to make frequently and probably won't make this one again.

This is a delicious wheat bread-- My kids ate a whole loaf!  I forgot I didn't have any honey and made a substitution from sugar and water-- it still turned out fabulous.  I kneaded mine with a dough hook on my kitchen aid mixer for about 7-8 minutes on speed 2.  It was perfect.  Thank you for the recipe...

This was the best wheat bread I ever made.  It did take longer than expected to rise, but it was well worth it.  I made it for Thanksgiving and got many compliments on it.  It has been added to my recipe box so I am sure not to lose this one.  I also tried the white bread recipe by Kristin and it was delicious as well.

This bread has a richness due to the condensed milk.  I grind my own whole wheat flour and used whole wheat bread flour as the second flour.

Wonderful!  Easy to make and you can simply mix the ingredients quickly and let it go.  One thing I noticed, when you use instant yeast instead of rapid yeast, you have to plan in an additional 20 minutes for the second rise.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the instructions exactly using melted buttered flavored shortening. I lost track of how much extra flour I had to use, and I was worried that it wouldn't turn out right because of that, but it was delicious. Yay! The second time around, I omitted the extra 1/4 cup of water, used butter instead of shortening, added 8 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten (this makes the texture softer, and it is a now my secret ingredient for perfect whole wheat bread) and after kneading I put the dough in a buttered bowl, covered it with plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge overnight. When I woke up, I shaped the dough into two loaves and let it come to room temp and do the second rise. (The first rise happened slowly in the refrigerator and helps the bread develop even more flavor.) I bake at 375 for 25 minutes and the results were amazing!!! We go through a loaf a day. My entire family loves it. It's the best bread I ever ate.

Great taste but a comment on the directions. I'm a newby bread baker so specific directions are appreciated. Number 1 says to mix the yeast w sugar and warm water. I made the recipe the first time but didn't wait until the yeast had become activated - about 10 minutes after putting it w the water and sugar. Consequently, the dough didn't rise much at all. I was in a bakery and asked where I'd gone wrong and he explained the activation process. So give your yeast, water and sugar a good 10 minutes to get foamy and bubbly. Also, the rise times seem short. I'm making this recipe again today - because even tho the first batch didn't rise, it was delicious - and the rises worked better at one hour each - maybe even a little longer. Otherwise this us an easy mix and a great flavor. And now that the loaves are well above the tops of the baking pan, the consistently should be better.

I debated on whether to give this recipe 3 or 4 stars.  I guess I would say it's a 3 1/2...
It was good, but not spectacular.  I was expecting more from this recipe.  I was looking for "WOW" kind of moment.  It really was lacking something, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Stand alone by itself is was just OK at best.  With butter on it, it was better.  As toast it was good.  Although it was an easy recipe, I am not sure I will make it again

Excellent! It is truly delicate and soft. My variation is to use olive oil in place of the shortening and all wheat flour. I usually need at least another 1/2 cup of flour to get the right texture. I have also added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal. Really good!

Made this for dinner guests - and it was awesome! The smell, the texture and the slightly sweet taste are perfect.  

It didn't rise as much as I expected (maybe I didn't have my warm water temperature right). I also subbed 1 stick melted butter for the shortening.

My changes : I used 1/8 coconut oil 1/8 real unsalted butter in place of the shortening and 3 cups wheat 2 cups of bread flour 1 1/2  teaspoons of salt.
I made this as the test loaves before using it for Christmas dinner.  It was very soft and rich quite a bit different than my tired and true Betty Crocker honey whole wheat I have used for over 20 years.  I am making more tomorrow for our meal I will use a  full 1/4 cup of coconut oil instead of shortening and 4 cups of wheat flour and the full 2 teaspoons of salt.  It was really yummy I am excited to try it again

I have never made bread from scratch before and honestly, this bread was INCREDIBLE and SO easy for a beginner. I did go out and buy a thermometer so that I could make sure the temperature of the water was correct so the yeast wouldn't die. I also tried adding oatmeal on top before baking, which made it look even better, but unfortunately it didn't stick, so I will need to work on that. I may increase the honey a bit next time to make the bread a tad sweeter. Also, I did not use Rapid Rise Yeast. I used just the standard Active Dry yeast since the way the recipe is written, it seems that is what the writer meant. Rapid Rise apparently is just added directly to the dry ingredients according to the package? But that's only what I read. I will DEFINITELY be making this bread again! And it tastes WONDERFUL with Peter Pan Crunchy Honey Peanut Butter on it! I highly recommend this recipe for any beginners out there like me! :)

This bread is delicious.  I have made it a few times now and gotten the best results with these changes: I doubled the recipe, using 10 cups freshly milled flour, used 3 tsp yeast, buttter instead of shortening, skim milk instead of evaporated.  I added a tsp of gluten, and added the salt during kneading.  I also added flax seed & ground flax during kneading. This made two large loaves.  I may not have baked it long enough (40 min), so may need to increase the baking time if I find it not done in the middle. Otherwise, turned out perfect.

I followed the modified directions for the bread maker.  It came out fabulous! I'm going to add sunflower seeds next time for some texture.

I have baked bread for years and was bored with my old recipe.  I tried this one and now my family thinks that they are too good to eat bought bread anymore!   It is the best bread I have ever made!  It has a wonderful flavor and texture.  Slices great for sandwiches and toast!  It would be great for beginning bread bakers to try.  I added more honey because I like a sweeter bread and added some time on both of the rises.  The first time I made the bread by hand and the second time I used my Kitchen Aid Stand mixer with bread hook.  Both batches turned out great.  You do not need a bread machine or stand mixer for this bread to turn out great!!

After reading most of these review, I knew I had to try this recipe.  Oh, my!  So Good!  I am an experienced bread maker and have made some lovely loaves over the years, but this is the tastiest bread I have ever made.  I have been looking for bread that has this flavor for a long time, and this is it!
*Note, I put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  Then put in loaf pans and rise in the oven on my bread proof oven cycle.  I also doubled up on the honey, which most people recommend.  Yummy!

Wow- I can't believe it. This recipe is outstanding- you could open a bakery and be proud to serve this! I used the bread machine to mix it, but did the second rise and bake in a 9x5" loaf pan. Here are some changes I made- used only half the recipe, added 1 T extra of honey, and 2 1/2 T of vital wheat gluten. I poured water, yeast, sugar, milk and let the yeast proof. I added the rest and let the machine do the rest. My husband looked at it and went "Oh no- did you make this in the bread machine?" (we've had super doughy, heavy breads when I bake the bread in there), but he really loved it after he tasted it!

Wow!  I see why everyone has rated this so highly.  The dough goes together easily (I did it manually, using my Danish dough whisk).  The only things I did different were to use regular yeast because that's what I always use, and I forgot to put the water bath in.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband was also very impressed.  This bread will be in my regular line-up of bread recipes.  Thanks, Kristin!

This was a great recipe.  The loaves were light with just enough sweetness. I read the earlier reviews and found that this did take much longer to rise than recipe indicates.  It was worth the wait.

This bread is beyond delicous. It does take awhile to rise. Using the oven is about the best way to do that like previous posts suggest. Great taste and texture! I will make this bread again!

I've made this bread for my family every week for the past month.  I make the whole loaf in my bread machine and it comes out PERFECT every time. I was a bit cautious about the amount of salt in the recipe, but 2 tsps is fine given the size of the loaf.  First, I dissolve the yeast in the sugar/water mixture directly in my bread machine pan.  Then I add the rest of the ingredients in the order listed in the recipe.  All the ingredients fill my bread machine pan about 3/4 of the way, but that's fine. I pop the pan in the bread machine and set the machine on a whole wheat setting.  About 5 hours later, I have SOFT, YUMMY honey wheat sandwich bread!  It's so exciting!

PERFECT!  I have tried more recipes than I can count and I have FINALLY found a soft wheat bread that doesn't weigh a ton and instead is actually light and airy!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I followed the bread machine suggestion. Used whole wheat bread flour and regular unbleached flour and this came out great. Also added several tablespoons of milllet, ground flax and sunflower seeds. Yum!

This bread is absolutely delicious! I had trouble getting it to rise, but the amount of oven spring was amazing. It came out perfect. So don't be afraid if it does not rise as much as you think it should, it will most likely spring up in the oven. I might however, recommend halving the amount of salt in the recipe.

This bread was WONDERFUL!  I had to add about 1.5 cups extra flour though because the dough was too wet.  I made the dough in my bread machine and made two med. loaves.  So moist, delicious, and easy!

This is the perfect wheat bread recipe! I used butter instead of shortening because of one reviewers suggestion. It was light and airy, and not dense at all. Made a beautiful loaf. It took a while to rise, but that may have just been the cold day. I will be making this again for sure.

Followed the recipe but added a 1/2 cup of honey instead of a 1/4 cup---what a fantastic bread--came out perfect.  My DH loved it!  Thank you for such a tasty recipe--I will be using this again and again!  Updated: I froze one of my loaves and though it wasn't as enjoyable as the fresh one, it was PERFECT and better than any other bread for french toast.  I will make this often!

Perfect!  Will cut the recipe in half next time.  There was too much bread for just two people.  Put in the bread machine on dough setting. Dumped into buttered loaf pan, covered with wet towel for 1 hour and threw it in the oven according to instructions.  Super easy.

I started to make this in my Quisinart and almost burned it out!  Switched to the Kitchen Aid stand mixer and then ended up kneading it by hand.  I only changed it to 1/3 cup honey.  The end result was DELICIOUS!  I let the second raising go for an hour.

Great results. Made the following changes as others suggested to make the second batch better than the first attempt. Added 1/4 c. wheat germ, used butter instead of shortening, added more flour (about 1/4 c.) when kneading, doubled all the different times required for raising the dough, heated oven 400 degrees for one minute for warm place to raised dough. I also used Pam spray to grease the bowl used to raise dough and bread pans. It is much easier. Use my hand mixer on low spead to add the 3 c. flour before kneading. The two loafs were great. Not as heavy as the first batch.

Although I love to cook and bake this was the first time I ever made homemade bread, other than in a breadmaker. I followed the recipe exactly, and my whole family loved it both fresh from the oven and a few days later. It was truly delicious. Considering the health benefits I don't know why anyone would make white bread from scratch when you could make whole wheat that tastes like this. My only other comment would be that going by the times suggested in the recipe, my bread didn't rise quite as much as it should have, and I did use rapid rise yeast. It may have been because my house is very cold! Next time I'll leave more time for rising.

For my first time making home-made bread, all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!! I had 3 couples over for a game night and served 2 loaves of this bread, and they all said it was the best homemade bread they have ever had!! It's no surprise that this recipe is a blue ribbon winner. Thank God for allrecipes!! :)

I let the bread rise for practically hours both times, covered loosely in a warm microwave oven. Perfect texture and crust. I think I'd add more honey next time. This recipe has given me confidence to try making more yeast breads without using a machine.

Absolutely delicious. I used molasses instead of honey.

Very good.  I was looking for something that would replace store-bought loaves and not be too dense or dry.  I used 3 cups wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour instead.  Also used 6 tsp vital gluten, increased the honey a bit, added about 1/4 c. ground flax, 1/4 c oats.  Will definitely make again.

This was the best bread I have ever eaten or made.  It was tender, just enough sweetness and delicious!  My dough was very wet, so I just kneaded in more bread flour.  Maybe it was the weather.  Other thn that, the only thing I did different was to sprinkle wheat germ on top of the bread before I popped it into the oven - just for looks.

This bread is really good but if you are looking for bread to make sandwiches with, try a firmer bread. This one is a little too soft. It still tastes good though so I'm still giving it 5 stars. A good sandwich bread is Dee's Health Bread on this site.

I've made this bread three times.  The second time I made it I forgot to read the instructions. Since I've been making bread for so long I just made it the way I always do.  BIG MISTAKE!  Letting the mixture sit for 15 minutes (I got busy the first time and it sat for over an hour. In fact I think the longer time made it even better) and putting the pan of water in the oven while baking are key to this bread turning out so wonderful.  The only thing I changed about the ingredients was increasing the salt to 1 tablespoon.  This will be my standard recipe for wheat bread from now on.  I will stock up on canned milk so I will always have what I need when the mood strikes to have bread right out of the oven smeared with butter.  YYuuuummmmmm!

This bread is wonderful, especially when eaten toasted with homemade Vegetable Barley Soup. Unlike other reviewers who had problems with the dough mixture being too wet, I had trouble getting all of the dry ingredients to mix in, which I'm sure had to do with several additions and changes I made to the recipe. My changes are as follows: I used fat free evap. milk, 3 tbs. wheat gluten, 4 tbs. sunflower seeds, 1/4 c. wheat germ, 2 tbs. wheat berries, 1/4 c. chopped pecans, 3 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of bread flour. Thank you so much for a great recipe!

This was, by far, the best bread I've ever tasted! The only change I made was to substitute canola oil for the shortening. It came out beautiful, moist, and slightly sweet. I made it completely by hand (no food processor or bread machine) and had no problems whatsoever. This was instantly voted a "keeper" recipe by my family. ;)

I halved the recipe and used a bread machine to bake 1 loaf. I made some minor changes because the first time I made it I found the bread a little stale the next morning. After the changes the loaf remained soft and moist the next day. 

Because I used a bread machine, I measured the milk and water together (total volume 250ml) and poured this into the pan. Then I cubed 40g butter and threw it into the milk followed by 3tbsp honey and a pinch of salt. Then the 2 types of flour goes in on top of the liquid mixture and finally the yeast (4g). I also added 1/2 tsp of bread improver (for white bread & sweet buns). I did have to remove this from the bread machine 15mins before the time was up because it makes a rather small loaf. So if you're using a bread maker you should check and remove once the crust is brown.

The taste is great and moist... and stayed that way.  The only complaint is that the recipe needs to give more direction on how to fit the dough in the loaf pans so they won't have a weird shape or so they won't divide after slicing.

This was the first loaf of bread that I've ever made and it came out wonderfully.  I actually thought I messed up the dough and put it aside and started over.  As it turns out, both batches came out wonderfully.  I took a loaf to work and it got rave reviews and several requests for the recipe.  

One batch was made with 1% milk, the other with evaporated milk and both came out equally as good.  Also, I don't have a food processor so this one is still easily done by hand.  I will definatley make this one again.

This is a good bread recipe.  This was my first attempt at making bread all by myself (my daugther helped as well).  It taste great, it took about 2 hours for the first rise instead of 45.  The second rise was right on the money, 30 minutes.

This will be great for dinner tonight, and I will make it again.  My daughter has a lot of food allergies, and I'm looking for a honey wheat bread sandwich bread.  I'll keep searching for that recipe.  I don't think this what she wants for sandwiches.

The first time I made this recipe I halved it to only make one loaf. Now I know why the original recipe makes two; it's awesome!! Bake for 30 minutes and be sure to brush the crust with butter when it comes out of the oven.

I love this recipe.  The bread always comes out delicious and moist.  Another great aspect of this bread is it is easily adaptable.  We like to substitute soy milk for the condensed milk and then leave out the water.  For some extra fiber, try substituting wheat bran for 1 cup of the wheat flour.  We also love to leave out the honey and knead in garlic, rosemary and and diced tomatoes. Delicious!

I've been searching for years for a good whole wheat bread recipe.  The first time
I made this bread, it was completely gone the first day!  My two-year-old son gave
me a huge smile and said "MMMMMMmmmm".  It really is perfect - slighty sweet,
chewy, and flavorful.  It has been about 6 weeks since purchasing a pre-made bread
from the store.  Fantastic recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I used active dry yeast, processed the dough with my mixer and a dough hook, added a 1/4 cup wheat germ and wow, what good bread.  The rising time is considerably longer with regular yeast but the wait is worth it.

This is a great bread.  I used the food processor and it turned out perfect.  I almost blew it though.  I scaled the recipe down to just one loaf and then forgot the instructions didn't scale-just the ingredient list.  I started over with new yeast and left the other stuff the same and still it turned out perfect.  Even found the shortening in the microwave-forgot to put that in. Must be a very forgiving product.  Try this one, you'll love it.

Outstanding!  The first time I made this, I accidentally added rye, instead of wheat, flour.  The results were delicious.  It is also great with the wheat flour.  The crust is just the right blend of soft/crisp, and the texture of the bread is wonderful.  It holds its shape for slicing, and is neither too dry, nor too wet.  Highly recommended.

My bread machine broke yesterday and I found this recipe to make the old fashioned way.  It was so easy and is so good I think I might let that machine sit in my closet a little bit longer before I get it fixed.

My family loved this one. We've been making our own loaf bread the past couple months and needed to find a whole wheat recipe to include since that's what we typically buy. This one is delicious. Tender, perfectly flavorful, and hearty too. After cooling, it sliced very nicely into sandwich sized pieces.

Came out very nice. I doubled the yeast though, considering our northwest cold weather. Replaced canola oil with shortening. This one is a keeper!

I sooo wanted to give this a 5-star rating. The taste is great but I had a heck of a time with the prep. I followed the directions as written, but the dough was very sticky--I was never able to form a ball even though I added more flour. I read the reviews and all the tips--applied some of them. I went ahead and baked it, and like I said the taste was great, but the bread was a little too dense. I live in the south TX region and it is very humid here so maybe the flour was moist? If anyone has some advice, it'll be very welcome :)

This is, by FAR, the BEST bread recipe I've ever followed. I was expecting a bread that would taste like the majority of my previously baked homemade breads: less than stellar. This bread is anything but boring. In fact, it's dense, full of flavor, sweet (honey) and hearty. It's not grainy or overly-heathly tasting. Instead, it tastes so sinfully delicious. I ate half of one of the loaves myself. It was THAT good. 

Funny enough, I forgot to add my yeast mixture until the last minute! So, I added it, had to add a handful of flour (all-purpose) to dry the batter, and it still turned out. No ingredient modifications on my end except for that tiny addition, and I seriously doubt it changed anything.

Two thumbs up!

The texture of the bread was nice but the flavor it was something that we didn't enjoy. Sorry to say it because we had great expectations for this recipe as the ingredients are quite good.

This bread was great! I thought it was going to be too sweet because of the honey, but it wasn't. I was concerned at first, because I had to add 1 cup extra bread flour before the kneading was done. That may have also helped with it not being too sweet. Mine was definitely more dense than the photo, but it was still soft also. I gave the rise time 30 minutes extra on both the bowl and pan rise. I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer to mix and knead everything. I did about 5 minutes on the kneading. Only other real change I made was using melted butter as opposed to the shortening and using Gold Medal flour white (whole wheat), as opposed to the traditional darker tinted and stronger tasting classic whole wheat. I also used 2% low fat evaporated milk and it did not seem to be a problem. I let it rise in a bowl I rubbed with a little corn oil and just sprayed the baking pans lightly with PAM. I did butter the top crusts both times, as suggested, and it gave it a buttery crispiness to the crust. ty

I have been baking bread for many years but I don't have a favorite. I am always looking for new recipes and this is a good one. Since I live in humid Pensacola, I was leery about the additional 1/4 cup water so I left it out and would add it if needed during machine kneading. Even without the 1/4 cup water the dough was pretty hydrated. I left it as is and added a little additional flour while hand kneading for a couple of minutes. I figured this will make the loafs a little lighter and I was right. If you live in a humid area, I would differently watch the water.

Wow - this bread is amazing!!  I am just learning to bake bread and I am following alot of comments.  I doubled the honey and yeast, kneaded the dough FOREVER, added a bit of flour til the dough wasn't sticky.  30 minutes out of the oven, and 1/2 a loaf is missing due to counter snackers!  THANK YOU, KRISTIN!!

I made this recipe the first time, following the directions exactly. The family loved it, but I felt like it needed something (even if just butter on the bread, which I don't always use on fresh bread). So I decided to try it again using molasses in place of the honey. It was the perfect Wheat Bread! It is my new standard bread recipe. 

I also prefer baking in rounds rather than loaves...I don't know why, but I like the look and the fact that you get bigger sandwiches this way. This bread is DELICIOUS!

Love how the milk gives this bread a great texture, smell and taste! I tried to knead by hand because the full batch is a bit too much for my mixture, but the dough was quite sticky. I didn't work with it a lot but it rose beautifully and the texture of the final product didn't suffer. Next time I'll let the whole wheat flour sit for a little longer to develop the gluten more. Thanks!

Amazing bread!!!!!!  Perfect consistency, taste and texture!  I followed a previous comment that allowed for bread machine instructions but I used a half and half mixture instead of evaporated milk.  Simply wonderful!  I'm about to make my second loaf!

Used olive oil instead of shortening. Did not add additional water. It was easy to make with a stand mixer. One question: when it says add "small pan of water"...how small and how much water? Anyone know?

I made this bread this morning, and it turned out fantastic!  Very crusty outside, and nice and soft on the inside. This is going to be a regular in my house.  One modification that I did: I did an egg wash, and then buttered it when it came out of the oven. Gave it a beautiful golden crust.

Just love this bread. So do my husband, 3 year old son and 1 year old daughter. Easy to make and delicious every time. I use 3 teaspoons of yeast to make sure it rises enough. Have to use our electric knife to cut it because no one can wait for it to cool!

I've been searching for a good wheat bread recipe.  This is it!!  The first time, it came out perfectly.  I'm going to try a little more wheat flour this time, just because I'm trying to cut out white flour.  Either way, this is my go to bread recipe!

Delicious bread! I had to make a couple substitutions: fresh milk and general purpose flour, but the bread still turned out excellent (just took a bit longer to rise). This recipe also works well as free form artisan loafs baked on baking stone.

My first attempt ever at making bread. This was a snap. I pulled one loaf out a bit early, so it was doughy in the middle (we suffered through it). Otherwise, it was awesome.

I really liked this recipe!  I made the dough in the bread maker by just putting in the order recommended by the machine.  Then I took it out, separated it, placed it in the 2 loaf pans (I do like oven baked better than bread machine), let it rise for 1 hour, and then baked in the oven.  It was fantastic with a great sandwich bread consistency for easy cutting and serving.  The only change I made (besides prep) was that I did 3c ww flour, 2c b flour instead of vice versa as recommended and I added 2 T of wheat gluten.

This bread turned out wonderful! It is so moist! I substituted 2% milk for evaporated, and butter for shortening. I also added about 2 tablespoons of dark mollasses. Next time I will double the honey for a stronger flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

I love love love this bread...I've done it just as the recipe reads, and got good results.  However, I live at mile high altitude and increase the temp of the water just slightly.  I increase the honey by a couple of Tablespoons and use an extra packet of yeast.

This is the recipe I always use with a couple of minor variations. I use butter for shortening and 2 1/2 C of each wheat flour and bread flour (definitely use bread flour-all purpose doesn't seem to do as well). Yesterday, I was out of honey and used molasses instead---IT WAS THE BEST BATCH EVER!!!

Easy and very good.  I don't think the evaporated milk made much of a difference though.  Next time I will try regular whole milk.  Yields 2 1 lb loaves or two 1.5 lb loaves.

This bread was wonderfully easy to make! Which I really appreciated, this being the first time I made bread. I did end up using al-purpose flour instead of the bread flour and adding in 1 more cup before kneading due to the dough being to sticky to really knead.

This is amazing bread!  I made one tiny change and used butter instead of melted shortening in the dough.  Besides that I followed the recipe exactly and I LOVE this bread!  My 20 month old daughter who is extremely picky ate an entire piece for breakfast!  I highly recommend making this bread.  I am not an experienced or accomplished bread maker either so for me to have such success really speaks to the accuracy and quality of the recipe.

The Best Bread Ever!!!!  I didn't read the recipe properly before I started, so I had to alter it a bit...I mixed all the flour and salt together before realizing the whole wheat flower goes in first and sits with the yeast for 15 minutes...oops!!:)  So I proofed the yeast first, then added the flour mixture all together and proceeded without waiting another 15 minutes...also, I added 1/2 molasses, and 1 cup of milled flax seeds.  The results are amazing! awesome texture, light and soft, crust is soft and delicious.  The flax definitetly adds a bit of a nutty flavor, it is wonderful, especially for toast in the morning!  I can't say enough about this bread!!

I have made this several times and really am grateful to have found a non-bread machine bread recipe.  I use butter instead of shortening and whole milk instead of half-n-half.  Thanks so much!

Yum! I will be making this recipe again and again. This is the closest to store-bought bread I have ever come; it is so moist, airy and flavorful. However I will say that like B. Gilbertson, I had to add at least 1.5 C more flour since the dough as is was too sticky.

Yum, this bread is so good.  My kids, who aren't crazy about store-bought whole wheat bread, absolutely love this. There's never a crumb left over for the next day. Easy and delicious, it's one of my staple recipes now, and it was only the 2nd "from scratch" bread recipe I ever tried.  If I can do it, anyone can!

I'm glad my husband bought the top-of-the-line Cuisinart food processor.  It did a great job of kneading this bread.  And the bread?  Probably the only wheat bread I'll ever make now.  You know how it is when you want the "perfect" recipe?  This, without a doubt, is the perfect honey wheat bread.  My husband, who doesn't care for whole wheat bread, thought it was the best bread I've made.  For white bread with an amazing texture try the Amish White Bread recipe on this site.  That is also amazing--especially if you use half the sugar.

So the first time I tried to make this I learned that patience is a virtue. The dough was sticky and it wasn't rising as I expected, but I baked it anyway. Needless to say the end product was completely subpar. But the next day I tried again. I added a little more bread flour, used 1/2 cup honey and actually let it rise (which was way, way, way longer than stated in the recipe) and the end product was beautiful. I must say, I was quite proud. Thanks!

I JUUUST finished this recipe and it TRULY is THE bread recipe I've been looking for! It's very flavorful and it's definitely sandwich bread! I doubled the yeast amount and was able to get 2 loafs and 12 dinner rolls out of it.  

For those new to making bread, the amount of flour might seem too little when you first start kneading it, but it works out perfectly in the end.

WOW!! This is better than any bread I've ever had. 

Changes I made for my own liking:
I used 1/2 C. of honey instead of 1/4.
I used a little bit more yeast (3 tsp altogether)

I added: 1/2 C. rolled oats, 1/4 C. wheat germ, and 1/4 C. of flax seed meal.

This is so amazing, I'm afraid I'm going to eat the whole loaf. Some body stop me!

I have never made bread before, and I was interrupted (had to leave earlier than expected for Thanksgiving dinner!) and let it sit on the stovetop rising for about 6 hours...then formed the loaves and let it rise again once back home.  It came out great!  I used butter instead of shortening, because that's what I had, and I forgot to add the evaporated milk before I added the yeast, but the recipe was indeed very forgiving.  Yummy bread, can't wait until  breakfast!

This has become our family's bread.  When everyone is home I find I need to make a recipe every other day.  I sub in up to 2 C oat bran flour for the white bread flour.  This recipe is so forgiving.  Even when I let it rise too long or not long enough, it comes out less than perfect but certainly still tasty.  It is such an easy recipe my college daughter makes it often at school.

This was more than bread... it was a spiritual experience.

I doubled the yeast & honey. Also, I added a butter layer a few times while it was cooking to develop a crisp crust.

It came out perfect.

This was excellent. I added 1 tbsp ground flax seeds, 1 tbsp oatbran, and 1 tbsp wheat germ for some added nutrition. I also brushed it with butter both before I baked it and after it came out of the oven. 
My entire extended family LOVED this bread.

This was my first time using my Kitchenaid mixer for making bread as my old bread machine finally gave up the ghost. I don't think I 'll be buying another bread machine any time soon as this recipe was so superior! 

I did use regular milk heated up to 110 degrees and used a little sugar and a touch more salt and it came out so wonderfully with a texture that just melted in our mouths. Try this recipe!!

This is the first time I've ever made yeast bread.  It turned out wonderful.  WONDERFUL.  I absolutely could not wait until it cooled to try it (in fact, it is STILL warm), and wow, is it ever delicious with butter.  And apple butter.  Or even plain.  Followed the recipe with a few differences:  Added 1/2 cup ground flax seed with the white flour and I used my KitchenAid to knead it w/ a bread hook on speed two for six or seven minutes.  I let the bread rise in a warm oven (I set it for 350 and once it reached that, I turned it off about 30 minutes before I put the dough in to rise) and for the initial rise I let it rise for about an hour, and the second rise for about 40 minutes.  It was the perfect height, color, taste, everything.  Light and airy, this bread is my new fave.

Great recipe.  Second time I tried it, I used 3 cups wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour, which was even better.  Used Canola oil instead of the melted shortening (better for you).  I gave it away to friends for Christmas gifts (with a jar of jam), and everyone loved it, especially because it was something healthy.

I first made this recipe by the book.  It didn't rise like I wanted it to.  Then I read a comment that I saved from someone else who used extra yeast.  I made the recipe again and made a few changes...1.  I used 2 packages of yeast.  2.  I used fat free evaporated milk.  3.  I added 1/3 c ground flax seed.  4.  I used canola oil instead of shortening.  Wowee!  It was great.  I made a grilled cheese with it over the weekend and OHMIGOD!  It was soooo good!

There is no competition: this is the best wheat bread I have found. This is also one of the few recipes I have ever found that is absolutely perfect exactly as written; every change I have tried has only detracted from this delightful bread. Just read, follow, and enjoy.

I am a novice bread baker and this was easy to make! The texture is great and I even messed up and used 3 c. wheat flour and 2 c. white flour (instead of the inverse which the recipe states). Great bread! Thank you for the recipe!

This was our second attempt at making bread. The previous recipe was too dense but this one is worked out really well especially for novice bread makers like us. The only issue we have is that it takes sooo long to rise (even at warm temperatures). We normally have to let it rise for double the time stated in the recipe. And the cooking time is longer than stated. Other than that, the bread is wonderful. It makes great toast after a few days as well.

This will become one of my favorite wheat bread recipes. The only change I made was to substitute butter for shortning. It has a lovely color, and suspect this it will keep well as it is so moist, but I am having a hard time testing that theory!

I have made this bread several times, and it is delicious!  The only thing I did differently is use melted butter instead of shortening.  This has become our favorite bread recipe!

My first attempt at a loaf of bread outside the bread machine and it was a hit! Really pleasant and mild taste. The texture is light and soft, but holds up well when slicing. I'll definitely be making this again. I used the dough hook on my Kitchenaid for about 10 minutes instead of kneading.

I have never made bread before, but this bread was easy to make & tastes so delicious.  In fact, the recipe says to wait until it cools to cut, but I couldn't wait any longer & it's delicious when it's warm!!  Wonderful recipe!

Very good and easy to make.  It was my first time making bread and thank goodness it was a success.  Next time, I'll try to experiment w/ different milks and more honey added to the recipe.

I wanted to try out a cranberry orange loaf of bread, so I substituted orange juice for the water in this recipe. I added about 3/4 c of wheat germ to the dough, as well as about 2 cups of dried cranberries and about a tablespoon of orange zest. I did everything else the same and I came out with two very tasty loaves of bread that were excellent with butter and honey or just some orange marmalade.

ok, i just made this and i have to comment that it is delicious. the reason i only give 4 stars is that i changed too many things. i didn't use evap. milk, but buttermilk instead. i used 1/2 c. melted margarine instead of the 1/4 c. shortening. i used about 1/2 c. honey, and added a little extra water to compensate for about a cup of rolled oats i added. YUM. i made 2 dozen buns - delicious!

This came out beautifully! Such a healthy and hearty alternative to store-brought bread, there really is a difference with homemade fresh bread. I used a cup of rye flour in there. This will be my official bread recipie!

YeeHaw!!  This is a fabulously easy and delicious bread.  I prepared it exactly per the recipe, making 1 nice loaf and a dozen rolls.  I'm sure I'll be making more before the week is out.  Thanks for the good recipe - it's nice to have home baked bread again!

Thank you Kristin!  I must confess, I have tried making bread with my bread machine, with my husband's assistance (who is very good at bread making) and on my own and have never been successful, until now.  I followed the recipe except used regular milk, butter instead or shortening and did the whole thing by hand.  This bread is GREAT.  Next time I will add more honey or molasses for more bite, but it is sublime the way it's written. Try it.

First off I would like to Thank Kristin for a fantastic recipe.Very nice texture it deserves 10 stars...I'm the kind of guy who can't leave well enough alone, so I added a few things a 1/2 cup cracked wheat flour, 1/2 cup rye flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon,1/4 cup molasses and 1 cup raisins. I made 4 round loafs, egg wash on top with a sprinkle of the cracked wheat flour.They we're done in about 14 min.Try it either way and your taste buds will danc'in...

I have made this a couple times and it is great.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used flax seed and oats to substitute for some of the white flour.  I also used soy milk and non-hydrogenated margarine to make it vegan.  It was excellent.  I have trouble keeping it for a few days because my husband devoures the whole loaf as soon as it is out of the oven!!!

We tried this recipes with a few changes- we used butter instead of the shortening like many had suggested, but we also substituted honey with barrel molasses- it was the best, most moist wheat bread we ever made and it was a holiday hit!  We also made a butter spread to go with it- Whip a stick of butter with 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 2-3 tbsp. of powdered sugar. It was great!

Very excellent bread.  Made 2 large loaves.  I didn't have evaporated milk, so used whole milk, along w/ 1/2 cup of dry milk powder swished into the milk.  Instead of shortening, used 1/2 c butter.  Also mixed by hand.  Mixing the whole wheat flour in with the liquids worked really well.  The loaves were light and fluffy, and raised really well.  I've had problems in the past with wheat bread not raising, but that is in the past now.  My hubby is making peanut butter toast as I write this!!  Very very good, Kristin.

Delicious.  I made this once with butter and once with shortening.  I preferred the butter.  I also increased the yeast a bit as the first time I made it I thought it wasn't going to rise.  I didn't have evaporated milk so used regular milk to replace the liquid (evaporated milk and water) in the recipe.  I took the dough from one "loaf" and made 9 small rolls instead in a 9x9 pan to make small sandwiches for my young children.  They declared this bread a 'keeper'.  Also makes great french toast!

Perfect, delicious, quick, and easy!! I put all of my ingredients into my mixer using the dough hook, which made this recipe even easier. The bread came out picture perfect and it tasted just as good as it looked and smelled. Make this bread and make your family feel special. This recipe is defintely a keeper!!

Great! This was the first time I've made wheat bread & was nervous about the result I would get. I used 1/2 each of the whole wheat flour (King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour) and 1/2 bread flour (Lily). I used the dough cycle and then put the dough in the buttered loaf pans to bake in the oven as a previous reviewer suggested. The texture is so soft and tender and it slices beautifully. Thanks!

WOW!!!  This bread is super!  I love the flavor and it was very easy to make, even without a bread machine or a mixer.  I did everthing the "old-fashioned" way and while it took  bit longer, it was well worth it!!  I also added a bit more bread flour because the dough was too sticky to knead. A+ in my book!!

This bread was delicious but took much longer to rise.  I t also didn't raise as much as I thought it should.  I'm not sure if it is supposed to be as dense as it came out or not.  It was light and good but dense.  Maybe this is the way wheat bread is supposed to be.

Except for the workout it gave my arm, it was a fantastic bread! The rising took longer (both times) and needed just a bit more flour for kneading, but it was absolutely delicious. The butter flavor was a tad strong eating it warm out of the oven, but all the flavors fell into place when it cooled.

I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and it still turned out fabulous! My husband said it was the best loaf of bread I ever made!

I took a bite of this bread, warm out of the oven, and thought, "bleck!"  However, the texture and flavor improved greatly upon cooling.  This is not a very bold-flavored bread, but it works nicely for sandwiches...(peanut butter and honey has been a personal favorite).

I wrapped the loaf in aluminium foil, and it has stayed moist for about 5 days and counting...but it may not last that long in your family...

This bread has a wonderful, soft texture and is very flavorful - even without a spread.  My 2 year old loves it too.

This is a quick & excellent tasting Wheat Bread.  My family loves it!  Sometimes I alter by cooking 1/4 cup cracked wheat in 1/3 cup water and adding to recipe!

I love this recipe! I made a couple changes as someone else who reviewed it did but didn’t go quite as far as they did. Maybe next time I make it. So here are my changes: used 3 tsp of yeast; 1/2 cup honey; 1/2 cup oats; 1/4 cup wheat germ; and I made it in three 4” x 8” loaf pans. 25 minutes and pulled it from the oven. It was yummy!

Wonderful turnout :0). Made one loaf and a 'free-formed' loaf the first time. Couldn't find other glass loaf pan due to kitchen reorganizing project. I also used unbleached, organic wheat flour (accidental: distracted by shiny object while shopping, happens). Second time used whole wheat flour (Translation: Left someone home, shopped alone, age, education, career doesn't always help with wandering & curiosity). Both times used one & one-half packets rapid rise yeast (~.38 ounces) A form of rise insurance. Also, the second time I made this, after punching/dividing I used one-half to make cinnamon rolls and the other half dinner rolls. (Out of necessity since the rolls accompanied a dish given to time-strapped dad and cinnamon rolls supplied him with fun, special, admittedly not the best breakfast option (whole wheat though, that count?) for his little ones). I don't rate recipes based on my changes/preferences i.e. added 17 different spices, used xyz instead of abc, cooked using a flat iron, etc. This recipe is a true keeper, deserving of five stars as written. New place has an electric oven (I cried). Since I'm used to the flexibility gas heat offers, let paranoia take over & broke baker's golden rule of rejecting urge to open oven to check progress. Bread still turned out better than I hoped for especially for first runs & inexperience using electric heat. Makes delicious sandwiches & after few days French toast. Don't make more than you know you'll eat. Thanks again Cheers!

My wife and I are bread novices but this recipe couldn't have been easier. Ingredients are simple. No running around for exotic or unusual ingredients here. We made the dough before bed and let it rest. Early this am into the oven... hot buttered bread!  Love the wheat texture and as described, it has a light crisp crust with a hint of saltiness and a soft uniform interior that's slightly sweet. It's not  airy and light like Wonder Bread, nor is it heavy like the old stone ground breads my grams used to make in the old country. This honey wheat wont make you chew but it still stands up to spreads. I'd say similar in weight to Pepperidge Farm whole grain that I'm used to.  Great recipe!

Update: Having now made this bread 5 times, we've tweaked the recipe to our liking. Adding 50% more yeast and letting it rise 15 mins longer results in a lighter more conventional texture and a slightly yeastier flavor that we enjoy. I now add 1 or 2 cups of chopped walnuts for a wonderful nutty texture. We've also done walnuts and raisins that we roll in when kneading. Fantastic toasted with butter in the morning. Seems this honey wheat recipe is the perfect jumping off point for experimenting. Bravo!

This is the best wheat bread I have made yet.  I used my kitchen aid with dough hook for about 5 minutes as someone else had suggested.  My kitchen aid was struggling to mix the dough, but it turned out great.  Due to the cold weather, I had to let it rise for over an hour each time in my warm oven.  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing.

OH MY... this produced an amazing couple of loaves of bread.  Light, crispy outside with a fluffy inside.  I used melted butter for the shortening.  I doubled the yeast as per a few other reviewers.  I needed to add 1/2 cup more flour.  I used the dough hook on my mixer and kneaded the bread on level 2 for 10 minutes.  I turned the oven to 200 degrees for a few minutes and let the dough rise in the oven with a damp tea towel over top.  It took only about 20 minutes for the first rise and 20 minutes for the 2nd rise.  Really, really good.  Will definitely make this again.

This bread is fantastic!  I'm a white bread guy in general, but this blows away most store bought wheat breads.  So soft and airy, but still has great structure.  We had different plans for it, but couldn't stop eating it with just honey butter.  I used the bread maker on the "dough" setting until the wheat flour was mixed in, then reset it, added the bread flour and let the "dough" setting complete.  Then it's as simple as punching it down,cutting in half and putting in two loaf pans for the final rise.  This will likely become a staple in our home.

Delicious but it sunk during bake. Had to let first rise go much longer and I even added additional yeast in the beginning. More likely something I'm doing than the recipe, still learning the ropes on bread baking.

This was a great bread! I only made half of the recipe, but I think I might need to make the full recipe next time; it's so delicious and soft. I made my own evaporated milk since I couldn't go to the store, and used melted butter instead of melted shortening. I also sprinkled oats and poppy seeds on the crust. Perfect!

Super easy and a really delicious whole grain bread.  The crust has this light sweetness to it, which took me by surprise - but it was a delightful surprise!  It was unexpected and really set the bread off the charts. If you are on the fence, give this one a try - my family is pretty picky when it comes to whole grain breads (they don't really like them) and they ate this one and loved it.

This recipe is perfect!  The bread is so soft and fresh just like store bought bread with out all of the preservatives.  Even a week later after sitting in the cupboard wrapped in saran it was soft and delicious.  I use fresh ground wheat when I make it and it turns out better than any bread recipe I've tried yet.

I made as directed and had no luck with this recipe.  It turned out very heavy and not sweet at all.  I was hoping for a tiny bit of honey taste.  Will not make again.

I had the same problem as someone else's review with the bread not rising and still doughy in the middle? Any suggestions for this problem. Right now it is only good to slather butter on and eat, I was hoping for good sandwich bread.

Light, soft texture, with muted flavors - I liked this right out of the oven and loved it toasted the next day. I followed the recipe and only had a difference with the rise times; longer in my cool house.  I made it by hand, no machines and was very happy with the result.  Great recipe, Thank you for posting it!

The bread turned out beautiful but a little bland. I followed the directions precisely and I think it could use more salt and be a biot sweeter.

This was okay. Liked the crust, it was slightly crispy, but I found it to be a bit dry inside, and I didn't even use the full amounts of flour. Probably will not make again.

WOW!!!! I've made a ton of bread using all different recipes and this is by far the best bread I have ever made. I can't wait to costumize it and make it my own by adding different things to the bread. I put onion poweder and garlic powder in the water at the bottome of the oven but other than that, i followed it to the tee and it turned out amazing!!!!

AWESOME bread!! I think that I may roll this out and cut circles and make homemade hamburger buns from this. The consistency is perfect if you bake it for just 25 minutes.

I've made this once before but apparently never reviewed it.  And since I can't remember a blasted thing about recipes without my reviews, I made it again and NOW I'm going to review it!  Anyway, it's a nice whole wheat sandwich loaf.  Good for toast as well.  Bf probably won't like this much but since he's dieting and not eating a lot of sandwiches, it doesn't matter anyway.  Very easy, and it needed about 50 minutes in my oven at 375.  Don't worry, though, almost all bread I make takes that long in my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This is the first time I've made bread from scratch without a bread machine and the results were amazing (thanks to this recipe!). I used butter instead of shortening and the bread flour I used was whole grain. I was surprised I could make such a great loaf of completely whole grain bread! Also, I took the loaves out 5-10 minutes before done and brushed them with butter then put them back in... the crust came out so nice and flaky. Thanks Kristin, I will be using this recipe on a regular basis. :)

Flavor wise I thought this bread was fantastic, but I must have done something wrong because I found the bread to be very dense and not at all airy.  I would like to make this again sometime to make sure I didn't get one of the measurements wrong.  Since it was dense though it made a great dessert bread as a late night snack!

Delicious! I would up the honey, and make sure to butter it with unsalted butter after taking it out of the oven. I would also suggest another half hour on the second rise. I put both my loaves in the oven at 170 degrees (lowest it can go) for the second rise.

I made two loaves yesterday and they're almost gone! I did everything by hand and followed the recipe as instructed. I did use butter instead of shortening, 2% evaporated milk, and I increased the honey a little. This bread is heavenly!

I've made a dozen+ loaves of this bread so far. This recipe is great.   I used gluten and dough enhancer which keeps the bread super soft for days.  I also increased the honey by a tablespoon.

This was such a good recipe!! This is only the 2nd bread recipe that I've made that actually came out good! Its definatley a keeper in my book!! The only thing is I didn't have evaporated milk or wheat flour so I used 1% milk & regular white bread flour. It came out sooo yummy! I can't wait to make it with whole wheat flour though, next time I think I'm going to double the honey too as other reviews said, cause I couldn't taste the sweetness a real lot. But definatley a keeper!!

It has been a long time since I made bread. I decided to make some bread yesterday and used this recipe. It was very simple recipe. The baking time was 25 to 35 minutes. At 25 minutes I thought the tops of the bread were getting too dark so, I took out the loaves. I forgot how I use to tent the bread so it wouldnt get too dark. I would have left it in for 35 minutes which I will do next time. And of course make a tent with the aluminum foil when the bread gets to it golden brown color. This bread tastes great and I made my husband a sandwich with it this morning.

I also tried a suggestion of another to add vital wheat gluten and I didnt like it. Didnt rise as high. I also followed another suggestion to add another cup of whole wheat and reduce the white flour by 2 cups and I really didnt like that either. This recipe is PERFECT the way it is. I always use butter for the shortening. Perfection!

I messed up and didn't follow instructions correctly so my middle was a bit underdone and I had some air pockets. Even so, it was delicious! I have been trying many wheat bread recipes and this so far is my favorite. It is so good you almost don't need anything on it. It is delicious all by itself.

I love this bread, excellent flavor and very rich. However I have a problem baking it...I have made this bread twice in the last 4 days trying to perfect the baking.  The first time when I sliced the bread there was a DOUGHY CENTER, which created a giant tunnel in the loaf of bread.  Assuming I had not baked it long enough the second time I baked the loaves for 50 minutes instead of 35.  The loaves still have a doughy center, although it is less so. Is it my kneading, or my glass pans?  I really wish I could figure this out because it is my favorite recipe for flavor.  I have made other bread recipes many times and never encountered this problem!

I used fat-free evaporated milk to reduce the richness.  It worked quite well.  This bread is absolutely delicious, makes wonderful toast and freezes well.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for submitting it.

Incredible! This was my first attempt at bread making from scratch. And it turned out beautifully and everyone loved it. I have made it 2 times and am getting ready to make it a 3rd time in a week. I may never buy bread again this makes great sandwiches and my 2 yr old want toast made only with this bread. She actually eats the bread and not just the butter... Thanks so much for sharing.

love this recipe.. really easy and used milk instead of evaporated milk and it worked great! the only thing that it does not say is to separate the yeast and water and sugar. Make sure you put those together until foamy and then add  to the rest of the ingredients together..

It came out very good.  I also used the Kitchen Aide.  I'm looking for something a little sweeter though.  I think if I double the honey like some said and then adjust the other ingredients I would enjoy it more.  Mom mom LOVES it though :o)

I made this as the recipe states and it came out awesome.  My In-laws now always expect me to bring some over every time I show up, which is usually every weekend.  Thank you

Yes, yes, yes!  Delicious and soft, with perfect flavor.  I double the yeast only because other reviewers suggested it, and if I want it sweeter, I double the honey.  It's just great.  VERY soft and tender.

By far the best 'everyday' bread recipe I have found!  Great for sandwiches, or just eating plain with homemade jelly.

This is a great recipe.  It turns out perfect every time.  I make it ALL the time instead of buying store bread.  I have made some changes: add 1/2 a cup of honey instead of a 1/4 of a cup.  Use 2 tablespoons of yeast instead of 1.  The extra honey requires more flour in the end.  Also, it takes a lot longer for the bread to rise than it says in the recipe...but I still make it because it is so good!

Fantastic! I even forgot the sugar and still fantastic.  Increase honey x 2, increase yeast x 2 and use as much butter/margarine as you need to paint the loaves.  Do make sure and knead the dough for as long as it says. I used all purpose flour b/c I didn't have any bread flour and my honey was all grainy and still good.  PLEASE don't use bread pans, when you form the loaves, just put them on a cookie sheet or two pans that will fit in the oven.  They come out beautiful round loaves.  Bravo!

Wow. I'd give this more stars if I could! I'm going to start doubling the loaves because we went through this bread so fast. Absolutely delicious. I made no changes to the original recipe and it was perfect.

Great recipe! I made some slight changes. More honey, overall as well as honey instead of sugar in the yeast proofing. As recommended by someone else, I used powdered milk reconstituted instead of evaporated milk. Also only used a pinch of salt since I'm not a huge fan of it. I found that I had to add more flour than the recipe called for and the time for rising was a bit longer than stated. I wanted to let it rise in the pans before baking for about 30 minutes longer but ran out of time since I had a dinner date. Still, it's a great recipe and a fun bread to make. Will DEFINITELY be using this one again!

I made adjustments to the recipe as advised by the reviews: extra honey, added molasses, etc.  It was just ho-hum.  Also, I made it in my bread machine and baked it in the machine as well.  Perhaps I'll give it one more shot sticking to the exact recipe and baking it in the oven.  I can't fathom how it beat out all other cake/bread entries in a 4-H fair.

What a gread recipe!!! I used my goat's milk instead of evaporated, only because I have so much. I make 2 batches today and even my husband kept eating it until it was gone! I will use this from now on and I even sent it to my mom. THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

Yum out!  I had to make a substitution and used 1 1/4 cup whole milk instead of 1 c evap milk and 1/4 cup water.  I'm not sure how much it affected the bread since this is the first time I've made it.  But, made as I did, it tasted so good that I thought I would drop dead with taste bud delight.

I guess I better carve out the extra time each weekend to make these loaves! I don't think we'll be buying quite as much bread at the grocery store. This recipe was fantastic! I baked them in my stoneware loaf pans from pampered chef which are well worth the 19.50 each. They give the bread a crispier crust. 8/25/10 Still love this recipe but have to leave the bread in the full 35 minutes and sometimes longer to ensure it is not doughy in the middle. This is a common issue I have with stoneware. However, the crust is totally worth it. 4/12/11 I now double the recipe to make two loaves which extends the baking time to 55 - 60 minutes. I also increase the sugar to 2 Tbl and use 1 cup of regular milk in place of the evaporated milk. Also, tonight I punched out the dough in a square, sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar and raisins and rolled up. Then I placed it in my bread pan and let rise as usual. It was AWESOME!

Really great recipe!!

I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted to make 1 loaf.  But I still used 1 package yeast and 1 tsp white sugar.  The rest of the ingredients I cut in 1/2.  I also used olive oil instead of shortening (because it's heathier).  Also, I used a total of 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour (because I didn't have bread flour).  The bread came out great and my family LOVED it!

Love this recipe!  I've made it a couple of times.  The first time, I made it with whole milk (I warmed it in the microwave) instead of the evap milk and it turned out great!  The second time, I made it with the evap milk and it tasted just as good.  I used my stand mixer hook instead of kneading it myself for about 8 or 9 minutes.  I'm a novice at making bread, in fact, this is the first time, my bread actually rose well.  This is a keeper for my family!

I made this exactly as posted with bread flour.  Our elevation is about 5200ft. in Colorado and I didn't have to alter the recipe at all. (surprise!) Thought I was clever by cutting the dough in half and making a regular loaf, then cutting the 2nd portion in 1/2 again to make two small loaves in disposable tins. (The size is perfect for a kid's sandwich or toast!) Cooked all three.  Froze two so they don't get stale and they taste just fine thawed out.

This was fantastic bread, very soft and did not need anything on it to enjoy its wonderful taste. Too soft for a sandwich bread the first day. If you feel that the dough is too hard or rough to work with it is normal, after the 45 min rise you will see, it gets softer and then agian gets slightly hard after rolling it. But... when it bakes it is very soft. I doubled the yeast. The water inside the oven is necessary. Enjoy!

This makes two wonderful loaves with a lightly sweet flavor.  The loaves do not raise real high.  I liked it because it makes for a smaller sandwich with the smaller loaves.

I made this bread last night when I had in-laws over. I added an extra package of yeast just as I read another person did. I wonder now if it would have risen if I hadn't? No, definitely add the 2nd package of yeast, not just the one it calls for. I baked for 35 min. The smell was awesome and the tops were beautifully browned. I will definitely make this again. Kneading 10 min by hand is a bit hard after 7 min because your arms are tired, but it's worth it! It tasted healthy and my guests loved it!

Wow.  This is one great bread recipe.  I am a beginner at bread making and this was my first try at wheat and it turned out *perfect*.  We ate both loaves in less than a day.  I will be making this again and again.  The only thing I did differently was to increase the yeast to 3 tsp. 

My food processor started to smoke right at the end of kneading, so I may be trying this one by hand from now on.

I have never been good at making loaf bread and it wasn't any different this time around. But that was baker error, NOT recipe error. I made half of the dough into a loaf and it didn't turn out so well but I made the other half into rolls for sandwiches and they were so good! This is going to be a staple for my family, thank you!

I wasn't sure how this bread would turn out because it didn't have any air bubbles to pound out and didn't seem to rise as much as I thought it would.

Shortly after I put the loaves in to cook they rose to a 'normal' size.  I couldn't wait for the bread to cool to cut off a piece and try it.  It was soooo good!  I'll definitely make this bread again.

As a consumer, I give it 5 stars. My husband actually made it and he would rate it more of a 4 star. We didn't have bread flour on hand so he used all purpose. I thought it was soft and delicious - just the right amount of sweet. I think my husband thought it would be a little sweeter - hence his 4 stars instead of 5.

good bread. not great.  This is the type of bread that my husband would call "pillow bread". I prefer a denser, heavier loaf of bread-not the fluffy type. Also, I expected a little more flavor.

very good....not heavy  like most homemade breads.  My loaf took a few hours to rise but that was probably because of the weather.

Nice Nice Nice! I've tried my hand at baking so many breads, but this turned out the best. I especially loved the butter brush at the end. It gave my loaves a slight salty crisp. I stuck to the recipe, otherwise using low fat evaporated milk, wholemeal flour, olive oil and instant yeast. So did skipped the proofing step altogether. Dough was a little sticky and had to work extra bread flour when kneading..that's the messy part. But other than that, I'm really happy with the turn out. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe. I usually use a little extra yeast and replace the shortening with oil. You have to double this recipe because everyone loves it and it goes fast. This bread is great plain, toasted, anyway you like! YUMMY!!

I don't have much confidence when it comes to home-made bread -- I don't have a breadmaker -- but these loaves turned out better than anything I've tried before. This bread has a wonderful, soft texture and a smooth flavor. And it made my home smell absolutely divine as it was baking. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I'll make it again and again. No more store-bought bread for us!

After reading over several recipes, I decided to use this one as a base to come up with my own.  However, the Amish White Bread recipe on this site is the best one so far to follow exactly as written. I made changes in this one; I used all natural White/Whole Wheat flour, used 1 cup of regular milk instead of the canned, 1/3 cup oil.  I had to let one of the loaves rise alot longer(the first one I did as reciped called for and wasnt happy with the results). However, the flavor and texture was great!!

TERRIFIC! Made four loaves and it didn't last long... the texture is light and tasteful and it is relatively simple to make without a bread machine. I substituted the shortening with canola oil, and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again!

I am making this for the second time and it is very good.  A really easy recipe to make.  I make it in my kitchen aid mixer as it is too much for the food processor.  I knead it in mixer for 10 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Proofed the yeast, but this just didn't rise for me.  It's a pretty dense dough.  Maybe it just needed more time.  Very rich and sweet, so it's great if that's what you're looking for.  As for me, I'll go back to J. Drury's Fabulous Homemade Bread.

Love this bread!  I've made it at least three times, and it's taken me that long to get it to rise right, but I'm pretty sure that was operator error- it's the first bread I've ever made.  Easy to make, even without a bread machine and has a really nice consistency along with a GREAT flavor.
Thanks!!

Wonderful recipe, came out perfectly the first time.  The final product was light and sweet and had a great texture!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The only thing I may do differently this time is NOT attempt to mix it in my food processor.  It overfilled the work bowl a bit when I put the ingredients in there.

I made this bread yesterday, following the recipe exactly.  It turned out wonderful.  I did use my stand mixer to knead the bread, mixing for 8 minutes.  I will be making this again soon.

I've made this recipe several times adding 1 T lecithin as part of the melted shortening as well as 1 1/2 T dough enhancer and 3 T. vital wheat gluten along with the white flour.  This is a moist and tender as well as a flavorful bread.

Hands down the BEST bread recipe I have ever made. I can't get bread flour locally, so I used all purpose flour instead. We ate a whole loaf 5 minutes after I took it out of the oven.  The next day, I made sandwiches with the other loaf. PERFECT!

This was my first time making bread. I did it by hand because I don't have a mixer. It tastes pretty good. I will add more honey next time to get a sweter flavor. Also, it took about an hour and a half to rise the first time, longer than the recipe says. I thought it was pretty easy to make for a first-timer.

The first time I tried this recipe I was in a hurry and got the water a little too hot and "killed" the yeast to some extent... the next time I slowed down to "normal baking speed" and it turned out great!

The texture for a wheat bread is nice and light. I like the depth that the flavor has. I think that the slight sweetness that the honey adds is PERFECT. The honey flavor is not dominant, it is just a subtle hint of flavor... JUST PERFECT!

so ono (good)! i did play with it a little cuz well i was running outta flour (both white and whole wheat)...so i made some oat flour by grinding it in a mini food processor...added some flax...used 1% milk for all the liquids...and used non-hydrogenated margarine (smart balance) instead of shortening (not good for u ;P)...i also used whole wheat pastry flour (more of it than the white) but used all purpose for the bread flour...ummm...i think that's all...it is a great recipe...i made 12 rolls and a loaf and the rolls are gone...i only have 3 other people in my family :) this was only the second time i've made bread from scratch...i kneaded it and all...and i'm happy it turned out...it's a good bread for beginners 0_o

Very good! I made this for a family gathering (6 loaves) and there wasn't a speck left! The only thing I changed was I used melted *butter* instead of shortening. Very good and smells heavenly! My little boy (6) said it was the best homemade bread he's had in his *whole* life!

This bread was fantastic!  I have only made homemade bread two other times and this was wonderful.  As I was mixing, I went to melt the shortening and about 3 hrs later went to heat something in the microwave and sure enough, I had forgotten to add it in....by then it was too late, but just so you know, it still tastes amazing, even if you forget the shortening!

I got this recipe out of the all recipe's cookbook, so I did not get to read the reviews.  I have made this bread over and over again because my husband and two year old love it so much!  I look forward to trying this with the variations.  This bread also freezes well...but will be eaten too fast to stay frozen long!

I use butter instead of shortening and add a little more honey for a sweeter taste. I only use 1/2 cup of water. This works great in the bread machine and all I do is form the dough into rolls and let them rise before baking. Easy bread to make.

I made a half a batch in my bread machine, using the dough cycle.  The texture of this bread is so soft & light!  Not only do I plan on making it again, but experimenting with different flours as well.  Wonderful recipe.

I did not like this recipe.  It was not worth the extra fuss of evap. milk and melted shortening.  Can't say exactly what it was, but it had a strong flavor that I didn't like.  Maybe it was the milk.  I prefer my other whole wheat recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe. I substitued evaporated milk with buttermilk, and added 21/2 cups wheat flour and 21/2 cup bread flour. I also placed all of this in the bread maker to knead and rise. After rising I formed dough into rolls and placed in pan to rise. I baked for about 20, but watched them carefully.  Thanks for a great recipe!! I have not a one left!

What a GREAT recipe.  The bread was very moist. Just the way we like it.  I followed the directions completely with the ingredients. The only thing I did differently was use my stand mixer with the dough hook to mix and knead the bread since I do not have a food processor.

Awesome bread!! I forgot to put the pan of water in the oven when I baked it but it was still delicious. I used all-purpose flour for the bread flour and sub'ed one cup of the white flour with a cup of wheat flour. I'm out of honey amd evaporated milk or I'd make more!

Great bread. My kids love it they are eating some as i write this. I was looking for a bread recipes that i could use for everyday bread and i think .....no...i know i found it. We only eat wheat bread around here and with my growing kids and my husband we go through a loaf of store bought bread in no time some times one day. So Just the other day i decided to look for a recipe that i could make my self and just decieded to make my own. And this is it, this is better than store brought bread. This is true keeper. Once dh get home and gets a hold of some i'm quite sure i'll be making more tommorrow. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is really good bread. I appreciate the author submitting it for the rest of us to try. Here's something kind of funny; the first time I made it, I used regular yeast because I did not have Rapidrise. Today I made it again but this time using the RapidRise yeast that I bought specifically for this recipe. Using the RapidRise, it took about 3 times as long to rise as when I used regular yeast.?! Go figure. 
Anyway, both times, the result was 2 delicious loves of bread.
Oh, and yes, both times temp in home about the same, temp of ingredients the same and yeast was fresh and active. Think I'll just stick with my regular (non-rapid) yeast from now on.

Followed the recipe exactly and the bread is delicious.  I will make this my go to recipe.  The only change was that I gave the first rise an extra 30 minutes.

The first time I made this, it hardly rose at all and the bread, while tasting good, was very dense. After a little googling, I decided to try adding some vital wheat gluten from Bobs Red Mill (1/3 c. For a two loaf recipe) to the recipe. That addition really helped the bread rise and the end result was a tender bread. I think that if I had used wheat bread flour that the vital wheat gluten may not have been necessary, but I can’t find wheat bread flour in the stores. I will make this again using the vital wheat gluten.

Spectacular bread!!  I made it and it turned out perfect.  It's sort of allot to do as far as bread goes but I love it and this will be my home's "daily driver" for bread.  Unless I'm feeling vanilla.  Then I'll go white.

This is the best wheat bread I've ever tasted!  I just followed the recipe very carefully. After adding the yeast and waiting the 15 min, I pulsed in processor a few times and turned it out into a large bowl to add bread flour since I wasn't sure if my food processor would be too full to work properly.  Definitely a keeper!

I made it and didn’t have evaporated milk or whole wheat flour so I use 12oz. of 2% milk and 2 cups of spelt flour. It did need a little more flour to form a ball, maybe 1/4 cup. It made the softest bread ever! Perfect for sandwiches. Everyone loved it so I’ll make it again for sure!

Made this 3 times and it didn’t turn out once. I’m not a novice baker and know my way around a kitchen, so I wanted to give it a shot a couple of times. It kept turning out raw a bit on the inside. Glad it worked for those it did.

delicious bread. Did not have evaporated milk, so added nonfat lactose-free milk (1 cup) + 1 tablespoon of condensed milk.  All the times and quantities listed were right on the mark. Highly recommend it!
Wonder if it is possible to make it with more whole wheat than regular flour?

I am not a bread maker but since my husband decided to start grinding wheat from our last harvest and the beekeeper that has hives on our farm always gives us honey, I decided to try my hand at a honey wheat bread.  This bread is easy to make and very tasty.  I've made it three times in the last month exactly as the recipe states and every loaf has been perfect.  My husband was raised on homemade bread and he loves this recipe.

Made this recipe and it was a hit with my family! I made dinner rolls instead of the loaves. I had enough rolls left that I froze the second batch, pulled them out a week later, let them thaw, then cooked them for dinner! They tasted as fresh as the same day batch! And they are a healthy choice that tastes good!

I made it just as recipe directed. Wouldn't change a thing.
Its soft, very light in texture on the pallet, and good flavor.
Couldn't wait til it cooled off.  Warm fresh slice of baked bread, mmm, don't get any better.

This is the best bread I have ever eaten!  I did mine with a stand mixer instead of a food processer.  I only had active dry yeast so I doubled it and made sure to let it activate with sugar and water before I added the next ingredients.  I added 2 extra tablespoons of honey and waited until the mixture was good and bubbly before I added the bread flour.  Young and old, everyone in the family loved it!

Was an easy recipe to follow and tasted amazing. I had a hard time making the loaves smooth but the probably more of a me problem than recipe problem.

"This bread is SO good, Mom," said my kids. It's a winner, for sure. I used whole milk as that's what I had on hand. I used twice the yeast and still it took twice as long to rise. I popped the loaf pans in a warm oven and that seemed to help it rise. I think the water in the oven helped keep the bread moist. I'll make this again.

This dough was very sticky and the way the ingredients were added made the initial mix like wet cement.  I used a 9-cup cuisinart food processor (I looked specifically for food processor recipes) and once it started mixing, I realized my motor was smoking.  At first I thought it was because liquid spilled in, but then realized it was just too much for my motor. SO BEWARE!  Food processors and mixers (which I don't have) are NOT interchangeable.  I routinely make pizza dough for 2 pizzas in my food processor with no problem, but this is just too heavy of a mix.  This dough was incredibly sticky once I managed to get it out of the bowl, I had to mix in AT LEAST another cup of flour.  The dough didn't rise all that much second time - left it for about 40 minutes over a bowl of warm water, covered by a second pan, inverted.  Baked it anyway, it tasted good to me even though a little "flat" (I never bake my own bread!) but not worth ruining my food processor over.  so a warning to others!

It destroyed the motor in my food processor and I thought that the dough was messed up as a result.  Nope.  This is the absolute best whole wheat recipe I've ever had.  I "tried" a piece and ended up eating half a loaf before I had to force myself to stop.

Loved this bread! Very moist and flavorful. I did increase the fast rising yeast to 1 Tbl. which may have helped the rising time. Will definitely make many times going forward!

Really nice texture, and delicate flavor - not too sweet.  I got poor rise as I think my water was a bit too hot.  Will definitely try again to see if I get a better result.  My kids loved it toasted with honey,  and with butter and homemade jam.

Great recipe!  I use a Pullman pan and this fit perfectly.  I made two changes...1) I increased honey to 1/2 cup per others' suggestions and 2) I increased butter to 1/2 cup --not melting it but hitting a cold stick to soften and then adding to dough  after all other ingredients are added, adding in small quantities and kneading it in well with my mixer...then kneaded the whole thing about 7 minutes.  First rise in my 100 degree bread raising setting two about 2 hours.  After first rise I halved the dough and let rest 20 minutes, then shaped into two "snakes" and twisted them together and put in my pan. (Craftsy bread class tricks).  Turned out great!  Will post pic as well!

As it says, delicate and soft. I followed the recipe and it was good. In following loaves I adjusted the recipe to 15 servings and make a single loaf at a time. every 5-6 days. 150+ loaves and still love it.  Oatmeal and sunflower chips are sometimes added. I'll make this many more times.

Made it with all ingrediants to the letter but the dough was a little moist. Added 1/2 cup flour or so until it felt right. Baked two loafes .Eleven wemen thought it was some of the best bread they ever had.

Love, love, love! Just FYI if you only have Active Dry yeast you can use that instead. Just make sure you let the yeast/sugar/warm water mixture sit for 10 min. until doubled in size and extend BOTH rise times to one hour each. The secret to light fluffy bread is making sure both rises have been given enough time. You will get dense bread (as with all breads) if you rush it. We make this every week!

Delicious, very good crumb. Ours took much longer on the first rise than I had anticipated (almost two hours). Second rise was much quicker. Didn't use a food processor; did all by hand - perhaps that was part of the slower initial rise. Good bread - will use again when we have Evaporated Milk to use up. Thanks!

Really tastes good and nice texture.  Mine took a while to raise (like some other reviews), but it's cool in our area of the country right now and cooler in our kitchen.  So,  I just waited longer for it to raise. Next time I will try 3 cups whole wheat flour in an effort to get to all whole wheat flour.   Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe, does take awhile to raise but so worth it. I made this in my KitchenAid mixer, kneading 5 minutes, then another 5 minutes by hand because I like to feel the bread finish. Excellent!

I make one big loaf, since my medium pans are too short for sandwich size bread.  It makes an almost perfect store-bought size loaf.  The texture is perfect.  My weakness is waiting until it cools to cut it.

I am a seasoned bread maker and I even mill my own flour at home. This was a total failure for me both times I made it. I am confounded by the stellar reviews. Never. Again. Will stick with my tried and true wheat bread recipe.

It is really easy and taste great ! After reviewing others, I did two changes. One is to increase to 3 teaspoon yeast and 1/2 cup honey, other than that I stick with receipt. It turn out is really nice . I enjoy it .

I followed this recipe as written.  Best wheat bread I have made so far. It is soft and has a great texture.  The dough was slow to rise, which may be because the house was a little cold.  In the future, I will heat the milk to 110 degrees as well - I think  that will help.  I mixed and kneaded this by hand and it was great.

A couple things I would like to say towards the negative posts: For one, if it isn't rising you need to (1)See if you are using QUICK or RAPID Rise Yeast as the recipe requested or just Active Dry. I use Active Dry...Give it some time. Patience is a virtue.  (2) If it is "bland" to you, maybe try buying a loaf of honey wheat bread.  My husband and I used to buy loafed honey wheat bread. It doesn't taste JUST LIKE HONEY but it has a sweet taste.  This is much better tasting than store-bought.  I add water and let mine rise extra long for those who say it is dense. I found it dense the first time I made it as well.  A lot of things factor in here like what kind of flour you are using, how much water, bottled or highly chlorinated water, etc.  Play with the recipe.  That is what makes a wonderful cook :).  Thank you, Kristin! I enjoyed this.

I made this recipe on a whim because I was out of bread. I used 3C wheat and 2 1/2 C AP flour. It turned out great. After reading other reviews I proofed in a 175 degree oven for 1 hour. The second proof only took 30 min using the same method. I used butter instead of shortening and added 1/8 C more honey. I can't wait for my kids to try it in the morning. I will try it with bread flour next time to see the difference.

I was scared this wasn't going to turn out because it was my first time making bread in years and I live at almost 8000 ft so I had to adjust flour/liquids/temp but it turned out great!!! Its a thicker bread, soft and moist! I love this and will make again! Thank you for sharing.

Made 1/2 recipe and came out great. 
NOTE: 
1. Used regular milk since I had no evaporated on hand (you can make your own evaporated milk if you have time, I didn't.) 
2. Didn't add the extra water since the batter was wetter on account of the milk. 
3. Added a bit more flour to shape it up. 
4. Baked as a round, didn't use a loaf pan
No machine was used. You can make bread without one!

I like to made freezer dough.  I added twice the yeast.  I did the bread by hand and before the first rising I shaped the dough into two flattened balls, wrapped it in plastic wax and into the freezer it went.  To make, allow to sit at room temperature for four hours, shape into loaf and let rise as you would any dough for 1 1/2 hours or until double in size.  Bake according to instructions.  It turned out great! KK

******for people with convection ovens***** If you cook at the recommended 375 degrees it may get too brown on top and still doughy on bottom.....Best to cook at 350 for a longer cooking time!!! Would've given it 5 stars though if not for the high heat it recommends, very tasty!

It was moist and soft.  It has a great taste and is got rave reviews especially fresh out of the oven.  I did have to add more flour than called for to get the proper consistency.  I used a kitchen aid mixer with dough hook, and it did not clean the sides of the bowl and form a ball until I added another half cup of flour.  Other than that it was easy to follow if you are familiar with baking with yeast.  I really liked the suggestion of putting a pan of water in the oven to keep it soft.

This turned out really well. I substituted butter for the shortening, added some salted pumpkin seeds, and opted for an egg wash on top before baking but buttered the top after it came out of the oven as well. Its the best whole wheat recipe that I've tried so far. Absolutely delicious, its fluffy and moist.

Lovely tasting bread, light and delicious.  I made the dough in the bread machine and the rising and baking, traditionally.  I am happy it turned out well since baking anything correctly, eludes me.  (I did use the "better for breads" flour.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I used butter flavored shortening. I didn't quite have a full can of evaporated milk but was still OK. I would like a pinch more sweet and something to add on top for texture. I used a Kitchenaid mixer with the hook.

This is the one recipe for bread that I constantly make. Two loaves are too much so I put one in freezer. Still cuts well and tastes great. 

I make two loaves almost every week. Its the only bread we use now for our sandwiches and well just with butter on top.

AMAZING!  I've just started this week making my own bread - this is my third attempt, and it is the best one yet!  I am eating it right now toasted with some apple butter smeared on it, and it is super yummy.  I made my kids grilled cheese - they are gobbling it right up.  I halved the recipe and put it in the bread machine - worked perfectly (only ingredient I didn't use was the butter just before baking - wasn't sure if/how to do that in the machine).  Definite keeper for our family!!  Thanks so much for sharing :)

Turned out great. It did take awhile to rise so I did what someone else suggested and put it in a heated oven. Made honey butter to go with it and my daughter is loving it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my first attempt at making bread, so it may be a silly question but the instructions never say to take out the pan of water... do you leave it in the whole time the bread bakes?

I made this in my bread machine, super easy and very delicious. My family loves this bread it makes 2 large loaves and they disappear very quickly. I think putting the pan of water in the bottom of the oven helps add moisture to the bread as it bakes.

This bread is delicious.  THe crust is perfect.  I didn't change a thing.  I did use my breadmaker on the dough cylce then baked the two loaves in the oven.  The loaves come out perfectly and the bread seems to last longer than most other bread I've baked.

I've been trying many types of wholewheat breads looking for a good one. So far this one impresses me the most. I stuck to the recipe and will definitely make it again.

One of the BEST breads I've made! Delicious flavor and texture. I did substitute butter for the shortening. This will definitely be my go to on those cold winter soup nights. Thanks for the recipe!

After searching and trying to find the perfect honey wheat bread recipe, this is it!  I am in LOVE with this recipe!  I doubled the honey to 1/2 C. and added 2 T. flaxseed.  I also added about 1/2 C. more flour seeing as it seemed kind of sticky after kneading (which I did in my Kitchen Aid for about 10 minutes.)  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Easy to make!! I only have a hand mixer which proved to be a bit of a challenge, but I managed. The flavor and texture are great.

What a great recipe!  This was the first time I made bread and I can't believe how much better it tastes than store bought.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased at how well it turned out.  I will be making this one again and again.  Thanks!!

This was my first attempt at yeast bread, so to be fair, I don't have anything to compare this with except for a distant memory of my babysitter's home baked bread (40 years ago!). I rated it 5 stars because it was easy and tastes good. Rising time was about double stated in recipe. I will make this again and use some of the variations suggested by other reviewers.

The bread is so moist and sweet.  It doesn’t last long in my house!  I have given loaves of it as "get well" gifts.  My friends have hoarded it and requested it later.

Delicious bread!  I didn't have evaporated milk so I just used regular milk and it turned out pretty good.  Froze the 3 loaves and use them for a toasted breakfast.  Taste doesn't change much at all this way and I don't waste any!

I really really really enjoyed this recipe, I believe the water in the oven made the bread a little softer than I like. But I will be making this recipe again :-)

This bread is amazing - the dough starts off a bit sticky before kneading but gets softer when more flour is incorporated. painted the top with a whisked whole egg with a splash of water.

This is my first loaf of bread, but I already feel like a pro.  This bread is simply incredible.  I used some cinammon butter to coat the bread and bread-pan prior to cooking.  Thanks for another perfect recipe!

I made this is the bread machine (adjusted the recipe to 12 servings to make a 1.5 lb loaf and omitted the extra water) and it looked good.  I prefer my bread a little sweeter though and this was sort of bland.

This was my first attempt at making homemade bread, and I'm hooked.  It came out beautifully.  The only thing I would have changed, is adding more honey.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is amazing bread!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put extra honey in it.  It's amazing that any of it stays around long enough to get eaten with meals or as sandwiches, considering how great it is right out of the oven!  This has become a real family favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

An Excellant wheat bread!!! I doubled the honey but still didn't get much honey flavor in the finished loaf. I made a sandwich for my daughter and she said "I thought you wern't buying bread from the store anymore?" This will be my families wheat bread from now on!!!

Okay, I've made this recipe a couple times and I love it. The bread is easy to make and delicious.  However I have a QUESTION for any of you that are experienced at breadmaking. I'm using 9x5 loaf pans and my bread comes out kinda squat (it's about level with the pan).  I wish it would rise more as my main use for it is to make sandwiches.  I follow the recipe exactly except I let the dough rise for twice as long as it says to (only until it doubles in size), and I knead it for exactly 10 minutes.  Should I maybe double the yeast?  Any tips/advice would be really appreciated! Thanks!

This bread was wonderful. I followed the directions exactly and it was so flavorful, light and delicious. I made a loaf with half of it and then did a braid with the other half. It was so tender and yummy!!! Thanks for this recipe, I will make it again and again.

I struggle with making bread, but you're recipe was simple.  I broke the dough into rolls snuggled together in a deep cast iron pan like my mom used to do.  My husband and I gobbled them up.  They didn't rise as nicely as I think they could have, but I will work on my water temp next time.  Thanks for your recipe!

This bread turned out very well.  The texture was perfect and the flavor was just right.  My husband, who is a dyed-in-the-wool oatmeal bread man.  Asked today if I would bake more tomorrow.  He takes sandwiches every day in his lunch and says this bread is awesome.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This is one of the best wheat bread recipies I have ever had! The bread is soft and moist. You could eat it with butter and replace a dessert!
Thank you!

Very very moist, very hearty, and just wonderful. If you are having problems with the bread becoming too dense, there is no need for gluten. The best thing you can do is make sure not to tear the bread when you  kneed it, and kneed it properly. Kneeding the bread is very important in order for the bread to not become dense. Make sure you kneed it the second time around, as this is just as important as the first time, especially if you are kneeding by hand.

This is SOOO good!  It's pretty time-consuming, but it is so worth it!  I've never baked homemade bread before, and the recipe was easy to follow and turned out GREAT!  I followed another user's advice and doubled the honey.  I invited the 8 year old little girl across the street to help me make it, and we had a blast!  Thanks so much!

This is the best bread I have ever made.  It is so good, my friends beg me to make them loaves every week.  You will need to use more flour than what the recipe calls for while you are kneading, though.  This is the perfect bread for sandwiches.  My family is hooked on it!

On my second try I was able to get the dough to rise by doubling the yeast and cutting back a little on the salt.  The results were excellent. I think I'll cook it at 350 for 35 min instead of 30 min next time.

Delicious--but almost too rich for every day. I froze half the dough instead of baking it. (I let it rise twice and punched it down before wrapping it in saran wrap and putting it in the fridge. Then I still had to punch it down twice before it was completely cold. That's some feisty yeast!)

Next time I'll use more whole wheat flour, and fat-free evaporated milk instead of regular. Overall, a really great recipe, and really easy to make with my stand mixer!

I really love this recipe. Like many others, I double the yeast, and add a smidge more honey (1/3 c). I also substitute olive oil for shortening. I'm making some right now and this time I'm adding a tsp of dried rosemary, and right before I bake I'm going to sprinkle some sea salt on top. can't wait to try this way!

Let me start out by saying that I am a novice when it comes to bread making and the several recipes I have tried so far have left me resigned to buying bread at the grocery store.  Not any more! This recipe was amazing.  I halved the recipe to make it fit in my bread machine and put the ingredients in the pan in the order suggested by the manufacturer.  I didn't have any shortening, so used melted butter instead.  I used the 2.0 lb., basic loaf, light crust setting on my machine.  Next time, I will try the 1.5 lb. loaf setting.  Other than that, no changes necessary, but I could envision adding milled flax seeds, oats, etc. for experimentation.  I will use this recipe again and again.  I'm only a little embarrassed to admit that I ate nearly 1/3 of the loaf (warm, slathered with butter, drizzled with honey) in one afternoon:) BTW, my kids loved this, too!  Thanks so much!

This is the easiest and best bread recipe ever. I've been making it for about a year now. I send it to my husband in Iraq and he loves it! Occasionally, I'll punch down the dough and then let it rise again another 30-45 minutes if I feel really ambitious! Thanks for submitting!

My daughter made this bread for her 4H baking entry last year paired with a honey cinnamon butter spread and won high praise from the judge and a huge ribbon.  Considering there were over 200 entries and most were fancy cakes, we were thrilled that this simple bread recipe did so well!  Thank you.

I don`t know why but I didn`t feel any hint of honey in this bread. Yes, the bread was good, soft, but without honey flavour. Next time I`ll try to increase amount of honey to 1/2 cup.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!! And it was too easy too. I followed the directions and also followed the advice of all of the reviewers and doubled the yeast and also added more sweet stuff ...molasses 1/4 cup, honey 1/3 cup and also put 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 flax meal. The loaves rose nicely and taste fabulous. I think I will put some oats in there the next time too. Such a flexible recipe ....really gave me more confidence with bread making. It"s good for you too!

I am not a bread maker, but with a ton of stored wheat I needed to learn how.  I tried this recipe, doubling the yeast and honey per others' suggestions, and using mostly whole wheat flour (only 1 cup of white flour) and it turned out delicious!  I thought I'd have to try a million recipes before I found one my family would like, but this one is great!  We will definitely be making this again and again!

I am SO glad I tried this recipe! The only change I made was that I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour (I ran out) but it was still wonderfully moist and browned nicely. Thanks for the keeper :-D

just made it and tasted it. wonderful! the dough was so sticky and moist and the bread is very moist and fragile so i might add more flour or oats next time. i put in 1/2 c. roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds and halved the recipe just to make one loaf for my first try. i wasted 5 cups of flour on my last bread recipe that didn't turn out (i think i put the yeast in too hot of water that time) so i'm a little gun-shy...but now i have my bread baking confidence back. thank you!

This is pretty good wheat bread.  I would like it just a tad sweeter though.  I think next time I'll add just a bit more honey.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Even my dad who normally doesn't care for whole grain bread, loved it! i pressed some oats onto the top of the dough before it baked for a nice "whole grain" touch.

There are no words to describe my husband's reaction to this wondrous bread.  I am a novice breadmaker, but this recipe has managed to make me look like a pro.  P.S.  It also makes the best toast you've ever tasted!

This bread rocks! Very easy to make with a stand mixer. The flavor can't be beat. Light yeasty flavor with a hint of honey. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this - especially for a wheat bread - it wasn't as dry as mine tend to turn out, was planning on taking one loaf to work to share but my husband wasn't willing to share!

Absolutely  awesome! no adjustments needed, but it is better with more yeast, and healthier with more whole wheat flour and less bread flour. I make this recipe now every week.

Made with stand mixer.  In spite of screwing this up, it was great.  Added 1 Tbsp extra of honey.  Did not have evap milk, used regular milk and warmed in microwave.  Forgot and didn't let mixture rest 15 minutes, but still turned out fine.  Baked for only 28 minutes.  Perfect.

This is such a great tasting recipe. It was the best bread I have ever had! I have made this bread many times, but find the temperature to be a little high. Once I turned the temperature down, it was great.

This was my first time making bread... I kept thinking I had done something wrong. It was pretty sticky when I was kneading it and the yeast didn't really rise. It was rather flat, but looking around at the photos and reviews, it seems that it turned out how it was supposed to. It tastes really good, but I would have liked it a little taller so I will double the yeast if I try this recipe again.

the bread is very delicious. the bread came out way too dense though. The amount of flour the recipe calls for is WAY too much. use a lot less if you prefer lighter bread.

It's hard to rate a bread recipe, because a lot depends on how well you, as a cook, can bake bread.  I'm not very good at it, but I am practicing, and  this was a good recipe for a beginner.  I wished I would have cooked mine longer, but that was the only thing wrong with it.  It was a little dense for me, but probably because I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  I will be trying this again to perfect my skills.

I had awful luck with this recipe.  First of all, DO NOT mix this in a food processor - mine started smoking and I had to finish "mixing" by hand.  The bread turned out hard and dense.  Not at all what I expected, and I make wheat bread all the time!  Honestly, I may try this once more -- just to rule out my own error.  Hopefully I'll be able to update this rating to make it a bit higher.
UPDATE: yeah... lessons learned, and now YUM. (went from 3 to 5 stars)

When this came out of the oven yesterday, I was concerned - the bread seemed like it wasn't done inside, while the crust was close to black.  So I shrugged, and figured that it wasn't meant to be.  I went to have a slice today, however, and it's GREAT!  Seems like the bread has settled or something.  Have eaten altogether too much of it. As for the recipe itself, I found that it took about 2hours for the bread one the first rise, and then about 45 minutes for the second.  Overall, very good.  Will definately make again.

This is excellent bread! I made 1/2 into rolls and 1 loaf of bread. The only kink was the rising time... it took 7 hours not 45 minutes so next time I will start the night before...oh well, it gave me a good excuse to eat rolls for dinner!

This was delicious!  I have never had wheat bread turn out so great!  I will definitely keep this as my wheat bread recipe of choice!  It did take me longer than the 2 hours and 30 min. it says.  It almost took 4 hours from start to finish!    Even though it took a long time, most of it was in  waiting for it to rise.  I'm sure that it will get faster as I get the hang of it.  Yummy!

I was very pleased with this bread - it looked exactly like the one in the picture!  My husband accidentally left it to rise for an hour the second time, but that didn't seem to affect it much.  It was almost a bit too soft and delicate when fresh, and much easier to slice a day later.  Whatever you do, be sure to try it toasted - it is out of this world.

I'm a novice break maker and chose this recipe for its simplicity and because of the high ratings others have given it. I've made it twice and both times--at the risk of sounding immodest--my bread has been perfection. This recipe is a real keeper.

I left out the evaporated milk and it turned out great.  The honey aftertaste was delightful.

I used 1/4 cup butter instead of shortening as I found my shortening had not aged well. The texture and and flavor are excellent; this receipe is a keeper. 

Also, if you're going to use a food processor to make this bread, BE SURE its motor is up to the task. Mine got a little hot and slow so I finished the kneeding by hand.

I am a novice at baking bread, and this recipe turned out perfectly the first time I tried it!  Also, I found (by accident) that the loaves still turn out wonderfully, even if you forget to put the pan of water in the oven.  Thank you for the confidence to continue baking bread.

Excellent!  The best homemade wheat bread recipe I've found so far!  I think the secret is the evaporated milk and baking it with the pan of water underneath.  Definitely worth the wait and work!  Delicious!  Thx for sharing!

This makes a great everyday bread.  I have 6 children so I double the recipe when I make it.  Stays fresh on the counter for 2-3 days.
