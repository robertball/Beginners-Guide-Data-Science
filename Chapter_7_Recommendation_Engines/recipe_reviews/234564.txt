They were amazing!!! My husband are 2 1/2 in one sitting lol. I can't stay away from them either!! To solve the pan sticking issue, use parchment muffin or cupcake cups. Problem solved!

Didn't cook very well, won't come out of pan or wrapper.  Family just said ok not great, don't need to make again.

I made these last night with fresh raspberries from my mother in law.  I had to add a splash more milk when mixing together because the batter was too thick. Mine baked for 18 minutes and were a little difficult to get out of the pan but worth it. They turned out very good and yummy.  It was a very easy recipe and I was pleased that it was low on the sugar.  I'll be making more of these since I have a whole pail of raspberries left.
