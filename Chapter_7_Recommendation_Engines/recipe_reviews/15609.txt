These were very good after we made a couple of substitutions!  We left out the cabbage, pea pods, minced onions, and garlic cloves.  Instead we used green onions and garlic salt.  It made it a bit simpler and made the taste of cream cheese and crab stand out more.  We will definitely make these again and again!  Thanks!

these were delicious!  but i think next time i'll make it without the bok choy and pea pods...they overpowered the taste of the crab.

I've made this a few times since I have found the recipe. I use pre-made won ton wrappers - they are pretty easy to find! Omitted the bok choy and snow peas. Add shrimp with the crab and put an extra splash of soy sauce in it as well as some garlic powder while also using the minced garlic. I love garlic! It turns out better every time! You just have to weed out what ingredients don't suit your taste and add the ones you like!

It was a great dish but it's hard putting those triangles together. Prep time was about 30-45 minutes for me.

this recipe is good/my first. i dont recommend using the whipped kind of cream cheese as i did, it makes the filling too sloppy. make sure the filling is FULLY refrigerated if not semi frozen otherwise it will leek easily in the oil or on the plate. also garlic powder/salt rather than fresh and less onion(green is optimal) other than those tweeks its delicious

Thanks for the tips - due to other reviews and not having bok choy or snow peas, I cut up some baby spinach, a little celery, and onion. Didn't want to overwhelm the crab and cream cheese. Used garlic salt too. Loved it.

I loved these. I dont know why people dont like them more. I had bok choy from my CSA box but didnt have the peas. The bok choy adds a very unique and wonderful taste. Only cut up the green leaves and not the white part - in case you have never used this before. You can sneak the bok choy past the kids because it cooks down so much. My family loved them.

I wouldn't use anything but the cream cheese, a bit of soy sauce, the crab, and the bok choy. Boil the bok choy first until its nice and soft. For me, having crunchy bok choy in the filling is really awkward for crab rangoon.

These are just like you buy at the Chinese restaurant.  If you don't have the wonton wraps then you can make them really easily with only flour, egg, and water.

I made this without adding all of the vegetables.  Just cream cheese with some garlic, a can of crab meat, soy sauce, green onions, and some sugar.  It was fantastic!  Just like the restaurants.  I make it with the Awesome Sesame Chicken recipe and rice.

This was pretty good to make, it was hard to make.  It won't be somthing I make all the time, maybe once a year.  But for taste I give it a 4 star and for preperation I give it a 3...

I didn't taste the crab meat.  Imitation crab would have sufficed.  They did not need to be fried to be delicious.
