This was incredible. So easy and quick. I made one small change because my panko crumbs kept falling off. I used one egg white to dip the salmon in before I put on the seasoning and bread crumbs. All and all I think any kid or adult that does not like fish will change their mind by eating this recipe.

This recipe was decent.  There is a lot of flavor in it.  I will try it again with a thinner piece of salmon, as the one I used was really thick and over-powered the flavor of the crust.  The crunchiness of the crust was fantastic, and in the thinner pieces of fish the flavor was wonderful.  I think that this might be better as a marinade, mixed in with some virgin olive oil and allowed to soak the fish for about a half hour or so before cooking, then rolled into the bread crumbs.  I'm going to try it this way next time and will revisit this review then.  Perhaps the 3 star rating will come up a bit.

I love the crunchy crust on the outside of the salmon. I used homemade taco seasoning from this site, Taco Seasoning I. Will definitely make this salmon again!

The past 4 months I have been an avid allrecipes user. I love this site! There were so few reviews on this one, I thought I'd add one. This was crunchy & frankly quite yummy. My brother isn't a fan of salmon & he came back three times. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I found myself struggling to keep the crust attached to my fillets. I I just used a packet of Taco Bell seasoning & lightly added a pinch of Lawry seas salt prior to breading.  If you want to try your salmon in a new way, don't pass this one up. It's a keeper!

Super easy and quick to make. It tasted wonderful for such limited ingredients. We added greens, freshly grated cheese, red onions and diced tomatoes in a flour soft taco shell. Family love it and I can totally see us making outdoor gourmet at camp with this simple recipe!

Great recipe! I don't love salmon, but I love it done this way! Very easy and quick meal. Fish isn't usually a good left over meal, however, we had 2 pieces of this salmon left, warmed it in a skillet and had it in a tortilla with lettuce and avocado and spicy mayo, fish taco lunch, Delicious! Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

This was okay.  We did not pick up much of the taco flavor, and the breadcrumbs made it seem more like salmon croquettes.

Great inspiration. I made a few substitutions.  Tilapia filets instead of salmon.  Marinated the fish in taco seasoning with olive oil for about 15 minutes.  Used Jiffy Corn muffin mix with a TBSP of flour instead of bread crumbs to coat the fish before pan frying in hot oil.  Yummy!
