Great quick, basic recipe, which can be easily modified to suit individual tastes.  
We eat this warm, rather than cold.  The first time we added some freshly grated Parmesan.  Last time we added a couple of chopped fresh tomatoes.  
I think a high quality olive oil is really key here (Trader Joe's has a single estate extra virgin olive oil, which is really good an reasonably priced for the quality).  If you like Caesar salad (and anchovies), you'll enjoy this dish!
