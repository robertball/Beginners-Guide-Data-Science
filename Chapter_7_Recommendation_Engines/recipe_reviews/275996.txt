The only change I made was to broil all of the filled peppers for a few minutes, instead of airfrying the second time.  That was due to time constraints., and also that way they were all ready at the same time. Delicious!  A big hit at our party!

Hubs and I both gave this two thumbs up. I don't love cream cheese and he doesn't love cooked  peppers so this is huge for us. 5 stars all the way!
