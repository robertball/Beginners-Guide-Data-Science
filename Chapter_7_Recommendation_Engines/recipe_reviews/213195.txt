This was really good!  Something different from the usual dips I serve.  The friends I had over really enjoyed it.  I used about 1 1/2 c of mayo and then about a 1/2 a cup whipped cream cheese.  Yummy with Ritz crackers!

Made a trial run of this today. I used half lowfat mayo and half FF sour cream. I used thick sliced pepperoni that I found at Grocery Outlet and chopped it and stirred it into the mix so it was evenly dispersed. Solid dip. Very tasty as is. I think I might stir in a little parmesan next time, maybe a little on top. I served this with bagel chips/wheat crackers. My older boy especially dug this. NOTE: I had to omit the jalapeno's because my kids can't handle that much heat.

I made this for a potluck tonight at my childrens' school, and it was a hit! It disappeared quickly, and I had multiple recipe requests. I made as the recipe says, but omitted the red onion and jalapenos (since there were a lot of children there), used lite mayo, and chopped a little pepperoni to put inside the dip. I baked at 375 degrees to shorten the bake time and blotted the grease from the top of the pepperoni. Wonderful recipe! Enjoyed by adults and children alike! Will make again and again, I am sure!

I made a half recipe of this and it turned out VERY greasy.. I had to dump it into a strainer because blotting it with paper towels wasn't helping very much.  Also the consistency wasn't very good.  I think i might make it again but with cream cheese next time instead of mayo.

We enjoyed this.  I made it as written and plan on making again, but will play with the recipe, because I think I can make it into a five star dip with a few changes.  It is very greasy though and blotting it with several paper towels before serving is highly recommended.

Made this for recipe group. My issue with this recipe is not the grease. I make a similar mayo dip and knew mayo, cheese and pepperoni would produce a LOT of grease. I did cut down on it a little by microwaving the pepperoni slices 10 seconds between paper towels. My issue was the taste-- all mayo is just not to my liking. I think half cream cheese or sour cream would help with this dip. It was OK and most of it got eaten. I served with toasted slices of French Bread.

Run, don't walk to the nearest store and buy the ingredients for this recipe.  A M A Z I N G.  We served it on crostini but it would be good on ANYTHING.  Try it. I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Recipe Group Selection:  26, October 2013 ~ This was a delicious dip that was loaded with calories.  I even tried to use low-fat ingredients.  I made this on Halloween as I knew there would be many people here to help eat it up.  We used bagel chips and tortilla chips for dipping.  The one thing about the dip that I didn't like was how much grease rose to the top once baked.  I think if I would have rinsed the pepperoni (WW trick) before adding it to the dish, it would have helped solve that problem.  Nice flavor, easy to make, disappears quickly.  Thanks for sharing, Jennifer.

Made this for recipe group. We had to leave out the onion due to a non-onion lovin' family member but it was still good. Also cut the pepperoni into small pieces. We used regular nacho chips for dippin'.  A nice hard cracker or Melba toast type bread would work nicely too. My boys loved it and gobbled it up! I wouldn't hesitate to bring this to a party. Thanks Jennifer.

Made this for Recipe Group...We loved this! I cut the recipe in 1/2 (used Hellmann's light mayo), but still used the whole 4oz. can of chilies. Also, instead of just using the pepperoni for the top, I chopped it and mixed some into the cheese mixture and put the rest on top before baking. The pic I took is of the dip before it was baked b/c I knew it would be too dark to get a good pic later, lol. This is very rich, but super tasty and addicting...I served it w/ Frito scoops, crackers and pita chips. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very greasy but good. Next time I might make it without the pepperoni.

Taste wise this is a 10, without hesitation. The problem was the puddle of grease that floats on top. I made half a recipe & I used 6 papertowels to soak up the grease & had to set the dish at an angle so we weren't scooping the remaining grease. How would you avoid that, I wonder? We had pita chips with it & it was sooo good.

Giving this a 4 only because the family said to and I used salami instead of pepperoni. I Think its a 10!! I found these great veggie scoop chips at Costco and this dip is Perfect for them! I added a little hot sauce to the top. Terrific flavor! My DD Jennifer, Loved it the Best!! Thank You Jennifer for another yummy dip I can take to work and share with my fellow foodies!

I added 2 cups of Ricotta cheese (made it more kid-friendly in my opinion)  and 1/4 lb deli sliced pepperoni (quartered).  This was amazing!  Everyone loved it! Thanks so much for sharing :) I will most definitely be making it again!!!!!
