Great recipe.  I used pre-cut matchstick carrots for ease and although it did not call for it, I added a small container of ricotta mixed with one egg to give it more of the traditional baked ziti taste. After reviewing the previous reviewers, I added additional seasoning.  I thought it was a good compromise of healthy and tasty and my family loved it!

This was very good and could be turned into a completely vegetarian meal by removing the Italian turkey sausage.

Love this! I read the recipe and then winged it. It's hard to mess this one up. I added salt and pepper and my favorite Italian seasoning blend to the meat, onions, garlic, and carrots and broccoli while they were cooking.  I also added aged Parmesan cheese to the sour cream and spinach mixture.

I liked incorporating all of the vegetables in this, and it can be put together very easily. However, we found this to be too bland for our tastes. I will make again with extra garlic, additional spices and a little salt.

This was good with the addition of some dried herbs. I used veggie sausage.

Awesome ingredients. Ok recipe. Used less than the veggies than the recipe called for. Still turned out great. But had to use two baking pans. I also added Parmesan cheese. I Also took the sausage out of the skin. I also cooked longerThink In future May leave broccoli out and add more spinach. Delicious result though.

This is now my go to pasta casserole recipe. The turkey sausage adds a great flavor and I incorporate as many vegetables as possible, but you can tweak it based on what you have in your refrigerator. I always add either spinach (usually frozen with water squeezed out) or kale, usually a red pepper, and I also like zucchini in this recipe and mushrooms. Don't usually do the broccoli, but if I do I cut it up fairly small, add when I add the carrots I cut them up into matchsticks, also add a can of no salt added tomatoes, which I don't think is in the original recipe. Since I usually don't have sour cream but always have plain low fat yogurt, I usually sub that. Still without those minor switches, this is a delicious crowd pleaser that is often requested by my kids and grandkids.
