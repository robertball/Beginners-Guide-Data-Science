This recipe caught my eye when it was mentioned in a post on the buzz. I made it following the directions using grape tomatoes because they have more flavour at this time of the year. It's easy to prepare,cooks quickly,tastes delicious and looks very appetizing too. It truly is a delight!  Thank you for sharing!

I made a triple-recipe of this for a large dinner party with lots of children in attendance.  I thought perhaps the kids would scoff at it, but no!  There wasn't the slightest scrap left and the bowl was scraped clean.  The original recipe is delicious.  I have since added yellow onion and a handful of whole, unsalted, roasted almonds to the sauté.  Oh yes, and I made it with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. Just amazing!  Love it!

Deliciously easy recipe!  I sprinkled the red pepper flakes on my serving because others don't care for them.  For variation, I will add some onions to the leftovers today!

The only change I made was adding some yellow onion. It was delicious! I haven't enjoyed Brussels sprouts in the past but wanted to give them one more try using s different recipe. The broccoli and tomato worked well with the Brussels sprouts.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Easy to follow and made a delicious side for a Thanksgiving turkey.
The second time I made some changes. I pealed the outer leaves off the Brussel sprouts. Then par boiled them for 1 minute before immediately submerging them in an ice bath. I also added half a cup of diced onion. Both times I've received rave reviews by my guests even those that would normally steer clear of the Brussel sprouts.

delicious! I usually try to avoid brussel sprouts, as I've only had them steamed and unseasoned in the past. but this recipe was so easy and delicious!! I'm definitely a fan of brussel sprouts now and can't wait to find more tasty ways to cook them. my only recommendation would be to add a few more in the recipe, as the veggies shrink down after cooked. thank you!!

This was fantastic, although we didn't use the tomato as we didn't have any on hand. I did add garlic and red pepper flake seasoning, a handful of fresh mushrooms, and half a sliced onion, which really gave it a lot of flavour. My husband loved this and we've had it three times in a week, twice with fish and rice, and with sausage and peppers as a side dish.

We really enjoyed this dish. I did make one  change due to dietary restrictions, I used Earth Balance® instead of butter. My Brussels sprouts were huge so I cute them into quarters as suggested by the submitter. I think that a squeeze of fresh lemon juice would take this over the top. I served this with pan seared salmon and sticky rice.

I usually don't care for Brussels Sprouts, but this recipe has enough other flavors added that it was very nice.  I added half of a yellow onion which also helped.

I loved it because I love broccoli and brussel sprouts cooked any way.  The only thing I would say is if you don't like spicy, cut down on the red pepper flakes or don't add at all.  I don't like spicy foods and this was a tiny bit spicy for me.  Next time I think I will use lemon pepper instead of red pepper, just my preference.

I have made this three times already! First two, exactly as recipe and it was delish! I wanted to keep eating yummy veggies, had some yams and asparagus... I cooked the yams in the butter/garlic for a couple minutes first. Then added veggies, and followed recipe as stated after that. I toasted some pine nuts and put in at the end. It is, yet again, delicious!

Delicious and easy. Made some alterations. Used steamable Brussels sprouts and broccoli for ease and had them in freezer. Doubled the garlic. Used hot Rotel, drained, instead of cutting up tomatoes. Served with Parmesan to sprinkle on top. A bit spicy, as we like it.

Yum! My son, 18 asked for Brussel Sprouts (yep, 18 and wants veggies). He loves broccoli as well, so this seemed like a good choice. We were not disappointed. Thank you.

This is by far the best vegetable melody I have ever had. I followed the instructions except I sauteed 1/2 onion with the garlic,  and instead of salt and red pepper I used a creole seasoning. Absolutely delicious!!

Easy and delicious.  A fine side dish to complement Chef John’s prime rib recipe.

I thought I had Brussels Sprouts but didn't, so I made this with just the broccoli, tomato, garlic, butter and salt, plus a few shakes of 6 pepper blend. Wow! It was delicious! I just did a rough cut of the tomato and left the seeds, too. I'll try it again with the Brussels Sprouts added in for sure! Thanks!

I'm not a big Brussels Sprout fan, but this was still a good dish.

Oh my god this recipe is so good. I've never been a lover of Brussels sprouts but I decided to try it again after 25 years and this recipe is just delicious. If you are a pepper lover don't be afraid to use it.

It is very Good.  I put a little ham in it.  It was just enough for a nice casserole, with a small salad.

A big hit at our Thanksgiving table this year! The combination of two of family's favorite veggies was great.  The tomatoes add a bit of contrasting flavor and made the dish look so pretty on the table.  We skipped the red pepper flakes, too spicy for our young children, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Yum!

Good starting point.  I like a little more punch so I took advice of others. Added some fried shallots, fried pancetta, fried bacon along with a splash of balsamic (doubled the recipe).  Excellent!

It was very easy to make and looked colorful. This would be a good Christmas season side dish since it has all the right colors.

I probably added more garlic and used some cherry tomatoes that needed eating (so I didn't deseed them), but it was really good and I'm glad I found this recipe!  I also didn't add the red peppers because I wasn't sure my guests would appreciate them but I'll try it next time with just family!  Enjoyed it as a side dish with grilled lobster and baked potatoes--delish and simple!

This was great! I made a few changes. I added some bacon and used the grease and olive oil to brown the broccoli and brussel sprouts. I had cherry tomatoes and used those and added some chopped up green onions that I had leftover from making some tuna salad. I also added some balsamic vinaigrette at the end. I don't really care for brussel sprouts but I cook them for my son and grandkids. This was an easy and delicious dish. The recipe was easy to change and I ended up liking the brussel sprouts.

This recipe is a keeper!   I made a double batch as a vegan side dish with Smart Balance in lieu of butter and it was a huge hit.  The garlic and red pepper flakes give the brocolli & brussel sprouts a taste lift.

What an easy recipe! I substituted olive oil for butter. Not only does this blend of veggies taste well together; they also look great together! Love the colors.

This didn't excite me very much but my portions were a little off. I would add more garlic if I made it again.

I love Brussels sprouts, but this combination of Brussels sprouts and broccoli just did not go together. The seasoning was OK, but the combination with the seasonings did not work,.

Maybe I just don't like brussel sprouts, but this did not appeal to me at all. Easy to follow recipe makes this three stars
