While I loved the dressing on this salad, and the strawberries, coconut and red onion, I found the candied almonds took the sweetness factor over the top. I would simply toast them on their own next time, without the sugar.

Excellent salad  I toasted the almonds but left out the sugar and salt.  I used olive oil instead of salad oil.  my husband, who hates salad asked me to make it again.  The second time I added slices of grilled chicken breast and served it as our meal.  I'll be making this again and again

Loved it, except next time I would skip the sugar and salt on the almonds and just lightly toast them in a dry skillet - the sugar and salt didn't adhere at all, anyway.  I wasn't sure about the dressing, as I generally am not a fan of sweet dressings, but the tart lime offset it nicely, and the thing that made it for me was the toasted coconut.  Only ingredient change was grapeseed oil instead of vegetable - otherwise I wouldn't change a thing! Really enjoyed this!

I amazingly followed the steps as written and subbed nothing... the result? YUM!! This will turn anyone into a salad-eating maniac. =) As only the fourth reviewer, I hope this one takes off! It is very deserving of 5 stars. Great blend of flavors - I would strongly suggest making both the sugared almonds and the dressing...itcomes together surprisingly quickly! You won't be disappointed!

Okay first off this salad was amazing but I did do it a tad bit differently...I didnt make the dressing it called for I bought a strawberry chardonay dressing that was amazing, and I used a 50/50 mix which was baby spinich and spring salad and then I did everything else the same...only thing was I forgot the red onion which I bet would just send the salad over the top good with that added. But like I said this salad was amazing and I would recommend it to everyone I Know, I think it will become my new side dish at family get togethers. Thank you.

Wow...this salad was great!  Now to my personal tastes it reminded me more in drink flavors of like a strawberry margarita vs. a strawberry daiquiri (I believe that was due to the lime juice).  But who cares what the name is...this salad was excellent.  And it was just as visually as it tasted!  This by far is the best I have made from this site!  I can't wait to make it again and again!  Thanks for sharing Heidifil

The dressing and strawberries reminded me of a strawberry limeade, very refreshing for summer!  I don't like honey, but it blended nicely in the dressing. I only toasted the almonds, I don't think they needed the extra sugar.  The salad was also good without the coconut and onion.  I added some cotija cheese for a little saltiness, I think feta would be good too.

This salad was a huge hit at the potluck.  I used honey mustard cause I didn't have dijon handy.  It turned out great and was gone in a flash!  I do agree that the dressing needs just a touch more sweetener even though I love the tart fresh lime flavor.  I added scant 1 T of sugar to the dressing and thought it was perfect.  I subbed meyer lemon olive oil for the vegetable oil and brown sugar for the white the next time I made the salad and added a little agave sweetener to the dressing - just as fabulous!!

OMG!  This salad is amazing.  I loved the flavors, the only change I would make next time is using a sweet onion; the red onion's flavor was just a little to bold for me.  Also when I made the dressing I added 1 tablespoon sugar, it was a little sour still for me even with the honey.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Just made this for a Valentine Dinner and my guests comments were "WOW"  best salad we've had in a long time.  "Can we have the recipe?"  My usual answer, can't do that, it's an old family recipe.

LOVED this salad.  Thought the dressing was perfect and loved the combination of ingredients!  I felt the almonds were a tad too sweet and next time I will either eliminate the sugar coating or reduce it by half.  Thank you so much for sharing this great salad recipe!

This is really good!  It would be perfect for a wedding or baby shower.  The only thing I did different was no poppy seeds, still very yummy!

So good! I just eyeballed the ingredients on the dressing since I was just making it for myself.  Yum!  I loved the coconut, but I did forget to toast it and know it would have been so much better!  Great, fun recipe!

Very good salad!  I made it for a crowd and got rave reviews.  The cooked nuts were delicious alone (make extra to munch on).  I added the sugar to the dressing by mistake, but would do it again in the future because it was yummy.

Fantastic!  Made it exactly as written. Loved that it was so easy to throw together.  I found it a bit limey and plan on using a bit less lime juice next time.

I made this salad for my friend's 60th birthday party last night.  The presentation was lovely and got raves.  The taste? Everyone who had some said they liked it. The hostess' husband, LOVED it and finished the bowl at the end of the party!  I did a few things differently though.  I mixed baby spinach with a spring mix like someone else had suggested.  I made the dressing as directed, but it was too oily tasting. I didn't like it at all. So I tossed it and started over.  I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil but only about 1/2 the amount called for.  Then I increased the mustard to 1/2 tsp. instead of 1/4 tsp. and I used spicy brown instead of dijon.  I added a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar to balance the sweetness of the honey and to bring out the tang of the Lime juice and the mustard.  The consistency and flavor were perfect.  As some reviews commented on the sweetness of the sugared almonds, I just used about a half tablespoon (I use Xylitol) to sugar glaze and toast them.  The salty taste on the almonds was nice.  (And to save time I always slice strawberries with my egg-slicer)

tasty! my husband who doesn't normally like fruit in salads enjoyed this. he also does not like anything with vinegar so this dressing was a good alternative to the typical strawberry salad dressing that has vinegar or is a balsalmic vinaigrette. easy to make and quick to assemble.

I made it without coconut and onion. I also used Splenda instead of sugar.   It was the best strawberry spinach I've had.

Delicious variation on spinach and strawberry salad.  It was well liked though a touch sweet, even without sweetening the almonds.

My family and I loved this salad. The only change was I added toasted almonds and did not do the sugar ones. The dressing was wonderful.
