This is one of the best desserts I've ever had. I was raised by a French pastry chef and have high standards, and I couldn't believe how simple yet decadent this dessert is. It was a huge hit at a recent party. Everyone was fighting over the last few pieces. (Note. didn't have rice crispys and made it without it. And it was great.

I did not have rice crispies, so I used corn flakes. Awesome topped with Free Cool whip. Definitely a keeper.

Very good.  I did not use the rice cereal because i din't have any but it was good without it.  I made one with sugar at the same time and this recipe was far superior.

I didn't really like this that much.  The orange flavoring made the apples a little too tangy for me.  The crumbles had a good flavor but overall it wasn't quite crunchy enough or sweet enough.
