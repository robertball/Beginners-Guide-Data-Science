I like this recipe alot because it is different, although I fix it differently than above, and this taco salad is a huge hit at all my family gatherings.  My family expects it.  I use Catalina dressing only, and I add Doritos to instead of plain chips (nacho flavor is the best but you can use any flavor)  I also omit the sour cream and add black olives.  Instead of putting the dressing with the meat, I mix it all except the dressing and the Doritos, then mix while serving so the chips don't get soggy.  Delicious!

Omgoodness, we ate too much of this! First of all, we browned the the beef with onion and used homemade taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I) from this site. We omitted the beans. We did add water to simmer the meat. Then we had chopped green onions, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, bagged, shredded lettuce, salsa and sour cream to build our taco salad. We had fritos instead of tortilla chips. I sat out the Catalina dressing so that everyone could control the amount. We used fat free sour cream, cheese and catalina dressing. We tried to make this as healthy as possible. This was delicious!

I make this same recipe but I don't cook the dressing in the hamburger mixture and I omit the chili beans.  I mix everything up (hamburger cooled) and pour the dressing over the salad fixings and combine - I also use crushed nacho cheese Dorito's instead of tortilla chips.

We have made this recipe for years but the way to make it really tasty is to use Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips. It adds another dimension of flavor.

This was so good, I would suggest adding the meat mixture to the lettuce as it is served to each individual person.  I couldn't save it for another meal because the lettuce wilted and the chips went soft.

Great fill-in dinner when my original plan didn't work out. I made my own taco seasoning and my own French dressing. I did not water down the dressing. My kids and husband ate their taco salad with the tortilla chips but I had mine with just lettuce, tomatoes, a tablespoon of reduced fat sour cream and homemade salsa. This was enjoyed by all.

This recipe went over really well with ALL the family.  The dressing and taco mix gave it the zip it needed!!  In anticipation of a big appetite, I doubled this recipe,  It was so much food! Unless your feeding an army, dont double.  Out of 12 in our family, only 1 did not like this.  Again as some of the other reviews, I didn't add near the amount of water it called for (only about 1/2), and it made it nice and perfect!!

I didnt like the combined flavor of the taco seasoning and the french dressing. I ended up throwing most of it out. Probably wont make again.

My husband made this (amazing all by itself) for a party one summer.  It was fantastic.  He left out the chopped tomatoes (because I don't like them) and used nacho flavor tortilla chips and it was great.  The tangy sweetness of the French dressing was a welcomed surprise.  Just a delicious recipe!

Now this is delicious Denise.  I absolutely love "Taco" anything and this was just great.  I did not mix the dressing into the meat mixture..(I'm thinking it would have made it too sweet), but rather poured a little over each serving and left our the sour cream since I'm not a fan.  I have made this many times and have also used corn chips versus tortilla chips and it's just as yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

A personal favorite at our house!  We do each salad individually - I also add hot sauce and some ranch to mine!

Yumm-o.....one suggestions, let meat/dressing mixture simmer for a while (I did about 30 min), then turn off heat and let cool a bit before adding to the salad....will thicken up as it cools and won't lilt the lettuce

I used Catalina dressing in lieu of French dressing. I used black beans instead of chili beans. I also added a can of corn, drained, to the mixture. Recipe is a keeper as the whole family enjoyed. Thanks.

I'm 18 and have recently started cooking actual meals. I LOVE taco salad and wanted to make it and I came up on this recipe. I actually just finished eating it and it's DELICIOUS! I was a bit iffy about the French dressing, but I could barely even taste it. I followed the recipe to a T, the only addition was a handful of chopped onion and green onion each. I'd definitely recommend.

Great recipe all though, I would cut down the amount of french dressing as it made the ground beef just a tad sweet. Otherwise they were a hit with my family!

Simple and tasty! I used ground turkey in place of the lean ground beef. I omitted the refried beans, per my family's request. For the taco seasoning, I used, "Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning," from this website. I did not have too much fat to drain from the cooked meat and only added a little liquid to the taco seasoning. I made, "French Salad Dressing," from this site for the bottle French dressing. I also did not cook the dressing in the meat as I drizzled it over the salad. Instead of purchasing a package of tortilla chips, I took a slightly different route and fried up some yellow corn tortillas in vegetable oil using, "Hard Taco Shells," from this site. Once I fried up the tortillas, I broke it up and used that in place of the tortilla chips. I thinly sliced the ice berg lettuce and tossed it with the meat, chopped roma tomatoes, chips and shredded cheddar cheese. I put some of that mixture on the plate and added some sliced black olives. I drizzled a little french dressing and pace picante salsa over the salad. I topped that with a dollop of sour cream and garnished it with thin sliced avocados on top. The french dressing gives this a nice twist. It is a slightly sweet flavor and does not compete with the mild flavored salsa. It is a nice departure from the usual taco salads we normally eat. Tasty, hearty and fulfilling salad. Great for a summer dinner!

I enjoyed this taco salad and took others' recommendations to use nacho flavored Doritos.  I left the chips and dressing out of the salad and instead had each person use whatever amount of chips and dressing they wanted.  That way the chips wouldn't get too soggy and the dressing wouldn't made the salad mix too liquidy.

After years of watching my mom make this, I moved out and made it on my own--and forgot to buy any sort of dressing for it. Thus I discovered that you can just mix a jar of taco *sauce* into the meat mixture and it provides enough tasty moisture to be perfect for all your veggies. I'm also fairly certain that taco sauce is better for you than French dressing (or Catalina or Russian or whatever you're using--they all work actually), at least the low-sodium kinds. This recipe is also good with homemade tortilla chips made from bought soft tortillas that you spray with Pam spray & heat in the oven til crispy--something else I discovered due to not remembering to buy everything I need at once :-)

The salad was okay. I only added 3/4 of the bottle of dressing. To me it was too sweet. There are better taco salads out there.

This recipe is delicious. I have made it for years. Instead of French dressing, I use 1/2 taco sauce and 1/2 Catalina dressing (whisked together) and poured over the salad at the end. Let each person pour their own. Some people don't like as much dressing. I even pour a little of the Catalina/Taco sauce mixture into the ground beef mixture.  Fritos or tortilla chips...both are delicious!! You can get totally creative and add what you like (i.e. green chilis, black olives, avacados, etc.)  It is so good!!

So easy!  My mom used to make this when we were kids.  I took the lazy way out:  browned the meat, drained it, then added the taco seasoning + 3/4 cup water, and simmered 10 minutes (per the instructions on the packet).  After that, I added the beans (I used 'Ranch Style' beans), and heated through.  Next, I put chopped lettuce in bowls (bought a bag of romaine to save time), topped with the meat mixture, then chopped tomatoes, then drizzled the French dressing in a big circle, working my way in (ended up looking like a spider web), and added crushed chips on top of that.  Pretty presentation for such a simple meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! Many of the reviews suggest not adding the chips until serving. I disagree. I crush the chips into small pieces and I think the softened chips add a great flavor and help to thicken the hamburger mixture. I do reserve chips to top with when serving to give it that extra crunch. I also prefer catalina dressing, but the french dressing works fine. I do NOT mix the lettuce into the ground beef mixture. I prefer it served on top of crisp, cool, shredded iceburg.

This is similar to my favorite combination of ingredients for taco salad... I would try and reduce the calorie count by using Catalina Free French dressing, cutting the amount of shredded Cheddar and tortilla chips in half and subbing avocado for sour cream!  Still yummy!

Love this recipe!  I add a couple more items to the party though and that is chopped cucumber and thinly sliced radishes for extra crunch.  This is one of my family's faves.

This salad is excellent.  It took a lot longer than the recipe said to cook the meat but was still delicious

I love this salad. I did make a few adjustments. I used Catalina dressing instead of French and I used Dorritos instead of Tortia chips.

Great recipe, I made it as directed but would recommend a few changes for a better result. First the meat mixture was way too watery with a full bottle of dressing plus all the water. I had to cook down the mixture for about 30 minutes to get the water out. That separated the oil from the dressing so I had to keep draining it off. 

Instead add 3/4 cup water to the taco seasoning, mix it well then pour over browned and drained meat. Bring to boil then simmer the water out until just moist. Add the dressing and beans and let cool before adding to salad or you will get wilted lettuce. Mix in the chips last (I use nacho cheese chips), so they don't get soaked. The family said this was the best taco salad ever!

For this as is, it is not for us. I had to change a lot of things around.

Changes:
*Ground Chicken
*no chili beans
* light ranch dressing
*fat free greek yogurt as sour cream sub
*bag of salad with romaine and iceberg 
*added in fresh cilantro

Changes to the makings:
I mixed the meat with the dressing after it was cooked before serving. So if we needed to we could eat  this later with no problems reheating.

Since I had to make so many changes I had to lower the star rating. This did help give me a great idea though for a taco salad.

This was such a great recipe. I used an 8 oz. bottle of lt. French dressing, sauteed a few onions with the meat,and left out the chili beans. I also added some black olives to the lettuce mixture. To keep from getting soggy, I mixed the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese in a separate bowl. Then, I lined individual bowls with Dorito taco-flavored chips, filled the bowls with the lettuce mixture, then added the meat on top when ready to serve. Everyone added their own salsa/sour cream.

I have made this recipe before, ecxept I brown the ground beef and add it to the rest of the ingredients (more of a cold salad). My recipe calls for Italian dressing but I use the Hidden Valley Ranch "Spicy Ranch"

This is really the best taco salad.  I used less water and cooked the meat mixture longer. I highly recommend putting the salad together on indiviual plates (or bowls); otherwise the chips get very soggy plus you are able to add the amount of sour cream and salsa you want. I used corn chips crushed and it was great.

I have not tried this exact recipe, but I have had a similar one.  As a suggestion to those who didn't like the looks of the salad try layering it and adding the dressing last.  It gives a beautiful presentation.  I have also had it with 1000 island dressing.

You can cut calories significantly by doing canned lowfat chicken (or shred yourself) a few black beans, fat free sour cream, salsa, and lots of lemon juice.  It is very good this way and you don't even miss the dressing/chips.  Every now and then I add rice like Chiptole.

I make this type of taco salad but use ground turkey instead of beef, taco flavored Doritos instead of tortilla chips, add black beans and kidney beans and instead of french dressing use Ortega taco sauce!  It's awesome that way!

I haven't made this in awhile but do love it.  My only suggestion is that unless you know it will be consumed in one sitting, only add the chips to each individual serving as they will get soggy.  This is not a dish worthy of leftovers.  I have only used Catalina but might try the French dressing next time.

This was amazing!!! I read other reviews and I was worried about it being too liquidity, so I only used a half bottle of french dressing. I added some olives and used Fritos, and it came out perfect! I didn't know what to think about using french dressing, but I did it anyways. Thank you!! This is going in the recipe book.

OMG Seriously. I never would have thought in a million years that French dressing and tacos should ever be mentioned in conjunction together, much less combined, but this was AMAZING!! My family was raving with every bite. Only made 2 changes to the recipe: simmered for 30 minutes as another reviewer had suggested, and added some sliced avocado ('cuz avocado rocks with tacos). Absolutely delicious, this will definitely be a regular favorite with us!

We loved this recipe.  I read many of the reviews and then made a few changes. I used black beans instead of chili beans.  I also added corn.  I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg – much tastier and more nutritious. I couldn’t find a French or Catalina dressing without corn syrup (we have eliminated fructose/corn syrup from our house), so instead used Braswell’s Vidalia Onion & Summer Tomato dressing.  It was wonderful!  This has turned out to be our very favorite taco salad recipe. 

Also – we kept the meat ingredients separate and each person assembled their salad.  We were able to have leftovers the next day without anything being soggy.  My DH usually doesn’t care for leftovers, but he raved again about this the next day.

I used 3/4 pound HB and 1 1/2 cans beans (this would probably be good with no meat and maybe 2 1/2 cans of beans).  I used Catalina instead of French dressing.  I use Romaine or green leaf lettuce instead of iceberg.  Nacho cheese Doritos are crucial to the recipe.  You'll have to have this salad at least once a week!  It's addictive.  I didn't bother with salsa or sour cream so I don't know how the recipe tastes with them.  I can't imagine they could make it taste any better, though.

Very good!  The only thing I would do next time is maybe not use the whole can of beans... I added 1.5lbs of ground beef instead of 1lb and it worked perfectly with the amount of sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

Everyone loved this recipe except 1 person in our family.  The french dressing gives the meat a sweet flavor that 1 out of our family of 4 didn't care for. All the rest gobbled it up and had seconds.  Personally, I am looking forward to using the leftover meat-mixture wrapped in tortillas for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe to a T but I used fat-free dressing.  It seemed a bit too watery after simmering for 15 minutes.  Next time I will not add so much water to my empty dressing bottle because fat free dressing prob has more water in it to start with.

I made a few changes to this recipe. Because my husband and I don't like French dressing, I substituted a 16 oz. jar of cilantro picante sauce, added a little less water and corn chips instead of tortilla chips. I also simmered it a little longer while I cut up the tomatoes and lettuce because the picante sauce is a little watery compared to the dressing. But in the end, it was sooo delicious!!

This is excellent.  The only thing I would suggest doing differently is leaving the lettuce and tortilla chips out until serving.  They get soggy by the time your ready to eat. Yummy

I combined the beef, beans, and taco seasoning with some chopped onions and a little water and brown that up. I used1/2 catalina and 1/2 thousand island dressing. To keep it from wilting, I had the lettuce on the cutting board, shredded cheddar cheese on the side, chopped up tomatoes in another bowl, and broken up Doritos in another bowl. Then I have a "mix" bowl handy and keep all ingredients separate..my family makes up their own individual taco salad in the mix bowl and transfers it to their plates.  That way, when the meal is over and if there are left-overs I can store everything in separate containers and the chips and lettuce don't get soft.

I thought this was a really good spin on taco salad.  I did not use the whole bottle of french dressing (I only had about 3/4 of a bottle).  But it definitely gave the salad a sweet flavor.  My son, who is the pickiest of eaters at our house, really liked it a lot.  I prefer a regular, more traditional, taco salad.  But this definitely wasn't bad and I may use it for a church potluck coming up soon. We skipped the salsa and used ranch dip instead of the sour cream.

This recipe is great, I have been making it for years. The only thing different is I put the french dressing on the top like a salad. I am living in Australia now and they don't have french dressing and I so miss it.

I agree with some of the other reviewers, when making this use CATALINA Dresing and use Dorito chips, this taste so much better.

As is, this recipe is barely edible. It's a goopy, soggy mess and the French dressing makes it too sweet.

Very good. I used less salad dressing and used Brianna's Poppy Seed dressing instead of French's dressing as they are both sweet and I didn't have the latter. I also used Morningstar Farms Veggie Crumbles instead of ground meat and it was delicious.

This was great!  I kept the meat in a separate container so we could have leftovers and avoid making the salad mixture all mushy.  Delicious!  My friend who I served this to loved it.

I loved this recipe!  I changed it a little as I didn't have the same ingredients on hand.  I used ground turkey, red leaf lettuce, can of Bush's Texas Ranchero Beans (made it spicier) and a 16oz jar of salsa because I didn't have tomatoes.  This recipe is awesome!  Thanks Denise.

It was great - I gave it 5 stars because it is yummy, but with 846 calories I made many modifications. I took the advise of others and used some catalina (not the whole bottle) and didn't mix it in with the meat.  I omitted the sour cream and beans, increased the lettuce, used 1/4 of the chips but I used doritoes like others suggested, and I used turkey for the meat.  And because I didn't read it till just now, I forgot to add salsa.  Oops :)  Anyway great!

I was not a huge fan of the French/Western dressing being cooked into the meat- my fiance wasn't either. I felt like I was eating sloppy joe salads... Otherwise, it was good.

I just made this for dinner tonight- it turned out really good. Like everyone suggested, I didn't mix everything together. I left it all in seperate bowls- buffet style. I have 6 kids & they were able to "personalize" their own. However I used 2 lbs of meat- & I didn't put the whole bottle of the French in their like others suggested either. I only used about 1/4 c. in there for flavor- & then gave everyone some afterwards.

I made this yesterday for a baby shower, and it went very quickly!  As others suggested, I reduced the water to about 1/8 of a bottle.  This resulted in a thick sauce that coated the ingredients well.  To save time I substituted a 16oz. bag of pre-washed iceberg lettuce.  Lastly, I omitted the beans, and left the salsa and sour cream on the side for individuals to choose.

this was good for the first 10 minutes! after that the tortilla chips were soggy and i ended up throwing most of it away. i would suggest keeping the chips separate. probably wont make it again.

This was a great salad. I made it for our Canada day picnic at my church,It was a big hit all the ladies wanted the recipe.I did what others had said and used less water I also cut out the chilli beans and added half a pound more of the ground beef. I also saved some cheddar cheese and put it on top then added extra sour cream on top of that.I made the beef mixture up the night before and cut up the vegies the night before and mixed everything up just before serving.TRY THIS RECIPE YOU'LL LOVE IT!

This was great for a change in dinners.  BUT, the meat was too sweet with the salad dressing.  Next time I'll just use a BIT of salad dressing when cooking the meat.  My family loved it, but I am not into "sweet" meat.

Sorry,but we didn't find this very good.  Kids thought it looked like throw up.  Just way to heavy and you probably need to be a dressing lover to stomach this.  It is very easy and quick to prepare.

Everybody loves a good taco salad. This is good and easy. Kids and husbands can even handle this one! A great easy meal for a hot summer day or a perfect dish to pass for a family reunion or picnic. Serve it with fruit and an icy drink.

We preferred to mix in the French dressing at the end - just before serving and the kids didn't care for the chili beans.  We also cut down on the water in the beef mixture so it wouldn't be so sloppy.

This is a GREAT recipe. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the French dressing, but it turned out great and made for a great salad! The only thing I did differently was use less dressing (not by much.. i used 3/4 of the dressing rather than all) This salad is extremely filling! We both made a HUGE salad and couldn't finish it. I had some of the meat mixture left over and used it as a filling for soft tacos. I put the filling in the tortilla then added shredded cheese & sour cream... amazing leftover lunch :)

This was disgusting. Yes, it was edible and had flavor, but flavor wasn't good. There was a tangy off-putting flavor. Probably would be better if you don't use the salad dressing and make your own sauce from scratch. The video for this got me excited and i admit, I'm new to the site and didn't read any reviews before hand. This is a 2 star recipe plain and simple. I won't make it again. The salad dressing easiness made me question it for a moment but i went off the high rating and not the reviews- which  was a mistake :(  If you like fatty foods then I can see why you might like this, but it wasn't for me.(and not only should you drain the beef you should rinse it in hot water to get as much fat off as possible.)

Very good recipe.  I was surprised by how the french dressing blended with the taco seasoning.  I'm not sure that this should be considered authentic Mexican food but good nonetheless.  The only change I will make if I make it again will be to keep the meat mixture seperate from the chips/salad mixture and only mix one serving at a time.  The chips and lettuce become really soggy when there are leftovers to be warmed up later (something I always have since I am usually cooking only for myself).  Overall very good though.

I've made taco salad before but decided to try this one because it seemed a little different with the addition of french dressing.  I gave it three stars because I did make some changes.  As written I would probably only give it one star.  I only used 1/2 a bottle of French dressing.  If I had use the whole bottle it would have been WAYYYY too much.   The french dressing gives the recipe an odd sweetness.  I used mild salsa because it's what I had on hand.  It would have been MUCH better with medium or hot salsa.  Let's see, I used black beans instead of chili beans, torn spinach and bibb lettuce instead of iceberg. I never use iceberg lettuce on ANYTHING because there are better choices out there with higher nutritional values!  I layered the salad versus tossing it all together (crumbled tortilla chips, torn lettuce, meat/bean mixture, shredded cheese, salsa, chopped tomatoes, sour cream).  I will stick with my original taco recipe as my family likes it better.

I am concerned about the calories and fat grams. It sounds soooo delicious, but 846 calories and 56.5 grams of fat for 1 meal is a little too much.

Strange.  Per other reviews, I used less dressing...somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of the bottle.  The taste of the mixture by itself was pretty bad (sweet) but when you add the chips, cheese, etc., the sweet taste disappeared and it was not bad.  I doubt I would make it again.

I normally never rate anything low, but I'd have to agree with others on the overload of dressing.  After simmering for 15 mins I had an entire pan of grease - I actually had to drain a second time.  We also thought the chili beans were out of place.  I would definitely put the dressing on the side to each persons taste.  I did use taco tortilla bowls which was very fun for this dish.

I only give this a 3 because of a few different things. First I didn't like the French dressing at all.  It made the whole thing taste off to me. Not only that, there is WAY too much dressing in this recipe. I'll go back to my trusty Catalina. I never cooked the dressing with the meat as we have always eaten this salad completely cold. I cook the meat, let it cool and then add dressing, onions, red peppers, lettuce and cheese to it. I crush corn chips and let people add as much or as little as they like to the salad. I use sour cream and salsa on the side as everyone is different in what they prefer. I never put beans in this salad either.

was confused on if to drain the chili beans or not - huge amount of liquid (with french dressing and water) for 1 pound of meat?  I ended up NOT draining liquid from chili beans BUT used just over 2.5 puonds of ground beef.  Added only 1/3 of the water too.  GREAT FLAVOR with the whole combination....we put in taco bowls with fixings!  Definately will make again!

We love taco salad!.. I used refried bean in place of chili and saved the French dressing to top the lettuce; served with crushed Fritos corn chips, avacado, green onions, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and put it in taco bowls I made! :)

I used ground turkey and taco sauce instead of french dressing. So good! I chopped up some romaine and avacado and threw that in. I also used spicy chili doritos. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to make again!

Haven't had this recipe since the 70's.  The way everyone made it back then (TX) was with the dressing added to the meat as the sweetness of the dressing added or complimented the spiciness of the meat recipe.  And, the lettuce was always added to the hot meat mixture so that it would be limp.  I'm going to try it the other way but the original was supposed to be limp lettuce.

the taste was great. the presentation was terrible. once you mix it all together and it has sat for a few minutes it starts to look less than desirable. the next time I make it I will make it buffet style in order to preserve its eye appeal. It was incredibly easy to make. I used Catalina dressing as per other reviewers. I put the Nacho Dorito chips in each individual bowl to prevent sogginess. It was very tasty. My one child loved it. The other two weren't too impressed. My husband won't eat b/c he gets home and eats much later than we do and like I said it turns into a soggy mixture of lettuce, veggies, and ground beef. I will definitely do it buffet style next time.

This was very good.  Cut the french dressing in half and make it creamy french instead of plain french dressing.  Also decrease the water by half to make the meat thicker.  The most important thing you can do to make this the best possible, is to rip up some tortilla shells and fry them in a skillet with just enough oil to make them float.  Wait till they are crispy, and serve them warm.

I got rid of the chili beans, but everything else was wonderful!  I served the meat mixture, chips, and salad separately so we could have unsoggy leftovers the next day - and it tasted great both days!

I really didn't care for the French dressing taste.  IMO it messed up the "TACO" taste.  Husband really enjoyed it, though, he now prefers this version...sorry hon, not on my watch! :)

Very good but makes a ton. I needed more lettuce. Also, how the heck do you know when the bottle is 2/3 full? I think I overestimated because my dressing was a bit runny. I would make this again, it tastes good and went over very well at the party I brought it too. I also used doritos instead of tortilla chips.

This was a quick and delicous meal!  Start to seated at the table took no more than 30 minutes (OK, DH shredded my cheese and chopped the tomatoes, lol, so it might be a tad longer than that)  My kids just LOVED this.  DH was sceptical when he saw me dump in the entire bottle of Ken's Country French (neither of us are French dressing fans) but this was really good, and the entire family went back for seconds.  Definately a good meal!

Good Taco Salad.  The French dressing sort of threw me at first, but it was good.  Liked the idea of individual servings instead of tossing all together - better for any left overs that way, which there wasn't many.

My husband, oldest son and I loved it.  The two younger kids did not.  I would definitely leave the meat out and add it to the salad as needed because this recipes makes a TON!!!  The french dressing was a great twist, made the hamburger very tasty.

So simple.  The best taco salad I've tasted yet.  The french dressing made it just wonderful.  Will make it again.

I'm giving a 4 star because the taste was excellent. But, my caution to others is that I don't see where 15 min is enough time to cook this down. I had to cook down quite awhile as there is just so much liquid. As others suggested I did not mix all together either.  I made the salads individually so that any leftovers could still be used the next time. If it had been mixed together the salad and Doritos would have been way too wet to eat.

I really like this recipe but I see a number of negative reviews. It's all in the taste of the beholder. One reason why I like this site. Home cooks that take risks for the adventure of new things. I switch out the French dressing for Catalina dressing and add black beans. I let the dressing and water simmer out, cool down then refrigerate for an hour. Before serving, I add the lettuce, tomatoes a can of Rotel and Nachos. It's awesome!

We make a Taco Salad like this but use Western Dressing instead of French and Nacho Cheese Doritos instead of tortilla chips - much more flavor.

My husband and I both agree that the french dressing made the mixture too sweet and overpowered any "taco" taste we were expecting.  It wasn't bad but wasn't really good either.  Sorry, but will not be making this again.

Pretty much followed the recipe as is but used homemade taco seasoning and Dorito chips instead of plain tortilla. Topped it off with sour cream and salsa. Very good taco salad!

I omit the beans, salsa & sour cream & use Doritos. I use Light western salad dressing and use grd turkey instead of grd beef with low sodium taco seasoning and use a combo of green leaf lettuce and iceberg for a different twist.  Yum- everyone loves it

Always a favorite in our household. I mix the hamburger, taco seasoning, and the beans. Everything else is put in bowls, and everyone custom makes their own custom meal.

This is wonderful!  My DH is very very picky and I was worried he wouldn't care for it.  He loves it and at his request I added a can of MexiCorn and an avocado.  These are two of his favorite "add to Mexican recipes" items.

Amazing.  The only change I made was that I used black beans (rinsed) because I didn't have chili beans and used catalina cause I didn't have french.  All hot stuff on the bottom and cold added right at the end so it doesn't get soggy.  Amazinggggg!!!

Great dinner!!  Had to stop from stuffing myself!!  I do  make the full pan of sauce and meat, but divide it in half to mix with half the called for lettuce, cheese, etc.  That way I can save the other half of sauce for another night.  The full recipe makes a ton and if you don't eat it that night, it will get super soggy.

Very good recipe but I keep the meat on the side and everyone can add to their each individual serving. Mixing it up all together makes for not so good leftovers.

Agree with the reviewer below.  Too sweet.  Didn't like the french dressing.  I also don't like warm meat on my salad.  It wilted my salad.  Not going to make this again.  If I do, I will completely omit the french dressing.  Not necessary.

The Catalina dressing really adds flavor. Chop some green pepper, toss with Catalina, chill and use as a topper. Adds a nice crunchiness.
 I've treasured a recipe like this since the mid 1970's. It was called Taxco Salad.

I made the recipe EXACTLY as written.  Pour all that dressing into the pan?  I gritted my teeth and TRUSTED in the recipe.  What was I thinking???  The leftovers are in the fridge... not sure what the odds are that they'll ever be eaten.  So many great ingredients wasted...

Delicious! Added a can of corn and some black olives. I was worried that the meat mixture would be too runny because  in the pan, it was still very liquidy, but it turned out wonderfully.  It makes a ton in volume, so use a very big bowl to mix everything in. I used my huge silver bread mixing bowl to serve in. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe, but I did change a few things.  For one, I added only about 1/3 of the French dressing and less than a 1/2 cup of water to the ground beef.  I also made some taco rice from a mix (I think Lipton).  I made the meat mixure and rice about 2 hours before dinner - this way it was room temp and not hot as others have complained about.  To serve, I had individual bowls of mixed lettuces and baby spinach leaves.  Then I had separate bowls of sour cream, crushed chips, salsa, cheese, tomatoes, olives, meat mixture, and rice.  Everyone kind of just lined up and created their own individual customized salad.

I made this for my barbecue last night.  It was the last thing I made and the FIRST thing to disappear. Everyone loved it.  I didn't mix the dressing in while cooking.  I let the meat cool a bit then mixed the dressing in.  I then layered with the lettuce, sour cream, then cheese.  Lastly, I lightly crumbled a bag of Doritos and poured it over.  This will now be a regular in my home.

This was very yummy! Only changes I made was using catalina and only half the bottle. (I did cook it with the meat) I didn't use the beans and used the cheese doritoes and it was great! Once I was eating it I remembered I had this as a teenager at a friends house and loved it! It brought back nice memories.

This is a very delicious recipe! I don't really like French dressing and never would have though to use it like this, but it was great! I gave 4 stars only because there were a few changes. I noticed some reviewers said to add less water. I did that, AND I was using 1.5 lbs beef with onions and garlic, but it was still way to runny after simmering for nearly 25 minutes and I ended up having to drain it before adding to the salad. I would omit water completely next time.  I left out the chilis and added chopped black olives. And I would advise everyone to leave the chips completely separate as an "add your own" deal. Because it didn't take long for them to lose their crunch.

This is SO good. This is my second time making it and my husband and I both love it. The addition of the french dressing I would have never thought of, but it really adds a lot of flavor.  I did add a diced onion in with the ground beef while browning and a can of black beans in addition to the chili beans.  LOVE THIS...wish it wasn't so bad for me..haha :)

A very good salad. I used Catalina instead of French dressing, as suggested by another reviewer, as I don't care for French dressing. I gave this a four because taco seasoning doesn't need to come in a package and it's super easy to make...i followed taco seasoning 1 recipe. It was great. Thanks!

Wow!  This was wonderful!  However, I made a few changes to our liking.  Like others I used 1/2 a bottle of Catalina dressing and a little water, hot chili beans, dash of cayenne pepper(this just added an extra kick, not to spicy), added bell peppers (or onions) to the meat mix.  I made flour tortilla bowls and layered lettuce, beef mix, lettuce, beef mix, lettuce, cheese, salsa, green onions, olives and sour cream.  Thanks for the great meal!

This was really good.  Used kidney beans instead of chili beans, ground turkey instead of the ground beef, Taco flavored doritos for the corn chips and fat free catalina instead of French so I could use up what the ingredients that I already had.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good. I was craving a taco salad and wanted to use up some lettuce before it went bad. I liked it, but the dressing was a little too sweet... and I only used a half a bottle. Next time I may just use 1/4 a bottle or less. Also... the lettuce wilted which was expected, but not very appealing.

This was good, nothing spectacular, but a decent meal. I followed the suggestions and added Catalina dressing after I had assembled the salad. I also added olives and used Doritos instead of regular tortilla chips. The husband really enjoyed this but I doubt I make it again.

This is a great recipe. I substituted the French dressing for Catalina dressing and found it to be better. I only used about 2/3 of the bottle instead of the whole thing. Also this recipe make a lot so it is good for social events.

This is a good receipe. I liked it so much, that I now make it on a regular basis - but with modifications. I found the Catalina dressing too sweet, so I use Ranch instead. To me, this makes it taste even better.  My teenage kids love it and often request it!!

This was very very good stuff! I used Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols, Catalina dressing, Ranch style beans (drained), Santitos chips. I did not cook the Catalina dressing in the meat because my hubby asked me to keep the catalina separate. I mixed the sour cream and salsa together in a small bowl. I'm the only one here who wanted to assemble this salad all in 1 big bowl then serve it, but the rest of the family wanted it all separate to build it themselves. I never had taco salad with the beans before, and was a little skeptical, but it was good, it all got eaten and no one even said anything about beans in their taco salad. Overall, really great salad and easy to do. I will do this one again. Would be great for camping too.

This is awesome!!!  It really does make a ton, so cut the recipe in half if there are 4 of you.  I would still use the entire head of lettuce though because it needs more lettuce if you want it to be like a salad.  Also, don't add the chips to the lettuce until you are ready to serve it or they just get really soggy right away.

This recipe is good but I did a few variations until we got it how we really liked it.  Instead of French dressing we used Thousand Islands.  We also left out the chili and instead used a can of garbanzo beans and a can of kidney beans.  Everyone adds their own sour cream and salsa to taste.

We've been making a variation of this salad for years.   We use a can of drained Ranch Style beans instead of chili beans.  Catalina French instead of regular French.  And Fritos brand corn chips.  We also add a chopped onion. We only cook the meat with the seasoning mix and add the beans and dressing later kind of ala carte with the remaining items. We toss only the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheese  together and then keep all other ingredients seperate so people can add or not add the items they prefer.  A little of the dressing tossed in individual bowls with everything else is really the best way to get the flavor without overpowering the salad.  This is almost a standard for SuperBowl games in our group.

This is an awesome salad!!  But you have to use Catalina dressing and Doritos or it won't be the same.  I also used a can of light red kidney beans.  You also don't need as much dressing.  Very good potluck item!!

I had two parties in two days, so I made up a double batch.  I cooked the meat mixture the day before, divided it in half and refrigerated it.  I also used bagged salad.  Day of the party, I reheated the meat mixture just until warm and mixed all ingredients together when ready to serve.  It was a hit at both parties.  I've already been asked to bring it to another party!

I make a very similar version of this salad. The differance is I add the french dressing, along with the same size bottle of zesty Italian dressing, to the lettuce mixture just before I am going to serve it and mix well. I also let each person put the salsa and sour cream onto their own serving. Some like hot salsa and some like mild salsa.

This is a great recipe Denise!  The only thing I did different was I didn't add the crushed Doritos to the lettuce so that it wasn't soggy if there were leftovers.  If I was making it and I knew that it was all going to get eaten in the first sitting then I would add them!  Yummy!

Yummy! I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't use the whole bottle of French dressing- maybe about 3/4 of it. (I also used Honey French because that was what I had- it was great)
I would only use about 1/2 a cup of water or less. I would definitely let each individual add chips and toppings to keep from getting soggy and to cater to their taste. Over all, this was an excellent recipe and I will definitely make again. Thanks!

The twist the dressing gave it was just what I was looking for. I often make taco salad and will use this variation from now on. I didn't have French and used Russian instead. It was still great. I added onion to the ground beef when cooking. This was a great hit at my church dinner. Will be making often this summer.

Awesome, super tasty and easy to make but beware - it's sodium city.   I only used a 8 oz  bottle of catalina which I thought was more then enough.  I will will plan to make but will have to make  using low sodium black beans rinsed in place of the chili beans .  Unless I was serving for guests, I wouldn't use as many chips (or would use some low sodium ones) or mix the sour cream with the salsa.  So tasty and I really wish I could make 100% as is.  It's that good!!!

We like this pretty good but I think the proportions are a little bit high. Maybe we should've cut it in half.

Still it was pretty tasty! Would definitely make it again.

Anyways the only difference is we didn't do beans (because we didn't have any). My husband said he didn't really like beans in taco salad anyways though.

The whole family lived it. I used romain lettuce and added a handful of frozen corn. I served it in baked tortilla bowls. I put the hamburger/been chilli mix on top of the salad and topped it off with sour cream. I actually used far less salad dressing and cheese then the original recipe called for. It was a big hit with my fussy kids, they even asked for seconds and ate all their bowls too...

I actually tried this recipe. But I made some substitutions. I used groud chicken instead of the groun beef. And i omitted the beans. And used cool rnach doritos instead of regular tortilla chips. 

It was much loved!!!
Oh and i added avocados and sauteed onions and garlic.

Excellent recipe and oh so easy to put together quickly. 
I changed it a bit for my family. I added onions to the meat as well as raw onions in the salad. I didn't put beans in it or dressing. The salsa and sour cream was enough dressing. 
I used spicy nacho Doritos and I didn't mix in the meat. My family loves leftovers and the meat would have wilted the lettuce.
So I mixed up the lettuce, onion, tomatoes, cheese,Doritos,sour cream and salsa in a large bowl then each family member dished up themselves. So everyone could choose the meat veggie ratio they perfer.

Good recipe but it makes way too much.  With 3 adults & 2 kids we only ate about half the recipe and it was not very good warmed up the next day.  Would definitely make again but would cut the recipe in half.

I have been using a similar recipe for years.  Everyone who I've made it for loves it.  A few additions: 1/2 cup diced red onion with the lettuce and 2 avocados cut up. Also, using a clove of fresh garlic when frying the burger is excellent! I don't use any sour cream or salsa as the French dressing does not go well with it, and I use dark red kidney beans instead of chili beans.  Also, using Nacho Cheese Doritos is " The Bomb"!!

This was one of the first recipes I learned to make in home economics class! I absolutely loved it then and still do today! I knew this wouldn't keep well, so I halved everything and had NO leftovers (between myself, my husband and my parents, the bowl was licked CLEAN!!!)! As many others have done, I also made a few changes. To add a little zip, I substituted nacho flavored Doritos for plain tortilla chips, added a few handfuls of chopped scallions and cut way back on the dressing. I prepared my meat per the directions on the back of my taco seasoning packet and added the dressing LAST. All I can say is WOW! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Denise. It brought back many fond memories for sure! :-)

This is just HORRIBLE! It is a soggy, sloppy mess. The Chili Beans and the French dressing totally ruined it. Crushing the tortilla chips up, is just stupid.

I like trying ingredients that don't seem to belong together like taco meat and French dressing. I read through some reviews and saw that some people thought the dressing made it too sweet and left it greasy. While I was cooking my burger I did think an entire bottle would be too much so I added a little less than half. I added 1/3 c. water and let simmer. It did have a 'grease film' that collected in spots which I would guess was from the oil in the dressing. We enjoyed the flavor and thought if more dressing was added, it would have been too overpowering. We enjoyed that it was a little different from the everyday norm. Thanks!!!

I made this with Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage and I don't know WHY I thought that Italian sausage, French dressing and taco seasoning would go good together... The meat itself was.... too sweet and weird tasting. Adding it all together took away some of that so it wasn't TOO bad, but we all ate a tiny bitt. Perhaps I'll try again with regular ground beef. We have taco salad all the time, just never with french dressing. That was a new one on me.

I really didn't like the flavor of the French dressing in this and I would not recommend cooking your meat in it, it created an incredible amount of grease in my pan.  This would be better with thousand island dressing tossed in with everything at the end.

I made this for a cookout this past weekend and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes. I browned the hamburg and added the taco seasoning as directed on the package. Then let it cool. I added in Catalina dressing, about 3/4 of the bottle, to the salad not in with the meat. I used kidney beans, added some red onion, and crushed Doritos (instead of plain tortilla chips) over the top so they didn't get too soggy mixed in. I also left out the salsa and sour cream. Definitely will make it again. FYI- the salad fills a 13x9 aluminum pan.

I know people hate this as I do myself but I wanted to share the way I make this. I have not made this recipe so cannot really rate it. I also use doritos instead of tortilla chips, and instead of french dressing I use zesty catalina. I don't use  beans, sour cream or salsa and its still good. but thats just me. I do add cucumbers and red and green peppers. I know some people said they didn't like it with the french dressing, try it with the catalina maybe you will like it better. I hope I could help, and didn't upset anyone in the process.

Good.  Kept things separate as I knew I would have leftovers and didn't want chips/lettuce to get soggy.  Only used 1/2 bottle of french.  I liked it, husband didn't like it with french.

I have been making Taco Salad for years.  I don't simmer my meat with the beans and dressing, though. I brown the meat, drain it, let it cool, then add the taco seasoning mix. I also use Ranch dressing instead of French.  When I first found this recipe it called for Wish Bone California Onion dressing.  That has long since be discontinued, so I find that Ranch is the nearest substitute. I usually have the sour cream on the side, but find the salsa unnecessary.  Every time I make this for a pot luck, or family gathering, it's one of the first things to disappear.

I made this salad exactly as directed and for me it didn't turn out. The entire bottle of salad dressing heated up with the meat and beans then dummped onto the lettuce. Then add the sour cream and salsa and what I ened up with was a goopy over dressed mess that immediately became soggy. If I made this again I for sure wouldn't use the entire bottle of dressing as it was WAY too much and I would probably cool the meat/bean mix down some so it didn't wilt the lettuce because we like our lettuce salads to have crispy lettuce.

i thought it was pretty delicious! the only thing i didnt like was i thought it was kind of greasy. i didnt use all of the recommended dressing, but everything else i followed the same! i ended up having to drain some of the grease or fat out of it before i served it. BUT besides that it was good! i'm sure i'll make it again!
EDIT: it was SO good as leftovers!! i didnt mix the lettuce and chips in with it. so it wasnt soggy or anything. it was delicious

The French dressing was a nice tangy twist.  I'm on a diet so I left the cheese & sour cream off my serving and just poured some meat mixture over lettuce and I still thought it was very tasty.  As someone else mentioned, I did not use quite as much water.

I am going to assume that I messed this up, but I am a pretty good cook (or at least good at following a recipe) I d k what happened! I did use catalina and doritios?? I skipped the tomato! I d k!  I brought it to a cookout, like 2 peeps tried it (me being one) I opted to throw in the trash after the cookout! It must have been a screw up on my part but I can find where!!!

Great recipes with TONS of flavor.  I made changes as my cupboard allowed - black beans instead of chili, Catalina Dressing instead of French - and it still tasted fabulous.  I recommend using only 1/3 bottle of water (not 2/3 bottle) because the beef/bean mixture was a little soupy.

I made this recipe this evening with very little modifications and it was a winner in my household.  My picky 6 and 11 year olds liked it, but did not care for the sweetness of the French dressing.  I only used 8oz of french dressing and about 6 oz of water.  I will make this recipe again but may omit French dressing and top the salad off with Ranch dressing instead of salsa.

Way to sweet made as is.  I will try again with added onion to the hamburger and adding the dressing on top individually to control the sweetness.  It wasn't horrible, just sweeter than my family cared for.

I like the idea of this but not the execution.  Between the taco seasoning, the French dressing and the Doritos (which I added instead of the prescribed tortilla chips), it tasted really processed to me, and loaded with sodium.  I did like the crunch that the chips offered to the salad.

This was good.  I made a few changes - I used half a bottle of fat free Catalina dressing and hot chili beans to add some zing.  Also, I did not mix all the ingredients together so the lettuce would not get soggy.  We just assembled the salad when it was time to eat.  Added chopped onions to the toppings and used corn chips instead of tortilla chips.  This is a great recipe to "clean out the fridge."

I've never tried Taco Salad before when I made this so I wasn't sure what to expect. I am a huge taco fan though! So I decided to make it for my food and nutrition class. Everyone in the class loved it!!!! I know another group also tried Taco salad but used a different recipe and they said it could not even compare to this! I recommend it! Sooo tasted!

I seriously think the facts of this recipe are terrible.  I'm sorry but ommitting certain items constitutes an entirely different recipe.  When you make this recipe exactly as it is, it turns out quite terrible and extremely fattening as it is difficult to find a low fat French dressing.

this was so good! I substituted romaine for lettuce and added sliced black olives to the salad base.  The dressing made a nice "sauce" so the salad wasnt too dry! Will try again!

This is my favorite taco salad recipe ever!  I mix together everything except for the tortilla chips and sour cream.  I then let people dress the salad as they want.  This makes sure that the tortilla chips don't get soggy.  My favorite!!!

I added onions and fresh jalepenos to mine. I also added a lot of garlic powder as well, also instead of corn chips I added zesty taco doritos at the end after i had all the meat mixed together and everything else. I keep the chips and lettuce separated until it's time to eat so it doesn't get soggy.

I thought that this recipe was a decent base, but came out a bit bland, but all in all not bad.  I will make it again, but maybe add a little kick - some jalapenos.  Thanks for the good recipe for parties and pot lucks - and easy easy easy to make.

I deviated a bit from this recipe but used most of the same ingredients. Instead of Catalina dressing I used a Chipotle Ranch which was really good with this salad and black and pinto beans instead of the chili beans and that goes good as well. Very good recipe though!

Very good, I used spicy french dressing and generic doritos.  I did it bowl by bowl, instead of putting it all in one bowl.  I added some sour cream to.  So good!

This was really, really good, though I did make some changes. I didn't use the French dressing at all. I followed the directions on the taco seasoning packet to make the meat. For the salad I added olives and was very generous with the sour cream. We also used the Nacho Doritos as suggested by others. It turned out really well. My daughter it really looking forward to having the leftovers tonight.

Love this salad!  My family practically begs for it!  I only use half the dressing, and it's still great!  I also mix up half the recipe and have the rest for the next day.

This was good for me but not great.  I did follow other reviewers advice not to add the whole bottle of dressing to the meat/bean mixture.  I only added about 1/4 cup and let people top their salad with as much as they liked.  I can't even imagine how this would be if you used the entire bottle.  I also only added a little less than a cup of water.  I let this mixture simmer for about 25 minutes and the consistency was fine.  I let it cool a bit before adding to my mixture of romaine, iceburg, green onions, and sliced olives.  I put the sour cream and salsa on the side as well.  I think my problem with it may have been the taco seasoning.  I'm just not a big fan of the packaged stuff.  I think it would be better with different seasonings.

This recipe was wonderful. I made a couple changes. I let the meat mixture cool a bit before adding it to the lettuce mixture. I used Russian dressing instead of the french to cut down on the sweetness. I'll make this one again.

I gave it three stars, because while it tasted good, I was not crazy about a warm taco salad, I think I just prefer mine cold.   Adding the dressing the the meat while it cooked and then pouring it over the salad, just seemed to make it a bit too mushy, I don't think my family was crazy about the appearence of the salad.   I wouldn't mind trying it all seperate though like others suggested.

What a great recipe! I was so skeptical about the french dressing, but it was really great. I did take the advice about using Catalina french dressing and Nacho Doritos. Since I only made it this way, I don't know what it would be like the original way. I guess it would be wonderful either way. All 6 of us loved it...even the littlest ones.

Made my own variation ommiting the tomatoes and salad dressing and adding some coarsely chopped carrots for crunch.  Very good, if not exactly healthy.  I think I will add beans to tacos in future, good idea.

I have used this recipe over and over.  I've worked with MR clients in group homes over the past 10 years and this salad is a hit with all of them.  They love it and they get a kick of putting it together themselves.  Thanks so much.

Great recipe--We mixed some ranch with sour cream like one of our neighborhood Mexican restaurants does and it is really delicious.  We used that instead of the French dressing

I made this with honey french dressing that you get by the salads.  It was awesome! It had the sweet, yet spicy taste that everyone raved about.  I will make this a part of my "Family Favorite" recipes.  Thank you!

Fun recipe for taco salad.  I didn't want that many calories/fat in mine, so I only added about 1/3 cup French dressing.  We served over lime tostitos and it was tasty.

I really liked this recipe.  It is fast and easy.  I did however make a few changes.  I use Texas stlye beans and I did not add the French dressing to the meat.  I eliminated the water and place the dressing as an aside.  Each person can use what they like or not use it. It is just as good with just the Sala and sour cream.

The flavor of the finished dish was really good. I only gave it four stars because I feel like the proportions of ingredients are off a little bit. I felt like it had a lot of chips, and even then they got soggy pretty quickly. I also felt like it didn’t have enough lettuce. I think I will use some of the other reviewer‘s ideas as far as adding onion green pepper and black olives next time. I might also try with the nacho cheese Doritos too. All in all I thought this was a great starter recipe and I can’t wait to put some tweaks on it.

Followed one of the other reviews and added Catalina dressing.  Also used ground turkey.  A big zero for pink colored meat.   
Taste is superb.   
Big Hit we'll do it again.  Thank you.

This recipe is amazing! We have made it several times. However, this last time, we decided to leave out the lettuce and chips from the rest and add as needed to each serving. This allows for fresh lettuce and crunchy chips for left overs!!!

When I saw the ingredient list I thought to myself, "Wow. That's either gonna be great or disgusting." Let me tell you it's great! I used bagged salad mix and just half a bottle of French dressing. I didn't add the additional salsa.  A combo I never would have thought of turned out to be a new fav.

Finally found the recipe that my mother used growing up that she got out of a magazine, or at the very least almost identical! The only changes she made was that she used Frito's instead of Doritos chips because they held up better under the moisture so they stayed crunchy long enough to finish eating and she used a drained can of kidney beans instead of chili beans. I do think she added the salad dressing cold or room temp to the lettuce mixture and maybe used half the amount called for here. Then waited until right before serving to add the chips. But overall this is most definitely the closest recipe I have found to hers! We loved it! O think it was in good housekeeping or something, I don't remember. She was always getting simple, yummy recipes from her magazines and playing with them lol.

Made it tonight 5/29/19 for dinner. My wife loves it. I used taco flavored Doritos instead of tortilla chips and I like onions so I cut up an onion as a side to add instead of cooking it in the dish. Super quick, easy and flavorful meal to put together. I like it because it has unlimited options. Thanks Denise for sharing. A family favorite for sure!

This was delicious. I made a double batch and the whole family (hubby + four kids, ages 2-8) gobbled it up. There wasn't a crumb leftover. I only had one bottle of french dressing, but the flavor still came through and I figured it would be [slightly] healthier that way anyway :)

This was a delicious meal that everyone in the house enjoyed. I like to make my own seasoning so I used a recipe right from this site.  I didn't have French dressing so I used Thousand Island's and it was still very yummy.

It was a great recipe! The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the French dressing. Next time I will be using about half of what the recipe calls for. It was way too sweet for us. A friend of mine also made this recipe but used a salad mix (from a bag) instead of a head of the iceberg lettuce and it gave it a good flavor as well.

Loved it - made as written except that I had black beans on hand and used those.   Even the kids liked it.  I personally would like a little more kick, but that is likely the fualt of the taco seasonings I used and so I'll have to play with that a bit.  Kept leftovermeat separate to mix up salads for lunch this week.

Absolutely one of our faves - we love this salad. I lighten this up a bit with fat free dressing, lean beef or turkey, and other fat free subs when I can.

Delicious!  I let the meat and bean  mixture simmer for about 45 minutes as it seemed very liquidy; most of the liquid cooked out and the consistency was perfect after that.

It tasted very well, but it was too soupy and drowned on French dressing. Instead of mixing all the veggies I'd keep it separate from the meat/bean combo and make tacos or burritos out of it. That would keep the lettuce and stuff more crisp.

It was ok but did not taste like the usual Taco salad you get at a Mexican restaurant. I used Zesty Catalina salad dressing which helped with the flavor. Catalina or French salad dressing is way too sweet. Next time I will try it with  the Taco sauce instead of the salad dressing.

Really enjoyed this. I made some substitutions to healthy it up just a bit. Used ground turkey, half a packet of reduced sodium taco seasoning, and maybe 1/3 of the bottle of dressing instead of the whole thing. I didn’t add water. I threw in some black olives because I had them on hand. I also used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Oh, and I used Catalina dressing. Very good, and I was surprised by the Catalina dressing - it added just a bit of a tang that was really yummy!

We love this recipe and only change how it’s served. We serve the chips, topped with the meat and bean mixture, then the veggies, cheese and salsa. That way we can use leftovers.

I didn't put a ton of French dressing in it (like 2 tablespoons) its pretty rich and could go without it. Make sure to cut up the lettuce well. I really liked it, will be making it again.

We liked it. I didn’t use as much dressing as called for. Added onions while browning meat. Added avocado to the lettuce mixture. It had a lot of flavor.

I added chopped onion and a can of corn to the meat mixture but  I didn't put the dressing in the meat...put it on individual salads and mixed in. I didn't use Russian dressing, used Hidden Valley Chipotle Ranch instead! It's definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe, my mother used to make this for us when we were kids back in the 1980's.  I make it for my family now as well :)  The only thing that I do different is technique wise..  I set it up like a taco bar, so individuals can put the meat on with or without beans, choose their own dressing, and they can go with Dorito Nacho Flav, or plain yummy tortillas, whatever floats their boat :)  The great thing about this recipe is it is sooo versatile!  Everyone can walk away happy!

I used lean ground turkey and Dennison's 98% fat free turkey chili beans. I didn't mix the tomato, cheese, or lettuce in it until it was time to serve. I didn't mix in the chips at all. Also, I threw chives on top along with the dollop of sour cream on top . Very quick and easy recipe. I will make it again!

Delicious. I added a half of a small chopped onion to the ground beef while browning. I also roasted three ears of corn, knifed off the cobb and added to the salad. I noticed the dressing was a little watery, next time I wont add as much water, the dressing alone should be enough. Otherwise, loved it.

Loved the flavor the Catalina dressing/taco seasoning gave to the beef mixture (only used half the bottle which was plenty) .  Added onions and black olives.  Next time might put some guac on top as well as the sour cream and salsa.  Really easy and tasty recipe.

This was exactly what I wanted when I was craving taco salad today, crazy delicious and my husband gobbled it up too! I did find that I didn't need all the meat mixture, it was pretty wet. The only other problem is that it made way more than we could eat but after you mix it all you have to eat it immediately, does NOT keep well. Next time I will keep the chips/lettuce separate and combine it as I need it because that is a lot of food to waste :(

Had good flavor but there are a couple changes I would make the next time I make this. The ships & lettuce get soggy quickly so next time I will add these two items in the individual serving portions. This would work out much better if you have any left overs. Other than that we really liked the dish.

I didn't have any french dressing, so left that out. I also just had the cheese on the side, and made it optional to add in if anyone wanted it since my daughter is lactose intolerant. I also used corn chips instead of tortilla chips. It was great! :-)

I made this tonight with a few changes because we like taco salad a bit spicy. This was delish! I will try again with the Catalina dressing.

Not a fan of the dressing but who knew until we tried it?  Better idea is  mixing a good ranch dressing with equal amount of salsa and mix with the greens.

I didn't use beans (my husband is not a fan) and added black olives instead. I did use less French dressing because there were no beans, maybe just a little more than half the bottle, and used just one cup of water. The next time I make this salad, I'll add more dressing and save the chips for last. We made this ahead of time and didn't think about soggy chips. :( Overall it had a decent taste and was easy to make!

I doubled this recipe to serve 8 people as a dinner main. I'm glad I did, everyone went for 2nd's and then we ran out. it was delicious. I used Famous Taco Seasoning recipe in place of store bought taco seasoning and omitted the flour, My daughter has Celiac, and can't have any gluten, I only used 1/4 the French dressing and let everyone put on more if they wanted to. I also used sweet yellow tomato and a pinch of chili flakes for some heat in place of pepper sauce because that's what I had on hand. I also left everything separate from the meat mixture and tossed each individual serving as I plated it to keep things from getting soggy. I will definitely make this again. Probably on a regular basis.

Made it with ground Turkey meat instead of beef.  I thought the addition of the French dressing and the water added was a bit much.  Ended up with a soupy mixture.  I think I would omit the can of chilli next time, use half as much French dressing and no added water.  Mixing the lettuce, cheese and tomatoe together first was a nice idea.  The family loved it and we all ate way too much.

The family loved this! I was skeptical about mixing taco and French dressing, but it was great. We eat taco salad a couple times a month and will add this recipe to the regular menu.  The only thing I did differently was no beans and added frozen Mex Chipolte corn to the meat.

This was pretty good but was missing something to me.  I will have to try it again and figure it out.  I did use Doritos, maybe I should try the other as mentioned in recipe.  Love the dressing.  I think it makes more than 8 servings personally.

French dressing is way too strong.  Adding much less of it would probably improve the taste and consistency.

My mom has always made a bomb taco salad. I have never been able to find one that even comes close to it. I tried this one because I wanted to see how it worked with the French dressing.. It was delicious. My entire family loved it. My kids are hard to please, so when they eat it, I know something is good.

Followed the recipe exactly except I topped lettuce and chips at the dinner table so I could have leftovers without soggy chips and lettuce.  YUM.  Kids loved it.  Might use more spicy taco seasoning next time. LOVE!

Just created this to take to an Easter pot luck today!  I had a little too much for the big bowl, so I through some together for the hubs and he is devouring it now.  He loves it... I waited to add the meat/beans mixture until making his plate, then added salsa and sour cream to it once it was on the plate.  He loved it!

I liked this and I didn't really change much. The beef mixture was a little watery but I just used a slotted spoon when I spooned it onto the iceberg lettuce. I was afraid  the dressing might be too sweet or tangy but it actually wasn't. This is a nice easy mid-week dinner to make when you don't have alot of time and you can easily adapt this recipe to your own tastes. I had some avocados and mixed them up with the taco salad mixture along with a little red onion. Oh and instead of chili beans I used black beans because I like them better. I'm sure you could use any beans you like! My whole family enjoyed this.

Have used this recipe for years! Yummy!! Usually DO NOT combine ingredients, as some of the kids don't like various ingredients. Make it a salad bar and add: black olives, red onion or green onion, sour cream and any more of your favorites! The meat mixture keeps better,  the veggies don't wilt or run together!, AND the chips stay crunchy!! The kids LOVE it!,

Looks gross! Skip the taco seasoning as it's got tons of chemicals and preservatives in it. You can make your own. Same with the French dressing. Bottled dressings full of chemicals and preservatives. And iceberg lettuce has zero nutritional value. Change that to a green leaf or romaine. Seriously!

Did not like this recipe at all. Personally, I think there is no need for the French dressing... Just use taco seasoning to cooked lean meat and add the rest of the ingredients. Optional ingredients to taste would be sour cream & beans...but cheese, onions and taco chips are a MUST to the meat mixture and lettuce...JMVHO...

I have made this salad for every picnic and funeral and family gathering since I got it from a friend in the 1980's with 2 exceptions. I use Western dressing and kidney beans.  It is always a hit.

Very tasty! I did not use the dressing...didn't need it. However, I did cut up a lime and squeezed the fresh juice onto the salad. Wonderful! Easy! My husband said MAKE IT AGAIN! :)

I have made this recipe but i don't ever use french dressing. I take a bottle of Italian dressing and put half of the pack of seasoning in the dressing and the other half in the ground beef. It is very good.

This was good.  My husband loved it.  He never eats leftovers, but had this for lunch the next day.  I'm not sure if the salad dressing is necessary.  I think it would be just as good without it.  I mixed chili and pinto beans and added Doritos as others suggested.  I will make again.

That was the best Taco salad we ever had! We loved the french dressing in it combined with the ground beef and the chilli beans. A plus is that the sour cream and the salsa is allready inside, it makes it really good!

really fast and easy to make.  I substituted Catalina dressing for the french and used Nacho Dorritos.  I added the water and simmered for 20 minutes and it never thickened up.  I ended up straining the beef and beans out to add to the salad.  taste was good but not excellent

My family didn't care for this at all. The French dressing made the taco meat very greasy and they tasted like French dressing, not tacos.

My family LOVES this recipe!  We used to make "regular" tacos all the time but they ask for this instead.  I usually don't use the entire bottle of dressing but pretty close to it.  My mom made it once & used the entire bottle, still very good.  It's just a matter of personal taste!  Wonderul recipe!

This was ok.  It was very saucy, and it doesn't last  more than a few hours (of course - it turns soggy).    I made the entire recipe, but only mixed 1/2 of everything for dinner, and then stored the meat sauce separate from the other ingredients, and then re-put everything together for the leftovers which seemed to me to be too much work.  I don't think I would make this again.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe. However, I found it a tad bit too sweet and the french dressing flavor was overwhelming. If I make it again I will only use an 8 oz bottle of dressing or no salad dressing at all.

Loved the one dish  meal.  Listened to others and used Catalina, not a whole bottle though, maybe a cup, and then crushed up nacho doritoes. Served jalapenos and sour cream on side.  Leftovers though that I am sure no one will eat as the Doritoes will be soggy.

I've made this twice, and it was great both times.  The second time, I added double the amount of taco seasoning and used Doritos (the taco/chipotle ones), and it was absolutely the best!  I'll definitely make it that way from now on.

This was so soggy and just not very good. I personally will never make this again. I think the suggestion to plate the salads separately would help with the soggy texture but unfortunately that won't help with the taste.

This is a favorite at our place.  We've made it 15-20 times over the last year and I actually crave it pretty often.  It's delicious, filling and easy to make.  

I use about 1/2 the french dressing to save calories.  I also add green peppers and green onions.  We've also thrown in some whole wheat pasta instead of chips to make it healthier - it seemed a bit strange, but was actually really good!

The basic recipe was very good. I did not use a whole bottle of salad dressing. I followed the recipe on the back of the taco seasoning packet. For the last step of the directions I added 1/4 cup dressing and the beans.

I used a can of drained diced tomatoes because I did not have any tomatoes on hand. I also added green peppers for some crunch. 

Lastly, I added chips per serving bowl so they would not get soggy.

Very good recipe. I had a taco salad at a work luncheon that I wanted to recreate for my family. This recipe did the trick. It is easy to prep and a nice alternative to traditional groundbeef recipes.

We're talking about a taco salad - so not really the most tasty thing in the world to start off with.  This recipe was good.  I only used 1/2 the bottle of dressing and used Catalina instead of French b/c the store didn't have French.  I also laid all the fixings out like a buffet so everyone could make their salad how they wanted it.

The French dressing didn't really make sense with the rest of the ingredients; it kind of takes away from the Mexican taste that I expect.  It was okay for me, but not great...I probably won't make this again.

My husband it a meat and potatoes guy but he loved this recipe, and I must admit it was awesome. Probably the best recipe I have found. Was not sure what chili beans were so I used black beans.

I used western dressing instead of french, and this was a huge hit.  will add this to the permanent recipe box.

I didn't add the dressing at all. I also didn't put all the items in one bowl. Instead I just put the toppings out and stuff so others could put what they wanted on.

Made this with a few modifications to take to a cinco de mayo party.  I used ground chicken and ground beef, used kidney beans instead of chili because of preference and nacho flavored dorito's.  this was great and went over perfect.  I put some sour cream, tomotatoes and dressing on the side to avoid the soggy syndrome.  It's kind of hard to mess up a taco salad but this was really good!

I was looking for a good taco salad...and guess I will have to keep on looking. I was a bit skeptic on the french dressing, and when I made this recipe, neither my husband or I cared for it.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  My daughter liked it better than the old way I made taco salad.  She said, from now on she will  look forward to taco   night.

I, personally, did not care too much for this taco salad. I thought the French dressing took away the "taco" flavor that I like. But my husband liked this.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I MADE IT FOR A BIRTHDAY FIESTA.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  I DOUBLED THE RECIPE, AND IT REALLY DOES MAKE A LOT!!  I REALIZED AFTER THE PARTY THAT I DIDN'T DOUBLE THE FRENCH DRESSING! STILL WAS SO DELICIOUS!  EAT IT UP THE SAME DAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T KEEP OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THE LETTUCE AND CHIPS GET SOGGY.  I MADE SOFT TACOS FOR THE KIDS (HAD ALL THE SAME INGREDIENTS)! SURPRISINGLY, MY HUSBAND AND FATHER LOVED IT THE MOST.  LOOK NO FURTHER THIS IS THE RECIPE YOU WANT!

We loved this recipe,
A little worried at first about all the French dressing it calls for, but it really gave it a great taste.
Thanks for sharing this recipe
