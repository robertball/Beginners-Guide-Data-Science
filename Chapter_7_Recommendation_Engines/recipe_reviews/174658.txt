There are many ways to improve this taco recipe. As a Mexican, I almost cringed looking at this recipe. It's really not that hard to make it the right way but a lot of people assume it is. First off, don't buy canned beans, that's just full of preservatives, salt and processed chemicals. To make refried beans just mash cooked (boiled beans) with a little oil for flavor along with salt. For the meat, don't add seasoning, just sautee garlic, onion, tomato and then add meat to pan to cook and then add each spice as you like. Guacamole does not have sour cream and it includes avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, lime, lime zest, jalapeno salt and pepper.  Also, tortillas for tacos should really be corn tortillas for the authentic Mexican taste. If you want hard shell tacos simply place meat in the tortilla and fry over a pan on each side until crispy. You can also make taquitos this way by wrapping tortilla like a flute and securing with a toothpick while frying. Finally, please use queso fresco, a moist crumbly Mexican cheese, you wont be sorry. Hope this helpas and motivates people to make homemade tacos the way a Mexican family would. =)

I spread the refried beans on the soft shell and then put in in the microwave for about 15-20 seconds to soften up the shell without drying it out too much before surrounding the hard shell.  I like mine with queso, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. My hubby likes lettuce, tomato, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, and taco sauce on his.   Also, as it indicates in the ingredients list by specifying a size, it is quite important that you use the right size soft shells that fit the size of the hard shells so you don't have too much or too little outside coverage.  Great recipe!

These are great for people that like Taco Bell's double decker. Same basic principle applies - don't wait too long to eat or the crunch is history!

It is beyond me why people like reviewer Robert makes such ridiculous posts. You don't need to add such ignorant comments. Please act like an adult....geez.

Great recipe, my husband liked it very much.

Probably the best Taco I've ever had...My son & I always differed on the choice of hard Tacos (him), vs soft Tacos (me) - this recipe takes care of both. Couldn't find a ripe fruit for the guacamole so I cut it into tiny pieces & mixed with sour cream and lime juice. Very, very tasty and without the mess!

These were very good and fun to make!  A different twist to our taco night.  I did not make the gaucamole because the avocados at the store were very hard!  Aside from that, the recipe turned out great.  I will be making this again!

Took the idea and made it the same way I make our favorite tacos. I'm not sure if we'll ever go back to the old way.

Husband is a taco junkie and LOVED this.  We have eaten Taco Bells version, just never thought to do it at home.  Thank you for the idea.  The hard shells didn't explode and we were able to fit more stuff into each taco.

I made tacos this way,but used taco sauce instead of the dry seasonings packet for tacos. It always makes it so much better,and no migraines.

These were sooooooo good. I followed the directions except I didn't add the taco seasoning to the refried beans. The shells held together very well and didn't move around using the beans. I did make mine using guacamole on the soft tortilla shell, and stuffed the hard taco shell with refried beans topped with all the fixings, but it did get VERY messy and the soft shell moved all over the place while I was eating!!! But it was still very good and a good way to make this meatless. (If you use veg. refried beans of course) I think this is how we will make our tacos from now on!! Thanks.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and they were amazing.  Next time I will tweak some things but this was delicious and we all filled ours with our own selection of toppings.  I can speak for all the mothers of teenage boys when I say this fills them up faster than normal tacos.  My son was so excited that I was making a Taco Bell food that he actually helped me make them - that is a first, but hopefully a start to him being interested in cooking. My husband said they were just tacos with a tortilla on it - but he is hard to please so he doesn't count. Enjoy this great recipe!

This is almost exactly the way I've been making them for years.  What a great way to have the crunchy taco and not have it fall all over your shirt!  My grown up children still make them for their families.  Hmmm.  Makes me hungry!

5 stars for concept, however, I do like some others and use my own spicy homemade refried's (I make large batch and freeze in smaller portions). Since I cook for two I use way less of everything, but...I do spinkle some crumbled Queso on the layer of beans and I use shredded Chihauhau cheese. I also use my own blend of spices for the meat as I don't like the packaged stuff. I haven't ever used Guac but if I decide to use avocodo at some point, I think I will dice it up and toss with sprinkle of lemon or lime and a bit of salt. Instead of plain tomato I use Pico De Gallo I've made. Using fresher ingredients & more authentic cheeses elevates the "Bell" version. If your soft tortillas are too big... trim them down to fit...makes strips out of leftover and fry em up & sprinkle with some seasoning of choice if you don't want to throw that excess away. I love these because your corn tortilla stay put in the layer of beans/soft tortilla and they just taste good! Very easy to sub ingredients/technique to your liking.

These were pretty good, a neat idea. I did take a couple of shortcuts, just chopped up the avocado and used it like that instead of making the "guacamole" and I just microwaved the beans to heat them through. I also chose to use Tostitos brand queso dip instead of shredded cheddar cheese, but just because I happened to have some. This would be good too with cheese melted on the flour tortilla instead of beans, like Taco Bell's cheesey gordita crunch :)

This is something my husband always does when we have tacos at home.  I never considered it to be a recipe per se.  I use all the taco seasoning in the meat and just heat up the can of beans, no additional ingredients necessary.  You CAN of course add the water and spices to the beans, but why add an extra step? :)  I don't heat the tortilla shells but do heat the flour tortillas in the microwave.  Double decker tacos are definitely good!  Also we use more than 2 T of each ingredient, that would make for some skimpy tacos.

Very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed and my husband and I had no complaints EXCEPT that we wished we'd used a low sodium taco seasoning packet.  We don't cook with a lot of salt normally, and the seasoning packet, while tasty, was tremendously salty.  Live and learn!  Still, a very, very tasty double decker taco recipe.

Why do you add water to the can of refried beans?  This created a soup.  Then when you put this soupy mixture around the hard taco it turns it into a soft taco within minutes.  What a waste of calories.  I did like the guac though.  I like sour cream in my avocado.

As a south Texas resident for most of my life, I just want to say that while this recipe may not be "authentic Mexican", it's very tasty and probably appealing to most Americans. lbgardea, if you don't like the recipe, don't cook it. Or better yet, post your own please. cattfm303, thanks for the tasty recipe.

This was good, but it could have been better. When we have taco's we've used the refried bean method and used Fajita seasons by McCormick.  Unfortunately I was hoping to get my family into eating taco's and this didn't do it.  Thanks for the meal though.

What a great idea! In our family, we are split between hard and soft tacos so I always have both but it never occurred to me to layer them. I made a different version of the guacamole and used homemade taco seasoning, and made some other changes to suit our tastes, but the method is the same. These are filling, my hubby usually puts away 5-6 tacos, but after 3 of these he was content! Love that you get the nice crunch without the taco falling apart in your hands.

My son always loved the "popular franchise" version of this, so we've always had the fixin's available to make them this way, anytime we have tacos.  The only thing we don't do is to add the taco seasoning to the refried beans. However; we use refried beans w/ green chilies. I warm the hard shells in my toaster oven, while the soft tortillas are warmed in the micro.

To create an authenticly ground meat mixture, I put my cooked ground beef in my food processor until it is ground to a nice meal texture.  To eliminate as much of the fat as possible I also place it in a sieve or collander and pour boiling water over it very slowly, BEFORE grinding it in the processor.  It does not affect the flavor at all.  The easiest way to do this is to put shreaded paper or newspaper in a very large pot and set the collander over it.  The paper absorbs the water and grease for easy disposal.  GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks for sharing it!

Instead of of pkg taco seasoning, I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this site, adding about 1-1/2 TBSP to the meat and did not add any seasoning to the beans.  Unfortunately, the guacamole sauce lacks flavor.  I added additional sour cream and seasonings, but it's just a garnish and isn't necessary unless you really like guacamole. I can't say enough about these. They are so easy to eat without making a mess.

Made this exactly as called for, but it didn't quite turn out as I'd hoped.  The recipe is a good idea and can be easily adapted to fit all tastes!  My problem I had, was the 2/3 cup of water was WAY too much for the beans.  They turned out watery and weren't spreadable.   So I just mixed it in with the taco meat and used it that way.  I also bought soft tortillas that were too big, so that was a little frustrating as well.  Buy the smallest tortillas that come in a pkg. of 20 and they will fit perfectly around the hard shells.  Then reduce the amount of water added to the beans by half.  I, also, prefer lemon juice instead of lime in the guacamole.  HOWEVER, all in all, this is an excellent recipe worth repeating and adding your own flair to.

Awesome idea.  We loved it.  Instead of making guacamole I just cut up avocado.  I also cut up olives, onions, and romaine lettuce. Really yummy.  I also added 2 minced garlic cloves to the ground beef.  I used a tiny bit of taco seasoning and seasoned the rest with a teaspoon of chili powder, season pepper, and garlic salt.  I topped them with shredded jack cheese, sour cream, and green chili Verde sauce.  Yummy

I made these last year and my family loved it.  For my kids' birthdays, I always make them whatever they want.  When I asked my youngest what he wanted for his birthday meal he asked "Can you make those hard tacos with the soft ones and the beans?"  I followed the directions as written and we have a winner!  Thank you!

We love this recipe!  The avocados in my store were hard as a rock, so we had to skip that. Would have been even better with that addition.  We love refried beans, however, and it worked great as a glue to keep the hard and soft tacos together. Really yummy and easy to throw together.  I used the box of Taco Bell hard and soft shells and the packet of seasoning that came with it.  Usually try to make my own taco seasoning, but was in a hurry last night and the box mix helped speed things up.  Will definately make again.

I used black beans instead of refried, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Yum!  It was so much easier to eat the tacos this way.  I'm hooked for life!

Just ok.  I liked the idea of it, but the outer tortilla got pretty soggy and it was just all too much.  Would prefer either hard or soft shell by themselves.  Sorry.  Wasn't bad in any way, just not something I'd go to the effort to make again.

This is a great twist on the classic taco.  Enfolding the hard taco shell within the soft tortilla makes eating the taco far more manageable and cleaner.  A keeper!

Delicious recipe and it was fun to make.  I made a vegetarian version of this by using veg. refried beans (spread on the soft tortilla) and black beans I had cooked up with some onion, green pepper, and jalapeno were used as the filling for the crisp taco shells  The tacos stayed together nicely and I just chopped up the veggies and let everybody put whatever combination of lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese and sour cream they enjoy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was very leary to use the guacamole recipe with sour cream so I used the allrecipes "guacamole" recipe by Bob Cody.  I already knew that recipe is a winner & easy.  Since the guacamole already has tomatoes I skipped putting anymore on the taco.  I felt the 2/3 cup water was WAY too much....I'll start with 1/4 cup and slowly add up to a 1/2 cup next time.  My beans were too watery with 2/3 cup.  I might try using spicy refried beans next time and just using all the taco seasoning on the beef.   I had no problem with soggy taco shells & no problem using generic taco shells.  I do recommend white flour tortillas, I tried wheat and it wasn't the same.  This recipe is AMAZING, fun, and loved by all.

We made topping substitutions, but this is now a favorite of ours. The double shell means you get your crunch without the shell falling apart - genius!

Double Decker Tacos were on the menu last evening.........awesome!  Not only were they delicious, they were less messy than just having them in a hard shell.  The only thing I did was to "kick up a notch" the seasoning mix....we like things a bit more spicy.  And as far as reviewer Robert's comments.....this is a food forum.....who is holding a gun to his head to partake of this shared recipe?  Gold stars to the individual sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. The only change that I made was to omit the hard taco shells since hubby has a hard time eating them. So soft tacos it was, and they were really delish, too. Thanks for sharing

No surprise here that these are the BEST tacos ever.  I've been making them this way for years as our family has both hard/soft shell preferences.  When I made my first combo shell taco everyone ooohed & aaahed & now that's all we serve.  

P.S.   ROBERT...you are an  & not welcome on this site.  Nobody wants your negativity.  Go Away or be Nice.

I loved this recipe..i just recently made it two nights ago and it was sooo delicious. my hubby ate two of them and was stuffed and so was i. I left out the refried beans and stuffed it to the very top and even the tortilla it self. it looked like a monster taco instead but was great.

These were delicious!  We eat tacos a lot, so I didn't think you could improve on the old favorites, but this really takes them up a level.  I was afraid my kids wouldn't like the beans/meat, so I had some cooked chicken on hand to make chicken soft tacos..well, they gobbled these up!  They didn't even realize they were eating beans.  I like to add some fresh minced garlic to my guacamole, but other than that the recipe is perfect as is!

This is my favorite way to prepare tacos, I just spread the beans on the tortilla and throw them in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds then wrap wrap it around the hard shell - much easier and less dishes to do.   Fill the taco with whatever the family prefers!!

Enjoyed the crunch of the hard shell inside the soft shell.  It kept all of the crumbles contained.  We will do this again.

This is a great taco recipe.  I would never have thought to adding the soft shell that is spread with refried beans around the hard shell.  This was a huge hit in this home!

I make my own refried BLACK beans using peanut oil, and have my own quacamole recipe plus don't use the taco seasoning because being 100% spaniard we've got our own way of seasonsoning. 
Still for someone who isn't familiar with hispanic cooking this recipe is perfect.

If you're looking for an authentic taco recipe, keep moving. If you're looking for a really tasty meal or if you're like us and don't eat fast food much anymore but sometimes miss the flavors, you can't go wrong with this. We both thought these were great. My only change was to only use 1/3 c of water in the beans because it seemed like enough. Next time I might not add any. Great recipe, thanks!

I have a nursery school class in school and when they got these tacos,  they were ecstatic! They wanted more and these kids are only 4 and 5, but they kept asking for seconds and thirds, but we didn't have any more. THEY ATE IT ALL!! I totally recommend everyone try this recipe!!!

I left out the onion, personal preference.  And, I bought the hard shells in a package that came with sauce & seasoning.  Don't do that!  The shells were too small and the seasoning was way too salty.  Otherwise, this is one of the best recipes I have made from the Allrecipes website, a must try!

This recipe was so disgusting it tasted good. Its like a double negative makes a positive, but the negatives were both in one food. I'm positive there weren't any positives, but it still was positively delicious. Wow

It was a bit labor intensive. When I ate the leftovers, I ate the refried beans on the side and did one hard shell. I also didn't make the guacamole. I cut up avocados and put them on top. Save yourself calories and use plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream!

Whole family loved them!
We are lucky enough to have access to fresh made  tortilla dough, just heat up cast iron skillet and cook fresh tortillas.  We bought corn shells at grocery store
For beans we simply use Ranch style black beans, add a lil seasoning to them and puree them with emersion blender.
We used ground venison (Texas whitetail) cooked with a lil seasoning,  keeps the meat very healthy 
Avocados are perfect this time of year too.
Have cheese, sour cream, cilantro, jalapenos, etc. for toppings
Lil kids can eat them without a huge disaster is best part of double decker tacos

So good!!  Always looked for a solution to hard-to-eat hard taco shells!  The key to this recipe is the refried beans on the soft shell.  Red onion also gives it a kick!  This is how I'm making tacos from now on !

Yum. I really just used this for the idea of baking the hard shells and surrounding with soft shells + refried beans (didn't make the guac and used my standard taco fillings). It's awesome, and way more filling than my usual taco dinner. I don't think I'll ever go back to plain tacos!

I love this!  Fast, easy, tasty!  Husband loves these tacos:-)  I did add cheese to the refried beans which made for more taste by itself.

I also use jalapenos, lemon, onions and fresh tomatoes to make guacamole.  I used to use hamburger but I changed to flank steak.  I chop the flank steak into small cubes and cook it with potatoes, onions and serrano peppers for more heat.  Everything else I do similar although I cook my own corn tortillas.  I don't like to use those excessively crisp store bought taco shells.
