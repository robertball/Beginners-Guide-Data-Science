Quite a nice recipe. This particular mix of flours works perfectly for a true shortbread texture. When mixing this up, the spices seem like they will be overpowering but it is not so. The outcome is a delicately spiced, buttery cookie. Watch the time though, mine were ready in about 20 minutes. A half recipe gave me 16 cookies-each weighing 20 grams before baking. Thank you for the recipe.

I have not tried it, and it sounds tasty, but traditional Scottish shortbread does not have any of the spices this recipe calls for. I understand the change in flours, due to being gluten-free, but with the other additions it is not "traditional."
