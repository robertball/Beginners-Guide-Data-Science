Great salad, easy to make, and it was great both warm and cold. I did add some boneless skinless thighs, it was GREAT! will definitely make again.

The recipe as stated is really good (5 stars for the recipe). It will definitely be a staple in my household as my wife also enjoyed it! I did make a few changes - I cooked the pasta in the broccoli water to get more of a broccoli flavor and added some boneless chicken breast. Lastly, I used pasta shells instead of linguine to give it more volume. Thanks for sharing!

You really don't need to use (and wash) three pots.  When there is about 5 minutes left for the pasta, add the broccoli to the pasta water.  Drain.  Use the same pot to saute the garlic and chili flakes and dump the pasta and broccoli back.  Toss well.   A nice side dish or salad meal all on it's own.

substitutions: 
* Green Giant Steamers - Tuscan season broccoli instead of fresh broccoli 
* butter instead of oil or olive oil

I made the recipe the same with the substituting from above. and it was delicious. took the same amount of time. it did need some salt after but I give it a thumbs up! i differently will make this again.

This is a big hit!  I used Dreamsfield pasta to cut down on carbs and added some salad dressing mix to the oil for added flavor.  Will definitely make again!

This did not work for me..it was just ok! I thought it lacked for flavor and I had to do a lot of doctoring to get it up to par. I've made similar recipes that were so much more flavorful.

I made this for a pot luck and made some substitutions based on what I had on hand. I substituted gluten free pasta because some of the attendees of the event were allergic to gluten. Because of the red pepper flakes, it gave it a bit of a kick that was almost too spicy for some. I didn't like the type of olive oil I had on hand. Overall I'd like to try this recipe again in the future using regular linguine and a better olive oil and maybe fewer red pepper flakes.

Super easy and delish!  Didn't have linguine so used penne. And omitted parsley as I didn't have it on hand.  Leave out the crushed red pepper for kids - daughter ate it up!

I made it...however, it didn't have the flavor I expected and it was a little to oily for me. The red pepper added almost way too much flavor.

Super easy! I used rotini instead of linguini (because that's what I had), and cooked the broccoli with it as another reviewer suggested. I didn't have any parsley so I used a bit of basil and oregano instead. I was tempted to add butter (as I always am), but was able to refrain. I didn't miss it, and the kids loved it!

An easy-to-make alternative to our usual side dishes. We had it with the Unbelievable Chicken from this site and it was delicious. I loved all of the broccoli in it. The pepper flakes gave it a nice flavor with the garlic and cheese. Next time I might add a bit more olive oil.
