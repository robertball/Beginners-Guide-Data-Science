Very nice but I think swiss cheese is not needed as mozzarella more fits the bill.   LOVE the idea that the pasta can be cooked with the onion soup mix  and then the soup mix is drained off as packaged onion soup mix is VERY salty.   Might consider adding a few fresh mushrooms cooked with the zucchini.

I left out the swiss cheese and used all mozzerella because of one of the reviews I read.  Next time I'll use it. It was too stringy, I think the swiss cheese would make a nice balance.

Super Easy. Kids ate it and didn't notice the zucchini!

this was easy and had everything on hand..only thing I changed or added was a small splash of tomato sauce. my son loved it and  & had seconds .. used as a side dish with modest porkchops I used from this sight..
