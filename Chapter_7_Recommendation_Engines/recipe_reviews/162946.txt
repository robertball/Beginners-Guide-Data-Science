I served this at a neighborhood open house after trick-or-treating and everyone loved it!  I even forgot to add the brown sugar but everyone said it was great without.  I used cider fresh from a local apple farm - I'm sure that made a difference. Enjoy!

I don't generally like cider, but was asked to bring some for a party last night.  It was outstanding,  and even I enjoyed it.  The large amount of alcohol worried me that it was going to be too sharp,  but I couldn't taste it at all.  The guests and host loved it,  and it looks like I'll be bringing this every year.  :)

I loved this recipe. I made it for a party and my friends loved it. One thing though, I would cut down on the Rum and only use 1 cup of it instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Then I made it, minus the alcohol, for my son's class (Christmas Party) and it was a huge hit. The kids told me it was the best apple cider that they had ever had and the teacher asked me for the recipe.

Yummm! This got rave reviews at a harvest festival. One guest described it as "boozy apple pie." So delicious! I used fresh-pressed cider and omitted the brown sugar, as I always find good cider to be plenty sweet already.

FANTASTIC!!  I made this for a Moms Night Out bonfire - with a couple modifications - and everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 the brown sugar, 1C. medium rum & 3/4C butterscotch schnapps.  I am not a fan of rum or butterscotch and this was EXCELLENT!  Perfect for a cold evening.  I did cook it as stated on the stove, but transferred to a crockpot for the evening (5 hours).  PERFECT!!  Will defiently make again - good reason for a bonfire!

This was a HUGE hit for me (sorry it took me so long to write a review!). I ended up using a medium rum as opposed to dark which was perfect. I also added the butterscotch schnapps to taste. Make sure all those spices are wrapped tight! Mine got loose but it still was great!

This is so good, one of the best spiked ciders I have ever had!! I added whole peppercorns and a little ginger.

made 2 huge batches of this (34 servings & 23 servings) for a pumpkin carving party. it was a huge hit & did, indeed, make our place smell amazing! in the 34 serving version i followed the instructed alcohol amounts & it was strong. i scaled back the booze in the 23 servings pot for a lightly spirited option. either way, everyone loved it & definitely made us warm & fuzzy. will make a big batch again for a party or tea kettle version for a casual nightcap...thanks danny!    ps: liquor store didnt have butterscotch schnapps so i used butterscotch liqueur. it works well but its sweeter than schnapps, so scale accordingly.

Good for a cold night.  A little strong on the alcohol taste, which some may love; I'd recommend adding less alcohol to start.

Pretty good, but the rum was simply overpowering, would have preferred a little less alcohol and a little more flavor.

This is such a wonderful hot drink, with just enough alcohol to warm you without knocking you over. Delicious.

This cider is incredible. My only mistake was not making enough for a crew of 12! It's also nice because the non-alcoholic version of this recipe is also quite good (for those who do not imbibe). I made ZERO changes and it was perfect. Left it heated on low on the stove throughout the event, which did not seem to cause any problem.

Pretty good. I have been wanting to try EGRIVNER's twisted cider, but because my grocery store didn't have cinnamon schnapps, I defaulted to this recipe instead (the butterscotch schnaps, which I LOVE, intrigued me). While I like this, I too feel that the rum overpowers everything else. I even cut the amount called for by 1/2 cup (I upped the schnapps by 1/2 to compensate). Perhaps spiced rum or a lighter rum would be better???? Regardless, this was good, and is something that I'd make again if I were craving a "grown up" drink. My fiance and I sure enjoyed our cider and s'mores! :-) Thanks for sharing, Keri. Danny sure was right!

This went GREAT! I made this at Thanksgiving in a crockpot. I kind of just felt my way around adding the rum and butterscotch to taste. There were over 20 people at the event and everyone loved it!!! I had so many recipe requests. :) Also someone mentioned that a few orange pieces might taste good in this as well. It is so good and easy to work with. Also, making it in a crockpot, I just waited for it to be warm, then I added the alcohol. Once it's warm, you can keep it on low and kind of have the aroma around and have some throughout the evening. Everyone loved it! It was perfect.

This is a fabulous punch, perfect to put in to-go mugs while trick-or-treating with the kids on Halloween night! I leave out the brown sugar, as it's plenty sweet and always add a little more Butterscotch Schnapps and a little less Captain Morgan. I use a coffee filter with a rubber band for the spices when I don't have cheesecloth on hand. Just put this in the crockpot after simmering on the stove and you are good all night! Delicious fall drink!

Made it as stated with the exception of using spiced rum as opposed to dark rum.  I was a little skeptical of the butterscotch schnapps, but it definitely adds a smooth, buttery finish to the drink. Everyone at the party absolutely loved it, even those who "don't do frilly alcohol" and a doubled recipe was gone in no time.  I, too, did the initial cooking on the stovetop then transferred to a crockpot for the party and it was perfectly fine.

I combined this with my mom's recipe.  It was delicious.  I used 14 cups of cider, I doubled the allspice and cloves and added a tablespoon of butter.  I used 3 cups of Bacardi White rum and 1 cup of butterscotch schnapps.  I threw everything in the crock pot.  Like many other reviewers I omitted the sugar.  It does have a liquor taste...but I think it should!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was ok. Some folks thought it was a bit too sweet.
