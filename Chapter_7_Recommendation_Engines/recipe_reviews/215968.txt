Great recipe!  I had to make it a little bit different as I did not have the peas.  I added frozed beans in with the pasta (during boiling) and I did not have garlic powder so I used dried minced garlic.  I also added some diced orange and red peppers that I had in the freezer.  One of the best recipes I have tried from allrecipes!

So good! Used Rebecca Swift's recipe for Alfredo Sauce from this website. Even my toddler liked it and she doesn't eat anything!

This pasta was very good! Easy and quick to make which is what I was going for tonight. This is also very inepensive to make, so if you're wanting a budget-friendly meal this would be a great choice. Having the peas mixed into the pasta makes it easy to get an added vegetable serving into kids who usually avoid veggies. The spices added a great Italian flavor to the pasta, and it turned out very tasty. I will make this recipe again when I need something quick. Thanks for the recipe, Ruth!

I have to add more alfredo sauce otherwise the pasta soaks it all up.
