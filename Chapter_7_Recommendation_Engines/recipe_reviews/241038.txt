This cake helped me out of a dire situation today. I was DESPERATE for chocolate cake, but as I'm the only chocolate lover in the family I needed something small. Not that I'm incapable of  eating an entire two layer fudge bomb, but I was afraid I'd get caught in the act and would have to live with the shame. 
This was just what I was looking for...fudgy goodness in a sane quantity.
 I made it in a smallish bowl instead of a mug and was glad I did. If you have a large  jumbo mug it should work, but it would have spilled over any of my regular ones. I added a bit of cinnamon and a handful of chocolate chips, microwaving it for about 2 minutes and 15 seconds, opening the door and checking a few times during the last 45 seconds or so. Even with all that checking it still turned out perfectly!

I wish that the recipe said to use an over sized mug, a small casserole dish, or big soup bowl because I followed the directions and mine spilled all over the inside of the microwave.  Ate very little of it because that was all that was left.  And I did follow the directions about how long to cook it.

Tastes great but way too much fat and sugar! There are 4 tablespoons of sugar in this so that's almost 200 calories right there and 48 grams of sugar. That's crazy. My advice is cut the sugar way down to 2 tablespoons  or even 1 tablespoon. 2 tablespoons will have you at 90 calories and 24 grams of sugar. I suggest doing 1 tablespoon and removing the oil with applesauce. It takes good, is still moist but so much healthier. My changes are 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons applesauce, 3 tablespoons Blue Diamond Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk makes it only 202 calories and only 12 grams of sugar.

I just made this and I want more! I NEVER review anything no matter how good it is. But for this mommy whose baby is teething and need something RIGHT NOW to shut down the craving monster this is heaven. It's so creamy and fluffy. I followed everything except the time on the microwave. Since I added a big spoon of Nutella in the middle and semi sweet chocolate chips I put it for 2 min and 20 sec and it came out perfect. I listened to other reviewers and did mine in a soup mug and it was perfect. I can see why it would go over in a regular mug.   Trust me make this cake! It will make your day. It definitely just made mine. Thank you for the recipe it's a keeper

I used the applesauce and additional water instead of the oil and substituted Stevia for baking for the sugar. Also I sprinkled a few peanut butter chips on top before putting it in the microwave. Delicious!

I made exactly as written and added chocolate chips. Super light and fluffy, much better texture than the recipes that use an egg. Will definitely make this one again. I did use an oversized mug and it fit perfectly, regular mug would be too small.

As far as mug cakes go...This one is FANTASTIC!  I love that is doesn't call for eggs, and if you cook it a bit less it has a lovely molten effect.  I cooked mine in a cereal bowl rather than a mug and it worked great!   My kids each made one as well and all managed to make a successful treat (ages 7,10,13)  So very friendly recipe.   Everybody did their own add in's including coconut, nuts, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and chocolate chips...pretty much whatever we did to this cake, it thrived lol

After making the first time I have tripled the recipe. Keep it in the refrigerator and pour enough into a cup for anytime I would like the treat. This recipe is perfect.  Add anything I'd like. A little bit of peanut butter, Nutella, chocolate chips or soft ice cream on top. And always whipped cream. It really is perfect.

A sad way to ruin your microwave. I mixed this recipe up looking for an flavor escape on an otherwise boring night. When the microwave timer went off, I was disappointed at the sight of a soupy disaster pooling around the coffee mug in the machine. Like a record player ruined by a sick DJ, my microwave is now a rotating disk of sadness and broken dreams.

This is my go to solo dessert except I half the whole thing. Full recipe is actually pretty big and sort of depressing when you scoop a quarter cup of sugar into a bowl and eat it all. 

1/4 cup = 4 tbs so its pretty eat to split. Plus, I never have milk so I swap that for water and it always comes out delicious. If halving it, it only needs 1 minute in the microwave instead of what the recipe says. Happy desserting!

So good, and so easy to make, if you're like me, you'll want to make it TWICE and eat both mugs one right after the other. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 1/4 cup) and cooked it 90 seconds in my 1200W microwave. Next time, I'll try 75 seconds, as I like it a bit more gooey. But oh, SO good. Definitely a keeper.

Made it 3 times, first time it over-flowed. Sadly, the cake didn't rise, and looked utterly disgusting. But, I digress, because something ugly doesn't mean its tasty! However, that was wrong. Tried it, and it didn't taste like sweet, delicious chocolate, but rather sour coco without any sugar, and even that was hard to taste. It was also almost impossible to clean the mugs after, where even just a little bit of soap and water couldn't fix it, but rather had to scrub it until it was clean, and run it through the dish washer. Definitely will try and find a new recipe, and do not recommend this to anyone who wants to clean mugs that will take 30 minutes each.

Turned out way better than I thought it would. It was delicious and fluffy and was perfect for sharing with my brother, but it could be polished on its own. I did, however, microwave it for 30 seconds longer, just because it still felt a little dense after the two minutes. But it was delicious and I am forever awaiting the day that I can make it again.......which is probably soon.

Made it EXACTLY as written.  It was terrific.  Great for when the grandkids come over and you need a fast project for them as well as a dessert.  They loved the idea of making their own dessert in such a short time.  Used a 12 oz. disposable coffee cup, no clean up!!!!

Resembles the consistency of chocolate cake/brownie, but does taste like chocolate. I added chocolate sauce, hot chocolate fudge and chopped up candy bars and still couldn't match the chocolate taste of real chocolate cake.

This was one of the better mug cakes I've had. Great little treat  especially with some cream. I added a little extra milk and substituted canola for olive oil, as well as putting it in the microwave for about 1min 30. Was a big hit among  my housemates, will make again.

Probably the best cake I've ever eaten. I did not have canola oil so I used 1.5 tbsp unrefined coconut oil (still tastes like coconut) and a dash of olive oil (maybe 1 tsp).  I microwaved it for 1:30 and I used a  medium sized glass mixing bowl (not a cup). 

I also made Alton Brown's whipped cream recipe to go on top. Placed the metal bowl and whisk in the freezer for 10 minutes before adding the ingredients. It was 1/2 cup whipping cream/heavy cream 1 tbsp sugar.

the video says 2 T. milk but the recipe says 3 T. You should make them match.   I made mine with 2 T. milk, 1 1/2 T. each oil and water.  It turned out fine.  Delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I adapted based on what I had on hand and suggestions from other reviewers. I used the 1 1/2 tbsp of applesauce, 3 tbsp suger, 3 tbsp cocoa powder, 3 tbsp half and half. I didn't have any milk and since I was using half and half I really didn't want to use oil. I also threw in a small handful of chocolate chips and cooked it for 90 seconds, threw a few mini marshmallows on top and cooked for an additional 10 seconds. I used a cereal bowl to avoid overflow. It wad pretty good,  I would definitely make this again. Nice to know my chocolate craving can be easily satisfied. It was enough to share with my hubby.

Perfect for the person that it's not safe to leave a full size cake in the house.  It's just the right amount and it has a good texture.

This recipe rocks!! I am the only one who likes chocolate cake for dessert now and again,but I'm not going to make or buy an entire cake for one or two pieces. Problem solved with this! I followed the recipe to the letter except for the addition of some chopped walnuts.  Will definitely make again!

Quick, easy, and delicious! Goes well with a fallow of whipped cream. We're glad we used large mugs. We found that it made large cakes and we couldn't eat them all. We'll be making half batches in the future. This is a keeper!

Holy  y'all!!! This recipe is naughty. I never should have made it. The peanut gallery and I wanted a sweet treat, and not wanting to bake a whole cake, because I'm likely to eat half of it myself, I thought we would give these a try. The kids each made their own with a little help getting measurements right. We followed directions exactly and they came out perfectly! Chocolatey, rich, and fluffy. We got crazy and topped each with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go do like 600 sit-ups so I can work off tomorrow's mug cake. ??

I will make this again ~ it's a great "Emergency Chocolate Fix" :)

Of course I tinkered with this. I tripled the recipe, added one egg plus a biiiiiiiig hand-full of chocolate chips which sank to the bottom and made lovely gooey spots in the bottom of cake. I nuked it in a medium-sized casserole dish and watched like a hawk as it baked and rose above but not over the bowl. *whew* It took about 4 minutes on High in my powerful micro. There was plenty of cake to eat ~ enough for 4 slices. 

Thoughts for next time: Add a Nutella "bomb" in the middle before baking. Also, wondering if I sprayed the bowl with pan release if I could pop that cake out onto a serving dish... 

Have fun & Eat Your Chocolate!

I just added a little more milk than it called for, and added a very small amount of sugar and it was just perfect! It is a little rich, but not as rich as some other microwave cakes I have had. I will definitely make this again!

It's not every day I buy a mug for One recipe, but today was that day!  Wonderful, simple mug cake that will be a weekly treat (pending my weight gain) and my husband loves it.  A man not easily impressed.  Thanks!

Tried this tonight to quench a late night chocolate cake craving. Did not have oil, so used sour cream instead. Otherwise made as directed and it turned out so yummy! Not rubbery or dry at all. Threw in a few milk chocolate chips also. My son shared it with me and loves it too. Definitely adding to our favorites.

The only difference between your recipe and mine is that I don't eat dairy due to casein intolerance - so I used plain, unsweetened almond milk.

Somehow, it turned out apocalyptic.

Maybe it's because I'm at sea level. Maybe it's because of the barometric pressure being highly unstable in my city. Maybe it's just an ancient god of baking looking down upon me. But it never rose properly. Despite following the recipe to the letter, the second I took it out, it deflated and began to sizzle. 

My brother walked in and asked what I set on fire. Nothing - though I then set the smoke alarm off by walking to put it to cool and maybe salvage it with some dairy-free chocolate chips. Everything I used was fresh and measured well. My mug was made for cakes, soups, and soufflés. There should have been zero problem.

But no, it's a congealed, burnt mess that is weirdly rising AFTER the fact. My baking soda is just a normal store brand we've used for years. No fancy stuff. So it's not that.

My microwave is a normal Sylvania model that has adjustable power. I did it at 1200W, and then tried a new cake at 1000W just to be safe.

It exploded. It freakin' exploded.

I cannot endorse a recipe that causes my microwave to get burnt cocoa stuck in its vents forever. Sorry.

Oh my goodness that was AMAZING!!! Its almost  dangerous to have the batter in your fridge. Defiantly split this between two or three people. It is very rich. All In All, I have never had a cake so good in such a short time. I do recommend microwaving it for one minute and then adding chocolate chips, and then doing another ten seconds. Enjoy eating this Delicious dessert!

It was perfect! If you want to be extra indulgent, mix in a few semi-sweet chocolate chips before microwaving. Also, sprinkle some powdered sugar on top after it’s done. Yummy!

I think this might be the first time I've ever reviewed something, and it's because I have never made anything as many times as I've made this. It really is perfect. I make it exactly as written. I was trying to be good for my husband while he was dieting but had the worst sweet tooth ever - this saved me :) And since then I've made it for my boys when they beg for dessert, they love it too! My microwave is higher wattage and I like it slightly gooey so 1:20 is how long mine needs. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've tried other mug cakes before and they've been awful so I was hesitant to try this one, however this mug cake did not disappoint! It is a lot of cake so I would recommend cutting it in half if you aren't super hungry, but if your're PMSing this is the magic recipe! I added extra salt because I like sweet and salty (probably added closer to 1/4 tsp) and it is so good! If you make the full recipe def use a bigger mug!

I made this cake one late night. Super easy and so moist and delicious. No adjustments to the recipe were needed. It came out perfectly as directed. I’ve sent the recipe to my chocolate loving family members. As others have noted, make sure to use a large mug. I’ll make it again probably more than once this week. It’s that tasty.

I seem to be in the minority. I didn’t like this at all. It was light and fluffy but really bitter. The only substitution I made was 1/4 cup Stevia in the Raw instead of regular white sugar.

Made it a 2nd time and doubled the Stevia in the Raw and added pecans. Still a bitter aftertaste but not as bad but really dry. I’ll give this one more try with apple sauce or chocolate chips for more moisture.

Followed the recipe , although didn’t have vanilla extract, so left it out. Doubled the recipe, and split with my son. After reading many reviews, I put half in two bowls. I had peanut butter chips and my son had plain chocolate chips. We cooked them for 1 min. This is the first review I have ever written on here, and it is totally worth it.  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME

A great, easy and straight forward recipe when in a pinch or when a quick treat is needed. I opted for the healthier apple sauce option as I usually do. It came out great.

Delicious! I eat dairy free, so I subbed almond milk for cow's milk and used a dairy-free butter in place of the oil. I also added about 1 tablespoon of dairy free chocolate chips and microwaved for 1 minute, 15 seconds which made for a gooey and delicious treat. I followed others' suggestions and used a bowl in lieu of a mug and it filled the bowl.

Not a good recipe. I followed it down to the letter, and when it was done after 2 minutes in the microwave, the top of the cake wasn’t baked. I continued to cook it for small intervals at a time and when I finally gave up, not only was the top still not done, the bottom had  cemented itself into the bottom of the mug! Not satisfied at all.

It turned out terrible the cake looked nice but when I tasted it, it tasted too sweet and was too gross to even eat. In my opinion, it had too much cocoa powder. I couldn't eat the cake it was just too much sweetness, and a complete and utter fail and disgrace to the cake family. It was a waste of time and sugar! so I made it again and add 3 eggs, 1/2 tablespoon of cocoa powder and 8 strawberries cut up. now, this is what I'm talking about! this was moist, decedent and the best chocolate cake ever, i highly recommend my version! :) HAPPY BAKING!!!!!!!

Awful. I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in the microwavefor a minute and forty five seconds, and it was EXTREMELY undercooked. I had to cook it for a minute longer to make it even remotely edible. It was also far too sweet.

So. Good. Thanks, after trying a different recipe (and failing miserably), I decided to try this, and it’s delicious. Just make sure you mix it up really, really well:)

I followed the directions perfectly, yet I still had issues. The cake burnt even when I put it in for LESS then it said! After eating just a BITE of this cake I am now having stomach issues and severe headaches even though I am not allergic or having anything against these ingredients. I spent my whole morning make these and it took forever. (Not her fault ovbiously) But it was just a waste of time for this awful cake(s). Overall disappointed.

Shame on you. This is way too naughty. Freaking delicious. I loved every bite! I fixed mine in one of those soup mug bowls for 1 min 45 in a 1100 watt MW oven. It tested done; then when I inverted it onto my dish, there was some slightly undercooked batter.  Note to self -- cook another 15 seconds and check midway.  My only edit was using Avocado Oil and not canola oil.  I just don't ever use that stuff. Avocado and chocolate go together well, so I thought why not!  and it was perfect.  Coconut oil would also work well. MMMmm.  This makes a humongous serving.  Perfect to share with someone!!

I made it and it overflowed my cup. Definitely need to use an oversized mug or something larger than a regular mug. I should have read the reviews first, as others have commented the same.

This was an amazeballs cake.  Much better than the other mug cake we tried that had an egg - the consistency was more cake like.  If you try this make sure you use an oversized mug - it overflows a regular sized mug.  Put a plate under whatever ug you use to catch any overflow.  It fluffy, wam, chocolatey, delicious, and super easy to make.

Great recipe! One Critique i would add is to add an egg to your mixture. If you are making it in a  bowl and transferring it to a cup, than it makes this easier to do, and makes the consistency a more light and fluffy mixture. In my experience, it changes nothing, other than the texture and aeration.

This was so unbelievably easy! The texture was light and fluffy and warm, it was a beautiful thing! I added a 1/2 tbs more of cocoa powder and chocolate chips after it cooked in the microwave and it made it a little more rich. SO GOOD!

THIS TASTES LIKE A REAL CAKE!!!! I have tried other recipes and it tastes too much like flour. I had to cook mine for about 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Note: if you add chocolate chips on top it is AWESOME!!!!

BEST MUG CAKE RECIPE. I love that it doesn't require any eggs. Normal mug cakes always turn out too eggy tasting to me, and this eliminates that problem. I added a handful of chocolate chips, as per another reviewer's suggestions. I also used a tall mug cause mug cakes tend to rise a lot when they cook.  I also only microwaved it for about 1 minute 30 seconds. Dangerously delicious!

I made this in a bowl so it wouldn't spill over, and so I could put a scoop of ice cream right on the top. It was heavenly. I'll definitely make this again in the cover of night so no one can judge me.

This was a fluffy, moist, chocolatey cake in just minutes. My 4 year-old helped make and eat it. So good warm. It's so fluffy it falls apart, but eating it straight from the mug helps that.  I used a 12 oz coffee mug--it came a little over the top while cooking but did not spill over.

First ever mug cake I've made and it far exceeded my expectations. I added a couple of those caramel filled wedge shaped chocolates from Trader Joe's but honestly it's yummy enough it doesn't need anything! Followed the rec. as stated exactly, nuked it 1 min 45 sec in my 1100 watt microwave. I will definitely be making this again.

Since I've found this recipe,  I've made this mug cake at least a dozen times.  It never fails.   I prefer my chocolate chips on the top, after the cake comes out of the microwave.  It almost makes a melted frosting.   Also, I make it in a large cereal/soup bowl.

Well the cake it's self taste amazing however I would prefer if there was less oil and an egg. Also the amount of time it must be in the microwave is inaccurate. Besides that it's a great recipe.

This tasted great, especially with a little vanilla bean ice cream and some chocolate syrup on top! I'd definitely use a bowl for this one, though. I saw someone else suggested this, and I'm glad I did. It took up an entire cereal bowl! Fantastic Recipe, though, definitely a keeper!

Good texture and chocolatey. My only issue is that the minute + 45 seconds was probably too long as the the cake tasted dry. Next time, I'll cut it down to 90 seconds (and maybe split it with my husband).

I tried to make this but it it ended up spilling over the cup and all over the microwave. After cleaning it up and multiple tries it just would not bake so I didn't get to eat it. I'm disappointed as I was looking forward to eating some chocolate cake.

Whoa! This was deliciously CHOCOLATEY. VERY moist and decadent. I used almond milk with a hint of honey and it sprinkled milk chocolate chips on top. I can't wait to make it AGAIN.

A really quick and easy dessert if you're really craving one. I added one more tablespoon of cocoa powder, one tablespoon less sugar, and some chocolate chips to mine. It was dense, not too sweet, and satisfying. :)

This cake did what they said it would. But if I make it again I will cut down on the sugar, it's way to sweet!

I added 60% cacao chips to the batter and topped the cake with mini marshmallows after taking it from the microwave. The gooey hot marshmallows add an extra dimension to a good microwave cake recipe.

This was very good!  I added peppermint extract to the mix and drizzled it with chocolate syrup while it was hot.  So yummy!

It definitely made a chocolate mug cake, but the taste was sort of off. It left a strange smell in my kitchen afterwards.

Yum yum yum! Pro tip from someone who makes this way too often: DONT PUT THE FLOUR IN FIRST, it leaves some at the bottom. Or maybe I’m just a bad stirrer.

We ate it as is and thought it tasted like super chocolatey fudge cake deliciousness! I made it with the ingredients exactly as per the VIDEO. The video only used 2 TBSP OF MILK, NOT 3, as written. However, I don’t own humongous mugs so I used 3 cup microwaveable (Pyrex) bowls and only cooked them for 90 seconds. I cooked one at a time and they were perfect! Now that I’ve done that this recipe is a keeper. I will certainly try it with frosting or ganache, chocolate chips or whatever add-ins desired as the cake will definitely support them and I know they will taste awesome! Ooh,

Came out great! Had to adjust the recipe only because I’m high altitude but the recipe is great. Super simple. 1 min and 45 sec was a tad bit too long, so maybe only let it go to 1 min and 35 instead but other than that, PERFECT

I didn't make any changes, and it tasted amazing but I think the main reason why people are complaining is that they are getting the measurements wrong with the ingredients, because it's hard to find 1/8 of a teaspoon measuring cup, and to the crazy calorie person, don't make the cake if you are just going to change the whole thing.

I made this for my daughter and her friends while we were hosting a sleepover! I used hot coco mix, for I don’t have cocoa powder. It turned out amazing! I topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and sprinkles! (It was for a group of 6, 7 year old girls)

I followed the recipe as written except for the oil. Why ruin a dessert with oil? I used butter.  One minute in the microwave left me with a fudgy, moist, quickie dessert.  Love it!

It is delicious and has amazing flavor. Because it is a little dry, I would rate this a 4/5, but overall is a great option to make.

so good! i recommend putting nutella on top as ‘icing’ and only cooking in the microwave for 1:30 tops. I’ve tried this with vegetable oil and again with olive oil and I’ve determined that you definitely can use any oil you want for this. 10/10 recommend!

I make this recipe all the time when I'm craving chocolate but don't have any in the house! It makes quite a bit, so sometimes I'll eat half and save the other half for later. Like most mug cakes, it's a little dry on its own, so I prefer to eat it with ice cream and/or chocolate chips!

I really liked this mug cake! The recipe is kind of big for a smaller mug but I used a bigger one and everything fit perfectly! This mug cake is really good for me because it doesn't have an overpowering sweetness too it. I am teenager and it was really simple, quick and easy even for me! I really recommend it! I ended up only having to cook mine for 1 minute and 45 seconds and topped it with some chocolate chips!

I did use half the sugar as others suggested - it was still good, but I'm sure it would be delicious with the full amount. Otherwise, no changes. I also split it into two mugs and thought that this was a nice serving size without being too huge (70 seconds to cook a smaller amount.) Would be nice with ice cream or whipped cream.

Loved it - it was extremely easy to make.  Definitely use a cereal bowl or something similar in size.  I used reviewers suggestion on this and glad I did.  Easy and quick.  Was done right as I finished putting away the ingredients :)

This is a good and quick recipe for chocolate cake when you have the late night sweet tooth. I read a few reviews of the folks who experienced the overflow problem. So instead of baking in a mug, I used a small casserole dish.  The cake turned out to be nice and fluffy. It satisfied the sweet tooth without being overly sweet and fattening. I will make it again but will cut the recipe in half. I felt it was too much for one serving.

i love it so so much! i put it in the microwave for 1 min 50 sec and it looks perfect. i would use less sugar next time, it's way too sweet. 
also a tip for EVERY recipe, do NOT overdo it with the baking soda! i've messed up recipes before due to overusing baking soda, it makes it very bitter.

I like using this recipe when I’m craving for something with chocolate. I usually like to add chocolate chips or chocolate syrup to get the double chocolate feeling. Whenever taking it out of the microwave, you usually have to get hot pads otherwise it might burn you. Great Recipe!

It is very easy and quick to make with ingredients you're likely to have in the house already.  I was surprised at how good and tasty it turned out - great texture and taste without compromise.

NB: I accidentally halved all the tablespoon quantities on my first try - only the tablespoon quantities. The cake turned out amazing. Then I made it again with the full tablespoon quantities as per the recipe but the one with the accidental half tablespoon quantities turned out much nicer. Lighter, better flavor and better texture.  So I'll recommend following this recipe but halving all the tablespoon quantity ingredients.

Made just as directed and it turned out perfectly. Not too sweet, not toooo chocolatey. Wonderful base recipe for a fast chocolate cake that's also easy to add other ingredients to for something fancier. Only thing missing is a warning about how much it expands during cooking. I figured it wouldn't fit in a mug looking at the proportions and I was right.

Here's my suggestion: either make this in a soup bowl, oversized mug, or split the batter between two regular sized mugs. If you don't, it's going to overflow the mug.

This is the first recipe I've ever commented on because it is honestly life-changing. Simple. Gooey. And a nice portion size. I cut back on the refined sugar and replaced it with a bit of maple syrup. I also used 1/2 cocoa powder, 1/2 of a maca cocoa blend I had lying around.

Wow! so fluffy! I was skeptical because it doesn't have an egg and when I finished mixing the batter it was really thin. but good grief, this hit the spot. I didn't have oil so I melted 2 tbsp butter. and I love chocolate but I reduced the chocolate to 1 tbsp. it just seemed like too much, but it wasn't and I will put 2 next time. long story short if you're thinking of changing the recipe, don't bother. its perfect.

Loved it. Super easy and perfect for a quick chocolate fix. Not the "best cake I've ever eaten" but perfect for a microwave dessert. Definitely use an oversized mug. Its enough to share. I also cut the sugar down to 2 tbsp. I added coconut flakes, pecans and chocolate morsels for extra. .

I’m 9 months pregnant and LIVE for mug cakes! I used applesauce and cut the sugar back to 1 tablespoon. That alone cut way down on the calories/sugar. I’ll also add that for the first time in a long time I’ve run out of vanilla extract so I made it without and it was still great! Definitely making this one again.

Making this is the WORST decision I have ever made.  Its too easy to eat a friggin cake now.  I tried the healthier recipes and the 1:1 ratio of milk and water works well  as well as the applesauce instead of oil.  Cutting the sugar really makes it bland through.  For God's sake you are eating a cake.  If I wanted less sugar I'll stick with an apple. And yes, use a bigger mug.  Thank you Louder with Crowder.  Your mug is made for this sinful decadence.

It is really wonderful! Just the right amount of chocolate. Use a big mug and watch the cooking times, I had to pause the microwave twice to keep an overflow from happening. Also works doubled!

I made this twice, once as is (super yummy!) and again with some tweaks(super yummy & a bit healthier!) I cut the white flour to 2 tbsp and added 2 tbsp oat flour. I eliminated the white sugar and used a tbsp of maple syrup. I used Hershey's super dark cocoa. I lowered the milk (1%) to 2 tbsp and used 2 tbsp babyfood prune puree (very sweet) instead of oil.  The soda. salt and vanilla stayed the same. It was definitely not as sweet, but I am used to making less sweet baked goods, so it was fine with me. The original recipe was great, but I wanted something a bit healthier to give my grands and this is it!

The only thing that I didn't like about it was that when you take it out of the microwave it is to hot to the touch and to eat
But it tastes awesome and I encourage this to all of you chocolate lovers to make it

This is the only mug chocolate cake recipe that wasn’t a disaster and tastes good. Actually, I love it. Since this recipe doesn’t have any eggs in it, you can probably cook it all the way or leave it gooey in some parts. I did the latter and it is delicious!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!! Super fast to make, tastes as good as cake made in the oven. The best part is that it's made, baked, and eaten out of one mug! No mixer required!

If you use a high quality cocoa like Rodelle you may want to cut the cocoa in half. But this is super nice and not eggy, like those that try to include an egg.

This is an amazing recipe!! It is super easy and quick! I doctor mine a little by adding extra cocoa powder and chocolate chips to make it extra chocolate rich!! Whenever I crave chocolate or sweet I make this! I've sent it to everyone I know I love it and swear by it!!

Actually tastes like cake! This is the best mug cake recipe I’ve tried. The texture is really nice! I didn’t have cocoa but I made a version with a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead. Delicious! I think the general cake base could probably work with any flavour.

I made very few changes. I added chocolate chips, reduced the sugar to 3 Tablespoons (I may reduce it further), and I only cooked it for 1 min 30 sec. It came out a bit dry so I will reduce the cook time even further and it should be even better. I added more chocolate chips to help make up for the dryness. My microwave was probably too powerful for the cook time.
I also used an over sized mug and it filled it up!

Really amazing for less than 5 mins total prep and cook time. Moist cake. I shaved chocolate into the batter and the cake absorbed it and became deliciously dark. I also successfully switched out the oil and water for an egg, keeping the milk (although I really don't think the baking soda was necessary afterwards as the whole thing  rose so much!) Also! Be sure to follow the order when adding ingredients. It'll go gross and oily otherwise! I made that mistake the second time around using the oil and water.

Decadent and delicious! Wow was this chocolatey and rich! I made it exactly as described and topped with chocolate chips as recommended. Obviously this isn’t a healthy cake (and you can make substitutions to make it better for you), but I wasn’t after health food when looking for a cake recipe. This is perfect for an occasional treat. I will be making it again. So impressed!! Thank you

I used a 1200 watt microwave and reduced the time to 1 min 15 seconds. Perfect timing! Love the texture and just how simple it is to make. Definitely sharing recipe with family and friends!

This is hilarious simple, love it. I had a date, asedk her if she wanted some ice cream. She said be nice with some chocolate cake. Said didn’t have any but can whip some up. She said, won’t that take a while, told her, no, about 10 min.
She said.....no way.
When returned with the cake, blew her mind......lol. Love this recipe.

Excellent mug cake. One piece of advice I would give is don’t automatically stick to 1:45 cooking time. I found it to be very dry when I cooked for 1:45 so I dropped it to 1:30 and it was moist and amazing. So you may need to adjust the time down or up depending on your microwave.

I followed the directions and  it worked out well enough, but the amount of sugar and oil in it is way too high.  The basic recipe is a good one I think, and next time I do it I will try substituting Stevia and applesauce for sugar and oil.  I know my young grandchildren will enjoy making this, and reducing the sugar and oil will make me feel okay about giving it to them.

Great little snack, although maybe I shouldn’t say little.  It’s substantial.  I could have probably cut ingredients in half.  I did cut sugar in half & it was still delicious.  I’ve made both ways with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/8 cup sugar and I think it’s delicious either way!

Followed the recipe to the letter the first time. Wonderful!! Second time, added orange bakery emulsion (instead of vanilla) and some dark chocolate chips... superb. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you to the author who posted.

I really enjoyed this cake. It came out very porous but fluffy. I felt like mixed it a bit too much, but I liked it! The only "change" I made was using vegetable instead of canola oil. Definitely had to make it in a bowl after reading the reviews, though - the ingredient amounts are too much for a normal sized mug. And since it was too large for one sitting, I placed the rest in the fridge and it held up nicely for two days.

Phenomenal! So fast and easy! I made sure to put my ingredients in a bowl after reading all the other reviews and I'm glad I did. 
It's a shame that people are giving this recipe bad reviews just because of the fact that the ingredients don't work well in a regular mug. 
It still tastes wonderful. ??

delicious! Super easy to make and wonderful flavor. One thing I would recommend is using a huge mug or a bowl. I used a ~14oz mug, but in the past my smaller mugs have spilled over.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I would make sure to use a jumbo mug and keep and eye on  it in the microwave. I add a pinch on powdered sugar on the top after it comes out of the microwave and its fantastic!

I did use baking soda as per recipe and it came out well.   It was good! I used a bigger mug and threw in a handful of tiny chocolate morsels. Very satisfying!

Use a really big mug or you will have a mess!  Two people can share this recipe for a small serving each or eat it all by yourself!  I added a few chocolate chips before cooking and then whipped cream on top.  Perfect empty nester dessert!

It is much quicker, easier (and less dishes) when you use a kitchen scale! You can find a good one for $15! 
Flour 32 g
Sugar 50 g
Cocoa powder 14 g
4 tbsp half and half (replaced water) 60g
Butter 28 g

 I replaced the oil with real butter, I didnt have regular sugar so I used 50 g of brown sugar. This recipe is def not healthy but it isnt supposed to be!! I also used half and half cream instead of milk and replaced 1 tbsp of water with half and half. Also reduced cooking time from 1min45secs to 1min30secs. It tasted very delicious, like the sugar and butter caramelized. Very yummy. I didnt have chocolate chips but that was ok. This was delicious in and of itself. A big glass of milk finishes it off. I dont always like using egg in cake in a mug because it leaves a strong eggy taste. However egg works well to hold it together. There were no issues of it not holding together. Next time I may add 2 tsp of gelatin to see how that works. Have used gelatin in previous recipe and just makes it taste super fudgy. Mmmmm.

Overall pretty good except, mine burnt when I microwaved it. So I added water to the cake and it helped. Next time I will microwave it for 1 min to 1 min 15 sec.

solid recipe for when you need a chocolate fix. 4 stars only because its just a touch off, not sure why... still good though. I put nutella on top

had to microwave 3 min, but that's just because our microwave is weak. 

used a bowl instead of a mug(it would be waaaaay too much in a mug.)

Cake turned out perfect however I preferred a little less sweet so next time I'll use less sugar. 
Added chocolate chips in the recipe. 
Keynote: don't use granulated sugar, I used this and it was a big mistake. You can feel the granules. 
Next time, I'll powder the sugar and then mix it in.

Perfect recipe to satisfy your midnight chocolate cravings. I recommend eating it as soon as it gets out of the microwave, piping hot with some nice whipped cream on top to melt into the chocolate delicousness.

Definitely use a very large mug or small bowl. This really makes enough for two people. I didn't want to share, so I ate it all myself. I added dark chocolate chunks. Next time, I will add a little caramel drizzle and sea salt. i just lost 18lbs, so I have been careful about what I eat. I made sure I ate this VERY carefully lol.

My husband is a diabetic so I really needed something to fix for just me. First time I made it I did not read any of the reviews and used a regular coffee mug and had a little bit of a mess as it boiled over the sides. It still tasted pretty good with some fudge frosting on it while it was still hot. The next time I used a soup mug and cut the sugar by 1 Tblsp. and it was much better. Next time I will add some chocolate chips to the mix and use the full amount of sugar. It has really helped my sweet cravings without making a whole cake.

I used Olive Oil instead of Canola Oil, since I had none. Added about 1 1/2 tbsp chocolate chips, and another 1/4 tsp if vanilla extract. It was a bit on the dry side, but really tasty!

It was super good, but it was way to much for me to eat, and not very healthy. So I split everything in half and it was perfect .i definitely recommend splitting it in half. And maybe reduce the amount of sugar even when you split it in half.

Oh my goodness this is delicious. I followed it to a T! Used a xl size mug. With a 1/4 cup of sugar it's pretty dangerous too but oh so delicious!! My hubby and I shared one of these with a bowl of vanilla icecream. I think my cravings are cured for a month. Loved it!!! Made an account just to leave this review, it was that good. Warm gooey creamy chocolate cake with cold vanilla icecream!! Yum yum yum. Not sure if it was a good idea or bad idea that I made it because this one needs to be eaten in moderation.

It wasn't bad. The taste was fine but the texture came out slightly gelatiny. I used nesquik powder since I don't have cocoa. I would try again when I have better ingredients in the fridge and pantry :)

I just have the worst time with my microwave. It doesn't state the watts on it, so I never know what the correct timing is for microwave recipes and usually have to wing it. I know it runs hot though, so when I made this recipe, I adjusted down, cooking it on high for 1 minute 30 seconds and it came out PERFECT. Nice and moist and NOT rubbery. I wanted something sweet, had nothing else, had the makings for this and I'm so grateful. Thank you! Oh, sorry, no photo cuz I snarfed it up so quick, LOL!

What a treat! I can only give this four stars since I had to change a couple of ingredients. I used grapeseed oil vs canola, and coconut milk vs whole milk. I also threw in some chocolate chips. I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly pleased! Yummy!!

Excellent and super easy! I read reviews before making it and decided to split the batter into ramekins.  We made double the recipe and ended up with 4 ramekins of cake, which we scooped vanilla ice cream on top of. I used coconut oil instead of canola and almond milk instead of dairy and added a few chocolate chips in each dish. Super moist, super easy, and my family loved it!

I always make this, I have made it about 10 times now, it is my favorite recipe. Whenever I am craving chocolate cake, I always make this, because it is so chocolatey and not too rich. I always add lots of chocolate chips and that makes it better. This is the best recipe because it always has the most squishy, moist, spongy cake.  With other mug cake experiences, some times they were soupey and spilled out on to my microwave, but that never happens with this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. Added in a little caramel chips and it was divine! I followed the advice of some reviewers and used a small microwave safe Pyrex bowl as I don't have jumbo sized mugs. It took around 2 minutes in the microwave.. The hubby and I loved it.. Thank you

I replaced the regular flour with einkorn flour. Other than that I completely followed the recipe. It turned out oily and seemed undercooked, like a really gooey brownie. I tried cooking it longer than the directions called for but it never seem to get really done.

followed recipe to the letter and it was great, though mine was  a tad gooey mostly on top, possibly cause i added a touch more water cause mixing it i thought it was very thick but it taste great all the same, almost like brownies. got some crunches while eating though, possibly sugar didnt mix out very well again because it seemed thick. A recommendation to anyone attempting this, mix it properly in something like a bowl or measuring cup then pour into mug.

My daughter turned me onto this & I absolutely love it.  I added some Snicker Candy bar bits to the batter, Caramel sauce on top after baking & creamy vanilla ice cream to top it all off!!    I also made up 4 baggies of the dry ingredients so all I have to do when I decide another bad boy, all I have to do is add the wet ingredients!!!  Y’all have to make this

I switched out the milk for almond milk  and only put it in for a little over a minute and it came out amazingly! I'm honestly surprised - it's light and fluffy and delicious.

this was soooooo good, very rich but so good. I have never not been able to finish a mug cake but I couldn't finish this one. next time, I'll definitely be added whipped cream to it and maybe subbing the milk for water. I also added chocolate chips to it and I think I went a little overboard. 

the recipe is perfect the way it is though.

I made this recipe exactly the way it is written with the exception of adding a few chocolate chips. This cake turned out perfectly! It is so rich and chocolatey!! So good! I wanted to make this at work for a mid-shift indulgence, so I mixed all the dry ingredients in a large mug and covered it with plastic wrap. Then I mixed all the liquid ingredients in a separate container. I will definitely make this again!

I cannot express how empowering it is to want chocolate cake and then be able to have it within ten minutes. It's pretty darn good considering the minimal effort and all substitutes I use! I share with anyone who will listen haha.

I loved the simplicity and overall taste, texture, and presentation! The mug cake was super fluffy and satisfied my sweet tooth. It only takes a few minutes to mix everything, and has a short cook time in the conventional microwave. What I did to suit my tastes was add a splash more vanilla, and shredded coconut. AMAZING! 10/10 would recommend.

Now normally, I do not tend to rate/review recipes but I've been seeing a recurring issue in the low reviews. It was the infamous OVERFLOWING! So to all of the people who say the cake overflowed, or was bitter/burned, mixing and correct measurements are key when it comes to this recipe. Always be sure to blend the dry ingredients first BEFORE adding the wet ingredients. I used to have this problem when I first attempted this recipe, and it was corrected by my much more experienced mother. The reason the cake overflows is due to poor mixing of the ingredients, NOT the size of the mug (I use and 8oz capacity mug and it works magnificently). So please before you leave a bad review, take some time to understand what went wrong and learn from it. :)

I was very skeptical of this recipe. A super-fast brownie cooked in a microwave sounded to good to be true. With apprehension, I made this for my son who wanted "a little something." I followed the instructions and put the ingredients in a large soup mug. I was surprised and delighted by the result (I stole a couple bites from my son's). With the ease and taste of this, I felt like Super Mom. This is a dream come true.

The first time I made it I added a few milk chocolate chips on top the last few seconds.  The second time I made it I added a little bit of butter and no chocolate chips . After it was done I added a few frozen berries on top! Delicious! You may need to cook it  longer depending on your microwave.  A tall mug or a wide mug is needed otherwise you may have a mess to clean up!  This recipe satisfied my craving for chocolate! Next time I will try using brewed coffee. One reviewer had a hard time cleaning their mug.  I didn't find this was the case for me.  All I did was rinse my mug and let it soak for about 15 min then wash as  usual. No problem here!

I made it both ways.  It was delicious.  I did divide the cake into 2 servings.  I made it again with Learning for Life teens at the high school where I subbed.  They were THRILLED to be able to bake something from scratch.  We made 5 mug cakes for 10 people and topped each serving with low-fat whipped cream.

This cake tasted better than another mug cake I recently tried. The taste was really good, actually  I measured everything exactly, and didn't substitute any ingredients. It was oily and spongy. I will have to fiddle with it to figure out a way to make this recipe acceptable.

I made it with Bisquik- so I didn’t have to add the baking soda or salt. I also used a little less sugar. It was a moist, fluffy, melt in your mouth, velvety chocolate cloud. I put a scoop of Haagen Daz vanilla bean ice cream and some Hershey’s chocolate syrup on top. I agree with what someone said about the texture being way better than mug cake recipes calling for an egg.

It tastes amazing, and its incredibly light and fluffy! 
my only complaint is that it took around 2 minutes and 30 seconds to cook, and even then, one of my mugs was incredibly gooey at the bottom (really no complaint there). next time, i will increase cooking time and see if that helps.

Love it! Made many batches of this for family and friends and everyone loves it! Turns out perfect for all my mugs so people saying it overflowed used a very small mug or added to much.

one of the best I've made. I used rice milk instead of regular milk and it turned out great! Also I used a cappuccino mug which I think helped cook it evenly.

This is absolutely the best mug cake that I have tried. It is fluffy and moist and chocolatey, and makes enough cake for two to have a decent serving. Be sure to microwave it in a soup mug (like for onion soup) or it might overflow. 
I'm glad I added semi-sweet chips to the batter. Scratched my itch for chocolate cake!

Simply great. Exactly what you need to make a little chocolate cake in a mug in about 5 minutes. Here’s a couple tips;
Use a 10oz mug, 8oz and it will overflow.
If your baking powder is expired, don’t expect it to rise like it should.
Measure everything carefully. Negative reviews are full of examples of sloppy measuring.
Mix all dry ingredients, then mix all wet ingredients in a separate cup, pour into dry and stir well!
I add 1/4tsp instant coffee for added depth of flavor.

Really yummy, just make sure you mix the bottom REALLY well and use a big mug. The first time I made it my mug was too small and it went EVERYWHERE. Other than makers error it's great. And if you are like me and never seem to have vanilla extract around but have almond extract it still works and tastes good :)

I wish the recipe had oven wattage included, because I cooked  mine an extra 30 seconds and it still did not get the same finished look as the other pictures, after waiting a bit i just gave up... which turned this into a glorified Brownie Mug thing

This is so fudgy and delicious. I was craving chocolate the other day and found your recipe. I was skeptical about how it would turn out, but I was wrong. I added a scoop of ice cream on top and dove in. I’ve made it 3 times now and I haven’t changed anything. It is perfect just as it is. Plus, now when I am craving chocolate I will make this. Super yummy and ready in no time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

A delicious dessert without having a whole cake around to tempt you all week.
You can also add nuts and put in a bit of frosting.
Perfect!!!

This cake is the bomb! I halved it and omitted the baking soda (because I didn’t have any) and it was perfect! The key is to under”bake” it. I popped it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then dusted with powdered sugar. Soooo delish!

I made this as written and the taste was good, but the portion size was huge! Not at all intended for a "normal" sized mug. I made it in a cereal bowl after reading others' comments, but next time plan to split the batter into two mugs or halve the recipe altogether. It certainly tamed the chocolate craving!

Rated it bases on taste. Moist and yummy! Excellent mug cake.
However, the recipe needs two notes:
1. Recipe as-is makes two servings. If you want one, halve it and use a regular mug and cook for 1 minute.
2. You need to cook it in a mug/bowl/whatever that's at least 2 cups. I used a 1 3/4 cup dish and it overflowed a tiny bit. Two cups should give you just enough space (although I'd consider going even bigger if you add chocolate chips!)

Wow! This was surprisingly quick, easy, simple to make AND delicious. 

I read in other reviews that it should be made in an oversized mug to prevent overflowing - since I didn't have one I used a microwave-safe glass measuring cup , and it doubled as my measuring tool (Tip: you can check whether your glass cups are microwave safe by microwaving them for 1-2 minutes. If the glass is warm or cool then it is safe, if it is hot it is not). 

Instead of 3 tablespoons of milk and 1 table spoon of water, I used 4 tablespoons (or 1/4 cup) of almond milk since that's what I had. The texture was very moist and fluffy, and the flavor very rich. It goes well with whipped cream and a glass of almond milk. I haven't tried it with regular milk yet so I can't compare it to the original recipe. Still delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I had high hopes for this but was so disappointed.  The texture was just weird and the calories were so high for the portion.  Next time I want a quick chocolate fix I'll use the cocoa powder to make a cup of hot chocolate for better taste and a lot less calories.

A delicious and quick treat. I used self raising flour and a generous tablespoon of softened butter instead of oil. To finish off, a tablespoon of dark chocolate chips was sprinkled in the middle. The ingredients were put into a bowl and eaten with a dollop of yogurt. Yum

It cooks throughout evenly at time listed. It’s fast it’s simple.. my only complaint is it’s also pretty tasteless. I Highly recommend adding some sort of chip (chocolate, peanutbutter, caramel, or toffee would all be good) and doubling if not trippling the vanilla, and topping it with honey and fruit maybe.. it’s good enough as is if you’re a plain person it was just bland to me.

This is a quick and easy to make for a chocolate fix. I made this in an oversized cup and it still spilled over the cup. I would split into 2 cups next time.  I was out of milk I used whipped cream instead of milk. I also added walnuts. So it came out more brownie tasting thank cake. Only reason I gave it a 4 star was the over flowing the cup when cooking.

Definitely needs a bowl.  1m in 1200 watt microwave would probably suffice.

Personally, I'm cutting that sugar to 1/4 requested, but the cake itself came out very nicely.  It was fluffy, hot, and perfect.  A scoop and ice cream and I was superbly happy.

Thank you for posting.  Am so making this again!

I wish I'd used less sugar than called for. It was too sweet for me. But the cake turned out light and fluffy.

I have tried nearly every mug cake recipe you could dig up off the interwebz. This was, hands down, the best microwave mug cake recipe I've ever had. The only changes I made were that I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I also added some spices--turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg.Then I added some mini choc chips before baking! Yum! ( sorry, I ate it all before I could get a picture! )

This was a delicious cake! But it was not at all gooey like I thought and the portions were huge! Next time, I would halve this recipe.

Oh my gosh yes!! ?? I was torn on if I should even bother with a mug cake but was swayed by the mom of the teething infant (mine just went down!) And thought that if she thought it was worth it then I should give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did!! I also added a handful of chocolate chips because mug cakes can be dry, and a dash of cinnamon because... Yum...! I cooked it 99 seconds, although it could have gone a few seconds more, the uncooked bottom made almost a melted frosting when I stirred it. Game changer. Recipe stored, printed, screenshotted and shared. I'm probably going to regret having found this....??

I thought this mug cake was fine. I used vegetable oil because I had just ran out of canola and didjtnwant to run to the store. I had a good 1.5 inches from the top of my batter to the top of the mug and I still managed to mess up the microwave pretty good. When I took it out after a minute 30 it was fully done, but was a bit dry. I 
Put about a half tablespoon more milk in and mixed that into the cake (sounds a bit weird) and that helped. I did enjoy the cake in the end it was just much more difficult than it should have been.

This recipe has too much sugar for my family. Based on that alone, I give it 4 stars. What is awesome is that you can reduce the sugar by half and it is still delicious. I made this for 4 ppl by doubling all the ingredients but the sugar. I then divided it into 4 ramekins and microwaved for 1 min 30 sec watching it the entire time to be sure it didn’t overflow. It was the perfect chocolate craving suppressant!

Quick and easy way to satisfy a chocolate craving. Made in a microwave safe bowl. Definitely would have overflowed in my coffee mugs. My suggestion... start with your bowls and work your way down in size the next time you make. Husband loved it!

This mug cake recipe has some of the best proportions of any I've tried! It comes out very light, like regular cake, not dense like a brownie. 

I go a little light on the sugar--just a personal preference of shorting it maybe a half tablespoon. Microwaving it for a minute and a half was perfect in my 700 watt microwave.

I just made this just as the recipe was written and it's fantastic! I added a small handful of chocolate chips and it's light and fluffy. Hubby even likes it better than the big name brand packaged mug cakes. He says it doesn't taste artificial as those ones. It's a keeper!

This was an AWFUL recipe. I was looking to help solve my craving, and I was excited to try out this recipe. When you put it in the microwave it rises and spills out of the mug. Then all the mug cake does is shoot everywhere in your microwave and make a mess, and to top it off it blew the lid off and shot itself everywhere. And when it shot everywhere and burned it didn't even cook so then was no more mug cake left to eat. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND to ANYONE.

I honestly don't get how the 1 star reviewers managed to ruin this unless they just threw everything into the mug and didn't stir it up. The recipe is great as it is, though it's a better idea to make it in a large soup mug, it will run over a standard coffee mug.  If you have a high power microwave start checking for doneness at about the halfway mark and go in 15 second intervals. Stop when it's still just a little liquidey in the middle then let it sit about 5 minutes and the carryover heat will finish cooking it.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there is no warning about using the larger mug.

I did make changes to this recipe. I substituted baking powder in place of the baking soda so it would rise, I eliminated the water but kept the 3 Tbsp milk, and changed the oil to olive oil 1 Tbsp (instead of 2) so I wouldn't be using a GMO oil and the olive oil is a healthy fat as well. (coconut oil is also non GMO for those of you who prefer the coconut oil for cooking and baking)

Fair warning, this is a VERY sweet mug cake. A scoop of vanilla ice cream can help with that as well. But the chocolate is nice and rice and we really liked that part. It's easy to make as well. Also, try using the large mugs to keep it from overflowing the mug. That's about it...enjoy!

Simple to make and very rich and fudgy. I've made other chocolate mug cakes before and realized that with the amount of flour and cocoa being used, this would make a very large portion that an ordinary size coffee mug would not hold. I ended up using a soup bowl which turned out perfect. I would definitely make again.

I always use this mug cake recipe. It would always work and I loved it. However, things started going wrong, so I would always use less than it said. one time I used the recipe and I did everything how it said it spilled over the top and ruined the microwave. Beware this is very hard to clean.

Super yummy! We missed a birthday party due to sick kids and I was looking to scratch the itch of missed cake. Did the trick! I split it with my husband and it was a perfect "small" portion, but on the right day I could easily see eating the whole thing. 

I used an oversized mug for 90 seconds. We added mini-chocolate chips before baking and a little fresh whipped cream on top of the finished cake.

This cake was amazing. It truly reminded me of the mug cakes I made as a kid, and was just the right amount to take care of my craving. I didnt go exactly by the recipe though. Because we never buy all purpose flour I didnt use that, baking soda or salt. Instead I just used 1/4 cup of self rising flour. I also microwaved it for 2 minutes and 15 seconds because it was not done in the time the recipe said. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a quick chocolate fix.

Amazing! The first time I made it, it was too big, so the second time I halved it and put it in a teacup. I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream as soon as it came out of the microwave and O MY GOODNESS!!!! It was heavenly!! More like a brownie than a cake, but I honestly like it more than regular cake! I do agree with another commenter who recommends a minute if you half it.

This is the perfect amount of chocolate, especially with added chocolate chips!   Our microwave must be pretty strong because it only took 1 minute to be done.  I pulled it out when it was a bit gooey, still but since a mug is so small, it kept cooking just enough while I grabbed the Fluff to dab on top. Yummo!

I was craving a chocolate cake but didn’t want to make a whole batch and I didn’t want to go out either. This was perfect, I even did the trick with the chocolate chips in the middle and it was a lava cake. It was fluffy and delicious. The only change I made was that I used soy milk instead of regular milk (exactly the same amount) because that’s the one I had at home (It was also great that I had all of the ingredients at home). No one would ever notice, it was perfect and oh so quick.

My 9yo loves to bake and asked me to find a recipe for a mug cake. I gave her my phone after seeing the great reviews on this one. I sat on the couch the whole time and when she brought it to me, I was very impressed with how tasty this was. Somewhere between a brownie and a rich chocolate cake. Amazing!

I would lessen the sugar and increase the cocoa powder! Overall, it tasted great, but it would've helped if the recipe specified how many watts they cooked the cake with.

I used pancake mix instead of everything else, had no cocoa power... um.. it tasted good. I wish I put smarties in the inside to give more of a chocolate flavor. If you don't have flour or anything like that, Pancake Mix works fine. Also instead of vanilla extract, I used ice cream. Overall, even with the changes I made I like this recipe and will probably use it again when I have the proper materials.

This was surprisingly good! Fudgy, moist and satisfying! I had run out of milk. So, I substituted water and added 1/2 T. of butter. The texture was the closest to standard cake than other versions I have tried, which turned out rubbery.

( note: I didn’t add the cocoa powder, just wanted a vanilla one ) What? A fourth cup of sugar to a fourth cup of flour? I’m not a pro but isn’t that way to much sugar? I tasted the batter and it was super sweet but I trusted y’all when I saw the reviews and because Like I said before I’m not a pro. I put it in the microwave and immediately it overflowed in the mug I used. I put the cup on a plate and put it back. After about 2 minutes It was still not done, but when I dug into it to look at the middle it was just sugar? Like a chewy sugar?!? I’m really not sure how I messed up but yea.

This is really easy to make and tastes good! I actually skipped out on the 1/4 cup sugar entirely (cause that's just doing too much honestly) and used hot chocolate mix (I used dark Swiss Miss) instead of cocoa powder and it takes just as good! I've also substituted canola for olive and coconut oil and just added a little more vanilla and you can't taste the difference...

Quick, easy and delicious! I added white chocolate chips to mine and used a big soup bowl instead of a mug. Will definitely be making again!

I've tried a few different mug cake recipes, and my main complaint about them is the bottom of the cake tends to be too moist and rubbery. This one was very highly reviewed so I thought I'd give it a shot, and maybe an egg free recipe might improve the texture. I'll never know though, because before I could pop it into the microwave it occurred to me that I could just eat the batter. So I did. I couldn't quite finish the whole thing, it was too sweet, but baking it would probably fix that.

So, I do not know how this got so many great reviews. I folled this to a T and it came out like a sad dryish spongy unknown blob that was supposed to be cake. I wish I could share a picture.

DON'T MAKE IN A STANDARD MUG! 
This cake is amazing but it will likely overflow a standard mug. I used one of those microwaveable soup bowls and it was perfect.

Now in terms of how it tastes....I literally created an all recipes account to review this recipe. It tastes amazing, just as is or with some chocolate chips mixed in. Just make sure you use a larger mug and then enjoy!

Great base for whatever you're craving. I made the recipe as written except for the milk (I also had Mexican table cream). At the end I added about a tablespoon of peanut butter and a handful  dark chocolate chips. Absolutely delightful and better than some store bought cakes I've bought.

This has a really nice texture but in my opinion is not sweet/chocolatey enough unless you add about a handful of chocolate chips! Delicious

I made this on a night I had no snacks readily available. This was very quick to make, I adjusted the recipe to 3 tablespoons of butter because I had no oil. It worked out great but definitely need to use a very large mug or possibly a bowl even. If you have a small mug I suggest putting a paper plate under it  due to the boil over

This turned out spectacular! In the past, I have tried making mug cakes, and they always turn out dry, undercooked, burnt, or tasting of flour. I think the simple nature of the recipe, coupled with the right amount of ingredients, makes for an awesome, easy mug cake.

I've now made this about 4 times for my wife. I've replaced the sugar with Splenda, quickly added a few semi-sweet chocolate chips to the center of the cake after baking, added a shot of whipped cream and lightly drizzled back and forth with Hershey's chocolate syrup over the top. (Aprx 6 choc chips, 2 tbsp whipped cream and maybe 2 tsp of choc syrup)

I would make it again but I'd cook it a little longer because mine came out as a thick batter but I still ate it without recooking it because I was told lazy to recook it.  I also added cinnamon.

Being eggless is awesome and many family members are dairy intolerant or allergic so this recipe is easy to change with any dairy-free alternative. I've also made it as a vanilla mug cake by doubling the vanilla and omitting the cocoa powder to success!

Awesome! I was short on milk and canola oil so I used almond milk and vegetable oil instead and it was gorgeous. I've tried to make mug cake before and it always felt like eating a flavorless sponge until today. It was moist and if you let it sit, it will develope a muffin like texture. Next time I'm gonna try a microwavable bowl and adjust the measurement according to that.

This is a large mug cake, for sure. The ingredient quantities are larger than the other recipe I use, and you definitely need to use a small mixing bowl or two mugs for microwaving. The taste is pretty good but I think it could have been more chocolatey. Choc. chips would probably help. The texture was good for a mug (eggless) cake. I didn't change any quantities or ingredients.

I made it in a 1 qt. Pyrex bowl and microwaved for 1 min. 30. It’s not as sweet as a box cake, kids might enjoy the chocolate chips but it’s a great recipe.

Very delicious especially since my wife does soy milk and I use regular. And it is also small enough to feel guilt free if you don't want to make a whole chocolate sheet.

I added some chocolate chips (about 1/4 cup) and used a heavy cereal bowl (it makes a LOT of batter, enough for two people).  Topped it with some whipped cream—very rich and delicious!

I altered just a slight bit.. instead of 2 tbsp of cocoa powder I used 3 tbsp and it came out perfect! I thought the cocoa powder ratio to the sugar seemed a little low. In fact I'd say if you used equal parts of sugar and cocoa powder (1/4c = 4tbsp) it would come out even better. You usually want an equal or close-to sugar:cocoa powder (more sugar than cocoa if ratio isn't equal). Besides that, I've tried a couple mug cake recipes and this one has been the best yet. I also mixed in SS choco chips and cooked for 2:20

That's the most delicious mug cake I've ever tasted! I was always making ones that were too dry but this one for me is foolproof! Just a query, though, I've been wondering if I could lower the sugar content?

Chocolate chips in the mix makes it sweeter, also this is a very rich flavor so a cup of milk on the side is an excellent compliment with the cake. DONT ADD MORE LIQUID IN THE MIX it will be to mushy and if you try to cook it longer it will BURN!!!

Great cake! However, I doubled it and split it between 2 large (5” diameter) cereal bowls and it filled the bowls almost completely when cooked. I don’t think it’ll fit in a mug.....hence the minus one star. Otherwise, it was awesome! I did add chocolate chips, pecans and a little coconut. I topped it with ice cream and it hit the spot!

It was just what I needed to satisfy my chocolate craving. It was
quick and easy and very chocolaty. If I had only had some vanilla ice cream to go on top it would have been perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly as written except I used vegetable oil instead of canola.  Didn’t have any canola oil.  I mixed the dry ingredients, then added the milk & milk as I mixed.  It came out excellent. It was fluffy, not too rich or sweet.  I also used an oversized mug.  It was more than enough to split between my husband & I.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar.  It was yummy.   I’m thinking that those who didn’t have success with this recipe either used the wrong type of flour or didn’t mix the dry ingredients enough.  It really came out great.

This is a great treat when you need something warm, chocolatey, comforting, and quick. I usually divide this recipe into 2 mugs.  This is also a great recipe for mixing up the dry ingredients beforehand in baggies so you just have to add liquid when you want a quick dessert. Sometimes, I use Kahlua instead of vanilla for a change, but is definitely good as written.

I loved this version of the mug cake.  The cake was very chocolatey, moist, yet fluffy and tender..it was so much better than I expected and much better than other recipes I've tried.  I used melted butter instead of oil, that's the only change I made.  It was perfect for a chocolate fix in a hurry.  I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This is AWESOME just as it is!  No need to change a thing.  Very easy to make & is the perfect size for one.  After 1:45 it came out moist, fluffy and delicious.  My kids are napping, my husband is working and I am enjoying this (in silence ??) with a scoop of ice cream.  Today is a very good day!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for an amazing treat!!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I’ve had, and I’m not even especially fond of chocolate. My only suggestion is to use a bowl or very big mug.

It was pretty good, albeit a little fudge-y. I added around two tablespoons of Nutella, and a little extra vanilla because I enjoy the vanilla flavor. I also added very little coffee, as it helps accentuate the chocolate. I ate it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Perfect for a calorie-filled cheat meat.

This recipe is really simple and easy to make. I used a BIG mug because it makes a pretty big mug cake, but it came out DELICIOUS! It took me about 5 minutes total. I microwaved for the mentioned 1 minute and 45 seconds and that was perfect. I highly recommend if you are looking for a quick chocolate fix (:

My husband was craving something sweet, I wanted to make something quickly that wouldn't dirty a bunch of dishes and this was perfect! I made it exactly as written, my husband put a dollop of peanut butter on his, it was exactly what we needed.

This recipe was fantastic. I have always followed  a recipe that calls for egg, but this is SO MUCH BETTER. Don’t do the egg recipe. The cake was light and fluffy, almost like a box cake. I’m beyond impressed. I cut the sugar down, and then I made a little frosting using butter, cocoa powder and powdered sugar.

This hit the spot! Made as written with the addition of a few milk chocolate chips on top. Very rich so I had some whipped cream with it. Next time I’d try a Tablespoon of coffee to replace the water. Yum.

WOW!!!  Such decadence and so easy.  Made this while hubby took his shower.  It was cooled by the time dinner was over.  I substituted water for the milk and  applesauce for the canola oil.  YUMMY!!

I thought this recipe was great.  Had a sweet tooth and whipped this up and it filled the void.  I did not have cocoa powder so I used hershey syrup instead.  I did microwave it about 2 1/2 minutes.

I’ve tried a lot of  microwave mug cakes and all were very dry.  I love there isn’t an egg.  I made a couple of changes.  I didn’t have canola oil, so I used vegetable oil instead. I also used a cereal bowl as suggested by another reviewer and added a dollop of peanut butter and chocolate chips.  It came out perfect!  It was so moist and light!  It bounced back when touched.  This will be my new remedy for my chocolate craving.

So let me get this straight, you put 3/4 C dry ingredients with 1/4 liquid ingredients (including baking soda which causes cakes to raise) into a 6oz mug and then was SURPRISED it overflowed???? For me the  recipe was easy and tasty, but I needed ice cream as a topper. BTW I used my 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup. After microwaving,  I covered it and let it stand for about 1 min.

I liked the flavor of the recipe, but do appreciate other mug cake recipes that are mixed right in the mug. This one made for extra dishes!  Instead of mixing in the extra flavor ingredients before adding the flour, I mixed in flour then divided up the batter to the individual mugs and family members added personal choices of extras.  I used a mixed berry compote, white chocolate chips with a couple of snakes of cinnamon! Yum!

When I made it last night, it tasted a bit dry and salty.  Since I didn't have any canola oil, I used the canola oil spay and spritzed it into the mix.  Though it was edible,  I wondered what would wrong. Maybe I try to make it again someday and see if it would taste better.

I just made this for a treat for myself. I followed the ingredients and instructions, just adding some mini chocolate chips. Do use a large mug. I used one of my soup mugs...it will now become my cake mug. I ate it (very carefully) right out of the microwave. Next time I will do a better job of incorporating the dry and wet ingredients. I had some sugar and flour granules on the bottom of my mug. I may also shave off a few seconds to achieve that molten chocolate that another reviewer mentioned. Looking forward to cold winter nights with a cup of hot cake in front of the fire!

This was good as far as mug cakes go. Usually I am not a fan of mug cakes because they have egg ( microwave make the egg taste gross). That being said, my daughter really wanted to try this recipe. To my surprise it was good! We will definitely be saving this lil gem.

I tried making the double amount,  but it seemed the right amount for 1 mug,  so I put the whole thing in,  and it EXPLODED!  Oh, well,  I will STILL make this again the RIGHT way next time!

I made this recipe exactly as written (including microwave time) and it came out perfectly cooked. Such a treat for so little work! The center was fully cooked, so for those who want it fudgy, you may want to reduce cooking time. I mixed and cooked mine in a 2 cup round glass baking dish and it filled right to the top; since 2c = 16oz, if you use a 16oz mug you should avoid overflow. I will be making this again, and maybe I'll try some of the add-ins other reviewers have suggested!

I doubled the recipe, and i made it in a larger mug, because mug cakes are messy. It's a little dry but other than that very good!

Amazing! So simple, easy, fast & delicious! I added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips. This is a favorite recipe to keep on hand.

This recipe was great. I cooked it for 1 min 30 seconds so it wasn't to hot and it still came out great. It was really moist and chewy. not hard at all. I put some vanilla ice cream on the top so I could eat it while it was still hot and it tasted delicious. Definitly recommend this

For the first time baking in my entire life, this recipe was great and easy to follow. Second time I made it I even replaced one tablespoon of cocoa powder with a table spoon of ground cinnamon, turned out great. Would be perfect to have with a tall glass of milk on a cold December night.

Didn't have any canola oil so I used 2tbsp of mashed banana and it worked great! Definitely had a banana taste underlying the chocolate but the consistency was not affected (considering this is made in a microwave).

Perfect!  I swapped coconut oil for the canola, & used 1.5 tbs cocoa + .5 tbs instant coffee to intensify the chocolate.  I also took the suggestion & added 1/8 cup of chocolate chips—this will be my go-to when I need a quick dessert!

By far the best mug cake I’ve tried. This is actually the 3rd night in a row I tried a mug cake. This one was actually very good. The first 2 I tried were rubbery and blah! Saving this one for when I need a sweet, chocolaty fix! I did use almond milk bc that’s what we had on hand. I subbed 1 Tbs of butter for 1 of the Tbs of oil. And I sprinkled a few mini semi-sweet morsels on top before putting in microwave. And I microwaved for 1 min 40 sec. Surprisingly tasty!

Tasted great, but cooking time was too long for our Panasonic microwave, I guess. Burnt to a crisp and was hard enough to probably give someone a concussion if I through it at them. I also believe the recipe called for too little liquids. Fix this madness! but tasted good.

The mug cakes were delicious! They were a little dry despite adding a tablespoon  more of milk, so the next few turned out great when I cooked them in the microwave for one minute and then 15 more seconds. I also used  very large mugs so they don’t spill out. They turned out perfect this way! I guess it depends on your microwave. I stuck a toothpick all the way in the middle and if the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is cooked! Enjoy!

This was so easy to make and really hit the chocolate craving I had.  I was fighting my 3 children off from eating it (9, 8 and 3), because it was that tasty, although I did share it with them.  I did use less sugar than the recipe called for (3 Tbsp instead of 4) and I added a teaspoon of instant coffee to punch up the chocolate flavor.  To finish it off I put in 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and microwaved it for the time the recipe called for.  It came out perfect and we will definitely be making this again.  Simply delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and added chocolate chips. I only cooked it for a minute and 30 seconds and it was perfect and fluffy. The chocolate chips sank to the bottom and created a molten chocolate cake.  10/10 delicious. Exactly what I was looking for.

Followed the given recipes to the T. Only thing that I did different was the cooking time in microwave. My microwave is 900 W, hence I cooked it for 1 minute and 50 seconds. 
it turned out delicious, moist chocolatey yum yum...

I doubled the recipe and made it in a bowl, and cooked accordingly. Only thing I altered was I added a handful of chocolate chips. Wow! Wonderful dessert if you’re craving something and realize you haven’t baked. Will definitely be making this again!

This cake is excellent! I added a tablespoon of bourbon and a small handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Cooked it exactly as the recipe directed and it turned out perfect.

I was craving something sweet and gave this recipe a try. It is awesome. I used an oversized mug and it was perfect. I honestly think this recipe would make enough cake to share with another person, especially if you intend to eat it with ice cream. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The cake came out great! But I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, but used the same quantities of each that is listed. The substitutions were baking powder, coconut oil and almond milk. Still came out delicious. Great recipe for those chocolate cravings!

I made the recipe used four tablespoons of milk instead of three with one of water and used olive instead of vegtable oil and it came out well has the consistency of a light brownie more than anything and took 2 minute to make its a nice easy recipe for satisfying chocolate cravings

One of the most delicious cakes I have ever eaten. A masterpiece in a cup.  

For all the vegans out there, I substituted the milk for plain water and it still came out delightful. 10 out of 10 would eat it again. A great treat.

This cake really satisfies. It's light and fluffy, yet somehow dense and rich at the same time. I made this then got three spoons and there was plenty to share with my wife and daughter. I will be making this again.

I made this for my sister and she had a great idea to add semi-sweetemed chocolate chips to the recipe. She also thought it would be great to frost it with coconut pecan frosting! It's really tastes kind of like German chocolate cake! Haha it's great!!

Really quick and easy to make. My substitutions are almond milk, half granular sugar and half turbinado sugar, sea salt and mix in 1tbs cacao nibs. I also under cook a bit at 1:35min.
 Wish it were less calories but I guess it wouldn’t taste so good if it were. ?? I use a tall mug for it as it cooks up then sinks down. I feel like it makes about 2 cupcakes worth of cake.

Really simple and tasty. I might try it at a slightly shorter time for a moister cake. My microwave seems to run a little hotter than others.

Fantastic! I made mine in a 2 cup pyrex glass food storage dish, and that worked out perfectly. Flipped it over onto a plate after cooking because the dish got too hot for my kids to handle, and I'm hearing "mmmm" and "yum yum" coming  from the other room as I type. :)

This turned out wonderful! I doubled the recipe and microwaved it for 2 minutes, and it had a great gooey texture. Tastes like good chocolate cake! I used an oversized soup bowl and had no messes! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I should have mixed the dry ingredients before I added the wet, I had tiny clumps of flour.  Still tasted great though!  Use a really large mug so you don’t have to worry about overflow (mine was 16 ounces)

After reading some of the reviews, I made the recipe with the following changes: I used dark cocoa and vegetable oil instead of Canola because that's what I had. I think Canola oil has a funny taste and that may be what some people didn't like.  I cooked it on a little lower setting on my microwave to keep it from running over or exploding.  I tasted the batter and it was great, but the finished cake tasted funny, almost a burned , unpleasant taste, and it was too salty, like others said.  I thought I'd try it again before giving up on it because I really liked the idea of no egg.  The second time, I subbed baking powder for the baking soda and just put in a pinch of salt.  This time it was perfect and fluffy.  It wasn't really sweet,but that might be because of the dark cocoa.  If I had used chocolate chips, I think it would have been just right.  Also, I couldn't wait to taste it, and it did have a bit of an off taste.  But once it cooled, that taste was gone.

Made this in a large mug and substituted vegan Bailley’s for the milk. Delicious! Added some nutmeg as well.

Every mug cake I have ever made (since they became a thing) was a catastrophic failure. This recipe broke the tradition of "hideous abominations coming to life inside the microwave" and it tasted AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly and boy am I glad. Thank you!!!???

This is amazing!!  Made it exactly as the recipe - with 3 kids 3 and under who miraculously are napping at the same time, I was craving something to go with tea so I could just have a rare few minutes in peace and indulge a little until they woke up....so no time to read other reviews!  I used a large mug as the recipe called for and it was perfect; warm gooey moist chocolate cake.  Love that it doesn’t need eggs and uses ingredients I usually have on hand - because I’m most definitely going to make this again!  Now I need to make sure I get chocolate chips to hide in the pantry for the next time!
Only one problem - I need to now make sure the aroma of warm chocolate cake disappears before my toddler wakes up!!

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding chocolate chips. I had to turn off the microwave a few times in the last 45 seconds to stop it from overflowing. I just let it drop and turned  the microwave back on.  I nice small portion of chocolate cake that can be made quickly to satisfy my love of chocolate.

Yummy! So easy to make and so delish! I was craving chocolate and didn’t have anything good so I thought what the heck? This was so satisfying and perfect! I put a handful of chocolate chips in it as well, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I highly recommend this if you’re looking for a sweet treat that’s quick and easy! It has a really nice cake texture and great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Best mug cake recipe I've made. :) Used an over-sized mug, but the portion was too much for me to eat alone. So now I split the batter into 2 regular sized mugs, and have a spare to share. :)

I used a large mug (about 10oz) and cooked it at 60% power for a minute, checked it and then for another minute again at 60%. Our microwave’s output is 1000w. The second mug I did I put in for 2 & 1/2 mins at 50%  they both came out pretty good. You might have to tweak it depending on your microwave.

Perfect mug cake. As everyone else stated its crutial to use an over sized mug/small bowl. Also doesn't hurt to give it a spritz of cooking spray so it doesn't stick so much. Replaced the canola oil with some thc coconut oil and got lit. 10/10 will make again

Mine turned out perfect. As said in other reviews follow the recipe exactly , use a large mug and only fill the mug half way to give the cake space to rise. I added the chocolate chips inside the cake and with every other bite you take the chocolate chips. I also topped it with French  vanilla ice cream. Soooooo good.

I made it and it is so delicious!!! At first I worried if it would all fit in one tiny cup so I did it in a taller mason jar and it turns out it actually would’ve fitted perfectly in a cup. I also put it in the microwave for 2 minutes but to be honest 1 minute 45 seconds would’ve been just enough leaving the inside a bit chewy like a brownie! Over all it was just soooo yummy ??

Quick and easy! I used cake flour and it made a light and tender texture! I used stevia instead of sugar, and non-dairy creamer instead of milk (dairy allergies in the house!) The second time I made it I threw in a handful of mixed nuts and that gave it a nice finish!

Very tasty and will definitely make this again!

I have never made a mug cake before and I was pleasantly surprised by its moistness...and all in under 10 mins?  The longest part of the recipe was taking out and putting away the ingredients.  I used a latte mug/bowl and it was the perfect size for the recipe.  It was done to perfection in 1 min 45 secs.  What a delightful little piece of heaven when you are having a chocolate craving that needs immediate attention.  Next time I will try adding some chocolate chips to the recipe for some added ooey gooey goodness!  Thanks for sharing.

I believe it was over baked, I made another recipe that had all the same ingredients (I think it might have had more amounts of stuff in it too) but it baked  for 45 seconds, it was much better(AKA not hard as a brick) it was also VERY good after being chilled in the refrigerator.

Warning: I made this, it's alright for a quick sweet craving but it's dense and not very flavorful like normal chocolate cake would be. It's not good but it's not bad, decent at best

I loved this!  I did notice the measurements were going to be too much for a mug so I made it in a small microwave bowl.  I topped mine with whipped cream and it was a perfect little treat.

Just made this and it is perfect. I did not change a thing. It came out of the microwave in 1 minute and 45 seconds and I added some ice cream and it was ready to go. Very tasty, warm and exactly what we wanted. You do need to use a big mug.

I was super excited to do it.. I even did it in a bowl, however it also spilled and never got to the cake consistency.. it is more of a pudding as a matter of fact. I am so disappointed :(

Easy and delicious! I added cinnamon into the dry mixture to give it an extra zing and it was well worth it. I also added chocolate chips. After its cooked, add a swirl of whipped cream to perfectly top it off.

I’ve had a few mug cakes recently, and this one definitely takes the cake (ha see what I did there). Overall everything was good, but I checked the calorie limit and it’s 603 calories. I’m not blaming anyone since it’s expected to be eating a lot of sugar and fat, but  really make sure you check before (if you’re dieting). I probably won’t be trying this  again unless I really need to.

Awesome recipe but I would recommend sharing the cake with another person because after eating the whole cake by yourself you probably won't feel to well the taste of the cake is spot on but it is a lot to eat... well at least for me if you eat the whole cake then you do you !!!

Oh MAN!! I just made this for myself. I am watching my calories but figured I could allow for a half portion. Even half of this was SO VERY SATISFYING!! And ready so quickly! I subbed some leftover brewed coffee for the water, and added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top but those are the only deviations. From reading others' reviews, I used a large ceramic cereal bowl, and had NO problem with it 'blowing up' or being hard to wash. The texture was soft and fluffy, there was a tiny bit of creaminess along the edges, and so chocolately!! I can imagine future changes like peppermint extract instead of vanilla,  or a few walnuts for crunch...Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

I am eating this now as I type! This recipe was really good! Perfect consistency with a light, airy texture. It took about 9 minutes to make- with the prep and everything, but the end was so worth it. And especially if you have it with vanilla ice cream... yum! I added chocolate chips and it turned out so good! Thanks for this recipe, as I'll be sure to make it again!

I wanted it to be healthier so I substituted oat flour for regular flour, erythritol with monk fruit sweetener for the sugar and used olive oil. It was so tasty and SO sweet. I’ll probably use a little less sweetener next time. It was exactly what I was craving!!

After reading the reviews and seeing how much batter there is, I decided to make this mug cake in a very small, round pyrex dish instead. I really think this recipe could serve two people after a filling dinner. It turned out perfectly, and I even used the recommended microwave cook time. This recipe makes it entirely too easy to accommodate that chocolate craving!

I love this. I've made it like 3 times now haha. However I did find it dry. Even though I followed the recipe completely. The time though I felt like it needed more than what was adviced because it looked quite under done. So I put it for 2mins.

Easy, fast and super yummy!! I doubled it and put in a super big cup and added another 1 minute in the microwave. Turned out great! There's so many possibilities of "toppings" (peanut butter, white chocolate, carmel...where do I stop!?). I can't wait to try again!

Helped my 8 year old granddaughter make this recipe.  Didn't change a thing.  Used a soup mug and 1100 watt microwave oven.  It only took 1:30 to cook.  It was easy for her to make and she loved it.  She said to give it 6 stars!

This cake was ok. Easy and quick, and turned out really moist and chocolatey. my only issue was that it had a distinct oil taste, so next time I will probably use butter instead.

Throw away every other mug cake recipe - the search is over! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I've probably tried 10 other recipes and they're always rubbery - not this one! Chocolatey, fluffy, and a great size to kill a chocolate craving.

Super yummy! My daughter and I love this easy-to-make cake! I followed the directions exactly making a double batch, and only cooked my cake for about 1.5 minutes. It turns out a bit gooey, but it's so good that way. It didn't blow up, but I watched it while cooking and stopped it when I saw it rising above the lip of the mug. I had mine in a tall mug, but a wide mug works well too. I've made it twice.

I made this for my grandson. I had made another cake, but he ONLY likes chocolate, so I did what any grandma would do and made him a mini chocolate cake. I listened to what some other reviewers had said and made it in a 2 cup measuring cup. (Didn’t want it to spill over) I did add some mini chocolate chips and some cinnamon. I thought it was delicious and so did my grandson. (I only gave him half of it because it made plenty for 2, in my opinion.) It had the consistency of a fudge brownie.

Very good (but large!) mug cake.  I think I would have liked it a little sweeter so I would add more sugar if I make it again.  Also, make sure you have a glass of milk to drink with it!

Tastes pretty good for only taking 10 minutes, tops. Doesn't perfectly taste like real chocolate cake, but hey, it was made in the microwave. I wasn't expecting it to even cook properly. I just remembered that people were adding chocolate chips into theirs, and I'm cursing myself for not thinking to do that. I only had a little bit of milk so I added that plus 3 tablespoons of water and about 1 teaspoon of melted butter, and it turned out okay. I'd like to retry it with all the proper ingredients, plus chocolate chips.

It was amazing. I added about 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Adding cinnamon made the cake great. When it was cooled I added a little chocolate syrup and a vanilla glaze. Just before I ate it I put cool whip one top. Must pour a glass of skim milk then eat. Best microwave cake I have ever had. Left out the chocolate chips.

Made it exactly like the recipe stated, only in a larger soup bowl as reviewers have suggested. It was perfect. I added some nutella in the middle and white chocolate chips. It is fluffy, moist, and soo yummy.

No changes at all except to add a few pecans which was great.  Sprinkled milk chocolate chips over it after it came out of the microwave.  Cooked 1 minute 17 seconds and that was a little too long in my microwave  Next time will try about 10 seconds less.  Also - this is, in my opinion, enough for two people.  Next time will try making half this amount and use only 2 TBSP of flour and sugar and 1 TBSP of cocoa.  Otherwise it was great!

This is delicious, I would recommend not microwaveing it as much as it says if you want more of a lava cake texture, I did mine for 40 seconds, but it depends on your microwave.

wow, this was a great mug cake! i will admit, i wanted to feel like i was being healthy so i did make a few changes. i used almond flour instead of regular, and stevia baking mix instead of straight sugar. i also used 1 tbsp. plain Greek yogurt and 2  tbsp. milk instead of all 3 tblsp. milk. i also broke up one square of 90% chocolate (2 extra carbs) and added it on top. this turned out more like warm chocolate custard to me after 1 minute, 45 seconds, but let me tell you, it was delicious!!!!!! DELICIOUS!!! last week i tried a similar recipe and it turned out like bland chocolate sponge, and i was SO SO disappointed. this...THIS is a keeper for sure!!!! i may use butter instead of oil next time just because that is my preference when baking, but overall, this recipe is amazing!! One last thing..  definitely use more than a mug if u use the whole mix in one container. like other reviewers have said, this recipe grows quite a bit in the microwave, and mine overflowed out of a 4 cup mini casserole type dish. this cake would be super awesome with vanilla ice cream on top too!!! highly recommend giving this one a try. so quick, and best mug cake i have ever tried. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS!!!!

This was amazing, but more like two servings. Great on a hot summer evening when you don’t want to bake. I followed suggestions and decreased the sugar to three tbs and increased the cocoa to approximately 2-1/2 tbs. Eat with whipped cream. Yum. UPDATE:  I changed the proportions for a smaller but still generous serving.  I used: 2 tbs flour, 1 tbs sugar, 1 generous tbs cocoa, 2 tsp oil, 2 tbs milk, 1/16 tsp salt, 1/16 tsp baking soda, 1/8 tsp vanilla or coffee extract. You may need to thin it slightly with a bit more milk or water.  I usually add 3-4 or walnut halves chopped finely or a smattering of peanut butter chips.  Cook for 1 min, and add time by 10 sec intervals if necessary (it probably won’t be).  You could increase the sugar to 1-1/2 tbs if you like it sweeter. Perfect and very sinful.

AHH! My guilty pleasure. This recipe is delicious  but beware; you need a big mug. Also be conscious of the fact that microwave times DO vary in the slightest... I forgot to take a picture of what it looked like right when it was finished but this is after I’d eaten some.

Cooking time is way too long!!!
I cooked for 1 minute and it is still dry and overcooked. If you have a kind of recent microwave cut down the cooking time.

I’ve been trying different mug cake recipes, trying to find that one that stands out from the rest. I didn’t realize how adding eggs make them “heavy”. This recipe is delicious! Just make sure you use a big mug

Texture is decent for a mug cake, but way way way too sweet. Would cut the sugar in half in the future, some of it didn’t even dissolve.

Delicious! It's more fudgy-brownie than cake like, which is the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, but I am never gonna turn down a fudgy brownie over cake!!! Definitely cover the top of the mug with a plate so it doesn't spill over. I microwaved it for 2:10 and let it cool down before digging in. Yum

It’s kind of perfect. Seriously. Use a generous size mug though, it puffs up a lot. I substitute almond milk and it turns out great.

Mine ended up a bit dry. I could have over baked it as all microwaves are diffrent. I will add more milk or water next time.

This is a great recipe for a dessert for one or two. I used a 16oz mug - this was plenty of room for the cake and some ice cream or whipped cream. Making two was no more effort than making one.  I like mixing the ingredients directly in the mug. It's a little difficult dealing with the very small amounts of some ingredients - such as 1/8 tsp salt.

I microwaved each mug separately exactly the time in the recipe. They were ever so slightly gooey and oh so good.

OMG SOOOO GOOD!  I have to admit that I was worried because all I had on hand was whole wheat flour and EVOO.  I honestly thought "Oh well, at least I won't waste a lot of ingredients if it's gross..."  Boy, was I wrong!  I sooooo enjoyed every bite.  Next time, I will try it with the applesauce.

Yes, it's a bit grittier than a cake with all purpose, but SOOOO worth it!

I always try a new recipe as written   This one is awesome!  I wouldn't change a thing!  The trick is to add a scoop of ice cream and hide in the closet---because everyone around you will want to share!  Kudos to you Safinabakes1231!!

I never made a mug cake that tasted so good!! My kids wanted more so the second cup I made, I switched out chocolate powder for chocolate CHIPS and baking soda for baking POWDER and it made it even better! Thank you so much for sharing thisthis recipe! I'm saving it for another emergency dessert situation like tonight!

Yes, definitely use an oversized mug, guys.
It came out very dry the first time around so today I added an extra tablespoon of milk and microwaved it for 2+ minutes on 80% power instead of 100%/high. Looks like it came out a bit better this time.
My boyfriend loves when I make these for him though. I add coconut extract + flakes to his, and sliced almonds to mine. Topped with choc syrup and powdered sugar. ??

Holy smokes! This the best mug cake that I have found and made yet! I made it in a French onion soup bowl which was the perfect size! I used whole wheat flour and the unsweetened applesauce with water! Topped it off with a handful of mini chocolate chips as soon as it came out of the microwave! It was moist and well, there isn’t any left.....

Amazing!!  Followed the recipe as listed and stirred  about a tablespoon of chocolate chips and a pinch of cinnamon into the batter before cooking.  My microwave is super old and low power-I found 2 minutes to be the perfect amount of time to cook.  Top it with a mound of whipped cream and enjoh!  I’ve made this 3 nights in a row ; )

PS Use an oversized mug or it will overflow in your microwave!

This is by far the best mug cake I have tried. I still think a  mug cake does not taste like an actual cake, but this one is decent and tasty and very good at satisfying a craving. I did not have chocolate chips at hand so instead I whipped a light chocolate icing and spread it on top which really helped make the cake taste richer. 

Note: my mug was small for the amounrs mentioned so I opted for a big soup bowl.

Made this cake with artificial sweetener, coconut oil, and black coffee. It didn't rise very well, probable because  it didn't  contain sugar, but it was really delicious. Will make this again.

Great depression snack, however I couldn't seem to get mine to actually cook through all the way? I ended up keeping it in the microwave for an extra minute and it was still uncooked in the middle, plus overcooking it made the parts that were actually cooked dry. Maybe it was just my microwave, though. Fun tip, I usually add caramel or peanut butter to the center right after it's done in the microwave

I agree with Chris on the mention of a larger mug. I thankfully got mine out *just* in time before over flow.
I added more sugar, since I like my cakes super sweet. When I transported the batter into a larger mug and resumed cooking it, I'm not sure if it's because I added more sugar, or if it's because I stopped and cooked it again, but it was VERY chewy.  Comparable to an end - brownie being left out, not quite hard but not soft either. I found myself chewing it forever. The flavor was lovely though.

Delicious! Just what I need to satisfy my sweets/cake craving. I used chocolate chips and a tsp of cinnamon just to give it some extra flavor. When I tried it the first time I didn't add anything else, it was pretty bland and didn't have much of a chocolaty flavor. Overall I think it's a great recipe!

Yum!  I added nutella in the middle, because I love nutella as a addition in mug cakes.  I love THIS!  Totally recommend this if you are crazy over making chocolate desserts.

This turned out great for me! Use a good sized mug to prevent spilling. Added some chocolate chips which added a good chocolatey flavor. It's a little bit dry, so I would add a topper (like frosting or a big scoop of vanilla ice cream)!

Wow, this really tastes like chocolate cake but with less mess, time and in a mug! Followed the recipe except reduced the sugar as I don't like it too sweet and put whip cream on top. Couldn't believe the great cakey texture. It's almost too easy, will be making again!

I just made this and then decided to make an account to review it for 5 stars. Hands down best chocolate mug cake I have ever made. It was decadent and mouthwatering deliciousness in a mug. I favorited it and will be making it again next time I crave a chocolatey cakey dessert!

Perfect for that"I must have cake" moment. Used a soup mug. No overflowing what so ever. Didn't change anything. Good crumb texture. Only caveat, resist the temptation to double the recipe, you will eat it.

so happy to find cake in a mug that does not contain egg.
i decreased the oil to 1 tbl and increased the water by 1 tbl.
sometimes i add a tbl of mini-chocolate chips half way through cooking.  it works as frosting.     one serving of cake instead of a whole cake.

I never review things but I've made a couple other recipes for this kind of thing and they were not good. This one was fantastic. I made it exactly as it is and ate the whole thing, then had to make another one for my kids to split. First time I've had one that is Fluffy and chocolatey and actually taste like a slice of chocolate cake. Do need to use an oversized mug. Fantastic job making this recipe, thank you.

This turned out so great.  I made it with my seven year old daughter and she was so excited she could make it herself.  I was just looking for something simple for her to cook and was shocked at how well it turned out.  She is super proud to be able to "make a cake" all by herself.  Great recipe!

So I was desperate for chocolate and I wanted like a gooey brownie but I found this recipe. So I followed the recipe except I used butter instead of oil. I microwaved it for less time and it turned out gooey and delicious!!! It doesn't taste like flour, like other mug recipes do! YUM and THANK YOU!

I made the recipe as written. I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top. The cake was very light. Good texture and tasty.  I judged by the measurements  off the ingredients that a standard mug wouldn't hold it. I used a small bowl and worked like a charm.

Made no changes, perfect as is! I didn't have choc chips and it was still chocolatey and rich. I'm sure it would be good with them too though :) Will def make again.

I am not typically a fan of mug cakes because I think they turn spongy, but, this is an exception!  The cake was rich and chocolaty and a nice quick treat!  It was denser than a baked cake, but, it was still very good.

This was fast, easy and absolutely delicious! I added a small handful of chocolate chips to the center of it right before microwaving for 1 minute 25 seconds in my 1150 watt microwave.  It came out perfect! The suggested amount of time had the first one come out a bit too dry for my liking.  It was amazing topped with whipped cream.  Hubby and I will be enjoying this recipe again!  Thank you for posting!

This was fantastic and easy to make! Like one review said; make in over sized mug or a bowl because it does make a lot. Great on its own but next time I think I'll add some vanilla icing to it. If you're craving chocolate, and on a budget or don't want to eat a whole cake, this is for you!

This was easy to mix up for a quick chocolate fix.  I used an oversized coffee mug and that was perfect.  In less than 2 minutes, I had a light, fluffy chocolate cake, except that I wasn't very impressed by the depth of the chocolate flavor.  I felt this cake really needed chocolate chips to give a richer chocolate taste.  It was also slightly dry after 1 minute, 45 seconds in the microwave, but I'll blame that on having a powerful microwave.  It could have used 15 seconds less.

Brilliant! Well, at least for a mug cake! I've had several gloppy ones made with egg and never expected one without egg to work so well.  It's very chocolatey, and has a surprisingly pleasant cake texture.  This makes a LARGE mug full...you could split it between 2 normal sized mugs and it would be a perfect serving (would need to reduce cooking time). I use1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp applesauce and that worked fine.  Would be great with add-ins like peanut butter chips or a drizzle of vanilla icing to balance the chocolate taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Honestly, I ate the raw mix before I even cooked it..and it was delicious! I ended up making an other one and actually cooked it this time. It went well, no mess and nothing to complain about. Love this recipe!

I made this little piece of Heaven-in-a-mug after a particularly stressful day at work, and it was just what the doctor ordered. Quick, easy and moist, chocolatey perfection. I sprinkled on mini chocolate chips and drizzled Hershey’s chocolate syrup over the top. Yum!

Pretty good. I've had some terrible ones but this one was good. It wasn't floury as some mug cakes turn out sometimes. Very rich, chocolatey, and moist.

Amazing! This totally hit the spot! Timing was perfect. I didn't have milk so I substituted the milk and water with 4T of rice milk. I also mixed some powdered sugar with heavy cream and made a simple icing. So delicious!!!

A really good quick and easy recipe. Using 2 tsps. Of coconut oil in place of canola oil gives it a coconut flavor, if desired. Adding a splash of milk once it's done makes it more moist and instantly cools it down. I would definitely make this again

I followed the direction perfectly, it was very dry and  tasted and smelled weird. Also exploded in my microwave after about 45 secs. Will not be making again.

This came out great!   I used a small Pyrex bowl in case it might spill over.  No problems at all!  Was craving cake, but didn't want to spend a lot of time baking.  Perfect!

I'm honestly impressed. I made it in the spur of the moment and I didn't have vanilla extract or milk, yet it wasn't half bad. It's probably way tastier with the vanilla though. I also halved the recipe because I saw complaints here about the cake spilling, but I really think I could have cooked the full amount in my cup. I want this with extra chocolate or ice cream later!

Only thing I changed was I used almond oil because that's what I had. I doubt it made a huge difference but it was amazing. *Use a ginormous mug.* I also whipped up a little buttercream and spooned it on while it was still hot. Dangerously delish.

I was looking for a easy and tasty chocolate cake And I stumbled across this recipe instead of milk I just used water and a (very) little bit of butter and it ended up being delicious. Since our family is moving soon we have been emptying out the pantry and vegetable oil was also substituted for the conola oil. This is a yummy easy and flexible recipe I will be making again very soon.

I confess that I was skeptical...but no reason to be. I followed the recipe exactly and had delicious results!! I followed the advice of others and used a larger container One that was more of a flat glass bowl. It makes a lot for one person so find a friend to share. They'll be amazed you made it so quickly!!

Yum! This recipe made a fluffy, but rich chocolate cake. Based on some other reviews, I used a large mug and it was perfect. I made a couple of changes based on ingredients that I had.  Instead of 3 Tbls of milk,  I used 2 Tbls of Almond Milk and one of Half-and-Half.  I also add a sprinkle of cinnamon and tiny dash of cardamom. Great cake. Not too sweet but satisfied dessert craving.

Very tasty and my dad loved it! I put it with vanilla ice cream. But the one issue is the sugar, it would stick to my teeth and I could feel every piece in my mouth. Also I would say it is more of a brownie. Either way it was good and amazing. I doubled the batter and now I can make it whenever I got chocolate cravings.

I consider myself an accomplished baker and am very critical of desserts. I would never consider making this but I was having a major chocolate craving. Considering this was mixed and made in under 4 minutes, I think it was ok. Took care of the cravings but not something I would make regularly.

This is amazing. Today is my mom's birthday and unfortunately she needs to get a root canal due to a nearly rotted tooth. However, this was a good treat to have, as it was soft and sweet. We dined on these masterpieces while watching A Dog's Purpose, and it made for a wonderful birthday!

How the hell am I just trying mug cake now? 
I hacked up three squares of one of those knock off wal mart brand Lindt dark chocolate bars and served it with some left over home made salted caramel ice cream. Good for a late night snack craving. I would say it's definitely sharing sized. Good thing to whip up and eat in bed with the one you love

Add a handful of milk chocolate chips and this is the BEST thing ever.  I use a bowl instead of a mug because it makes a good amount.  I have made this about 6 times and for several people.    Everyone loves it!  Trust me you should try this one if you're a chocolate lover.

Just like any cake made in the microwave, it has a rubbery texture. Other than that, it is as expected. We did use the low cal variant and that was fine.

Does it make a nice sweet-tooth cure for one? Sure. Is it the best cake you will ever have? Absolutely not.

I just made this and it was really good!! Made as written. After cooking, I put some chocolate syrup and cookies & Cream ice cream on top. Yummy! Also, for some, you might need to adjust the microwave timing as you might have a different wattage microwave than the author of the recipe.

I liked this cake quite a lot. I did have a little bit of a problem as it did not cook all the way through. That just means that when I make it again, I'll have to cook it a little longer.

Very easy and yummy. However, next time I will half the amount of oil and cook it a little longer than the recipe says.

Was looking for a chocolatey dessert using ingredients I had in the fridge/pantry - this was perfect and so easy. Only wish I had a few scoops of vanilla ice cream to go with it!

Best microwave dessert I have eaten! Almost tastes like actual oven-baked chocolate cake! Moist and flavorful. I think adding chocolate chips is necessary for taste to be strong and not bland like other microwave desserts. Also, I used a mini glass Pyrex bowl because my regular mugs were too small.

PERFECT recipe!!   I've tried several mug cake recipes, this is the best.  Only change I made was  1T coffee instead of 1T water.   This one's a keeper.

Made exactly as written. Really delicious, and easy! Definitely need a big mug, though. Also gets really hot... it's hard to wait for it to cool down. I may have burned my stomach.

As others have noted, recipe won't fit well in a mug. I used a decent sized cereal bowl and it over halfway filled it. I think it would be better for two people (although I happily ate the whole thing!). Added a little cinnamon to mine per my taste, used buttermilk instead of regular since I had some to used up, and some big chocolate chips. Very fudgey and delicious. The chips seemed to sink to the bottom of the mixture and melted there into this very dense chocolate layer, maybe because I used the bigger chips. I'd try with normal sized or mini chocolate chips next time.  There will definitely be a next time :)

Easy and quick to make. For a higher wattage microwave, I would recommend to cook for no more than 1 minute and 30 seconds. Using the full 1:45 made it extremely dry and crumbly. I tried it with powdered sugar instead of chocolate chips.

This is really good. Easy to make and tastes pretty good. Add some chocolate or caramel sauce on top and it's even better. If you're craving cake or brownies, I'd definitely recommend this recipe. Not as good as making a batch of brownies but for a quick microwave dessert it's good.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Very quick to assemble and tasted great!!  Just note, this is quite a helping, glad I read the previous reviews that encouraged the use of an oversized mug.  Decided to use a bowl the 2nd time.

Added a little ameretto and chunks of dark chocolate/paleo from a recipe that I got from here. That made it very gooey like a molten lava cake. No need for frosting. My only personal issue is due to severe adhd it was that for one little cup it's a lot of ingredients to gather and measure and put away (i know- ridiculous but the struggle is real). I wouldn't do it again for just one. Next time I'll make up single serving dry ingredient baggies. I will make this again

This one had a lot more ingredients than most mug cake recipes, but the result was much less, sorry to say.  It didn't rise much in the mug and got thrown away by someone who will eat almost anything with chocolate in it.

I am not a chocolate cake lover but I am a chocolate lover.  I made this for my kids and the taste was very good.  Rich dark chocolate flavor and easy to make.  Both of my boys loved it and asked for it the next night.  The first one I made in a smaller mug but put a plate under it so the overflow was caught and didn't dirty my microwave.  The second one I used a wider mug and had no spillage. If you don't have a wide mouthed mug  I would recommend making in a small bowl so it doesn't bubble over.

I was really craving something fudgy but this was more heavy and floury. I added 1 tbsp. coffee and left out the chocolate on the top. That may have been the problem. Will try again the next time a chocolate craving hits and I need it fast!

Went straight by the recipe and it was pretty good.  I did add some butterscotch chips (had those on hand).  I was surprised it turned out so well.  I plan to use the recipe as a base to make different flavors; yellow cake, strawberry, choc. mint, etc.  Use a good sized mug.  Much better than having to make an entire cake when you don't want one.

Delicious!  I've tried a few mug cake recipes, and this is the best.  The only changes I made were to spray the mug with nonstick cooking spray first (easier cleanup) and to sprinkle a few chocolate chips on after baking.  It would also be good with a scoop of ice cream or a spoonful of peanut butter on top.

Made it as written. First 2 bites were great but the more you ate it, the more it taste like flour. I don't think I'll try it again.

I use this recipe all the time! Make sure you use a large mug. I like to substitute the liquids with beer (stout or porter is best) and add a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.

Totally satisfying!! I used 1/8 cup oat flour & 1/8 cup almond flour for a gluten free version. Used dark cocoa powder and added dark chocolate & mint chocolate chips. Puffed up beautifully but then sank down a little bit into the BEST ooey-gooey chocolate-y dessert!! Looking forward to making it again!!

I followed this recipe to the T without any add-ins because I was out of chocolate chips. (uh oh!) But have no fear, every other item on the list is usually a kitchen staple every woman should have! This was so yum! I made it in a large soup bowl that has a mug handle on it, but it was perfect! I would recommend something bigger than a standard coffee mug, go with a "cereal" ceramic bowel if you have one. Plastic would work fine too.

it was very good! i put a little cream on it right before i ate it but i tend to find things too dry. Next time i would use a bigger mug- i used a normal sized coffee mug and came dangerously close to making a big mess in my microwave!

Made this. I've tried a few mug cake recipes over the last year. I initially liked that this one didn't require an egg (too eggy/waste of a whole egg).
Though straightforward and fairly easy, I was not fond of the outcome. It was dense and grainy. The high amount of flour masked the chocolate a lot. 
I won't be making it again.

It  makes no mention to use a large mug or other container. I used a regular 8oz mug and it overflowed everywhere. It made a big mess and it still wasn't cooked.

I'm semi-sad to admit I have tried A LOT of chocolate cake in a mug recipes. This is definitely the best. Looks kind of wimpy when you mix it up but it puffs up to fill a large mug (USE A LARGE MUG!) Tastes great.  And I like that it doesn't require an egg.

Made this when I was craving cake and it definitely satisfied! I shaved 2 squares of baker's semi sweet chocolat in it because im a chocoholic. It wasnt as rich as an actual chocolat cake would be but was still exactly what I needed. As per other reviews, I used an oversized mig and im glad I did! :)

My 4 year old son really wanted to bake something with me, but I was running really low on supplies. This was perfect. I followed the recipe given, but I doubled it and used a large soup mug. It made enough for my son, me, and my husband. If you undercook it, you'll have a chocolate lava cake situation, which is fantastic. So easy a 4 year old can master it!

Made as written with the exception of adding 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Oh my goodness this is awesome!  I put it in large cereal bowl and microwaved for 2 minutes.  It turned out perfect with parts of it ooey-gooey like lava cake.  Will definitely be making this again.

This cake was amazing!!! My biggest tip is that when you choose the mug to cook it in, you want the batter to fill up about 1/3 to 1/2 of the mug or else it will overflow. Also, if you have chocolate chips laying around- use them! You will not regret it :)

This was the second time I have made this mug cake. Both times I have found myself with no milk. But I always keep evaporated milk in the pantry. Let me tell you, this recipe is great! I added milk chocolate chips, and drowned the top in goat's milk caramel. So fudgy and rich.

Turned out great. The only thing I changed was the addition of chocolate chips and topped it off with powered sugar.

Picked up the kids at school and they were STARVING!  So we rushed home and got out the cups, forks, measuring spoons, 1/4 cupper, and ingredients.  We all measured our own (for baking practice) and within 10 minutes we all had our own personal snack.   

Every mug-cake came out great. Some added chocolate chips, some butterscotch chunks, and some went with nothing extra.  Everyone used whipped cream :)   

The only thing I did differently was use Extra Light Olive Oil instead of canola, because it's much healthier.    I'm thinking about getting a mason jar and filling it with the dry ingredients.  A jar would great to send to my niece in her college dorm, or for the kids to take over to friends houses for stay-overs, or for rainy/freezing day playdates.

Be still my heart. YUM. I made exactly as written except added a few chocolate chips in hopes of keeping it chocolaty tasting. Mission accomplished. I cooked it in a cereal bowl for 1 min 30 seconds and it was fully cooked, moist and seriously - surprisingly - delicious. This recipe saved me from baking an entire cake and it tastes as good as any box mix this master chef (not) can mix up. It was way faster, way less messy and was simply the bomb. Great treat for kids or adults.

Ok, so I've tried one heck of a lot of mug cakes in my day. One thing the recipes never seem to agree on is how much egg it needs. Imagine my surprise when I look at the ingredients to this recipe and see NO egg! I almost didn't try it, but I am so unbelievably glad I did!

Without a doubt, this is my new go-to mug cake recipe. The cake is moist and light and just sweet enough, perfectly chocolatey.

I like to sprinkle a little confectioners sugar on top when it's done because sugar :)

As far as mug cakes go - this one is a keeper! I altered the recipe a TAD. I only used 1 tbsp of oil; and used almond milk since it's all I had. Turned out wonderful. Topped with some peanut butter and chocolate chips.

Made this for the first time last night and was awesome! I was craving a choc cake, but was lazy to get all my utensils out & wash them & waste a huge batch. Was too cold out, so didn't wanna buy any.  I needed something quick, asap. I love to bake so I was reluctant about cooking a cake in a microwave...but as soon as I saw it fluff up in there and took it out, it was still  light and fluffy! I served it with peppermint choc bark Hagan Daas icecream and was delish! Will make again for my next emergency cravings... =D

I added an egg in the ingredients, cooked it for 3 minutes, and the result was delicious. I was craving caramel chocolate, so I had it cut down to layers and filled each layer in between with whip cream and added some caramel top sauce. Anyway, I couldn't resist to eat it all.

Substituted the milk for soya milk and its vegan friendly too!

I made this in a Pyrex 2 cup  glass measuring cup and it worked perfectly. I added chocolate chips, but for everything else I followed the recipe. I love that it doesn't use eggs so my 3 year old daughter can help with every step. This is definitely not a substitute for an actual birthday cake, but if you're just craving a sweet treat you can't beat the ease of this recipe!

awesome! I followed the recipe but had to sub the milk for heavy cream because that was all I had. I also added chocolate and butterscotch morsels, a little chili powder, a little french vanilla coffee powder, and some cinnamon. It was done in 2 min 15 sec. I topped it off with some Hershey chocolate syrup. It was a great late night snack.

Omg, yes! I have searched for a decent mug cake to satisfy my sudden chocolate cake needs and this is it. I only made a few tiny adjustments, but oh man, worth it!  I subbed coffee for water and cream for milk. 
I made some cream cheese icing to go on top and it was baller.  10/10 recommended

We followed the recipe as it was and the result was wonderful! Super thick and stick to your soul chocolatey. I would definitely recommend a large mug though (all we had were large mugs so that is what we used). A normal 11oz mug may be too small and may overflow in the microwave. I will definitely be making this again. Great for any chocolate crisis!

This turned out pretty stellar. I topped mine with cut up strawberries and dusted it with powdered sugar. A little of the batter wasn't done at the bottom because I used a bigger mug, but it was perfect! I've made it a couple times now and it's super yummy, and chocolate craving satisfactory!

Hands down one of the tastiest mug cake recipes I've tried. Rich,  chocolatey, perfect balance (sometimes these have too much flour and taste a little bland). I did 1/8c of sugar instead of 1/4 and added in a handful of white chocolate chips. Paired it with a glass of milk. Mmmm mmmmm mmmmm. This IS the mug cake you've been looking for.

Used raw granulated sugar and almond milk. Next time will try applesauce. Baked in 3 very full cupcake tins  (fill almost to top, they didn't spill over) at 350 for 20 minutes.

I never leave reviews. I thought this would be too good to be true. I was totally wrong. This is amazing! Light and fluffy! I quickly caramelized some bananas with maple syrup.  This is a keeper!

Yum! I've made a microwaveable chocolate cake in a mug before, but it wasn't nearly this good! This recipe was really fabulous...fudgey, cakey, and perfect chocolate flavor without being overly rich. I made it in a jumbo cappucino mug since other reviewers said it overflowed a standard coffee mug and I switched out milk for coconut milk because I can't have dairy and it still turned out great. Other than the coconut milk, I stuck to the recipe, and threw in a handful of chocolate chips before I put it in the microwave! I ate it with non-dairy cashew milk ice cream and it satiated my chocolate cravings this cool fall evening. Thanks for sharing!

I was low on milk so I made the healthy version using applesauce and water, and doubled the recipe using a soup bowl instead of a mug. 

Cooked it for 2.5 minutes to not dry it out.


4 stars instead of 5 because I probably needed to microwave 5-10 seconds longer for less gummy texture, pretty sure will be 5 stars next time!


NOTE: instructions for healthy version need to say use applesauce ***instead of oil***. Could be confusing to some.


GREAT for a chocolate fix using what I had on hand, thank you!!

Finally!
I have tried recipe after recipe for mug cake and they all seem to use an egg. I think the egg was the downfall. 
I accidentally added an extra tablespoon of oil (I only use light olive oil in my baking) and that was to only thing I changed. I'm sure it would be just as good as written. Hubby tried mine and wanted his own and that never happens. I added a handful of chocolate chips to his as he wanted it extra chocolaty. 
This cake is the perfect thing is you love a good moist brownie.
Thank you for sharing. You cured my craving.
Oh and make sure that you make it in a bowl or very large mug like someone else suggested.  It is too much cake for a regular mug.

I needed a chocolate fix and the only chocolate I had in the house was unsweetened bakers cocoa, so this recipe saved me!
I love that it doesn't call for eggs (I'm always sketchy about undercooked eggs). I didn't have any vanilla so I used pumpkin pie spice to give it some flavor (I may try adding a little canned pumpkin next time!)
Cleanup was super fast too! I was done putting everything away in the 1 minute and 45 seconds it took to bake.

This works well! I made a cake, left it to cool and it's still edible. Good for a snack at the work desk with coffee. You can also top it with rich chocolate cream if you like. For my 2nd cake, I halved the ingredients, used a teacup and made a "cupcake" instead ^_^ ... I did, however, replace Canola oil with butter in my 2nd cake. I have extremely sensitive tastebuds and sense of smell. Canola oil smells and taste icky in sweet food... I'm going to try making it with Guinness or Baileys for my man... ^_^

This was pretty amazing. And it turned out great. Instead of using vanilla, I used almond extract and it was still to die for. Not too sweet but just right.

LUSH! I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this little mug cake was. I have never made a cake in a mug or microwave and was quite dubious about it however, this was very quick, easy, simple and delicious. I used a large mug and followed the instructions exactly and it came out brilliantly, with no overspill.  It was light, fluffy and I loved it.  I will definitely be making it again.

I've tried almost all mug cake recipes on the internet and this is the ONLY one that I'll make.  I pair it with some vanilla ice cream and caramel topping and it's truly the best 5 minute dessert I've ever had.

I made the recipe exactly as it's written down to measurements and time. Probably the best mug cake recipe I have ever come across! I have tried TONS and they're too hard, not tasty, or made in a way that you should have just baked a huge cake in the first place. This recipe has a great cake texture and it has a wonderful chocolate flavor. Most mug cakes make a full mug and this one is definitely a big mug cake. It's been added to my favorites and I will continue to use it!

This turned out great! I suck at cooking and baking but I tried this and it was super easy! I actually doubled the recipe and used a small glass mixing bowl.  After I took it out of the microwave I drizzled caramel syrup over it! Fyi I find most chocolate cakes to be rather dry and this was perfectly moist! The caramel really made this unbelievably good! Thanks for sharing this!

Original review: Can i refrigerate the mix after I've mixed it but didn't cook yet?   I   thought my child was sleeping and was just about to put the mug in the microwave when OUT he comes of his bedroom!  I quickly shoved the mug in the cabinet for now.  Darn it,  can't mom enjoy her own special treat?!?!?!   I KNOW it'll be delicious, as I tasted the batter and it was yummy!  Maybe I'll just eat that for now. LOL.
...................
Update:  I refrigerated it and it was fine the next morning and it cooked fine, no problems.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!    I will need to make this healthier and I need to cut the recipe in half so I can at least have it 300 calories.  
..................
Update 2:  I forgot to say that I doubled this recipe since it just wasn't enough for me.   I also nuked on 50% for twice as long . It comes out MUCH better and doesn't dry out.  When I did it at high power the edges got hard and it cooked too much.  Always cook lower  power for more time.    You can always cook more, but you can't take away time.   
I have an 1100 watt microwave.

So good! I added the chocolate chips like others had suggested and it made it really chocolatey. My husband and I probably would have preferred it without, but the kids liked the extra chocolate. I ran out of vanilla extract after making one mug cake so I used almond extract for the rest. YUM!

THIS IS AMAZING OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG I've made this 4 nights in a row now. The next batch will be my last for a while cause i'll be out of coco powder. This cake is so good and SO easy. It's really sweet, more like a brownie but I love it that way. Thank you so much for the recipe and completing my life.

This was delicious! I I followed the recipe and added about a tbsp of Hershey's chocolate syrup. Yum I wanted a little more of a densed gooey cake, cut the time down by 20 sec. Topped with vanilla ice cream. OMG!! 
NOTE: I have have larger coffee mugs so, the cake came up halfway, which was great, because it gave me room for the scoop of icecream

Will make again and again thanks for sharing

I followed the recipe exactly as is, it was delicious! However after it was made, I did spread a little bit of Nutella on top as a quick "icing". This recipe is a keeper!

Yummy !!! OMG, this was so good !  It quenched my late night craving for something chocolatey good.  I wanted frosting so I sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on top when it came out of the micro, they melted quickly and made a delicious "ganache". Looking forward to making it again for family and friends.

Delicious! Very moist and lots of chocolate flavor. I used one less Tbsp sugar but added a little chocolate syrup on top after baking it. I think the reason this recipe produces a lighter cake is that there isn't any egg. Eggs add structure=denser cake. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

This was amazing. I used a 16 ounce mug and it was perfect. It didn't overflow, although, I watched it rise to the rim as it was cooking, and then it settled down. The only change I did was set it for 75 seconds because I like my cakes moist. It was perfection!

I've made plenty of different mug cake recipes because my sweet tooth has no chill. I thought mug cakes were a mediocre, gimmicky way to satisfy a craving but this recipe is honestly delicious. It's v. rich and moist and chocolately. As a snob who would never ever buy boxed cake mix or even a cake from the grocery store's bakery, make this mug cake.

Out of the many mug cakes I've tried this is the absolute hands down best and I'm not even that big a fan of chocolate nor cake and I fell in love with this. 100% worth the try.

This was the easiest best tasting chocolate cake I have had in a long time.  I was looking for something small and chocolate to make and this hit the spot.  It took very little effort to make this great tasting cake.  Thank you.

This is a game changer/life saver!! Since my husband doesn't like chocolate (God have mercy on him), I rarely bake chocolatey desserts. The only problem is that...well...I freakin' LOVE chocolate!!! So this mug/bowl cake is such an amazing discovery for me! And the best part is that it's so easy. I'll be whipping one up every time I crave some chocolatey goodness--which is definitely going to ruin my diet. #sorrynotsorry.

Excellent recipe! I followed everything with the exception of canola oil and used organic coconut oil. I was craving chocolate cake and just needed a taste not a whole cake. I used a soup bowl vs. mug. I cannot wait to make again.

Perfect! Per a suggestion, I made it in a  6-inch Corningware dish and it was evenly cooked and perfectly moist. I have tried other mug recipes that came out very chewy or half-cooked. This was surprisingly fantastic.

I doubled it and made it in a big bowl so that it didn't run over and make a mess. This meant I had to up the cooking time...maybe to about 4 minutes? Anyway, I was extremely underwhelmed when I took it out and had some warm. It was like it had no flavor. I still ate about half just because I really wanted cake. Fast forward to the next day and oh my goodness!! Amazingly yummy and still very moist! I'm planning to make a double batch again and frost it! Oh! The only change I made was that I added a packet of espresso powder.

For a microwave chocolate cake this is pretty  good. It's obviously not going to taste the same as a cake baked in the oven. But it's great for those days you feel like a bit of chocolate without needing to spend an hour making a cake - plus having a whole cake in the house is just way too tempting.

This mug cake is delicious! Mine turned out more like a very cake-y brownie, which I'm fond of. I did double the recipe and divided it between a bowl and a normal sized mug, about 2/3 for the bowl and the remaining 1/3 for the mug. Even with more than half the batter in the bowl, it only took about a minute and a half to cook through. I always recommend checking the mug cake after 45 seconds and then every 15 seconds after that because in the microwave it can go from perfect to crispy pretty quickly. The normal mug nearly overflowed with less than what the normal recipe calls for, so definitely use a large/oversized mug if making according to recipe. All in all, great texture (not spongey and dry), plus that warm chocolatey flavor equal a winner in my book.

I had a craving for chocolate cake a couple of days ago but didn't want to make a whole cake.  I'd heard of mug cakes and decided to give this a try.  I made 1 small change - I substituted cold coffee for the water (it adds depth to chocolate flavour).  As 1 reviewer mentioned bubbling over, I watched as it cooked and had to stop it for a few seconds a couple of times, but it turned out perfect.   So good!  Nice texture, not too sweet, very chocolately.  I served it still warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  My hubby liked it so much, he asked me to make it again the next day.

The only thing I changed was the canola oil; I used coconut oil instead because it's healthier and has a better taste. I put powdered sugar on top and it was the most delicious chocolate mug cake I have ever tried. Even my kids love it, and they're not too crazy about chocolate (okay, well my daughter is, but not my son). They ask for it all the time. I think this is one of the best mug cake recipes out there, and it's so versatile. You can add whatever you want to it and it's just that much better.

I dropped a tablespoon of peanut butter in the center of mine for some molten goodness.

I am eating this as I type. A very good, fudgy, fast, easy treat. I didn't have any plain milk on hand, so I used chocolate milk.  I will make this again. It does bubble pretty high, but I opened the microwave door, and then let It finish cooking, and it did not bubble over.

For a quick chocolate fix, this microwave cake is the best I've had! No eggs lending to that thick mushy texture. This was delicious!  I made it in a large mug, with heavy cream instead of milk, added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips before microwave, then more on top after the 90 seconds. Oh and I drizzled a little heavy cream on the top to finish it off, so so good!

Great way to satisfy a chocolate craving! I measured the cocoa in "heaping" tablespoons, and added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Made this in a soup bowl, and I'm glad I did, because I wanted to make sure there was enough room to top with vanilla ice cream.  I think this could EASILY be split between 2 mugs.  I couldn't finish my serving (maybe because of the extra ice cream!)

To make this healthier I substituted Truvia for the white sugar, coconut oil for the canola oil, and I added sugar free Hershey's chocolate chips for fun. This was absolutely delicious!!! :)

Made it as written in an oversized mug. It is good if you need a dessert/chocolate in a hurry. When it came out of the microwave I drizzled mine with Kahlua which is not a bad thing.

For a microwave cake, it's very flavorful! I microwaved it for 1:30 rather than 1:45, which made it a little more squishy, and then filled part of it with some milk to cool it off and make a nice chocolate milk soup around it.

This cake was fabulous!  Used coconut milk since I'm not a fan of milk.  As if having moist, yummy chocolate cake within 3 minutes wasn't easy enough, I just used a 2-cup measuring cup as my mug for one less thing to have to wash.  This one's going into my favorites!

This was an excellent recipe. It it's perfect for those occasional chocolate cravings! I cooked it for 1:30 secs., then added chocolate syrup. I then cooked it for the remaining time. This made the cake extra chocolatey and moist. For a finishing touch, I spread cream cheese over the top. Yum!

The cake is excellent.  I added the extra 1Tbs of cocoa as some readers did because I love Chocolate but I wish I hadn't .   I think it made it a little bitter.  I started to decrease the sugar but the added cocoa made me use the full amount.  I added 1Tbs of chocolate chips but couldn't taste them and it didn't need them.    My husband ate his and probably 1/3 of mine.   I could have made 3 cakes instead of 2 because it almost filled a 12 oz bowl.    Next time I won't change anything.

I was having a serious chocolate cake craving, so I decided to try this recipe. I added a teaspoon of Andes mint chips on top before I popped it in the microwave, and it tastes like Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies! So yummy! Craving satisfied ??

Exactly what i was looking for! A quick, small dessert, that was easy without sacrificing taste and texture. I followed the recipe exactly, and added a handful of chocolate chips to the mix. I did place it in a smallish ceramic bowl, but a Friends worthy oversized mug would be perfect! Make it.

Moist, melt-in-your-mouth, dense, delicious. It kind of hovers between chocolate cake and chocolate pudding (in a good way). First time, I followed the directions, added some coconut flakes and a handful of chocolate chips, and it turned out great, if ridiculously decadent. Second time, I cut the sugar in half and added a handful of walnuts. This reduced the sweetness significantly, but the walnuts went spectacularly with this new version.

There is a reason we don't bake a real chocolate cake in the microwave.  With this being said, this was 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly, and served with vanilla ice cream and drizzled chocolate sauce across the top.  yummy!

I didn't make any changes to this and I loved the texture! However I suggest adding a bit of coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor and will be doing that next time! However was really impressed with the moisture of this mug cake!

I needed a chocolate fix, and this fit the bill.  I will, however, cut back on the amount of sugar the next time I make this.  I found it to be quite a bit sweeter than I would have liked.  This was the only downside for me.

For a super-quick microwave cake, this was great! I cut the recipe in half for just me. And I added a splash of mint extract and a few chocolate chips, which was awesome. The texture is good, the chocolate flavor is a little lacking but the chips helped with that. I just wish I had some vanilla ice cream to go with it!

I used a large mug- if you use a small coffee mug, it will overflow.

I mixed it really well, for about 2 minutes with a spoon then used a whisk and mixed it again for 2 minutes but when it came out there was a lump of baking soda, otherwise it was okay, but I can't say I'll make this again.
I've been trying to find a cake recipe in a mug and experienced several cakes but nothing compares to a fresh baked cake.

Great recipe for proportions. I used brown sugar and agave combo for the white sugar. Added one tablespoon of chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon egg white for 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Great consistency and flavor!  You could mix a lot of different flavors with this as a base. The best mug cake I've tasted!

Delicious. Love that it doesn't require eggs. This is the second time I made this. Even though it was very tasty, I adjusted it this time around. I halved the recipe, added chocolate chips and coconut, and threw fresh raspberries on top... YUM!

I was skeptical, but it's very good! Only had whole wheat flour, but it turned out deliciously.
