Wings came out great! A few changes: 1. Cut up the rosemary into smaller pieces and sprinkled it over all the wings. 2. Opened up the garlic and sprinkled it over all the wings. 

Then when I added the spice mixture the rosemary and garlic mixed into the wings more. I believe this gave the dish more flavor. I baked them 20 min on one side, took them out and turned them then baked another 20 minutes on the other side. 

Instead of broiling them, I grilled them one by one on the grill. They came out really well. I think the grilling really sealed in the flavor. 

Thanks for the recipe!

I modified the recipe a bit since I did not have lemon pepper. I used the juice of one lemon instead and was surprised of how much flavor the wings had. My hubby loves bbq sauce and smothers everything in it. This was the first time he decided to eat the wings as is. Great recipe!

Great wings! I tossed the wings in olive oil, rosemary,  lemon zest, salt and pepper with 2 crushed cloves of garlic.  Baking and then broiling for crispiness is key.  I topped the wings with caramelized yellow onion for a touch of sweetness.

Didn't have much flavor to be honest.  Are you suppose to place the rosemary on the chicken or just bake it along the side?  Probably won't make again.

I forgot to check if I had lemon pepper before making this. So I used the zest of 2 lemons and the juice of one. I also minced one sprig of the rosemary so that some of it would stick to the chicken. I think it came out pretty good. Everyone else seemed to like it.

I've made these twice now and they continue to be awesome. Great healthy way to eat wings since they are baked and not fried... also a good alternative for family members who don't like hot wings.  
Great recipe for family holiday parties or groups.

This was okay, but surprisingly bland. Because the sauce was so aromatic, I expected the wings to have a lot more flavor. Maybe if the skin was removed and the wings were marinated in the sauce first? I don't know. Just not as good as I expected...

I did add chopped garlic and sliced onions when baking them. They added a great flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Would definitely make them again, and again!

Very good flavor but the cooking time is a little long.  They would have been pretty dry with the addition of the broil time as well.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
