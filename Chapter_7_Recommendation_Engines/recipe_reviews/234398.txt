Wow these onions were good! The perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and savory.  I made them for hot dogs and they took the hot dogs to a whole other level of deliciousness. I pretty much followed the recipe except I did not add the last tbsp of butter at the end. I thought that was just overkill and I didn't miss it at all. I was a little bit leery of putting a whole habanero because habaneros are no joke when it comes to being hot. I just put a smallish one and it was perfect. These onions would also be perfect on hamburgers. Make sure you don't slice the onions too thin because they'll dry out and be tough. You want nice strips so that they will caramelize well. Thanks for posting this Doug and my tummy thanks you too!

You can never have too much butter or caramelization when making sauteed onions and these Sweet Habanero Onions love both.

Awesome!!  After years on this site this is my first review, I was compelled by how delicious this is and the fact nobody else (other than the author) has reviewed this yet... word of this secret deliciousness needs to spread.  My wife, who hates onions...I made her try a bite and soon she was eating up my onions off my plate.  Thank you for this recipe, very easy and so delicious! (Yes Habaneros are hot, but their actual flavor is oh so good).  Thank you!

I made this just as the recipe called for, and OH MY GOODNESS IT WAS DELICIOUS. My man keeps asking me when I’m gonna make it again. It isn’t too spicy to tolerate but it will definitely make your head sweat. Definitely something for the spicy lover. Ate ours as a topping for a filet. It was so good you could almost eat it like candy.

Made as directed.  Used 2 green habanero.  They lost their floral quality during the long caramelizing of the onions.  Next time I'll add another pepper halfway through the cooking of the onions.

These were awesome! I will never make a hotdog without making these onions to pile on top. Though I didn't add more butter at the end I'm sure these are good as written, but I didn't miss the additional butter. Also, I don't think the one habareno added enough spice. 

After tasting the finishing product, I opted to add one more habanero. This time I left the seeds in and it added a nice kick. Sadly, I only bought two habaneros. I wish I had at least two more to dice up and toss in.

I used jalapeno peppers, but followed the recipe otherwise and used the onion to top cheddar jalapeno burgers with a jalapeno tomatilo mayo.  So perfect with the pop of sweet from the onion and the bit of vinegar from the mayo and three levels of jalapenos in the middle.

These are delicious. Not very hard to make, just have to be patient on the low heat. The heat from the habanero is pretty subtle. Which was good for the first time, but I may add another half a habanero next time. Good lookin on the recipe.
