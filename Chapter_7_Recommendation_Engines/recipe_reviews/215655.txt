Weird. Someone changed my review.  The directions here are incomplete.  The squares NEED TO BE DIVIDED IN HALF FIRST then pressed into the center.  There is no need for shortening.  Be prepared to waste a lot of money on the dough like I did to get this right, if it can be done at all.  Also, this is really sweet.

My mom used to make this recipe but instead of putting chocolate chips in the middle, she would use mini reeses peanut butter cups. You put them in right after the cookies come out of the oven.

I'm still amazed that people still use plastics in microwaves, hmmm!  Please take the time to melt the chocolate on the stove top. Other than that these are great. Thanks for the half a square tip from one of the other reviewers.

Ok, I really only used this recipe as a general suggestion. I made my own chocolate chip cookie dough following the recipe on the back of the Nestle chip bag (used mini chips). Put one scoop of dough into each muffin cup. Instead of using the melted chocolate, I used Hershey Drops (like extra large M&Ms without the candy coating) for half the batch and the super mini-peanut butter cups (they come in a small bag, like the Drops, and have no paper on them) for the other half. Places these candies in the center of the dough and baked. They were AWESOME. The pb cup ones were the overwhelming favorites, though. Really easy to make and quite a hit!

I'm an RA and I made these for my residents at a floor meeting.  They loved it! ..and me for making them :)   You have to play this recipe by ear.  I know that a previous reviewer said to only use half a square, but I found that using one square worked just fine.  I was careful to make a very deep groove before I baked the cups and then after a few minutes of them coming out of the oven I poked them down a bit so when they cooled their groove was nice and deep for the melted chocolate.

So I sent my husband to the store on Christmas Eve with a coupon for 3 tubes of crescent rolls. He returned with...3 packages of refrigerated cookie dough and he STILL had the coupon. So, I improvised. I used this basic idea for a pie, using refrigerated cookie dough that I fully baked as a pie crust, then added melted chocolate chips in the ratio of 2 cups chips melted into 1 can sweetened condensed milk (to make a softer filling, suitable for pie). It turned out super rich to the point where I can't eat it, but the chocoholics in my life thought it was great. I think if I made it again I'd have to find a way to add a peanut butter layer to cut the strong flavor of chocolate, because it was just too much for me. Thanks for the recipe!

it was very easy to make. I didn't use my finger to make the well. I put a whole square in the mini cupcake tin and right after they came out of the over, I used a teaspoon measuring spoon to push in the center to create the well. Didn't have to get messy finger that way.

Use the whole pieces. When making the "well" use your index finger to make the hole in the middle. Half way through baking use the end of a spoon to push the cookie dough back down (it will rise when baking). When done you will need to use the spoon again to keep the hole open for the chocolate. Melt chocolate in glass bowl in microwave, works just fine that way.   They were great!!!

Loved the cookie cups, but I pushed a mini Reeses Peanut Butter cup in them right out of the oven.  I'm thinking that an adult cookie cup filled with a Kahlua or Bailey's Irish Cream mixture might be fun and tasty too.

I have made these for many bridal showers, including my own. They are always a big hit. After some testing, I have found that the mini cookie dough packets work best. They make them the perfect one bite size. I also use hot fudge ice cream topping. They seem to go over bettehr than the regular milk chocolate.

these were really good but didn't look at all like the picture.  my cookies flattened way out after baking them.  Next time I make them, I'm going to use a muffin pan.

The morsels became stickier and messier than the picture, so it came out more in lumps than like rich silk. But maybe it's me. Looks aren't everything, they tasted delicious.

Very good and very rich. Easy enough for a beginner and it took no time at all. I used peanut butter cups instead of the chips.

Loved these cookies. they are so simple but very good! Target has mini break away cookies which I used and they worked just fine. I also accidentally used semi sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate and they were still really good!
