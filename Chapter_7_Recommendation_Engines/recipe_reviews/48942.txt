LOL  I had to laugh at the reviewer who said that kids don't like vanilla extract.  They obviously haven't met my 3-year-old who goes nuts over the stuff!
At any rate, this is a great recipe.  The half and half really makes this shake smoothe and creamy.  We added a few strawberries and bananas for another version and it turned out just as good!  
Thanks for the recipe!

This was very creamy!  Next time, I might add a tiny bit of vanilla bean instead of extract. All around good recipe, though.  The use of half and half makes it much richer than most milkshake recipes I've tried so far.

Classic recipe! Smooth, rich, and creamy - definitely worthy of the last of my Haagen Daz ice cream.  I did make mine a little thicker by using less half and half.  Just like with any other recipe adjust to your tastes and you'll be sure to enjoy this cold delicious treat.

This was DELICOUS!  I used Vanilla Bean ice cream, as it's my families favorite, and I had it on hand.  I agree, the half and half really gives this a creamy, smooth texture.  I have four kids, six and under, and the three oldest did not have an issue with the vanilla extract.  We will definately be making this again.

Back when I was a kid, back in B.C. [ha ha], My cousin and I used to put the ice cream and vanilla extract & 1/2 & 1/2 in a glass and just stir until ready to spoon out. I still love to do this. As you stir it, you get it thick, and toward the end, thin enough to drink. It is still one of my favorite ways to have a shake. Sometimes we would add malt to it. SUPER. Thanks so much.

I didn't care for this milkshake that much. It turned out very thin. Instead of using 1 cup of half-and-half, I used 1/2 a cup which made it a lot more thicker.

Good but not great. And yea it was really thin. Maybe some corn starch would help? (hehehehe just kidding).
