I give it 5 stars for the concept, but I changed it a lot.

I used half cheddar and half velveeta for the cheeses to keep it from being oily from all cheddar. I also only used 4 tbsp of butter, and a splash of white wine instead of cooking sherry. I cooked the sauce on the stove so I could control the heat, and I added in some pepper as well. 

I used gluten free breadcrumbs in lieu of cornflakes. It turned out amazing! The wine was essential, it wouldn't have tasted nearly as good without it.

The cheese sauce was really soupy and was not thick enough.  The cheddar made it real oily.  I would recommend using American Cheese.

I added onions to the potatoes while they were cooking. I added sour cream, chives and garlic to the cheese sauce and it was absolutely delicious. My husband and a friend of ours loved this recipe. It will be used over and over.

Extremely satifying when you substitute white wine for the sherry and Ritz crackers for the cornflakes as suggested by other reviewers.

This was very good.  I changed the nutrition information considerably by using only 4 ounces shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup cornflake crumbs.  It was healthier --but the taste didn't suffer, and the health conscious can still enjoy!

Great tasting recipe... I did make a few changes before getting started. Added two chopped scallions and cut the butter to 1/4 cup. I used american cheese instead of the cheddar and added just a little more sherry. The results were very tasty. Thank you.

Very tasty!  I served it as a side with the Key West Chicken (also found at this site, though I substituted pork loin slices to great success) to friends and we all raved.  However, instead of using boiled potatoes I fixed them in the French persillee manner: microwave potato chunks 15 minutes in a can of beef broth or consomme', a dash of salt and a dash of pepper, slices of butter to taste, and about three tablespoons of chopped parsley.  (These potatoes are good in themselves, but when used to make the scalloped potatoes you have a very fine dish indeed!)

Great easy recipe. Like many others I added some american cheese to the mix. Also, added garlic and used plain tortilla chips (crushed of course) instead of corn flakes. The white wine or sherry makes a huge difference. One last addition, I added diced bacon to the mix. All said, the base recipe is awesome and makes it easy to add and tweak to your interests!

Really good scalloped potatoes recipe!  The entire family enjoyed this, there were no leftovers.  

I did make a couple minor modifications.  I only used 3/4 of a cup of butter, because that was all I had. Instead of using cornflakes I used panko bread crumbs and I mixed parmesan and shredded mozzarella in with the breadcrumbs.  Lastly, I added aprox 2 cups of chopped smoked ham steak.

This was a pretty good recipe, nice flavor and very simple to put together.  I would suggest melting butter with cheese(s) and milk over the stove instead of the microwave.  Microwave could cause splatter and the cheese to crust a little at the edges.  I think this recipe would do well with some onions as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for this recipe, I absolutely love it. I've made this dish numerous times and it comes out amazing every time. I did use the sherry as suggested in the original recipe and it's delicious. I did however make a couple modifications which I feel make it even tastier. I use heavy cream instead of milk. This makes the consistency much thicker, but obviously if you're being health conscious this is not the way to go. Also, instead of cheddar, I use a bag of Mexican three cheese blend. As another reviewer stated, I would also suggest the melting of the butter and the cheese to be done over the stove. This dish is so delicious and easy to prepare I will definitely make it again. Thank you!

This is a really easy recipe and both my wife and I really liked it. We both had seconds.  I did scale down the recipe for two and added some chopped up onions before putting in the oven.  I forgot to add the sherry but it was still really good. I may have boiled the potatoes a bit longer than I should have but I think this may have been one of the things I liked about this.  The corn flakes toping was a great idea.

Cheese sauce in a microwave??? Way too soupy (probably because there is no flour for the roux). Also needs onion to be true scalloped potatoes. Pre- cooking the potatoes made the whole thing way too mushy for my taste.

I did not add the sherry, because I didn't have it on hand, but it didn't need it.  These were very good.  I did put Ritz crackers on top per other reviews and did not like it.  I think it would be better with cornflakes.  My picky 2-year old ate them up.  I will make these again.

made this last night for my boyfriend and family. they really did enjoy this dish! a little more work than the variety of instant potatoes offered at the grocery store, but nothing beats meals from scratch. the only recommendation i could give would be to add more cheese, and if another type of cheese is preferred, go for it! other than that... it was very good. would make again!!!

Not bad...I didn't use Sherry in this recipe.  And I also changed the corn-flake crumbs to Ritz crumbs (place crackers in sealable bag and have-at-em with a rolling pin!)  I'd think that the cereal would be a bit on the sweeter side(??) where the Ritz added a nice salty taste.  I used the only chedder cheese that I could find at my regular Japan grocery store! (at least I found some!!!)

This is a pretty basic dish, and it was easy to make.  

Instead of cornflake cereal crumbs, we used Italian Bread Crumbs because it was the only thing we had in stock.

The bread crumbs didn't really mix well with the potatoes, it just sat on top of it like sand.  

Also, if I were to make this dish again, I would probably add more cheese.

I made this dish for our Xmas Eve office dinner and everyone LOVED it!  The only changes I made was heating the milk, butter, and cheese on the stove.  I also added 1 teaspoon of Fox Point seasoning (from Penzeys Spice).  I also used new red potatoes.  The flavor was great!

I liked this recipe, though I cooked it backwards: I accelerated the sliced pototoes in the 9"x9" pan in the microwave and did the cheese sauce on the stovetop.  I reduced the butter a little, and did not use corn flake crumbs.  My sauce was not too soupy.  I found I could pour off the excess oil from the cheese without much issue.  I would try adding some garlic and perhaps some worcestershire sauce to it next time.

I tried this recipe and loved it! However, I made a few changes to it and added a tsp of ceyenne pepper for a little kick and left out the sherry. I also added some thinly sliced onions. I love what the cornflakes do for the dish, although my husband wasn't too thrilled with the crunch. I would definitely make this one again.

Good recipe; the sherry makes it a nice variation from the typical recipe. I like the suggestion to boil the potatoes first; this saves a lot of baking time, particularly if you use a pressure cooker for 7 minute cooking of the potatoes. As others have pointed out, the sauce is way too thin.  I discovered this before I combined the sauce with the potatoes, so it was an easy fix to make a roux and add the hot watery sauce before baking.  I also reduced the saturated fat by using a mix of butter and olive oil (50-50) in the sauce, along with 100% olive oil for the roux.  My only other minor adjustment was to top with a bread crumb/ground almond mix in place of the cornflakes.  The nuts may sound strange, but the result works!

This was very good.  My modifications were: cheese soup, a little mexican cheese, milk and some roasted garlic. I used panko bread crumbs because I didn't have cornflakes. My husband and two kids loved it.

Instead of the microwave I made the cheese sauce over the stove and I left the sherry out.  Making a stove top cheese sauce was not very time consuming.  I also cut calories by using 1% milk and reduced fat cheddar. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of cereal crumbs. It still made a wonderfully cheesy and tasty scalloped potatoes dish.

Loved them with some cubed ham thrown it. Complete entree of that was done in 20 minutes in the oven!

I followed the recipe pretty closely and the potatoes were delicious! I didn't have any sherry or wine in the house so I used a few glugs of lager....tasty. Instead of baking in a glass dish I put the whole mixture in my cast iron and baked in that resulting in a crispy cheese crust around the edges. Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry, I did not care for this.  In fact, I didn't want to finish what I made and gave the rest to my brother (who will eat almost  anything but rarely gets anything home-cooked).  It's not for any of the negative reasons already stated.  There was just some flavor I didn't like and cannot pinpoint.  I thought perhaps it was the crumb topping.  But since 3 out of 4 5-star ratings are from people who left out the sherry or used white wine instead, I'm wondering if it was the "hint" of sherry.

My husband is a very picky eater and loved this. I added diced ham and used cheddar cheese instead of American. I didn't use any sherry, but I will when I make this again.

Can you say COMFORT FOOD!! I could have eaten the whole batch of it. I didn't have sherry on hand so omitted that, and I usd american cheese instead of cheddar. I also did not have corn flakes so I used bread crumbs. The kids even had seconds!

I made this for Christmas dinner and I was embarassed to serve it, even if only to my family. It was an oily, lumpy, soupy, greasy mess. The potatoes were cooked, and that was about the only good part about it all. I will never use this recipe again.

I made a half recipe for 2 of us. The “all cheddar” made the potatoes greasy. I’d mix cheeses next time. Also, I’d reduce the cooking time for the potatoes as they were pretty mushy. But, with tweaks, I’d make it again.

The only changes I made were velveeta instead of cheddar and fried onions instead of corn flakes. The taste was great, but the sauce was too loose. I'll cut the milk in half next time.

This dish turned out very thin and runny - not what I call scalloped potatoes at all.  If I made it again, I would add flour to the mix to thicken it up.  The taste was fine, it is only the texture that ruined it for us.

Good recipe! This was my first time using a cornflake topping and I liked it! I would make this again.

this was great, my boyfriend really liked it.  i was trying to use up the rest of my coconut milk so i used that instead of regular milk and also cut the butter by half as suggested by other reviewers and used half cheddar cheese and half gouda. I used white wine instead of sherry (i didn't have sherry and it was suggested by some to substitute wine).  i also put some extra mixed cheese on top before the cornflake crumbs (my boyfriend really like the baked cheese thing ;-) )  and it was great!  pic
