I've made this using fish - either grilled yellowtail or yellow fin tuna. My family and I love it!

I had to use dried dill but otherwise followed the recipe using Just Chicken from Trader Joe's.  The only thing I'd do differently would be to use less yogurt---at least to start with and then add what you think is needed.  What a great way to use leftover chicken!  We had a nice dinner!  Thanks!
