Our family loves this meal. My husband even asks me to make it! Itâ€™s going in our recipes book for our family. I make it just as it says to and comes out yummy. Will have to try it with tomatoes or olives...

An absolutely great mid week meal, have made this with assorted proteins from ground pork, venison, turkey, beef and elk. Added just the skin of tomatoes diced, included olives and cilantro. Spiced level can be adjusted to suit your taste.
