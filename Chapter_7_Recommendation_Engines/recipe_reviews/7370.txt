The "cake" part was good however the crumb topping needs much improvement. More butter is needed (which I melted instead of crumbled) and I used light brown sugar instead of the white. Be sure to add the cinnamon to taste. (we enjoy a lot more) Also a nice sprinkling of confectioners sugar over the top once it's cooled adds a nice touch.

This cake is delicious. After reading the one review about not enough crumbs I kept out an extra 1/4 cup for crumbs. It is moist and am proud to say after 40 years I finally have a perfect Crumb Cake Recipe!! Thank you!!

The cake part was too much with not enough crumbs. However slight adjustments would produce a great crumb cake. The cake portion was moist and flavorful. My husband loved it with the adjustments!

I was not impressed with this crumb cake at all. This is not your typical idea of a crumb cake. It was more like a Shortbread cake. Although it was tasty I couldn't bring myself to not add cinnamon - which was how this recipe was written. I would also take up the advice of other reviewers and double the amount of crumb mixture as 1/2 cup was not nearly enough. Overall I would say this cake could be used as a good base with different toppings and the like but not an excellent crumb case in iteself.

pretty good but it didn't taste much like the crumb cakes i'd had before. i made this for a party in my 12th grade english class once we finished our huge research paper. definately no complaints from that crowd (or the teacher).

Other reviewers are correct when they say this cake does not taste or have the texture of a crumb cake. Crumb cakes are nearly always made with buttermilk and baking soda. If you can find a similar recipe and make the adjustments I think you will find a huge difference

This was a great cake! I did make a lot of changes though not many were necessary just a matter of I didnt have the right ingredients. I used 3 cups self-rising flour instead of all-purpose and omitted the baking power. Self rising flour contains 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt per cup so I also thought about omitting an egg.....and it worked! I only had 2 eggs on hand so I splashed sommore milk in there. I used another tsp of butter with the shortening that I added only to the crumbs. I also added a little cinomman/ sugar mixture to the crumb and a little less to the cake. I only added enough for a hint of flavor to tie it all together do not make cinomman the main flavor. Overall great and easy.

This was ok. The batter was really runny and the crumb topping just sunk into the cake. It did have good flavor but I like more of a crumb topping.

After reading other reviews I modified mine before trying the original as-is recipe. However I added fruit which I didn't see anyone else mention... I used 1.5 C butter instead of shortening for my crumble topping I added a TB of cinnamon to the cake mixture I cut the milk in half and the moisture was replaced when I added 3 C apples. I also kept 3/4 C of the crumble aside. Made it twice LOVED it. Forgot pictures the first time here it is second time before baking.;)
