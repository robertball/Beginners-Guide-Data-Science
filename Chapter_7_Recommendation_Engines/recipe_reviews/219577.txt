LOVE IT!  I added mushrooms, roma tomatoes and garlic salt to taste.  I also added two cloves of fresh pressed garlic to the onion as it cooked.  I doubled the chicken broth, spinach and fettuccine so I had extra left over, and added Wonder Flour to thicken up the sauce a bit and it turned out wonderful!  There was no need to double the pesto.

This was delicious! As i was eating it, i decided that next time i will add mushrooms. Also, i used a 6.7 oz jar of pesto and it still seemed to have too much of a pesto taste. Next time I will back it off a little. Besides that, It was great! Definitely something we will have again!

This is a very easy recipe but quite tasty. I added the pesto slowly to my taste as well. I didn't want it to overpower the dish. I think adding fresh tomatoes would have been a good addition.

Amazing!!!  It tasted like something I would expect to get at a great Italian restaurant!  My 5 year old loved it, too!  The only change I made was that I used just a little over 3/4 of the jar of pesto.

Made per recipe, I'll give this three stars.  However, this has potential, so I will definitely try again adding more flavor (fresh garlic, pepper, perhaps).

Changed it a bit by using more spinach and less pasta. Next time would add mushrooms. Good flavor

I added 3 fresh garlic cloves finely chopped to the recipe (mixed with the onions). I am not so sure it would be good without garlic. I also added frozen spinach because I didn't have fresh. Overall the recipe was good. We topped it with parmesan- it's also good with a sprinkle crushed red pepper if you like it spicy!

This recipe definitely has potential!  I would season the chicken prior to cooking - I added 2 Roma tomatoes & mushrooms-be sure to use a high quality pesto to obtain the most flavor - I will cook off most of the liquid next time-definitely worth making again with a few changes

This is a good, easy recipe.  I added fresh mushrooms and although it tasted good, they combined with the pesto to make an unappealing color.  I wouldn’t recommend mushrooms if serving guests.

This was a very easy and flavorful dish! My only additions were mushrooms and freshly minced garlic. If you’re looking for a quick one skillet dinner, this is absolutely perfect! I will definitely be making it again.

I made this tonight for my husband. I didn’t change anything except I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. My husband said he could eat the pasta alone, it sucked up all the succulent juices?? Next time I may add some of the suggestions in the reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I forgot the Parmesan and didn’t miss it. I added four Roma tomatoes. It was good but my 8 year old didn’t like the spinach.

I added garlic with the onions. I also added salt pepper and crushed red peppers for spice. It would have been 5 stars if this was added to the recipe

So good, and so easy!  Only changes I made were: I pounded the chicken cutlets, and salt & peppered them before I browned them.  In addition to the chopped onion, I also used some chopped shallots and garlic.  I reduced the amount of pesto, and added a bit more chicken broth.  I also added cut up grape tomatoes with the spinach.  YUM.  One note: I used fresh fettuccine, and it became a bit mushy in the skillet.  I will use dry fettuccine next time.  LOVED IT!!

Absolutely LOVE this dish!!!!   Was a huge hit with the family!  The only thing different I did was add mushrooms.  Also, because my chicken breasts were a bit thicker, I finished cooking them in the oven then added them in the skillet at the end for 5 minutes.

Good recipe. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and added sun dried tomatoes. I also halved the pesto because I have heartburn issues, but I think it would work just as well with the full amount of pesto. The chicken was moist and tasty. I'm planning to make this again soon.

This was great! We love pesto so added a little more. Added fresh bell pepper and chopped tomato as another reviewer suggested and 3 cloves of fresh garlic chopped. This was as good as something at Macaroni Grill!
