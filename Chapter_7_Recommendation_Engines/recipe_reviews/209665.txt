Loooooved this!  Found myself with fresh limes and shrimp and of course garlic (an Italian thing) so decided to tackle it.  Have got to say that if you have delicate taste buds you may not like it, but I love robust flavors so it fits my tastes.  Followed the recipe close but when it came to arranging it on  Spanish rice- no urge there so used it as a  topping for baked potatoes and to keep the tomato in it tossed in a small handful of grape tomatoes that I split and saut√©ed in pepper  oil.  This is a dish you have to make your own, but when you do,  it will be something to come back to again and again.

Loved the shrimp, but I did change it a bit. I added garlic olive oil to the marinade and a little lime fajita seasoning. YUM. I also added some cilantro to the sour cream and made Mexican Rice II from this site. My 5 year old asked for seconds.

I marinaded the shrimp even longer that the recipe called for and the lime flavor was not there. Squeezing lime over the cooked shrimp would be far more effective without the marinade. The sauce however was very good. I adjusted the amount of hot sauce and grated lime to our taste buds. Thank You for Sharing

My only complaint about this recipe.  It should call for double the ingredients because I want more!  It is delicious.  I was afraid it would be too spicy, but it's not.  It's perfect, quick, and easy.  I'm especially happy because it doesn't require turning on my oven - just a short time using the stove top.  I'm usually not a fan of sour cream, but that tasted awesome too.  If you love shrimp, try this recipe.

I really liked this but i also changed it up a bit.  I added asparagus with plain minute rice with the other ingredients and my husband loved it. the garlic flavored and lime came through just enough and we had it as a side dish with a steak. No need for the sour cream mixture but it was delicious !! !!

Followed recipe exactly,except I made my own rice using the Spanish rice recipe from Amy Swenson.  Loved the flavors in both,the sour cream really makes it come together.
