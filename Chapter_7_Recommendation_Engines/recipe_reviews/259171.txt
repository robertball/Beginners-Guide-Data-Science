This soup is amazing! I used celery root instead of celery and pinto beans instead of great northern because that's what I had on hand. Definitely making this again!

In the future I would half the salt. I added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and it added a nice flavor. Easy, delicious recipe.

I added 2/3 cup of white wine because I didn't have enough stock. I didn't have hot sausage so I added a heaping 1/4 tsp of hot pepper flakes. And Parmesan cheese on top. I just kept eating. That is a great mix of flavors.
