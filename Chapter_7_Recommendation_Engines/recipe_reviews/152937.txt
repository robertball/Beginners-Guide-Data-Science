I am a huge lover of Ethiopian dishes! What is missing from this recipe is 2 teaspoons minced garlic and 1/2 tsp minced ginger ;-) I liked that you added cumin for a taste twist but it's really not necessary. The turmeric definitely needs to be doubled, or more to taste. Oh, and definitely reduce the oil to 1/4 cup. Oh, one more thing ... It's much easier and you'll have more control if you cook this in a large pot rather than a skillet ;-)

Ethiopian is probably my favorite kind of food, but I'd never tried making any real dishes (I live in the DC area where Ethio restaurants are all over). The restaurants call this dish tikil gomen. I have to say this tasted almost exactly like the tikil gomen I've had before--this is probably partially because I doubled the spices (as recommended) and also used niter kibbeh, Ethiopian spiced clarified butter, instead of olive oil. (There are many various recipes for niter kibbeh online--it's really flavorful and keeps for months!) I was just looking for something to make with cabbage and potatoes, but I'm glad I found this because it inspired me to make an Ethiopian dinner with Ethiopian lentils (mesir wat). This dish turned out much better than the lentils! Definitely a keeper!

This was a great new flavor for cabbage.  YES! Double the spices! I did not have tumeric so to get that sweet spicy flavor, I used balsamic vinegar.  It was great.

Cut the olive oil in half (1/4 cup) and doubled the spices (but not the salt).  Was really good!

I have three daughters from Ethiopia, and this is the first recipe they said Ive got right! It is perfect! Very close to what you would get in an authenic ET restaurant! We make this in double batches once or twice a week! Thanks!!

Very good!  My husband's first words when finished with dinner was - you can make this again!  Followed advice of others and doubled the spices.  I used my Vidalia Chop Wizard to dice the onions, carrots and potatoes so prep time was very quick.  As we are vegetarians, next time will add garbanzo beans for a protein.  Ate this with Injera Bread - very tasty!

I sooo looked forward to making this all week long! I cook in iron so maybe that had something to do with it. At first, felt like it was too soft but after eating it and savoring the oil with the cabbage, I liked it.  As stated in previous review, not alot of taste so I added more. Also, I had a wee problem with temp. as I have an electric stove. I absolutely love all ingredients in this so I'll try, try again! :0)I like my potatoes crispy on the outside and soft on the inside so next time I'll do these seperate and will add at the end. I enjoyed making it and seeing the wonderful color come to light from the Tumeric. I will keep trying! :0)

I absolutely LOVE this!  It's one of those super-comfort dishes that will become a family staple, I'm sure. Because I had some, I added a few slices (diced) of Morningstar Smart "Bacon".  We'll have the leftovers with scrambled eggs.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did read the reviews and took some suggestions.  Reviewers said 1/2 cup oil was too much so I started with 1/4 but had to add extra.  Mine started to stick.  Maybe they used non-stick pan & I used stainless dutch oven.  I doubled all the spices as suggested except salt (1t pepper, 1t cumin, 1/2t turmeric.  Some reviews said the potatoes didn't get done so they added them at the beginning.  I did that plus I used red potatoes which cook faster.  I shredded the carrots for faster cooking too and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I cooked carrots, onions, garlic & potatoes for 5 minutes.  Added the spices & cabbage and cooked COVERED for 25 min. stirring occasionally.  It was excellent.  I put in 1/2 lb. of kielbassa toward the end but next time will serve with ham or pork chops.  That would be EXCELLENT.  Thank you for a wonderful and different recipe.

I was looking for an original way to cook cabbage and found this recipe. We thought it was very good, especially when reheated the next day. Definitely double the spices for more taste, though!

This recipe is so flavorful even though there are only 4 spices in it!  I will change the cooking order of the ingredients next time since the cabbage and carrots were like mush by the time the potatoes were cooked through.  Next time I will start the potatoes, carrots and onions first and follow with the cabbage.  Definitely a tasty recipe though!

I thought this was delicious, but there was a little too much oil for me. I will try it again with a little less oil or something. Otherwise, very good and easy to make.

Yummy! I love cabbage and was looking for a new, creative way to prepare the dish.  I think I've found it!  I didn't have any tumeric or cumin so I used curry powder instead and added til it suited my taste.  I've had it wrapped in tortillas and alongside brown rice...and its yummy all around!

WOW - this will be one of our "new" favorite one-dish meals !  It was great - as usual, I used this recipe to create a version for us.  I get a kick out of people who get angry that we rate something completely different from what's presented - I think that's the fun of cooking - everyone has their own likes and dislikes and I love to hear what works or doesn't.  When I read this I quickly imagined sausage with it and then read how others added it as well.
I did double the seasoning as suggested and added chopped garlic, a stalk of celery, and some garlic pepper !
Also, I started with cooking the potatoes and then the other veggies after 10 min. or so.  
I think if you've been cooking for a good number of years you just have a 6th sense about what works and how to make it work !  AMEN

Very good!  I'm always looking for easy to make flavourful recipes minus the meat.  Definitely double the spices except the salt and I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder as well.  Will make this often!

I'm laughing at the title of "Ethiopian Cabbage Dish!"  My Grammy used to chop and fry up whatever root veggies were left over from the traditional Sunday roast dinner.  Throw in some turnips, onions, and some butter and you'll be in heaven!  (We're from Indiana.....not Ethiopia!)  Just an 'aside' - if one ever suffered from...you'll no longer suffer from constipation!

I served this with some smoked sausage and we loved every bite. The yellow color the turmeric made it was odd to get used to at first but not for long because it was delish. Thank you stamarex!

I really liked this recipe. I followed the suggestions from the other reviewers and increased the amount of turmeric and reduced the amount of cumin. I also did what one reviewer suggested and added about 1/2 tsp of ginger. I reduced the amount of oil used to about 1/8 C and cooked this in a large pot. Finally, I substituted purple potatoes for regular potatoes. This produced a refreshing dish that was slightly sweet and perfect for a hot summer day. Needless to say, I will definitely make this again.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious! I think I'll use a little less oil next time, but still super tasty. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and doubled up on the spices. Can't wait to have this again!

This dish is so easy and absolutely fantastic!  We like to brown the potatoes a bit first, double the spices, except salt, and sometimes use a couple of yams in place of regular potatoes.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I'm from Eritrea & my mother grew up in Ethiopia.  This is the most accurate & authentic recipe I've found.  As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the spice & reduced the oil as well.  FYI - Ethiopians use a lot of oil b/c most don't have non stick pans so they're in the habit of poring on the oil.

Made this dish for dinner last night, and it was wonderful!  It's really easier than the original recipe states.  First, I only used enough olive oil (2 tbsp.) to sautee the onion and carrots until soft. I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic at this point and doubled the spices.  After that I just dumped in the potatoes and cabbage, drizzled a little olive oil over all, covered and cooked for 30 minutes.  I used my Dutch oven instead of a skillet because of the volume. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my kitchen!

I was having a cabbage need and ran into this recipe.  GREAT!  So simple yet really flavorful (doubled the spices, except salt, as recommended by other viewers).  Even the hubby liked it (had his as a side dish with grilled sausage).  My first try at Ethiopian and it was a good one!

This was absolutely fantastic!  Everyone was raving about throughout dinner - my daughter took one bite then finished it off before she touched the rest of her plate!  This will definitely be part of our regular side dishes.  I used 3 tablespoons of olive oil and doubled spices, except salt, as previously suggested.  It was perfect!

I have cooked this about 4-5 times now and LOVE it - although I have made changes along the way to make it perfect for us.
They are -
+ Slightly pre-cook chunks of potato in the microwave first until a little bit cooked (about 3 or 4 mins?)
+ Add the potatoes to the (non-stick) pan FIRST and brown a little in the oil (using less oil). Then add carrot, onion,  1 tspn tumeric, 1 tspn cumin but normal salt/pepper AND at least 2 cloves of crushed GARLIC. 
+ I then add a finely sliced CHORIZO (I know - totally non-Ethiopian style but so yummy) 
+ Then the cabbage, I only use 1/4 of a head - cook approx 10>15 mins or until potato soft
+ I stir in some pre-cooked couscous (1/3 cup couscous to 1/3 cup boiling water plus a knob of butter)
The results are super YUM.

Very bland even after doubling the spices.  It needs something, but I can't figure out quite what it is.  My potatoes took longer to cook even though they were small cubes.  I think if I make it again I'll cook the carrots, then add spices and rest of ingredients together.  I put the leftovers in the frig and this recipe is GREAT cold.

I made this tonight and it was an immediate hit with the whole family. I will definitely be making it again often! I was out of onions so I used onion powder. I also grated my carrots with the larger holes and cooked my red potatoes seperately (leaving the skin on). Very easy to make and so scrumptious!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

We love Ethiopian food, and this was one of the very first Ethiopian things I ever tried to make (we usually go to a restaurant for this kind of food)!  This was easy and good, though for us, it had too many potatoes.  I got the big baking kind and only used 3, and that was too much.  The carrot and cabbage got lost in the dish.  Maybe I should have used smaller potatoes.  Next time I'll just use one big one instead of 3.  Easy and yummy, though.  I also made shiro to go with it, and we picked up injera and tibs from a local restaurant.  Gotta figure out how to make the Ethiopian collard green dish next!

My husband thought this was amazing. I think it would have been for me with about twice the spice. Next time, I'll double the turmeric, cumin and pepper (and possibly throw in a little garlic?)

Also, this is a lot to fit in a skillet. I used a big pot instead and that worked just fine.

It's definitely a recipe worth trying. Yum.

I usually follow recipes as written, but as so many doubled the spices, I did too (minus the salt & pepper). The result - DELICIOUS! This was a fantastic, easy recipe we both loved, will definitely make it again!

Just OK...I always follow the recipe exactly the first time and the other review are correct, the spices should be doubled. As written, kinda bland.

Absolutely delicious!  Used 1/3 cup olive oil and doulbed all spices.  I added everything all at once, cooked on high for ten minutes then reduced the heat to medium until the potatoes were just softened.  Don't overcook, a little crunch is a good thing!

This tastes very much like it came from an Ethiopian restaurant! The only thing I would suggest is adding the potatoes a bit sooner.

This delicious dish is easy to prepare.  First time I made it, it took a long time for potatoes to cook so on my second fixing, I microwaved carrots and boiled potatoes whole ahead of time.  Since I did not have room in the skillet for all the vegies, I put the potatoes into a serving dish and cut them into chunks.  Later I added the contents of the skillet and stirred everything together.   I added the cooked carrots to the skillet at the same time as the cabbage and cooked only 9 minutes, since after 9 minutes  the cabbage smell increases (per America's Test Kitchen).  I found that reducing the oil and doubling the spices except salt was a good suggestion by other reviewers.  We may try for a even more spice by adding a bit of hot pepper next time we make it.

Very good dish, but still a little bland, despite doubling the spice. Maybe next time I'll triple it or add less of the vegetables.

This tastes wonderful! I doubled the seasonings and used 1/2 of the olive oil. I substituted Raspberry wine vinegar for the turmeric because I didn't have any turmeric. I will definitely make this again.

Yummy veggie dish!  I think you have to determine which vegetables take longest to cook and start them cooking first.  For me this was the potatoes.  My only change was to splash some balsamatic vinegar over the dish at the end.  I'll add more cumin next time........and there WILL be a next time.

I started by partially cooking the potatoes then adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also used more spice than recipe required.  Great dish and I'd surely make it again.  The turmeric gave it a lovey yellow color as well as great flavor.

This is delicious w/ the modifications recommended by all the helpful reviewers!  I used 3T olive oil & 1T butter, doubled all the spices except salt, & left all the veggie amounts as written.  We really enjoyed this!  Will make it again & try making some injera to go with it.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Very authentic. My husband is from Ethiopia, and I have learned several recipes. I have always liked this "alicha gomen," but never knew how to make it. I tried this recipe, doubled, and my husband and allof his friends couldn't believe his American wife made it.  They loved it and my kids like it too, eaten with injera. You can add more of the spices if you want...taste it first and add to your taste preference. Great side dish for other meals too.

I love this dish! I thought I had already rated it as I've made it several times! I always double the spices and cut the olive oil (add water if necessary). I've also added cooked dried beans if I have some made up in the freezer. Delicious!!

I substituted sweet potatoes to make this a more nutritionally sound vegetarian main dish and used A LOT less oil than was called for. It turned our beautifully.

I love Ethiopian food because it is so spicey,however, I doubled  the spices(suggested by someone else)but I believe I could have put more in. Also can anyone tell me what stops it from sticking to pan. I had to add water. (cooked on an electric stove on simmer)I put cabbage and potatoes in at the same time took about 25 mins to cook. I am going to try it again but with garlic and ginger.

I like spice and basically used 1tsp. of all the spices. I also cooked using 1/4 cup of olive oil. That is just for my preference. The dish is wonderful. The cabbage cooked down with the potatoes staying in nicely intact cubes. It is healthy and delicious!!!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point. Very good , I doubled the cumin and turmeric and also added 1 tsp. curry powder and some garlic powder to taste. I also put some broccoli in it  for colour . Used some chicken stock mixed with cornstarch to make a gravy and since my husband likes meat I browned some chicken thighs and put them in. Mixed everything together and let it simmer covered for an hour.

This is tasty but missing something and i dont know what its called. It looks like a small black seed that ive seen on indian/african dishes before. I will have to google it. I started off by adding a lot of oil, we use a lot of oil usually so .5 cup did not seem a lot to me. I sauteed 1 large onion halved and thinly sliced and 4 cloves of garlic, cooked for 5 min then added the spices which i dbled except for the salt. I then shredded 2 xtra large carrots and cut .5 cabbage very thinly and threw them in the pot. I peeled 2 ave size potatoes and cut into quarters and then sliced super thin about a few cm thick and added to the pot. I did have to a bit of water because my potatoes were sticking to the bottom. but not a lot at all. Served with plain white rice.

This is so good! I cooked the potatoes and just added them at the end, so cooking time was about 30 min total. I also grated the carrots using the large holes instead of slicing. They cooked faster this way, but also I think they mix into the dish better. I didn't want to have 1/2 a cabbage to use up, so I used a whole bag of shredded cabbage (5 serving) and the amount was perfect. I used a curry which had turmeric and cumin, plus a bunch of other spices, and put in WAY more than the spices called for, probably about a TBS; I just kept tasting it till it was right! I use coconut oil instead of olive oil. So delicious! Served it with sliced ham.

Use half the oil than it says, maybe even less.

Made for a crowd.  Sauteed onions and carrots on top of stove, finished in the oven.  Doubled spices as recommended.  Cooked potatoes separately and added last few minutes to absorb flavor.  Cooking in oven allowed me to use less oil.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

I love this dish in Ethiopian restaurants, and was so happy to find this recipe.  This is DELICIOUS and SO easy!  I doubled (or more) the spices and added minced garlic with the onion.  I also cut the oil in half.  I will buy and add ginger next time.

Except for the oil (I used half), I followed the recipe.  The oil is needed to cook the vegies and I know this now.  So next time I will make up for the oil with a liquid or broth.  And next time I will add the cabbage in at the last 15 minutes of cooking.  They became too mushy. AND, next time I will double all the spices (not the salt)as well.  I like that these potatoes, due to the other veggies, kept moist even after a couple of days.  So they were a good snack.

This was so good! I did add some chopped garlic to it, only because I like garlic in almost everything. Love the carrots in this dish. I Just had to add a few slices, chopped bacon to this also, because I love the bacon flavor with cabbage. Also tasted before adding bacon and this is just very good as a meatless side dish. I just prefer the added flavor of bacon. Thanks for this recipe, Looking forward to making this again soon.

I followed the suggestions of Deeli, adding garlic and ginger and increasing the spices. I maybe tripled the turmeric. I also added a splash of chicken broth to help the potatoes get done. Next time I'm planning to make niter kibbeh and use that instead of butter. The Ethiopian name for this, for anyone interested, is atakilt wat.

Oh wow!  This is one of my new favorite vegetarian dishes, for sure.  As suggested by others, I used only 1/4 oil and doubled the cumin and turmeric.  I don't care for cooked carrots, so I omitted those.  Instead of white potatoes, I used sweet potatoes.  A shortcut is to microwave the potatoes, peel and cut into cubes, then add to the pan.

I wish I could give this dish even more stars!! My boyfriend and I both LOVED this dish!! We did make a few changes.
We doubled all of the spices except the salt, I didnt have any turmeric so none of that, we added 3 cloves of minced garlic, and a splash of red wine vinegar at the end to make up a little bit for not having turmeric. We also cooked the potatoes seperatly and added them later.
WILL DEF BE MAKING AGAIN IN MY HOUSE!!!!!!

Double the spices minus the salt just as everyone stated.  I also cut out on the oil because I wanted to save some calories and it worked great.

Oh boy was this salty!!! I knew 1 tsp would probably be too much & wish I'd held off some.  Other than that it is amazing! The other spices I amped up quite a bit. Will make this again & again with my own tweaks: way less salt, more cabbage & less potatoes, more onion, way less oil. I know that seems like a lot of changes, but I just think the oil & salt change healthy, yummy veggies into junk food :(  thanks for sharing! Yum!

This is a delicious side dish.  I used all veggies from my CSA and it was wonderful.  Took everyones suggestions and 1) cut oil to 1/4c and 2) doubled spices.  Perfect.  Panfried leftovers and added some sauteed ground beef; voila- another great meal.

Absolutely delicious!  I just finished 2 bowls right now!  I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup and it was more than enough.  I doubled the spices as per other reviewers suggestion and I had to cook it a bit longer than the suggested 30 minutes after I added the potatoes.  Thank you so much for posting this awesome recipe!

Tasty.  My sugesstion would be to have all your ingredients cut up and ready before you start cooking.  I liked that you had your veggies and strach all in one.

This   is so phantastique, I made this dish twice in a row, because it is that good !!!!
I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil, I doubled the spices, but not the salt . It is so perfect this way and nothing else should be changed
I precooked the carrots and potatoes  just a little bit in the microwave,   which worked out great because the cabbage does not over cook tht way.
This dish goes well with chicken and ham.
Guten Appetit!
This might also work in a slow cooker.
Saute the onions in olive oil, add all ingredients to slowcooker and let it cook!

Using red cabbage is NOT a good idea. It changes the whole taste of the dish.  I do agree on doubling the spices, though.

As written, the recipe is okay but the spices definitely need doubling, at least. Of course, the recipe is somewhat vague as to the actual amounts of the vegetables; for example, my head of cabbage was very large, so those factors could make a big difference regarding the amount of seasoning needed. Really nice flavor, though.

Great St Patty's Day meatless alternative.  Halved the oil, doubled the spices (except salt), and left the skin on the potatoes.  Added a tsp of fresh ginger.  I love potatoes so this dish will now be on my favorites list.

Ethiopian for St. Patrick's Day??? Yep, and it was wonderful with Guinness Corned Beef (on this site).  Followed advice of previous reviewers - 1/2 the olive oil and double the spices.  I didn't have turmeric and added balsamic vinegar instead - which was so good I added more at the end of cooking.  Next time I'll add the potatoes with the carrots and onions.

this is one of my favorite dishes at Ethiopian restaurants and have always wanted to make it. This recipe is fantastic although. At restaurants, the flavors of this dish emanate from the carrot, potato and cabbage, not from being spiced. It's a subtle, sweet flavor. As such, I would not double the spices as so many other reviewers recommended, especially not the pepper.

This so easy to make and tasted so yummy! One thing I would cut back on is the potatos. You only need about 3 to cut up and use. I will make again!

This was (with the recommended doubling of spices) an excellent dish paired with ham steaks.  In fact, next time I think I'll add cubed ham along with the potatoes to make it a one-pot meal!

I made a double batch - also doubling spices - but still only used five potatoes as I wanted more of the cabbage and carrot flavors. This was good; a nice change. The flavors blended well overnight. Have to admit it had the most leftovers after dinner so I don't know that I would make it again.

Absolutely wonderful. I only used 2-3 TBSP of olive oil and it did the trick. I am looking for healthy vegetarian dishes and this is the ticket. I also doubled the cumin and turmeric and used a whole package of coleslaw mix instead of the shredded cabbage. I used baby red potatoes and left the skin on.  It was so easy to make and so healthy and enjoyable. Thanks for the great recipe.

Super good.  The only thing is next time I will triple the salt, pepper, cumin and turmeric.  I did double it as previous comments suggested, but for me it did not benefit enough for the cumin and turmeric flavoring.  I highly suggest triple the spices.  But even with only doubling it, it was still 4.5 stars.

A good recipe...way too much oil though. I did a few variations because I like my vegetables a bit on the crunchy side... I boiled the potatoes in some lightly salted water, then added them to the sauted onions...and fried them until just golden brown...then i added the carrots, the spices ( more is needed of course) and then the cabbage...quickly stirring all the ingredients for a few minutes (maintaining the texture of both the carrots and  the cabbage)

The flavors are great. I doubled the cumin and turmeric and added more salt as advised by other reviewers. The kids liked it and they are very picky. The potatoes required tem minutes more to cook. Overall, a good recipe with all these changes.

I thought this turned out rather potato-heavy. I really liked the seasoning blend, but they didn't seem adequate for the quantity of vegetables; so I doubled them, and I'm glad I did. Next time, I'll either use fewer potatoes or more cabbage and carrots. I don't know that I'd call this recipe "healthy," exactly, as it calls for a lot of oil and is carb-heavy. But it's a delicious and different way to enjoy vegetables, and I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This is so flavorful! We just loved it. I doubled the spices as several suggested. I used about 1/3 C. Oil. I added small chicken pieces because I wanted this as the main meal. I tossed all ingredients until everything was evenly coated with oil and spices. I put them in my air fryer and cooked at 400 degrees for 13 minutes. I liked the little bit of crisp.

I was married to an Ethiopian for 14 years and this is a staple dish at most meals, especially during fasting season (159 days a year btw) when they eat a vegan diet. People keep commenting that they added more spice because it was bland. This dish is like the rice we put in a bowl before adding spicy chili. It is meant to be served in a heap on top of injera with scoops of 2-3 other dishes, most of which are very spicy and flavorful. The cabbage and carrots serve as a palate cleanse between the different flavors of wat served at the meal. If you've never had Ethiopian food, google a restaurant and give it a go. Just tell them its your first time and you want a balance of flavors. I agree with leaving the tumeric out, and suggest using the Ethiopian clarified butter instead. It is called nitter kibbeh, but you can find it as kibbeh ghee as well. Every family meal I attend has this dish. The Irish side of our family has even adopted it to serve with corned beef (a strong flavor) and brisket as a side dish.

This is an okay recipe but as an Ethiopian I have to say it is missing the two main spices that makes it  Tikel Gomen . You really need to add garlic and ginger paste to make it authentic.  It is eaten as a side dish especially during fast or sometimes people add meat to it.

Surprisingly yummy!  I stuck to the recipe with the intention of revising it later.  This is comfort food. Gentle but filling.  I may kick it up with tomatoes and some additional seasoning, but it is excellent as is.

I love this dish.  I made this for my book club pot luck tonight and I'm hoping I can refrain from eating it before then.  As others suggested, I doubled all the spices except the salt, and I added 3 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp minced ginger.   I also used only 2 Tbsp olive oil and 2 Tbsp butter instead of the 1/2 cup oil.   I  added the potatoes 5 minutes after the carrots and 5 minutes before adding the cabbage.  I used an enameled cast iron dutch to cook it in and had no problems with sticking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will be making it frequently.

I made it in the instant pot. After sauteing, I just cooked everything at high pressure for 7 minutes. It came out great! I also had to substitute the oil for vegetable broth since my husband is on a no oil diet, and we still loved it!

Excellent, delicious dish, a new family favorite.  I made a slight modification to adapt this to Instant Pot - saute according to directions (except for potatoes) in Instant Pot on "saute", add potatoes, put on lid and manual pressure cook for 10 minutes (no additional water; the water in the food appears to be enough).  Speeds up completion by 20 - 30 minutes.

Wonderfully delicious with added garlic and ginger.  A little extra turmeric also.  And, the cabbage cooks way down, a bit too much.  Next time I am going to put the cabbage and potatoes in at the same time.  Also,  I doubled the recipe and used a large pot, just because I like doubling recipes to have the ease of leftovers.  The leftovers are fantastic and it tasted even better the 2nd day.

I used sweat potato in my version.  In addition to the onion I added chopped leaks - which if you don't know, is a large green onion.  Added some chipotle red pepper for some heat. It was delicious!  I will be making again.

Cut the oil to 1/4 cup or less. Double the spices except the salt. Add 1/2  teaspoon of garlic powder.  This is an excellent side dish to Ethiopian chicken. Or. I added smoke sausage and served it as a main dish. Good Food!

I changed it up a bit...I made it a little more Indian infused. I used coconut oil, a whole cabbage, a teaspoon and a half  of turmeric (since it is good for you) 1/2 tsp cumin and 1  teaspoon of Garam Masala. Yum!

I love this dish! I have made it several times. I first made it when I was on the Daniel Fast and could not eat meat. I used sweet potatoes instead of red potatoes because they are supposed to be healthier. Not everyone in my family loves the dish as much as me, but it is definitely one of my favorites!

I followed the advice of other reviewers - cut the oil down to a few tablespoons, added garlic and freshly grated ginger and a tinse more salt. It is a great change.

As an Ethiopian woman born and raised in Ethiopia, I love this dish. We call it tikil gomen. So cumin is not necessary here, but to each its own if you want to you can. One more thing, we don't cook food without onion, garlic and ginger... that's a must! It makes every dish delicious!

I followed others suggestions in doubling the spices and the consensus in my home was that it was just okay. The second time I used 4-5 tbsp of bacon fat and wow did that make the dish delicious! My husband thought he was eating it for the first time (he doesn't remember the bleh/okay food items I make but he definitely remembers, and requests, dishes he loves). This dish incited a discussion of Ethiopian foods and encourages us to eat more ethnic cuisines! Thanks for the great recipe!

I love cabbage so I am always looking for new ways to make it.  This was an easy recipe but the taste was a bit bland (and I am always a bit heavy with my spice measurements).  I had some cooked rotisserie chicken from Costco that I would pull apart and add to this cabbage dish that gave it some more flavor and just that little extra something.  I also topped with a bit of Kosher salt.

This was surprisingly good.  I left out the potatoes,  and next time will try it with beans, maybe chick peas. I cut the oil also and it was fine,  would've been too oily with the whole amount.

Love this recipe!  I don't cook it with other Ethiopian dishes, I just use it as a side dish with whatever I'm making.  I only use 3 potatoes and usually a whole head of cabbage.  I cut the oil and pepper in half (due to little ones) and I usually add some cumin seed and a bit more turmeric. Easy to make and delicious!!

Four stars as is. Five stars with a) double the spices b) additional cabbage (I used 3/4 of a head) c) addition of garlic and ginger per another reviewer's suggestion. Enjoyable for any meal; want to add chickpeas or sausage and turn into a filling for breakfast burritos!

Absolutely loved this! I do not eat chicken or beef so I'm constantly looking for non meat meals. Meals that are actually good..and this one definitely is! I did add smoked paprika and a little white wine to steam the potatos and cabbage a little faster :)

I followed the recipe but with all the suggestions on doubling spices and cutting oil.  I added a dash of cayenne for a little spice. Instead of sliced onions I added two cups of chopped onions.

The potatoes I had were very BIG so I used three of them.

I cooked this in a 16" electric skillet.  I have some very large pans but I doubt that all the ingredients would fit.  I cooked the onions and carrots on high for 5 minutes and added the cabbage with all the spices and cooked on high until they were carmelized.  I reduced the heat to medium and added the potatoes.

I had doubts that the potatoes would cook.  I set a timer and stirred everything every 5 minutes just to be on the safe side. After 25 minutes the taters were perfect and the dish was done.  5 minutes later it was GONE!  My family LOVED it.  I LOVED it.

It has a sweet , exotic spicy, veggie, pototoee, taste. It's not soggy and mushy.  This is a keeper.

I think the amount of oil needed is going to depend on the size of your potatoes cabbage and onions. There is no specification in the recipe and the size of the veggies can make a huge difference. It as however, delicious!  I used the whole 1/2 cup and it was not too greasy. I normally make fried cabbage with green bell peppers and onions and we love it but this was a lovely change and a really hardy vegan meal with the potatoes!  So you may need to increase or decrease based on the size of your vegetables. Definitely double the spices. I used more than a tsp of salt but don't know how much more. Enjoy! I also added my potatoes with the carrots and onions at the start. Worked great. Also, my carrots were about 1/2 inch not thinly sliced didn't want mush and they would have been for sure. About 35 total minutes if cook time.

Ok, so when I first saw this recipe, I was a little apprehensive; however, oh. my. gosh. My family (even my 4 year old!) LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! I doubled the spices and it was magnificent. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I heeded the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices and reduced the oil. Since we had a bumper crop of red cabbage that is what I used, plus yellow, orange and red carrots.  It was not only delicious but beautiful! Served it with cheesy polenta.

'Had to use up potatoes & always looking for good cabbage dishes so I went & bought the $5 jar of tumeric in hopes I'd like this.  I followed suggestions doubling pepper & tumeric.  The directions seemed off so I did my thing:  Sauteed onion in 1/4c olive oil about 5 minutes, then stirred in spices.  Then stirred in potatoes.  Then cabbage.  Cooked that ten minutes, semi-covered.  Added the carrots, fifteen more, semi-covered.  Good directions, but the dish wasn't all that impressive.  'Guess I'm not a big tumeric fan.  'Not that it was bad, just not too flavorful.  We'll have some as is & the rest in soup.

If you tweak this recipe, as most of the reviewers have, then it is a 5 star.  I wish the publisher would update it according to the reviews.  Use half the oil and double all of the spices, except the salt.  I will add minced garlic and minced ginger next time.

I have made this recipe according to the directions. Over time, I have modified it. I now use organic sweet potato instead of white potatoes. I fry the cubed sweet potato first so it holds its shape, remove it and put on paper towel to drain, add it back in after the cabbage is cooked and cover for 3 minutes more. I use double the tumeric and add 1/2 teaspoon of berbere spice.

So Good!  Doubled the spices (except salt).  Used Yukon Gold potatoes.  Makes a lot and kids of all ages like it.  Served with country sausage on the side.  The flavors are yummy.  Will make again and again.

Since it was just for two, I halved the cabbage, used only 3 potatoes, doubled the spices, added a teaspoon of cumin seed (whole).  I cooked it in a dutch oven (a Calphalon non-stick "stock pot" actually.  It was outstanding!  So good, in fact, that we've put it into "the book" - our private collection of "do again - and again" recipes!

Bland, boring texture.  Not great. So sad it didn't live up to my hopes.

I made this tonight for dinner- it was sooooo good served with rice... my only changes were adding a little extra of the cumin and tumeric and then I used sliced unpeeled small red potatoes. Wonderful dish that I will definately make again!!!!

Exceeded my expectations!  Doubled the tumeric and added 3 cloves garlic.  Also threw in some beer because it started sticking to the bottom.  Served with Spice rubbed pork chops and sauteed apples.  Thank you!!

3.5 stars, really; I ended up roughly doubling the spices (including the garlic and ginger another commentor noted) and the first night it was quite good.  As leftovers, though, the spices seemed to evaporate and even with more added it was never as good again.  I would say it's best in small dishes, about half of the listed recipe unless there will be several people to share it that first time around.

I was looking to use up some cabbage in my fridge and found this recipe. Didn't have turmeric so added a pinch of curry powder and a splash of balsamic instead. Doubled the cumin and added a little extra salt and pepper.  Also threw in some red pepper for spice. Turned out great! Cheap, easy. Will definitely make again.

Excellent. I am Indian so was skeptical but this dish is really nice. Need to follow the correct sequence with time. Cabbage then potato and cover at the end.

This recipe is pretty close to the Ethiopian veggies at the restaurants I've eaten at.  Made a version once that called for a ton of nutmeg.  Caution... run away from versions that call for nutmeg.

I loved this dish.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 c and doubled the tumeric.  The only thing I would change for next time is either putting in less potatoes or more cabbage.  THe potatoes kind of took over the recipe.

I try to fix something my wife doesn't on the evenings I fix dinner & this fit the bill. As others recommended, I used 1/2 the oil & doubled the spices & it was GREAT! I chopped the cabbage instead of shredding it & put in the carrots & potatoes as per the instructions and they were perfect. Tender, but not mushy at all. The only thing I changed was I left the skin on the potatoes. 
This was the main dish with a nice fruit & yogurt salad to "cleanse the palate'" during the meal.
A SAVER for sure!

Very good. Reduced the oil by half and doubled the seasoning except for the salt as suggested by reviewers. Will make again with even less oil. Served as a side for Peri Peri African Chicken also on this site. Update, I made this again but put an Indian spin on it. I added fresh ginger, garlic, and crushed red pepper. This time I was out of carrots but I added green bell pepper and fresh tomatoes for color. I added fresh cilantro for garnish and served with garam masala rubbed venison steaks. Note to self: leave cabbage in big chunks and add further into cooking process, maybe try with ground beef for 1 pot meal?

Delicious!  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the cumin and turmeric, cut down on the oil (just eyeballed it) and added a little ginger.  I cooked it on low heat longer than the recipe called for and everything softened and the flavors fused together beautifully.  THANKS!  I needed a good cabbage recipe and this is my new favorite.

I have been using allrecipes for years and this is the first time I am rating something. My family, which include my husband and two preschoolers-the harshest critics-all loved this!! I kept waiting for my husband's usual commentary of how I could improve a meal, but he said to keep everything as is! This was great!! Thanks!

Very yummy. I followed one of the reviewer's suggestions to use less oil, add garlic and double the turmeric. Saved time by cutting the potatoes while the cabbage cooked. ;-)

This was really tasty.  I did double/triple the spices and added cayenne, lots of ginger, and lots of garlic.  I also browned the potatoes first, and added kielbasa.  It took quite a while for the taters to soften.  The house smelled really good and the hubs even liked it!

I needed a way to make cabbage and thought this sounded a little bland/boring but figured I'd try it anyway. It was fabulous! I doubled the spices, added ginger and garlic, and used fresh green beans in place of carrots. It was REALLY good. I used about 1/4 c. oil but next time will use even less. It was even great as leftovers the next day. This is definitely going in the dinner rotation.

Delicious flavors!  I wasn't impressed with the cabbage and the carrots. After being cooked for so long they were quite shriveled.  I've experimented with when to add them but haven't figured it out yet.  Maybe I should just cut them larger, I don't know.

Added ginger/garlic paste and used only oil spray and a little veggie broth because my husband is on a heart reversal diet. Also used cumin seed in addition to cumin powder. We loved this and it will become a favorite. Served it with some black-eyed peas and a little hot Louisiana hot sauce. Great use of CSA box veggies!

I just made this dish and I was not sure if I liked it or not until I realized I finished the whole bowl!
My problem was I was eating it too hot and my tastebuds were overwhelmed, let it sit for a few mintues so it isn't so hot and it will taste better.
By the time I got to the bottom it tawted so very good.
I added more Tumeric and went light on the cumin since I am not crazy about that.  For me it needed just a tad more salt at the table.
I will take a suggestion of one reviewer here and add some white beans to make it a veggie dish.
I relly like this it has a nice little kick that stays with you a little.  Thank you for posting this I will make it again.

I just tried this recipe a few weeks ago, and have already made it twice since.  I LOVE it!!!  I add a little extra cabbage and like the potatos sliced rather than cubed.  My 9 and 11 year olds will eat a whole bowl of it (double all spices but pepper).  I find it takes about 35 min to get the potatos perfectly done.  Perfect comfort food!!!!! Yum!!!  Thank you !!!!

This deserves 4 stars on its own, but could easily be made into 5. It was a little bland for me, I would definitely add more tumeric next time. I also made it with "A good easy garlic chicken" from this site, and it was delish! The garlic chicken really added to it. If you dont want to add the garlic chicken, I would at least add some garlic. My potatoes also took about 50 minutes to get soft, not 30. We all enjoyed it, and the chicken made it a 5. (A 4 without)

A little bland but followed some reviews and added a splash of vinegar.  I liked trying something new including cabbage.

This was good.  I didn't have any turmeric so I used the so-called equivalent of ground mustard.  Next time I will use turmeric as it was missing something.  I also only used 4 potatoes which was plenty.  Next time I will add more carrots.

I made this for a variety of different people last week. First of all, it's very simple and it smelled absolutely phenomenal while it was cooking. Everyone really enjoyed it - even people who were turned off by the ingredients. I also didn't have cumin so I used the balsamic vinegar as well.

I cannot tell you enough how awesome this is!  It is more than a sum of the ingredients. I did reduce the oil to 2-3 tablespoons, (even tried it once with coconut oil - YUM!) and made it with more cabbage (had two small heads on hand) and it is a forgiving recipe,  Still came out marvelous and great the next day as well.

Wow!  I loved this dish.  This will definitely be a keeper.  I doubled (almost tripled) the seasonings, used all the oil, cooked the potatoes, carrots and onions first, added a bag of cooked chickpeas and threw the shredded cabbage on top once the potatoes were well cooked (I like my cabbage kind of crispy).  Then I served it over brown rice.  So good and healthy!

This was good.  I made it exactly as written, and my husband and I both liked it.  My kids didn't care for it, but it was a bit different than what they are used to eating.  They do like plain cooked cabbage, but I thought this was a nice alternative.

Loved this! Did not have turmeric so used ras el hanou, which has turmeric in it. I would add more seasoning in general. Very easy, very healthy, very yummy!

A great dish.  I didn't have turmeric, so I used Garam Masala instead. I also added turkey kielbasa because my kids are carnivores.  It was really delicious.  I used about 1/2 the olive oil, and it turned out just fine.  This would be fantastic without the meat, too!

This recipe was mouthwatering!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much, we almost finished off the whole dish between the two of us.  I went right by the instructions with the exception of doubling the cumin and tumeric as several people suggested.  I will definitely be making this again.  I'm going to look for more recipes using these spices, too.

This is the second recipe I have found on this site that is far better than I expected, based on the description. The choice of spices and the oil in my opinion combine to make this absolutely wonderful. I am amazed how good something vegitarian and so so simple can be so good.
I wanted to make it totally stock but by mistake added more cumin and turmeric than indicated, about double. Turned out great!! Next time I'm doubling all ingredients...ate this batch almost entirely by myself.

Giving this 5 stars because it really is very good, it's super easy to make, and all the ingredients you probably have at home anyway.  A lovely dish for not much time, effort or money.  A total keeper.

One of my friends found this and shared with me. have to say it was totally awesome! Even my child who swears he doesn't like cabbage loved it. We added cubed ham as someone else suggested and made it a whole meal. Can't wait to make it again.

This was a fantastic dish!  I love cabbage, so I wish I would have used more.  I stayed true to the recipe since this was the first time I tried it; however, next time I think I'll double the spices!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I have made a "southern" recipe like this I made up a long time ago.  This is actually real good coming from where it does.  I used turnip roots instead of taters for a extra kick.  All in all, good stuff.

This was a nice change, it was really tasty. My boyfriend and I love ethnic food and we both really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I would say to change is to put a little bit less oily - but that might just be a personal preference. Otherwise, it is a great and flavourful way of making cabbage.

This was good. I did double the season but dodn't cut on the oil. Next time I will use a little less oil. I didn't have any turmeric, so I used  dry mustard season. I also added some bacon bits ti. It added a nice homecooked flavor to it.  I think this wood make a great campfire meal!

This dish was easy, cheap and tasty.  I cut back the oil and doubled the spices as recommended by other users.  The only thing that bothered me was that it took way longer for the potatoes to cook than written.  I cooked it for over an hour.  I think the potatoes and cabbage should go in at the same time.  It is supposed to make 5 servings, but it felt more like 10!  I froze the leftovers and have a couple more meals for my BF and me.

This really is a nice and hearty side dish.  It was a nice way to use up left over cabbage and carrots in my fridge.  I didn’t have any onions left so I used couple of shallots and couple cloves of garlic instead.  I only used 2 potatoes because that’s all I had.  I doubled the cumin and didn’t use turmeric because I didn’t have any.  I sprinkled a little bit of celery seed.  Also cut the oil down to about 2 tbsp.   Hubby and I both loved it!

This dish was AMAZING! Following recommendations from other reviewers, I doubled the spices. I served it with Ethiopian ingera bread from a local African market.

Followed advice of others and doubled the spices. This was fabulous. I did add garlic at the end,let it fry for a very long time till things started to carmalize. Wrapped it up in a warm tortilla, was great! Much better the next day if you can stop eating it. Thanks!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is so yummy! I followed others advice and doubled the spices, and only used about half the oil. I sauted the potatoes first to get them crispy then I mixed in the carrots, onions, added some minced garlic & garbonzo beans, then the cabbage, then let it cook together for about 20 minutes. My finance' loved it so much he went back for more! Definately a keeper! Will make again!

Very tasty and a nice change my regular fare of chicken...chicken...and more chicken!  I followed a few other suggestions and doubled the spices (except the salt)--next time I think I will try increasing the cumin and turmeric even more.  I also cut the onion in half.  I let this cook slowly over low heat to allow the flavors to intermingle and it was fantastic.  For non-vegetarians I added some sliced smoked turkey sausage and it was a great compliment to the flavors of the cabbage and carrots!  Everyone who has tasted it has asked for the recipe!!!

Oh my goodness simply delicious!!! So simple to make yet so tasty, I loved the flavor, but I did nearly double the amount of spices (except salt) and I also added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon. 

What I love about this recipe is that these ingredients are so simple to find and most likely you already have on hand.

I have made this twice already and both times it disappointed me. First try: Omitted turmeric because I didn't have any and added ground beef; the taste was blah. Second try: Used sweet potato since I didn't have regular and added ground beef. Still blah! I had to add some hot sauce to make it worth eating. Not making this again!

I doubled or trippled the spices but still found this a little bland.  I love the texture though.  Will play with the spices and try to kick it up a notch.

so, so good...but takes so long to prepare!  make sure you have a food processor if you attempt this recipe.  the flavor is wonderful and the texture is pretty nice too.  we will try again once we have the food processor.  it's just too much to hand chop, slice and grate.

Wow, we totally loved this!  I did make some changes, but I don't think they actually improved the dish or made it worse.  It just made it work for us.  I first partially cooked the potatoes separate from the cabbage using half the oil, and when they were done, started the carrots & onions.  I doubled the cumin because I LOVE cumin.

The only other difference was that I chopped a leftover cooked chicken breast and added it with the cabbage.  I would have preferred it without the meat (because I love vegan recipes and prefer to make things authentically), but my boyfriend needs the protein.  He adored it and ate two servings, which he NEVER does unless he totally loves something.

Awesome!  I loved that it seemed just a little familiar (because I love Indian and middle eastern cooking), but still tasted different from everything I've ever tried before.  We will SO be having this regularly, at the BF's request.

I loved this recipe.  It was one of very few recipes that require potatoes and not "can of something" soup and cheese.  I accidentally doubled the spices except salt.  So, I can't speak to it being bland.  Doubling seemed to work for us.  I guess it could be considered high in oil.  It was fine for us, but if that's a concern I would reduce the oil by no less than half and add more if needed.

I'm sure it was authentic, just bland for us.  I wish I had read the reviews that said to double the spices.  I ended up smothering it in cheese and topping with sour cream...not so much Ethiopian at that point though but very good.

This dish was very good. I used the spices that were suggested but measured them into the dish at all of the same quantity.  While the dish was easy to make, I found it to lack a little in flavour so I will experiment next time in adding some Ethiopian inspired spices!

This was delicious.  I  used sweet potatoes as that was all that I had on hand.  I used 1.5 times the cumin and tumeric per recommendations.  I served with kielbasa and sour dough toast.  Amazing!  I will definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this recipe. The recipe calls for cooking the cabbage for too long. Adding the potatoes made it even mushier. There was too much oil, and the ratio of vegetables to potatoes was way off.

I would make this dish again, but not using this recipe. I'd add more seasoning, use half of the oil, double the cabbage, and leave out the potatoes altogether.

I had to make several substitutions based on what I had on hand. Regardless, there are two things that I still would have changed even if I had everything: like many have said in the other reviews, this needs WAAAY more spice than what the recipe calls for (even half a cabbage has a ton of surface area for flavor to get thinned out over), and I'm also not sure why the potato is added last; I cut them up pretty small, and they still weren't fully cooked after 30 minutes. If I do this again, I'll swap the cabbage and potato timing.

Substitutions I made and how they turned out: 1) added some celery because I was short on carrot. It didn't hurt, but it didn't really add anything to the dish, either. 2) roommate ran off with the black pepper, so I used white pepper and a pinch of cayenne. The white pepper was okay, but I should have added more cayenne for that sinus-tingling black pepper kick. 3) Lastly, didn't have turmeric, but I subbed about 2 tsp of minced ginger. Not quite the same taste, but it added a nice flavor nonetheless, though I probably could have gotten away with another tsp or two.

I followed directions to a T, but the potatoes took forever to soften so the cabbage became mushy.  Also, it needed more salt and I hardly ever use salt.  Did I do something wrong?

Made it alongside some Sega Wat and Mesir Wat, really nice complement! I doubled the spices like others recommended, and I used a whole head of cabbage, skipping potatoes. Fantastic!

This recipe was simply amazing. I followed everything step by step and it came out so good. I plan to make this again. I really like it because the ingredients are simple and this is definitely in my price range. This made enough for about 4-6 servings.

I didn’t cook the veggies in the order this instructs because potatoes take longer than others.

Turned out great. I did not add the spices, frankly I am not a fan of cumin nor did I have turmeric. But I did add a spoonful of salsa to give it some spice.

Paired this with falafel and black bean hummus. I used the food processor to slice the cabbage so it sorta melted away in the pot. the end result tasted great but the flavours are mild. Would definately make again

I wish I would have read the reviews for the tips. This definitely needed the spices to be doubled. It was bland based on the measurements in the recipe. That or reduce the amount of veggies. I agree that it was easier to make in a pot. Not sure how to fix it but I’ll figure something out because it’s too much food to waste.

This is a great quick and easy meal. I season to taste which was more than listed in the recipe. I also like my potatoes with a little crispness to them and I don’t like my cabbage super soft, so I cooked the potatoes separate from the cabbage and combined at the end.

Like others have recommended, I doubled the spices and used less oil. This dish is very flavourful and my kids loved it. I have made it twice now. On my second try I was not paying attention and burnt some of the cabbage, it still turned out great!
Even better the second day!!!!

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  No changes in ingredients, but doubled spices as others recommended.  Like my carrots and onions softer, though, so cooked them some  with spices before adding cabbage and potatoes.  Will definitely make gain.

I love this community for the great reviews and tips and tricks. Followed the ones here mentioning less oil, more spice and made it in a big pot. I used a whole head of cabbage and it still turned out amazingly. Such a simple and great dish!

Great flavor but I did what the other commenters said which was to double the spice except salt and cut the oil to 1/4 cup.  I may have cooked to long but will do what another said which was to put potatoes in first and then add cabbage and carrots since the cabbage gets too done along with everything else.  I added some grilled turkey sausage at the end and everyone enjoyed it..

It's good, but if definitely needed more salt and more spice. We doubled the salt, put in more cumin, more tumeric, some paprika, and red pepper flakes.

I made this twice and enjoyed it more the second time. I would taste it first before doubling the spices. The first time I made this I doubled the spices and the pepper was too much.  I doubled the salt, added a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and garlic powder the second time I made it and it was fine for me. Lastly I used vegetable broth instead of olive oil to reduce the calories and fat. I added the broth as needed.

This is my new favorite cabbage recipe. I followed the directions except cut oil to 1/3 cup. It came out perfect! My husband is a vegetarian so I added some meatless chicken strips, seasoned and browned, to the finished product. This is definitely a keeper.

I'll brainstorm a way to get more flavor directly to the potatoes next time I make this. (Presoak them in salt water? Chop bigger and add them with salt to the other root veggies?) Double spices, half oil, use white pepper instead of black.  I added ginger and garlic as others recommended

Simple, savory and flavorful.   The cumin and turmeric make this dish a great meal.  The leftovers are taste even better, after the spices have blended more thoroughly with the cabbage and onions overnight.    I'll be making this again.

I liked this recipe but it wasn’t quite what I was looking for - I took others advice and doubled the pepper/cumin/turmeric, so perhaps I threw off the flavor profile. I was looking foward to trying to immitate the canbage dish I like so much at Ethiopian Restaurants but this wasn’t quite it. Still tasty though & felt very healthy!

I don’t know anything about Ethiopian food but this is a really good dish. I agree with the doubling of seasoning and I would keep the 1/2 cup oil if you intend to cook as directed. However I did find the potato’s took much longer to cook which caused the onion and cabbage to be really mushy. Next time I’ll use 1/4 cup of oil and precook the potato’s before adding to the skillet. Don’t be turned off by the ethnicity of this dish, its a very flavorful dish that if served in any restaurant you would never assume it to be from Ethiopia. I’m know very curious to find more recipes from this region. Thank you for sharing this great dish.

The flavor was great when doubling the spices as many have suggested. Unfortunately, the potatoes were very undone, and the cabbage was mushy. I had to keep adding water to prevent sticking. I will make it again, but add the potatoes before the cabbage next time.

The only change I made was adding water about halfway through cooking to finish steaming the vegetables and added more garlic than the recipe called for. It came out great though!

I would have given it five stars, but ... I grabbed the wrong bottle of spice and sprinkled generously with garam masala but it was delicious.  I did add turmeric  and was generous with garlic because I'm averse to onions.  I didn't realize how beautifully the chopped carrot would be sauteed.  A great side dish in one pan.  I'd probably love it all roasted, too, but making it a pan gives you more control.

I added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic & 1/2 fresh ginger also minces. Plus substituted 2 sweet potatoes for 3 of the 6 white potatoes.  I added the sweet potatoes after cabbage softened about 10 mins before putting in the white potatoes because it is more dense than a white potato

This recipe is tasty and was a great way to use up all the cabbage I had in the fridge. I didn’t have carrots, but I had a large head of Brussels sprouts so I shredded them just like the cabbage and added it in. It worked great! I did take other people’s recommendations to double the turmeric, and still found it to be a bit less flavorful than I was hoping, but it was still very good.

Good.  I doubled the spices as suggested by others.  I wish I had mixed the spices together first before adding; it was tough mixing things up when I added them separately.

Not that this dish needs another review but I'm giving it 4 stars.  I added in garlic, doubled the cumin & turmeric and added a bit more salt but when it was done, it still seemed that it was lacking something.  I don't like things oversalted or overly spiced but neither was the case even after my additions.  Something was missing - I might try it again sometime and experiment.

This is so good!  I wanted to make a one pot meal so I added ground lamb with the onion and cooked until it was no longer pink. Used maybe a tablespoon of olive oil. Doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 3 cloves of garlic as others suggested. Used a cast iron wok, which worked well because this recipe makes a lot. Absolutely delicious. Would make without lamb as a side dish. Everyone liked it, even a picky tween.

I tripled the spices, but not the s/p. Delicious! Even better reheated over low heat the next day. Our local Ethiopian restaurant in Phoenix used to sell these tightly wrapped in flour tortillas. They were terrific!

This dish is fantastic- easy to make and tastes wonderful. Bonus- it can be a side dish or a main meal. My modification - I upped the spices and will use some chilli next time for more kick.

I made this without the turmeric and it turned out really good. This is a great way to put more vegetables in you diet, although we love a lot of the veggies out there.

This needs work...  I went against my better judgment and added the potatoes when the recipe said to and what I ended up with was mushy cabbage and hard potatoes.  Also it’s not very flavorful even when doubling the spices.  Im not giving up on it though, I’ll try roasting the potatoes first with some seasoning and also see if I can find the Ethiopian seasoned clarified butter.

I LOVE this dish! I have made it several times and always use the tips others have suggested such as doubling spices amd reducing the oil. 
Once however, I used purple cabbage. It tasted awesome, per usual, but it looked quite horrifying. Would not reccommend that if you are going for visuals hahah
Great recipe ??

This is a great recipe, with modifications: as others noted, I cut oil to 1/4 cup and doubled all spices except for salt. I also added minced garlic and ginger (5 minuets after onions, fry for 1 minute before adding the rest of the ingredients)... Last thing: the cumin is optional, I like the dish better without it. Will definitely be making it often!

I loved this dish.  I tried to cut a corner the first time out and use a packaged pre-shredded cabbage.  I do not recommend that.  The second and third times, I used a fresh cabbage head and shredded it myself which was much much better.  It is easy to make and very tasty.   
I did make two changes in the original recipe.   I cut down on the oil used in the recipe and added a bit more of the spices.   I actually used 2 Tablespoons of olive oil (instead of 1/2 cup) which I found to be adequate and saved calories.  For me reducing the oil made it a more "affordable" dish calorie wise.   I like a bit more spice.  I didn't double it, but added another half of the amount called for.    Delish.

The author is correct, do not need to add any liquid.  Maybe a dash more of cumin could amp this up a bit.  Served this Ethiopian dish with grilled mushroom and swiss brats.  That combo actually works well.  The side dish would go well with a great range of grilled meats.

Good simple taste! I like the slight sweetness of the carrots with the consistencies of the potatoes. Good easy dish to make. I didnt wait to add the potatoes, just put them in with the cabbage. Turned out great!

Confession:  We adjusted the recipe based on comments here. We reduced the oil by half & doubled the spice amounts and added garlic & ginger.
The result was lovely. This isn't a fancy dish, but it's flavorful, attractive & tasty. Went well with pork chops.

Love this recipe because it has a nice little kick with the cumin and turmeric.  I did substitute sweet potatoes for the white; it gave it that sweetness which was a nice contrast to the spicy seasoning.  Will definitely make this again for my growing vegetarian family.

This is an amazingly good recipe. Since I cooked a whole head of cabbage instead of a half, I more than doubled the spices (including salt). I also added garlic, ginger, and a bit of garam masala. The dish was complex in flavor and absolutely delicious. Based on recommendations, I did cook the potatoes and onions first and then added the carrots, and then the cabbage and spices.  The result was a delicious combo that still maintained the distinction of the potatoes and the carrots but mixed in with the natural water released from the cabbage and the spices, created a nice gravy to accompany the dish. Two thumbs up!

This was excellent. I modified it by reducing the oil to a bit less than 1/4 cup, doubled spices but not salt, substituted white pepper for black, added 1 tbs of apple cider vinegar to deglaze the pan once the carrots were caramelized a bit, and used two sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. And I threw in 1/2 lb of tofu at the end for protein. This is going into our regular vegan dinner rotation.

Surprisingly delicious for how simple it is! Sure to please at a potluck, as a side dish, or a main course. I used half this amount of oil, but didn't change the spices. It would may be better with a little garlic and ginger, but honestly what isn't?

Oh my goodness, this was sooo...good! I needed a dish to take to a church lunching and I wanted to use what I had on hand without running to the grocery.  I read the reviews first for any tips. The only thing I changed was I didn't use as much oil as called for and I sauteed the onions & carrots , then added the  potatoes to cook for a few mins. before adding the cabbage. I added the spices called for plus I added  ground ginger as another viewer suggested.  The only thing I didn't like as another viewer also said  was the yellow color the turmeric  turned the veggies.....this could have been my  fault as I tend to eyeball some ingredients a lot ...so I may have used a little too much!  Overall It was a big hit.....and I will be making it often!

This was sooo good! I very rarely comment, but this one made me sign-in again, because it's that good. So easy, and enjoyable for parents and kids x3. Only change I made was to double the spices as others suggested. Thank you!

I know the recipe calls for sliced onions but I take 1 to 2 large onions and chopped mine in a bowl, then transfer and cook as follow in the recipe. This dish is the bomb, I just finished cooking it and also going to make homemade bread with it. The family loved it.

Excellent! Came out just as good as in authentic Ethiopian restaurants. Planning on making more soon. I didn’t make any substitutions except halving the recipe; next time I’ll make the full amount.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it time and time again and it has been delicious every single time! I only use 2 potatoes, I add some minced garlic and season it with salt, pepper and cumin. It's amazing!

My wife and I liked it, but it was a little too peppery for her. I didn't have turmeric, so I substituted curry powder. Maybe using both curry powder and black pepper made it that way, next time I'll use just the curry powder and see if it comes out less peppery. Otherwise it was delicious.

Much too much oil.  Not enough spices. Recipe needs to be more specific about the amount of potatoes.  I don't understand why so many people like it.  . The most helpful positive review says that the recipe has to be changed to make it taste like a dish in Ethiopian restaurants, and then gives it 5 stars.  This site needs to work on their review platform.

I really liked this dish but it is a little oil heavy. I'm going to try it in the slow cooker with less oil and a little stock. As per other reviews I put more spices in.

I fixed this for my vegetarian son.  I used pre-cut goods from the produce section and it went really quick.  As other reviewers said, needs way more spices.  Double.  We liked it!  More cabbage and spices next time!

I love this dish. sometimes I use purple cabbage which taste just as great, but beware as it gives the dish a very unsettling color.
I also like to add chicken

I found this recipe this past week and tried it a few days later. The first time i made it I loved it so much that I made it again a few days after that for lunch. One of my new favorite recipes that i will rotate in and out of the menu. I did make changes from the very beginning. I didn't have any olive oil so i cooked it in Coconut oil. I think 1/2 a cup is too much oil and i went with 1/4 a cup of oil. I also used Red Potatoes and red onions instead. I like the sweetness of the red onion and i feel like red potatoes just cook a little faster.  Finally i took the advice of the other reviews and doubled the turmeric and cumin.  My husband loved it too, but he said he was unsatisfied due to the lack of meat. So this time around when i made it I just cooked some chicken in the oven with the same spices that the cabbage dish called for and let him eat it. I personally think it tasted fine without it. :) Would highly recommend this Dish!

Delicious! Few things though. First, double the spices. I did that and then a bit extra. Second, in my opinion 2 potatoes was PLENTY, with 5 if would have been mostly potato and just a bit of cabbage. Cooking wise, the cabbage and potatoes do not release enough liquid as the writer says.. I had to add liquid about every 10 minutes or it would start to burn. That all being said, it went wonderfully with Beef Tibs from Serious Eats- together they made one AMAZING Ethiopian dinner!

Was delicious with a few changes. Listing these from most important to least.

1) Halve the oil - even with only half it was a pretty greasy dish
2) Double the turmeric and cumin, or it will be very bland.
3) Either cube the potatoes smaller, or precook them in the microwave for a couple minutes; otherwise they will be undercooked.
4) My cabbage may have just been small, but when I prepped the recipe with 2/3rds of a cabbage and 5 small potatoes, it still had too little cabbage and was predominantly potato. Use half of a large cabbage, or one whole small cabbage.
5) A tablespoon of minced garlic added in with the other spices really rounded out this dish nicely.

With the addition of extra spices this is a good dish. I would probably add the potatoes in with the carrots and onions so they can get a head stArt cooking before adding the cabbage.

Loved the flavors! Pretty good for weight watchers with just potatoes and oil adding points. I'll tweet the proportions and experiment with some other veggies in the future. Thanks.

I really like this dish. As usual I always modify dishes to add more of what I like. I'm trying to cut calories so I use only two small potatoes and I used one medium-size sweet potato. I used the whole head of cabbage instead of just half the head. And to add more protein I added garbanzo beans. This time I doubled the spices because I like a spicy dish.

This recipes is so delicious! However, my suggestions would be to echo what others have said about decreasing the amount of olive oil-- I would say to 1/3 cup and to double the amount of spices. Also, when I made this dish, I did not have white potatoes and only had sweet potatoes and I honestly think that the sweet potatoes really gave it the perfect taste. Try it! You won't be sorry!

Excellent. Took advice from other commenters and added:
  - 1tbsp of garlic
  - 0.5tbsp of ginger
  - doubled the tumeric and cumin
  - cooked with butter instead of oil. 
Very tasty!

This grew on me the more I ate it. My husband liked it a lot. I would use more carrots next time. I doubled the spices as others suggested and then I sprinkled even more cumin in top. I think I overdid the cumin a bit. Next time I will just double and not add any extra. Also sprinkled some garlic powder on it. I changed the cooking time also. Once I added the cabbage I sautéed it for a couple minutes and then added the potatoes. I did not cook the cabbage for 10-15 min before adding the potatoes. That would have turned it to mush. The potatoes took about 30 minutes to cook once they were added. I might make this again. It's a good recipe.

GOOD EASY I love cabbage but need diffferent ways of making it. This is a good change. I have made several times. I like it 
with the potatoes because for some meals it covers both in one dish. I like it also without. I coarsley chop not shred cabbage. I also don't think the carrots need to cook to long before cabbage, they don't need to get to soft

This was very good, needed to use up cabbage.   I modified it a little though, doubled spices except pepper & salt.  Reduced oil to 2 tablespoons, used whole cabbage, 3 red potatoes, and tofu.  Also because I reduced the oil, I found I had to had a little water (not much) at the bottom to keep from sticking.

Fabulous, delicious, satisfying comfort food with a few tweaks. After reading the reviews I doubled the spices, added about 1 teaspoon of minced ginger, 2 minced garlic cloves.  I reduced the olive oil to about 2 tablespoons and added about 1/4 cup of water to compensate. I also used about three medium potatoes and three small yams.  I peeled the yams, and left the skin on the potatoes  Yum!  The excessive oil is not missed!  Here's the procedure for the Instant Pot.
Saute the onions and white potatoes first for about 5 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, spices carrots and sweet potatoes for another 2 minutes or so.  Add the cabbage and water. Seal the lid, use the manual setting for 5 minutes.  When that's done, leave it on L for 2 minutes, turn off.  Let it stand a minute or two, and release the pressure manually.  
I served it as a vegetarian meal with brown basmati rice.  Had company for dinner and received rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again....and again....and again.

Amazing!  My daughter even said she didn't want anything else for dinner when I make this because she doesn't want to have to "leave room" for anything else.  I doubled the spices but otherwise followed the recipe.  This is going in the rotation.  Wonderful!

We loved it. I did increAse spices to 1/2- 3/4  teaspoons and cut salt to 1/2  teaspoon. I left out the oil and added a little water to finish steaming at the end. These changes made it fit our low salt /blow fat diet. So tasty

I never imagined how incredible this would turn out but wow. I don't use olive oil over heat so I used coconut oil and I realized I was out of turmeric after I started so I used curry powder instead. Probably turned it into a different dish entirely but everyone in the house raved about it so awesome!

This is really super tasty. I'm giving it only four stars because I feel it needs a lot of edits. Half the olive oil, double the spices (except the salt) and reduce the cook time of each step (unless you are committed to waiting for extra mushiness!) Next time I will try adding garlic.

However, it was great i had two plates! And everyone else liked it to including my sister! So yeah, I'll be making this on my next daniel fast!!!!!

I made it exactly as indicated except for doubling the spices.  If I make it again, I will probably add some sort of heat.  Just a little bit of kick to balance the sweetness of the carrots and cabbage.

Definitely increase the spices. If I make it again, next time I will add twice the salt and some garlic in the beginning. Also definitely remember to put it on low/medium heat after the initial sautéing phase or the bottom of the pot will get crusty. This is coming from a grad student without a  lot of free time but so far it seems like a great recipe. just up the spices - maybe some curry powder if it's lying around

I've made a lot of cabbage dishes but never added cumin or turmeric to any of them. This was very different, and I enjoyed it for a change. I did cook my potatoes in oil first; I was trying to get a more browning and crispiness to them. They really didn't get that brown but they did soften up. I removed them from the pan and set aside. I added them back to the cooked cabbage mixture (that softened up after 15 min), and then let it continue to cook another 5 min. I also added some garlic and onion powder. Nice recipe!

This was delicious! My very picky husband also loved it and would like to have it again. I followed the many suggestions to cook potatoes first and double spices except salt. Not sure how much oil I used as I "eyeball" it and added as necessary.  I think I would also like this with the original amount of spice :). We also enjoyed with Keilbasa (cooked separately) which was a very complimentary flavor.

Excellent!!!  We did add some home made Polish sausage and doubled the turmeric, based on other reviews.    It was amazingly good.  Oh, we also tossed in a little red pepper flakes.

I made this but  used sweet potatoes instead of white. I also was fasting at the time. It's a wonderful dish, that is very savory, and healthy for you!

Made it with fresh Brussel sprouts and reduced cooking time for the Brussel 10 about 10 minutes. They gave it a sweetness that just set it off!! Great meal!

I used an entire head of cabbage AND doubled all of the spices to accommodate for that.  Please remember to not add water..... But please  don't walk away while cooking this or the food might scorch.   I found myself gently turning the cabbage and potatoes often so they wouldn't stick to the pan.   

Delicious results!

I was looking for things to eat while doing my Daniels fast and I came across this recipe. As suggested I did double the seasonings but I think I let the potatoes cook to long before so they were a little mushier than I would have liked. Overall I would say it was a great and filling meal and reminded me of a curry flavored dish which I personally enjoyed.

This was great. I added one small sweet potato, with the regular potatoes and a green pepper and pepper flakes. Only I would add the potatoes with the onions n carrots to get totally tender. #awesomesauce ??

The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is that it calls for too much oil. We eat sausage and cabbage often, so I simply added the onions, carrots, potatoes and seasonings to the large skillet which I use to cook sausage and cabbage. You can either slice the sausage or leave the link whole. Just add water to cover the bottom of the skillet well and cook everything together and at one time. Super easy!

I would cut way back on the oil, it was very oily.  Also would go a tad heavier on the spices. But otherwise it was good, great over rice and I will make it again

I found this by searching the word "potluck" and was intrigued as I have never made anything Ethiopian.  It was delish!  I followed other reviewers and added minced ginger and fresh garlic plus doubled the spices.  This is a keeper, and bonus: it's cheap to make!

This is my first Ethiopian dish and it came out pretty good. I did not have cumin to add to the taste but it was okay without it. I would make this dish again, but next time I will make sure to add cumin. Also, in the reviews it's suggests to add 2 teaspoons minced garlic. I think it would be a good addition to the flavor so I will add it and see how it tastes.

This was fantastic. I doubled the spices (not the salt) and wow.  In a strange way this tasted meaty and sweet.Next time i'm going to cut back on the oil , for it was a touch on the greasy side.

This ended up being delicious.  4 out of 5 stars because the original recipe was bland and I needed to amp up the spicies quite a bit.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and changed the cooking order (added potatoes when the recipe said I should be adding cabbage).  The final result was 5 stars.

This recipe is a regular for us! My husband and i love it! 

One idea i came up with is to turn this simple recipe into an even more simplistic side dish! I had some leftover pre- shredded cabbage that needed to be used, so I simply sauteed it with the oil and spices in the recipe and it made the perfect healthy side dish!

I and my Ethiopian fiancé loved it, but I had to twist the ingredients a lot. The tumeric should be 1/2-1 teaspoon rather than 1/4. I also doubled the black pepper and used season all salt, and 1/4 of the sea salt (the potato's will suck the seasoning). I boiled the carrots and potato's before mixing it with the sautéed onions (I hate hard potato). overall it turned out great, although I did a lot of tweeking to the ingredients for more taste, its a great start and you can always adjust it as you please.

I followed the advice in comments of doubling all spices but the salt and had an amazingly tasty meal. I make this in the crockpot now. I use vegetable or chicken stock in place of the oil and add smoked sausage cut into rounds when I crockpot cook it.

I absolutely love this recipe.  My husband and family always love when I cook this dish.  I do add Cyan Pepper  to make it spicy.  Often I grill chicken with the same seasonings chop it into 1" cubes and add it to the mix and serve it over white rice.

As I'm always looking to save time and cut corners, I took another reviewer's recommendation to use the bag of coleslaw already cut up.  I also doubled the spices as recommended.  And I added a can of garbanzo beans so that it could be an all in one meal.  I did much less olive oil and left out the black pepper.  It's a somewhat delicate flavor, but tasty none-the-less.  If my husband likes it, I'll make it again.

This was a very simple and delicious dish to make! It is very tasty the day after, too. I would highly recommend trying this dish for your next meal. I added cauliflower to the dish (.. I think that cauliflower and turmeric are a nice compliment.) Enjoy!

This dish is a wonderful way to cook cabbage. Definitely double the turmeric. I do not cook with cabbage a lot, but this will get made again and again.

Tasty, nutritious and if you already have the spices cheap cheap cheap! I did have to add a little water to the pot because the lid was too loose to trap steam. This is going to be a winter standard in this house!

I used red cabbage, baby red potatoes & rainbow carrots as that's what I had on hand.  Perhaps I just didn't have the heat high enough, but I had to add 20 minutes to the cook time in order to get the potatoes cooked through.  Very tasty once it was done, though. EDIT 10 15 17: My husband just suggested serving this with corned beef and I can't imagine why I didn't think of that myself.

This was my first time making it.  I started off following the recipe but definitely had to add water to keep it from burning or overcooking.    I took some of the others' advice and added fresh garlic and ginger and that helped for it to not be so bland.  I also sliced the potatoes about 1/4" thick (after cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise) because it would have had to cook too long in 1" cubes.  The long slices seem to go better with the style of the dish.  I would try making this dish again but with a lot of tweaking... Otherwise it is pretty bland and can easily become overcooked.  It's best eaten with homemade injera bread.

I added the ginger and garlic as suggested in reviews.  And I left out the onion and potato, because I didn't have those ingredients.  The flavours were very nice indeed.  I baked the recipe in the oven whilst I cooked a large loaf of bread.  I made the Ethiopian Cabbage in the oven in two separate containers: one with vegetarian sausages, and the other half with basa (white fish) wrapped in foil on top, for a separate meal.  Both served with the wholewheat cobbler bread.

Other than cutting the olive oil by half (as I read in the other reviews) I stuck by the recipe.  Absolutely Fantastic!  We loved it and the left overs went with the Mr. to work where he shared it with a few.  Rave reviews from the guys there as well.  Definitely going in my rotation.  Thanks for the share!

I was amazed at how delicious this was for something so simple. The reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because the man of the house wasn't completely satisfied, he said "It needs meat."

Good, but not the 5 star Ethiopian cuisine that I drooled over while living in the Central District in Seattle (where there were about 10 Ethiopian restaurants within blocks of my house).  I think I just need to hire an Ethiopian to teach me .... so far all the Ethiopian recipes I have tried to make have been underwhelming.

This is great all it needs to be authentic Ethiopian food is ,  minced ginger and  garlic when  sated with the onion ,jalapeno pepper sliced in the middle add @ the end.it does not make it spicy but gives it a nice flavor.this can be made with crashed tomato sated with the onions if you don't have turmeric or for variety. Tray it you wile love it even moor!

It was great! Used a little butter instead of olive oil.

Truly authentic! Just like I remember it back in Ethiopia! I did how just altered it a bit by adding minced garlic and more turmeric. Otherwise delish !

I made this today only I added garlic powder, a spoonful of butter, and i didnt have cumin or tumeric so I used a few sprinkles of jamaican curry powder. My kids and husband loved it.

Husband and I love this recipe, but would NEVER use that much oil, EVER.  Yuck.  I use about two tablespoons, and, then, when needed, I add chicken broth.  When the chicken broth becomes absorbed I add more, etc.  I just keep checking on it.  I've made it with the potatoes and without the potatoes, and both is delicious.

Turned out very well! We've been trying more plant-based meals and this is both savory and filling! Used about 2 tbsp oil and some water instead of 1/2 cup of oil, also added more cumin and tumeric. Someone suggested Ginger which I'll have to try next time!

I really enjoyed this.  Made for a tasty dinner.  I did follow the recommendations and double the cumin and turmeric.  I also did half olive oil and half butter just out of personal preference.

This is DELICIOUS! I was afraid of what my husband might think, but he loved it too. I would definitely reduce the oil. I put in more spice too. Be careful of the tumeric, everything it touches turnes yellow :)

This is a hearty and satisfying dish that surpassed my expectations! My husband adored it and has already asked for it again. I did make some changes. First of all, I used a pot and not a skillet. I omitted the salt and most of the oil (used a water/oil saute method). As for spices, I added 1 teaspoon of "rasel hanout", a Moroccan spice blend that I found on Amazon (sorry, I did not have an Ethiopian spice blend on hand), and I would definitely use it again. I also added more cumin and pepper to taste. As for the main ingredients, I used uncut baby carrots instead of sliced. (Lazy!) Next time I will use regular carrots, sliced, and I will start by cooking the potatoes with the onions first to give them a 15-20 minute head start.

This is a delicious dish! I've made it several times for my family and they all love it. The flavor is light yet very good. I reduced the amount of potatoes and added a bit more cabbage and it's a hit! This will certainly become a family staple.

It was a pretty good staple dinner recipe, given that I tend to have most of the ingredients on hand. I agree with the other reviewers to double the spices (not the salt).

I doubled the spices as everyone else suggested and this dish is one of my absolute favorites! I made it 4 nights ago and I am making it again tonight! Although cornbread isn't ethiopian it pairs well with cabbage in my opinion, so I made the meal with the Vegan Agave Cornbread from this site.  This dinner was a big hit at my house! Thanks for the recipe  :-)

Doubled spices as suggested except for salt will add more spice next time, will add potatoes with cabbage and onions next time in order to keep cabbage a little more firm.

Just tried this for the first time, would give it 5 stars except that I tweaked the recipe a bit. Double the spices as others said and use a bit less oil. I used curry/coriander mix as I was out of cumin, and used 3 smaller potatoes... This was DELICIOUS!, I have to stop myself from eating it all in one sitting!

This stuff is GOOD.  Melt in your mouth, zing it up with spiciness.  I love it.  I have nothing more to say than if you follow the recipe, you will have a great time eating this.  I made it alongside some chicken curry and naan.  Can't believe veggies are this awesome!

I love the change to the normal fried cabbage dish, however I had to tweak a few things to my liking.  I added a little more seasoning such as salt, onion powder and cumin powder, however I still fell as though something is missing.  Also I think the next time I make this I will not add the cabbage until after I've added the potatoes in order to avoid the cabbage from being too wilted and overcooked.   I happen to like a little crunch to may cabbage.  Otherwise, it's a winner and I'll use this for our next family gathering to see what others think to determine if this will be a dish to keep on my menu for entertaining friends and family.  Nevertheless I like the change indeed.  Maybe just a few more tweaks to make it a true winner for my taste and family.

I've never eaten Ethiopian food but had most all of the ingredients to make this. I didn't have any white potatoes so I used the (one) sweet potato I had and I didn't have turmeric so per another reviewers advice, I used balsamic vinegar. What a wonderful flavor! This will definitely be added to my rotation. Thank you so much!

I made this last night for my hubby and girls. I am a vegan, so I added garbanzo beans to mine for a complete meal. I did double the seasonings, add garlic, and I parboiled the potatoes. It wasn't clear to me in the recipe if the potatoes were to be cooked or raw. This will be a "go to" recipe for us. It would be an easy recipe to have all the veggies chopped up the night before, so you could whip it together quickly after work. I could see doing that and getting a rotisserie chicken, easy work night meal.

This is the best way to do cabbage!  Like other reviewers I dialed down the oil, added garlic and a dash of ginger.  I recommend making this ahead and letting it sit for a day for the flavors to really sink in.  I brought some leftovers to my father and he couldn't get enough of it!

Delicious but cut way back on the oil and salt. Double the recipe for a crockpot main dish. Brown just the onions for 5 minutes in 2 tablespoons of EVO and toss in the crockpot with the head of chopped cabbage. In addition to the carrots add other veggies you have around and optional chicken or tofu or sausage.  Doubled makes 10 servings that can be stored in containers for lunches or dinners in the refrigerator.

Loved this. I don't usually eat cabbage but it was on sale at the grocery store. I googled cabbage recipes and this recipe came up. What a wonderful surprise. Excellent flavours. I would eat this every night if I could. I doubled the spices as suggested (not the salt) and it was so tasty. I made it with a piece of baked salmon with the same spices sprinkled on top. Excellent combination.

I thought this was a 3 star recipe as written but would give it 4 stars using other readers' suggestions. I tripled the spices and added crushed red pepper and freshly grated ginger and will confess to using a little chipotle infused olive oil. I reversed the order of cooking potatoes and cabbage and both were done well. It was even better the next day.  Doubt I will be making this again since there are too many 5 star recipes out there.

I doubled the spices (except for the salt) and added a little bit of onion powder and garlic powder. This came out SO good! Will definitely be making it again!

This is soooo good, I cut back a little on the olive oil and it did not hurt it.  The second time I made it I did add some garlic, I loved it both ways, it is so good as a side dish too, and if u want to make it a main dish.... add some grated cheese to it and bake it for a bit.

This is one of my favorite Ethiopian dishes and I am pleasantly surprised at how EASY & QUICK it is to make. Like the other reviewers, I doubled all the spices. I also wanted to more cabbage (maybe I bought I small one) the first time I made it and used a whole cabbage. So happy to add this in to our dinner rotation!

OMG!!! So easy and soooo testy...so much flavor. My daughter doesn't touch vegetables...today she asked for seconds. This will be a regular in our house. With the exception of the olive oil ( used only 1/4 cup) I follow the recipe. Next time I will added some garlic...I love garlic and is very healthy.
Thank you Stamarex!!!!

This is so easy and cheap to make. I use more potatoes and carrots and a whole head of cabbage, plus I add two chopped up cloves of garlic. I put in about a teaspoon of berbere instead of the spices, but sometimes for spicy evenings I'll add two teaspoons. It goes great with injera or with sliced Kielbasa or turkey sausage. I've made this about four or five times now because it is a perpetual favorite during the winter season. This feeds our family of six and there is usually leftovers.

I thought the spice combo for the recipe was right on - loved the flavor! But I prefer to make the potatoes crispy in the oven first and then just stir them in with the cabbage before serving so that there is a variety in the texture.

This is really yummy.  I doubled the spices like everyone else.  I agree with prior reviewer I think the potatoes should be added first.  I reserved some cabbage to add at the end and I think that reall helped.  I will make this again, everyone but my 2 year old loves it.

This was so, so easy and so, so tasty! I originally intended to make it ahead of time and pair it with the Ethiopian Chicken recipe on allrecipes, but the family ate it all before I could and begged me to make another batch for the very next night. The only change I made was doubling the spices, but I'm definitely going to follow the recommendations of other reviewers and toss some garlic and ginger in next time.

Had all the ingredients on hand and whipped this up for dear wife for lunch.  Was looking for something to do with cabbage and this was the bill.  Seldom do we have a meatless meal it seems and I warned the missus that we would be doing vegan.  We both enjoyed this dish and are glad to have a new way to fix cabbage.  Served it with butter beans... a good match.

Wow, this recipe is stunning. Like others, I didn't have turmeric on hand and wanted to try it out, so I subbed red wine vinegar like suggested in these comments, doubled the cumin and added about four cloves of minced garlic. 

I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it is beautiful. I made a huge pot planning to have leftovers, but I can't stop eating it so I'm worried I'll polish off the whole thing! Just so tasty and comforting without being too heavy, and the flavours of all the veggies run together nicely. Great recipe, and very easy to make while puttering around the house.

This was wonderful! I made as written, the best test I think. I might experiment with seasoning next time. I used the leftovers today for lunch by adding chicken broth to make a soup and added some curry power, it was a hit again. I have now made this multiple times, my family likes it with potatoes unpeeled, and 1 tsp of turmeric - which is very good for you..,

My husband took one look at the name of this and was not thrilled...until he tried it and couldn't stop talking about how tasty it was.  I added some minced garlic, and a little extra cumin and turmeric.  Will definitely make it again.  This is an easy recipe to cut in half as well.

We loved this recipe so much I made it four times in two weeks!
I did double the spices except salt & Pepper, and halved the oil.
The recipe holds a place on the fridge.  Very inexpensive (potatoes & cabbage) and lo fat too!

Everyone is right about doubling the spices. Using a skillet to prepare the meal was a bit challenging, but I made it work...will use a larger pot next time to ensure all potatoes are cooked through. Overall a very nice dish.

This is my new favorite thing! We gobbled it up. I added half the oil, twice the spices.  Used hing as well.  I thinly sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them and I had to add some water to keep it from burning/sticking.  I paired it with mesir wat (red lentils), some quinoa, and a yogurt sauce with cucumber, cilantro, mint, cumin, and salt.

I followed the directions , aside from halving the oil, adding 2 teaspoons minced garlic, and doubling the spices. The flavor was great! My only "complaint" is that I felt the potatoes were too distracting. I will decrease the quantity next time.

We loved it!  Recently we adopted a vegatarian lifestyle and this recipe cooks up like a stew, but without meat.  It's hearty, flavorful and satisfying.

Others recommended more spice; but I found the mix to be perfect and more would have been too spicy, my hubby agreed.  I did add an extra potato and last minute I added a can of green beans which added a nice color and flavor.

I thank you I will making this recipe often!

This was much more delicious than I hoped that it would be, I have never heard of Ethiopian cuisine, as it is not avalible in my country. I used half a cabbage in case it was a bad recipe, but I am going to use the other half like this as well. I added some garlic, ginger, and cinnamon. It was not hot, so next time I am going to add some red pepper as well.

Delicious!  I didn't have any carrots so I left them out.  I did add about a 1/2 cup of water to get the potatoes cooked.  I used red cabbage so it was really pretty too!  Will definitely have to make again.

Not really that good in my opinion. I would have given this 2 stars but I made it a second time and used less cabbage which then bumped it up to 3 stars.

I make many things for my family and most of the time they have some type of change I should make to better the recipe.  However, this recipe made the cut!  They agreed no changes were needed :-)  THANK YOU! it was nice to finally hear all positive and nothing that needed to be changed!

I cut the olive oil as suggested by other reviewers and skipped the turmeric because I didn't have any on hand. This is a nice cabbage recipe. My 15 y/o even liked it.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I found it when I was searching for recipes for a vegan fast.  This was by far my favorite.  I doubled the spice, as others suggested.  The first time I made it with balsamic vinagrette because I didn't have tumeric on hand and it was fabulous as well.   Thank you for the addition!

This is really good!  I cooked this recipe  as directed.  I agree with the comments that 1/2 Cup of oil is too much.  I'll only use 1/4 next time. Also I would double  seasonings as others have suggested.  I don't know why people add meat, such as  diced ham, to this recipe.  It tastes great as a veggie side dish.

In my opinion, this is one of the best recipes I have found on this site. The first time I made it, I made it according to the recipe, and it was a hit.  But now I add extra of all the seasonings, and it rates off-the charts. Don't worry if you have more or less of any of the veges. Tonight I had about 3/4 head of cabbage that was ready to be used, and it was DELISH! In fact, I think that from now on I will always use more cabbage if I have it. AND... if you are making it for a few people, I strongly suggest that you double the recipe, as my adult daughter and I polished off nearly the whole dish tonight... just the 2 of us. The leftovers are going to work with her tomorrow for lunch.

this is not necessarily a dish i would crave, but was good for using up my potatoes and cabbage.  I doubled the seasonings as reccommended, and thought the flavor was good.  i prefer my vegies to have a bit of body left to them, so i won't be cooking this dish nearly as long next time.

This has become an absolute favorite cabbage dish we 'crave' in this household.  I've prepared this dish exactly as decribed and although it really doesn't need any alterations from the original recipe, I've also added additional seasonings such as garlic & seasoning salt in place of the sea salt.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor, but it takes longer than 30 mins to cook the potatoes--well, for me it did. More like 45 mins, unless you chop the potatoes really small. Otherwise, great dish!! I'll have a lot of leftovers and will serve over rice tomorrow. Thanks!

As is, this rates a 4, but with modifications a 5. I agree with previous reviewers: Reduce oil to 1/4 c., double the spices (salt to taste), add garlic clove. I made the mistake of reversing the order of the cabbage and potatoes -- will put them in at the same time. Definitely will make this again, though have to add meat (perhaps a smoked sausage) for family.

This is a delicious dish.  For the most flavor, be sure to cook each part the recommended length of time.

Delicious with turkey keilbasa!  Doubled all the spices (next time I will not double black pepper for it got too spicy for my family, even though I liked it).  Easy and great!

Loved the flavor! I doubled the tumeric only. Next time I'll add the potatoes a little sooner because I would have liked the cabbage to have been slightly more crisp and not so wilted from overcooking. I'll also use slightly less olive oil.

My children(9,6 & 5 yrs old) & husband gave this a '10'.
I am Irish and while I'll eat cabbage, potatoes and corned beef on and around St. Pat's I was looking for something different. I will make this again and again.  I've sent it to my sister and Mom back in Dublin and expect some more rave reviews.  Thanks very much!

Fully satisfied,
Darina

This was really delicious and filling.  I added some keibasa, which added a nice taste and texture, and used Yukon Gold 'taters, which held up well and didn't get mushy.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

Dish was a delight. I had never used tumeric before when i tasted the dish i was like this needs  more. So i added about the 3 times the listed amount of dry ingredients. I also put my potatoes in with the cabbage. I used an enamel cast iron dutch oven on very low heat and everything cooked evenly.

I loved this recipe, except that 1/2 cup of oil was a bit much. Try to reduce the oil and it would be perfect.  You can add other vegetables, I added fresh spinach,& garlic.

Awesome.  Big casserole dish, not skillet, double spices except for salt, add two 15oz cans of chickpeas.  Oh, and about a tablespoon each of fresh garlic and ginger.

My daughter and I loved this dish.  She rarely likes cabbage except in chinese food.  I  doubled the cumin and the turmeric as suggested by others.  This was a fantastic side dish with corned beef.  I will make this again and my daughter is making it tonight for a belated St. Patricks day feast.

Fantastic!  Although I used slightly more ingredients (cabbage, carrot, potatoes and onion) I needed to double the spices, especially the salt.  But then it turned out just fantastic!  Will be making this again.

I've made this for years and it's perfect as written.  I know other reviewers have suggested garlic, but I think that would overwhelm the other spices and turn this into a completely different dish.

Don't double the salt!!  I missed that tip and it was a bit too salty.  But I do recommend doubling the rest of the spices.  It wasn't overpowering, a subtle sweet flavor.

This was an excellent dish and glad that I tried it.  I had been looking for different ways to cook cabbage and after trying this recipe, it will become stable in my kitchen.  Per other reviews, I doubled the spices, which was great.  My potatoes took longer to cook and then some of them were only half cooked.  Next time I think I will cook the potatoes separately then add them in at the end.

This is a nice dish.  I use either Ghee or Clarified butter rather than oil.  Also...if you are serving on injera you realy need the whole 1/2 cup because the injera really soaks it up.  Yes, double the spices (except the salt.)

Very tasty side dish alongside a beef roast.  Even my husband went back for seconds.  My only complaint is that the potatoes were still tough after cooking an extra 10 minutes and it would have been a little bland if I hadn't doubled the spices.

It was so good!  I doubled the spices, and they were perfect. But even though I had it on medium low I still burned it. In the future I will probably add a little splash of water when I add the potatoes and keep it on true low, not medium low.

Excellent dish!  I brought it to an Ethiopian themed dinner and was pleased with the results.  I reduced the olive oil by half and doubled the spices.  What a great blend of spices (and not too spicy)...I'd definitely have this dish again.

This was very good!!! I added a little bit more pepper to mine because i love pepper. The aroma of this meal is very hypnotic and will make everyone hungry. I'm rating this four stars only because it took me waaaaaaaay more than 25 minutes of prep time.

I would agree with other reviews, need to cut the olive oil in half and double spices. Delicious! Definitely will make this again!

This turned out great.  I doubled the spices and added garlic and ginger.  I also substituted veggie broth for the olive oil.

Overall, not a bad dish.  Just not great.  It was a bit bland.  I think I will take another rater's advice and kick up the spices the next time I prepare this dish.  I like the novelty of it though.

This is DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't really obey the measurments for the spices. I just added them to my liking. I added salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and bell peppers since I like spicy foods. I also cooked the potatoes seperately to speed up time. It wasn't bland, as others stated. You just really have to add the extra flavor to give it that kick. LOVED this dish!!!!

Super tasty, great use of fall harvest veggies.  I only used enough oil to cook the onions/carrots, not the full amt suggested by the recipe.  I also doubled the spices with much success.  Lastly, I used purple potatoes which lent a fantastic third color to the palette next to the yellow and orange.  I've made it twice now -- highly recommended!

We truly enjoyed this dish.  We eat cabbage quite often and it was a nice change to how I normally cook it.  Plus, you can add/subtract spices per personal tastes very easily so depending on what we are eating it with determines how much/little we add.

Excellent!  I think I'd chop the potatoes even smaller than 1 inch pieces, and I might add a bit more seasoning, but the recipe is excellent as is, too. Oh, and I used only canola oil spray vs. the huge amount of oil it called for, and the recipe was still excellent!

I was looking for something different to do with the cabbage from my garden.  My son was just talking about some Ethiopian food he'd had, so this one caught my eye.  I LOVED it!  The flavors were so different than what I usually make, but not overpowering.  Next time, I'm going to make it with less potatoes (or maybe none) as I'm not a huge potato fan and would rather have more carrots and cabbage.  Thanks!

This has become a staple in our house. My mom loves it and says it tastes exactly like the one from our favorite Ethiopian place. I added Coriander, nutmeg, butter & a touch of cloves and it made it taste even more authentic to me. But the dish if fab as is written. I just always like extra spices. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Although I'm not very good cook, this is a pretty easy dish to make, cheap, and nutritious.  I'm not usually a cabbage fan and even I thought it tastes great.  Overall a winner in every way.  I bought a chopped cabbage/carrot mix from Sam's Club which saved some prep time.  I did increase the amount of spices as suggested by others here and thought it turned out well.

Used just a little olive oil in a large non-stick skillet. Didn't have potatoes, but it's delicious without.

Very good. Used balsamic vinegar in place of tumeric and used shredded carrots. Easy dish to make and very healthy.  I also cut down on the olive oil.

I loved this recipe! I don't generally like the flavor of cumin so I reduced it by 1/2 but was still a little nervous about trying it. In the end I was so pleased with the dish. I served it as a main dish but then realized there is absolutely no protein in it, so made sure to drink milk with it. Can someone suggest a good protein side or main dish to complement this?

This is SUPER yum!!!  We added finely chopped cooked chicken left over from last night (about a cup) and that gave it a rich chewy texture layer.

This is an outstanding recipe, but like the others, I had to add more spices because I found it to be a bit bland.  I thought maybe it was bland because there was too much cabbage (perhaps).  Next time I make this, I will use less cabbage (maybe a third).  I think the spices should be adjusted according to one's taste.  I will continue making this recipe.  The flavour was unbelievable!  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect as is. I could not beleive even my parents (who are very meat-and-potatos people, who claim never to like anything with different spices) loved it. Not too spicey - just really perfect.

I love this recipe!!! I was trying to become a vegertarian earlier this year and I came across this dish and I was hooked! I like to kick up the spices just a bit, but that's just my preference. This is now my favorite way to cook cabbage.

Very tasty. I halved the recipe and kept the amount of spices (thus doubling the spices, like most folks recommended). Now that I know that it's good, I plan to serve this with a Dorowat (spicy Ethiopian chicken) and Alicha Wat (lentils and Ethiopian spices).

Amazing. It reminds me a lot of Indian food, which I also love. I used roughly fist-sized potatoes, heaped the spices, and used only 1/4 cup of olive oil. Tried it and loved it; for dinner, I cooked and added boneless/skinless chicken breasts cut into strips. This was the first time I've ventured into Ethiopian cooking; I'd love to find out the actual name of the dish. I'll definitely be passing this one on to friends and family.
