This recipe was really good and so simple to make. The only adjustment i made was to use the glaze from the "apple cranberry stuffed pork chops".  The glaze combines apple juice, corn starch and brown sugar.  The glaze ensures that your pork chops wont be dry and adds a little more sweetness to the recipe.  The only other thing i would add would be to adjust the baking time depending on the thickness of your pork chops.  I only baked mine for 25 minutes vs. the 40 minutes it calls for in the recipe.

This is the best pork chop recipe I have tried in a long time.  My hubby bought some  really thick bone-in chops and we wanted to try something different.  The balsamic in this intrigued me.  I almost doubled the filling for the 3 huge chops I used.  I cooked it covered for about 50 minutes then uncovered for 10....there was still a good bit of juice in the bottom so I cooked it on the stove top to reduce it a bit and added a small squirt of Dijon mustard to it.  Served the sauce over the chops and my favorite Brazilian White Rice (Thanks Nanda).  WE had a fantastic dinner.  My hubby and I both want the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks Valerie!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband told me that it was the best meal i've ever cooked.  I added some garlic and chopped almonds to the apple mix but other than that I followed the recipe exactly

I absolutely love this recipe and my husband requested it again two days after I first made it! First off, I'm not a pork chops fan which is why I was looking for a different way of making them - after this recipe I now actually crave the things! I followed the directions exactly except I also seasoned the prok chops with a little thyme and I only had a red delicious apple so I used that. It was amazing! I was in a hurry and I had very thick pork chops so I cooked them for 25 minutes at 425 and they were juicy and all the way cooked. Perfect recipe to impress others, thanks for sharing this one!

Wow, what an amazing recipe. Instead of chops I made the stuffing into a roast. I made slits in the pork and stuffed it into the spaces, I then placed it in a pot with a lid and baked in the oven for a few hours...depending on the size of the roast! When I served it to my husband and our guests, they couldn't stop eating it! Pork turned out tender, falling apart and was just filled with flavour! Definitely will make it over and over..Yum, Yum!

I almost didn't make this recipe as I saw that some comments stated that it "lacked flavor".  I'm glad I decided to make it anyways because it was very flavor full.  I chilled the apple mixture for almost an hour to ensure that the flavors had time to come together.  I also grilled the pork chops and then heated the apple mixture on the stove top and served it on top of the pork chop to make sure the meat was not dried out.

Absolutly wonderful. Wasnt to overwhelming or sweet like i thought it might be. Only thing i might change is cutting the slit then browning and then stuffing them. Might also cook at a lower temp next time. Over all great recipe one i will cook for years to come. Thank you bunches.

I loved the taste of these pork chops and will make them again.  Next time I won't brown them in the frying pan.  I think it just added calories, and really didn't see that it improved anything.  I cooked for 35 minutes, but it was too long. Next time I'll skip the frying pan, and cook them for 30-35 minutes and see how the come out.

i am disappointed. I followed the pork chop exactly and the pork turned out dry and tasteless (I should had seasoned it!!!). I put it on rice and some veggie, but there is no sauce to it...
anyhow...I think it would be better if I make a sauce for this ...cool idea with adding the cranberry though

Made this last night trying to wow my hubby-I thought it was really pretty good. Wasn't quite "to die for" like I was expecting, but it was still very tasty. A little tart and different, and makes a nice presentation for a meal. I even broke out the wedding china for this one.

I made this for boyfriend for our first San Valentine and he was delighted. He can't stop raving about such a Chef that I am with everybody including his mother. I truly believe I won him over with this and it was so simple and such a great recipe. I served it with the Simple Waldorf Salad and Seafood Stuffed Avocados and was more than a hit. I know this will always be our special meal. Thanks!!!

Really enjoyed this recipe! I normally do the cooking but was working late so gave hubby the details to cook it up. He accidentally grabbed Gala apples (he is not the main cook/shopper & didnt know what granny smith apples meant lol) anyway....turned out just great!!!!

delicious and very moist! My husband said it was one of my best recipes! I changed it some by using cranberries and golden raisens, sprinkle of crumbled blue cheese and toasted walnuts. Will make it again.

Excellent recipe. Prepared these chops exactly as written, and they were moist and very flavorful. I was a bit skeptical when I got done sauteing the apple mixture, but after it was stuffed in the chops and baked, it was so good, and made excellent juice in the bottom of the baking dish. As some of the other users recommended, I used thick cut chops and that helps with having enough room to stuff them.

Made this for dinner last night. I cut the slit in the pork chops and browned them off. When colled I stuffed the chops and cooked for about 35 minutes. I also used olive oil cooking spray to cook the apple cranberry mixture as well as the chops, this reduces the fat. This recipe was easy to follw and tasted great, I am going to try this next time with chicken in place of the pork. Thank you Valerie.

For someone who "doesn't cook" this recipe is fantastic! It was so tender, so delicious and SO EASY!! This Easter will be the first family dinner I am hosting at my house so I have decided to make these pork chops instead of the traditional ham.

This recipe was great, I changed it a little simply because I didn't have some of the ingredients. 

I used currants instead of cranberry and I forgot I had no onion so I used onion powder. I added a pinch of cinnamon and some dried thyme. I mixed the onion powder, cinnamon, thyme, garlic salt and a touch of pepper over the apples before I cooked them. I also added garlic to cook with the apples. 

I rubbed the pork chops with butter first, just a bit and then I mixed some salt pepper and thyme and rubbed it on both sides and let them sit in the fridge well te apple mix was cooling. I also had center loin chop about an inch thick so I just pounded them to about a half inch thick.  I only had to cook for thirty minutes for 4 and they came out wonderful, juicy and some juice left over in the bottom to drip over them and the potatoes. 

Was a big hit and will definitely have this as a recipie for years to come. LOVE IT!!!!

Freaking delicious!  Thank you!  We used very thin chops, pounded them out more and rolled the stuffing up, same cook time and they were slightly over done.

Wonderful recipe.  We butterflied the pork chops and fried them in the pan with the stuffing and saved about 20 minutes.

This was very good and easy to make.  I made a few modifications which I think added to the taste and flavor.  I added approx. a 1/4 cup of sherry to the stuffing mixture after it had cooked 10 minutes, and cooked it an additional few minutes.  I also brushed the pork chops with an egg and milk mixture and dipped them in bread crumbs prior to frying.  I think this helped keep them a little more moist and the bread crumbs added a nice flavor.

I had 4, 8oz chops & 30 mins w/ cover & 10 off was too much -- chops were tough & dry : (  I will try again because the flavors of the apple/cranberry mixture were yummy!  I'll reduce baking time to 20 mins w/ cover, 10 w/out next time

I've made this recipe twice & we love it. The pork chop comes out very moist & apple/cranberry mixture is yummy. I was in a rush so skipped the refrigerator part & it was still tasty. Definitely a favorite!

Good taste, but notes say it was time-consuming and lots of clean-up.

I cut a slit in my chops and brined them for 3 hours before stuffing, searing, and baking. Turned out delicious, hubs and I both loved them. Extremely moist and tasty.Had a touch of juice in pan 
after baking, just dribbled it over top of chops. This one is a keeper. I will continue to brine beforehand.

Pork tenderloin in crockpot variation:  I used 2-1/2 lb tenderloin, 2 large Gala apples, 1 can vegetable stock, and a can of whole berry cranberry sauce (no dried cranberries on hand). I followed Step 1 with the oil, onions and apples and then put it in the crockpot.  I made 3 cuts into the top of the tenderloin, seasoned and seared as in Step 3, then put it in the crockpot and added a can of vegetable stock. Covered and cooked on high for 2 hours. I stirred up the cranberry sauce to break it up a bit, then spooned it on the top of the pork, covered and cooked for another 30 minutes.  
It turned out fantastic!  My kids (2&5) LOVED it and my husband (who thinks the only reason pigs exist is for bacon) enjoyed it as well.  The little piece that was leftover for lunch today was even tastier! The only change I would make is to hold off adding the apples until maybe an hour into cooking; sauteing them with the onions made them way too soft when served hot, but they had a nice texture with the leftovers.  I even diced them a bit larger so they wouldn't turn to mush (which they didn't, but they disintegrated when I bit into them). Easy recipe and I'm glad that I could convert it to a tenderloin in the crockpot!

Very quick prep.  I used pears because of an allergy to apples. I used less vinegar because I didn't think they could handle so much vinegar. I used chops thinner than I wanted so I reduced the bake time. Everyone liked them so  I think it was a hit.  Very tasty.

I  took a different spin on the stuffed pork chop. I made a layered stuffed chop. I had four thin pork chops that I pan fried  then took them  out of the skillet and cooked the onion apple cranberry mixture. Then I stuffed the pork chops by making a boxed stuffing mix. I lined a baking sheet with parchment paper and divided the stuffing into 4 piles on the sheet. Then I took 8 oz of spinach and lightly sautéed in the same pan I had cooked the cran apple mixture in. I squeezed out the moisture and layered the spinach on the stuffing. Next I layered most of the cran apple mixture on the spinach then topped with the pork chop. I sprinkled the remaining cran apple mixture on top and baked for 30 mins.

My husband really loved this. I had everything except the dried cranberries, but I had fresh cranberries, so I cooked those down with sugar, then added part to the sautéed apple & onion, put apple juice, & brown sugar in the leftover cooked cranberries, mixed a little cornstarch with some apple juice & thickened it to make a glaze. I sprinkled the pork chops with salt, fresh ground pepper & a little thyme, browned them in butter, then stuffed them, put the glaze on them, covered and baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes, then uncovered and let them cook another 10 minutes. Tender, Juicy & Delicious!

I was looking for a similar stuffed pork chop recipe but  after I tried this recipe I'd say this was a much better recipe with tastier outcome ?? My husband was impressed with it (and he has a discerning taste) and so the recipe will be on our rotation. I followed the recipe to the letter except I used frozen cranberries which I thawed before cooking with the rest of the ingredients and turned out wonderful. The reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 was that  I was expecting the pork chop itself to be juicer . Perhaps if I use bone-in pork chop that would make the difference?

I followed the recipe and made no changes.  My crew didn't rave over it.  I asked them what they thought and they said it was o.k.  It was easy enough to make.

Very good!  40 minutes plus 10 minutes is too long though--our pork was a little dry.  My chops were 1 3/4 inch thick--very big.   I added thyme and sage to the apple mixture--not too much, but gave it a nice complexity.  I'll make it again!  Very easy, and can be prepared in advance.
