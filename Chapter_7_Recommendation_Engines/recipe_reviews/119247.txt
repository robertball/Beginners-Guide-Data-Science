Wow, this was awesome!  However, I did make some changes.  I only had beef tri-tip steaks, and they worked fine.  Wanted to have a thicker, richer sauce, so I added some sour cream (about 2-3 tsp) and thickened it with cornstarch mixture.  I didn't have a dry red wine, so I used a burgundy cooking wine.  It was so good, my son ate his ALL - and he doesn't even like steak!!  Or he DIDN'T before I made this!  Try the sour cream addition.  Along with the red wine/burgundy, it give it a strogonoff sort of flavor.  YUM!

I thought the sauce was great with this! Beef broth, wine, and mushrooms can't be beat for a sauce! But, I did have to add at least 1 Tblsp of butter at the end, because it was way too thin. I used an almost similar cut of meat as the recipe, but it was too tough. I would like to try this again with a "very tender" cut of meat with the same sauce and the added butter.

I did not cook the meat as directed in this recipe, so this review is solely for the sauce. I made this sauce to accompany my "Herb rubbed sirloin tip roast" recipe from this site and the sauce was beautiful. However, next time i might add some Thyme to simmer during the reduction  and be more generous with the mushrooms. They absorb so much delicious flavor. Also, i sauteed in butter for added flavor and used a strong beef broth to increase flavor because I wanted to add about 1/4 c half and half to make the sauce creamy without diluting the flavor. whisked in some flour at the end to thicken slights. Big success!

We thought this was great!  It is so quick and simple to make, and the presentation really looks nice.  It would be a great recipe to make for company.  I didn't need to add any additional seasonings as the wine-beef broth-mushroom sauce adds a wonderful flavor.  I prefer a slightly thicker sauce, so I added 1 tsp cornstarch into some cool beef broth and stirred that into the sauce until it thickened.  I'll be making this again.

This dish was very easy and fast to prepare and was really good.  The boyfriend loved it!  I didn't have beef broth or red wine so I used Lipton's Onion Soup mix and some random other ingredients and it turned out great!

Very good sauce.  Used a whole package of mushrooms, beef broth and Chianti wine.  Added a very little amount of starch per other reviews but I don't think it helped as much as just letting the sauce reduce.  I chose not to cook the mushrooms prior to adding the other two ingredients but let them all work together at once it turned out great.  Will probably try this with other cuts of beef

Delicious! So tasty! I halved this recipe for my husband and I. The only change I made was an addition of Kosher salt to the meat before I browned it on the stove. The sauce was very runny and I wanted to add cornstarch like the others suggested, but I forgot. I served it with a french roll and butter. Wish I had salad or another side with it. The sauce was the consistency of wine or broth, but don't let it fool you, it was delicious!

It was incredibly easy to make and it has a great taste. We had company for dinner and they couldn't believe it was so simple to make. We love it and have repeated the recipe a few more times. Excellent!

Taste was good, but I could not get the flour/water mixtures to blend into the mushrooms/wine properly.  I kep getting flour lumps that wouldn't break up....they created little dumplings!  I'll try using cornstarch in leiu of the the flour mixture next time, because the taste was great!

Made this for a small piece of veal sirloin I had. I think it's important to mention that this sirloin was raised in a pasture and also organic, raised on a farm 30 miles from my house. I definitely think this had something to do with how good this recipe was. First, I had the meat warm to room temperature. Next, I started cooking my mushrooms in the olive oil for just a short time before I added the beef base (I didn't have beef broth). I only used 1 cup of beef base with the mushrooms and then threw in a pinch of onion and garlic powder. I also used some corn starch to thicken up the sauce. I pretty much cooked the sirloin the same way, but had to adjust the cooking time. I put it in the oven for 3 minutes, then flipped it for another 3. It was perfectly tender...almost like it melted in your mouth! I also served this with a white sweet potato and kale sauteed with fresh garlic and a baked Braeburn apple as dessert. Yum!

Everything was fine, but my sirloin steak was very chewy...wondering if I should use a differnt kind?  My husband and I are on a sodium restricted diet so I used water, wine and low-salt worcheshire sauce.  Came out great.  Now if I can just get the steak rightt.  :o)

I think this needed a little more flavor. Could be maybe a little more wine or a better beef broth on my end. Still, very easy and definitely brought a little something extra than A-1. I think next time I may try to thicken it up just a little bit.

This recipe is wonderful and simple. Like most of the other reviews I used a tsp of corn starch to thicken but not very much. My adjustments to the recipe were: added thinly sliced onions with the mushrooms; just beef broth and a little Worcestershire. My son and I are trying to eat healthier so served with steamed green beans and baked sweet potatoes.

this is a very very good dish the sauce is a little thin and i tried to use milk butter flour and other items but it never thickened up. its also a little bland and i couldnt figure out what to put in it to kick it up a little bit id ont like anything spicy so it makes it a little bit complicated to find something to spice it up so to speak. but i did put 1/2cup of butter in it and a some s-n-p but once again it is a good dish i would just would have like to have the shrooms to have a lttle bit more of a taste

This has a very good flavor.  Picked up sirloin from "manager's special" bin.  Used the suggestion of adding corn starch to thicken sauce.  Also added a little salt.  My husband really liked it.  Great meal that was good enough for company, but inexpensive.

I grilled a London Broil and made this sauce to go with it. I like it as it is low fat and my daughter can have it. I have to say this is an awesome recipe. 
I used cremini and white mushrooms and followed the recipe with the exception of the steak. I added a tiny bit of salt and pepper. Don't think it was needed.
I used Campbells Beef broth and a Merlot. I loved it and so did everyone else. We even put it on our baked potatoes. Definitely a keeper.

I did not care for the sauce. I used a good quality wine too. I'm sure it is great for some, just not for my taste buds! :)

This steak was perfect.  I did replace the red wine with white wine because it's what I had on hand, and it made a nice light sauce.  I want to try this again with a bolder red wine.  Really easy to make and very good.
