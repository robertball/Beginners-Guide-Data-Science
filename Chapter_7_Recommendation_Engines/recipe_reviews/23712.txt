I am English & I grew up on "Bubble & Squeak", [recipe for which will be submited shortly].  The Bubble is the what it does, the Squeak is what is heard.  There is NEVER any sausage in it.  It was a way of using up leftovers & is normally a breakfast side dish. English breakfast consists of: Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Baked Beans [not USA kind], Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Fried Bread, some people add Black Pudding but not me...

I grew up calling this Ukranian (or maybe Polish) dish "halushki", and it was made with bacon pieces and fried in bacon grease.  It's fabulous this way!

No, no no! Pasta? Sausage? You're stomping on the glorious British tradition of creating marvellous, heart-clogging messy soul-food recipes, then giving them names that evoke a dog's dinner. So please call this dish something else. However, if you add some garlic and red pepper flakes, you might be onto something.

My, what a poor little beleaguered recipe.  Although slightly different, it's not that much different from a dish bf really likes.  I think his grandmother made it all the time.  He calls it Cabbage and Noodles, though, so maybe that would make the naming police around here happy? ;o) I must say that this makes a lot of cabbage and noodles, and I halved the pasta amount.  Cabbage is big.  I thought it would cook down, and it did.  Sort of.  But unless you have a monster huge skillet and 10 mouths to feed, you might want to try halving this recipe.  Or quartering it.  I don't have a monster huge skillet and everything was spilling out of my biggest skillet.   So I spent half my time picking up cabbage and noodles from the floor, stove, and counter.  If you really want to be like me, I suppose you could and I'll take it as a compliment.  ;o)  Still, I'd reccomend a monster huge skillet or big pot for a full recipe of this.  I'm not a fan of bf's cabbage and noodles, but he bought a cabbage at the farmer's market and it needed used.  It's funny how he buys things I don't like and I end up cooking them to get them out of my fridge . . .but I digress.  Back to cabbage & noodles.  Yes, it's bland as written.  Bf complained that I didn't fry bacon and then cook the cabbage in the bacon grease.  Which is apparently what Grandma does.  So try that and see if it's more to your taste.  Other than that, bf ate it.  So I'm happy.  He's happy.  Let's all be happy!  Thanks for the recipe!

The reason this dish is so bland is that the sausage is left out.  This is an English recipe that I have had several times in England and it is really good with the sausage.  The cabbage is the "bubble" and the sausage is the "squeak".

Bubbles & Squeak has cabbage, mashed potatoes, onions and lots of butter in it and is very delicious! I thought I'd give this recipe a try and it was very bland.

This dish by itself was alright, adding mozzarella cheese and sausage made it quite tasty though!

Originally an English dish (Bubble and Squeak) and the name comes from the sounds the ingrdients make while cooking or your stomach noises after eating it.  It isn't my favorite dish but this recipe IS better than the original THANKS

Bubble and bland is what this should be called. I thought maybe I could be pleasantly suprised with this dish but was unpleasantly disgusted. Horrible, just horrible.

The name comes from the noise it makes as it cooks. I grew up with this dish in England. The original recipe does not use pasta it is mashed potatoes that are used.

Very bland,I wasn't sure what to do to spice it up because of the sweetness of the cabbage.  The whole family made me promise to not make this again.
