After struggling with many "homemade" sugar cookie recipes, I finally broke down and bought this store mix.  Not only was this cookie great tasting, the dough was a dream to work with - even without refrigerating it first! I did have to increase the cooking time a couple of extra minutes because I used larger (3") cookie cutters.  I'm throwing out my other sugar cookie recipies and sticking with this one from now on!
