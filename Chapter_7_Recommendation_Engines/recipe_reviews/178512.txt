This was my first try at cooking rabbit and this recipe was wonderful. It is so aromatic and flavorful. After simmering for an hour, I thickened it with 2 teaspoons corn starch mixed with 2 tablespoons water. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Thank you Joely!

This is an easy and good recipe for rabbit. My rabbits are usually around 5lbs dressed and I would recommend tripling the vegetables, and doubling all other ingredients when you have a larger rabbit.

Marinade the rabbit for a few hours even overnight, in wine, lots of garlic and onions. Fry rabbit as above and use marinade in the stew too. Enjoy. ymmmmm

Very nice recipe, which I suspect would work just as well with any kind of meat.. We happened to have a rabbit  -- a Snowshoe Hare my son got while bird hunting birds. Didn't use a bay leaf because I didn't have any, and used eight carrots instead of two, and also used one of those little cups of bouillon instead of a cube. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Sea salt and good cracked black peppercorns probably helped, too. It was delicious, and dipping some locally made bread in the broth was very tasty. It's kind of labor intensive but worth the effort;  I'd give it five stars.

The recipe is very similar to my grandmothe'rs (minus the fresh rabbit taken from the villa's rooftop cages). This brought back a lot of memories. Unfortunately, I seemed to have bought a tough rabbit that came out a little dry. Otherwise it was as good as I remembered from childhood. Next time will let it cook in wine a little longer before adding starches.

Good. Was the first time preparing rabbit for me. Didn't have a dutch oven big enough, so I browned the pieces in a skillet and put them in a roaster. After browning the meat, I poured the red wine in the pan to get all of the brown bits off then added that to the roaster along with all of the other ingredients (plus a little water). Roasted it for an hour and it came out great.

I wasnt a fan of this recipe i found the wine overpowered the stew and I also found it too watery, I always thought stews were supposed to be on the thicker side. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 2 or 3 stars was

Great recipe. It was an experience skinning and cleaning my son's first rabbit and then cleaning it together! Big fun. Thanks for this tasty recipe. I added the corn starch/water (2tsp/2tbsp) at the end. Served with buttermilk biscuits. I didn't have nutmeg so I used a little basil for kicks. Family loved it.

I created a profile just to write this review and say how good the rabbit stew was. Thanks to everyone who reviewed it in the comments; when someone says a dish is just like their grandmother's it's usually a guarantee that the recipe works. We used chicken broth instead of the beef-flavored cube; worked out just fine.

Had this dish today at a school party -- it was delicious! My first taste of rabbit.  Very tasty, the seasoning was perfect.  I will definitely make this for a family meal.
