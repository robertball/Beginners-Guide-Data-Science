My girlfriend had given me a fruit cocktail recipe a few months back but it just wasn't coming out right whenever I baked it. I decided to search the site and saw this recipe. I baked it on Christmas day this cake is SLAMMING. When my husband keeps going back for more you know its good. I bake an extra one and took it to work and it was gone in no time. Very very good. I will definitely keep this one and throw out the one my girlfriend gave me. Thanks

This is a GREAT cake. I made a few modifications. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the "cake". I didn't have evaporated milk for the topping so I used sweetened condensed milk and omitted the sugar. It was fabulous--my family loved it. Definitely a "keeper".

This has to be the easiest recipe to follow and the best cake we have ever eaten! I added extra coconut and nuts because I can not get enough of those ingredients. The topping is just as wonderful as the cake. A very old fashioned flavor. Love it!

Excellent taste although very rich. I thought a 9X13 dish would last a long time... Ha!... Not at our house! Thanks Nannie

Very similar to my "family" recipe. Quick to mix together & get in the pan. Didn't use the nuts but added a few handsful of crushed cornflakes to the topping. Hubby loved it & we will take some to the neighbor's tonight-I know she's going to ask for the recipe!

Turned out fantastic! I cooked the cake in a 9x9 inch pan and made 6 cupcakes out of the rest. Topping was great and the neighbors loved the cupcakes while we snarfed the cake Thanks for sharing!

This has potential. Far to much butter in the "glaze" topping. Far too much baking soda in cake batter. This cake would be much better without the topping. Just thinly iced with a cream cheese icing. Or a thin glaze over the top if you bake this in a bundt pan.

THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.THE CAKE IS JUST A 4 STAR TASTE(FRUIT DISAPEARED) BUT THE TOPPING IS A 5 STAR TASTE.NEXT TIME I MAKE ANY CAKE I WILL ICE IT WITH THIS COCONUT ICING.IT WOULD BE GREAT ON A SPICE CAKE OR A WHITE CAKE.

Much too sweet!! To make less sweet forget the brown sugar/nut combination. Doesn't need it Also definately cook the sugar butter milk combination until it thickens. Then add the coconut. The nuts can then be folded at this time into this topping.

This cake is wonderful if you love old-fashioned cakes like grandma makes. I grew up eating this cake and haven't had it since my grandma pasted. Only change I made was toasting the coconut icing by placing under broiler til lightly toasted. A keeper!

Absolutely wonderful. Didn't use coconut or nuts per family preferences used crushed corn flakes in place of walnuts. Thanks a bunch for the recipe!! Just what I was looking for to do something special with canned fruit cocktail!

What I like to do with it is after the batter is poured into the pan put it in the oven then half way through the baking put the coconut on top and continue baking until done. When the cake is out of the oven poke holes with a fork and then put on the topping. Let it sit. It is awsome and can last several days.

I made this and am not sure that white sugar is white powdered sugar or regular granulated sugar.. so went with white powdered sugar as I have never heard regular granulated sugar referred to as "white" sugar... I'm thinking that it should be the regular as mine did not come out very well with white powdered sugar.. please revise to say granulated..

I wasn't a great fan for this recipe... Sorry to say. I didn't use the coconut but I don't think it would make much of a difference.

i was looking for something really quick and easy to make on a friday morning. this was definitely both..... but i wasn't expecting this cake to be soooo yummy! i cut the recipe in half and made in 8x8 dish. i ended up still using a full can of fruit cocktail and added about 1/3c. of extra flour because all the extra juice made the batter a little runny. i thought it might turn out a bit gummy because of extra juice.... but it was perfect! tonight.... 4 days after making the cake i had a slice and it is still moist and yummy. great super easy cake! my husband loved it:)

My mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is soooo good. I call it ugly cake because it is not an attractive cake what so ever but 1 bite and you are in ooey gooey heaven! My husband turned his nose up at it when I told him the name and he saw it. He even said "what the heck is that thing" But he did try it and he LOVED it! (he is not even a coconut fan...) We had friends over and he could not stop telling them about how good this cake was! (of couse making them taste it too)I only wish it was better for the waist line! Oh well better get back to running because I refuse to give this cake up;O) Thanks for this recipe just like Mom used to make.

By far the best fruit cocktail I have had! Even better than what I remember as a child at grandma's house. A friend tried it saying that she wasn't much of a coconut fan. She loved it so much that instead of just a taste had a whole piece!

Loved it! I'm allergic to eggs so I omitted them and used 2tablespoons potato flour dissolved in 2 tablespoons water instead. Used canned peaches which I chopped small as I didn't have fruit cocktail. Thanks for recipe.

I made the cake but didn't have any coconut I did have cream cheese icing. I made the cake and poked holes in it like it said. I put cream cheese icing on it while still very warm. This is probably the way I'll make it from now on.

I've been looking for this recipe for years it's the same as my grandmother made and it's wonderful. This cake is rather a family tradition; I make it for my father who is diabetic and use Splenda instead of sugar in both cake and frosting. But for my family I make the the standard way. And I do add 2 tsp. vanilla.

I made my own fruit cocktail using peaches strawberries and pineapple and pulsed in my food processor to a nice blend. I added honey as sweetener of choice. I followed the recipe using 2 cups of this (including the juice it made as it mascerated). It was moist and delicious made in a bundt pan and frosted with a cream cheese frosting.

Just made this and it was quick easy and delicious! I did add some brown sugar and broken up walnuts over the top of the cake just before it went in the oven but I used a light hand and just lightly sprinkled both as I was worried it might be too sweet! I did poke the cake and add the topping which is very sweet but delicious. I might omit the topping next time as I think the cake would probably be just as good without it! I didn't have baking soda so I substituted Baking Powder and a pinch of salt instead. Always fun trying new recipes but I live alone and need to share 3/4 of this cake with friends before I get carried away! Will probably make this again someday when I am craving sweet goodies and have fruit cocktail and evaporated milk in my pantry!
