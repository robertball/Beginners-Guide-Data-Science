Great way to use leftover thanksgiving.  I substituted our leftover greenbeans for the peas which worked great.  I also added a little black pepper, a dash of thyme, and 2 dashes cayenne pepper to the filling for a little extra flavor since the recipe by itself was a touch bland.

This was good, but the chicken boullion made it very salty. I'd probably replace the water and boullion with chicken stock and salt to taste instead. I enjoyed the biscuit-like crust, but found it baked up very thick. I would cut the amound of crust and roll it thinner. As written, the crust was about an inch thick after baking and overwhelmed the filling. We ended up scooping out filling to add to the crust portions on the plates. Tasty recipe, but this needs a few tweeks as mentioned above.

This is a great versatile recipe. I have made it with turkey and chicken and with whatever vegetables I had on hand. I love that the crust is so easy and flavorful!

This was the first tine I made a turkey pot pie and my family loved it.  The only couple of thins I did diffferent was instead of using chicken boullin cubes I used chicken broth base. The second thing was for anyone that does not like the heavy top just roll it thinner and it works. Thanks so muck for the recipe.

Love this recipe and my family does too. Easy to double and substitute what you want.
