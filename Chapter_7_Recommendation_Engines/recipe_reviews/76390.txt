I think this is the best roast I have ever had! Instead of using what was listed I only used the cream of mushroom w/ a little bit of milk. I did not have any onion soup mix like another lady recommended so I covered the top of the roast with chopped onions and parsley.   This recipe was great!! Even the kids loved it. I think this has become one of my favorite meals.

I altered mine a bit. While the oven was preheating, I placed the 9x13 pan in oven to get it hot. I took a dinner plate and poured olive oil on it with a dash of Kosher Salt. After rinsing and patting the meat dry - I placed the roast in the olive oil to coat both sides. I grilled & seared both sides for 3 min. each. I put the roast on top of a bay leaf in the pre-heated pan (also lightly dusted with Kosher Salt). I poured half a can of beef broth in the pan (not over the meat) with whole garlic cloves. I took the roast out after the first hour and continued the recipe with a can of condensed cream of mushroom and a can of condensed cream of asparagus soups. I mixed those two with fresh chives from the garden. I put potatoes and brussel sprouts in the pan, poured the soup mixture over the meat and vegtables and covered with aluminum for an hour and a half.  I put fresh asparagus in the pan the last half hour of cooking. Then topped with cheese.  YUM! It was heaven.

Really easy and really yummy! The roasted meat came out tender and the veggies I used, carrots, red potatoes, and celery, chopped, came out perfectly cooked. I covered the meat with pepper and garlic for the first hour. My whole family loved it, including baby!

Very good! I made a few changes myself... Made a mixture with Montreal Steak Seasoning, basil, and olive oil and seared it in a pan for about 2 minutes on each side to brown. Roasted two big spoonfuls of garlic in olive oil, and rubbed it into the roast before I put it in the oven. I used 4 potatoes, a smaller container of mushrooms, and a pound of baby carrots with the two cans of cream of mushroom, no chives for us. It came out wonderfully! Made this for my husband for valentines day dinner, and will defiantly make it again!

I added the onion soup mix and browned the roast before putting it in the oven as other reviewers suggested.  It was delicious.  The whole family enjoyed it.  It was a little too much for my 9 x 13 pan.  I'll put it in a larger dish next time.  We will definitely make this again.

This was the best pot roast I ever had. I brought it to work and everyone wanted the recipe. Only change I made was I browned the roast with Kosher salt and olive oil. Then followed the recipe.

The roast I made tonight with this recipe was wonderful but very very rich. Things I did different: I rinsed and patted dry the roast, lightly coated it in EVOO and sea salt then seared on all sides to lock in the juices. Since I was using canned soup I opted for the low sodium version (just two cans of regular Cream of Mushroom). I used steak cut, pre-sliced mushrooms, baby carrots and instead of placing the roast by itself in the 9x13, I added 1 cup of chicken stock (was out of beef stock) as I was worried the meat would be too dry left by itself, and placed 3 whole (un peeled) cloves of garlic that I gently smashed with the side of a knife to release the oils in the cloves, in with the broth and baked for one hour before adding the rest of the ingredients. The actual cooking time will vary based on how big your roast is and how many potatoes and carrots you use. I used more than suggested so my cooking time was increased by 45 minutes. I garnished the whole dish with freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese for last 5 minutes. In the end this made a very rich, hearty dish that I know we will make again. Not as good as the Mississippi Roast from Sweet Tea and Cornbread - but perfect comfort food.

This was a hit with my husband. Followed directions and added 1/2 envelope onion soup mix. Next time I'll add onions. Love that you can play with different ingredients and still put a good home cooked meal on the table!

This was really moist and tasted great! I put all the ingredients except the cheese in a pot and cooked it slowly all day. I also browned the beef before putting it into the pan. My whole family thought it was tasty. SOOOO easy too! I also didnt end up putting the cheese on. Will be using this recipe again for sure.

Typical.  Veggies were great, but the meat needed a little more flavor and still can't get it as tender as my mean ol' mama's! I cooked on high in my slow cooker for 6 hours.  I'll probably have to edit my review once I try it on low for 10 hours.

Not bad at all. The meat was still tough but I didn't expect much from it, and some of the veggies, even when cut up small some were undercooked. The veggies and cream of mushroom made a nice stew but I wasn't sure if it was supposed to end up that soupy. It was a good dish but not one I'd be making again maybe.

Yummy - I sprinkeld some steak seasoning and garlic salt over the roast and then swapped out chives for diced white onion. I only used one can of soup because I had a smaller roast.

Okay, I loved this! Here's what I changed: Used two full cans of "plain" cream of mushroom soup. Next time will try lower sodium version. Didn't have chives and didn't use mushrooms.  Seared meat on all sides in cast iron dutch oven after sprinkling with salt and heating a tablespoon or two of olive oil.   Put dutch oven in oven for an hour. Also roasted a head of garlic in foil next to it (I think eHow has a good video on how to prepare it....sooooooo good!) and took the garlic out after about 40 mins.   Dumped baby carrots, quartered red potatoes and a quartered onion in. Mixed two cans of soup and the roasted cloves of garlic with a little milk to thin it out, then applied to everything in the pot.   Put the lid on or foil over the top (if you use foil, put a pan on the rack below...mine "spilled" onto the oven bottom--should be fun to clean). Two hours later, enjoy!!! Om nom nom...

Very good and sooooooooo tender!!!  I admit I was hesitant to put Cream soups on my roast but it was very good.  I was also hesitant to put CHEESE on it (how odd right?) but it was awesome.  I did brown my meat before putting it in the oven, and I think adding dry onion soup (as previous reviewer suggested) might be a nice flavor addition so we will try that next time. The whole family loved the dish and it will go into our reg. rotation.

Followed the directions to the letter other than no mushrooms.  I also chopped up and threw a whole onion on top.  Used the Montreal Steak Seasoning as someone else suggested (that stuff has never let me down) but didn't worry about "browning" the roast or coating it with Kosher salt.  Easily the tastiest and most flavorful roast I've ever had.  The meat was perfectly tender and, slathered in the creamy soup-like mixture left over, melted in your mouth and stuck to your ribs.  Perfect!!!  Incidentally, it was every bit as good on day 2.......

I'm in the process of cooking a chuck roast.  I wound up frying up some onion (with a bit of salt and after a minute a bay leaf) and while they fried I cut the beef into four pieces so it would cook faster and the flavors could sink into more places. I added salt, black pepper, Rosemary and garlic salt. As it browned I added some potatoes, mushrooms and carrots, peeled. Once it browned on all sides I added a half cup of Chardonnay (I had no red). 3 hrs @ 325

Even the kids (ages 5, 7 & 10) liked this, and they HATE mushrooms!

Without any changes, this is an outstanding dish.  I especially like the unique taste of the mushrooms.
3-12-13:  Had it again, with the same result.
