We liked this a lot and it also proved to be a good family project when the kids were home for the Thanksgiving holidays. We'll make these again, Thanks!

Dough was too dry to roll but adding a few drop of water helped.  My kids said they were just "ok".  Thats why I only gave 3 Stars.

I had high hopes because it seemed so easy. I followed the recipe exactly but it was SO dry. 3 drops of each food coloring wasn’t going to cut it, I did 10 drops and you can see the really pastel, gross pic I posted of the result of that. I kept putting my bowls of dough in the microwave to make it softer to work with, but it never mixed well. They taste only ok, my toddlers don’t even finish one of these cookies.  I have no clue what went wrong.

They are really easy to make. Kind of bland though so I would suggest adding more peppermint extract or sprinkle, something that gives it more flavor.

I made these years ago and they were great. Something must have changed in the recipe since because these were bland, difficult to roll, and dry af. Definitely not the same recipe. Simply awful

Too buttery in my opinion!  But the idea is a good one!

If I could I wouldn't give a star at all. I loved the idea of Christmas wreaths. I made a huge batch (wanting to make 200 cookies). Had to add quite a bit more food coloring than asked for. Took such a long time to roll into balls. But I thought all of the time would be worth it. First batch came out of oven and the wreath fell apart. All of the balls fell apart as I tried removing from sheet. I looked over the directions to make sure I didnt do something wrong, but I did all the steps correct.

Made this recipe for a cookie social we had. Thought they sounded good and would be perfect for Christmas. They are dry and not tasty at all. I sent the batch with my husband to work along with all the other left over cookies from the social and nobody ate them.

Made this for Recipe Group...These were good! I 1/2'd the recipe, and was glad I did only because they are a pain to roll into all of those little balls, lol...major time consumption. I didn't count the food coloring drops, but I knew I wanted vibrant Christmas colors. I don't know if I'd make these again, but they were fun to try for something different! Thanks for sharing. :)
