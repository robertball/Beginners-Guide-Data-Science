These burgers are amazing. I omitted the fresh ginger (since I didn't have any) and added a little extra ground ginger. They're so delicious. My husband and daughter are extremely picky and they asked me to make these again.

These were AWESOME!!  The only change I made was to use a little extra 5-Spice Powder, and these were so amazingly fantastic that my husband immediately asked when we would be having them again.  I'm not normally a fan of turkey burgers, and even I was wolfing mine down!  I cooked these on my George Foreman grill for 6 minutes, which was perfect, and served them on home-made onion buns with goat's milk gouda.  My only complaint was that I couldn't really taste the pineapple (probably due to using canned instead of fresh).  Next time, I will likely omit it and replace is with a dollop of a tangy barbeque sauce we like.  Really fantastic recipe!!!  ******Okay, it's now "next time!"  This time, I added a little more 5-spice powder, replaced the gouda with smoked mozzarella (it's what I had) and made sure to use fresh pineapple instead of canned, and oh WOW, what a difference! The hubby and I agreed immediately that the fresh pineapple takes this to a whole another level.

These were absolutely delicious!!!  I omitted the ground ginger and must used more fresh and I forgot to put the fresh spinach leaves on it - but the end result was incredible served with garlic mayo.  I should note that I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey - we will definitely make these again! EDIT - I made these again and used ground turkey - the end result was still very good. This is easily my favorite turkey burger recipe!

The flavors that mingle in this burger places you somewhere in an exotic location.  Wonderful texture, flavor, and combination of ingredients.  I was out of turkey and used beef instead, and it was still fantastic!  Don't muck with the other called for ingredients, they really add to the overall experience of the burger.

Wanted to try another recipe for turkey burger, the last ones we made were kind of dry.  This one is very moist and all the flavors blended together delicioso!  Did make a few modifications:  used the whole egg, threw in more onion, used white mexican cheese and cooked in the oven (under broiler for last few minutes, including pineapple.  This is a keeper for us and encourage you all to try as well.

I had to laugh regarding the reviewer who " used ground beef instead of turkey and omitted the 5 spice" yet rated THIS recipe. Amazing....

One of our favorites. Shared with my mom and now it's one of their favorites too. Patties freeze well for later use.

We just had these burgers for dinner tonight and they were delicious! I followed the recipe but used colby jack cheese since I didn't have the gouda handy. I served them with mango chutney as a condiment and it was a good match. Be sure to cook the pineapple until it is soft. We charred the pineapple lightly then turned off the grill so we could leave the slices to cook at a lower temp for awhile. Fantastic!

This was good! Used ground beef instead of turkey and omitted the Chinese spice mix. But it turned out very good. Everyone loved it. Better with 2 pineapple rings vs. one!

WOO HOO! This has become the ONLY burger recipe we ever make. Not only is turkey much healthier, but this flavor combination is fantastic. I have never had fresh ginger or been able to find 5 Spice powder (I have used powdered ginger, and other asian spices in minimal amounts) but the recipe is still wonderful, so don't decide not to try it because you don't have those ingredients on hand. The pineapple on top adds to the juicy-ness of it. Never dry, always good. We've tried different types of cheese and buns as well, always a HUGE hit!

I liked the flavor of this burger, especially with the addition of the grilled pineapple. They were easy to make and nice and moist. Next time I think I'll add a bit more soy sauce and ginger and use a it less five-spice powder, but that's just a personal preference. The burgers were tasty as is and my husband and I both enjoyed them.

I thought this was a pretty turkey burger, it had a nice flavor and was very moist.  The rest of my family would probably only rate it 3 stars---they like another recipe on AR better:  "Indian Turkey Burgers With Lime, Cucumbers & Chutney".   Would still make these again but, would cut back a bit on the spices.  Served with an asian sweet slaw  & Crispy Homemade Fries (AR recipe).

this was absolutely DELICIOUS! I put extra ginger and a little pineapple juice in the burger. Very juicy and flavorful! Great on the George Forman Grille!

These are awesome!  I was out of both ginger and 5-spice powder (darn it!) but the rest of the ingredients give the turkey SUCH a good flavor.  I also used regular buns and added pickles.  Yum!

I guess I am the only one who didn't like this recipe.  The only redeeming thing is that they were not dry.   I did not like the combination of the flavors.  Sorry.

This was so amazing!!! My family LOVED it, and I feed a somewhat picky 10 year old. Only difference was I used regular buns. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Are these too fast to get a photo! This recipe is amazing. The only thing I modified was using a little mayo/bbq mix on the buns. The flavor of the burgers mixed with the pineapple and cheese was wonderful.

I used dry chopped onion instead of cutting a fresh onion and made 1/3lb burgers served over spicy brown mustard and topped the pineapple and burger with a drizzle of siracha. Everybody loved it! This combo was the best turkey burger I’ve ever had.

OMG!  This was delicious!  Aside from the Gouda, I found this to be a perfect substitute for regular burgers for my recovering cardiac event husband.  The combination of spices with the pineapple and then the Gouda plus the onion bun made this something that is just so tasty and that I will be making often.  The only change I made was to make it with fresh ground chicken as I didn't have turkey.  It was fantastic!

These were great!  Didn't have any fresh ginger, but found that the powered was enough.  I added about 1 tablespoon of tereyaki sauce and these burgers were super moist and delicious!

Overall, delicious and tender.  I added whole egg, not just the egg white. I grilled fresh pineapple.  Don't use Gouda cheese- it does not melt.  Use Gruyere or a good melting cheese like Havarti or cheddar.  Have yum yum fun eating these turkey burgers.

Absolute hit! Only mods were 1 1/2 cup addt'l broth and 1/2 cup white wine, dried parsley, and omitted red pepper flakes. As many others said, this definitely had to cook longer. I had to leave home right after cooking this and didnt know what to expect from my family of diverse tastes. But, I returned to a chorus of "that pasta was delicious" as I walked in the door.

Made these with fresh pineapple, followed the recipe exactly.  They are okay, but I still haven't got what I'm looking for, an alternative to a beef burger that my husband will eat.
Again, I'm stuck with several days of turkey burgers ahead of me.  sigh.
