This is so refreshing!  I thought it would be sweet enough without the added sugar and for our tastes it was.  I also added an extra tsp of almond extract.  This can also be frozen for longer, stirred as it starts to freeze 4 or 5 times and eaten as sherbert.  Thanks, Cuppy this is great!

This really was delicious and was very easy to make, I've made it with and without the extra sugar and like it both ways.

I made this for the 'Why doesn't anyone make my recipe?' challenge. The flavor is delicious! I would have given it 5 stars except that I found it way too sweet. If I had passed on the added sugar, it would have been perfect. Thanks, Cuppycake!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to leave out the sugar.  I am glad that I did.  I chilled it and served it over ice. I think the colder it got the better it tasted. Very refreshing.

This was good. I halved the amount of sugar, since others said it was too much, and it was still quite sweet. I would recommend halving the sugar.
