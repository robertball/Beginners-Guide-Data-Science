I have made many recipes from AllRecipes, many of them good or great, but this is the first spectacular enough to rate.  I will never make cupcakes the "old" way again.  The filling is out-of-this world -- the slight tang of the cream cheese contrasts so nicely with the rich chocolate of the cupcake and the chocolate chips make it extra special.  I did cheat a bit -- I used a mix for the cupcakes, but you'd never know with the great filling!  By the way, this works equally well as a swirl-style filling for cake.  Just dollop the filling on top of the batter in the pan and use a knife to swirl it in.  Mmmmmm, it's so delicious and so easy!  I make the filling right in the same bowl as the cake mix -- just pour the cake mix into your cupcake pan or cake pan, throw the filling ingredients into the bowl, give it a quick mix, and dollop onto the cupcakes or cake.  So easy.  Definitely try this filling!

Quite a good recipe!  The end result is a much more tasty, moist, delicious version of an already good chocolate cupcake.  Like others suggested, I hid the filling in the middle by filling the liner 1/3 full of batter, then added the cream cheese dollop, and then added another 1/3 of the batter on top.  It's really easy to create a "pastry bag" to fill the liners by using two plastic bags filled with the batter and the filling, cutting the tips off of the bags, and then squeezing out the right amount of each into the cups.  I did it like an assembly line and I was done in no time. It's a much neater way of filling the cups.

I followed the recipe almost to a "T" - I did add more sugar to the batter as a few reviewers had suggested. Not much more, I just kind of winged it. These did come out very tasty; I like that fact that they weren't too sweet. My one major mistake was using foil cupcake liners. The cupcakes stuck to them and it was a pretty big process separating them. So, make sure you use paper liners or if you have to use foil  liners make sure you spray them with cooking spray first. I'm taking these to Easter dinner tomorrow, if they're a hit there then I'll definitely make them again b/c they were very easy to make.

These cupcakes are awesome.  I changed them up a bit by replacing the water with brewed coffee and  adding a bit of Baileys mint chocolate to the cream cheese mixture.

Delicious! Make sure you let them sit overnight. Fresh out of the oven doesn't taste too great.

These cupcakes were awesome.  I didn't think they needed anything to make them sweeter.  The ONLY thing I would do different would be to fill the cupcakes only 1/3 of the way, then put the dollop of cream cheese mix and then top with the other 1/3 of the cupcake mix.  Then it would truely be a "surprise."

Awesome!  I have made these many times---always come out great and I have gotten many complements!  Made them for my daughter's 1st Birthday party.  I recently made a double layer cake using this recipe.  I pureed fresh raspberries, added the puree to my cream cheese icing, put the raspberry icing between the 2 layers, frosted the rest of the cake with plain cream cheese icing and drizzled the remaining raspberry icing on top of the cake.  Turned out VERY rich, but OH SO GOOD!

Fabulous! I'm 6 months pregnant and these were SOOO yummy!!! The chocolate chips are still soft the next day too, I was afraid they would cool off and become hard again. I cooked mine a little less, about 20 minutes because they looked done at that time.

These are very, very good. If you do decide to use a cake mix, just remember that if you keep the oven temp at 350 as the recipe calls for, the cake will cook faster than the filling, and you'll end up with a still-liquid center. The remedy is to turn the oven temp down to 325 so they bake a little slower.

This recipe was fantastic! I made these cupcakes for my partner's birthday at work (they have to take in a cake on their birthday) and he sent me an email after they'd started having them...
"your cakes are a hit and all the women hate you because you set the standard too high"
I've been asked for the recipe by every woman I've met who ate them and all the men think my partner is a very luck boy :) What more can I say?

Made these for New Years--delicious, but they looked a little "naked."  I made a chocolate glaze (mix 1/4 c melted butter, 1 T cocoa, 1/4 c xxx sugar, and 1 t vanilla until crumbly, then add boiling water by the T until spreadable with a pastry brush) then sprinkled with decorative gold sugar crystals.  Dressed them right up, and the filling was more of a surprise, because eaters couldn't see the filling peeking through the top.

The cupcakes are delicious.  I would suggest only cooking the for about 20 minutes or else they will stick to the paper liners.  Definitely put them in the fridge and let them sit for a few hours to get the cheesecake style filling to be correct.

One word....WOW!!  I made these for a bunch of chocolate lovers and they were huge hit!  I only made one change to the recipe (used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil) and they turned out really moist, rich, and sweet.  I may have used too much filling b/c they ended up looking marble all over (which looked pretty).  I covered the cupcakes with a  peanut butter icing but they were better without icing.  The chocolate chips make these cupcakes really standout!

I've been making these cupcakes for Halloween for 25 years.  To make the centers orange add yellow and red food coloring to the cream cheese mixture (and grated orange peel if you want it to taste orange).  The variations are endless...green for St. Patricks day, etc...

I made these cupcakes a couple of times but not often because they make so many.  But they are awesome and I love them.  One thing I did do was added some chopped pecans to the filling.  I love nuts and put them in nearly everything I fix!  LOL

These are absolutely delicious! Moist-Rich-Yum-O! I was a bit frightened but the thin runny consistency of the chocolate batter and the fact that only the cream cheese filling had egg. I had a semi sweet bar on hand that I shaved instead of using choc chips.
I took other reviewers advice and put about 1/3 of choc batter, then a scoop of filling and covered with choc batter. I baked on Thursday, refrigerated airtight and frosted friday morning with Orange Cream Cheese Frosting.
Oh my goodness are they delicious!! - wait did I say that already? I don't know how you can go south with this recipe if you follow directions. Thank You OP!

My grandma passed down a recipe just like this, but it's cake instead of cupcakes. Before baking, cream cheese/chocolate chip mixture can be spooned on top of batter in a 9x13 pan, then run butter knife through to make a marble effect. Also, if you're baking for somebody who doesn't like cream cheese, you can leave a portion of the cake plain and it bakes up wonderfully. Baking time will be slightly longer than a regular crazy cake because of the cream cheese "surprise." Top with a rich fudge frosting and you have a chocolate lover's dream!

Nice, moist chocolate cupcakes.  I just felt they were missing something, so I ended up adding a chocolate glaze to them. Then, they were terrific.

Very unique and yummy cupcakes! Followed recipe exactly except for I took cupcakes out at 20 minutes and found them to be perfectly done. Definitely let them cool completely before eating. The cream cheese part does not taste like cheesecake as I thought it would but delicious none the less. The semisweet chocolate chips add just the right amount of flavor. Will make again!

This recipe is terrific! I initially had a slight doubt about the cake batter ( because it had no eggs), I wondered if it would be moist enough. No worries, incredibly moist, not dense at all. I baked some for my family and co-workers using the partial fill, filling and topping off technique. I used different size of cookie scoops- worked like a charm. I used mini chocolate chips for better texture ans added 1 tsp of vanilla to the filling. After cooling, the topper was cream cheese icing- divine! I was told I could bring these to work any time. My husband who is generally noncommittal about things said these were delicious. High praise for a cupcake! I'll be making these again.

Mine did not really come out moist but that's due to my oven.  I did hesitate on the 25 min baking time but since I'm not one to make cupcakes, decided to follow the recipes baking time (big mistake).  I used Splenda in place of sugar for my diabetic mother who loves sweets.  The filling was OK, nothing really special but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese type fillings.  Overall the cupcakes tasted very bland.  Throwing them away and going to try again later this week with a different filling and less baking time.

I have been making these for years and I get requests for them all the time.  I had decided to make a different cupcake for my son's birthday this year and heard so much griping I am scrapping the other recipe and making these.  I follow the recipe to the tee and never have a problem with them.  I put Cream Cheese Frosting II on them.  Delish!

The filling did not cook while the rest of the cupcake was cooked. The next round, I decided not to put the filling in and it was fantastic, great texture!

So Rich!!  I can only eat one of these a day (glad I have my big kids to help me out, lol).  But I'm pretty proud of being able to bake these now.  Quite ideal for future celebrations and the like.  Thanks!

Rating is for recipe idea. I was pressed for time and ended up making this as a 9 x 13 cake. Along with that modification, I made the following changes:  cut sugar to 1 C.; added 3/4 C. semi-sweet choc chips to dry ingredients; added 3/4 C milk choc chips to cream cheese batter and subbed 10X sugar for white in that batter; added 1 C. flaked coconut to cream cheese. Spread choc. batter in pan then dropped cr cheese batter sporadically over and ran a knife through in a swirl pattern in both directions to disperse cr. cheese. Sprinkled sliced almonds on top. Baked for 35 mins. and it was moist and yummy!

These are FANTASTIC cupcakes.  Very easy to make (even from scratch) with great chocolate taste.  These will be made time and time again!  Family loved them too.  Like not having to ice them, but still moist and very flavorful.  Will try this as a cake next time!

Great dessert. Just remember to chill anything not immediately eaten. I didn't and discovered the hard way that cream cheese will go bad pretty darned quick. I also add the cream cheese mis about at the half way level in the muffin cup and then fill to the brim with the cupcake mix. When done properly it makes for a nice surprise as the filling is completely hidden.

Just made these today and my husband can not stop eating them . They are really a great chocolate treat . I did use 2tbs more of the semisweet chips . I used the paper liners , and still had a problem with them sticking , but not enough to where they were a pain to eat . I did one batch of the cupcakes with the cream cheese on top , then another batch with the cream cheese in the middle , both were great both ways ... I just prefer them in the middle , due to how pretty they come out . Thanks for a great recipe !

Wonderful recipe.  Next time I will not fill the cups so full.  I will have the foil cups on hand for the 2-3 extras that this recipe will make.  I was worried about how thin the cream cheese mixture was, but it turned out wonderful.  Easy enough so that I will not have to ever buy a boxed cake again.  Any similar scratch recipes for a white or yellow cake?

This was a success when I made it for Valentine's day, my boyfriend and his family loved it. It was easy to make, just remember that when you check to see if they are done from the oven, the tester will always come with a little chocolate specially if you poke the middle of the cupcake (this because the chocolate chip melts) so it doesnt mean it needs more cooking!

Very good and very rich.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the baking time, mine were done in about 20 minutes) and frosted them with peanut butter frosting.  They turned out very rich and moist.

I was surprised the batter didn't have any egg in it, I had to go through the ingredients twice because I thought I was forgetting something. This makes a lot of batter though, I had probably 30 cupcakes worth even after filling them almost full. It tasted great, just like a cupcake with cheesecake baked in it. So if you want something lighter or creamier, this recipe is not for you.

These cupcakes are soo moist and flavorful! I was intimated and thought I had done something wrong because the cream cheese filling was very runny when I dropped it in the batter, but it came out perfect.   A must try!

they're delicious! i did make a few changes tho - i ran out of white sugar so i used one cup of light brown, instead of mixing the chocolate chips with the cream cheese mixture, i sprinkled them on the tops, i used strong coffee instead of water, and i also baked them for only twenty minutes. 
the first batch i put the cream cheese on top, but didn't like the look of them when they came out of the oven, so the next batch i filled the cups 1/3 then added the cream cheese, then topped them up with more cake mixture, and no chocolate chips.  they're far more attractive, and a little more 'grown up' without the chips.
next time i bake these i'm going to add a small amount of cherry pie filling before i bake them too!

I made these with my 2 & 4 years old boys.   They were really excited that we were going to surprise Daddy with something hidden in the cupcakes.   Used the cake recipe here, thought they were good, maybe next time I would add some zucchini to the cake batter to make it a little moister and get veggies in.  I poured a little cake batter in, added the cream cheese mixture, and then more cake batter.  We aren't going to frost them, I don't think they need it.

I adjusted the recipe by changing the oil to unsweetened applesauce, the sugar to Stevia in the Raw and the cream cheese to reduced fat.  Made it as a cake and it is TO DIE FOR!!  24 pieces = 3 WW PointsPlus each.

I love these cupcakes.  I made them as the recipe says, using mini chocolate chips in the filling, but the regular ones would have worked as well.  I have 2 cupcake tins -- one is silver and the other is dark non-stick, and the ones in the dark tin puffed up more.  Tasted just the same, but the puffier ones were prettier.  Either way, it's such an easy recipe and we gobbled.  The magazine said if you want to freeze them, leave them in the tins, cover well, and freeze solid, then transfer to bags to keep frozen.  Highly recommend that as they are very delicate.

These were good and easy. I ended up putting buttercream frosting on top, which was good, but a  bit too sweet for me. Next time I will probably do a glaze or some light frosting.

This is a great recipie!!  I cheated and substituted the cupcake mix with a Devil's Food fix for that exta fluffy, extra dense texture.  I then added a cream cheese frosting (from a can).  Topped it off with a raspberry and mint leaf.

I was really skeptical about these, especially since the cake batter doesn't contain eggs.  But the chocolate cake is even moister and fluffier than box cake, which I think is hard to beat in the "moist and fluffy" department!

In the first batch, I tried to push the cream-cheese mixture down into the cupcake and cover it a bit at the top, to "hide" the filling inside.  But when I did that, I really couldn't even taste the cream cheese mixture.  That mixture is really not intended to be a liquidy center, just a punch of different taste in an otherwise normal chocolate cupcake.  The chocolate chips do give it a bit of the liquidy feel.  I'd recommend sticking with a dollop at the surface, and not trying to make it a center thing.

I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet because that's what I had on hand, but I think semisweet would definitely have been better.  Milk was too sweet.  I also had a lot of the cream-cheese mixture left over.  You could cut down on the ingredients to make less of it.

Great treat especially for kids, and easy to make. My nearly-2 and 3-year-old girls helped me, and I didn't have that usual "let them lick the beaters" guilt because of raw egg.  There is no egg in the cake! :)  (I might have snuck some myself.)

Wow, wow, wow! These are so delicious. They taste like cupcakes from a bakery. I made them for a group and they got rave reviews. I made them with the frosting from Pioneer Woman's blog called The Best Frosting Ever and it complimented these really well. I could eat these everyday.

I have never, ever made cupcakes from scratch, these are so easy and soooo worth it. I made them for a get together at our house and let me tell you they were a BIG HIT.  I still get people ask for them and for the recipe.  Mmmmm, definitely making them again.

I have been making these for more then 40 years. I mostly just  use a chocolate mix, sometimes I use chocolate & peanut butter chips in the cream cheese for a little different flavor.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. Many it was just me, but the cupcakes seemed very dense. This may just be a trait of Black Bottom cupcakes, but it wasn't very appealing. The taste was good, however.

Bf really loved this.  I think it's too rich, but I'm not a huge chocolate fan, or cream cheese fan, so I'm not sure my opinion on this should count so much.  I made this in a bundt cake pan instead of as cupcakes, and baked for about an hour.  It worked well, but it doesn't look that pretty, probably bc it's just such a heavy cake that a bundt cake isn't the best way.  But I'm okay with it, and I made it a tad prettier with a bunch of mint.  :o)  The cake itself is rich, heavy, and full of flavor so we'll call it a success.  Thanks for the recipe!

i went by the recipe exactly as written and WOW!  I always have trouble with my cupcakes coming out dry but these were moist and delicious.  The filling is creamy and wonderful.  The ONLY thing I did differently was bake them for 20 minutes instead of 25 minutes.  Great recipe!

Many good things to say about this recipe.  This was an afternoon project for my daughter and I and I'm glad I chose it because she was really able to see the science behind the baking when the vinegar reacted with the baking soda.  Obviously, her favorite part of the process was licking the bowl!  I found this under 'Easter Recipes' so I thought I'd make it a little more festive, by crushing mini-eggs instead of chocolate chips for the filling.  Sweet heaven!

I started making them and thought that they won't be all that great. I was WRONG. They are delicious and my family loves them. These cupcakes have to be some of the best i've ever made. Anyone who loves creamcheese and chocolate should deffinatly make them. I only had a 12 size cupcake holder, so i did the 12 and did a small cake with the batter and leftover filling. That also turned out great with a little bit of the leftover chocolate chips on top.

I'm still a novice as far as baking without cake mixes goes, so I was absolutely thrilled with how these turned out! Rich, moist, creamy, and just plain delectable. I will definitely be saving this recipe! The cream cheese filling wasn't enough for me, so I'll make more next time. Granted, cream cheese is one of my favorite flavors. :)

I also used soy milk instead of water, and only had apple cider vinegar so I used that instead. Everyone loved them, even my sister who has extremely high standards with baked foods!

I made these and they were fantastic. I used chunks instead of chips, and I also used about 50% more cocao, which made them very rich. They are best after having cooled for several hours or even the next day, so I recommend making them well in advance of your intended use. I also added a little bit of butter to the cream cheese mixture which helped it to disperse a little and cook into the cake a bit...excellent! Everyone loved them.

This receipe was super fast, easy and delicious!  My boyfriend is not a huge dessert person but he loved these cupcakes.  The only thing I changed was to to swap out the water with coffee and I used whipped lowfat creamcheese so my hands wouldn't fall off (unforunately, I don't have a mixer).  Great receipe and thanks for sharing Kelly.

I make cupcakes often for family birthdays and these were by far the tastiest. I did use a cupcake mix and like other reviewers, I filled the cupcake cups 1/3, dolloped the cream cheese mix on top, and added the remaining cupcake mix. These were fantastic!!

These really didn't pack the punch that I had hoped-- perhaps I am used to baking with melted chocolate, not cocoa-- and I was also suspicious of adding 2 cups of water (instead of milk). How do they taste? Like cupcakes made with cocoa, not melted chocolate, and made with water, not milk. Even a cake mix has more flavor than these.

amazing recipe!! i have never made cupcakes from scratch before and i am soooo happy i decided on this recipe. if i could give it 10 stars i would. i followed the recipe just as written EXCEPT i filled the cup 1/3 full with chocolate mix and then a dollop of cream cheese filling and then filled the rest full of chocolate mix. i wanted them to look just like chocolate cupcakes so when you bite in you get a gooey surprise. i added a thin layer of colored frosting to brighten it up. very moist and a HUGE hit at work. i brought them in for a co-workers birthday and they are GONE!!! i will make them over and over and over again.

These are really good. The cake part is terrific, by the way. Next time I make cupcakes, I might just use the chocolate cake recipe by itself! *Update, I made a 2nd batch of these frosted with "Fluffy White Frosting" - my advice, DON'T frost, seriously.  Or at least try one each way before serving.  They're dense, sweet, rich, and the filling is very cheesecake-like, and overall were much better received unfrosted - even by the sugar-fiend kids in our neighborhood.

These turned out really well. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. When preparing, I added 1/3 cake batter, the dollop of cream cheese mix and then topped with cake batter, as many others have suggested. I lowered the oven temperature to 337ish and baked for 23 minutes.

I'm surprised that some people felt they weren't sweet enough. I found them almost too sweet.

I made these for a friend's birthday at work and they were gone before I could even get one (glad I'd sampled them the night before). Everyone loved them and asked when I was making them again. I hid the cream cheese filling in between layers of chocolate - a little more work, but it was worth it. I also only baked them for 20 minutes and they were done. I got 30 cupcakes out of the recipe and had enough filling for all of them. I did not ice them (easier to transport) and they didn't seem to need it. I'm making them again right now (they're in the oven) and I smell wonderful!

I read the mixed reviews of this recipe, but I decided to try it for my son's birthday anyway.  I followed the recipe, except substituting sour cream for the cream cheese.  The cupcakes sunk in the middle, and were hard on the outside.  Nobody could get them out of the paper.   I layered the batter as suggested, too!  Don't know what went wrong!  However, there was some leftover batter, and I baked it in a 8-inch round pan, dropping the filling on top and swirling it.  It was delicious, and the guests loved it!  I think I will try this recipe in a 9 x 13 pan, it will probably turn out great.

I've made these a couple times now, and everyone has absolutely loved them.  Just be careful how full you fill the muffin tin cups, because they rise pretty good.  It's probably my own fault for filling them 3/4 full, THEN adding the "surprise" filling which (surprise!) fills the cups nearly completely.  Still, lovely recipe.

i baked this early yesterday morning, to try out this recipe. i was kinda excited and cannot wait to bake this, cuz when i first read the recipe, i thought that it was an easy one. true! wonderful! its kinda moist and creamy. btw i tried to add-up butter cream frosting on top for the fun of it. surprisingly, its blend nicely with the cake when eaten together. so i guess for those who said that the cupcake was not sweet enough, why not you try this my way? ;)

This is a classic recipe and something my Mom always used to make.  These are DEFINITELY my favourite cupcakes and people are always shocked at how yummy they are!  The cream cheese makes them taste incredible. I always put a few extra chocolate chips in the cupcakes to make them more chocolatey & less dry.

Accidentally put the egg in the batter (it was really late at night and I was exhausted) but it turned out moist and delicious anyway. The cream cheese "surprise" was a nice touch. I followed others' suggestions and filled the cup partway with batter, then cream cheese mixture and more batter in top.

I was looking for a cupcake recipe for our work cupcake contest. I decided to make this. I was a bit unsure about the recipe since the batter didn't call for eggs. I used 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of water. My cousin said that coffee brings out the chocolate flavor. I used mini chocolate chips in the filling. I ended up with 24 cupcakes and had lots of filling left so I made a half batch but used plain water and made 24 mini cupcakes for my son's Valentine's day party. I still had about 1 big scoop of filling left. The regular size cupcakes baked for 23 minutes in a gas oven and the minis took about 21 minutes. I used the chocolate ganache frosting from this site. Placed them in the fridge over night. I agree with the other viewers that it tastes much better the next day. It was rich and full of flavor. I didn't have any issues with the cake sticking to the paper liner, after it was cooled. I received a lot of compliments at work. And the kids at my son's class said it was the best cupcakes ever. Even though I didn't win, I would say that I did win. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved the cupcake portion of the recipe but not the filling.  Next time I will make a marshmallow filling.  I loved the chocolate cupcake portion, just added some espresso powder to it and the flavor was not too sweet and loved the texture.  Another thing was I followed the recipe from the AllRecipes magazine and it didn't say how many cupcakes it made so I had some leftover batter and filling.  Afterwards I went online and the website version did give the amount the recipe made.  Wished I had gone there before making these cupcakes/

I made this from a cookbook I have and was very glad to see it here. I made a mistake when putting the ingredients together and put the dry chocolate in the cream cheese and bits, so I added everything else and stirred. Then I sprayed with Pam and filled a mug 1/2 full of the mixture and baked for 1 minute. Repeating this until the mixture was gone. You need to clean the mug after every use as moisture collects in the bottom, so wipe or wash and spray just a quick spray of Pam, it came out like a lava cake. The cream cheese when to the bottom and was a great dessert with my life saver dinner last night when the oven went out.  I did use cider vinegar as I had no white vinegar and I used 3 banty eggs.

I made 2 batches. The first batch turned out terrible and the second was very good. Here's what I learned: I used boxed cake mix and it was still delicious. Be super liberal with the cream cheese filling. It makes a huge difference. And most importantly, do not over bake! I stuck my toothpick in and saw it was wet so I baked another 5 minutes. Huge mistake! The wet was from the melted chocolate chips. Duh! The final time I used was 18 minutes. I love frosting as much as the next person, but I like these better without frosting. I frosted the first batch and it was too overpowering.

I made these last year and my son love them. I tried again recently but the cream cheese filling was too runny and rose to the top when baked. Wasn't sure if the recipe was changed since last year, but I tried a second batch without an egg in the filling and they came out just fine.

The chocolate flavor was good but the texture was heavy and dry if you were not biting into the "surprise" filling. The filling was very good. I would only make these again if they were intended to be the bottom of a bowl of ice cream or if they were going to be topped w/fruit that included some juice.

I used a boxed cake mix.  I made the filling per the recipe, it is Wonderful!   I made them for a party and they were a big hit, super moist.  Wonderful!

These were delicious. Made for a bridal shower and were a big hit. I put chocolate icing on top because of the occasion but probably didn't need it for the taste.

This was delicious!! What I did was put a bit of the mixture on the bottom, then add filling, and then more mixture on top so the filling is hidden. Very yummy!!!

This recipe is not good! I made these and followed the recipe to a T. The filling is excellent and I made a glaze for the top but the cake part itself is not good at all. I would suggest using a different cake recipe or just using a box cake!

Rave reviews!  Made for my workplace.  Used tip of filling part way, then added surprise plus a little more batter on top.  They could not get enough. For my second batch, I had to cheat and use box cake mix so there were enough to go around.  No one knew the difference.    I had leftover filling so that weekend I made for my family.  It was much easier to get the exact right portion of filling once it was refrigerated.  This recipe will stay in my recipe box forever.  Thank you!

Made these for Easter and everybody loved them.  In fact they were fighting over the last one.  The surprise filling adds an extra goodness to the regular chocolate cupcake.  Will be making these again!!

This is an outstanding recipe. I made it as stated except I followed others suggestion and filled the paper liner 1/2 full before adding the cream cheese. Doing this ensured that you didn't see any of the cream cheese surprise on top. Although the cupcake was absolutely delicious at this point, for appearance I added a cream cheese frosting on top.

oh my goodness.  These are a little bite of heaven!  I followed suggestions to put a little batter in the cupcake liner, then the cream cheese mixture, then top with more batter.  I always get more than 24 cupcakes - usually 30 - but maybe my pan is just smaller.  I bake them for 20 minutes, and they come out perfectly moist but cooked through.  I have found that if I let the cream cheese soften too much, the centers kind of melt into the chocolate part.  I remedy that by using the cream cheese straight out of the fridge.  Excellent recipe - my sister renamed them "Crack Cupcakes" because she's addicted to them LOL!! Thanks for a great recipe Kellygurll :)

Delicious.  Moist cake batter.  Cream cheese filling is a nice change from icing.  Kids also loved it - they all asked for another one.

Really good! The only thing I changed was to use mini chocolate chips because that's all I had. I only used 1/2 cup, but with the tiny chips scattered around it was plenty. Super tasty. Thanks!

Sooooo easy and soooo delicious. My daughter -11 years and son -6 years helped to make these for her birthday. They were fun to make and eat. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed them. We found ours to be moist and chocolaety. It was really wonderful that such simple ingredients could produce such delightful results. This recipe is already in my "favorite recipes" box!

Made according to recipe. The chocolate part was good, but the cream cheese filling was tasteless. Well the cream cheese part of it was tasteless, but the chocolate chips themselves were good. In my opinion the cupcakes were not worth the effort.

These cupcakes were so-so. They didn't have enough chocolate flavor, even after adding 1/4 cup extra cocoa powder (I used Ghiradelli cocoa powder.) The texture was kind of dense, the cupcake dry (I added extra water to the recipe after adding more cocoa.)  I can see how reviewers who use BOXED cake mix would rate this so high, they aren't really rating the recipe as written. I won't make these again, I'll use the recipe I have been using to make these "black bottom cupcakes" for years......it's much better!

Don't know what I did wrong the first time but mine came out piebald - see photo.  I think it was the cream cheese - we can't get Philly in France so I used the french equivalent but when I added the egg and sugar and tried to beat until fluffy, it just turned into soup. Tastewise though, these were gorgeous. I was surprised the cake mix had no eggs? My mix made 6 extra cakes but that could be a difference in size of the cupcake cases/tins. The second (of many!) time, I found Kiri Kiri cheese squares and they worked just fine. I mix the dry ingredients in a 2litre jug, add the liquid and then use this to pour into the cake cases - less mess! Also, do take the other reviewers' advice and fill cases to one third, then add the cheese mix, then cover with another dollop of cake mix.  These have fast become a favourite in our house and I've had to change my usual weekly batch of 'normal' cupcakes to this recipe instead ;)) It's also one of the very few recipes I haven't altered in ANY way! Thanks Kellygurll for sharing.

This simple recipe made my first attempt at scratch-made cupcakes a breeze. They were delicious; I just have one or two caveats.  I just wished that the flavor of the cream cheese was more prominent.  I think that next time I'll add more of the filling to the center of each cupcake.  Also, the actual cupcake wasn't very chocolately, but the chocolate chips made up for that shortcoming. Overall, they were very tasty!

I made these exactly according to the recipe and I am seriously shocked that anyone would add more sugar!!  The cupcakes are PERFECT and I would even say the filling was a little too sweet- I will considerably cut down the sugar in it next time!  I accidentally overfilled my liners, so the cupcakes didn't turn out too pretty... but oh boy are they yummy!!  And contrary to another reviewer- I think they tasted amazing when they were warm fresh from the oven!  Add to that how easy these were to make, and all with ingredients I had on hand and these cupcakes will be made again! :)  Thank You!

This was a really cool recipe.  I was so eager to try out the finished product that I didnt wait for it to sit and cool. I was sort of disappointed at first. But then I decided to wait a few hrs and let the middle thicken up a bit and YUMM!! I should have listened to the people who reviewed this before me :) Oh and I used a store bought cake mix, I know, I know, I cheated. But it still tasted great!

I was VERY disappointed with this recipe! I dropped a spoonful of the filling in the middle and covered it with a bit more chocolate batter. When I cut into one, all that could be seen was a white line running through the chocolate cupcake. This was served to guests, but not totally consumed.

i don't know what i did wrong, but I followed this recipe to the T - i tried the batter before hand, and it tasted way too floury for me so i added a bit more sugar - like other suggested.  it still tasted off so i decided to make a couple just to see if the cream cheese filling made a difference - instead of cupcakes (i didn't have any paper cup liners) i put them into souffle cups.  

No one in my family liked these - which is weird because of all of the rave reviews.

I'm not making these again

This has become my favorite cupcake! They are absolutely delicious! Even my husband who isn't a big cream cheese fan request these cupcakes now and again. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added a smidgen of the batter to each cup after filling them with the cream-cheese chocolate chip mixture. It adds a nice surprise to some of the cupcakes (& gives them an interesting look if that matters to you:) I also bake them at about 22-23 minutes which doesn't seem like much less time but I've found makes them a little more moist. This is one of my favorite dessert recipes, hands-down!

This recipe was delicious, but a bit too "wet" for my taste. I really enjoy super moist cakes but i don't think i will add the cream cheese filling anymore unless i fold it into the cake mix itself, then i am afraid it wouldn't bake properly. With slight modifications this could be a 5 star recipe.

This recipe is so quick and easy to make. I particularly love how the chocolate chips give it a surprisingly gooey centre. I usually make only half of the chocolate recipe, while still using all of the cheesecake recipe. This way, I have an almost equal chocolate-to-cheesecake ratio that yields 18 scrumptious "chocolate 'n cheesecake" cupcakes. Kudos, Kellygurll!

My husband and I adore these. I have another recipe for a similar cupcake that has peanut butter in the center. The chocolate chips are the perfect touch!

This recipe was great, I added a little more cheesecake center to each, they are great if chilled or left overnight!

I made these and they are delicious.  I took them to work and even those who do not like chocolate loved them - the cream cheese filling is wonderful.  I took the advice of others and poured in batter, then filling, then rest of batter.  Definitely will make again.  Want to try as a bundt cake.

These are awesome cupcakes! I made them for a girl at my work's birthday but they didn't last long enough for me to take them to her. My family ate them all! The cupcakes alone are delicious, but the filling just pushes them over the top.

The cake part of this recipe was very good - it's the standard vegan chocolate cake recipe.  I used only 2 t of vinegar, though, because 1 T was more than I'd seen in other versions of this.  I used soy milk instead of water - I would suggest that for people concerned that it wasn't moist enough.  My problem was one that is not the fault of the recipe: I had to try to make the filling vegan, too.  Others commented that the filling was too runny and without an actual egg, it was really bad.  I'm going to try them again with no egg, no egg replacer except maybe a 1 t of corn starch and 1 of baking powder.  Good luck to others trying similar substitutions...

I just made these and ate one. The cupcake itself was pretty mediocre, and the cream cheese filling was pretty unnoticeable. The top came out to be extremely crunchy for some reason. The texture of the rest was good. The cream cheese filling was fully a liquid when making it. It would have been much easier to use if it were more creamy and fluffy, as the recipe had implied. I chose to top mine with a simple buttercream icing, flavored with vanilla and a hint of almond. Honestly, the frosting tastes better than the cupcake. The cupcake is a bit too bland, also, so the frosting is what stands out. I wouldn't recommend a frosting for these, unless it is extremely light.   I will not make these again.

I made these for my neighbors. They said they were the best cupcakes they ever had, my husband also loved them with or without the chocolate chips. No one can believe they are low in calories because of the taste. I like not having to use egg in case you are low in ingredients and it helps cut the calories. The cupcakes come out moist and the cream cheese is a little tart. I added 1 tspn vanilla extract to the cream cheese to cut down on the tartness for the filling.

These cupcakes are sinfully delicious!!!! I made a simple vanilla frosting to go on top, which just added to the sweetness.    When I got down to the last bit of batter, I decided to just mix the chocolate and the cream cheese mixture to see what would happen-- they turned out more "muffin-like..."  Although they still tasted great, I LOVED the original version-- the way it was supposed to be with the cream cheese in the center.  Absolutely marvelous. :D

I made these for a birthday at work and everyone raved.  I did follow past reviews and layered the chocolate, then cream cheese layer and finally the chocolate again.  Rather than trying to spoon it in, I used a large ziplock bag and poured the chocolate mixture in, sealed it and cut a small corner off to use like a cake decorator bag.  Made it much easier and less messy.  I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture and ended up sprinkling some on top before going in the oven and it was fine.

cupcakes were dry and only tasty where the cream cheese was. something should be done about the chocolate part of the recipe to make it moist. very disappointing.

These were pretty tasty. I did not have any cocoa powder so I replaced with carob powder. Worked out great. You definetly need to let them cool before you move them much as they will crumble apart.

I halved the recipe. Used cider vinegar and low fat cream cheese. I made them into mini muffins. I got about 20 out of them. Perfect for just the two of us.

i agree with somebody that said that she has made many good recipes from this site but this is the first recipe that totally deserves the effort of writing a review......these cupcakes are AMAZING and were a hit among my friends! i didn't change a thing and the result were 22 amazingly moist and delicious cupcakes.  I would even say the recipe is absolutely fool-proof because i left one batch in the oven for like 35 minutes and they were still moist and yummy!! i would just half the recipe of the filling because you would need two batches of the chocolate mix to get to use all the filling. I will be making these cupcakes again and again!!

I was just looking for a simple chocolate cupcake recipe and fell upon this one! I didn't do the cream cheese center and these turned out wonderful! Not extremely sweet nor over the top chocolaty. They're quite perfect. :) I even noticed that this was eggless. A nice vegan recipe. I think next time I will even substitute apple sauce for the vegetable oil to make it even lower in fat!

It wasn't bad but maybe I should have made the in cupcakes...  I made one big cake hoping it'd turn out kind of like marble cake.  The filling wasn't enough or maybe I didn't do a good job.  Most of filling got mixed with chocolate cake....

I really like these cupcakes. I made it according to recipe, though instead of vinegar I used lemon juice (which worked out fine). I was about to give up on them halfway because the batter takes ages to spoon into the tins without getting batter all over the kitchen, but after making the first batch I quickly finished up the rest. They have a rich chocolate taste and the cream cheese filling gives it just the right contrast. Very yummy. I also only baked them for about 20 minutes. Next time I'd probably halve the ingredients (I got 36 cupcakes, could easily have made over 40 as there was remaining batter). I'd also try to find real cupcake tins - we don't really have that kind of baking items in Denmark that I've seen. It might make them easier to make!

I used a cake mix and filled 1/3 of the cupcake, then the cheese filling (which is great, I only think it could use a bit less salt), and then the other 1/3 of cake mix.  I got 30 cupcakes. Refrigerated them in a sealed container overnight, they are delicious right out of the fridge, the chocolate chips are the best part, thanks for the recipe!

These cupcakes were the hit of our "Death by Chocolate Day".  They were wonderfully moist and the center added that extra richness that melted in your mouth.  I added to half of my cupcakes a ganache topping for that extra chocolate extravagance. Both with and without the topping the cupcakes were scrumptious.  I had to make the cupcakes in half batches because I only had one muffin pan for 12.  I was worried that the batter would be ruined while I left the bowl on the counter waiting for the first batch to bake. But that was not a problem the second batch of cupcakes baked just as well as the first batch. This is a spectacular recipe!!!

I love this recipe!  The only problems I had was that they came out a touch more done than I like, so I may cut the cook time to 18-20 minutes, and they stuck to the liners.  Next time I'll try using cooking spray in the liners to remedy this.

These cupcakes are SUPER! My boyfriend loved them! The only thing I did different was: I put the chocolate chips in the batter, rather than the cream cheese, and I made cream cheese icing, rather than adding the eggs and salt (for fear the cupcakes would be too cakey and rich). PERFECT!

I followed the directions exactly!  I did though put the cream cheese filling in between the cake and topped with store bought cream cheese frosting.  They definately taste better the next day for some reason.  I had one right when they cooled and didn't think they were chocolately enough but the next day they were AWESOME!!  So would suggest to make the night before and eat the next day.  Yummy!!!

These were good, but I thought they were a little too dense in texture.  I topped them with chocolate glaze.

Made this, but cheated and used Betty Crocker Milk Chocolate cake mix for the chocolate cake part.  Next time I might use a slightly darker chocolate cake mix, but even as they were, these were absolutely delicious!  I called them "New Year's Eve Cupcakes," sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top, and voila!  Perfection!

Not at all what I expected...more like "cheesecake cupcakes." I did cheat and use a chocolate cake box mix. I personally did not care for these, but the others did.

Very yummy tasting. I took them to work for a Halloween treat. Everyone loved them! Ok, am I the only one who thought the cream cheese filling would puff up and look just like the one in the photo? I made these because I loved the picture. Was very sad to see that I was silly enough to think that mine would be as fluffy and pretty as the one in the photo. Still, they tasted good and my co-workers thought I was a genius to have white ghosts on my cupcakes for Halloween! Very yummy, just don't be fooled by the picture as I was. Thanks

Excellent cupcakes! Did not change a thing, and definitely didn't need any icing. Strange thing is.. these tasted just ok out of the oven, but after sitting for about 5 hours were elevated to spectacular status! Thanks for the great recipe--I will make these again!

I have made these twice now, once for my family the other for my Mums & tots group and both times a complete success. The mums thought they'd been 'professionally' made!!! I added the cream cheese frosting I recipe from this site cos I wanted them to look just like the pic, and you know what... they really did. Will def make again and again...

These cupcakes are amazing!!!  My girls 3 and 7 and I made these the other day.  They loved helping mom and these were so easy.  I did lower the oven temp to 325 and I did a layer of chocolate, then the cream cheese mix then topped with the chocolate as suggested by other reviews.  These were fantasitic.  I even did some with cashews and others with walnuts for my husband.  They were a huge hit here.  I got 24 exactly.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!

Easy to make, very moist and tasty! Next time I'll try to add some (frozen) berries - for example blue berries or red current - to the filling. I think it would be even more delicious with that extra acid and freshness :-)

My husband tells me these are the best cupcakes he's ever had. I made the recipe exactly as stated and they turned out great! I put the cupcakes in a gallon ziplock back after they'd cooled. I'm not sure what happened, but they seem to taste even more moist and delicious the next day. Kind of like a fantastic Hostess cupcake, but replace the gross filling with a deliciously addictive filling.

I halved the recipe to make 1 dozen and I added chocolate chips to the chocolate part.  For the filling I used whipped cream cheese and the white from one egg.  I beat the filling with a mixer and it blended really quick.  I layered the mixtures like other reviewers recommended.  I used foil cupcake liners and they worked just fine.  To chill the cupcakes quick since I wanted to serve them an hour later, first I cooled the cupcake pan on a cooling rack for about 15 minutes.  Then I removed the cupcakes in the liners and put them in a glass rectangular pan, which just fit into my side by side freezer.  I chilled them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before transporting them at room temperature and they tasted fine.  If I had more time, I would have cooled them longer on the cooling rack and longer in the freezer (or refrigerator), since I think the cream cheese center is better chilly (just like with cheese cake).  Next time I might try white chocolate chips in the filling.  These were a big hit.  Yum, yum.

I grew up with this at every birthday!
We called it Surprise Filling Cake. And our Creamcheese filling also included Caramel that was cut up with the choclate chips, also for a slight variation you can subsitute the chocolate chips for peanutbutter ones!

These are now a favorite of my Army detachment.  I made these one day, and brought them in.  People confessed to eating four or five of these in the day, and I had to fight my room mate off with the wooden spoon.  They are amazinly good, though very rich.  One note is that I ended up with a LOT more cupcakes than the recipe listed (about 34).  I frosted them with a cream cheese frosting, which went great with the chocolate.  Mmmm...

My co-workers, husband and myself absolutely LOVED these!  Will definitely make again!  The only thing I would do would be try to layer the creamcheese mixture between the chocolate, as another reader suggested, b/c it didn't sink into the cupcake, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Went nicely with a little bit of pink buttercream icing for Valentine's Day!

I tried it to make it as one review said. Put just half to paper cups add the filling and then pour other half over. I loved the batter, but was not really impresed with the filling. Next time I will try these without the filling just add the chocolate chips. It was very good with the Butter cream frosting II with few adjustment. Will definetely make these again just without the filling.

Very nice taste and texture indeed and quick to make. However when cool I covered the top which sink a little because of the cream cheese with cream cheese frosting, whipped ganache or whip cream.

These are AMAZING!! I did make a couple of changes though. I used apple cider vinegar b/c that's all I had on hand. I added 3/4 cup of sugar and about 1/4 - 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter to sweeten it. They came out wonderfully. Next time I will probably make more filling, b/c I made 24 cupcakes and only had enough filling for about 20. I had some batter left over too and probably could have made more if I had more filling.

These were okay.  I think they were a bit mushy.  But I like the cream cheese mixture.  I also added chocolate chips to the main dough and it really helped make it more chocolat-y.  I think these would have tasted better with a cream cheese frosting.

O these are wonderful! I was worried about them not being sweet enough so what I did was add chocolate morsels to the batter. The cream mixture also added a delightful suprise. I took them to a bible study group and the people loved them. I would say this recipe is a hit.

These were sooooo yummy! I made them lighter by substituting Splenda 
Sugar Blend for Baking, applesauce instead of oil, fat free cream cheese, and mini chocolate chips. They still tasted AWESOME and they only had 173 calories per cupcake. The only thing that disappointed me was that the cream cheese didn't sink into the middle of the cupcake like in the picture. It really didn't matter though! They just look more like a cupcake w/icing that way. TRY THESE! They're great!

The chocolate cake  is so good and moist and chocolaty, and the cream cheese inside is a little extra yum without too much sweet! The chocolate chips are delightful!

I thought these cupcakes were pretty good! I decided to try a different way of filling the cupcakes. I put the cream cheese mixture in a sandwich bag, cut a large hole, and squeezed the mixture into the center of the cupcakes. It was pretty successful, but the chocolate chips were clumping together a lot. I recommend adding the cream cheese filling my way and adding the chocolate chips with your fingers.

Absolutely amazing. Mine were very moist and sweet. Almost like eating a puddingcake. I didnt have choclate chips on hand though, so i melted some semisweetchocolate and mixed itinto the batter. So mine didnt have a chocolate center but a sort of automatic frosting. Very nice. will try chocolate chips next time.

I loved this recipe, I found it very moist and will definetly make it again! I added extra sugar into the cream cheese mixture but found it didn't have a cream cheese flavour, it was just really creamy. I made 16 and had alot leftover so I made a pie with the left overs, it was very yummy but had to be cooked for about 40 min. ,with the cupcakes I took other reviewers advice and only cooked for 20 min.

This recipe was definitely not sweet enough for me.  The sweetest part is the chocolate chips.  I don't know what should be done to make it sweeter, but it needs it.

Another reviewer mentioned a 20 minute bake is enough.  I agree.  20 did it for me.

This were very delicious!  These are the first cupcakes I've had that didn't need frosting and still tasted great.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular size and it worked out just fine.  Also I got about 32 out of this recipe instead of 24.

12 of these dont last 4 days in my  house w my family of 3, I make it exactly, the first time I had to use powdered sugar instead of reg for the cream cheese filling and either way taste the same, the choc cupcake is so  amazingly moist, the only thing is  I fill my cupcake pan almost full of the choc and put as much xtra I can fit of the cream cheese filling.. and I use a big muffin pan so my muffins are always bigger...

This recipe is fantastic!! The cupcakes were so moist and perfect! The only thing different that I did was that I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I'm not sure how much of a difference that made. I will be using this recipe all the time!

easy to make, yummy to eat. don't look that great but i knew that going into it, i think it's part of their charm. It's worth mentioning all the black bottom cupcakes on this sight have exactly the same ingredients, except this one which simply has double the chocolate batter...

I made these exactly as directed.  They are bland and dry, and not chocolate tasting or sweet at all.  The cream cheese filling was not sweet either.  This needs a complete overhaul to make it palatable.  They also look very plain and "naked" without a frosting or glaze.  And if you try a recipe, adjusting it along the way, and then rate it, it is NOT a true rating.  Almost every review with 4 or 5 stars has major adjustments in documented in the review.  It's not fair to the person submitting the recipe or the viewers who would like to try it and don't know which adjustment to follow.

I have made these many times because they are always requested by my kids! So easy to make and great because you don't need to frost them. The filling is wonderful and sometimes my children will heat the cupcakes up. They are enjoyed right out of the oven.

I couldn't find my recipe for these so used this one. Definitely not as good as what we're used to. I agree with some of the others that cake without eggs is going to be chewy. Hopefully I find my recipe!

Excellent,  they  puffed up beautifully, much, much better than any mix.  Swirled the mixture a bit & tossed a maple bud on top.

I made these for Valentine's Day.  They were delicious - so moist and rich.  I halved the recipe, but ran into trouble with 1 egg for the cream cheese topping.  I ended up adding more cream cheese and adding a very generous dollop to each cupcake.  This recipe will definitely be made again.  Without the cream cheese, it would make a very good cake.

"I can die a happy man, now that I've had one of these cupcakes" so said one of my co-workers. I followed recipe as is and this cupcake recipe is AMAZING and probably the best cupcake I've ever had. Not only are they wonderful warm and gooey from the oven (like a mini lava cake), but once they cool, they are like having a bit of cheesecake with your
cupcake. We make these often in our household.

Fantastic recipe!  Not too sweet. Perfect to freeze, and pull out when you're craving a little something chocolate!

I love these!  Such a nice change from the standard cupcake.  I've made them for my son's birthday party and will be doing so again this year.  Everyone raved about them, and the leftovers were gobbled up in just a few days. They're also great with a cream cheese frosting or butter cream.

My daughter has been requesting black bottom cupcakes for a couple of weeks.  I couldn't find the recipe I used several years back so decided to try this one based on the ratings and reviews.  The chocolate chips in the cream cheese batter were an extra treat.  Certainly not a lo-cal dessert, but delicious all the same. I followed the recipe exactly and did put one third batter in each paper cup, then cream cheese mixture and topped with remaining batter. My daughter was very happy with dessert tonight.  I'd just note that there was enough batter and cream cheese filling for at least 4 more cupcakes had I not filled the papers to almost overflowing.

This was a great recipe! I made them for my family and friends and everybody loved them. The only thing I did different was I substituted 1/4 cup vegetable oil for the egg in the cream cheese mixture.

I made a batch of these this evening. Only thing that was changed was apple vinegar vs reg vinegar. If I didn't make them for coworkers, I'd have ate every last one, they are Delish! They don't need frosting, I agree with many about that, I simply did some thin line piping for appearance. I filled 1/3 with mix, added my dollop of filling, then covered with mix. Top edges were not crunchy per se but gave it character, rest was moist, chocolatey, and creamy. 20mins in oven and done! Bam!

I have tried it quite a few times. The first time I baked the cupcakes, they turned out great even though i used bicarbonate of soda instead of baking powder so i thot that the recipe was forgiving however after that i made it again 3 more times. All three times i failed even though i followed the recipe. The fourth time, i had no choco powder so i had to use a substitute.It was horrible! So I think that this was awesome but one sentence - stick to the recipe 
Thnx for the recipe :)

I have made this recipe for years, but I like a little cake with my cream cheese, so I double the cream cheese filling.  We like to eat these right out of the freezer.

Well.....the stuffing is watery and I just can't put them inside to make "surprise" cupcakes. I just put it on top. It is still good anyway.

I made these cupcakes for a birthday gathering.  I substituted coffee for the water and use mini chocolate chips.  The coffee gave the cupcakes that rich chocolate taste you look for in a chocolate cake.  These were excellent.  Will definitely make again.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top.

I just made these and followed the recipe exactly. It was just ok. Very moist, but not particularly flavorful or rich. They tasted a bit like a diet cupcake... maybe because the batter didn't have eggs? Not a total fail, but I wouldn't make them again.

This is a wonderful recipe.....my neighbor made it first with some substitutions......I made it today per recipe as a test batch for an upcoming open house.  I would like to make mini-cupcakes with this recipe but I don't know how to adjust the time for minis.......does anyone have any suggestions?  I live at high altitude :)

Prefer the one bowl chocolate cake recipe instead of this one -- this wasn't very chocolatey, and was a bit too dry for me.

Made exactly as recipe..they could have used a bit more sugar and I just put a dollop of the cream cheese on top of each cupcake.  Next time I would increase the sugar a bit (honey maybe?) and will probably use a teaspoon to push the dollop down into the center of each cupcake.  Kids liked them pretty well and they were good with a cup of coffee.

Easy, excellent cupcakes.  I have to admit I cheated and used a box mix since I did not have all the cupcake ingredients on hand, but I followed the filling mix recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I had quite a bit of extra filling left over, so don't be afraid to use heaping teaspoons of filling for each cupcake.

These cupcakes come out delicious every time and are a huge hit in my household. Everyone especially loves the frosting inside. We sometimes put vanilla frosting on top which tastes especially delicious. These are tasty, moist and delicious - I would encourage everyone to try them.

This recipe was fine and all, but it was not amazing. I did what many other reviewers said and put the filling in the center of each cupcake. I also baked the cupcakes for 20 minutes instead of 25 minutes since it seemed a bit too long. I really liked how the cupcakes came out, so I gave it a four, but the flavor wasn't amazing. I suppose it's because I'm not really a fan of chocolate cupcakes, but I'm sure there are some who would really enjoy this recipe though. I also thought there was a bit too much sugar, so I would cut down the sugar in the cupcakes to 1 - 1/2 cups if I were to make these again. This is still a great, easy recipe :)

This was my first attempt at making homemade cupcakes and I will never go back to buying cupcake mix! These cupcakes were so good! Everyone loved them. I also put the cream cheese mixture between the cupcake mixture and it turned out excellent. Also, I took them out at 20 minutes instead of 25.

This is the best recipe for these cupcakes. It just isn't the same when using a box mix. No egg & adding vinegar make the perfect combination for the rich filling. My husband wants this every birthday!

Yummy! Exact ingredients used. Did both ways, chocolate mixture at bottom and topped with cream cheese mix and swirl, and cream cheese mixture between choc mixture. More people prefer the swirling of cream cheese on top, but both are delicious.

Yum!  I overfilled them and had trouble with the cupcakes overflowing and getting stuck to my muffin tin - totally my fault!  I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting to improve the asthetics since I made these for a baby shower - they were great!  Everybody loved them and I will certainly make them again.  I had extra cream cheese filling so I put together a graham cracker crust in mini muffin tins and filled them with the cream cheese filling and baked them off - I got about 8 little cheesecakes - delish!

I followed the recipe completely except that I stuck the cream cheese filling in between two chocolate layers.  Everyone raved about them, even those who usually don't love dessert!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Wow! I added more chocolate chips than anybody should and it was awesome. (In the middle around the filling and on top.) Very easy to make and tasted just delicious. I added canned frosting to some which wasn't to my taste but others liked it. Filling didnt stay moist but tasted good nonetheless. I think the recipe made me about 30 cupcakes.

I mis-proportioned the filling in each cupcake, but they still tasted great! I tried to add some raspberries to the filling, frost them and put a raspberry on top...next time I'd add more raspberries to the filling, I didn't do enough, but they still looked and tasted great!

Yummy!  I like my sweets with as little sugar possible without sacrificing the taste so I think this recipe is on the sweet side.  I use only 2/3s of the amount of sugar suggested for the cupcake. Most of the sweetness comes from the filling and for me that's enough.  "A heaping teaspoonful" of the cream cheese mixture wouldn't have been enough if I had followed those directions. The filling has a consistency slightly thicker than milk. I used 2 - 3 teaspoons each. You could probably go up to 4 teaspoons.  I used only the egg whites and that turned out to be a great decision because the filling comes out looking white, not off-white or lightish yellow like I see in some of the photos. So what I got were sort of black and white cupcakes that I think look really neat.   I also used a toothpick to swirl the filling on top. Either that, or I bake it 2/3s of the way, add sprinkles and bake it until it's done.

Very tasty.  I wish the 'surprise' would of went down more into the middle of the cupcake.  But still very good.  I topped with cream cheese frosting.

Great recipe! I noticed that the cake recipe is vegan, so I wanted to try a vegan-friendly filling. I diced up some strawberries and added them to each cup before baking. My friends loved them so much I didn't even get to taste one! They're really good without any filling at all, too!

I just made these last night and they're yummy! However, I didn't expect the batter to be so runny and kept mixing (for fear of loads of flour unmixed at the bottom of the mixing bowl). I think that might have contributed to a less fluffy and light cupcake.   The chocolate flavour however was fab! The cheese filling seemed a little too much - I had to put less than a tablespoon of the filling into each cupcake.

Hey gang, this recipe makes me think of canolli. What if we were to use mascarpone as the filling in stead of the cream cheese? I'd love to hear back on that one.

amazing recipe. the first time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good but the second time I made some changes to make it better . 1- I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 +1/2 cup white sugar. 2- one cup of fat free milk instead of one cup of water. 3- used 1/3 less fat cream cheese , I think I`ll use the fat free the next time .- added 1/4 cup more of cocoa powder, 5- I added the cream cheese mixture on top of the cupcakes then added just 1 TBS of the cake mixture , then I used the knife on the cupcake surface to make it like marble .

I've made this recipe for years, known as dalmatian cupcakes.  For the best results, make as directed.  Make sure that you use Philadelphia cream cheese. The store brands do not work as well. I can never get the cream cheese smooth & creamy with them & they don't taste as well.  These cupcakes are a favorite for pot lucks & family get togethers.  I always just dump a spoonful of filling in the middle, some white usually shows but it looks nice that way.  I sometimes make a chocolate frosting anyway.  When people bit into this, they are always surprised!!!!

I made these on valentines day and took them to my boyfriend's work and all 2 dozen were gone before I left! I added a little more cream cheese to each and they turned out great I got the best compliment "don't make these ever again, they're way too good"!

Amazing. SO decadent. I topped them with a rich cream cheese frosting to make them even more sinful (2 sticks butter, 8 oz package cream cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla). I was surprised that the "filling" came out sort of cake-like, because it looked like pudding going in. But it was perfect! Will definitely make again.

This is my first review..but I must say these cupcakes were GREAT!! I read some previous reviews and actually did 1/3 batch and put the cream cheese mixture inside to actually create the surprise. I didn't think they needed any frosting. My mom likes the batter and is used the remaining batter to make a cake. We made 24 cupcakes. Good thing I tried this at my parent's home, because 24 cupcakes is WAY too much for me!! Next time I think I will try it as a cake instead of cupcakes..great recipe!

these were yummy but I couldn't really taste the cream cheese center! I frosted half w/ a cream cheese frosting that I added peppermint extract to which gave them a fresh taste. I frosted the other half w/ a plain vanilla frosting and they also tasted good.

These were only Okay for me. Edible, but all of the rave reviews had my hopes up high. I personally thought that they tasted better strait out of the oven as they were nice and moist and just the perfect sweetness as written. But over night, the tops became crunchy and the crunchy tops, moist center combination was just weird. I would definitely use a whip cream, or cream cheese frosting with this next time. You definitely don't want to use a frosting that is too sweet. I used a chocolate butter cream frosting and the sweetness and flavor of the frosting was overpowering and detracted from the flavor of the cupcakes.

I followed this recipe to the T except for hiding the filling in the middle. I was very disappointed with these cupcakes. The chocolate part was okay but I did not like the cream cheese filling at all. It had the texture of scrambled eggs and I did not like the flavor. I waited the next day like some reviews said to do but it did not get any better. I made some buttercream frosting (from this site) which was really good but did not improve the cupcakes enough.

A very nice cupcake recipe!  Moist and not overly sweet, but sweet enough.  I made exactly as written, although like others I put a little batter in the bottom of the muffin cup, added the filling, and then topped with more batter.  This does make a lot - I got 30 cupcakes.  There is plenty of filling, so you don't need to be overly conservative with it.  I ended up having some left at the end.  I frosted these with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Icing from this site and they are quite delicious that way!

Super good. The cake was just right. Not too moist, and not too dry. I used dark cocoa, it made them look super rich without tasting too rich.  And yes, you absolutly have to wait till the next day to eat them.  The cheese filling recipe is just like your basic cheesecake recipe.  And anyone who has ever made a cheesecake would know it tastes better the next day. :) So make them ahead of time. I just wish the cake batter wasnt so runny. I made a mess.  Awsome recipe.  TY!

Yummy cupcakes! How can you go wrong with chocolate cupcakes? The only modification that i made was used orange juice in place of the water and added about a tbl of vanilla. I filled the cups about 1/3 of the way with the chocolate batter, then added the cream cheese mixture, and covered that with another 1/3 of the batter. Cooked only 20 minutes, which is plenty of time. Topped with an orange cream cheese frosting. If you can get piping bags, or just use a ziploc bag and cut a corner, you have more control placing the batter and cream cheese mixture into the cups. BTW, this recipe makes 36 cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe!

These cupcakes were delicious! I made them for everyone at work for a birthday in the office, then dipped them in chocolate ganache instead of the typical icing. They didn't come out quite as sweet as I expected, but that ended up more to my liking. I added a little cinnamon and cayenne pepper to add my own special touch :-)

SO good! This is the best cupcake recipe I've tried so far. I was getting discouraged when all of the past ones I made turned out mediocre. These ones turned out perfect. Perfect texture, taste, everything. I added orange extract instead of vanilla because I love the combination of orange and chocolate. It was amazing.

This is my absolute favorite chocolate cupcake. It came out very moist and lasted four days. I see why this recipe did not call for frosting. It was amazing with the cream cheese filling!

Sadly, I'm allergic to cocoa and cocoa products, so I couldn't eat these cupcakes as they are, but a close friend made me one, just one, vanilla one. It was awesome, and all he did was apparently leave out the cocoa and chocolate chips. Sadly, I only had one, but I am soooo making these now!!

this was a huge hit at work, my boss got a little annoyed because she brought cookies the same day that were partially burned, so she thought i was making her look bad! haha. this is definitely a keeper.

by the way, it says that you're supposed to beat the cream cheese mixture until its 'light and fluffy'. am i the only one who cant get mine 'light and fluffy'?? anyways, they tasted fine the way i made them, so maybe i won't worry too much about it.

I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 2 cups of whole wheat flour. You could still taste and smell the wheat flour, but it was delicious anyway. Also, hooray for a recipe that doesn't require a mixer!

These are excellent, very moist and fudgy. They do not need frosting - but probably need to be rationed so you don't eat too many of them at one time cuz they are addictive.

Absolutely fantastic! I used half the oil and replaced the other half with unsweetened applesauce. These are definitely better the next day; immediately out of the oven, they just taste sweet. They don't need a frosting, which makes them ideal for transport. A keeper!

My kids made these tonight to go with dinner. They were wonderful! We served with chocolate swirl icecream. The only change was milk chocolate chips rather than semi sweet. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a bake sale for school and it was a hit! It was the number one seller. I used dark chocolate cocoa and filled the middle with dark cherry preserves and used store-bought cream cheese frosting and dusted the tops with cocoa. I have made 3 batches in the past three days and can't keep them from being eaten! The only problem I saw was that I am sensitive to the taste of baking soda in my foods, and was able to taste the baking soda. But after 1 day in the fridge, it went away.

oh this is so good!! i love them. I have never been a big fan of cupcake, but when i tried this one, omigod, this taste so good. the combination of the chocolate and the cream cheese blends beautifully without ruining each individual taste. thank you for sharing :)

Love this recipe. The second batch looked much more like a surprise was in the middle than my first. Not sure how that happened, but they were a hit with everyone I shared them with. Not too sweet but absolutely yummy!

very disappointing.  if not for the chocolate chips in the center, it would not have been sweet enough.

Yummy!!  The cream cheese/chocolate center is a great suprise and makes them creamy and rich.  If you make for Halloween, the cream cheese looks like a ghost after baked.

I wasn't a huge fan of these, but my family liked them. I added more sugar as someone had suggested, and also more chocolate chips. Maybe that had something to do with it. If I made it again I would leave out the chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe though!

These are really fantastic! Everyone who tries them can't get enough. Especially my husband. I do recommend adding more sugar. Up to a full cup more. With the recipe as is, there is not a lot of sweetness there at all. But this is a really great recipe!

Cupcakes were very tasty but they were not very moist.
