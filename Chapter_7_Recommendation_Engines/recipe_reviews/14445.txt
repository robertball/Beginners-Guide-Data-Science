I think the serving size listed for this recipe is incorrect.  It says: serves 6.  Two pounds of spinach is a huge amount, even as the main meal, this would probably feed more.  

Assuming you're serving it as a side salad, this recipe (using 2 lbs of spinach) should feed about 24 people.  

I scaled this recipe back to get the correct amount needed for 6 people (I would allow one egg per person though).  It worked great.  I would strongly suggest that you make your own croutons using the GARLIC CROUTON recipe submitted by Cathy Hofmann.  It's wonderful!!
Time saving tips: 1. don't use a blender, put everything into a wide mouth bottle (like a 16 oz Gatorade bottle) and shake it up.  No blender to clean and you can toss the bottle! 
2. use REAL bacon already cooked and crumbled at the store.

Very good recipe!  I took the suggestions of cutting down the sugar about 1/2.  It turned out great...

This was very good. My husband who normally will not touch spinach loved it. I did add more mushrooms.

This is a great spinach salad recipe.   Especially for those of us who live in a warm climate (FL) and don't need a "hot dressing" all the time.  I used a red onion the first time I made the recipe, and the dressing came out a nice pink color in contrast to the green spinach.  One egg per person is the way to go, and I only used one bag of spinach for six people.

WOW!  What a salad.  I have made this so many times and the bowl is always empty!!  I have also used the dressing on other in other salads.  The dressing is great on plain lettuce.  I usually use bacon that is precooked from the store and have also added feta cheese, almonds and dried cranberries to this salad. I do not use a blender to make the dressing, just a jar and a good shake!

Absolutely OUTSTANDING. I too made some changes, but loved it and my wife drooled over it. I used Balsamic Vinegar and didn't have Celery seed so used sesame instead. Will most defiately be making again. Would rate this as a 10 if it were available.

My gang loves spinach and salad so this was great for us. Other than using baby spinach leaves, I didn't change a thing. This recipe is also good with the hot bacon dressing which is on this site. Yum, and thanks!

Don't look for other recipes.  This is the one you were searching for!  The dressing is excellent, although a drop sweet.  I skipped the bacon.  Used scallions instead of onion.  Quick and easy to prepare and certain to be finished in one meal!

Excellent recipe!  I made it easy by using, pre-washed and bagged baby spinach, pre sliced mushrooms, and pre-cooked bacon.  The dressing was excellent and the hit of the party I took it to.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks

Loved it, this is my kinda salad!  I used red onion, and cut the sugar amount in the dressing to maybe 3/4 tsp. (I cut the recipe down to 1 serving).  I will make this again, and share with my 11 year old, who LOVES spinach as well.  Thanks Dee!

Really good! I really liked the dressing, and so did my family.  I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have any mushrooms.  Still so good, even without the mushrooms!

I followed this recipe all except for I did not have mushrooms and I don't like celery seed. It was very good!! Instead of mixing everything together I plated it separately: first spinach, then eggs and bacon, then croutons, then dressing. I made my own croutons with italian bread, butter, parmesan cheese, and italian seasoning. The dressing is the BEST part of this recipe, with no celery seed, of course. Although another reviewer suggested using sesame seed and I think that would have been good. I will get some for next time.

My new favorite salad!!!! I could not stop eating this... I used 1/2 a red onion, put sliced red onions in the salad, omitted the egg, used garlicky croutons. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. SO good..the dressing is fabulous. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

My husband & I, who are not big salad eaters can't get enough of this!  I've made this several times and  we always devour it.  I do cut back on the sugar in the dressing and I think using the sweeter onion is key.

Love this salad! I used red onion as I thought that's where the Bermuda part of the name came from. It adds a nice bite to the salad. I skipped the croutons (there aren't good gluten-free alternatives currently), replacing them with beets. And the sweet & sour dressing really helps to round out the salad.  (As an aside:  If I made the PA Dutch version of the dressing...bacon grease would replace part of the vegetable oil and it would be gently warmed to melt the sugar within the dressing to help marry the flavors). Thank you Dee for sharing this recipe.

I didn't like this much and I am a spinach lover. The dressing made the croutons soggy and the egg seemed out of place. I ate the ingredients seperately, but didn't like it together.

I have made this salad so many times and it is always a huge hit. I make the dressing exactly as it is in the recipe, but I don't use the other ingredients. I simply use baby spinach, Craisins, and cooked crumbled bacon. Once the dressing is made, you've got a quick easy salad- and it tastes absolutely amazing.

I absolutly love this recipe and it is so good to bring to parties or dinners! The only thing that I would recommend is to wait and toss the dressing into the salad until right before serving so it doesn't get "soggy".

Very good salad. I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider and that worked well. I did cut the sugar in half and used a sweet onion. Thanks.

Absolutely the best dressing!!  You could probably cut the sugar a bit-  we like a sweet dressing, though.  For those people who thought the onion flavor was too strong, perhaps you used red onion.  If you use a sweet white onion, like Bermuda or Maui, it is divine.

I cut the sugar by half, used organic apple cider vinegar, and it was just right--not too sweet, and definitely a nice play between the onion, sugar, and spinach.

This recipe as is, is ok. I think the 2 lbs of spinach was meant to be 2 bags, but even that seemed like a lot. I used approximately 12 oz of spinach. The dressing had a nice flavor to it, but WAY too much onion, and I love onion! This dressing burned my nose and eyes! I suggest using a very small onion or maybe only a quarter of a larger one. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still super sweet. Maybe only needs 1/3 cup.

The dressing was good but I usually make a hot bacon dressing for my spinach salads.  This looked easier so I tried it.  Doesn't compare to the hot version but is good for the ease of preparation.  I thought the onion was overwhelming but that might have been the onion I used.

Took this to a cookout and got A LOT of compliments and it was GONE (best compliment!) by the end of the evening. I used olive oil and cut the amount of oil in half and it was really really good.

So good! Served at a BBQ and everyone loved it - had to make another bowl in the middle of dinner. I added extra mushrooms and some sunflower seeds, as well as cut the oil in half in the dressing (one cup of oil is TOO much) - still tasted great.

Excellent recipe! I used only 1/2 cup sugar and the dressing was perfect. I also didn't have celery seed on hand, so I used celery leaves from the top of the stalk! It was wonderful. I also added chopped tomato, shredded cheddar cheese and green onion to the salad. And to save on time, I bought packaged real bacon bits. Everyone loved this salad! This is a new favorite salad for me.

Made this for a crowd and everyone loved it.  Good for taking to summer gatherings.  Only downside is that it won't keep overnight--croutons turn mushy.  The celery taste is very refreshing without being overpowering.  Try it!

Family loved this salad, the dressing is especially good. I used 1 medium sized Vidalia onion and it worked fine. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4C. and used 1/4C. Splenda as well. Finally, I'm allergic to wheat so I bought some gluten free hamburger buns, cut them up into cubes, tossed them with melted butter, garlic powder, s & p and baked at 300 degrees for about 25 min.... yummy! Thanks Dee for a great recipe!

This is a recipe I turn to over and over again for the salad dressing.  It is fabulous, easy, and it always gets rave reviews.  It calls for the onion to be chopped, but I just use the outer shell of an onion and throw it in whole--I am not an onion fan, but find that this is just right!  The blender purees it fine.  A++!

I've made this salad more times than I can count and am asked for the recipe every time I make it.  As for the amount of spinach, I just eyeball it, depending on the number of people I'm serving.  I don't use all of the red onion or sugar called for when preparing the dressing as it is sweet enough with about half to 2/3 the amt. of sugar.  Also, I find the onion flavor too overpowering if I use the amt. called for (prob use about half).  Otherwise, I keep everything the same and end up with a good bit of extra dressing to use later.  It's so good you could make a meal off of this salad!

Had this for Mom's birthday dinner and because the onions are blended, it was a hit. We went a little easy on the egggs and only used one bag of baby spinach.

I got this recipe in 2001 and have been using it ever since I am always asked to bring it to get togethers or make it for holidays and asked for the recipe it is delicous!   I use a red onion.  I have also made the dressing using Splenda and it came out just as good. I have added other veggies like cherry tomatoes cut in half and small cubed cucumbers

This salad is fantastic.  It is even better the next day.  The one thing I recommend is to keep the dressing on the side so that you can store any left overs for the following day.

This salad is sooo yummy!! The only thing is I made it in the morning to take to an afternoon family get-to-gether, and it wasnt NEAR as good after it sat in the fridge all day. So this is one of those salads you serve soon after you make it. But seriously devine when it was fresh!! I also cut back the oil to 1/2 of what it suggessted. MMMMM!!

Not that this recipe needs any more accolades, but here's one more...Love, love, love this salad.  Have served it for friends/family/boyfriend received raves every time.  I use baby spinach and omit the celery seed (didn't have any the very first time and found it over-powering when I used it) as well as the bacon (don't eat pork).  My boyfriend didn't believe I'd made the dressing myself!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Wow. I was licking the bowl this was so good. The dressing is to die for. Has a distinct onion flavor, but the sugar and acid from the vinegar balance it out nicely. I used red onion (which gave the dressing a pretty pink hue), but will try a sweet onion next time.  Also added a smidge of bacon grease to the dressing and threw some tomatoes into the salad. Tomatoes added great flavor and color. Delish!!

Fabulous - absolutely delicious! As recommended, I used a 1/4 of a red onion and made those lovely garlic croutons (recipe by Cathy Hofmann) and it went down a treat at a Christmas lunch! I did add feta cheese and this, along with the bacon, made it quite salty, so next time I would do without the salt. It was wolfed down so quickly - mostly by a non-vegie eater who kept going back for more! Very impressed - thank you!

This was a really good salad.  Made it for a group and was asked for the recipe by a few people.  I didn't use 2lbs of spinach (that would make a tonne!!).  I just used one package that weighed about 1/2 lb.  I also added a lot more mushrooms.  The dressing and the bacon are what make this salad great!

Just a little tip to save time. Instead of boiling the eggs, cooling the eggs, peeling the eggs, just to chop them. Simply poach the eggs in a little vinegar water, then cool and chop. No peeling involved and faster cooling time as they are not confined to the inside of the shell!

The dressing for this salad is amazing! and the combo of bacon and mushrooms with the spinach (and I added baby greens as well) is perfect.  I left out the egg just because I'm not a fan of egg in salads but overall this is a delicious recipe and will be a favorite in our house.  Everyone loved it including the 2 teenagers!

This is a great basic spinach salad. I didn't have red onion, so I used green onions. I think I will add chicken next time to make it a more complete meal.

I love different salad recipes and this one is a keeper! The flavors of all the ingredients is perfect and the dressing is just sweet enough to make it all pop! I would like to try and add some chicken next time.

This salad is so delicious!  I only used 1/4 c sugar in the dressing because I prefer it less sweet.  I left out the croutons (trying to go lo carb) and I didn't have fresh mushrooms.  I added gorgonzola and walnuts, and this salad was over the top!  Can't get enough of it, thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!!!

This is one of the best salads I've ever had! (didn't use mushrooms)  Only used one big bag of spinach and modified some of the other ingredient measurements, and ended up using half the dressing, but it came out excellent!  The dressing is wonderful.

I love this salad ! Love it ! I hate eggs so I have it without the eggs. Cynjne has it with the eggs. she preps the eggs and adds them to her portion. You have to shake the dressing as it is passed around, but it is worth it. A very good salad. DO NOT SKIP THE CELERY SEED !!!

Great salad!  The dressing is simple and tastes wonderful.  It's the dressing that truly makes this salad!  I added in some cooked chicken breast, almonds, snap peas and dried cranberries to make this great salad a main dish.  Everyone raved about it!

I tried this receipe for Easter lunch. There were 15 of us and there were no left overs.  It was WONDERFUL!!!!!  The only thing I changed was to add halves of Grape tomotoes. Everyone asked for the receipe.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I served it as a main dish with parmesan crescent rolls.  I added some avocado and next time will throw in some tomato.  I used a small yellow onion for the dressing and it was a little strong.  I'd recommend either a little less onion or maybe a sweet onion.

LOVED IT!  Cut back on the sugar, oil, and skipped the celery seed.  Added plenty of additions to the salad including:  fresh pineapple chunks, mandarin orange slices, pecans, dried cranberries, and whatever else we had in the kitchen.  Super Spinach Salad!!!!

Subbed Splenda for sugar and added 1/2 of bacon grease to blender, and this was heaven! I'm still using leftover dressing for salads.

I am not a neat cook so this one really trashed my kitchen but it was well worth it.  I took it to a church dinner and everyone raved about it.  The dressing is so good that I intend to use it on other things.  It reminds me of a dressing we got a Cape Cod for our salad and we liked it so much we skipped the mustard dip for our wings and used the dressing instead. I always wanted that recipe and think I now have it or something so close that I am satisfied.

This dressing us awesome. I used the 1/4 or so (strained) bacon grease and topped it off with veg oil to make the 1 cup. I added the oil at the end slowly, gave it a nice hold-up fullness. Any hot-bacon dressing is sweet, so this to me was not too sweet. I love that I could make this and put it in the frige rather than a last minute rush hot dressing. Thank you very much for this recipe.

One whole onion is WAY too much for this dressing.  The flavor was good but much too onion-y.   I will probably try this again with 1/4 of an onion (probably a Walla Walla or Maui sweet onion instead of the purple one I used.)

Served this as a side salad at a dinner party last night.  Was a "four thumbs up" as my husband puts it.  The dressing was excellent and a definite keeper.  I used less white sugar, less than half a cup, and as I said, it was wonderful.  Hubby is a bottled ranch dressing person and moaned about not being able to use it on the spinach salad and he turned out to be one of the biggest fans.  Thanks so much.

Outstanding!!!  I am glad I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the sugar; I used a third cup of raw sugar.  We also added some left over baked Ancho Chicken and some sprouted bread croutons.  Yummy!  My husband and I loved it!  Thanks for this recipe.

Wow! If you make this while being very sparse with the sugar, it is great. I used a sweet onion, which possibly cut my need of sugar. I halved the whole recipe and used maybe 2 tablespoons sugar tops. I don't care for croutons, so I didn't use them. Without them, I could take this to a party and not worry about them getting soggy. All the elements went so well with each other, I will make this over and over!

I made this as a light dinner (no changes) and my husband & I both loved it, delicious!  The dressing is fantastic and so easy to throw together, you can use it on all kinds of salads.  I think you could reduce the amount of sugar & onion slightly and it would still be great.

I scaled this recipe down to three people and still had lots of dressing left over.  Two pounds of spinach is a lot so I just plated out enough for three servings added one egg for each person and then drizzled the amount of dressing I thought was appropriate; the rest I'll save for my salad tomorrow.  I can see using this dressing on a spring mix salad also.  The dressing is what makes this salad so good. I have made this a few times now and still love it today I added fresh local strawberries halfed and some slice red onion OMG I loved loved loved it this way! Thanks for a great recipe.

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't use croutons or mushrooms, but still tasted great.  I'm making it for the 3rd time in a week.  (1 for family, 1 for in-laws and now 1 for party)I always have left over dressing as you don't want to soak the spinach just drizzle it.

Made this for a church event and I got way more dressing than I needed.  My dressing was very thick and kind of lumpy which wasn't as pretty as I would have preferred, but yummy nonetheless.

this was very good, but i wish i had cut back on the sugar. it was too sweet for me--next time, i'll try maybe 1/3 cup. also, i like the other reviewer's idea of adding green onions...that would be perfect.
cut back on oil a bit, cut back on sugar a lot, and this recipe would be a 'five.'
thanks!

As everyone states this is a five star winner!!!  With just a few modifications for your specfic likes this tastes great.  I cut down on the oil and drizzled it into the food processor to blend better.  And I also cut down on the onion.  No matter what you do to this recipe it is a winner for sure.  Thanks for sharing!

wonderful all the way around. i too cut back to 1/8 of red onion, as the amount in the recipe overwhelmed the dressing, in my opinion. this is truly a five star all recipes salad!! you will not have leftovers. also put all the dressing ingredients in my kitchen aid processor and drizzled in the ENOVA oil and the dressing was PERFECT!!

It was so yummy!  Fast and easy too.  I always keep pre-cooked bacon in my freezer (I buy it from Sam's Club because it's a great time saver and no mess way to add flavor to dishes). I also keep boiled eggs handy too.  So this took all of 7 minutes to put together.

Wonderful! Recipe serves alot more than 6.  Used half the spinach and added a little iceberg lettuce for color, omitted the egg and added pecans and mandarin oranges.  Dressing was wonderful.  Unclear on how much onion to use and what type of onion, I used a little over a quarter of a vadalia onion and turned out wonderful!

This is a very tasty dressing if you enjoy onions. I cut the recipe in half and used a generous slice of red onion and WOW was it strong; my eyes watered as I tossed the salad! I will defineitely make this recipe again, but I will cut back on the onion portion and try a less potent variety!

This was great!  I really like the dressing... tangy!  I changed it a bit by adding more eggs.  I did not have enough spinach, so I added fresh broccoli instead.  I skipped the celery seed. Did not have it.  I actually used large bread crumbs instead of croutons. Very easy. Very good. PS: Frozen spinach will work if that's all you have.  Fresh is better.

I didn't try the salad, but the dressing was good.  I did change it a bit though.  I was weary about using a whole onion based on otehr peoples' reviews.  So, I used 1/4 of a medium sized onion.  I also used extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and balsamic vinegar in place of the cider vinegar.  It turned out really good.  It was a tad salty though. I had to add extra oil and vinegar to make it less salty.  Next time I make this, I will cut the salt in half.  Note: Try it without the sugar.  It is even better.

Loved this too.  My daughter who would never eat spinach asked me for this recipe.  It went over very well for family and friends.  I added crumbled blue cheese, mandarin oranges, walnuts and Cathy Hoffman's garlic croutons Yummy!  Will make again for Christmas.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving dinner and it was wonderful. Originally met with suspicion and doubt (from those who "don't like spinach"), this turned out to be the star member of the holiday menu. I've been called upon to make it again and again since!

We loved this recipe.  It does have a strong onion taste so be forewarned. I added far less sugar than called for and the dressing was still divine!  I will be making this for a long time!

Everyone loved this!  I'm a vegan, so I just skipped the egg and bacon for me, but my hubby and kids ate the recipe as-is.  We were all very, very happy. I did go with the reviews that reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.

The sauce seemed to be lacking in kick. I would maybe add more vinegar or use onion powder as well. Overall, though, it was a great salad, and much enjoyed; it's nice just to have something a little different.

Awesome!  I added chopped walnuts and danish blue cheese to the salad, and it was outstanding.  Used red onion and it made the dressing a lovely pink color, but the onion flavor was a bit overwhelming.  I will use less onion next time, and I promise you, next time will be very soon!!

I rated this 5 stars for the salad dressing. I cut the sugar in half, and left the onion out of the dressing. I served this on a traditional spinach salad with red onion, bacon, and hard boiled eggs. Delicious.

I loved this salad!! It was sooo good!! Although I do agree that 2lbs is too much spinach! So I cut it down to one lbs. The dressing was really good although I would recommend cutting down on the onion just a bit. Will definitely make it again! =) Thank you for sharing!

I cut down on the sugar a bit but it was still plenty sweet. Used balsamic vinegar because that's all I had. This salad was SOOOO GOOD!! It's a meal all by itself. Will be making this for the family when I go to visit. Thank you!

This recipe is really good, but I wouldn't call it a celery seed dressing - more like an onion vinagrette.  That doesn't sound good but it actually compliments the spinach salad very well!  I made 1/2 the amount of the dressing and next time may cut the onion down a bit.  I don't know how others are saying not to blend the dressing, if you do that you will have chunks of onion and probably a different flavor as well.  Overall a great dressing and recipe if you like onions!

I'm not usually a fan of salad dressing, but we loved the dressing that goes on this salad! Since the first time making this recipe, we have made a second batch of dressing to top salads that come with our pizza and other take out food!

This was salad is wonderful!! I made the recipe exactly as stated. I would not change a thing. I found real bacon bits that were already prepared so that cut down on the prep time. My 3 year old. Had alot of fun making the dressing. She ate the salad and the salmon that we ate it with. She even put the dressing over the salmon. She kept saying,  "mommy this is so tasty!!"

I used what I had on hand for the dressing - green onions and jalapeno-cilantro dipping oil - which gave the dressing some extra kick.

Soo good. My whole family loved it, and we're really not even salad people. I put it all in the blender so that I could get the full flavor of the onion. Also, I love sweet things but the sugar was a bit much. I'll defintiely decrease it a tad next time.

This salad was terrific! However, I forgot to add the sugar to the dressing and I'm so happy that I forgot. I think it would have been way too sweet with it.  Also, didn't have mushrooms so I added English cucumbers and tomatoes and used a Spanish Sweet Onion. I will 100% make this again!!! Everyone LOVED IT!

Excellent recipe!  The sweet dressing compliments the smoky bacon, eggs, and spinach soo well!  Unlike other reviewers, I feel that the dressing ought to be made in a blender or food processor as stated to achieve the proper consistency:  shaking in a bottle or jar doesn't puree the chopped onions into the dressing as the recipe obviously indicates should be done.  A better emulsification is also possible in the blender or food processor.  I used the small food processor attachment for my stick blender and made half a batch of dressing; it turned out beautifully! I added halved cherry tomatoes to this salad and made my own garlic croutons (from this site), and we made a supper of it.  Yummy!

We made this for our project on Bermuda at our International Day Fair and it was a hit!  Due to dietary restrictions I used vegetarian bacon and agave instead of sugar.  The recipe was delicious. I have never seen my kids so eager to eat more spinach! For that alone, I would give it more stars if I could. This is definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  When I first tasted the dressing, I thought the onion was a little over powering but once it was tossed with the salad it was much more balanced. I'll be making this again.

If I was served this salad at a restaurant I would go back just to have it again. It is way beyond delicious. We were licking our fingers. I made my own croutons and used slightly less onion which was finely chopped (I used a red onion). While I was grocery shopping today I noticed spinach on sale. I bought two bags and I'm looking forward to having it this week. Ingredients for both the salad and the dressing are perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Loved it.  Left out the mushrooms.  I will put a little less onion in next time but it was all gone by the end of dinner.  Yummy.

I halved the sugar and added a little bit of pepper and more celery seed to the dressing to suit my tastes. But if you prefer a really sweet dressing, make the recipe as is. I did use yellow onions. This salad would be great as a meal itself.

Easy peasy - and quite good.  I don't care for overly sweet dressing, so I cut most of the sugar and still got raves.

The salad itself needed more fixin's to go with the amount of spinach that was in the recipe.  Also I think we used too much onion as the onion flavor was very strong.  Will try it again and either reduce the amount of spinach or increase the amount of fixin's inside.

I thought this was a very good salad.  What I liked about it, was that everything was chopped in small pieces.  It made 2x more dressing than we needed, but, the dressing is so good--I'll use the leftover for other salads.  Because it made up more then we could eat in one sitting, I kept everthing chopped seperate & when I was ready to serve I just took what I needed.  The next night I added some sliced breaded chicken breasts & we had another meal.  Very Good!

Yum!  This was soooo good! My husband whined the whole way through watching me make it because he didn't like some of the ingredients, but he ate every last bit of it!  I used white vinegar b/c I didn't have apple cider and I forgot to pick up the mushrooms at the store, but it was still an unbelievable salad.  Definately try it!

I  loved this recipe.  I did cut back on sugar and onions. My family doesn't like boiled eggs in a salad so I didn't add the eggs but the dressing was delic!  I will make this again.

Fantastic!  I have a poppy seed dressing that has been a favorite and this is a great new variation of a sweet dressing.  I love the zip the celery seeds give it.  Since I'm vegetarian, I omitted the bacon and added chopped boiled eggs as well as raisins.  I love it!

Excellent Recipe!  I used 1/2 of a large onion (recipe calls for 1 onion chopped) which was plenty of onion flavor for us.  It is a good dressing for a traditional green salad.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really great.  I did cut the amount of onion down and next time will have to increase it a little bit.  Also used 1/2 cup sugar and thought that was better.  Great recipie to tweak to your personal tastes!

This is a very good salad, especially with this onion dressing.  I didn't have celery seed so I used garlic powder instead and everyone loved it. Next time I might use fresh garlic. I also added a chopped apple and some nuts to the salad...always looking for ways to add fruit and nuts into our diet.

Thanks so much Dee for this wonderful salad you so kindly submitted!  I made it tonight for my three college student kids and they loved it!  I did cut the oil in half and next time will cut the sugar to 1/2 c just due to our tastes.  I added tomatoes in place of mushrooms (didn't have) and added 1 c mozzarella cheese to help complete as a meal (filling).  "Can you say YUM! Yes I can!"  Great to have a new salad in rotation!

This was excellent. Everyone added their own salad dressing at the table. To cut down on the fat grams and calories I used  less bacon--(only 3 strips crumbled on 4 salads)--and less croutons and eggs (only 2 eggs). And you really don't need alot of salad dressing to flavor this superb dish.

This is without a doubt one of the best recipes I have ever tried for spinach salad. My children love it and, at best, they are very finicky when it comes to spinach. It makes a beautiful bowl when placed on a buffet table -- I tried it during the holidays and it was a raving success!

The dressing is fabulous.  I followed the suggestions and cut the sugar in half and used balsamic vinager and a red onion, shaking it instead of using the blender.  Definitely use less spinach and you will have extra dressing left as well.  Ty so much for sharing this delicious recipe!!

Good, but a lot of prepwork. Does not keep well. Adding dressing after serving would seem a better idea.

This recipe is so easy to make and people absolutely love it!  I recently had a party catered and the only item I made was this salad and the dish I got the most compliments on was this salad!  The dressing really makes it and it also does well on any salad!

This is delicious!  I added more mushrooms also.  I kept dressing seperate until ready to eat (it was a big batch for the 2 of us).

I will definitely make this to a potluck dinner.

This was really, really good.  My husband went nuts over the dressing.  I used red onion, which gave it a nice pinkish color.  I left the eggs out of the salad and we loved it!

The dressing was way too sweet. I omited all the sugar, my family really likes a tangy dressing we're not too big on sweet things. But without the sugar it made a awesome dressing.

I loved this salad..it has many of my favourite tastes, spinach, bacon, eggs.  My bf didn't much care for it..but I think it's just not his sort of flavour blend, and not because the salad wasn't good.  I liked the dressing as well, but cut the sugar down a bit.

I love the dressing and so do others! Two lbs spinach is a LOT; cut down on the sugar, and any sweet onion is great. (Can you even get Bermuda onions anymore?) When I don't want all of the fat, carbs, and protein in this recipe I use spinach with dressing and toppings on the side: dried cranberries,  fresh sliced mushrooms, and nuts or seeds. The onion and celery seed in the dressing give it so much great flavor you don't need all of the other ingredients unless you want it to be a meal!

I didn't want to get my blender greasy so I decided to create a hot bacon version of the dressing. I grated the onion into the hot bacon grease, with a very fine microplane, adding a bit of olive oil to get the right amount of fat, as well as the rest of the dressing ingredients and whisked it together, heat off. It was delicious.

This was a delicious salad. I would make some changes next time I make it, though. It needs more crunchy vegetables...celery, bean sprouts?
I used half the amounts of onion and sugar in the dressing, and it was excellent. I highly recommend it.

Actually, a question.  The first review questions the amount of spinach and it isn't mentioned in any of the other reviews...is 2 pounds the correct amount of spinach?

When cooking the bacon put it in the freezer for about 15 min. then pull off the amount of bacon you desire, slice the bacon in small peices before cooking rather than breaking it up after it is fryed. Also I use a smaller amount of sugar the reciepe calls for way too much sugar which is not really necessary.

Yummy salad. I eyeballed the dry ingredients because I just wanted a double portion salad for myself. The dressing was good. I made it as directed, but didn't have sugar so I substituted 4 individual packets of splenda. I'm not a big sweet eater, so I just added a packet, blended then tasted until I got the right ratio. Thanks for the recipe!

The whole family loved it!  I did lower the amount of sugar, and actually used Truvia instead.  Also used a purple onion, some in the dressing & some in the salad and olive oil cuz that's all I had.  Thank you!

My minor changes were using Bacobits instead of bacon (because it is faster), olive oil instead of veg. oil (because it tastes better) and no celery seed (didn't have it). I also added grape tomatoes.  For 2 of us I didn't measure the salad ingredients, but I did measure for the dressing, with a bit less sugar the dressing was great! We really enjoyed it and will make it again.

This is a keeper.  I did reduce the sugar to a 1/4 cup because I don't prefer a sweet dressing and even at that it was sweet enough for me.  I used red onion, and I threw some blue cheese in the salad,  Very yummy.  Might serve this for bunko.

Excellent salad! The amounts on the recipe are a bit off for my taste, I would cut down the sugar, a little less onion )and this is coming from an onion lover) and cilantro instead of celery. I don{t mean to change the recipe, just changes based on my own taste. But overall it was wonderfull

Very good. The dressing was a bit "oniony", but I think it was because I used a red onion. Didn't have celery seeds, so used caraway seeds and it came out fine.

Love love love this salad - cut back the oil and mixed the sugar with part sugar part splenda.  Omitted the croutons the second time I made a batch - didn't feel like they added much.  I left pretty much everthing seperate until the morning when I assembled it for my lunch and left teh dressing seperate until I actually was ready to eat it to avoid the soggy factor.  It was fabulous and I'm making it again for this week.

Left out the mushrooms and I think I'll play with the dressing a bit.  Only added a TB of sugar and it was still a little sweet.  Used Red Wine Vinegar but was still pretty tasty.  Loved the basics of the salad, my mom made it when I was a kid (wouldn't eat Spinach then!) but I love Spinach now!   Just have to play with the dressing.

Really enjoyed this! Simple to prepare and tasty. Left out the hardboiled eggs because I don't care for them and also used real bacon bits for a timesaver. Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit because I thought it was a bit too sweet but husband liked it just the way it was. Served with grilled beef tenderloin with black olives (see reviews). Went great with a Gaja red wine.

I made this salad for a BBQ this evening and it got RAVE reviews.  The dressing was so yummy!  The only chage I made was no crutons - simply because I did not have any.  Thanks for the great salad!

The Onion in this was so strong that I had to stop in the middle of serving it up and try to "fix" the dressing.  It even made my eyes water.  It would appear to me that the onion amount is way way too high.

Yum yum!!!  I made my own croutons cubing italian bread tossed in olive oil, garlic + onion powder, salt, pepper and parsley.  Broiled until golden brown.  I added a little more apple cidar vinegar to cut the sweet down a little.

I love this salad recipe!  And my husband does too!  The kids don't, but they don't like food that touches each other.  I halve the recipe and keep the dressing seperate until we eat it, which makes leftovers easy and just as delicious!

I made this salad for Easter dinner.  We all loved it.  My husband is asking for this salad again next Sunday.  I did cut the sugar in half and used Tarragon vinegar since I was out of cider vinegar.  It worked great.  LOVE this recipe.

Whoa...way to much onion in the dressing.  That was all we could taste the whole meal.  I will try it again using a couple tablespoons because the rest of the flavors seemed to balance well.  Only used half the sugar.  Liked the ingredients for the salad, definitely could serve to guests.

Hubby gives this one a 5 - I would say 4.  Very good, but the amounts seem a bit off.  I used 1/2 bag of spinach and changed the recipe to four servings for everything else. Could probably use more spinach and have a nice balance.  The dressing was fantastic, even with honey mustard instead of dijon and cutting the sugar by about 1/2.

This recipe is more for the dressing than the actual contents of the salad.  That said, the dressing is fantastic.  I used a third cup of sugar and that was still too sweet.  I would add sugar at the end, to your tasting.  The salad can interchange so many ingredients.  I added a little romaine for crunch, poached the eggs as another reviewer (saves ALOT of time!!), cherry tomatoes, walnuts and cheese.

Very good.  Needed a last minute dressing for a bag of baby spinach I had and this was perfect.  Used less sugar, as some others suggested, and balsamic vinegar (because we were out of cider vinegar).  Tasted wonderful.  Thanks.

The dressing alone deserves five stars. I am not a fan of bottled dressings, they're all blah. When my husband and I whipped this up, we added a bit more oil, poppyseeds and appr. a tablespoon of bacon drippings. Delightful! The salad was not bad also:-) Thanks for a great recipe.

I first had this at a friend’s house and enjoyed it so I am happy to find the recipe here! I only used 1/2 of a Vidalia onion. 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 olive oil. Lots of baby Bella mushrooms. It makes such an attractive salad!

I followed the recipe with a few healthy changes and used less spinach, even less than 1 lb.: I omitted croutons, replaced veg oil with extra virgin olive oil, and used just one packet of stevia in place of the sugar. It was delicious.

My mother makes this every year for Easter as it is a family favorite.  My son has begged her for years for the receipe for the dressing, and she would never give it to him (family secret you know, is what she would say).  Thank you for posting the receipe, as we are actually having this for dinner tomorrow and I will make him the dressing and hand him the receipe.

I'm not sure why this salad is so good, but for goodness sake, it's a winner! The simplicity of the salad and the vinaigrette can't be overstated. I made as written. I found the vinegars to be just a little overpowering. I plan to make it again and use 1/8 cup each of the apple cider and white vinegars and make up the final 1/4 cup vinegar with a slightly sweeter balsamic of some type.

Awesome salad!! Flavours combine perfectly with each other. Note to self... for dressing: a half batch is plenty. Eliminate the pepper, cut the sugar in half, double the dijon, substitute balsamic for cider vinegar, use 1/4 large sweet onion. Can use shredded chicken in place of, or in addition to, hard-boiled eggs.

I absolutely love this recipe.  When I was in law school, the law dorms used to make a recipe just like this.  I was so elated to find this recipe which matches it to a tee.  This is the recipe I make that is requested the most **.  I love Allrecipes.com, and love the new feature that lets me track how many times I made the recipe.  This salad is in my regular rotation; and its the salad for people who do not like salad ;).

It is very rare that I can make a dressing as listed...I always follow the directions and then tweak to our tastes.  But this one was perfect as is except that I cut the ingredients in half, used high quality olive oil and only 1/4 cup of sugar.  In half, this recipes filled an entire glass dressing bottle.  A tip for great salad dressing is to use very good olive oil.  When you are blending or processing, blend all of the ingredients until smooth and THEN add the olive oil last.  Drizzle the oil in, a little at a time as you blend.  My processor has a little hole at the top that is specially made for this step.  This emulsifies the ingredients and helps the dressing keep it's volume without the oil separating to the bottom.

Cut the recipe in half since only 3 of us were eating.  Followed directions except I did not have celery seed.  I also used a shallot onion.  I also did not put the onion in the blender, I instead cooked it in some of the bacon drippings and then warmed the dressing up in the sautéed onions.

Wow. This recipe is great. The dressing is awesome. I doubt they mean 2lbs spinach. I used a 9oz bag of baby spinach and just backed down the ingredients slightly. I kept the dressing on the side. Wife was really impressed with this one.

I left out the croutons and did not miss them.  This makes more than enough dressing for 2 salads if you use a bag of spinach 3-4 eggs and about 6 slices of bacon for each salad.  This was a better portion for an everyday family dinner.

This is one of the best salads I've made and I always get asked for the recipe.  I used it at a New Year's potluck, last Thanksgiving dinner, numerous barbques, and anyone inviting me over asks me to bring it.  If ever there was a five star recipe, this is it!

Wow, this was great! Reminded me of a combination of traditional spinach salad dressing and poppy seed. We really loved it and will make it often.

I used this recipe for an 8th grade cooking class.  The kids who tried it LOVED it, though it smells a little strongly, due to vinegar and eggs.  Nutritionally, this recipe has 35g of fat per serving, cut the oil!!!
