This was very simple to make and turned out well. I like the combination of orange and capers. Next time, though, I think I will add a little brown sugar to make the coating a little sweeter and not so tart.

I just made this for dinner tonight. While the chicken was cooking I was able to chop the parsley and grate the orange zest so prep was easy. I served it over rice. I asked my family what they would rate it and my brother the chef looks at me and goes "This is good. The chicken is actually tender. You always overcook chicken." Thanks, Davey. Anyway, everyone liked it but we all thought the sauce needed more balance, it was just too sweet. When I make this again I think I'll add some chicken stock to the orange juice. Also, some salt is needed.

Really excellent- 4*'s because I had to tweak. First, the recipe does need salt. I added about 1/2 tsp. to the flour and pepper mixture. Second, I added about 1 tsp. sugar to the orange mixture per other posters. It did add a nice sweetness to the tang of the capers. Because of this tweaking, it was fabulous- but without a little salt and sugar, I know it would be less than stellar.

This was so good! We thought the sauce was perfect, not too sweet or tart. It was great with rice. The only problem was that I didn't want to stop eating! :0)Thanks Heather!

This is one of our weeknight staples, we make it all the time. Tonight we had it with steamed asparagus. Yum!!! Do be sure to add salt to the flour mixture. I've recently discovered that I'm allergic to gluten, so I made it with rice flour and it was still great.

Cook time was perfect:  Very tender, and moist chicken.  Capers & zest add a nice touch of tartness to the orange.  Surprisingly tasty considering the lack of herb and spice ingredients.

Delicious.  Based on several reviews, I marinated the chichen in a white wine / OJ combo and I decreased the zest to 1 teaspoon.  The results were very tasty!  I've attached a photo which doesn't do the dish justice.  I will definitely make again and I will try for a better photo next time!

Excellent dish - made it just as stated and it was great.  Served it with Arborio rice and green beans - my husband wants to know when I will make it again!

I had some trouble getting the chicken cooked throughly without burning it. Taste was fantastic with refried beans and pico for a fresh Mexican twist.

Didn't know what capers or zest was but found out on the internet and tried this recipe. It turned out great and my girlfriend told me "this one is a keeper". Enough said.

This was a pretty good recipe, but in need of some improvements. I followed the recipe to a T, including the cooking time, using the juice of the oranges I zested, with a little Tropicana added since I didn't quite have enough. I thought the cooking time was a little long, and as another reviewer mentioned, it was difficult to keep the chicken from burning. My main criticism of the recipe is the amount of zest... do you really need a tablespoon? It gave the dish too much bitterness. If I make it again, I will cut it down to a teaspoon. Also, I would probably use brined chicken or marinate the chicken beforehand, in Mojo or some orange-based solution, as I feel it could have really used that orangey flavor throughout the whole breast. Thanks for an interesting recipe!

Although I loved this chicken recipe, I think the recipe is bit bland.  I also added sugar to the orange juice.  I also added one table spoons of Lavender and orange rind to the flour mix. This adds a slightly sweet taste to the chicken, but use sparingly.

Great!  Finally a recipe from this site that I actually liked.  Definitely will make this again--very well written recipe.  Serve with rice or pasta, broccoli, cauliflower, or asparagus and pino grigio--perfect!

This was excellent. I used less capers (about 1 tbls) because I wasn't sure the kids would go for them, but it was a hit. The sauce is delicious; perfect over rice. Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious and ssssoooo easy.  I used trader Joe's frozen chicken breast tenderloins.  I threw them in a large plastic bag with the flour and pepper then just cooked them a little longer.  My picky kids loved this combination.  They don't like strong tastes (bbq sauce, hot sauce, etc.) but this had a nice mild flavor!  Thanks for a nice, easy dinner recipe!

We all enjoyed this recipe.  I did find it necessary to add some sugar to the orange juice, as without it is was a bit sour and salty from the capers.  That was not a reflection on the recipe, just the type of juice I used.  I mention only so you keep that in mind that some sweetener, sugar, honey etc may be needed as your taste dictates.

Really easy and tasty recipe. I added a tiny bit of brown sugar for taste and a bit of cornflour to thicken the sauce and it worked a treat. Also beware, a LOW heat is required, otherwise the chicken might burn on the outside and not be cooked on the inside! (Sadly experienced first time round!)

I tried this dish this weekend and was very disappointed.  The sauce was not nearly as flavorful as I thought it would be.  I will keep looking for an orange chicken recipe with a richer glaze sauce.

I didn't have parsley, so i used cilantro.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added just a teaspoon of brown sugar.  I didn't have any orange  est either.. but everything else, I followed the recipe as written and I really liked it.  Very different from my norm!

The adults enjoyed this dish but the kids didn't care for the orange sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a little corn starch to thicken the sauce up.

I didnt care for this recipe.  I personally am not a fan of capers and the sauce did not turn out very appetizing.  Perhaps I did it wrong, but I didnt care for it.

Great combination of flavors.  Next time I will cook chicken in oil alone and add the butter after chicken is removed to keep it from burning. I had to clean pan before making sauce due to burned butter; but put fresh butter and oil back in pan, added OJ and reduced as directed then added the capers.  Husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed recipe as written and sauce is really runny. I used fresh squeezed oranges for my juice thinking it would be even better, more work than it was worth. Ok flavor, but not that impressed.

This was pretty good. I'm not sure if I followed the directions 100% correctly, but it turned out well. The capers were an odd flavor. It was great with rice.

Well, actually a 3.5.  Husband liked, too much citrus flavor for me.  May attempt again with a slight tweaking. Good mix of ingredients.

This turned out good. It does need a bit more flavor added to the sauce but otherwise really yummy! :)
