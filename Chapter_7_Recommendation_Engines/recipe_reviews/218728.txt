I just loved this rub.  I have to say that I did add salt.  I think that it enhances the flavor of the other ingredients.  My hubby loves sauce so I put BBQ sauce on his.  I ate mine with just the rub.  I gave mine a 5 star rating.  He gave his a 4 said that the herbs interfered with the BBQ sauce.  That bein said I think that this recipe is Da Bomb.  Love it and will continue to use it.  Thank you so much for posting.

This came out really good.  I used country ribs because that's what I had in the freezer and subbed oregano for thyme (never use thyme in my house).  Probably due to the cut of ribs, but cooking time was only about one hour.  Came out very tender and extremely flavorful.  This is certainly going into the rotation!

This turned out pretty good.  We added a little bbq sauce on the ribs after I took them out of the oven.

Good.  A little different than the usual, sweeter, kind of rib rub; very savory.

I loved it and made no changes.  I will say that I had 6lbs of pork ribs and I loaded them with the rub and still had some left over.  I'm putting in a bag to save for something else at a later date. Of coarse my daughter only gave it a 4 but only because she loves her BBQ sauce.  She did take a few bites before the sauce and agreed that they were great but just couldn't  give us her sauce(lol).  I just don't understand....Anyway I Will use this again!
