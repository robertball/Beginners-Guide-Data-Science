This recipe was so easy and delicious! I just tossed everything in a casserole dish and covered it with foil since I didn't have the cooking bags.  I also used regular black olives instead of the Kalamata olives since that was what I had on hand.  It tasted amazing and it was so easy.  This is my new favorite recipe.

this is really good! I didn't do the vacuum  seal thing, but i did cook in the oven with the foil (less cleaning!). I stuffed some of the feta and artichokes in the chicken and drizzled some greek salad dressing on top too, so good!!

I made this recipe without using the vaccum seal bags.  I just marinated the chicken for a couple of hours in a plastic bag.  I left the olives off my husbands portion and without the olives it lacked zip.  He missed out!   I would make this again!
