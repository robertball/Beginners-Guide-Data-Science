Good flavor and very moist, but the hens were undercooked at the recommended one hour.  It's more like one and a half hours.

I used Kahlua and add a 1/4 cup of apricot preserves to the sauce.  Came out great! Thanks to those that suggested baking for 90 minutes rather than 60.  Ours came out just right.  I think they would have been underdone in just 60 minutes.

My advice for cooking time is just to keep basting it every 10 minutes or so after that 2nd half hour, and when they are browned on top, check temperature with a meat thermometer. Get them to 165 Fahrenheit minimum, and you're done.   Thank you for your recipe! We did this for Thanksgiving-- fantastic! We thought we almost didn't even need side dishes with such a great tasting main course! Remember to only do a half hen per person if you have plenty of side dishes.

I downsized the recipe to one hen for my fianc√© and I. Not sure about it's weight, but even though we cooked it in the oven for one hour it wasn't completely cooked; I am going to blame this on my oven which is old and seems to cook unevenly. My half was nicely done while his wasn't; the breasts were a little dry. I omitted the grapes since they were optional anyway. Added extra lemon and orange juices to the glaze/sauce, which was delicious! Maybe next time I will add some clove or nutmeg for increased flavour and depth. Served this with rice (white rice, diced red/green/yellow peppers, onion and garlic powder, chicken stock, water and some of the glaze). This is my first time making and eating a Cornish hen, only downside about the fowl itself is that the small bones (rib area) were a little tedious to pick clean. A keeper though, that's for sure!

Used Starbucks Coffee liquere which proved to have a mello flavor.  The birds were extreamly moist.  I did stuff them with seedless grapes in addition to the lemon and orange slices.  The fruit had a bit of a chicken flavor so no one ate it.  But they loved everything else.  Highly Recomended

This review is for the sauce only as I made this with chicken tenderloins cooked in a skillet instead of cornish hens. I used coffee flavored brandy (not sure if it is similar to liquer...) anyway, at first, it smelled strange and I was worried, but I just kept at it and after it is done simmering, I poured it into the skillet where the chicken is almost done cooking. I thickened the sauce with tapioca starch and it turned out very well indeed! I accidentally used 1/2 cup orange juice, so I just topped it up with the brandy till it reached 3/4 cup of liquid.

I really wanted to like this, but I thought it had a strange taste to it.

My birds, I did 2, were done in about 1 hour 15 minutes. The sauce is delicious and would probably use it for grilled chicken as well. Easy to do as well. I did not use grapes.
