I only needed half the dressing that was called for. I also guess I was in a hurry and mixed the Italian dressing and mayo together and poured it all into the salad, but that was fine and probably easier than waiting to add mayonnaise right before serving. I let the salad marinate for about four hours before eating. I liked the combination of Italian dressing (I used my own homemade) and mayo together, I've never had a pasta salad that used both. I only had fresh shrimp so I just sauteed in butter with a bit of Old Bay, garlic and parsley, then let cool before adding to the salad. Of course I took the cook's advice and added in more veggies, bell peppers were a nice addition. I will probably make this one again and add in some black olives and cilantro next time.

This is just like my shrimp salad except for the italian dressing.  I tried this and it was good!  I don't think I added quite a full cup (going easy at first) but it definitely added an interesting zing to my old recipe.

This is the first time to make a cold dinner of any kind with shrimp. Without a doubt I will be making it again.

I don't like raw tomatoes, so I took out a serving for myself, before adding in the tomatoes, other than that it was worth making.

I used whole wheat pasta for this recipe and added a little black pepper and basil. It was delicious.

Less one star because I felt that it needed some mods. I added juice of 1 lemon black pepper and fresh basil. I also used less than half the suggested mayo. Overall, good start for a pasta salad recipe.

Really enjoyed this shrimp pasta salad.  I only used 1/3 cup Italian dressing and 1/3 cup mayo, and that was plenty.  I also added some diced bell pepper.  I had some fresh shrimp, so I sauteed them in a little olive oil with creole seasoning and squeezed a little lime juice on them.  Tasty!

I saut√©ed my shrimp in garlic and olive oil before adding to the salad. This was a good recipe,however I can't help but to think it would also be good with Tuna, rather than Shrimp. Or, you do without either,  and serve as a simple macaroni salad.

Great recipe to bring to a party!  I added a can of white cannellini beans for protein and no mayo.
