Love this Chef John! I always find myself out of Tartar sauce when I need it and now I can just make it!! I am from the Northwest but now live in San Francisco. In the Northwest we have this on everything, but down here when I ask for it from the servers and they look at me like I am nuts or a smashed anchovy.

I served this last night for dinner. Everyone loved it. I did not have cayenne pepper so added a couple of dashes of hot sauce. This is simple to make and oh so tasty. No more store bought for me!

Awesome recipe!  I am not a fan of sweet pickles, so I made mine with dill only.  A perfect sauce with seafood, of course, but as Chef John says, it is also great on sandwiches.  I enjoy it on a French roll with Roma tomatoes, shredded lettuce, Black Forest ham and Swiss cheese.  With that many countries represented, I guess you can call it an International Sandwich!

Chef John, your recipes are always culinary masterpieces! I made your remoulade tonight (to go with your salmon cakes tomorrow) and what amazing flavours! I've made many tartar sauces before, but they were always missing something or just didn't taste quite right...this is the only one I'll make from now on! I DID add a couple of teaspoons of fresh lemon juice, but even without it, I would still rate this recipe 5 stars! Although the video says you can use all dill pickles or all sweet pickles, I HIGHLY recommend using both! Please also don't skimp by using plain white vinegar as stated as an option in the video...use white wine vinegar!!! Fantastic recipe!!!

Made exactly as described. Easy but doesn't taste like it! Exceptionally good.

Thanks chef  John. I always made my own because I never liked store bought. This was so good that I will not be  making my old  version any more. Wife never liked capers before but this also changed her mind. Delicious.

Excellent!     Since I am more likely to have the ingredients on hand, than tartar sauce, so it is nice to be able to make it when needed.

love Chef John, he demonstrates all his videos wonderfully. I learn better ways of cooking watching his videos. Wish I could get more of them.

Delicious along with Chef John’s fresh salmon cake recipe.  The finishing touch for the salmon. I omitted the sour pickles (which admittedly I had never heard
of).  This recipe still was a refreshingly delicious meld of tart and mellow. Store bought tartar sauce doesn’t stand a chance next to this!

I did not have fresh parsley so I just used dried parsley. It turned out very good with the fresh salmon cake. Thanks!

Easy to prepare and foolproof.  Keeps for a day or two but not longer.  I tried to freeze some but was not pleased with the consistency later.  Great on salmon patties.

I love Chef John, and i know it is called "Version 2.0" but Remoulade basically means "Mustard & Curry", and being that it doesn't contain Curry, i wouldn't say this is a Remoulade at all!

Haven't tried making it, but i am sure it is tasty, i've recently been using more Paprika, and my favorite Herbs, does have Terragon included.

The classic:

Oil, Egg Yolk, bit of Salt, some Pepper, Pickle or Cucumber Salad, Sugar or healthy options like Stevia... You could easily add Chives or Terragon, lately i've been using the Terragon, it is really giving it a whole new level... 

Always remember, there are 2 types of Terragon, French and Russian, where the French one is way more Aromatic! Highly recommended!
