This was alright if you are looking to enhance the taste of pasta. The flavor is subtle to say the least. I doubt I'll make it again, but thanks anyway.

I let the pasta stand for an hour. The flavor has an Asian flair to it. This would be a good base for Asian noodle recipes.

I added portobello mushrooms and onions. This was a delicious main dish and a departure from the norm. A lighter alternative to Italian style spaghetti. I might try this with Rotini next time. That might pick up the flavors better.
