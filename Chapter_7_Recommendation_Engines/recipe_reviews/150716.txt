I have never made donuts before, and thought I'd try this one as I like flaxseed and sneaking it in things that my kids eat. They came out good. I'll have to try other recipes to see how it compares. It seemed not very stiff to make the shapes, and I didn't have the right kind of cutters, so I just dropped in spoonfuls. They were yummy. I also didn't have a thermometer to test the temp, but waited until it seemed hot. Not so bad for first time, I thought. I would make them again.

I made these with an electric mini doughnut griddle instead of frying, so that probably changes the taste.  Made this way, these donuts definitely tasted healthy, so I wouldn't recommend them to Krispy Kreme fans without heavy frosting. If you're looking for a less sweet doughnut, these work well after a roll in 1:3 cinnamon sugar.

PS. If you dont have flaxseed, just substitute it with a cup of flour.

These are delicious! I would never think of giving my two year old a donut unless there was something nutritious in them (he is terribly fussy and likes sweets). He is always asking for another one of these. I made a few alterations, I baked mine as cookies on a cookie sheet at 325 degrees for 12 minutes.

Flavor was okay on these, but I had to add a lot more flour to get them to any sort of rolling consistency. And that made them tough when they cooled. Recipe doesn't work in my opinion.

These were good as is, although I like a lot of glaze on my glazed donuts so next time will probably double the batch for that part.

These did not turn out at all. I followed the recipe exactly. They were tasteless and tough.

The onion was too intense for me.  I would leave it out or try something else.  If it wasn't for that I'd give it a higher rating.

I made these donuts yesterday and my family loved them!  The flax definitely lent to a great texture.  The dough was a bit sticky, so I found myself adding about half a cup of additional flour (total) as I rolled out the dough.  I sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on the tops to make them look "more professional" but is wasn't necessary for flavor.  They were delicious!  I will make them again - soon.

Very yummy! I had to add extra flour to get a consistency that could be rolled and cut. Making sure the oil is at the right temp is also very important. Really enjoyed this breakfast treat.
