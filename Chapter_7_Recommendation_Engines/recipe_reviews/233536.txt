Oh wow! Butterball doesn't mess around when it comes to recipes. I loved it! Would definately suggest you try it. The only change I would suggest is a mix of cheddars in place of the sharp cheddar and reduce the velveeta to 2 cups instead of 3, and using 2 jars of Alfredo sauce instead of all the velveeta. The velveeta really covered those great complex cheese flavors. The corkscrew pasta was a wonderful touch!

The sausage is amazing, however, we did not like the mac and cheese. It tasted like the kind we used to get in school!

We LOVED this! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made homemade alfredo, instead of using the jar (we like it better). This was rich, creamy and delicious! We really enjoyed the addition of the sausage too...served with some broccoli, this made the perfect weeknight meal! I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was really surprised by this recipe (cut it in half for our family size.) For me it was a quick fix while running behind tonight. Both the boys and my husband enjoyed it (he'd die if he knew Alfredo was in it!) Would like to try it again with homemade Alfredo and different cheeses. But for a once and awhile meal that doesn't take long, this will come in handy. Also really enjoyed the sausage itself!

Yum.  Couldn't bring myself to use processed cheese, so I used a combination of cream cheese and an Italian blend; still creamy but with a zing.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to the cheese/Alfredo mixture to counter any blandness with a hint of heat. I also added a sprinkling of Parmesan to the Panko/Butter mixture.

I changed this one quite a bit because I am not a fan of processed cheese.  For the cheese sauce, I omitted the onion and instead of using the velveeta cheese and jarred alfredo sauce, I made a roux with butter and flour, added 2% milk and then 12 oz. of smoked cheddar cheese along with some nutmeg and a dash of cayenne and salt and pepper. I mixed it with wagon wheel pasta and the sausage and topped as directed in the recipe.  Then baked as directed. It was delicious and we loved how the smoked cheddar complimented the smoked sausage flavor.

This dish is all about comfort. A little time consuming to put together but more then worth it. I will make this again just not very often. It was so creamy and cheesey and the sausage just added another layer of flavor to the mix.

I started with a lighter homemade white sauce, then added real cheese to the sauce we prefer to stay away from processed cheese. I finished the recipe using the Butterball Turkey Sausage and topped with the Panko but skipped the butter. It was a good comfort food meal.

This was really good. I made a lot of changes, but did use the Butterball Smoked Turkey Sausage, as I believe it is that part that really counts. I omitted the Alfredo and cheese product and made a roux and added in shredded cheddar. I then added in the pasta/sausage and proceeded as directed. This was a great lunch and my daughter and I chowed down and literally took comfort in this amazing meal. Thanks, Butterball!

The Butterball sausage in this dish is FANTASTIC. I think it needs about half the called for Velveeta (we found the flavor a little too strong), but otherwise this is really a great recipe - pure comfort food. I skipped the extra butter on top, it doesn't need it, and didn't use the full amount of called for Panko bread crumbs. The bread crumbs really do add a nice level of texture to the cheesy noodles. It would be great with a package of frozen broccoli mixed in as well. I found the full recipe made more than my 9x13 pan could hold, and had to use 2 baking pans to hold it all!

This went over really well! Definitely not for the dieter, but sometimes you just need a rich dish like this one.  I do love the idea of adding broccoli or other veggies!  The turkey sausage adds a wonderful flavor.

Sort of a lot of work. It was good, but not something I'd make again. I added broccoli to make it a complete one-dish meal. I wish there had been more sausage, and that the sausage itself had more flavor. The mac & cheese were good, though a little Too Cheesy-Creamy (if that's possible). The sausage, and even my broccoli, were too lost in the mac.

My boys loved this. I made it as written. Next time I would make a roux of butter, flour and milk instead of using the jarred alfredo sauce. We loved the ButterballÂ® Smoked Turkey Dinner Sausage... it added such great flavor to this mac & cheese. I would definitely use it again!

I made my own white sauce then proceeded with the recipe by adding cheese, etc.  I like that it is lower in fat with the turkey sausage.  My family liked it.
