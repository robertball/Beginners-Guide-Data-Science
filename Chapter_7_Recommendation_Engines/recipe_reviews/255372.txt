This seems like a really great base recipe. I'm making it now and know it will be good. I'm just shocked they don't note seasoning with salt and pepper as you go...

Really tasty  I subbed Greek yogurt for the heavy cream. worked great. Just tempered it first to avoid curdling.  The leftovers got very very thick so I think I may cut back on the flour a bit next time.  I didnt have the full amount of cheese and it was plenty cheesy ..
