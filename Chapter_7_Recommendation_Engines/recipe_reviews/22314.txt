I made two version of the refried beans:  One with black beans, and the other with pinto beans.  I enjoyed the pinto beans better,but both were delicious.  I added a few extra ingredients:   beef bullion cubs, cumin, and I reduced the amount of liquid smoke to 1/4 teaspoon.  A special note:  USE 1/2 CUP OF WATER.  A CUP OF WATER IS TOO TOO MUCH, AND IT MAKES THE BEANS WATERY.  This is defintely a keeper.

5 stars with these changes:  used 2 (15oz) cans pintos (drained & rinsed), added chili powder and cumin, used only 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and just a DASH of liquid smoke, mashed the whole thing in the pan. Quicker and VERY flavorful! Since I drained and rinsed the beans, I did need the water. Great with a few tweaks!

I've always wanted to make my own refried beans and being that I needed them for a recipe and didn't have the canned stuff in the house, this was the perfect opportunity. I too used pinto beans, omitted the salt, added more garlic, two cans of green chiles and only about a quarter tsp. of the smoke and a lot less water. For the reviewer who commented on the fact that this was not totally fat free; beans alone have a very small fat content. Most canned refried beans are made with lard, hence the reason that these would be considered fat free. Good eats Lisa and thanks!

I made these with pinto beans (Joan of Arc, which when I read the label it said fat = 0, so I'll believe that mine were fat free) but only because I didn't think that the kids would eat the black beans (I happen to LOVE black beans).  These turned out really good!  I cut the salt and the liquid smoke in 1/2.  Not one bit left, thanks Lisa, these are the best (to date) that I have ever made!

Bravo.  Excellent recipe.  I changed a bit because I had only kidney beans in the house.  I added beef broth instead of water and used a little less liquid smoke and salt than called for. I topped with just a touch of shredded cheese and EVERYBODY loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great starting recipe. I added a couple of pinches of cumin, a pinch of cayenne, more garlic and a little chili powder and made a quesadilla with salsa and cheese. Yum!

I liked it a lot. I ended up putting a lot of hot sauce in it and hot peppers...then rice to calm it down...and beans, corn and some other stuff. But, it was really good! Thank you! I'll make it sober one day and do it justice!

I thought this recipe was okay but I found the liquid smoke too overpowering. One thing that bothers me though... the name of this recipe. The beans have fat in them. :(

A teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper was WAY too much of both.  I wondered about it all after I put it in, but it was too late then.  It was so salty and peppery it was inedible.

A good start. I found the proportion of water-to-beans perfectly fine. However, this recipe definitely needs some tweaking to suit your spice preferences. Mine needed double the garlic as well as cumin, chili powder, and jalapeno. I always like a good bite of acid in my food, so I recommend a little splash of cider vinegar in addition to the dash of liquid smoke (I did not use the whole 1 tsp called for).

Unfortunately, I think the fat is what makes most refried beans so yummy.

I used pinto beans.  Drained only one can.  Sauteed onions (extra), garlic, a touch of cumin and a chicken bouillon cube together in olive oil until onions and garlic were tender, then added all the beans.  Mashed beans while cooking. I did not need to add salt, water or smoke flavoring.  By the way, if you're a routine garlic doubler like me, try to resist that impulse for this recipe; it doesn't taste quite right.  In fact, I think it tastes better with less than two garlic cloves.

I found that the liquid smoke made this dish taste synthetic.  I was able to eat it, but I didn't care for the too present taste of the liquid smoke, which I even added in gradually because of others' reviews.

A great idea to give the beans a hickory smoked flavor without using bacon fat, but I found the recipe too salty and too overpowering with the hickory smoked flavoring. I think I'll omit the salt and cut back on the liquid smoke or add another can of beans.

This recipe has potential, but I would need to give it major adjustments. I should have followed my instinct and not the recipe: too much water and too much pepper! I enjoy spicey food, but I would not use black pepper to give the kick--next time, use a fresh chile to get an authentic Mexican spiciness.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it several times now to go in burritos and I adore it.  Made exactly as instructed, but with a few pulses in the blender at the end.  The chunks don't work well for burritos in my opinion, but the flavor is unbeatable!  Thanks!

Cut the liquid smoke to half a teaspoon or less, and then it's fantastic! Served with Mexican Rice II, some taco meat, tortilla chips, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes. Yummm.

Definitely needed beef bouillon, I would substitute the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of bouillon broth next time I make this. Also added cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder and a bit of hot sauce. Excellent base recipe though!

Prior reviewers have all touched on the points I'll make, but here's my experience:

The recipe didn't say whether the canned beans should be drained, so I did drain them. Good thing, as the recipe for me turned out to be a bit watery. I cooked it for 2 extra minutes, and still let it stand for a couple of minutes to thicken up a little. thought this was way too salty (since the canned beans already had salt). I may omit the added salt entirely if I make this again. Also, I thought the liquid smoke flavor was way too strong, so I might cut that in half.This recipe has potential, I think, but it didn't work for me with the ingredient quantities as given.

This had way too much onion for me. I even sauteed the onion before hand and added an extra can of beans. As per other posts, I cut back on the liquid smoke, salt and pepper. A nice idea but I think the amounts on the ingredients are wrong. I'm wondering if it should be two 'cans' of beans instead of two 'cups'.

These were yummy and easy. I used pinto beans and eased up on the salt and pepper. I also did not use the liquid smoke.  The onions were a little strong, so I added another can of beans (half mashed). Next time I may saute the onions before or lower their amount.

These beans were wonderful - a big hit with all at a Mexican inspired birthday dinner.  They were just as good if not better reheated the next day.  I used two cans of kidney beans and kept all the other ingredients pretty much the same, but I can say that I added small amounts of liquid smoke as reviewers suggested to make sure the taste didn't get too strong.

Yum!  I love refried beans and am glad I found this recipe - much, much better 
then any canned refried beans.  I carmelized the oinions in a frying pan before 
adding them to the mixture.  This meant they were no longer fat free but they 
were still low in fat and tasted great!

This is very easy and tastes great. I did use pinto beans this time. That's what my kids are use to. Will try the black beans in the future. I also decreased the amount of liquid smoke used. That will vary with everyone's taste. Would recommend adding a little at a time, and taste as you go.

This was the absolute best recipe for refried beans that I have ever had.  My family loved it.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.  I will use it for years to come!

Much better than canned refried beans.  I think I went a little heavy on the black pepper-maybe a 1/2 teaspoon would have been enough.  Good and very easy.

These were much more interesting and tasty than the refried beans I get from a can, mix, or even restaurants.  Like others, I used pintos (1 can, drained), 1/2 cup of broth in place of water (following the advice of another recipe, used hot broth to make less starchy), only a dash of salt and pepper, and only a few drops liquid smoke.  Also some canned chilis.  Sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil (I know, this adds some additional fat), then mashed all the beans in the pot with a potato masher.  Could have done with less onion.  These would be good in burritos, I think.

Nothing extra special, but they were good.  I thought there was a little bit too much liquid smoke in it.  I think I would half the amount of liquid smoke next time.  I followed the recipe exactly.

We liked this, even though I didn't think it was anything like refried beans.  I halved the recipe, omitted the smoke flavoring (don't care for it) and didn't drain the beans.  It was soupy (next time I'll omit the water) but the flavor was good.  Will make again with a few changes.  Thanks!

As many people noted, there are some changes that need to be made on this recipe.  I used 2 15.5 oz cans of PINTO beans, and reduced the liquid smoke to 1/4 tsp.  The 5 stars I am obviously giving to the recipe with adjustments made.  It was way better than canned and easy to make.

There were a great change of pace from store-bought refried beans. I just made a few changes and they came out great! I used A1 Smoky Mesquite sauce instead of liquid smoke (didn't have any) and added some chili powder, sauteed the onions and garlic prior to adding the beans, and drained about half the liquid from the beans instead of adding water.

I made these for a Super Bowl Mexican Fiesta and this is what I received the most compliments on.  Everyone wanted to know how I made them.  They were really yummy.  I added extra garlic and I put all the beans in the food processor.  I only added a very small amount of water.  They were great.  Definitely will make again.

The main change I did here was to soften the onions before adding the beans to mash up-just a personal preference-and to add cumin and cilantro and more garlic as was suggested. Delicious!

I didn't have all the ingredients for this so I used ground onion and ground cumin instead of smoke flavoring and diced onion: still turned out great.  This is definitely a recipe you can play around with a bit.

These turned out very well, but this recipe is a bit flawed in my opinion (which I would have known prior to making it had I read the reviews...). From the start I cut the salt and liquid smoke down significantly because it just seemed like an awful lot of both. There was way too much liquid for 2 cups of beans, even after trying to cook it down. I added another can of beans (mashed about half) at that point. They were a bit bland so I added a little chili powder and cumin. Turned out *very* tasty. Will make again with modifications. Thanks :)

This is a great recipe, but as others have noted it
needs some help. I subbed pinto beans for the black
beans, and I think the 2 cups it calls for is a typo, it
should read 2 cans. Also, 1 tsp. liquid smoke is way
too much, a 1/4 tsp. is enough. I rinsed and drained
the beans, added 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. cumin
and 1/2 tsp. ancho chili pepper. I reserved 3/4 cup
of the beans, then coarsely chopped the rest with my
immersion blender. I added 1 cup vegetable broth,
along with the rest of the ingredients, then let it cook
down to a thick consistency. Tasted just like the real
thing without the calories and fat. With changes it's
a five star recipe and highly recommended!

I used pinto beans (drained and rinsed, really cuts the salt), since I don't have black beans, but I'll do the black beans next time. These are really easy, and they are way better than the canned. I didn't use any salt, pepper, or liquid smoke (none on hand). Also skipped the onions because of family preference. Added cumin because of all that. This is a recipe that's easy to adjust to your personal liking, which is great to me! I am going to add diced jalepeno next time for some kick.

These were great and easy to do.  I made them to use in bean & cheese burritos, using a combination of black and pinto beans.  However, way too much salt.  I used dry beans, which have no salt added, so I can't imagine what it would be like with the canned variety.  I will definitely use this recipe again, making that adjustment next time.

Cut the liquid smoke in half and it still overwhelmed. Might be ok with 1/4 tsp. Would be better if onions were sauteed before the beans were added so that they would be cooked more. Will probably not make this again.

Exactly what I was looking for. We had asada from the grill and tossed it onto tortillas with these beans and some home-made guacamole. They were just right for the purpose and healthier than the kind you buy at the store. I even left out the salt. I'll definitely make them again.

This was quite easy! I too used pinto beans in stead of the black beans. I sauteed an onion and garlic on low heat until translucent. I added the other ingredients including the cumin and mashed it up. I used it to fill a wrap with guacamole and shredded lettuce.

These were pretty good, but very salty! I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of water and 1 cup of extra beans. With that addition, these were good. I also cut the pepper down to 1/2 tsp. and I am glad I did, because there was plenty of heat in the finished product. Thanks for the recipe!

I scaled this recipe down somewhat as I used 1 can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed), 3/8 cup (6 TBS) water, 1 clove of garlic, 8 grinds of pepper, around 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp liquid smoke, and 1 TBS dried onion. I also added 3 shakes of cumin and two shakes of chili powder. It turned out excellent! My husband enjoyed it, and he's the refried bean-lover in the house. Thanks for sharing, Bromfield!

It was very easy to make however way to much liquid smoke, salt and pepper!!  At least for our taste.  My kids normally love refried beans and didn't like these.  SORRY :(

I used pinto beans and halved the recipe.  Also used cumin, beef bouillon, a bit of canned jalepeno pepper, and 1/2 the liquid smoke, as has been suggested.  It turned out great and tasted delicious!

Okay I have to admit I did not follow the recipe exactly so that may be why it did not turn out great. I started with 2 cans of beans, cut down on the water, used pre-minced "jar garlic", and did not use the liquid smoke. I tasted it and all I could taste was onion, so I added a whole other can of beans. I still had the same overwhelming onion taste, and like onions! I can't see how this could taste good at all with the amount of beans the recipe suggests.

Great recipe! Almost fool proof.  Added 1/3 cup water instead of 1/2.  Didn't use liquid smoke. Will make again.

SO good! Forget the canned stuff...this is the best! I also cut out the liquid smoke and cut down the salt, pepper and onion. I think i will cut out the onion altogether next time. I sprinkled in some crushed red pepper flakes. Yum!

As other reviewers noted, reduce liquid smoke to just a few drops... also decreased the salt and pepper too. These are great-- better than any 'canned' refried beans I've had!

i left out the onions because i used this in a fajita and the salsa already had onions in it. i also left out the liquid smoke. these were good beans, they went well with the salsa chicken burrito filling recipe that i used.

These beans were really great, but please decrease the amount of salt and pepper to half the amount. I did use pinto beans as others have and other than being too salty, this was a great recipe.

I love these!  I'm not a big fan of pinto beans, so using black beans for this recipe was inspired, IMHO!  I agree with other reviewers, though, that it calls for too much liquid smoke.  A couple of drops is plenty.
Try is paired with Chicken Enchiladas I and Mexican Rice recipes!

Not appealing to any of my senses, looked gross, tasted gross and smelled gross. Sorry for the negative rating, I really was looking forward to trying it. Guess that's what trial and error is all about!

I had never cooked with dried beans, so we ended up with more than enough refried beans for a few days.  I also melted some Velveta cheese with milk and added some fresh cilantro and fresh basil to the cheese mix.  It added a great topping for the bean burittos with sour cream to top as well.

Would try again. Was sceptical of the amount of salt and pepper for the amount of beans, used only 1/2 tsp of each and it was plenty, still almost too salty. Added a bit of cumin and left out the liquid smoke, my husband hates that stuff. I think they will be tasty with our carne adobado enchiladas.

I loved them.  For those who had issues with the amount of liquid, the way to make refried beans creamy without fat is to keep adding water letting it cook off and add more.  I cooked mine for about an hour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quite tasty, though I left out the salt. Instead of using water, I used the liquid from my beans-homemade, not canned. Thank you for the recipe.

After viewing the recipe I thought the salt, pepper and liquid smoke could be a bit much so I added those ingredients to taste. The refried black beans turned out great.

had no liquid smoke.  Used 1 tsp cumin and dash of chili powder.  1 tsp salt WAY TOO MUCH.  Very tasty though.  I wouldn't call this refried beans though....more like pasty black beans.

Delicious! I like my onions very well cooked, and so I sauted them in "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!" (I know-not fat-free), and then added the remaining ingredients as directed. I used chicken broth in place of water, added some cumin, and in the last few minutes of cooking added a handful of chopped cilantro. Great in burritoes!

One of my staple recipes.  So good, and I never use liquid smoke.  I use half a packed of oxo bouillon in the water as well.  You can use any kind of beans, and if you have a food processor it makes life easier than if mashing the beans.    Excellent with Refried Bean Enchiladas from Taste of Home on this site!  My family always wants that when I have them over.  Freezes well.

Great idea for a recipe, although the mashing takes some muscle. I would recommend adding a few more spices. Cumin, chili powder, and Adobo seasoning did the trick for me, but i didn't put in as much salt. It was GREAT in a bean burrito!

Great healthy recipe.  I had to use pinto beans (can't find black here in Nairobi) and don't forget to drain them.  I had to use less water, and cut out the liquid smoke (can't get here). I then used salt and pepper to taste.  These beans are great on burritos.

I rinsed the beans and cut out the salt entirely as per other reviews.  I still wasn't very impressed.  To me the smoke flavour didn't seem to belong.  My husband liked it however so I still gave it three stars.

Could be good with several alterations, but then it wouldn't be the same recipe. It was VERY salty and I even rinsed the beans off and cut the salt and smoke flavor in half. In the future I wouldn't use any salt or smoke flavoring, not use pepper (other seasonings would flavor it better), use a purple onion and saute before adding it to the beans.

I think this recipe has promise so I rated it with 4 stars.  I used one can of black beans slightly drained.  I decreased the salt and pepper as other reviewers suggested and still was surprised by how salty it was.  I added water like the recipe called for and it made it edible but too watery.  On the whole it had a good flavor and I will make this again with next to no salt in it.  I did add a pinch of cumin.  Good recipe after some adjusting.

I like this, but I never use liquid smoke.  What is the point?  You can use whatever types of beans you prefer, and it turns out well.

Good.  Next time I will use a little less water and onion; and I will saute the onion before adding to the beans.

I was cooking dinner tonight when I noticed at the last moment that I was out of refried beans!  I quickly logged in to all recipes and found this.  I used it with our chicken tacos and it was wonderful, even the kids loved it!  I did not add liquid smoke or onions and next time I will decrease the amount of pepper...use half a tsp.  Thanks

I thought the liquid smoke flavor was a little much - I dont really taste that flavor in any other refried beans I have had.  

Easy to make though

I thought this was way, way too runny.  It needs more beans.  Even with using many of the adjustments that fellow reviewers recommended, it just wasn't to my liking.

We did not care for the liquid smoke flavor.  I will make again and leave the liquid smoke out and add some green chili peppers.

I wondered why prep time was 10 minutes.  Usually, prep times are underestimated, but it was mashing the beans that took the longest.  The confusion on how much water to add to this recipe might be because the recipe doesn't specify whether or not you're supposed to drain the beans.  I didn't drain them and added zero water and they were still pretty runny.  I used pinto beans also.  I've never eaten refried beans made from anything else (here in New Mexico).  I agree that 1 tsp salt and liquid smoke are too much.  In particular, 1/4 tsp liquid smoke is plenty unless you really like the overpowering taste of it.  I liked this recipe a lot better than canned refried beans, but will adjust the seasonings more and maybe add a few others next time I make it.  My family did like it though.

Great recipe!! I was a little short on ingredients, so I subsituted a bit, but they still came out great! I used a chopped up chipotle pepper instead of the liquid smoke, and french's fried onions instead of the real.  That obviously makes it not fat-free, but it didn't matter to me, where I ate them with cheese :)

Thank you for a refried bean recipe than is not fattening! The beans were very delicious. They were a little on the hot side, so next time we will probably add less pepper.
