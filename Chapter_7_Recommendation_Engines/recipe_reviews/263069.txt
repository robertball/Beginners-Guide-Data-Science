This is a delicious salad that I would make again on a hot summer night. I've made some tweaks too: I've used a bag of Success Boil-in-a-bag multi-colored quinoa, swapped a regular cucumber for the seedless one, swapped black olives for Kalamata olives, and swapped grape tomatoes for cherry tomatoes.  I also reduced my red onions and used silvered almonds instead of toasted. I have enough for leftovers too.

I'll definitely make this recipe again - got great reviews from the group I served it to. I tweaked the recipe in little ways: added ~1/2 teaspoon sugar to soften the acidy lemon juice a bit. I also reduced red onion to a tablespoon, finely sliced and minced, to give more subtle flavor. I used 1/2 tsp. salt to quinoa water (remember to rinse quinoa before cooking) and added another 1/2 tsp when combining ingredients to pep up the vegetables.
