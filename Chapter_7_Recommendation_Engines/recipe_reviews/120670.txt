I donâ€™t have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast and then mixed it in with rest of the ingredients, minus a cup of flour.  I kneaded the additional flour needed by hand.  The bread was good, but I wish I had used bread flour for a heartier bread.

Made this during a snowstorm on a cold early Spring day. Nothing is more comforting than a warm loaf of homemade bread!  Great combination of oatmeal and pecan flavor.
