This was a great, light alternative to my usual creamy coleslaw.  After making it according to recipe directions, it was lacking something, so I added extra tomatoes, chopped green onion and about a tablespoon of garlic olive oil.  I served it with chicken satay and peanut sauce, and the flavors were terrific together.

This was very good! I'm on a diet and can't make cole slaw with a bucket of mayo & sour cream. I had the slaw mix and left over diced tomoatoes from the night before. I didn't have lime juice but added a few drops of lemon juice. It's very good!

We loved this recipe! I took previous reviewers advice and increased the tomatoes,and olive oil and added shrimp. I chose a broccoli cole slaw mix which gave a fresh flavor, it was a meal in itself.

This was very easy, and it was refreshing to have as a small side dish, but I don't think I would want more than a few bites at any one meal.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add some chopped celery.

Loved this! We were tired of traditional coleslaw, but I still had a bag of coleslaw mix to use up, so this was the perfect solution. The flavor was so light and refreshing. I'll make this again. Thank you! :)

Great light cole slaw, just a little to salty.  I used fresh cabbage rather than bagged mix so maybe I didn't use enough and that's why it turned out salty.  I've never cared for the traditional mayo based version.  I added extra tomatoes, a little olive oil, and minced garlic as recommended by another reviewer and it turned out great.  Next time I will cut the salt and pepper a little.

I was pleased with the results - it tasted like I thought it would... No surprises.  I didn't measure, I did everything by taste.  Better than creamy coleslaw!

This is awesome. I grew up eating lots of salads with plenty of lemon and lime; I absolutely hate mayo and the sweetness that goes with it in coleslaw. Thanks for the idea!

I hate giving bad reviews, however, I was sadly disappointed with this recipe. It was extremely tart. This should not be called "coleslaw." Perhaps if one would reduce the amount of lime it would be more palatable. Reminds me more of a side salad served in a Mexican restaraunt. Will not make this again.

Not bad at all.  
Really nice to see the lack of any sugar. Even the lime wasn't overpowering. 

will try a this again.  maybe with a hit of some chilli

Oh, kind of eye balled everything, was bit heavy of the tomatoes. lots of Fresh ground pepper and a hit if world class Fleur de Sel.

I wanted to make a healthy cole slaw with what was on hand, so I gave this a try. I had a bag of cole slaw mix and some fresh garden tomatoes. I didn't have lime juice, so I used lemon juice. I added about 2 TB of agave nectar since many reviewers said it was too tart. I let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes while I finished dinner. It was pretty good, and would make it again.

I LOVE THIS STUFF!! I have made it numerous times and it is always so good made as is. I am finding great new ways to enjoy it as well. It makes a great side to the Spicy Tuna Fish Cakes from AR; I enjoy it in grilled fish tacos; mixed with quinoa and served with chicken or fish; yum on a bison burger; throw it in some stir fry. It really is a very versatile dish. There is some in the fridge right now awaiting its next great food adventure!

8.25.16   This was a nice change from mayonnaise-based coleslaw, but I have to say it was just "OK."  No doubt, it's lighter and healthier for you, and it certainly is simple.

I was worried about it being too tart, so added extra tomatoes and dried cranberries. My guests loved it. For me, it tasted better the next day when I added a little fresh coriander.
