This was delicious!  The only thing I added was a little more salt.  I used this crust for a spinach quiche, prebaking the crust for 12 minutes before adding the filling.  This is a great crust recipe for non-dessert pies, because it's rich without being sweet.

My pot pie recipe called for baking at 350 degrees and this crust really needs to be baked 
at 400 degrees or more to be browned.  I used this as a TOP crust for a beef pot
pie so I couldn't pre-bake it like the instructions said.  It was also the first time 
I've made crust with my food processor so I am sure it will be better in future
iterations.  I will likely try this recipe again but use it for a BOTTOM crust or for a 
top crust only if the recipe calls for high heat 400-450. 

Even with my turning the temp up and down and up to get it to brown and my 
inexperience with making dough in a food processor, it turned out looking beautiful.
The texture however was limp, not flaky, but it tasted tender and buttery.  I am sure any
shortcoming in the result was due to the baker, not the recipe.  I do agree with the other 
reviewer -- this recipe needs a smidgeon more salt.

I give this 5 stars for the method!  This is really a standard short crust pastry but using the food processor really cuts down on time and you don't overwork the dough which makes pastry tough.  A couple of tips - I cut the butter into cubes and stick them in the freezer to really firm up.  Pulse the flour and salt together, add the chilled butter and pulse just enough to form pea sized crumbs. Use ice cold water and add it as you are pulsing the dough.  Be careful to not add too much water - test by taking a pinch of the dough and squeezing it together - it should not be sticky but just hold together.  Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat it together.  I then rolled it to fit the pie pan and placed it in the refrigerator.  I used this for chicken pot pie and I did not blind bake it.  I doubled the recipe - for a top and bottom crust, used an egg wash on the top crust and baked at 400.  The result was a nice, flakey tender pastry.

I have made many, many pie crusts from scratch including making and rolling as many as 75 in a row when working at a restaurant bakery. This is indeed a classic pastry recipe and it works beautifully! I made two crusts using a food processor and blind baked them. They are about to be filled with Lemon Meringue III. I can tell from handling to pastry and seeing them come from the oven that these will be wonderful crusts. Be sure not to overwork the dough and use water either from the fridge or use water with ice cubes strained out. Stop processing before it totally comes together. Turn it onto a lightly floured surface and fold together just a few times until it forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and put it into the freezer for 20-30 minutes. Then roll it out. If it shrinks at all as you roll it, put it back into the freezer immediately or before filling. This will prevent gluten from forming and will yield a tender, flaky crust. You can also freeze the crust tightly wrapped either before or after rolling it and forming the crust in the pan. Sorry, I already filled the crusts; I'll take a picture next time.

I too like the method in the food processor. Easy peasy. Just needed to double the salt if using unsalted butter. I used this for chocolate tarts and it was a nice, sturdy & tender crust. Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe this morning to make the 120 Calories Peach Pies from this site.  After allowing the dough to sit for 30 minutes after processing, I cut the  eight 4" circle crusts, put them into the fridge for 15 minutes, then filled the crusts and baked.  The crust was tender and tasty and oh-soooo-easy to make.

This was easy and quickly made.  Yes it's a bit fussy if you're  trying to make a pie that bakes at a different temperature, but it is worth the effort.  Thank you!

Firstly, I did love how easy this pastry was to use and how quick it was to make.  Unfortunately I didn't like the cooked texture of this, and even though I blind baked the pastry, the bottom of my pie was soggy.  I do like that this wasn't sweet, so it worked nicely with my super sweet apple pie.

This is the only crust recipe I use now.  So simple and it always turns out great!!!  I roll it for pie crusts and press it for tarts...like this tomato tart.  Just press crust in a tart pan and add roasted garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil and cheese.  Bake at 330 for 30 min or so! Add a fresh salad and a glass of wine for a delicious summer dinner!  It really is a wonderful crust.

I truly love this recipe and am now converted to make my own pie crusts and not use pre-made dough!  This method is almost as easy, less expensive and so much better!!! I make it using coconut oil instead of butter...wonderful!!

The proportions are spot on.  I have tried other short crusts and found them greasy.  As I always do, I replaced the water with vodka from the freezer and only needed 4 tbs.  I wish I had read the review advising doubling the salt with sweet butter.  I was using this crust for a quiche that bakes at 375 so I did blind bake it for about 15 minutes at 425 to avoid a soggy bottom. This turned out beautifully.
