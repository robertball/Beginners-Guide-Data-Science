Excellent moist cake - I used 1 cup apple sauce in place of vegetable oil to make it a "non-fat" cake.  Came out great!!

The best zucchini cake recipe! Although I made some adjustments, instead of 2cups of grated zucchini I increased it to three..for me it tastes better and more moist..Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe

No clue why this wasn't the prettiest loaf I've ever made. But this is some "D" good zucchini cake/bread.  I did add some dried cranberries, and that was a delicious and pretty addition.  But I think what I liked even more was that it wasn't overloaded with spices.  I really appreciated just the conservative two teaspoons of cinnamon.

I thought this cake was wonderful but it sure didn't make four loaves.  I would like a measurment of the zucchini not knowing what size the cook used.  It is great and I am making it again today.

I doubled the recipe as the ingredents and I had cookie dough. After I added 3/4 cup if water to it, It was more like cake batter. Baked great and tasted really good.

This was good with cream cheese frosting, but did not stand well on its own.

Easy recipe. I changed it up a bit. 1st. - instead of 2 cups of sugar I only added 1 cup.  2nd. - I added 1/2 of chocolate chips.  3rd. - I made the recipe into muffins. It made 36 servings. The calorie count will be a little different. My husband really liked them. Easy to freeze and grab one whenever I need a sweet little treat.
