Great recipe! I altered some of the ingredients as I didn't have everything required, but it was still ended up tasting great:
* didn't have the soup, so used milk;
* added a dash of chilli powder; &
* used broccoli instead of kale.
I also more than doubled the pasta required (must have bigger appetites than the author!).

March 23, 2008 - I have made this recipe several more times with all the ingredients to hand, except I cannot source Kale. Continued using broccoli instead - tastes fantastic. Thanks.

Simple and awesome! I bought organic Potato & leek soup, used dry white wine instead of sherry, spinach instead of kale, 1 onion, 2 cans tuna, knorr Vegetable bullion (whole cube) and jarred roasted red peppers (they're really pretty good), organic 100% semolina penne, We bumped up the mozzarella from 1/4 to 1/2 lb and used the whole milk version. It came out great!!! Will definitely make this again!!!

This recipe was amazing!  It has now become a new kale favorite.  We have an abundance of kale in our garden right now and we will be making this again for sure.  I followed the recipe closely and I found that the cooking times for the veggies were too long.  I used Campbells Gardennay's Leek and potato soup and some homemade veggie stock.  It turned out beautifully.  For the next time I might broil the dish for a few minutes to brown the cheese a bit. It might be good with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar or some parm.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This is very good. I used cream of asparagus soup in place of the leek soup and escarole in place of the kale. Very yummy. Will definately be making this again.

This was great! I have a bunch of kale that needed to be used up and this fit the bill perfectly. I did do a few substitutions: I omitted the sherry (the kale steamed itself just fine without any liquid added to the veggies); I didn't have potato leek soup, so I used a can of condensed cream of potato soup instead; I didn't have vegetable stock so I used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of whole milk. It turned out creamy and had lots of flavor. Thanks for the recipe! It sure beats Tuna Helper :)

i thought this was really great as an easy, fast weeknight meal. i doubled the tuna and kale (we love both) and subbed parmesan for the mozzarella. very good and very adaptable, especially in terms of making it healthy/lo-fat. thanks!

I really enjoyed the Kale.  Fould the flavour a little light.  Kids did not like it (Kale) but the adults did.  Would cook again but add a bit more cream soup and tuna.

Everyone liked it.  I made a few minor changes for what I had on hand (& to make it Gluten Free To make GF I first sprayed  glass 9 x 13 dish w/olive oil then put 12 oz Schaar GF penne pasta in the bottom UNCOOKED (GF pasta won’t stand much cooking).  I sautéed onion, celery, red bell pepper, garlic  together (still tender crisp), added salt, pepper, 1/4 C red wine (it's what I had open), 8 oz frozen chopped spinach, 1 sprig of fresh basil & 3 or 4 stems cilantro chopped and simmered on medium heat covered until the spinach was thawed abt 2 or 3 min.  Next, stirred in about 1/2 of a small steamed cauliflower left from the night before along with the salmon.  Spread the mixture evenly over the top of the uncooked pasta (in the casserole dish), poured 16 oz ‘Imagine’ brand Potato Leek soup on the top, next  1 ½  C chicken stock (extra b/c pasta wasn't cooked before hand), sprinkled top with a generous cup of Daia (nondairy) Cheddar Cheese followed by  1/3 Gluten Free bread crumbs.  I misread directions - preheated and baked at 350 instead of 375 needed 30 minutes instead of 25 for the pasta  to be cooked al dente, but then I put it in uncooked too.  All in all my kind of recipe, healthy, easy, one dish, and liked by all! I gave only 4 stars b/c I think it needs more than 8 oz pasta & 1 can of fish per 8 people.

Great recipe! This came out a bit bland for my taste the first time but the 2nd time I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added chili powder. DH loved it, usually hates tuna cass. I just sprinkled about 1 tsp on the top of the casserole and it gave it great flavour! Also, will use 2 cans soup next time as I like a bit more sauce.

I loved it.  Just finished off eating it tonight.  I found this recipe to be a great way to put kale into my diet.  Very tasty.  I tripled the garlic, doubled the creme soup (and changed to both mushroom and asparagus as potato leek wasn't available in my local market), and doubled the sherry (heck... a little wine is good, more is better!).  I found the mixtures of flavors to be terrific - the sherry added a great something in terms of taste.  I will make this again.  I think it is a "base" recipe you can adjust easily to suit the veggies you have on hand.

This was easy and good with a little pre-prep work.  I could not find the leek potato soup, so subbed with cream of mushroom(2 cans).  Cream of celery would have worked great as well.  I also used two 5oz cans of tuna as another reviewer suggested.  I used some red wine that I had available in place of the sherry.  You definitely should season to taste before adding cheese and breadcrumbs.  I cheated and used one big pot and put in all my veggies at the same time, when softened, added the liquids, then pasta.  Love the beautiful color with all the veggies.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I made a few changes based in my cupboards 
*Spaghetti instead of penne
*Chicken broth instead of vegetable 
*Corn flake crumbs with a flavouring of lemon herb seasoning instead of herbed bread crumbs 
*Tabasco (to your liking)  on top of cheese before bread crumb topping 
*mix of mozzarella and mostly white cheddar 
*arugula (fresh bunched)  instead of kale 

I look forward to making this again with kale as called for... But wouldn't change my other choices. 
Recipe could easily handle 2 cans of tuna 
For a particular flavour... Any 'cream of' soup could substitute well 

Bon appetit!

We loved this recipe! Really different spin on the bland tuna casserole. It tasted much lighter to us as well. I used spinach instead of kale and it was super yummy. Hubby was even excited about taking it for his lunch to work!

Very tasty - this is a lighter dish and I have cut the recipe in half before. Definitely add more tuna- it needs it.

Good variation to the often boring tuna casserole with more veggies. I felt using boxed or canned potato leek soup led to a runny and bland flavor so next time I will either use my own homemade soup recipe or make a roux in place of it.

I needed to use dairy and gluten free ingredients. Used Imagine brand soup and dish ended up a little too soupy, I suspect because of GF soup. Next time will not add any broth and it should be fine. Great taste!!

We enjoyed this recipe. In the past, I have used light tuna to make tuna casserole. However, just a note, white tuna made a huge difference! As another reviewer mentioned, I added 1/2 tsp of chili powder - nice flavour. The amounts of salt and pepper are not mentioned - I used 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. I did not have kale on hand, so, as suggested by another reviewer, I substituted broccoli. I also didn't have sherry on hand, so I used apple juice. No vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. I only had about half the potato leek soup, so I added milk for the remaining. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. These substitutions worked out well. My kids asked for second helpings!

This recipe was great! I had to substitute cream of potato soup for the potato leek soup because we do not have this readily available in our major grocery stores in Houston, Texas. Next time I will add 2 cans of tuna instead of just one. I love tuna casseroles and this was the best so far. My husband really enjoyed it too. It's a  new and creative spin on the old traditional recipe.  Will definitely make it again! Thanks so much for sharing.

I found this to be a pretty good dish...a little atypical w/o mushrooms, but interesting. It does need some extra spices to add some heat (garlic and/or onion powder, Cayenne pepper). I doubled the tuna. The dish remains moist and flavorful as leftovers. Skipped the breadcrumbs but otherwise followed the basic recipe. I will eat this dish again. Gave some to my 98 yo Dad for lunches. He liked it a lot. Barilla Plus pasta adds protein since the recipe is a little shy of desirable levels due to a pasta forward dish.

This casserole was delicious.  It really is a base for anything. I couldn't find potato leek soup so I used cream of asparagus.  I added mushrooms.  You could use chicken instead of tuna, you could add, broccoli, peas, asparagus or any other vegetable.  Any pasta would work too!  The flavor was very good. Will make this again!!

I followed this recipe exactly as follows only using brown rice pasta instead of regular white pasta. I also doubled  the amount of tuna as one 5 ounce can hardly seemed enough! It was just Blah! Not your typical  Tuna casserole.  It had so many other ingredients we never even tasted the tuna.  I will not be making this recipe again, as I think my family prefers a traditional tuna casserole

Made this wonderful recipe.  Used cream of mushroom soup,added dry mushrooms and used the hydration liquid as my broth.  The cheeses I used were cheddar and mozzarella.  Made my own breadcrumbs with olive and rosemary bread adding some dry Italian seasoning.  This was so good.  Give it a try and use what you have on hand.  It is great as a leftover heated in the microwave.  I needed to put this is a 3 quart size baking dish.

I did not make any changes but I will next time.  It was good but could be much better with some revisions like the addition of cream of celery soup and more tuna.

This is a really good base for a tuna casserole recipe. I made some changes based on the ingredients I have on hand. I used frozen chopped kale, fat free milk, ricotta cheese, white wine, chicken stock, a can of regular tuna and spicy tuna combined and roasted red peppers instead of the original ingredients. I don't usually make changes on the first try but I didn't want to go to the store and wanted to used whatever is in my pantry and freezer.

Delicious! Had to make changes according to what I had.  Used 12 oz pasta, 2 cans cream of celery soup (did not have celery), used about 1 1/2 cups cheese, used chicken broth in place of sherry and veg broth, used 10 oz pkg of chopped frozen spinach and two cans of tuna. Used everything else as listed.  Definitely a repeat!  Only two of us, but I think it will freeze well.

The spousal unit is allergic to tuna and doesn't like too much garlic, so I used chicken breast and just left the garlic out.  Yummy.
