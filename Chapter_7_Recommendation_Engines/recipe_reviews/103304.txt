I added some garlic to the mixture for more flavor, and did not use Holland House Sherry.  NEVER use a wine that you would not drink a glass of yourself.  You'd be surprised how much better the flavor will be.

This was a good recipe.  I would have to agree with the previous review, use a better brand of sherry.  I made this twice, the first time with the holland house brand, the second with a much better bottle, the second was 10 times better.  The molasses was not too strong for us at all.  I also added some fresh garlic to the marinade.  Overall, very good recipe.

Very juicy and flavorful -- as long as you like the taste of molasses!  Also works in the broiler.

Not too bad for a quick little marinade. I was expecting more of the molasses to come through. Overall it is fairly mild. If I were to do this again I would use a better quality sherry and garlic.

Very tasty and quick to put together - I ended up broiling the chops for 10 min. on each side.

Absolutely fantastic!  I did add a small crushed clove of garlic and let it marinate for a little over an hour as we got sidetracked.  The extra time worked out great.  Also, I used a better brand of sherry as that is what I keep in my home for cooking.  I cannot wait to prepare these chops for our foodie friends.  Kudos!

Edible, but flavor was just too odd . . .

Not bad, but needs longer to marinade.  I used brown sugar instead of molasses.  Also, I used Holland House because that is what I had, but I'll try the recipe again and try the recommendations on using a better brand.
