A big hit!!! I cut the cooking time way down by piercing the squash with a fork 5 times then microwaving it for 12 minutes. I let it cool while I prepared the rest and then scooped out the seeds and added the rest to the skillet. I also left the peel on the apple and added a little bit of sage along with the oregano. This is a fantastic recipe using seasonal ingredients. Yum!

This was excellent. My garden has an abundance of squash that was mislabeled as zucchini. I don't really care for squash. Found this recipe and I will definitely make again. My husband loved it too, though he thought you should rename it "Squashington."

I was really surprised by how good this turned out. I was a little leery. It just sounded kind of different. Things I did different: I chopped the apples and sauted them with the onions and garlic. I used one onion, 2 cloves garlic, no oregano (ran out last night) and some mrs dash. I toasted the almonds and put some brown sugar on them and used a fabulous white cheese on top called "Dubliner" that I got at Sams Club. Surprisingly DELISH!

I tried it without the sausage and used morningstar mealstarter.Reason my friend is a vegetarian and wanted to see if using this would work.All other ingredients were used.It was missing something maybe more seasoning or maybe the favor of the sausage.Next time will try the sausage for me.If anyone has an idea to make this a vegetarian meal please help me out.Thanks

loved this: easy and scrumptious.  I used dairy free cheese so it's a go-to for a quick dairy and gluten free dinner.

This was a wonderful recipe! I sub'd walnuts for the almonds and old cheddar for the Monterey Jack just because that is what I had on hand.  the flavours were even tastier as leftovers the next day.

My husband and daughter loved it - raved about it - but it wasn't my favourite. I would have liked it more if I'd broken up the sausage instead of slicing it. It was a texture thing.

My husband and ten year old LOVED it.  They both had seconds and then my daughter begged me to make it again.   I was surprised by how much they enjoyed it.  I posted it that morning on Facebook that I was going to make it for my family. I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I used sharp cheddar as I saw in another review that someone else did it and it was well received.  I didn't add extra oil on top of the apples.

My husband loved this. I thought it came out with a little too much oil. I think next time I will work on that, but I will make again. The apples and the sausage went well together.

We liked it! Made it healthier with Turkey sausage and low-fat cheese. I cooked the onions and garlic with the meat. Added some Italian seasoning since the sausage wasn't Italian sausage. Cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave for 12 minutes. Works great.

Lucky for me my landlord has a farm. I always have an abundance of summer squash and zucchini. I used summer squash instead and Chourico sausage! I also used walnuts as that is what I had on hand. Overall a great recipe. Chourico gave it an awesome flavour!

The decision is we'd make it again with our Minnesota apples. ;-)  I loved the oregano with the apples, squash, cheese.

So tasty, and especially good as leftovers!  We used colby jack cheese and chicken-apple sausage, and the flavors blended so well.
