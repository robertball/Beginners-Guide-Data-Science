Nice change up on stew.  After looking at the quantities I cut this down to 1/3 as there are just 2 of us and if it wasn't a hit, I didn't want to waste food.  I also didn't know if I had a pot large enough to hold all of it.  For our own preferences I used about equal amounts of carrots, potatoes and chicken.  My chipotle seemed very big so I minced half rather than the whole thing.  For us the spice was just right.  Near the end I was disappointed that the sauce was so thin, so I did mix a bit of the sauce with some cornstarch to make it a bit thicker.  This is a keeper.
