I made the mincemeat but added currants, dried cranberries and rum!  Reduced the number of raisins and apples to accommodate the increase in other ingredients.  Everyone loves it!

My husband's favorite holiday dessert is mince pie, so I thought I'd try to make him one. His reaction to this one? "It's crazy good!" Yes, that's a quote. I don't even like mince pie and I love this one. The only substitution I did was swapping nutmeg for the cloves, because I didn't have any on hand. It was delicious. It's a good thing I made two, because I'm taking the extra to Grandma's for Christmas.

I made this tonight for a family gathering and it was a big hit!  I used a premade deep dish pie shell (made it a little easier to prepare), and it still tastes great.  Served the pie with vanilla ice cream, and got lots of compliments!  Everyone liked the streusel topping too.

I used this recipe and put another crust layer on top instead of the crumble topping. I made earlier in the week and froze it and then baked it up the night of dinner. It looked very nice but does not slice very well

Made it per recipe except I used dried cranberries for 1/3 of the raisins and added a T. of Grand Marnier for extra flavor.  I used Splenda/brown blend for the streusel topping.  Next time I'd use less sugar in the fruit, as it was a bit too sweet, and add some nuts.  It's a lot of peeling and chopping, but really good pie.

I doubled the recipe and planned to follow it exactly. However, there seemed to be too much liquid (maybe because of the type of apple used). I removed about a cup of liquid after cooking the apples but before adding the sugar. I also added 2 heaping soup spoons of rice flour. The pies were wonderful!

We couldn't find a ready-made mince pie at any of the nearby grocery stores this year, so we decided to make one from scratch using this recipe. This turned out to be the best mince pie I've ever tasted! Even non-mince pie lovers said it was delicious. I made it with the following changes:

*I substituted candied orange peel for the grapefruit peel. 

*Instead of half a ground graham cracker, I added a whole ground graham cracker to the filling, because my filling needed thickening. The result was perfect thickness once it had cooled. 

*I substituted currants for 1/2 cup of the raisins.

*I used a graham cracker crust.

Those were the only changes I made. I used red delicious apples and made the filling the day before.  I kept the filling in the fridge, then the following day I put it in the pie shell and baked it. After baking, I just let the pie sit at room temp until serving the next day. It did fine at room temp. It sliced beautifully and held its shape. This pie was very easy to make, and it was absolutely delicious. We'll definitely never go back to the store bought or "from a jar" mince pies again.

I used a refrigerated crust and a little extra graham cracker on the top and this pie was AMAZING! I've never made a pie before, and this one was so easy and it came out wonderfully! Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it, even though most of us hadn't had Mince before. I will DEFINITELY make this again (and again!). The topping was the best pat!!

This was not like traditional Mince Pie.  It was more like an apple raisin pie.  It was good; just not mince.

This was my first foray into Mince Meat pie and I liked it. I made regular pie crust top, and worried it would make pie to watery, but it was perfect.

this pie is the best mince I've ever tasted. Or made.  I baked one for Thanksgiving and my brother had 3 pieces then took the rest of it home.  I will definitely be making it again.

My hubby asked for mince pie, wasn't familiar, tried this.  This is apple/plumped raisin pie with a streusel topping. The raisins are sooo plump!! A bit of a rum raisin taste, without rum. Quite yummy! It was kind of a lot of work, mostly dicing. 

Subbed 1/2 lemon,1/2 orange dried jarred peel so I didn't waste a dollar on a grapefruit peel. I used 1/2 granny, 1/2 red and added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Skip the granny smith all together, too bitter for this....go red apple.

Sooo...good pie, 2-3 hours work, if this is the kind of pie you're craving:)
