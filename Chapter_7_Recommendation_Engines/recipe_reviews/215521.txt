I make lots of pickles and this is a favorite among those who love cinnamon flavoring. I use very large cucumbers which I first peel and scrape seeds out of then cut up into sticks. They fit in the jar easier. I sometimes add a drop or two of cinnamon oil to the syrup for more cinnamon flavor. This recipe is often made with sliced cucumbers where seeds are cut from center to form a ring. These are known also as Wedding Ring Pickles. Most people are surprised they are made from cucumbers, they seem more like apples.

This is quite a process. Took me 4 days to get it done. And I did need to make more syrup to fill the jars at the end. 

I made a batch with the heart-shaped slices of patty pan squashes, they were so pretty.

The taste is wonderful at the time of canning. I can't wait until they've been in the pantry for a while to see how they are then.

OH MY GOODNESS!! These are wonderful! It is quite the process,   I'm going to have to make a double batch next year. I'm one of those mom that is totally against food coloring. My children reacted badly when they where little. I used beets when I cook the zucchini during the step of two hour cooking and only used less than half the food coloring called for. These are awesome!!

My Great Grandmother used to make something similar to this. Very excited to find this. And trust me if you have not tried this recipe yet.... it might take time to make but is well worth it.

Love them! I too omitted food coloring and they still a nice red from the red hots (I know-they have dye in them too).  I did about 4x the recipe using cucumbers (10) and got 14 pints.  A wonderful pickle to accompany any holiday dinner or family gathering.

Worth the effort! I doubled the recipe and got 7 half pints. I did have a lot of syrup left over, so I need to find a use for it. Perhaps make more!

Made this this week. First attempt EVER at canning anything. These turned out AMAZING! I'm so proud if my undomesticated self.  very simple step by step directions and they tasted exactly how I remembered my mom's tasting when she made them over 30 years ago. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I used the ground cinnamon equivalent.  DELICIOUS! thank you
