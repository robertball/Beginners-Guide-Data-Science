I made these and they are great for a house of sweet tooths. I had to up the cooking time to 30 minutes and the YOU HAVE TO LET THEM COOL FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR!! The inside was not doughy, but gooey with all the sugar and chocolate. I then cut them and let them sit overnight and they are solid this morning.

My grandmother used to make these as well. I found the recipe after she had passed away. Nobody else in the family has this! So every year I make them. I use pecans instead, and you are suppose to cook them for 30-45 min. depending on your oven. They are suppose to be a little moist in the middle. SO, many memories!!

My mom used to make these sans nuts all the time.  As an adult, I was silly enough to think she just pressed cookie dough in a pan instead of cookies.

This recipe IS CORRECT!!  The thing that some people might not have noticed, as I have done the very same thing on many a recipe, is the pan size.  That is a HUGE pan. 

14x 17 is not your normal size on a bar type recipe, so I think maybe that could trip you up.   My pan was 13 x 18 and the dough didn't quite reach all corners, but it cooked out beautifully.  

These do indeed cook in 10 minutes in a HUGE pan pan at 400 degrees.  The dough should seem like a thin layer, it will puff up while baking.  You will likely need to press it out as you fill your pan.  

They are absolutely divine!

I thought this was an ok recipe, however, my family and friends all loved it.  I baked them in 2- 8x8 pans and ended up cooking for about 30-40 min. (10 min is not long enough)  I added a whole bag of choc chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips.  I will be making again for my cookie baskets at Christmas time.

This either didn't cook right or just tastes bad!

These tasted really good, BUT - do they ever get cooked in the middle? I had them in the oven for ages, and the middle just collapsed when taken out of the pan as it was so soft. Would like to try the other Conga bars recipe to see if that is better.

They were very tasty and simple. The only significant change that I made was to use brown butter rather than oil. I added half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate chips along with coconut. I halved the recipe as well and used an 8x8 pan, baked for about 18 minutes. Really lovely rich flavour. My husband loved them! Thank you!

I did not have chocolate chips or walnuts on hand.  I added oatmeal for a little different texture.

I halved the recipe and baked for about 30 minutes. I also didn't use chocolate or nuts but added  tiny bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. They came out good and tasted great with strawberries.

I took the advice of others and cooked it overall a total of 40-50 minutes and it is still gooey in the middle and just a gooey chewey mess. Would not make this again.

Yummm!!  These were great - the whole family loved them.  I substituted the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips which resulted in a tasty, carmel-y flavour.  I also halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan.  Next time I'll probably use the original recipe proportions since they got eaten up so quickly.
