The flavor was what you would expect from a ham/bean soup, tasty, not spectacular, but predictable.  While the soup part was pretty darn easy to make, I had some problems with the dough.  It was super dry and I could barely pack it into a ball to rest.  The pinch and roll took a lot longer than I expected and my cherry pits graduated to olive pits and hey, there may have even been a peach pit or two at the end.  The dough balls didn't seem to add anything to the soup so I wouldn't even bother if there were a next time.

This was an AWESOME Soup.  I guessed on the parsley Sour Cream and Vinigar, since they don't appear in the ingrediants list.  I used 1/4 C Parsley, 1 Cup Cream and 1/8 C Vinegar.

The beans just soaked up the salt so it turned out a little bland for my tastes.  I'll make this again though and spice it up a little.

I made this soup, and it was delicious.  The  only problem I saw was that the recipe doesn't suggest how much parsley or what kind of vinegar to use so I guesstimated.

This soup turned out wonderful on a cold Sunday!!  I did not have any ham, so I used left over Turkey Breast and the one Turkey leg from the freezer. I also added some cumin and thyme to keep in line with the turkey seasoning. 

(Originally I gave it 4 stars, but my Husband demanded I give it 5)

This was great, filling and healthy. Thanks!!

Good Soup, but previously published by Taste of Home. Which gives the following for the sour cream/parsley/vinegar measurements:

1/2 cup sour cream, optional
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
2 teaspoons vinegar

I was looking for a white bean soup recipe and found this.  I reduced the celery to 3 stalks and increased the garlic to 2 cloves.  Threw in the hambone from Thanksgiving and a couple of pieces of crisp bacon crumbled with fat.  Yummy!  Everyone had to have seconds.  I didn't do the second half of the recipe as I was really just looking for a hearty soup recipe.  I will try it the next time.  Thanks for sharing.

kinda' bland until i doctored it up with my own seasons (little chili powder, garlic salt, white pepper, & some soup seasoning). like the others, i guessed on the amount for the sour cream & vinegar (go easy on the vinegar! it doesn't take much). over all, easy recipe to follow, just be prepared to add your own touches...it'll need it!
