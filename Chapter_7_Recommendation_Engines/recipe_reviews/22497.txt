Don't substitute potato flour for corn starch unless you want stange jeelly goo blobs.

It is easily sweet enough as it is.

I used a cinamonstick in the boiling apple juice as I had no powder. It worked ok.

Good recipe. Minimal ingredients and utensils required.

I tried frying the left overs and it didnt work out.

If you are using a big cup you could well do with a larger sized saucepan.

I hate to give bad reviews, but these were simply not edible.  I have never made dumpings before, but I followed the recipe to a t and they were very gummy, and not tasty at all.

My family loved it but I would recommend a little more cinnamon.It totally saved my life when at the last minute I had to make a extra dessert because my husband forgot to buy one on his way home from work because it's so fast to make.
