This is fantastic and SO easy.  Can be served hot or cold.  I also tossed on dried cranberries for more color and to complement the gorganzola.  SUPER recipe!!

Great recipe.  Had guests over and wanted something a little different for our veggie dish.  I didn't use any salt but added balsamic vinegar to the dish.  People were fighting over the last of the asparagus.  Thanks!

This was great! Used pecans instead (because I thought we had walnut but didn't) and it still was very good! Definitely recommend

What a classy mix of flavors.  I couldn't get enough.  Gorgonzola can be a bit overpowering, so I just lightly sprinkled it, as well as the walnuts, over the asparagus as a garnish.  I didn't even begin to use 1/2 c.

This is so delicious and easy.  I did exchange the gorgonzola with romano.  I made this as side dish to take to a friend.  It makes a great take along since it can be served room temperature.

Fantastic!  I had only one recipe that I really liked for asparagus, but this one actually topped that one!  Like the idea of dried cranberries, I'll try that next time.

Excellent taste - very nice flavour - we marinated in the olive oil and salt for 30 minutes.

Very good.  I used pecans and goat cheese because that is what I had. Will make this again and maybe even add to the holiday table!

WOW. So simple, but SO perfect. I toasted the walnuts in a dry skillet on the stove instead of in the oven so I could keep a closer eye on them, but other than that, made no changes. What an awesome side dish.

I made this for my husband and my roommate and they thought it was amazing.  My roommate doesn't even like walnuts!

Not the best recipe for asparagus I have ever had.  I think I will go back to the old recipes I have.

Really liked this recipe. Used feta instead of gorgonzola because that's what I had on hand. Very tasty.

I don't think I've gotten the trick to cooking asparagus yet.  It's not bad, but kind of bitter, and I think that's bc I overcooked it(?).  I don't know, but I will try again.  I'm determined to figure this out, bc I swear I've had asparagus before that I liked.  I had to sub feta and almonds, so I guess I was following more the recipe idea than anything else.  I liked it with almonds and feta, so I think I'd like the other just as well--as long as I like gorgonzola.  I can't remember at the moment!  Thanks for the recipe!
