This gets five stars for flavor, but only three stars for functionality. The ingredients are off. There isn’t enough sauce for the amount of tortellini. Double the sauce or halve the amount of tortellini. Also, I would switch the ratio of water to cream by adding 1/2 cup of cream to two tbsp pasta water.

The flavors are good but the proportion of the "sauce" ingredients aren't sufficient for the 9 oz of tortellini.  I had to make a roux on the side to which I added some milk & seasoning, then added it to the ingredients.  If I make this again, I'd stick to another recipe for a cheese sauce, though I definitely enjoyed the hint of tomato paste, which added complexity without making this a tomato based sauce!

I’ve made this twice as the recipe is written and both times delicious. It doesn’t take too many ingredients and it’s actually very quick on a weeknight. I’ve also put the sauce over squash and pine but ravioli. There’s no wrong answer

I made half the recipe to see if we would like it. I can say that despite making it to a T...this recipe was off in the proportions of ingredients. I had to add more cream and a bit more water and even had to cook a bit more pasta as 4.5 oz is not enough for two people. With that said, if you want to make this recipe adjust all the aforementioned ingredients and watch carefully as you cook the sauce to pasta ratio. You can always add a bit of more cream or water depending on the amount of sauce it comes down to and texture you want to achieve. The procedure and ingredients are excellent base recipe for a quick dinner pasta just adjust the proportions. I extrapolate that if I had made the full recipe, I would have end up doing the same adjustments.
