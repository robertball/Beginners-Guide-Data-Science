I was hoping these would be super stand out cherry flavored, but they were sort of more like a pink shortbread cookie. They were good, but not great.

I had RAVE reviews from friends and family when I made these cookies. However I also added a few white chocolate chips and added a small amount of the maraschino juice to ultra pink the cookies. We also didn't bother with the frosting and just chilled the dough in a bowl and scooped the dough into the pan.

@Sly the dough for this recipe is just a basic recipe I use for refrigerator cookies. If you use good quality ingredients the flavour is there. There is no need for a lot of salt. I usually use cultured butter, it has a bit more flavour than regular unsalted butter but is not always available. You can certainly use salted butter if you want. But the amount of sugar certainly makes up for the lack of salt. The dough is also more of a shortbread or pastry dough that's why there is no need for chemical leavening. Also if you dry the chopped cherries on paper towel before mixing into the dough your log should keep it's shape and easily be cut.  When you do make the dough take some photos if you can. Thanks for your concern. :)

sorry but these cookies were rather dull.  I had to add more flour, the cookies came out greasy and gummy.  not much flavor.  I'm also not so sure about using raw egg white for the icing.

The kids loved these cookies.  However, I wasn't as impressed with making them, and the flavour wasn't really worth all the effort.  I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla, which could be part of them not having a very bold flavour.  The dough was so soft that I couldn't roll it into a log, so I stuck it in the fridge overnight (almost 24 hours) and tried to roll them into a log again, still too soft and sticky, resulting in losing a lot of the dough to my hands.  But not one to waste ingredients I put some flour on some wax paper and rolled it that way and stuck it back in the fridge for a couple more hours.  When I went to cut it the dough was too soft resulting in me having to roll each slice and press back into shape.   The taste is good, just not a very strong cherry flavour, and that's okay the almond extract would've helped with that.  But the difficulty in making them made them lose a star, perhaps using them as a drop cookie would be better.

The cookies basically kept the shape of how I put them in the oven.  They never took a traditional cookie shape.  Although they tasted nice, they didnt look very nice.

I used two teaspoons of almond flavor in the dough, otherwise I followed the dough directions exactly. The flavor of these cookies really can't be judged until they are fully cooled. I was reluctant to use raw eggs in the frosting, so I made a simple powdered sugar and milk drizzle with artificial cherry flavoring. The cherry drizzle added a lot of flavor to the finished cookie.
