I made this last year and the family enjoyed it so much it was requested again.  I just popped a double batch into the oven...do ahead for tomorrow. I made it just as the recipe directs except I added about 1 tsp. Pumpkin pie spice (for double recipe) to liven it up bit more.  A taste prior to adding the topping told me it was awesome!!  BTW, a 13" x 9" baking dish was the perfect size for that double batch.

I am so grateful for the Allrecipes ingredient search function. I cleaned out my pantry last week and came across a jar of apple butter that was given to me several years ago. Not interested in baking, I wondered what I might do with it. Wow! What a great recipe. The only changes I made: 1) I used three pounds of sweet potatoes; 2) I left off the topping. It was great. Next time - and there will be a next time - I will try adding a little salt.

I used lactose free milk in place of heavy cream because of food allergies.  Everyone liked it and it's not excessively sweet.  Will make again.

I loved this recipe. I already have one that is here on Allrecipes that I always use. Yet, I wanted something a little different, so I tried this one because of the apple butter. That was it. I will always use apple butter from now on. However, I did omit the honey, as I cannot stand the taste of it. Try this recipe. You'll love it.

Used milk instead of cream.  Tasty, but a little on the sweet side.  Would definitely use less brown sugar in the topping if making again.

Made this in a pinch due to dropping the original potato recipe I had made . It must have been a Devine  intervention because my family loved this recipe and will have to definitely double it for Christmas.

I baked my sweet potatoes because I find them hard to peel. Once they're baked, you just peel the skin off. It's so easy! I also only used half the amount of brown sugar that the recipe called for. I do that with most of my baking. My family loved it!!
