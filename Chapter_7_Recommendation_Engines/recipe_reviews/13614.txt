I thought the directions were a little confusing:  'Add sweet potatoes, boiling water, and salt to a large saucepan' should read 'Add sweet potatoes and salt to boiling water.' 

My family does not like SWEET sweet potatoes, so I omitted the corn syrup in step 2, and used the juice of a whole orange instead.  In step 3, I drained the potatoes after cooking, without saving any liquid, since I did not need it.

I prepared the potatoes ahead of time and put them into a casserole with the orange juice sauce and pieces of oranges.  I also added 1/2 c. chopped pecans. I covered the dish and heated the dish in the oven (350) for about 1/2 hour instead of finishing on the stove-top.

I love anything orange and I love sweet potatoes, but this recipe was a disappointment. The potatoes do not take on the orange flavor (I even added more orange zest and some orange extract). And the corn syrup made a gooey stick to your teeth coating on the potatoes. Sorry....

This recipe was alright.  I wanted to try this because it sounded interesting and different!  I served these potatoes for Easter dinner.  No one really raved about them.  The comments were "What flavor is this?" because they couldn't figure it out and "They're good" but nothing spectacular.  I thought they lacked a lot of flavor.  I like my sweet potatoes really sweet!  This just didn't cut it.  I won't be making these again.

I made this for our Christmas dinner and got many compliments on it. The orange flavor was perfect - not too strong or weak, and it wasnâ€™t so overpoweringly sweet as the marshmallow recipes are - very fitting for someone trying to keep from gaining weight over the holidays.

These was different but we really liked them, it was packed with flavor. I think when I make these again I will roast the potatoes before making the sauce adding depth to the flavor. My only issue with this was by the time the sauce reduced my potatoes was starting to get mushy.

Since we had the oven going anyway, we baked the sweet potato s for an hour, then peeled and cut them into a skillet, and followed the recipe, substituting honey for the corn syrup. The orange flavor is pronounced,but this was a nice way to have sweet potatos.
