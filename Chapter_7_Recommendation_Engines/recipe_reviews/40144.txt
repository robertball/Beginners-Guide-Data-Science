My family loved this recipe. I used 4 cups of fresh peaches (which are easy to peel by dipping in boiling water for about 20 seconds and then dipping in cold water).  I substituted vanilla for almond extract.

I thought it was delicious and not too hard or long to make.  I already had all the ingredients at the house which made it easier too!  One note about the directions...in step 2, after mixing the sugar, lemon, etc.  Spread on top of peaches and put all in the oven while making the shortcake.

I wasn't too terribly impressed with this version of cobbler. Firstly, I felt it was to "eggy" tasting and secondly the juice from the peaches made it watery. I should have tossed the peaches with either flour or cornstarch before I placed them in the pan. As written, the topping seemed rather bland, so I added cinnamon for some extra flavor. Next time I'll leave out the egg and make more of a crumb topping and also use brown sugar along with the white. With a few adjustments this recipe has a lot of potential.

This Peach Cobbler really is good. I did not have Lemon Zest and Almond Extract. Instead, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tablespoon Vanilla to the dough. My family thought, it was sweet enough - and the taste of the Peaches was not hidden under Sweetness.

This was great!  The only thing I did differently was to add about a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the shortbread batter.  I would definitely make this again!

I recommend adding this to your repertoire of recipes for desserts using fresh peaches! I doubled the ingredients in order to bake the cobbler in a 9x13 pyrex dish. I used my food processor to quickly mix the biscuit crust. So easy, so yummy. Be sure to have vanilla ice cream or whipped cream as a topping. Your family will love it.

Best I've ever made! Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon instead of almond ext.for the filling. Added 1/2 tsp. baking soda, and used buttermilk instead of milk. The topping was very thick had to put it on in large crumbs and smooth it over lightly. then added the sugar. It was GREAT. Next time want to double the filling.

I used 4-5 cups peaches and only 2/3 c.sugar(1/3 c brown sugar;1/3 white) plus 1/2 t. vanilla. For topping sugar I added a sprinkling of nutmeg. This is very good warm with milk.

The filling was great. Tossed it with a little flour per previous suggestions. Also sprinkled extra sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon on topping but it just wasn't very good in general. Am trying to find some kind of streusel cobbler topping...none of the batter ones I've made have been very good. oh...used 8 fresh peaches and it made a big 9x13 pan..glad I didn't double the batter.

This is a great receipe. I did use 4 to 5 cups of peaches. As well as added 1/2 of the peach juice into the shortening so the bread had more of a peach taste. The juice came from the juice in the pan afer the sugar melted in the oven. This is delicious and i make it ever year for many occassions such as thanksgiving, christmas, new years, and mothers day. My aunt and uncle love it.

I agree with a previous reviewer, too much shortbread, not enough peaches.  Also, I found when mixing the shortbread it was way too stiff, so I mixed in more milk.  It was still way too stiff and the shortbread was dry and more biscuity than I like.

heating the fruit first really does make a big difference in the amount of liquid. I have made this twice and both times I didn't have a soupy mess.  Versatile recipe - I added a few berries I had, some fresh ginger and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. Yummy!

Pretty good.  I like the idea of heating up the peaches then putting the topping on.  Otherwise,  we liked this but didn't find it anything special.  The peaches you use make this dish.  We used beautiful yellow peaches we got at the farmer's market this weekend, and they are delicious.  I think I may have used more peaches than called for--we had peeled several peaches for another use and didn't end up needing them, so I went searching and found this recipe.  I definitely think it's worth doubling the peaches in this--like I said, the peaches make this dish so I'd suggest everyone go heavy on them.  I cut out some of hte sugar and topped  the batter with pumpkin pie spice instead of sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good but not great. You need to eat it when it's hot or it's just too mushy.

Terrific! The only thing to watch for is when adding the liquid be careful to not add too much, just add enough to moisten the dough. I then placed clumps of the dough all over the peaches until the whole thing was eventually covered.

GREAT DESSERT!!!  I served this for a dinner party in individual ramekins and my guests loved it.  I did not add the lemon and increased the almond extract to one teaspoon (personal preference) and it turned out absolutely delicious.  I did not find the crust to be too salty, it is only 1/2 teaspoon.

My husband bought a lug of Colorado peaches especially so he could have peach cobbler.  Putting the peaches in the oven while fixing the dough works well.
I used a slightly larger Pyrex dish to bake in and used a little over 4 cups of peaches, but kept the rest of the ingredients.
Instead of cutting the stortening into the dough, I grated (large hole side) 1/3 cup of frozen butter, which made it easier to mix. Also added a little nutmeg to the dough. Plenty of dough for the extra peaches. So easy and so good.

I think it would have been better if I hadn't used really ripe fruit, which caused there to be too much liquid.  Also, the crust was extremely salty.  I substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract and did not use lemon zest.  Not sure I would try this one again.

I thought this was ok but my son didn't care for it at all. The cake was more like a shortcake than cobbler. Also for my taste, it was way too sweet. Maybe my peaches were sweeter but I would cut back on the sugar if I tried it again. I tried it with vanilla ice cream, whipped topping and also with a little half and half poured over. The half and half worked the best as the ice cream and whipped topping just added to the sweetness.

I used frozen peaches from our crop last year and added a little cornstarch to thicken the juice.  The top is what we did not like; it like a dry piece of bread with little flavor and rough texture and there was more of it than peaches.  The lemon flavor was also too much.  I will not make this again.

I made this last night after going through every recipe on this site. I'm sure the reason it didn't come out was my error, but I won't be making again. It was way too juicy (I think I used way more fruit than it called for) and the topping was pretty bland. This was even after I added some brown sugar and vanilla in the batter..I would suggest mixing in some flour or corn starch with the fruit if your going to make this. It didn't hold very well.

I used less sugar in the peaches as they were local and really sweat. I also used the butter flavored Crisco and it gave the cobbler a nice buttery flavor. Definitely a keeper
