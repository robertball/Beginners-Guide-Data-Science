Wow.  This was great.  I used uncooked potatoes to hurry up the prep time and just cooked the casserole about 45-50 minutes to get the potatoes done.  Will use this recipe over and over.

WOW! What a terrific dish! I had ham leftover from the holidays and wanted to do something special. This recipe is easy and deee-licious! I tripled it and had enough for a 13"x9" and an 11"x7". 'Taste of Home' has NEVER let me down!

This was a tasty way to use up leftover ham. For a time saver I just threw in a can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of making the sauce from scratch, and  omitted the corn, adding diced carrots & onions instead.  I would definately make this again.

Boy was this good. A great use of the leftover Christmas honey ham. The rest of the ingredients I had in the house. Very tasty, creamy and a hit with the 5-year-old and hubby. Definitely worth a try.

Good.  Could use more substance, like maybe some additional veggie (broccoli, carrots, or peas).  Lots of prep time.

This recipe was very good and very filling! I added about 12 cooked strips of bacon and crumbled them in and also substituted the corn for mushrooms. I think next time I will add small pieces of brocolli and a little more bacon. Yummy!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make some changes - used mushroom soup instead of the milk mixture, used mushrooms instead of the corn. Added 1/2 cup red peppers, I microwaved the peppers and onion till tender.

Wonderful, tasty meal. Wasn't sure if I would like it before I tasted it, was very pleasantly surprised. Used can ham and substituted mushroom soup. Old and young loved this quick meal.

Flour cooked the first time, I changed it a little to make it easier for us non-experienced chefs....after browning the onion I took it off the heat for a minute - added a little milk to cool it down, then added the rest of the milk and put it back on the heat...careful with even that or the flour will clump...I also used frozen corn instead of canned - that was a mistake...then put it in a casserole dish instead of the 11 X 7...also a mistake - took twice as long to cook...however...

The flavor of this is very good - I added some garlic salt with the pepper...fresh garlic browned with the onion would be better.  My 4 year old ate this...therefore it ranks high with me!!!!

Very good!  My kids and I loved it, and my husband thought it was so-so.  I only put half the parsley in it, and that was perfect.  Made just the right amount for a family of four with left-overs for lunch later in the week!

This was tasty because of the cheese. Consistency was good, but we could taste way too much flour.

Yum!  I increased to about 1/2 cup onion and added about 1 1/2 cups slightly cooked broccoli. I also added 4 slices provolone cheese between 1st and 2nd layer (for a smoky creamy flavor). Reminds me of a cross between potato chowder and baked potato with cheddar and broccoli!

This turned out better than I thought it would. We really enjoyed it. It is something different to do with left over ham. Will make it again. Thanks.

I liked this more than my husband, but we both thought it was a four star recipe.  Yes, it is a little runny... I'm hoping it'll firm up for leftovers.  But it was surprisingly tasty (I made the sauce as written).

My husband and kids alike absolutely loved this recipe! There is a small hometown restaraunt here that we go to on scalloped potato and ham night, and this tasted just like it! Now we can have it at home! It was very very good! One tip: be sure you grease the dish like it says, I learned that the hard way.

This is a nice simple recipe to follow.  \i halved the ham content and added chicken.  I also added 2 leeks in the mix.  A very nice base that you can play around with to suit your taste.

First of all, I used some of the Baked Ham leftovers from Suzanne which is so, so, good.  This recipe is very easy and very addicting.  My family loved it and the 4 of us finished it in one setting which is VERY unusual for us.  I did make the following adjustments:  Used about 3/4 can of fat free milk, used 1 can of sliced potatoes, used one can of cream of potatoes soup, used 2 sm. cans of summer corn, and a little extra cheese.  YUMMY!!!!

My family loved this! I added a can of cream of celery soup PLUS 1 1/2 cans of milk which was  a bit too much. Next time I would still add the soup because it added wonderful flavor...but would cut back on the milk or add more thickener. I also added about 1/3 cups of onion because of the soup..needed more lift. My son was looking for more AFTER he ate my husbands portion!! (he was working and I had set his plate aside...) Next time will double this recipe and hopefully have leftovers!

I added a little garlic salt as suggested by another reviewer. My family loved it, would make again. A bit soupy for my taste.

Finally, another good use for leftover ham! I mixed about 2 oz. of cheese into the sauce for more flavor.  Then just sprinkled a handful of cheese on top near the end, using less than a cup total.
