These are hot and highly addictive . One thing I will say is that after the 30  minute mark you will need to start stirring every 5 minutes instead of 15. Once they start getting close they burn easily.

I made this around thanksgiving, I used the left over seeds from pumpkin carving (I do not recommend wasting time and energy separating out those seeds).  I ended up increasing the heat a bit and i didn't keep track of how long they cooked just keep an eye on 'em until they looked done stirring every 15 minutes as instructed. they cooked for well over an hour
