Yummy. Agree with "Buckwheat Queen" - 1/4 avocado was not enough. We also doubled the amount.

We also melted some left-over Brie and slathered it on the toast, after generously sprinkling with Balsamic, but beforehand layering the avocado.

Great and tasty way to use dinner-party leftovers!!!

I added some papitas soaked in truffle oil and arugula salad on top. It was absolutely delicious!  I got the idea from a local restaurant here that makes it this way.

In search of a low calorie way to snack on avocados I happened upon this recipes!! I was able to tweak it for my purposes! I measured 50g which is half of a small avocado and spread it on i/2 of a toasted Joseph's Pita. Sprinkled it with the rest of the listed ingredients...plus a little salt and it was both delicious and satisfying. Best of all, with all the spices, it was about 85 calories.

Both my mom and I loved this. My mom added canned salmon on top for added protein.

Yum! I used half an avocado, though I  admire anyone with the restraint to use 1/4 of 1. :-) I used red wine vinegar, since that's what I had on hand, and it was really delicious.

Pretty tasty. I used a whole avocado for two slices of bread. One-fourth per slice was not enough for me. Thank you for the recipe.
