OK, you had me at "French".  And "herbes de Provence".  Not to mention the tumeric.  I love split pea soup, and this did not disappoint.  I prepared as written with the exception of using two medium sized potatoes, peeled and diced, and about half of the carrots called for.  I added them in after the boil down to simmer, and just let it go for a hour and a half.  Delicious.  Perhaps not as "hearty" as the submitter intended, but excellent none the less!

My husband does not like split pea soup. So I left out the split peas. I also used the turkey broth that I made and froze from Thanksgiving. This was soooo yummy and hearty! Great with a crusty bread.   Husband, who normally doesn't like soup as a rule, are two bowls and then wanted it the next day for lunch! I don't give 5 stars without a reason.  I can just imagine what it is like WITH the spit peas!  mmmm

5 stars for the BEST Split Pea Soup I've ever had...much better than the usual sticky stand-up-your-spoon-in-it variety...and definitely not just for Winter! I'm sure great as written, but here's what I did differently: in place of the onion, sauteed a full container of Trader Joe's Mirepoix (celery/carrots/onion) for a looong time, until the onions caramelized (the 2T oil was ample); used half yellow & half green split peas (because that's what I had); finally, when adding the last of the potatoes & carrots (to an almost full pot with no room for any ham), added 2 tsp. Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp. coarse salt, & one 14.5 oz. can chicken broth. With some buttered rye bread, it was a perfect meal...can't wait for lunch tomorrow. Thanks, Jan :)

This was a really tasty pea soup.  I had a ham bone and some leftover slices to use up and I am really glad I found this recipe.  I did add extra veggies to it (celery) and used better than bullion chicken instead of vegetable broth (I didn't have any vegetable broth on hand).  It was very flavorful.  Best split pea soup I ever made!

This one is a winner!  The secret ingredient is really the turmeric.  I used to be the only person in my family who loved pea soup until this recipe came along.  It's definitely my favorite version, and the only one I make now.

I made this again...and I think it's a great go-to winter time soup.  I decided to add dumplings to it this time around. Thanks again for sharing your recipe!

A very nice  recipe.  Simple to make, flavorable and fills the house with wonderful aroma.
One comment on preparation; simmer time must be extended.   Turn it on, turn it down, take it slow.

Next time I make this soup, and I’ll definitly make it again, I think I will swap bacon, ham hock or smoked ham for the ham specified.  Cubed, boiled ham did nothing to enhance the soup’s flavor.

Authentic in taste. Flavours are quite lovely.
Added 1 extra carton of vegetable broth and used pickled pulled pork instead of ham.

Pretty good. I was looking for a good vegetarian soup recipe, and this is worth repeating. I really like the chunks of vegetables in it. The turmeric was a little overpowering, so I will decrease next time. If you're not adding ham, don't forget to add salt.

I really enjoyed this.  I used bacon instead of ham because that is what I had.

Outstanding recipe. Not the same old same old pea soup. The seasonings make this a wonderfully delicious soup.

I made this just as written.  The only thing we ended up tasting were the herbs. All the other flavors were lost.

This is a delicious soup - not your plain old pea soup.  The herbs make the soup, and it is truly wonderful!  I made this exactly by the recipe... but did not add the optional ham.  Hearty and perfect, summer or winter!

Nice recipe. I did like the Turmeric and Cayenne as part of the color and kick it needs to make it special. I also like the idea of keeping it "rustic" by keeping some of the carrots and other ingredients added later for some texture. I did add some pork for a bit more salt.
Will definitely make this one again. I will probably add a more substantial pork bone next time.

this was wonderful! i used curry powder in place of the turmeric and a no-salt blend in place of the herbes de provence, just due to what i had on hand in my pantry...it might seem like a lot of liquid, but the way the potato and peas break down into it thicken it so much that without the high liquid content, it would get too thick and scorch. have made it twice now and look forward to making it again!

The soup may not be the prettiest bella at the ball, but it was well worth the work. It did take longer to get the peas to soften but the overall flavor was really nice, DO add the ham...it adds soo much richness to the dish. And ignore the not soo appealing color from the turmeric....it's still good. And I had to use russet potatoes because my store was out of new potatoes but otherwise, didn't change a thing but would suggest adding a pinch of salt. Everyone in my house enjoyed it, and I mean everyone. Will make again.
