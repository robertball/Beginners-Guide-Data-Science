I thought these were good. Although I did find the dough a little hard to work with. Had these with jam and cream. Much the best way to eat scones. Thanks

I have to agree with the other review on one point: the dough was hard to handle.  That's because it was VERY dry and I kept having pieces fall off while kneading it that would just never stick.  I made it exactly as is (using the molasses option since I have no treacle).  This wasn't from over-mixing or over-cooking or anything - the dough was never "soft" and was just plain dry, as though there were too much flour.  Consequently they came out very heavy.  I've never thought of scones as being like one of our light & fluffy biscuits, but they aren't heavy like this either.  The *flavor* was good when fresh from the oven (with or without butter/jam), but after cooling off they were just like a big lump with no flavor at all.
