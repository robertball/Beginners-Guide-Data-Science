This recipe is really easy and quite tasty.  It was convenient to have the stuffing include a serving of vegetables.  I added more than the recommended amounts of carrots, celery, and onion.  I also used Bell's seasoning instead of the seperate seasonings.  After cooking the pork chops 5 min on each side, mine were still uncooked on the inside-so I sliced up the chops and cooked them through-still ymmy.  My husband ate it up.  Great recipe for a quick dinner!

The first time I made this according to the recipe, and it was very salty even though I used reduced sodium broth. Maybe it's the stuffing I use. The next time I made it, omitting the salt entirely, and it was great. I've made it with pork chops and turkey cutlets and both are very good. My favorite stuffing to use is cornbread. I use poultry seasoning in place of the thyme and sage, diced carrots, and frozen recipe blend (onions, celery, and red pepper). The stuffing alone is so delicious I wanted to double the amount but only had enough broth for three servings. Next time I'll plan better. We will definitely keep this in the meal rotation.

This was a huge hit with my entire family. I used cornbread stuffing (that's what I had) which was delicious. I also finely chopped the carrots as well as all of the other veggies with my vegetable chopper to ensure that I could sneak them all in on my unsuspecting children. Everyone loved this and it was very easy to make. I would definitely serve this again.

This was soooooo good.  Love the way the chops turned out and it was full of flavor.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauteed celery and onions.  I think I will try cornbread stuffing as another reviewer used and see how that turns out.  My family was looking for more.  Definately will cook again!!

This one's a keeper. I scaled it up to 4 servings to match what I had in the house and used Stovetop Turkey Stuffing. Took a little longer than expected, but that could be just me. Very flavorful though!

As is, it is a meal. I added a desert, and toasted french bread.  Enjoyed this and froze half for later.

soo fast and easy I just chopped the veggies while the pork chops were cooking and added a few min to the cooking time to be sure it was cooked through. I didn't have broth so i used 1/2 a bouillon cube and 1/2 cup of apple juice instead.

It was pretty good.  I tweaked it a little (used poultry seasoning and onion powder) instead of spices on pork. Also, I took the shortcut of using cornbread stuffing mix.  It's a quick, good recipe.  Thanks, Katie!

Great for a quick weeknight dinner. I didn't have the stuffing mix, so I follwed the recipe  up to this point and then added 1 cup of Minute rice and 1 cup of chicken broth instead.  Turned it off (just like cooking regular minute rice) and covered it. Served it as a side dish. Nifty!
