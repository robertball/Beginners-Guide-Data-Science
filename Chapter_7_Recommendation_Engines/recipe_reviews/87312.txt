This cake was very good and got several compliments.  I substituted more nectar instead of the brandy.  It was not as dense as a true pound cake, but that could be personal preference.  The icing was what I would consider a glaze, but it was good.  Over all, this cake was moist and tasty and I would make it again.

This will be my go to recipe to use in a pinch .Easy, very moist.
It is  very forgiving recipe. I did not have brandy so I did as one of the reader suggested, I used more of the nectar, also I did not have the correct size Bundt or tube pan so I put it in a 13x9 pan. In doing this way I did make a double amount of sauce to pour over.  The sauce was so delicious I could have eaten it by itself.
