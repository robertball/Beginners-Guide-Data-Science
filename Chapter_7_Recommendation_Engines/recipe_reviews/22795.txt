I washed the clams, and placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 until they opened up.  Then followed the recipe.  Next time I will omit the red pepper, because the filling was not bread crumby enough for me.

This is the proper way to make Clams Casino.  Even though there was extra hot bubbly butter spilling out, that's especially yummy [as a once in a while treat] to soak up with crunchy french or italian bread or bread sticks.  [I use more garlic, too.]

These were good and I agree with Julie's review that you can omit one whole pepper or use half a red and half a green pepper.  I also think the black pepper was a little much as well for my taste, I think you can cut it back to an 1/8th of a Teaspoon.  I was also a little worried about the bacon.  8 - 12 minutes, four inches from the broiler was problematic.  I moved the broiler pan lower twice.  I wanted the bread crumb mixture to brown nicely, unfortunately the bacon wanted to cook a lot faster.
