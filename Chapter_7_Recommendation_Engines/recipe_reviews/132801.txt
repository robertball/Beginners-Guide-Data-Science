Like many other reviewers, I added extra tortellini. In fact, I tripled it. I bought 2 19oz packages of frozen tortellini and used 1 1/2 of them. I used the same amounts of sauce, but rinsed the jars with a couple oz of water which I mixed in. I also baked the tortellini for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees F covered, then added the cheese on top and baked about 10 more minutes uncovered. This is a very tasty dish. Hubby thought there was too much "green stuff", but I really liked the spinach. It's all in your taste.

I am happy to be the first to rate this recipe.  It was really good. I mdae it for company the other day.  I served it with some procuitto wrapped asparagus and my guests thought I had worked on a gourmet meal all day.  They asked for the recipe and took home the leftovers.  This is a great one!

This recipe was not only delicious, but incredibly easy to make (hence the name, I suppose).  My only suggestion is to increase the amount of noodles used.  There is too much sauce for the small package of tortellini.  We solved this problem by dipping garlic bread in the sauce.  I bet it would also be great if you substituted the tortellini with penne noodles.

My family LOVED this recipe, BUT I am only giving 4 stars because it all depends on what brands/flavor sauces you use as to how well this turns out.   Our first time this was amazing! We used Prego Onion and Garlic sauce. The second time we used Ragu (can't remember what kind, something similar) and it was pretty salty and tasteless. Having made the recipe before we knew how great it was and will make it again. But if we hadn't made it previously with such awesome results, we never would have touched it again. That's what a big difference the sauce can make.  I recommend going for something more tomato'y, not sweet or cheesy. If you sample your sauce and it's too sweet, try mixing a little tomato paste into it.  Anyway, great recipe, IF you can pick the right kind of spaghetti sauce!

I completely agree with other reviewers that this recipe requires additional tortellini to keep it from being soupy. Since my husband and I are watching calories, I used a store-bought parmesan & mozzarella white sauce in place of the alfredo sauce. It tastes similar to the alfredo but cuts out about 40 calories per serving, and 5.5 grams of fat.

I just cannot suffer kitchen snobs! So what if the ingredients come out of jars/boxes/bags? It's all in how you put it together! This was fast, easy and more importantly, tastes good!

This is really good.  I plan to try it withe less cheese topping next time.  It didn't seem to add a lot to the flavor and adds lots of fat.

Easy, simple recipe for a quick easy meal that can be made ahead of time and popped into the oven for those time constrained.  10 ounces of spinach seemed like overkill, so I separated the spinach into quarters and added one quarter at a time until it looked about right, which equalized to about 5 ounces or 1/2 what the recipe stated.  Had Portabello mushroom sausages I had to use up, so I threw it into the mix which provided extra flavor. This isn't a "beautiful or pleasing to the eye" dish, but it does have a certain rustic element that is appealing to the taste buds.  Thank you Efasse for the submission.

I loved this recipe. I did make some variations.. I used Penne pasta instead of the tortellini. I didn't use as much pasta (about 8 ounces) because I sauted vegetables and made it a little healthier. I used 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 8 oz of fresh mushrooms, 1 small red onion, 3 cloves of finely minced garlic, 8 oz of fresh spinach and 1 small can of sliced black olives along with the italian seasoning and 1 bay leaf.  Put it all together in a cassarole dish...with the marinara sauce and alfredo sauce.... mixed 8 oz of parmasean cheese, 2 cups of moterey jack into the pasta... and topped it with 2 cups mozerella. Did'nt need a salad......and warmed up a loaf of focaccia. It was a feast!!!!

This was very good. I did what others suggested. I used 13 ounces of noodles, 18 ounces of marinara, and 13 ounces of alfredo sauce. There was still just a little left over for sopping the bread. I did not think the cheese was overwhelming as other users suggested but I do like cheese. It was awesome. Thanks so much poster

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I  followed the recipe exactly except I increased the amount of tortellini (based on the fact that others said it was too saucy).  There was still plenty of sauce for dipping bread in.  I also didn't broil the top, just stuck it in a hot oven until the cheese melted.  To cut some of the fat, I think next time I'll just skip the melted cheese on top.  It would be delicious with out.  I know some people mentioned they thought it was too spinachy.  I didn't find that to be true.  Served this with a green salad and foccacia.  A lovely meal!

My husband loved this dish.  I however, did not like it at all.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if I skipped the jar of alfredo sauce; either way, I won't be making this again

This is excellent!! I did use 20 oz of noodles rather than the smaller amount called for in the recipe. Otherwise there would be FAR too much sauce. It still makes a rather saucy dish, however it is great for dipping garlic bread in. Will definitely make again!!!

I just made this tonight using a 18 oz bag of Wal-Mart tortellini.  I put it all in an 11x8 dish and it was the perfect size.  I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes.  Perfect!  The sauce is a pink sauce which is commonly found in Italian restaurants.  (tomato sauce with heavy cream added)  That is what you get when you mix marinara and alfredo - a pink sauce.  It is rich and creamy.  This is a good base recipe which can easily handle added cooked ingredients such as chicken, sausage or shrimp.  Easy, delicious and satisfying!

Fabulous and easy. Based on experience, I didn't pre-cook the tortellini, and instead just mixed everything in one big pot, spread into the 9x13, and put it into the oven. I also didn't have spinach, so I instead used a bag of three pepper & onion mix I had in the freezer.

This recipe was so simple and delicious that I took a break before getting seconds to send a quick email with the recipe link to a few people. I usually don't buy or have alfredo, plus a total of two jars seemed like a lot of sauce, so I added about a cup of milk to the marinara to make it a little creamier.

It was ok, having said that the spinach was too much for most of my family, might have been better with finely chopped italian parsley and some green onion...i dont know. it was disappointing after so many good reviews to find it so ho-hum.

I got thumbs up on this dinner last night.  I used two types of fresh tortellini (cheese and Italian sausage).  Left out the spinach, but added sauteed mushrooms and crumbled sausage.  Served with garlic toast.  Everyone was happy!

SO GOOD!  I followed this recipe exactly, with the exceptions of adding extra tortellini and less spinach.  I didn't think there was too much sauce, it was perfect proportions after adding extra tortellini's.  I am a picky eater and this was GREAT.  Better than I expected!!

This was a hit, even with my picky kids, which I thought for sure would turn up their noses when they saw the spinach. They gobbled it up. I did add about 1/2 a cup of cottage cheese to the recipe, no real reason, just felt like it. Very good!!!

I'm testing out a few recipes, to find out which one I want to serve as a side dish for a pizza party. I'm so glad I tested out this recipe before the party because I would have been mortified if I served it to guests. This recipe was more like soup instead of a pasta bake and the flavor was extremely bland. What a waste of time and money.

Excellent - however I made some changes. I didn't have alfredo sauce, so I mixed a quart of my home-canned spaghetti sauce with about 6 oz of cream cheese, some Italian seasoning and fresh spinash since I didn't have canned. I reserved about 1.5 cups of the sauce and used a 20 oz bag of tortellini and that was about the right amount of sauce. I used about half the cheese as it called for and it was just fine. I will broil my baked pasta dishes from now on - it gave it such a nice crusty top!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added 1 chopped red onion, 1 chopped green pepper & 1 lb ground beef. Sauteed all of it then added the spinach, sauces & seasoning. Used Ragu Light Parmesan Alfredo sauce since it has less calories than normal Alfredo sauce. Also used whole wheat tortellini. Only used mozzarella on top, didn't add the Parmesan b/c I was too lazy to grate some, lol. Also, I accidentally dumped all the Italian seasoning in the sauce mixture. Put it all in a 13x9 pan for when I put it under the broiler. It was a delicious meal & I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent dish, we will definitely be making this again! It goes wonderfully with garlic toast, which you really do need with the amount of sauce this recipe creates.

A few changes and substitutions though. I cut back on the tortellini by about half, and added 1lb of lemon marinated chicken; then substituted the Alfredo sauce with an 8oz tub of Sundried Tomato Basil Philly Cooking Cream.

It was still a little sweeter than I like, so I added a can of oregano, basil diced tomatoes and  about 1Tbsp of fresh (from our garden) frozen chopped basil. Topped with only 1C/4oz of Mozzarella and baked at 350F for 30 min instead of broiling.

I did not like this recipe at all. The crust was awful and mixing the sauces did not taste good, it tasted cheap. Blah

Quick, easy and delicious!  I used a 16 oz. bag of tortellini, 10 oz. of spaghetti sauce, 14.5 oz. of diced Italian tomatoes and skipped the Italian seasoning.  Had to make in an 11x13 pan.  Just a great meal - thanks!

Easy to put together. A bit more than 2 cups of frozen tortellini was enough for 4 servings. Served this with a tomato basil bruschetta along with some Shiraz and it made a nice meal for two.

This was great!  We used half the amount of spinach, added cooked sausage and used a little less sauce.  We baked at 350 for 15 minutes, added cheese, then broiled for a couple more minutes.

I think it goes without saying that if you dont like an ingredient you simply omit it!  With that being said, my family LOVED this recipe!  I used about 3/4 of the box of spinach and it was just right.  I also didnt use as much mozzarella as called for, maybe only 2oz instead of 8oz.  And I sprinkled it on right before serving as well.  Dinner was out of the ordinary and delicious!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a wild success!  I, however, lack the patience to wait for my oven to reach broil so I used a temperature of 350 and let it cook/bake for about 10 minutes to let the cheese get melty and bubbly.

Don't cook the spinach to long in it or it takes to much like spinach.  Also, add more noodles because it calls for too much sauce.

Definitely not very healthy, but my dinner guests loved this meal, and the leftovers were fantastic too! I used more tortellini than recommended as other people had suggested, and I'm glad that I did.

Easy and good is a winning combination.  I left out the spinach - kids.  The spices are easy to adjust to whatever you have on hand.  And I used much less cheese.  Kids and husband all cleaned their plates.  I'll add this one to the regular recipe rotation.

Very good!!  I added a few things; a few chopped campari tomatoes, @1/4c minced onion, red pepper flakes, garlic and a dash of hot sauce (we like heat).  First time I used tortellini and the second time a box of penne pasta..both came out GREAT!  Thank you for the recipe!!

I was so excited for this but it was just kind of "there."  I spiced it up with crushed red pepper (about 1 teaspoon) and used two 13 ounce bags of tortellini which to me was just the right proportion of sauce to pasta.  Not sure if I will make it again.

This was so easy to make and delicious! There was a lot of sauce so I just didn't use it all and know to cut it in half next time. I made breadsticks with it and it was a great, satisfying dinner!

Almost too easy of a recipe for me, maybe a homemade marinara or diced tomatoes instead of the can sauce, next time.  Made exactly as stated and was told by my not so favorite friends of spinanch that it had to much!  However it did get eaten.  Not sure I would run to make it again, if in a jam for time a simple jar of sauce would work, opposed to having to purchase 2!

Just as the recipe says, it's EASY and delicious!  I added 1/4 lb of ground turkey and 1/4 lb sage sausage (because I happened to have them in the fridge). It was just enough add some heartiness and flavor. This is definitely on our regular lineup of dinners!  Highly recommend!!

Wow, this is really good. I used the full amount of tortellini and cut the sauce ingredients in half, and it made enough for dinner for two with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. The sauce was amazing. I used Prego Tomato, Onion and Garlic flavour. I love Prego because it has a sweet tomato taste, not salty. For the Alfredo sauce, I used President's Choice Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce. It has a nice smooth flavour and doesn't have that odd aftertaste that Classico Alfredo seems to have. I will be making this recipe very often. It is good enough to serve to guests, but easy enough to make on a weeknight.

This was good, I did leave out the spinach. I will make again, but will leave out the Italian seasoning also. And I like how you can change up the taste depending on what types of sauces you use.

Easy is definitely a great word for this recipe! I was impressed at how great it tasted. I loved the alfredo/marinara combination. I did add some extra seasoning, particularly garlic. We're crazy for garlic in this house!  Great recipe, I will definitely be making it again!

I doubled the amount of tortellini and I used light Alfredo sauce. I also left out the Parmesan cheese because I didn't have any. Instead of using the broiler, I put it in a preheated oven until the cheese melted. Absolutely delicious and so easy.

I've made this a few times, and I think it is great.  However, I think it is even better with al fresco sweet italian chicken sausage.  I sliced the links up and added them to the sauce.  Delicous!  
Disclosure:  I am a bzz agent, which means I got to try the al fresco product for free.

Made this today and used some of the previous reviewers suggestions.  I buy the large bags of Tortellin at Costco and break them down into 1 lb portions.  I used 1 lb of tortelli, a 16 oz jar of Alfredo and a 15 oz jarg of Prego and it turned out to be a perfect combination. My only problem was when I placed it under the broiler, the mozzarella and parmesan turned out with a hard crust which was hard to cut.  Next time I will bake it until the cheese melts.  Wonderful easy, delicious recipe which I plan to make often.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We aren't huge pasta fans, but the recipe looked good, and easy, so thought I'd try it. I followed the recipe exactly, using Newman's Own Fire Roasted Tomato and Garlic pasta sauce for the marinara and Bertolli's for the alfredo sauce. The end result was absolutely delicious - my husband ate half the pan!

This is delicious & my picky five yr old even liked it.  I added only 1 T. of the italian seasoning to the mixture because the extra teaspoon on top would have been too much & too strong a flavor for my taste.  I used half cheese tortellin & half sausage stuffed tortellini.  I'm going to add artichoke hearts next time.  My 8x8 pan is also not as deep as it needs to be for this recipe so I used an 8 x 11.5 glass casserole dish & it worked perfectly.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe for me. I used a 20 oz. pkg. of cheese tortellini,low fat alfredo sauce, and a jar of pasta sauce with Italian sausage, peppers, and onions because that is what I had on hand in the pantry.  Since I don't like the texture of frozen spinach, I used a 6 oz.package of fresh spinach. I divided the recipe between 2, 8 x 8 inch pans-one to bake and one to freeze (without the cheese) and bake later.  I also did not broil the tortellini.  Instead, I placed the uncovered casserole dish in a 350 degree oven and baked until the sauce started to bubble and the cheese turned golden brown. Each 8 x 8 inch pan serves 4.  This recipe is a  keeper!

matthew really loved this.   i used about 24 oz. of tortellini, half a jar of tomato sauce and 1 cup of homemade alfredo sauce, plus spices.  after mixing together, transferred to a 9x13 pan and sprinkled mozz on top and broiled.  left off the spinach because i knew no one would like it but larry.  it was a little too cheesy for me and larry.  next time maybe add some tomatoes and less mozz cheese and less alfredo sauce. but matthew and ally loved it .  12/12

Tried this recipe for dinner and absolutely loved it! My roommate and boyfriend were raving about how good it was! I used store bought garlic Alfredo and a spicy marinara. I also doubled the amount of tortellini. I bought a 24oz frozen bag. I would definitely make this again! Thank you so much!

Really good.  I did use more tortellini as suggested  (1 full 19 oz bag and 1/2 of another).  I couldn't tell from the posted recipe whether to use the dried italian seasoning (dressing packet) or the italian seasoning (spice), so I used the salad dressing.  I only used about 3/4 the package of spinach. Really good.

I thought this was gross.  The cheese needs to be cooked longer, and I love spinach, but the frozen spinach just tasted weird in this.

I give this 4 only because I don't use both types of sauces- I only used marinara.  This is a great base recipe to use fresh spinach & veggies sauteed up.  I chopped up red and green peppers and portabellas.  It's VERY easy.

So easy and tasty. I added some pre-cooked chicken nuggets which toned down the cheese quite a bit. My family thought adding in some broccoli next time would be tasty too.

Delicious--nice to serve as a vegetarian option and also is a terrific basic recipe to change around with different flavored sauces, different pastas, or meats added.  A new keeper for us!  Thanks for a yummy comfort food dish!!

We enjoyed this! I added a pound of hot turkey Italian sausage (casings removed, browned and crumbled) to the sauce mixture, and used 1 (20 oz) pkg, and 1 (9 oz) pkg of tortellini. Otherwise, made as directed, and it was really good!

Reviewed: Jul. 16, 2010  I loved this recipe. I did make some variations.. I used Penne pasta instead of the tortellini. I didn't use as much pasta (about 8 ounces) because I sauted vegetables and made it a little healthier. I used 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 8 oz of fresh mushrooms, 1 small red onion, 3 cloves of finely minced garlic, 8 oz of fresh spinach and 1 small can of sliced black olives along with the italian seasoning and 1 bay leaf. Put it all together in a cassarole dish...with the marinara sauce and alfredo sauce.... mixed 8 oz of parmasean cheese, 2 cups of moterey jack into the pasta... and topped it with 2 cups mozerella. Did'nt need a salad......and warmed up a loaf of focaccia. It was a feast!!!!

This was a really good recipe! I'm only giving it 4 stars because the amount of sauce to the amount of pasta was way off! I used almost 48 oz of fresh tortellini and it turned out great! I was a little hesitant to add the extra Italian seasoning but it added a really nice herb kick to the sauce. I used Bertoli sauces as these are my favs! Overall a great recipe and a different way to use tortellini that I will deffinately do again!

The picture shown with this recipe doesn't do this meal justice.  It's a very pretty presentation meal.  I too added 2 (19 oz) pkgs of tortellini with the same sauce ingredients indicated.  I also put this in a 9 x 13 pan and it filled it nicely.  One pkg. spinach is perfect for this.  This sauce is called Palamino sauce.  Served this with a salad and it was wonderful.  Even my spinach hating kids loved this.  Will make this again!

This was really good.  the amount of cheese on top is a little bit overkill.  looking at other reviews, I knew to use a little more pasta...I used 40 oz of tortellini, it was too much-- next time I'll use a little less, like about 30 oz..  but 18 oz pasta is not enough for the amount of sauce.  this is good but incredibly rich and very dense with the amount of pasta I used.

This turned out great and my whole family loved it!  I used about 29 oz total of tortellini, and I I estimated the cheese but probably used 1/2 c mozarella and a Tbs or two of parmesan.  I'll add this to the regular rotation!

Well this was just wonderful!  I had to substitute with what I had on hand, and I added some things too, but I think it would have been just as good if I had followed the recipe as written.  I used Penne instead of tortellini, and tossed in one diced chicken breast and some onion...also only had about 1/4 C spinach.  Used Classico brand alfredo and spinach cheese spaghetti sauce...this really was so incredible.  My kids ate more tonight than they have in weeks, so it's safe to say this is super kid-friendly.

Great recipe! The only thing I would change about this is to use a little less spinach- maybe only 6 oz. I froze the left overs and when we ate it later I found the spinach to over take the sauce.

Very good. Added less Spinach than called for in this recipe because my son hates spinach, but, he loved this and I'll be adding more next time. I was thinking Broccoli would be good in this. Chicken would be good too.

I was looking for a simple recipe for my college age son who is learning to cook. They're planning an Italian meal as soon as they get back to campus in August. Someone mentioned tortellini and this recipe fit the bill. Oh my gosh, this is delicious. It was very simple and quick to make and my husband said it was one of the best things I'd ever made. We all loved it and I will make again, and again. I did use a 20 oz. package of tortellini rather than the 9 oz. If you do this you need to use a larger pyrex dish-as the 8x8 one was super stuffed. Just delicious!

My boys LOVED this recipe and have asked for it more than once.  I do agree with other reviewers, though, it needs more pasta.  I have made it with italian sausage and without, and it doesn't add much to the meal so I'll skip it for the future to save on calories.  Thanks!

I thought that this was just okay.  My husband loved the mixture of the spagetti sauce and alfredo though.  He has some pretty back heart burn and this mixture was great for that.  I will make if for him if he wants it again but I won't push it.

I used a 19 oz. bag of tortellini and reduced the marinara sauce to about 18 oz. and didn't think there was too much sauce.  I ran out of Italian seasoning and used Creole seasoning and red pepper flakes instead.  I also added a shredded chicken bread, used only 4 oz. of mozzarella cheese on top (instead of 8 oz.) and melted the cheese in a warm oven.  I thought it was pretty good.

This is very good.  It taste like something you would order at a restaurant.  Make sure you watch your time when it is under the broiler.  I had it in for too long and burnt the top.  Luckily, I was able to save it.  I just scraped off the top, added more cheese and put it back under (for less time) and it was perfect.

I used parmesan instead of alfredo and added more pasta, and ground beef.  I left off the parmesan on top and added breadcrumbs.  I also baked until cheese melted and bubbly.  Very good!

After reading other reviews I halved the spinach and I used tetrazini pasta only because I don't like tortellini, and it was delicious.  Although I only used half the box of spinach it was the perfect amount for us.  I think using a different pasta worked better for me because my pasta wasn't swimming in sauce at all, it was a lasagna type of consistency.  The sauce tasted great!

This recipe had way too much spinach and way too much sauce. The tortellini were just floating around in the sauce. I wanted something more compact. I also didn't like the taste of the spaghetti sauce and alfredo sauce mixed. This recipe was very easy, but just didn't taste good.

THis is a great family recipe.  I am just learning to cook, and I found it easy to make and my family loved it.  I put in some frozen peas to sneak in some more veggies for my twins, and they loved it.  I will make it over and over again.

We thought this was great, although we ended up using a 12 oz bag of the Barilla tortellini since it was what we had on hand. We found that the proportion of sauce to pasta was perfect then.

This was good and easy. I'm not a bit fan of alfredo sauce, but I tried using most of the jar and I really liked it. The sauce turned out creamy, cheesy and tomato-y. Very nice. I added a bit of crushed red pepper and I will probably add more next time because it turned out a bit too sweet for me. Good overall.

I also added extra tortellini - all to the better, I believe. As a side note, one viable reason to review a recipe even if you’ve changed it is to validate the changes suggested by other reviewers, thus making the experience of future home cooks more likely to be positive. This is, after all, the primary purpose of the consumer review (distinct from formal criticism) process. I know many hate when people change a recipe and then review it, and I understand why, but there is at least one valid reason for it. Tangent aside, I will note that ALL 6 of my children ate this - and they agree on nothing. It is extremely kid-friendly and they still get some spinach in them! Bravo, I say.

I made a few quantity adjustments based on comments and my own instincts, but basically I made the recipe submitted. It was good. Interesting to combine marinara and alfredo sauces. That was a new twist.

Very good base recipe but needs some depth. I went with 29 oz of tortellini - Use high quality sauces (added a couple ounces of water) and good cheese. Use 2/3 the recommended amount of spinach; But add sautéed mushrooms, onion, garlic and bell pepper. Shake in a little bit of red pepper flakes and black pepper. So easy. Yummers!

This recipe is great!, quick and easy; however, I modified it some.  I added 2 chicken breast by cutting the meat into small cubes.   I added the Italian seasoning (less than 1/2 amount req'd br recipe), salt & black pepper to chicken, cooked in olive oil and skillet.  I also added 1/2 box of Barilla, Mostaccioli,  boil water and lightly salt before adding Mostaccioli.  Then I mixed the Marinia Sauce & Alfredo Sauce (Three Cheeses) and spinach and added it to the drained tortellini.  I let all of this come to a boil, stirring frequently to avoid sticking.  Then sprayed Olive oil into a 9x11 glass pan, spooned the mixture into the glass pan leaving room for other layers. Cover the mixture with a layer of Mozzarolla cheese and a layer of parmesan cheese repeat until pan is full.  Bake 350* for ~50 minutes.  The top layer of cheese will turn a nice golden brown.  I wish that I had taken a picture, but didn't know that I could add one.  Yummy!!  My family loved it and so did I.

I was a little unsure how this would taste but it was really good! I used hot italian sausage that I browned with onion and garlic.  I used about 3/4 lb fresh spinach (instead of frozen -- tastes better, not as overpowering as frozen), and 19 oz of cheese tortellini (cooked).  I mixed it all together with the sauces and 1 T. Italian seasoning spice mix in a large pan on medium heat until the sauces were blended and the fresh spinach was slightly wilted.   I put it in an 11x13 pan, sprinkled a little less than one cup of shredded Italian cheese blend on top (omitted the extra seasoning), baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and then broiled for about 3 minutes.  Served with garlic bread.  Very tasty.   With the sausage, 19 oz of tortellini and the fresh spinach, the sauce ratio was perfect.

I have made this recipe three times now, the first two times exactly per direction and the last time with the addition of one pound mild Italian sausage, one onion diced, and 4-5 garlic cloves minced. Outstanding, each and every time! I don't know where other reviewers are finding the "extra" sauce, but mine has had none. It comes out with a consistency similar to a well set lasagna, and not a soupy one. Will be making this for years to come! Thank you EFase!!!

I made this recipe for a big family gathering - and it was a big hit! I added a pound of sauteed italian sausage. It was so easy to make. It's one of those things that I love, because it looks hard and complicated, but easy!

This was pretty good, it seemed alittle wasteful for just my husband and I.  You could have split the amount of tortellini and had one night alfredo and the next night red sauce.

Very quick and easy - and I even made my own alfredo sauce, using the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce - from this site. This makes a very large pan of tortellini.  I think it would make 8 - 10 servings but I don't think it will last long!

Just made it tonight and it is perfect as is!  Add the amount of spinach you want other than that I think this recipe rocks in simplicity and easy seasoning to taste.  Btw I am one of those reviewers that cannot stand when the recipe is changed and then reviewed as this one is and also to the person that said this is not cooking-you stink

I didn't have marinara sauce on hand, and didn't have much alfredo sauce either, but I used what I had. I pretty much tweaked this recipe all the way around, but it turned out great! I used more tortellini, less sauce, lots of cheese, parmesean out of the can/bottle, a little less italian seasoning... and it turned out tasting awesome!

Simple & Good.  We left out the spinach.  I can't wait to try again and add italian sausage.  We did use more tortellini and used about 2/3 of each of the jars of sauce.  This would be fun to try with homeade sauces, but would negate the ease... and it is really good as is.

This was ok. I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated. Three of us liked it, 2 didn't. Thought it was just too creamy, I really didn't liked the alfredo sauce in it. Would have preferred some cream.

Pretty Darn Good! I used 2 jars of alfredo sauce, 1 marinara, 2 9oz bags of meat tortellini, a half pound of cooked italian sausage, extra spinach, and a small bag of noodles I had left over from a crock pot soup package. Poured it in a 9 x 12 pan, baked for 15 minutes, added cheese and put it back in the turned off oven for several more.  My son didn't even realize he was eating spinach until his next to last bite; declared it tasted too good to matter and cleaned his plate!  Thanks for the great recipe!

While this dish looks pretty coming out of the oven, it's not when you dig in.  The spinach is a big mistake! I should have known better and left it out with a 9yr old in the house!

With some changes, this turned out pretty good. As other reviewers have already said, you need to either increase the amount of tortellini or cut back on the alfredo and marinara. I made it with fresh spinach, and also added some finely-diced fresh onion and some red pepper flakes to the mix. We ate it with cheesy garlic bread and a leafy green salad. It wasn't anything amazing but it was definitely a quick and easy meal. Thanks!

Just made this for supper. Added 1 lb. hamburger, diced onion and extra pasta. My husband and boys loved it! It was so easy and so good. This would be great with any pasta. I will try penne next time.

Ok, three stars only to encourage the original poster to change the pasta amount, if you do then I will adjust my rating to five stars.  First, delicious.  I did use the 9oz of pasta but I had some left over polish sausage and cut that up and put it in there.  It wasnt overly soupy and it was good but I mixed some cheese in with it so that may have helped.    The parmesan on the top creates a delicious crust.  I would make this again and again.  Not really a company dish but kids love it.  (oh I didnt put the spinach in either)  One thought is that next time I will add little chunks of pepperoni.  (yeah make a fattier!)   The kids didnt like my recycled polish sausage :)

The recipe was really quick and delicious.  Great all around for a casual dinner.  I personally feel that it could use more tortellini and maybe sausage even, but otherwise it was great.  Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic and so easy I could not believe how great it tasted.
It needed a full 20 oz. of tortellini to adequately utilize the amount of sauce ( used 16 oz. of Alfredo and 24 oz. of marinara).
I added a small can (6oz.) of mushroom pieces, several shakes of red pepper flakes, and several generous shakes of garlic powder to sauce when simmering. 
I also used 4 oz. of **fresh** spinach, and didn't add it until 3 minutes before the sauce was done.
It made incredible leftovers and it didn't last three days before we had devoured it all!

This was good i did use fresh spinach, don't like frozen. And for the amount i was making 40 oz. of sauce would have been to much, so i bought ajar of sun dried tomatoe alfredo sauce. Worked great. Thanks. Also love the italian spice on this site Italian butter. so used that for the seasoning.

I did make a couple of variations, I used a 20oz. package of tortellini, ommitted the spinach, and used cheddar jack cheese in place of mozzarella (6oz). It was great! Everyone loved it! The next time I'll include the spinach.

This was delicious. I used a 19 oz. package of fresh tortellini and melted the cheese in oven instead of broiler. I thought 10 oz. of spinach was great. It's very rich and high in fat, so I won't be making it too often. I made it on New Year's Eve as a special treat for my family. They absolutely loved it.

If you don't like spinach, way are you making something with spinach as a main ingredient?  I find it interesting that some are reviewing this recipe as not great because of that.  I have made this three times and my wife and I have loved it every time. It is a winner.

This was awful, considering its high rating.  Easy? Yes.  Good? No.  I used less than half the spinach, and we ended up picking it out as we ate this.  The sauce was ok, nothing great.  I thought it sounded great, but plain marinara would have been better.  I will NOT be making this again.

This resipe is by far delicious and quick to prepare. It is kid friendly and adults love it too. I added more pasta and turkey sweer sausage. I also prepared some garlic cheese bread to eat with it.

This was a good meal - I agree with some previous reviewers who said there was too much spinach! I do enjoy spinach, but even when I used a 20 ounce package of refrigerated tortellini (which by the way is the perfect amount of pasta with all of the sauce) - the spinach seemed to overwhelm. Overall, an easy & flavorful meal that I will make again...with half the spinach!

I thought this could be a great dish, but the way it is written wasn't great for some of our likes and dislikes.  I used a 20 ounce package of tortellini, which was perfect with the amount of sauce.  But next time I will cut the spinach in half, as my kids wouldn't eat it because there was too much.  I love spinach and there seemed too much for even me.  I also didn't like the parmesan cheese on the top and would omit that the next time. It didn't seem to blend well, nor did it melt at all, so it made a weird crust on top.   I do think that putting in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes would be so good in this.  The dish reminded me of a dish I get when I dine at Olive Garden that has sun-dried tomatoes in it.  I think I'd give this recipe 5 stars with those few changes, which are mostly just personal preferences and not reflective of the recipe itself.  My husband thought this dish was "excellent" as is, but didn't care as much for the spinach and suggested less of it next time.  It is a very easy recipe, which I love!

I came across this recipe a little while back and decided to give it a whirl,  Well so glad I did my son who isn't much of a pasta eater absolutely loves this recipe & I do believe it's now up there with one of his favorite meals!!! That being said the only thing I add to this when I make it is bulk Italian sausage, I slice it in rings fry it up & mix it in & for a change up once in a while instead of using just regular alfredo I usually use garlic alfredo & it's perfect.

i used a 16 oz bag of tortellini and that was spot on.  I didn't find it too soupy.  I hate dry anything.   I didn't place in broil just by choice so heated it in the oven.  The sauce is what makes it imo, so if you're not a fan of spinach, add what you like.  I'm not a fan of tortellini so i might combine spinach and ricotta then stuff shells and cover with sauce.

This was delicious and even met the approval of my six and seven year old.  For meat eaters like my husband you could add sausage or ground beef but it isn’t necessary.  Great dish for those busy weeknights.

I made no changes this first time. It was deliscious. I did have a 20 oz bag of tortellini, not 18 oz. It filled about a 7 1/2 x 14" casserole.  Fast and easy. On the table in less than 15 minutes. Next time, and hereafter, I would cook some  sweet turkey Italian sausage, then dump the sauces, etc. In the pan, and follow the rest of the recipe. We are having leftovers day after tomorrow. Will get it in the rotation.

I used meat tortellini instead since my husband is always looking for more protein- it came out great- One tip : make sure your sauce & tortellini is piping hot when you put it into the oven to broil it because its only in the oven for 2 minutes. This was a bit hit!

I added in extra red sauce because I had it in the fridge. I used about 1/2 of a huge bag of tortellini from Sams club which is about 2 pounds (32oz). I made my own Italian seasoning and added a lot more than 1 TBS. I also added fresh Basil and Parsley from my garden. I added about 2 tsp of garlic powder because we love garlic.   I buttered a 13 x 9 inch glass pan and I never even cooked the frozen pasta. It first was heated up when I added the sauce and then it sat on the counter for about 30 minutes, marinating and thawing.

I used a 700g pkg of tortellini, and found there was still too much sauce. Changed the frozen to a 143g  pkg of baby spinach. As well, found the Italian seasoning on top to be a bit gritty tasting. That said, it was still good, and very simple to make.

Very tasty recipe!  I prepared it as detailed in the post and it was a hit with everybody.  FYI, if you have any leftovers, it's even better the next day!

Very tasty! Need to limit liquid intake for next time. Used 1 large bag of tortellini, 1 package of fresh mushrooms, 1/2 bag of spinach (could use more), Alfredo sauce, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 can of chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil, onion powder, salt and pepper. Bake for 1 hour in a 350 degree oven. Top with small bag of mozzarella cheese last 20 minutes.

Both my husband and I loved this. I was in a hurry, misread directions and ended up pouring the sauces directly from the jars into the pot of cooked and drained pasta to which I then added the spinach, Italian seasoning and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I also added hot Italian sausage before topping it with fresh ground mozzarella (don't use packaged, it has cellulose ). I baked it for 20 min. At 400. My measurements were metric vs imperial so approximate.  Despite my errors, this was yummy. I appreciated another reviewer's comments re difference in quality of jarred sauces which I don't usually use. I went on a google search and was very pleased to find Rao sauce (which got a very good rating) in a local grocery store. Will definitely make this again and look forward to making it properly. ??

A simple recipe, definitely. It seems like it is missing something. I think we will be adding a meat next time as there is SO much cheese.

Very easy and very good. I used 24 oz of pasta and doubled the spinach to 20 oz because people complained about it being too saucy. It turned out great.

This was very good. I made it just as the recipe said but I cooked some Italian sausage, chopped it up into bite sized chunks and added it when mixing the pasta and sauce together.

Recipe was a HIT!!! My boys 7 and 15 years old ate it all and then some. A definite keeper in my quick dinner recipe list. I used  (1) Publix 19oz Cheese Tortellini  bag which the pasta comes slightly larger than other brands and the sauce to pasta ratio was ok. I will use slightly less sauce next time around to keep it from overwhelming the pasta. Overall is great dish!

This was so easy to make and delicious! I was going to add sweet italian sausage but forgot, so i will do it next time. Be sure to use a marinara sauce and a good alfredo sauce like Bertolli.

Simmered 1c heavy cream with 1/4 c. butter for the white sauce, added marinara sauce and 1 T It. seasoning and simmered for 10 more min. Added the cooked tortellini. Poured it into 8x8 glass baking dish. Sprinkled Motz and Parm on top, broiled a few minutes. Served with Motz broccoli. Good leftovers too.

Okay, but not something that will go down in the annals of culinary history. I made this for me and my SO, and it was hearty but plain. Not something to serve guests, unless they're like my guests and go into it with lowered expectations (I have...a history).

I halved this recipe and used fresh steamed spinach rather than frozen.  I liked the ease of this recipe and the fact I could make it up early in the day and bake later in the evening for dinner. Since I had a small pan, I baked at 350° for about 20 minutes.  Really enjoy the mixture of the marinara sauce and the Alfredo sauce.  I served this with a toss salad and garlic bread.  Quick easy-peasy meal.

Did not care for the alfredo flavor. It took away from the overall flavor and zest. Bland.

Edible but really not very good.  Like others said too much sauce but even adjusting for that it was not very good. Will not be making again.

This was pretty good. I did omit some ingredients because i didn't have them on hand. So there was no spinach or Alfredo sauce in my rendition of this recipe. I did however cook some groundbeef and added it to the sauce and i also added one can of fire roasted tomatoes and i let the sauce simmer.the ground beef just made the dish hearty. I may use Italian sausage next time and I'll probably tryi it with the omitted ingredients . Good dish!

This worked out really well! I tried to half the recipe but worked with what I had - 10 oz of tortellini, 7.75 oz six-cheese marinara, 7 oz poblano alfredo. I added 1.5 chicken breasts that I cooked in butter with garlic powder and skipped the spinach because Costco was out, hope to try that too next time. Needed to broil about five minutes. end result was awesome!

Loved it and my husband had 2 helpings and took it to work for lunch the next day!  Next time I'm going to try it with chicken ravioli instead of cheese tortellini. Good thing I didn't look at the calorie count before I made it.

It's a good recipe, but the instructions really don't make it clear that you are mixing the sauces together.  I used some cooked chorizo (without the casing) and changed the noodles to penne but did increase the amount of noodles other wise it's a very wet meal.

We enjoyed this a lot, but too much sauce for the recommended pasta. I used 2 - 19 oz pkgs of tortellini, a 9 x 13 dish, baked covered for 20 minutes at 350, and uncovered for 10 minutes. I'll brown a pound of bulk sausage next time to add to the casserole.

I rated this five stars but my wife rated it three and a half so we're settling on four. I thought the flavor was outstanding. The only downside is all the saturated fat caused by the Alfredo Sauce and the cheese. This is a definitely not a low-fat dish.

This was very good, but I'm only rating it 3 stars because when I think "easy" I don't think of a dish that requires 2 colanders, a mixing bowl and 2 pans to make. It also takes more than 30 minutes. The second time I made it, I didnt' even heat up the sauce first, just mixed it in the bowl.  I also found that if I fully cooked the tortellini per package instructions, it came out of the oven overdone (cook it a little less and it's perfect).  All in all a good recipe, but not "easy". And it needs more tortellini.

I loved this!  Made pretty much as written - couldn't locate 'dried' tortellini so I used deli case 'fresh' ones with chicken stuffing.  And for spinach, I thawed it most of the way and then just broke it up and stirred it into sauce a few minutes before adding pasta.  Threw in a bit of oregano too.  Absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to make it again.

I made this last night and followed the advice of one reviewer and used prego onion and garlic sauce and it was pretty good.  I think I might try a meat filled tortellini next time as it was just a bit too much cheese for us, but our toddler loved it, spinach and all!

Super easy and delicious! I used a bag of frozen tortelli from Schwans and fresh baby spinach. My husband is not a pasta fan and he said this is really good! I'll make it again for sure.

This was an easy dish to make. There was hardly any preparation just get the ingredients and start cooking. Great for working parents who don't have a lot of time to be in the kitchen! The only thing is take out is the Italian seasoning because my daughter didn't like it but otherwise for me it's tastes great w/or w/o it

We used 20 oz. fresh pasta, 10 oz. light alfredo sauce (from refrigerated section of store), 5 oz. frozen spinach (half of what recipe called for), added about 3/4 pound of sweet italian sausage, and used just a sprinkling of cheese on top.  The amount of sauce was perfect using this combination.
The recipe was good...but not better than some of my other pasta recipes (which are much simpler!)  The original recipe is just loaded with fat...and even though I made a lot of healthier substitions...it's still pretty unhealthy.  So to us...it's not worth making again.

I run a cooking group at the place where I work, and brought this recipe in for them.  The boys in the cooking group tend to be very picky eaters and tend to stick on the same idea of what to make each week.  This was a totally new dish for them and they loved it!  They also suggested adding chicken next time, which has already been something that I have seen people recommend.  I would also suggest adding more pasta so it is not as soupy.

I made this tonight for dinner and I thought it was just ok.  I would have given it 2 stars, but my DH liked it more than I did.  I followed the recipe exactly and we did not find that there was too much spinach - but in the end the flavour was pretty bland.

We really like this but I though it had too much sauce. So next time I will mix half a jar of marinara & half Alfredo.  Also, only half the box of spianch will do.
