I love this recipe.  I made it to accompany “Becky’s Chicken Salad” it was a wonderful at the Race for the cure brunch I hosted.  I mixed peach and pina colda yogurts with the whipped cream and also added cream cheese and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I used dole tropical fruit salad instead of pineapple.  It was great.  Next time instead of cereal I’m going to use granola bars.

We weren't really big fans of this recipe. Maybe it was the Banana Nut Crunch cereal (??). Next time, I think I'll try experimenting with different cereals and see if it makes a difference.

These were SOOOOOOOOO delicious!!!  It reminded me of a banana split without all the calories!  I will DEFINATELY make these more often!!  I also made this in one big bowl instead of separate cups. It was good that way, too.

Loved it - a snap to put together and the kids were very excited about eating such a "decadent dessert" for breakfast...will make again and try different fruits and maybe a cranberry granola next time.
