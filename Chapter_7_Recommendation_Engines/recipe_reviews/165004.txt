Quick and easy for lunch! Plus, it's a great way to up some leftover rotisserie chicken.  Like others, I subbed feta for the gorgonzola. Overall, very tasty!

This is a super fast/last minute recipe for me.  Left over roasted or rotisserie chicken is great in this and I usually have tons of frozen home made pesto and plenty of spring mix on hand.  The walnuts and apple adds lots of crunch and the gorgonzola (or feta if that's what you have) adds a little tang.  It all makes for a great flavor combination and is healthy too.

The ONLY reason this recipe gets 4 stars is because I altered it a little so I didn't have the same product. But the final product I ate I would get 5 stars for sure! Instead of a wrap I made it a salad and used only spinach leaves, and in instead of gorgonzola I subsituted a tomato basil feta cheese. Absolutely fantastic, definately one of my new favorite eats!

WOW!! That was really awesome I took everyone's advice about the Gorgonzola cheese and used Feta instead and it was really great!!! The apples make for a nice crisp flavor and I seasoned the chicken and cooked it on the grill for a much healthier choice.  But awesome you definitely should try this one!!

The gorgonzola cheese overwhelmed everything else. And I used much less than what the recipe called for.

Great dish and easy to make.  I chose whole wheat wraps instead.  Added fresh spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to the cooked chicken and olive oil.  Used much less cheese.

wow, I have to say that I wasn't really expecting this wrap to have a very good combo of flavors... however, I was seriously mistaken! the pesto, apples and cheese were amazing... however the cheese can be a little over powering. I used spinach instead of spring mix, and spread the pesto over the wrap before I put the other ingredients. Also, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead. I find it difficult to keep breasts juicy. So all said and done, I thought the wrap was extremely filling, and satisfying! I totally recommend it!

This was fast and simple.  I grilled the chicken instead with some seasoning which gave it a bit more flavor and I took the advice of not using so much cheese and it was the right thing to do.

Very good for lunch. I made extra and kept it separate from the lettuce. Stores in the fridge really well!

Delicious! I made this for a girls lunch the other day and everyone loved it.  The crunchiness of the apple and the warmth of the wrap, coupled with delicious tomato pesto and walnuts...oh boy!  It's a keeper for sure! They all wanted the recipe!

Excellent!  I used cashews instead of walnuts, because that's all I had in the pantry, and it was a delight.  Not only do the flavors blend well, but the textures do too.  It's the perfect blend of crunchy and soft, tangy and sweet.  Bravo.  :)

At first you would think what a weird mix of ingredients, but this wrap is AMAZING. The crunch of the walnuts, slight sweetness and tartness of the apples, the tangy flavor of the cheese, the overall recipe is pure genius. A great great recipe. I've made this a bunch of times now and it never gets old and tastes fantastic. Changes I made - I used baby spinach leaves instead of the spring mix and I used Tomato and Basil Feta Cheese. So good.
