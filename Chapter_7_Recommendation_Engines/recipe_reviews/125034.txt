Great snack that won't break the calorie bank especially if you use light cheese!  I always toast my english muffins first before adding the cheese and tomato slices.  I also sprinkled the tomato with a bit of salt and pepper.  Next time I might add a little garlic.  This would be great with just about any kind of cheese you have on hand.

I actually had some pre-packaged Texas Toast that I found in my freezer that I wanted to use up. My oldest boy was the only one who wanted to try this with me so we used the last two slices and went ahead with the recipe. We thought this was just okay. I think it was made better by the use of the Texas Toast (which had garlic butter on it) but not by much. I think it would be better with mayonnaise and more spices.

If your a fan of cheese and tomato sandwiches then you will like this. Exactly the same, just on a bagel. I think it could have used a touch of mayo on the bottom and I did not measure, rather just sprinkled the cayenne to taste.

I thought this was very good! I bought grated parmesan cheese on accident (oops!), but it was still great. I also love cheese, so I added extra cheddar cheese and it was very yummy. 

(Definitely broil it. I made it twice because the first time I was already making something in the oven, so I couldn't put it on the broiler. The bottoms of the bagel burnt while the cheese was still not melted. Though when I used to broiler, everything was perfect.)

This was a hit by all. I omitted the tomato on my son's since he doesn't like tomatoes. I made a few changes to the recipe, I added crumbled bacon, 3 cheese crumbles instead of cheddar cheese, topped the tomato with taco blended shredded cheese and grated parmesan cheese and sprinkled cayenne pepper freely on top. Outstanding late night snack. My husband asked me if there were any more. I will make more next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I topped this little treat with some par-cooked bacon and a few seasonings before broiling. So good Suzanne and thanks!

This is a tasty dish...however my husband suggested that the tomato be put on last, and not broiled. Also, remember other's comfort level of spiciness when sprinkling on that cayenne pepper.....:)  Everyone's tastebuds are different!

This was pretty good, but not really spectacular. I toasted the bagel first, because I was worried it would get soggy otherwise, and added some salt and pepper, but otherwise left things as per the recipe. Some shredded fresh basil would be nice on top. Thanks!

Pretty good!  I think it was a tad boring, maybe some fresh basil would help out?  Overall though it is simple and quick to make.  Thanks!

These are Delicious!!  Had to make seconds.  So easy and so yummy.  I used swiss cheese since I didn't have any fresh parmesan, and they tasted amazing.  I loved the addition of the cayenne.  I also toasted the english muffins.  Great recipe!

Savory fresh sandwich.  I made this with an english muffin in the toaster oven.  Provided a lot of flavor without a heavy feeling when you finish eating it.  This will be wonderful when the fresh tomatoes are ready this summer.  Suzanne thanks for sharing your recipe - love it!

Simple sandwich, great for a quick snack that won't ruin dinner...could use a few more spices to give the flavors a boost. Make sure to use a flavorful tomato in this one since it's the "star" here.  Thx for sharing!

This was really good! I think next time though, I would season the tomato slices with a little salt and maybe some garlic powder, along w/ the cayenne because I felt it could use a little lift. This was still tasty as is and made a nice light lunch. I used a bagel, but would also like to try this with an english muffin, but I think I would toast that first. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

A delicious lunch or snack idea.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I just added ground black pepper afterwards; however it was still delicious.  I will definately be making these again!
