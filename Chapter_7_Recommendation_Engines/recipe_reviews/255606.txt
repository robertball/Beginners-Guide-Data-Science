I love that this recipe uses fresh herbs and veggies. The flavors blend beautifully. I subbed kalamata olives for the proscuitto to make it a meatless dish. I would definitely make again, either as written or a vegetarian version.

So good! I made as directed, but I used my counter top infrared oven to cook this dish. It really helped to crisp up the potatoes nicely and keep their beautiful, vibrant colors. The purple potatoes looked (and tasted) amazing.
It was a hit with my family and I'll be making this often.

Yum! Did make a couple of adjustments but that was just to leave out the bell pepper as I am not a fan of it. Tasted great with the salsa chicken I had made, and the best part was re-heating the leftovers for breakfast the next day. Will make again :).

Delicious! Mine were ready in 15 minutes (then I stirred them) and baked for 10 more minutes rather than 20. Otherwise, followed the recipe and my husband and I enjoyed the color and flavor!
