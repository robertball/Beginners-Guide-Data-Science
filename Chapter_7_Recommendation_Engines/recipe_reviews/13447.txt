I was very excited to find a recipe for ribollita after having some in Florence.  This recipe made a yummy soup!  However, the estimated prep time of 30 min for me was a little short - it took me closer to an hour.  Maybe I will be more efficient and faster next time.  Also, the soup is very thick and I might add some more chicken broth next time.

I did not like this.  The taste was semi-ok, but with uncooked potatoes, over cooked cabbage, and soggy bread, the texture of the soup ultimately stopped me picking at it and throwing the rest out.  Sorry, won't be making again.

This was tasty and fairly simple, a great family meal.  Nutritous, yummy, and inexpensive to make. Made six very hearty servings with leftovers.  I changed the recipe slightly:  omitted the celery and fresh parsley (didn't have it), used half small head of cabbage, two chopped carrots, and one can great northern beans and one can dark red kidney beans, and added three links hot Italian sausage which I browned with the onions.  This is a keeper!

I have now made this soup multiple times with a little extra pepper and have received rave reviews.  I have left out the bread when serving it as part of a meal as it is a very hearty soup that otherwise can be used as a meal in and of itself.  Either way, it's fantastic!

this soup came out very thick - more the consistency of bean and vegetable stew - and had very little flavor.  i tried spicing it up with herbs and spices but it still was pretty blah.  i didn't necessarily expect the  riboletta i had while travelling through italy, but hoped for at least a good vegetable-bean soup.  not here.

We'll probably make this again, but I think it needed more salt and possibly maybe more italian type seasoning.
We didn't do the bread and oven step of the recipe. Instead we ate it like soup and just had garlic bread on the side.

I've made this a few times and my husband raves about it every time. I use leftover homemade bread to make croutons to put the on top on the soup followed by grated parm. I have yet to try the layering, I'm a little wary of the sogginess. Other than that, I follow the minestrone recipe exactly and its a wonderfully flavored meal!

Super good, I didnt have parsley so I added a bunch of oregano instead and was liberal with the pepper.  It turned out great!
