Fabulous!  I made this for my husband's extended family Christmas party, and he was nervous because I was "going up against" years of his aunt's famous cheesy potatoes.  Not only did it get rave reviews, that same aunt told me that several people said it was the best potato casserole they'd had!

I used 2/3 lb turkey bacon, and it was excellent.  I also used light mayo and sour cream despite the warning, and it turned out just fine.  I steamed the potatoes rather than boiling, so they weren't soggy and were evenly cooked.  I had worried that perhaps I shouldn't have cooked them completely before cubing them, since they would be baking so long, but it turns out they needed to be fully cooked, as I believe they would be too crunchy and dry otherwise.

One warning: the estimated time of preparation is very deceiving, since the recipe assumes you've already cooked and prepared both your potatoes and bacon.  I fortunately anticipated this and gave myself plenty of time to prepare.  Depending on how you prepare your potatoes and whether or not you have to fry and crumble/cut up your bacon (rather than using pre-cooked and crumbled bacon off the shelf), you'll be facing quite a bit of preparation time before this recipe begins--as much as a couple of hours depending on distractions.  I wouldn't consider doing this recipe as a regular side dish.  It's definitely a special occasion recipe.

This is an awesome potato casserole!  I used regular pototes so it make a ton!  I could not find minced chives so I did not use them, but it didn't take away from the casserole.  Took this to our office luncheon and it was gone in no time!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make this again and often!!

This recipe is awesome.  So simple to prepare and tastes delicious.  I was very brave and made this recipe and brought to a pot luck at work without trying it out first.  Well it was a hit.  It all went and afterwards  I caught people online looking for the recipe.  Prepared it with all old cheddar cheese and did not add salt and pepper, as I thought the bacon would add enough salt and it did.  You won't be disappointed. After making this several times I find that shredding all the cheese instead of cubing some makes a better recipe.

This was absolutely fantastic.. I only had about 3.5 pounds of baby reds but went ahead with the recipe anyway. I used just under the amount called for for the sour cream and mayo, the same amount of bacon and about 6 cups of cheese. I threw everything into a 9 X 13 pan and away we went. Took it to My In~Laws for Mothers Day and couldn't keep my hubby and my Father~In~Law out of it before dinner. I think this would also be awesome with some pepper jack cheese in for some that like things a little on the spicy side... maybe even throw in some crumbled italian sausage as well to make it a one dish meal. I will be making this quite a bit. Thanks for a great recipe to add to my collection!

What's not to love about this recipe...tastes even better then a loaded baked potato!  I am not sure why the recipe states not to substitute low fat mayo, I used low fat mayo, sour cream, and a low fat cheddar cheese blend and it was to die for...no one knew the difference, it was still rich and creamy packed with flavor!  I put the potatoes in the microwave for 10 minutes first before I cubed them which really cut down on the time!

what a great recipe!!! i used velveeta cheese and sharp cheddar...threw in a few extra green oninons...didn't cook potatoes all the way thinking that baking for 1 hour would continue baking...i was wrong, they were not  as soft as i would have liked.  next time i will cook all the way before baking.

I made it for a department Thanksgiving feast and left the bacon out (due to a co-worker's relgious preferences) but I did put it on the side as a topping for people who do eat bacon and I think I prefer it that way because the bacon stayed crispy. Recipe is very very good. This will definitely be a repeat dish in my household.

Made this for my holiday gathering and it was a big hit. I scaled the recipe in half, and I sauteed the onion with a tablespoon of minced garlic in the bacon grease from when I cooked the bacon. Turned out wonderful.

I felt that four cups of shredded sharp cheddar was plenty, after adding it. A half cup of low-fat mayo and half cup of low-fat sour cream was plenty. The extra salt would have been too much. I did saute the onions before adding them to the potato mixture. Good casserole.

I made this a couple of times since finding it. Once for at home and again today for a pot luck dinner at church. We loved it the first time we tried it. I halved the recipe for us because it does make a lot. I cubed and cooked the potatoes in boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes instead of cooking them whole and then cubing them. Either peeled or not both ways work great. I also sauteed the onion in the same pan I cooked the bacon in after draining almost all of the bacon grease out. Thanks for a great recipe.This dish will take the place of the ones using frozen hash browns and canned soup from now on for us.

I just get tired of my potato rotation occasionally and looked for something different. This is very good. I cubed the spuds and microwaved them with the salt, peper, chives, a little parsley and onion just to soften to cut down on baking time. For bacon, in any recipe, I buy the 16oz real bacon bits bag from Costco. The pieces are much larger than the small jars at the grocery store and the zip lok bag keeps well in the freezer. You can't tell the difference from frying it and cutting it yourself. I add 1/2c milk to the mayo/sour cream mixture to give it a creamier, less thick texture. I had leftovers so the first night it went with steaks and the next night grilled chicken. Adding this to the "spud recipe" file. Just a note...to make this on a busy evening or when you can't take the time for the steps as written, use the bacon in the bag and the cube cut style potato's next to the hash browns/french fries in the freezer section and you're set:)

Every month my church is responsible to contribute to the meals of homeless people.  I usually bring beans, macaroni and cheese or lasagna,  I decided to try this recipe for a treat.  It was so flavorfull.  I was happy to bring a little extra because of the Thanksgiving holiday.  You can't go wrong on this one.

I altered this recipe to make it healthier, I used 6 potatoes, 1 onion diced, 2 cups shredded cheddar, 1/2 cup fat free sour cream, 1/2 cup fat free ranch dressing, sprinkled top with real bacon pieces and Emeril's Essence made with No Salt. I boiled the onion with the potatoes to soften. My family really liked this, I found it perfect the way I made it, cheesy enough and tasty, plus saved a ton of calories and fat.

This was certainly worth fixing, but as usual I made a few changes. I cubed and boiled my red potatos with the chopped onion. I replaced the ham with bacon (and left out the salt), and instead of using just mayo to go with the sour cream I used half mayo and half ranch dressing. Also a baked potato taste isn't complete without butter so before mixing the sour cream/mayo/dressing in I tossed the cubed cooked potatoes with melted butter. I also cut WAY back on the cheese. 8 cups is just too much. I also mixed in quite a bit more black pepper and added dried greek oregano. Once it came out of the oven I sprinkled cooked crumbled bacon, chopped green onions, and shredded cheddar over the top. This one will go in my box of  last minute "emergency" recipes! Good stuff!

This is SPECTACULAR!  I cut the recipe in half and still had enough for a 9X13 dish.  This is NOT a recipe for those watching their calories, that's for sure.  But it made a fantastic side dish for my Father's Day dinner.  It can easily be made the day ahead, which is awesome.  I highly recommend this potato casserole.  Thanks, Karen!

This was delicious. However, it lost a star as my huband said the mayo added too strong of a flavor. I'll cut the amount of mayo next time around. My picky brother loved this and I ate a sceond large helping of it tonight for dinner. Definately a new favorite.

There's a reason so many people have saved this recipe - it's so  good!  I didn't have cubed cheddar cheese so substituted with Havarti and another hard expensive cheese I had. It tasted great and I think a bit more complex! I believe all 14 guests at Christmas dinner helped themselves to seconds!

These are amazing! I scaled it down using the calculator on here but increased the sour cream, simply because I love it so much, but it probably wasn't necessary. When I mixed the wet mixture with potatoes and bacon I was concerned it wasn't enough sauce but it turned out great! Also I just sprinkled the chives on after cooking because I forgot to throw them in(I think it made them prettier!) Took a long time from start to finish but it wasn't hard or something I had to keep a close eye on. Worth the wait!

First, let me say that this dish was delicious, but I had to modify it a bit. The amount of cheese (8 cups total) was a bit much in my opinion, so I scaled it down to 6 cups and had plenty of cheese. I also used only 1/2 pound of bacon and felt it was enough bacon flavor. Because of this, I used twice the amount of salt. I will definitely make again. Thanks!

Very Good!  Made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a hit.  I halved the recipe - however I did keep the mayo and sour cream at 1 cup each.  Tried 1/2 a cup of each first, and it seemed a bit dry.  So I added the remaining to make 1 cup each.  I also added one green pepper diced.  Great yummy dish!!

Oh my gosh... this recipe is absolutely the best!!!  I made this for Christmas dinner for my family.  Everyone absolutely raved over it and asked for the recipe.  The recipe (as shown) does make quite a bit, but I am glad, because I now get to enjoy the little bit that was leftover!!!

I did use 5 lb. bag of red potatoes plus added 2 more.  Also, I used green onions instead of regular onion - used 2 bags of Hormel real grated bacon (I think it is new... it was next to the bacon bits).  I used Vegannaise instead of real mayo (no cholesterol - dairy/egg free) and light sour cream.  I also did not use as much cheese.  I used a cup of the Kraft cheddar cheese crumbles and then 2 c. of shredded cheddar cheese.

I cannot wait to make this again just for dinner and it will now be the dish I offer to make for every holiday... just so I can be sure that it will be there!!!  

It tastes like a cross between a baked potato with everything on it and baked potato skins... SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Delicious! For the cubed cheese, I used velveeta (as an interpretation of the recipe--i'm not sure what difference cubed/shredded is supposed to make), and used 4c regular shredded cheese. Fantastic! Got rave reviews and make it for every family function.

A VERY worthy dish that pleased my 3, 7 and 10 year olds as well as me and my wife.  I did everything per the instructions except I used an additional 1/2 tsp of salt & pepper. I may have been a and ounce or two over on my bacon as well. I also scaled the recipe down to 8 servings down from the 20 the original calls for.  It made enough to have for a second dinner.

Glad I tried it but won't make it again.  Not a huge fan of regular hashbrown casserole but this wasn't even that good -- less flavor, funky texture -- and certainly no easier to make.  Actually threw out half of it.

Great comfort food.  I made this dish for a funeral reception (I had to double the reception).  Everyone loved it.  My family (both immediate and extended) asked me to make it for Christmas dinner.  It's a hit.  I followed the reception exactly as written.

Incredible!  I scaled the recipe down for 4 and used much less cheese.  I also used light mayo and sour cream.  The casserole puffs up nicely. This would be great with steaks off the grill. I think you can alter the amount according to your tastes.  It is a winner recipe!

This is the new go to potato casserole that your guests will love.  It is so easy and a pretty presentation.  I cut back on the cubed cheese by one cup and it still had more than enough.  This is a great 'special' dish for your holiday buffet.  My adult kids couldn't get enough of it and I had no leftovers for the next meal.  Everyone that I have served it to has asked for the recipe!

Made this on Easter to accompany my brother-in-law's Greek leg of lamb--which is always great!  This recipe added a twist on the menu and everyone agreed...was absolutely delicious!  Based on some of the reviews, we did cut back by about 1/3, on the cheese cubes and added about 1/3 less shredded on top to brown up the last 10 or so minutes of baking.  Probably cooked 10 to 15 minutes longer also since we made sure the potatoes were firm when adding to rest of ingredients--wanted to make sure the potatoes held up (cut in smallish cubes). Also sauted the onion and 2 garlic cloves in a little  of the bacon drippings.  Added garlic salt and pepper to taste...we always add these 2 ingredients to practically everything...and the result was an excellent dish!  We very seldom eat this type of food, so when we do...it better be worth the calories...It definitely was!!!

It was everything I had hoped it would be!!  I had to cut the recipe in half because there is only 3 of us and that was still alot.  I did substitute green onions for the onion and used much less bacon.  My husband even commented on it and he usually dosen't have much to say.  Will definately be making this again and soon.

I made this for Christmas dinnner to go with ham.  I left out the bacon and it was delicious.  It would definitely be great with the bacon.  This is a keeper.

I've made this twice-once as written, but with veggie bacon and tonight I made it with no chives and instead added some dill and garlic salt so it sort of tasted like ranch. Both times were yummy! Not a low-fat dish, but definitely a keeper=)

I made this in place of baked potatoes and it was a big hit!  I used some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and made my own modifications: 

1) I cut the sour cream, mayo and cheese amounts by about a third and it was still creamy enough.  
2) I split the cheddar amount into half cheddar and the other half monterey pepper jack for a little extra kick.  
3) I boiled the chopped onion with the potatoes to soften the onion taste.
4) I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top before baking.
5) I added the bacon bits and chives on top after it was finished baking instead of adding them to the potato mixture before baking.

The other reviewers are right.  You have to allow enough time to cook the potatoes before you can even start this recipe.

This is delicious!!!! Might take a little longer to make than opening a bag of frozen hashbrowns but it is worth it!!! I plan to take it to the next potluck I go to...(I didn't have chives so I just used parsley, but I have bought chives since for the next time).

Yum! I'm vegetarian so I used soy bacon instead of the real stuff. Also went with low fat mayo and sour cream. In my opinion, it turned out just fine.

I'm debating back and forth between 4 stars and 5 stars.  4 for me because it was really good but not out of this world, but my husband has declared it his new favorite side dish so that automatically bumps it up to a 5.  And to the person who rated this recipe a 1 because they had to bake it for an hour and the potatoes were still hard.......re-read the directions.  It states that you are suppose to use cooked potatoes!   User error, not recipe error so try this one anyways:)

This dish was so easy to prepare, I made it the night before then reheated in the oven the next day. I didn't add as much cheese as the recipe stated as I thought it would be too greasy. It was cheesy, bacony and delish all rolled into one. Chopped green or red pepper would have been nice in it as well...next time!

I've had many potato casseroles and this is now my all time favorite.  I changed it a little.  I baked idaho potatoes the morning before and diced those up when they had cooled.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was able to make the entire dish the day before and just put it in the oven on Christmas day.  Next time I won't use the cubed cheese - all shredded would have worked just fine.

What a great recipe to play with depending on what you like!  I added green chilis for a spicy twist and queso fresco because I had it available.  I omitted the mayonnaise because I have picky eaters and added 1/2 and 1/2 instead.  My family thought I was brilliant.. thanks Allrecipes :)

The first thing I did was have AR calculate this down to 6 servings.  It was very good but a little on the rich side with all those ingredients.  However the prep time is way off, more like 30-40 minutes if not longer. I can't say this will be a weekly dish but will probably be great for parties.

I will cut down the servings to adjust for having it for three of us. The fresh made bacon bits made this delicious

I halved the recipe, but other than that, made it as written. It's a good base recipe, but felt like something was missing. Next time I make it, I'm going to add more bacon and pepper & throw in mushrooms...and will omit the mayo and just use sour cream. Thanks!

I halved this recipe because it seemed like a lot for my family.  I used butter potatoes and it turned out wonderful.  I made this to go with our Easter ham and it went well.  Also used fresh chives instead of dried ones (recipe doesn't say which type) and the freshness of them was nice in this dish.  Had requests to make again and they hadn't even finished what was on their plates!

Nothing healthy about this recipe but boy is it good!  Changed the prep a bit and changed only one of the cheeses.  Used a combo crumble of cheddar and jack instead of cubed cheddar.  Put the potatoes and onion in a skillet with some butter first to cut down on baking time.  Just sauteed for a few minutes.  I upped the oven temp. to 350 don't think it made a difference.

Was invited to a friend's family gathering.  Decided to make the dish because of the positive reviews.  I told myself, "I probably won't ever see these people ever again so who cares if they don't like the dish?"  Well they all loved it and I am invited to every family gathering and I have to make the baked potato casserole.

One word to describe - AWESOME!  I took this side dish to a Mother's Day cookout and it was a real crowd pleaser.  The only change I made was to use real bacon pieces from a jar (2) and I cut the chedder and sharp cheddar to 2 cups each.  That was plenty of cheese for this dish.  Even my fussy nephew gave me a "thumb's up".  Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely awesome!  I wanted to try something new for our Christmas dinner this year, and am so glad I found this recipe!  My family loved it and my husband has already asked (repeatedly) when we can have it again.  He used the leftovers to make breakfast with eggs & ham, and it was OUTSTANDING!!!  The only thing I didn't care for was the strong onion taste, but will try boiling the onion with the potatoes as mentioned in  other reviews.  Prep time wasn't bad at all, but I also boiled the potatoes the day before.  All in all, this is an outstanding recipe and can't wait to have it again!  :-)

Had sour cream w/chives I needed to use. (husband bought by mistake). I found this recipe on all-recipes. Wonderful! Followed a reviewers tip who suggested steaming the potatoes instead of boiling them. They turned out perfect. I will use this tip often. Used what cheese I had and adjusted for the amount of potatoes I had. It's a very forgiving recipe. Except for the calories. I agree with another reviewer. It is a special occasion recipe. Holidays, cook-outs etc...But I will make this again.

My husband and I made this for Easter dinner and it was fantastic! We did make a few adjustments though: I thought 8 cups of cheese was way too much, so I cut it down to 6. Also, I went ahead and substituted light mayo and light sour cream, despite the warning. Even with these changes, the casserole turned out great, and you couldn't tell that the substitutions were even made! We will definitely make this again, and maybe try turkey bacon instead of regular.

I made a double batch for church.  I only cubed 7 bricks of sharp cheddar (didn't shred any...worked out good, but shredding would probably be better) and added 4 oz of very potent blue cheese and 4 oz of pepperjack cheese.  The blue and pj cheese was a great addition but probably could have cut back on a brick of cheddar....and I love cheddar....just thought it was a little much.  Followed the rest of the recipe.  Eveyone loved it and got requests for the recipe.

I modified this to be healthier and it was fantastic! (Just don't tell the guys) I left out the bacon, added a can of artichoke hearts, chopped and substituted nonfat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Oh, and I also substituted about a 1 1/2 cups of the cheddar cheese for shredded Parmesan. 
Everybody loved it!

Apparently I goofed this up.  It just didn't go over well at all.  I had a dinner guest who does not eat pork.  So, I tried turkey bacon and I thought it tasted awful and will never use turkey bacon again.  I also used shredded hash browns instead of cubed fresh potatoes and maybe shouldn't have taken that short cut.  I expected a creamier texture, but seemed dry. Based on all the rave reviews I am going to give it another try.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  It was the BEST, sssoooooo freakin good, but I think I gained 10 pounds after I ate it.  I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe!

Tasty! I did like one reviewer suggestion of serving the bacon seperate and adding at the end, keeps it crunchy! I also like a little sour cream for the top before serving.

I was uncomfortable about using a full lb of bacon for the calories but my niece's boyfriend said that he liked this recipe because it was included.  I would definitely make it again but cut the recipe in half.  It makes alot! :)

Terrific! So glad I choose this to go with Easter dinner. Followed recipe except for adding garlic powder, cajun spice, parsley and dill to sour cream-mayo mixture for more taste.  Makes a lot even with the red potatoes!

I'm sure it tastes good (smells good!) but it was in the oven for an hour and the potatoes were still hard - so I covered it to try and soften them that way and am still cooking it almost an additional hour later.  I'm not sure what happened but it just isn't working out.

Great tasting!  I used less cheese than the recipe called for and it turned out fine.  Also, I used the pre-cooked bacon to save on time.  Low fat cheese and mayo would be a good option for lower calories.

Sooo good!  I've made this a handful of times now and don't think there is any way you can be disappointed with this recipe.  A couple of times I've substituted the sour cream (just because I didn't have any on hand) with buttermilk or Greek yogurt and it has turned out amazing every single time.  I also like to substitute the chives and onion with green onion (one less ingredient to buy & chop).  I've received many, many compliments on this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I omitted the bacon, but used cheddar and smoked gouda cheese that I had on hand. I made it to use up some leftover dip from Thanksgiving which had a mayo/sour cream base.

My family LOVED these potatoes.  I cut the the recipe in half, this made enough to fill a 9 X 12 pan.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I even warmed up the very small amount of leftovers and had them for breakfast.  I will make this again and again.

WOW everyone loved this recipe!  I wanted to try something new at Thanksgiving so I tried this recipe and everyone loved it.  I have added this to our menu at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.  This is one of about three recipes that I can actually get everyone in my picky picky family to eat.  It is wonderful left over and reheated.  When I made it I cooked the potatos the day before and threw it all together right before cooking.  Trust me you won't be disappointed.

Made a couple minor changes. Completely peeled potatoes as kids don't like the peels. Used low fat mayo (1/2 c) Low fat sour cream, all shredded cheddar rather than cubed and shredded. I did not mix the bacon inside, but rather put it on top and then topped with shredded cheddar before baking. Delicious - good reviews.

This cassarole was really good, my whole family loved it! The only thing that i think should change is, u probably should add some more bacon to even out the meat and vegitable portions. Other then that this cassarole will work for any occation.

Outstanding! How can it not be with those ingredients? A better alternative to the cheesy hash brown casserole. I microwaved the potatoes and left them unpeeled, so it was quick to prepare. I have no idea the purpose of calling for some shredded and some cubed cheese, so I just used all shreds and it worked fine. Looking forward to leftovers!

I am now specifically asked to bring my "heart attack potatoes" to most functions, and have had many requests for the recipe. Several of my friends have made this for family gatherings with the biggest disapoointment being there are never any leftovers to bring home!A definite keeper...thank you very much for sharing!

This was really tasty and my husband loved it!  I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I mixed in Jack and Colby too - this is probably more to our taste than using all cheddar anyway.  I also left out the bacon because it didn't really go with our main dish, although I think it would be a great addition.  Definitely will make this one again!

Made this dish for Christmas dinner at my son-in-law's house.  Incredible!  Addded a bit more chives and made a little bit more sour cream and mayonnaise misture to make sure it was moist.  Par boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes and then drained.  Sauted the onions in a little butter to make them soft.  Only used about half of the sharp cheese in the dish and added the rest on top the last 15 minutes of baking.  This was so good!

This is also a great way to use that leftover ham.  I've made this many times using ham cut into 1-inch cubes and then it becomes more like a meal than just a side dish.  My family really likes this one. Make sure you cook the potatoes completely, as stated in the instructions.  The first time I made this, I just par-boiled them and it wasn't as good.

This is our new favorite.  I always made basic scalloped potatoes which were good but took forever to cook through.  These are perfect!  I did as some suggested and boiled the chopped onions with the potatoes.  I catered my son's wedding this past Saturday and made theses for 150 people and they were a giant hit!  I just found the recipe two weeks ago and have already made them four times.  And I think I'll make them again today.  Good choice!  And don't worry about the fat and calories.  This is so worth it!

Love this recipe. I don't use a such bacon or cheese as it calls for but that's just personal preference. I've made it a day before and just set it out about a half hour before I pop it in the oven. We love having them with bbq ribs!

I've taken this to my in-laws, work and made it for friends....everybody asks for the recipe.  I perfer eating light, so I tried it with light mayo.  That was a mistake.  The texture really changed.  So, stick to the whole mayo and whole sour cream.  Excellent!

I made this for a family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  It traveled well,stayed hot and was something different than mashed potatoes or the hashbrown casseroles I've made in the past!!  Great potluck food!

YUM!  So good!  I thought it was a perfect addition to my prime rib Christmas dinner!  I didn't think it was too heavy or creamy - just right!  I will definitely make it again with some steak.

Amazing!! I already have to make this again this weekend, by request! The ONLY thing I did was with the baked potatoe part. I cut the potatoes in slices3/4 of the way down, then I drizzled them with Olive Oil, then sprinkled the potatoes with Lawreys Season Salt and baked, then cut up the potatoes in cubes and mixed in and did recipe as it says!

I don't usually rate something that I haven't tasted, but I took these to a gathering and did not get any....they were gone!  My son was fortunate enough to have a huge helping and said they were awesome and wanted me to make them again for supper the next night.  Kind of unhealthy for an every day meal.  I got nothing but raves, compliments, and recipe requests!  I used all shredded cheddar, left out the chives, and only baked for about 35 min.  Thanks for sharing the recipe...definately a keeper!

Fabulous!!! I made this for a ladies brunch, and it was a HIT! Everybody wants the recipe! I substitued crumbled turkey breakfast sausage for the bacon because that's what I had, and it worked great. I used regular best foods mayo & fat free sour cream, and chopped green onions only.  And I lowered the salt to 1/2 tsp. instead of 1 tsp. It was really great, and I would definitely make this again, and am adding it to my favorite recipes!!! Thanks!!

This is very good and sinful - almost too rich and heavy for me.  Just took a very small helping to totally fill me up.  The guys however, devoured this.  I would just advise serving a very light main dish to go with this.

This tasted ok.  The bacon gets rubbery (crispy when put in the casserole) and my husband couldn't get over the texture of the bacon.

I like creamy and this was creamy but it had too much "tang" for me.

WOW!!!  Awesome!  I had no chives and didn't add pepper, but it was perfect without them.  I was concerned that there would not be enough mayo and cheese mixture but it was perfect.  I only baked it about 30 minutes too, but it was hot and juicy.  YUM!!!

This is obviously a cholesterol nightmare, but worth every fat gram.  Has a wonderful, decadent flavor.  I fixed only half, and had plenty for several meals. Would make an excellent dish to take to a pot luck, where everyone eats only a small helping.  Mine required a longer cooking time (for a half recipe) by about half an hour, but I am cooking at 6000'.  Would allow extra time, however, for the cheese to fully melt even at lower altitudes.

I made this recipe for overnight company - and the next morning I discovered they had raided the refrigerator overnight and had eaten the rest of the potatoes!   Excellent recipe - except additional salt was not needed because of the bacon and cheese having more than enough salt.  I didn't have bottled dry chives so I used fresh instead.  Will make again!!!!!

I took this to my son's pot luck, end-of-band-camp dinner.  I served it in a blue glass lasagna pan and I had a lady tracking the pan to ask for the recipe at the end of the night, lol!  I was told by the lady manning the table, that everybody wanted the recipe, SO, it was a fabulous success!  It disappeared super quick.   I only used about 3.5lbs of potatoes, about 4 to 5 cups of cheese (sprinkled 1/2 c on top about 10 min's before it was done).  I also only used 12 strips of bacon and half of a large onion.  I used the full amount of sr cream and red. fat mayo. Prepared the day before, then cooked about 1 hour.

Everyone loved this recipe.  They liked it much better than the old hash brown casserole.  It looked a little funky when I mixed it but it turned out great when it was cooked.  I put the bacon on top like someone else suggested.  I tried one without the bacon and it was still good.  Takes more time than the old one but I will make it again.

This is delicious.  After making it a couple times I now add the bacon at the end instead of cooking it with the caserole to keep it crispy.  Also, it's better if you let it sit for several minutes before serving.  Even better reheated the next day!

I get nothing but rave reviews and recipe requests when I serve this...the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that 8 cups of cheese is a bit excessive.  Other than reducing the cheese to about 4 cups I make it as written and it's delicious.

Great Recipe!!! My family loved it! I used a sweet onion. After I cooked the bacon,I sauteed the sweet onion in the left over bacon grease. Then added it to other ingredients. I also always salt my potatos while ccoking...no extra salt needed.

I wanted something different from the standard "hash brown casserole".  This recipe is a total winner.  My family and guests always rave about it and there's never any leftovers, no matter how much I make. I use whatever type of potatoes I have on hand, but other than that I don't monkey with the standard recipe; it seems perfect just the way it is.

Yummy! i felt so naughty eating it as i have been trying to eat low fat ( think that made it extra special ) I did make a small change the secound time i made it, i added garlic and some diced chillie ( seeds removed ) to give it some extra flavour but this is not needed just a preference of mine.

This was awesome!  I cut back on the cheese a little bit.  I used a big block of mild cheddar and a small block of sharp.  It made a 9x13 and a 8x8 pan.  It was a perfect side to our Christmas ham and my family loved it.
