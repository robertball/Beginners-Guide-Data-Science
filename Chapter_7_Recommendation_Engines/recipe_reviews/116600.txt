amazing that one can take a cheap brach caramel and turn it into something that tastes like a million bucks!  These were a snap to prepare.  Used parchment paper sprayed and I did not have the sticking problem at all.   they came off in one piece with not so much as a smear left on the paper.  Used a metal cookie scoop to diminish the sticky finger syndrome.  Popped them in the fridge which made the dipping easier; the chocolate immediately set to the candy. I can't think of a better nut to use than the pecan; this complimented the caramel perfectly. thanks for this super easy recipe that presents well.

At my first attempt, I cut the recipe in half just to try it out, and it's a good thing I did! Mistake #1, I used wax paper to set the hot caramel onto. (trying to save space in my fridge) And the caramel was barely salvagable since I had to saw it off the paper. Which was my fault, I should have paid more attn to the directions. Mistake #2, was when I melted the chocolate chips in a small sauce pan over low heat. I hate my electric stove for this reason. I never can tell how low, the low setting really is.  I burned the chocolate in less than a minute.  I learned how quickly you can make smooth chocolate look like fudge and there was no turning back. So, the next time I attempted this recipe everything went perfectly!  I used a pam sprayed cookie sheet to set the hot caramel in the fridge. I then placed a small pyrex mixing bowl over a medium pot of heated water (on the lowest setting). The chocolate stayed smooth until I was done dipping. The dipping is the tricky part. I used my fingers more than anything, and the chocolate was hot! I had tried tooth picks but that was too tricky. Some other things I'd mention is that once cold, the caramel can be tough to remove from the baking sheet, but a butter knife and some pressure works fine. Oh, and I used cocoa crispies since it was what I had on hand, and pulsed my pecan pcs in my small food processor just to make finer chunks and a nuttier taste in every bite. Since I was giving these out with other baked goods, I individually

These are delicious! They were a big hit and went FAST! My only suggestion would be to make sure you really grease the wax paper because they really stick! Will definately make again!

These were very good.  Can't have just one! The first step is very sticky, so be sure to use the wax paper. I sprayed everything (spatula etc) with Pam.  People are surprised that only few items are needed to get such a great candy.

I think of all the different cookie recipes I made this year, this was BY FAR the favorite of those who ate them... and to think they were probably the easiest of all to make! Taking the advice of other reviewers, I used parchment paper lightly sprayed with Pam to prevent sticking. Rather than dipping the entire cookie in chocolate, I dipped only the bottoms and then put a small dollop of chocolate in the centers on top. This made them rather eye-catching, in my opinion, and made them a heck of a lot easier AND cleaner to handle and store. Plus, the chocolate didn't overwhelm the caramel that way. Simply put, these are easy and fantastic and will be a staple in my kitchen.

These are absolutely outstanding. I thought they would be too sweet and rich but they are surprisingly addictive.  Its like eating a mini candy bar.  They sure went fast in my house.  It was definitely worth the time and effort, and I will make these again for sure.

My Mother made this for years every Christmas and when she passed away I found her recipe.  She made it without the cereal.  She also put the carmel mixture in the freezer for a couple of hours and it pops off the pan much easier and makes it easier to handle in the chocolate.

These are delicious! Like a wonderful cross between turtles and 100 Grand (two of my favs!) The only change I made to the recipe itself was to use 2 cups milk chocolate chips and 1 cup semi-sweet, because that's what I had. 

As far as following directions - I've burned stuff on my electric stove before, so I melted everything in a makeshift double-boiler. (Honestly, where would I be in life without my Pyrex bowls?!) Caramels took a little longer to melt this way I think, but it was WORTH IT. (Besides, I had already spent 2 hours shelling my own pecans - I was already invested! At that point, what's an extra few minutes?)

Word of advice - be generous when greasing the waxed paper, if that's what you're using! One sheet turned out fine, one sheet stuck to the caramels (it's just a little extra fiber, right?) Next time I might try the silicon baking sheets I always forget I have...

Did NOT get 32 tasty treats - I used my mixing spoon instead of a teaspoon to drop the caramels and they ended up HUGE! But they're so yummy that no one cared! Next time I will try to make them smaller, though - they looked a little overwhelming this time. Took them to the Academy Awards party and my friends raved about them! Thanks for a keeper!

I felt it could've used less nuts and more cereal with more amounts as well, it was still pretty caramel-y.  Tasty little treats though.  I didn't bother with the fridge step, by the time I dropped them on the sheet then went back to roll them they were already cooled.  I used confectioner's coating instead of chocolate chips.

Holy cow. I added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the caramel before I added the nuts and rice, and I may have to make a batch for myself.

These really do taste like little candy bars.  After reading many reviews, I made a few changes.  I upped the cereal to almost 2 full cups, reduced the pecans to about 3/4 cup and skipped the refrigeration.  I was concerned about making these round and presentable as I was using them for gifts at Christmas.  I used my small cookie scoop and dropped the mixture onto my Silpat.  After dropping around 6-8 of them, I would go back and roll them into balls.  They were much easier to handle sitting for a few minutes, cooling down.  After dropping and rolling them all, I then refrigerated the balls overnight, and dipped them in the chocolate the next morning.  They turned out nice and round and I added Christmas sprinkles for presentation. I think these would also be great for Easter, as it would not be that difficult to shape into Easter Egg form.

My husbands new favorite candy.  This is a great recipe.  I only coated the bottoms w/ chocolate because we love caramel and I didn't want to take away from the flavor of the caramel.  Will make these time and time again.  Easy to make too.

I did not like these. The flavor was nice enough and they're definitely easy but the texture was sticky and thick and they coated my teeth in an odd way. Everytime I had one I ran to brush the coating off my teeth...strange huh? Must be just me...

These are great, but a bit too sweet with just milk chocolate. I like to mix milk and semi-sweet to cut some of the sweetness from the caramel.

Delicious! These are wonderful and easy.  I will make them again.  I used walnuts instead, because I didn't have pecans, and I used semi sweet chocolate chips because that is what I had.  Make sure you grease the wax paper well,(I used butter) and I ended up spooning the melted chocolate over them because I was burning my fingertips.

I have made many candies... This one is a winner and easy too! 
Here are some tips that work for me:
*Small melon-baller ice-cream scoop type works wonders for bite size bon-bons.
*Try plopping any sticky treat out onto a tray of nuts, or rice cereal! Roll or spoon and coat for even more added texture. Adds another dimension to your treat. Be careful to shake off excess, as it WILL float into your chocolate bath... or double dip... one for the initial dip without shaking off excess (try white or dark chocolate for a surprise) Let set then dip in clean chocolate bath. 
* Be generous with your melted chocolate in your dipping bath. Less wresting. You can always scrape it into a vacuum seal bag or container...LABEL and use again

One of my students made these for me and I just had to have the recipe. She made a batch with the rice cereal and one without and they were all amazing. Teachers kept coming in my classroom to steal them all day long, they were awesome!  This is by far one of the best treats I have ever had or made!! Easy to make and something everyone loves.

I tooo forgot the spray on the wax paper but remembered after a couple of minutes, mine came off fine.  With the chocolate, I also used semi-sweet and instead of trying to dip them, I just put them in the pan with the chocolate, about 4 at a time, coated them with a teaspoon and then picked them out and sat them on the wax paper again.  This way, no mess on the fingers and it was easy to coat before the chocolate got to hard.  I also have a electric stove and I kept my chocolate at 2 and put a little olive oil in to keep it from hardening up...the RESULT...Fantisamo!!!
Will definately make again!

I absolutely could not find branches carmel so I went with Carmel balls for the Christmas season from Kraft. Actually, I think this is much prefered because they are small and melt easier. It was only an 11 oz bag, but worked well with the same nuts and crispy. I did however, reduce water to 2 TBS. At first I thought I had too much water and almost added more carmel (from a second bag), but then it seemed to cream out. Mine all fit onto one cookie sheet. I sprayed everything with PAM, the parchment paper, spoon, spatula and used a teflon pan. Everythign was awesome until the chocolate step. I got the chocolate melted pretty quickly, so took the shet out before 10 minutes. I could have coated them, but decided to leave them on the sheet and jut drizzle over. Next time I will use Semi sweet to reduce sweetness a bit. As I worked quickly the chocolate got hard and almost powdery...I tried everything to keep it smooth, but nothing worked. So I ended up clumping chocolate on some and then smearing and pushing it down on them to make smooth. those are definately not as smooth and nice looking, but the taste should be similar. next time I will make two batches of chocolate to lengthen my time to get it on. Also, I only used 1 bag (just over 2 cups) and I had left over. I also only did 1 tsp of shortening. Not really sure what that is for, never did that before. I will make them again, but with the changes I made above. I might even try putting the mixture into a cookie cutter for Ch

These have disappeared quickly every time I have made them this holiday season and been a big hit at Christmas cookie exchanges!  I love "turtles" and these are a great homemade version.  Just make sure to melt your chocolate on low - on my electric stove I turn off the heat after it has warmed up a bit.

Yum! I wanted to try something new for my gifts of
"Christmas Goodies" that I'll give away this year, and these did not disappoint. I gave most it away at the Senior Center where I do volunteer work and they loved them. Then again, they always love it when I experiment in the kitchen and let them be my taste testers, haha. I used a small scoop sprayed with Pam to drop the candy. Last year I bought a Wilton candy fork to dip candy into chocolate with and it makes the job so much easier. I used my double boiler to melt the chocolate and was able to let the chocolate sit over the hot water while dipping the candy making it all so much easier. Thanks June

Wow... these are fantastic! Like a turtle but w/ rice krispies in them too. I miss read and did 1 1/2 C. Rice kripies and 1 C. Chopped nuts (pulsed in food processor to make the same size as the cereal). I added 1 TBSP extra of water b/c it is so dry where I live (desert). I used 2 spoons sprayed w/ cooking spray and used them to scoop onto my 2 silpats. I had to respray the spoons once b/c the mixture started to stick to them. Let them cool for 2 hrs and melted the chocolate by dbl boiler method. I used a spoon and fork to help flip and coat the caramel candies, then put them back on the silpat. I let them sit covered w/ plastic wrap over night and removed them. Easier to remove if you place in the freezer for about an hour before taking them off. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

If the candy is sticking to waxed paper, a short time in the freezer will solve that issue. They come right off. I gave it only 4 because of how messy/sticky these are. I used 2 cups of cereal  and cut down on the pecans. Hardly noticible for taste to change these ingredients around.  I tried to paint the melted chocolate on with a little spoon, rather than dipping the whole thing in. Tasty treats.

These turned out really good. Spray the wax paper and spoon/scoop well with Pam and you won't have sticking problems.  I will use more shortening in the dipping chocolate in the future to make the dipping easier and not so thick on the candy.  A truffle recipe I use says 1 TB shortening to 1 cup chocolate chips for dipping and it works much better than the ratio I used for these candies.  Very easy and really tasty.

Super Easy-the only hint I have to offer is to make sure the caramel mixture is really cold when you go to dip them. They tended to get sticky after a few minutes.

These were really good, but not exceptional for me.  However, I had one friend that raved about them.  The only change that I made was adding 1/4 block of Gulfwax to the chocolate chips instead of the shortening.  Wax thins the chocolate out just right for dipping, sets quicker and makes the coating shiny.

This recipe was great. I did not have pecans on hand but had walnuts and they still turned out well. Took them to my x mas party , and had many request for the recipe. Next time I make them I am going to try and add a small amount of peanut butter in them , I think it would be a good mixture.

I made these at a cookie baking get together with friends.  They were easy to make.  I followed others suggestions and sprayed Pam cooking spray on everything.  I didn't let the candies set enough after covering in chocolate and they melted into each other a little.  I didn't care for the flavor of the candy after I dipped into milk chocolate. I have an extreme sweet tooth and they didn't taste as sweet with the chocolate.   I'll try to make without dipping or try another type of coating for next time.

Shipped these cross-country to my boyfriend for his birthday. Absolutely delicious, and super easy to make! To keep them from sticking during shipping (they soften a bit at room temperature) I placed them in individual cupcake liners and then in a tupperware container. PERFECT!

Not what I was looking for, but they are tasty. Ended up being quite a bit of work because  I could not get them off the greased non stick waxed paper!  Looked online and there was a suggestion to put a cookie sheet in the oven at 175, when heated, set the waxed paper with the billionaires on top of the heated cookie sheet.  That softened enough to remove them.

I dont enjoy pecans so I just added an extra 1/2 cup of rice cereal. Before dipping them in the chocoalte I was able to roll them into balls. I did not use nearly all the chocoalte either, I think it could be cut in half.

These are awesome.  I was going to make 2 batches and accidentally put double the amount of pecans in my first batch.  They turned out perfect. I highly recommend using a cookie dough scoop to form the balls.  These are rich so I recommend making them small.  Thanks for sharing..... enjoy!

These were a huge hit for Christmas! I made them to give as gifts at my husbands family gathering on Christmas Eve and they were gone almost as soon as they were opened. Two bits of advice though, keep some cooking spray handy to coat your spoons with for portioning out the caramel mixture and I found teaspoon size portions really best, otherwise these candies can be a bit much....although no-one complained when they came across the larger ones :)

Well, I am glad to say the last one of these is finally gone and I'm glad.  I think I've gained 5 pounds from eating most of two whole batches of these over the holidays!  They are out of this world!  Not sure why others say they are difficult and messy to make. It's one of the simplest recipes you'll find and you'll get rave reviews like you've really worked hard! Follow the recipe EXACTLY -- DON'T adjust the proportions and DON'T do what others suggest and just drizzle chocolate over the tops. That's cheating. Dip the WHOLE thing for the best taste and awesome texture.  Just be sure to chill the candies really well before dipping. I can't say enough.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.  
FYI:  For some reason, my second batch did stick to the (well)buttered waxed paper.  I might try dropping them out on a well-greased baking sheet next time.

This was my new favorite for this 2008  holiday season.  I used 14 oz. bag of Kraft caramels and 1-1/4 cup Rice Krispies to perfection.  Also used Non-Stick Reynolds Aluminum Foil alone on my cookie sheet and nothing stuck even remotely.  Used my cookie scoop for a uniform size and got them all on one cookie sheet.  I put the chocolate on the tops and sides only.  This is a definite keeper for years to come.  Thanks a billion!

My friend and I discovered after one batch that we could have basically the same taste without quite as much mess by adding a bag of milk chocolate chips to the mixture and not doing the "dipping" step.  Good cookies!

Awesome Candy!! I am making gift bags of candy and cookies this year and so far this is my favorite candy. I added broken up pretzels as well and they are wonderful in it. They are so easy to make!

Very good, very easy.  I did not use pecans and used the chocolate disks for candy making instead of chocolate chips and shortening.  I found that the caramel/rice krispy mixture spread out on the pan, so, when cooled, I molded each puddle into a semi-round shape and then dipped.  The chocolate was not at all too hot to touch as I had feared it may be.

I made these for the first time last for a bake swap at work today.  Like others, I made the mistake of forgetting to grease the wax paper, but was able to salvage them.  They are YUMMY!  We had the swap at lunch time today, and everybody who tried one said they would be surprised if any of these make it home at the end of the day.  I will definitely be making these again!

Made this for Christmas goodies (unfortunately didnt get around to reviewing it until now lol), but was a great success. Even my annoyingly picky mother loved these! Were very chewy however, so might cut back a bit on the caramel next time- just enough to make them easier to chew. Will make again next year!

I made these tasty treats (18 dozen of them) for a Christmas Cookie Exchange party I was invited to. Not only did the ladies at the party rave about them, but the following week when I saw their families at another Christmas party their hubbies and kids all asked if I had brought more of them!!! I've added this one to my recipe box and will surely be making them again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good!  I forgot to buy the caramels for this and ended up making caramel from scratch.  Definitely needed my asbestos fingers to work the cookie mixture.  Recipe takes a little work, but the results are worth the effort. Just a real fine combination of candy ingredients, chewy, crispy, crunchy, yummy!

A little complicated to keep together, but they were very well-received at holiday parties.  the longer you can refrigerate the filling before dipping it in chocolate, the better it will hold together.  VERY tasty!

I made these for the first time yesterday. I sprayed everything with nonstick spray, even my fingers, for the rolling part, and that worked great! For the chocolate, I couldn't figure out how to dip them completely without getting too much chocolate on them, so I just dipped half and that turned out just fine. They're pretty chewy, but the flavour was great! Have already received requests to make more. :)

Fabulous recipe!  I used a cookie scoop that I sprayed with Pam frequently to drop the candy.  Tastes even better than a 100 Grand bar. This is definitely a keeper!

I'd rate this a 5 star for easy-ness, and a 4.5 star for taste.  A little to much teeth-stickablity for me, but overall a good tasting treat.  Unfortunately, only a 3 star for eye appeal...they just don't look good on a cookie tray for the holidays.

Made once with chopped almonds as that's what was at hand. Delish. Made again with pecans - equally delish.

LOVED THESE! I made them for friends and family for Christmas and they were a hit! It's all about the carmel in these. I couldn't find the wrapped carmels the second time so used those little carmel balls but the package was a couple ounces less than the wrapped once and it made a huge difference. You gotta use enough carmel or they aren't nearly as good. And make sure it's fresh. I found an out of date bag of wrapped carmels at a discount store (was desperate! LOL) and the candy turned hard as a rock.

Good, but chocolate turned chalky when cooled. Carmel clumps were difficult to dip in the melted chocolate for a "pretty" presentation.

These were awesome.  I tripled the batch for a cookie exchange and they worked great.  However, even though I sprayed the wax paper they still stuck so I switched to plain plastic wrap - definitely the way to go!  They're sticky, but they don't actually stick to the plastic.

This is one of the easiest recipes I've come across and have it come out so yummy!  Hubby couldn't even wait for the chocolate coating, I caught him snitching a piece while cooling in the refrigerator.  I only made what the recipe called for at first just to see how they would turn out.  You definitely need to make lots more! I also experimented and made a batch with cocoa krispies, outstanding, thanks so much!

Oh, my these are good. 

They are a mess, but here's what I did: I heated the caramel and water in the microwave. (I've had a few bad experiences with heating caramel and chocolate on the stovetop.) I mixed in the chopped pecans then dropped them by the teaspoonful onto greased waxed paper. After 10 minutes in the fridge, the caramel was still soft, so I took a nap and came back. The caramel was still soft, so I peeled the caramel mix off one by one and rolled them into a ball. Don't get me wrong, it was messy. After it was in a ball, I dipped it in the melted chocolate mixture (also melted in the microwave) with tongs and dropped it back onto the wax paper. Refrigerated them, and they are heavenly. 

Next time I will probably try and leave the caramel in the bowl that I melted it in, pop it in the fridge, then dip it out with a spoon to form a little ball, dip and drop onto greased wax paper. 

These are well worth the mess! And your fingers taste great when you're all done!

When people taste these their eyes roll back in their heads!  They have everything I love in a candy, but the best reward is the compliments I receive when I serve them.  I have had to make three batches to satisfy all the requests this Christmas for this particular treat.  Greasing the waxed paper is not a step you can skip in the preparation of this candy unless you're fond of bits of paper in your food.  Definitely worth the effort!

These are easy!  Add a little more than the recommended rice krispies to make a little less chewy. Drop by teaspoonful onto prepared waxed paper.  If small enough, you can get 4 dozen. Then, instead of dipping the whole thing in the chocolate, drizzle a little mound on the top.  It looks prettier and is way easier than the dipping.

I thought these were oustanding. They're super easy and what could be better than caramel, nuts, and chocolate? I dipped the bottom half only in chocolate mixture, and drizzled the tops with additional chocolate to give them a pretty, lacey look. This will be added to my list of annual Christmas candy recipes.

These are delicious but I could not get the chocolate to the right consistency by using the choc. chips and shortening. After throwing out my  first batch of chocolate I used about 2 cups of choc. chips and 1/4 of a block of wax and melted it over low heat. This worked perfectly. I used metal tongs for dipping and had no mess.

These are very yummy!  I added them to my holiday cookie trays and I think they'll be a hit.  They aren't the most attractive looking treat, but I'll have to take time to read through the other reviews to see if anyone had any ideas on making them look better.

These are delicious.  Use a cookie scoop sprayed with Pam, spray the wax or parchment paper, and I recommend melting the milk choc. chips in the microwave following Hershey's online instructions.  Oh, and semi-sweet chips were a disaster for me.  

The perfect recipe - simple ingredients with fantastic results.

The candy is awesome- one problem I thought I had "buttered" the wax paper well but the candy still stuck and we got some wax paper with our treat! next time I think I'll just try my cookie racks- unless you have another suggestion. Jeni Pearson- LaPorte In.

I absolutely could not find branches carmel so I went with Carmel balls for the Christmas season from Kraft. Actually, I think this is much prefered because they are small and melt easier. It was only an 11 oz bag, but worked well with the same nuts and crispy. I did however, reduce water to 2 TBS. At first I thought I had too much water and almost added more carmel (from a second bag), but then it seemed to cream out. Mine all fit onto one cookie sheet. I sprayed everything with PAM, the parchment paper, spoon, spatula and used a teflon pan. Everythign was awesome until the chocolate step. I got the chocolate melted pretty quickly, so took the shet out before 10 minutes. I could have coated them, but decided to leave them on the sheet and jut drizzle over. Next time I will use Semi sweet to reduce sweetness a bit. As I worked quickly the chocolate got hard and almost powdery...I tried everything to keep it smooth, but nothing worked. So I ended up clumping chocolate on some and then smearing and pushing it down on them to make smooth. those are definately not as smooth and nice looking, but the taste should be similar. next time I will make two batches of chocolate to lengthen my time to get it on. Also, I only used 1 bag (just over 2 cups) and I had left over. I also only did 1 tsp of shortening. Not really sure what that is for, never did that before. I will make them again, but with the changes I made above. 5 star for taste and ease.

I was looking for something different to make for the holiday season that were a little different than cookies.  These were perfect.  They were deliciously sweet and easy to make.  Great recipe.  I will be making these every Christmas from now on.

I recently made these and they were excellent. The cereal and nuts provided the perfect amount of crunch for the caramel

I make these every Christmas now and my family loves them.  They do get messy quickly and are much better when they are fresh.  No complaints here!
