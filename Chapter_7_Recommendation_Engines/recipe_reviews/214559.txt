GREAT!  I SUGGEST USING 1/2 KILO TO 1 KILO OF PEANUTS AND ADJUSTING THE RECIPE SERVINGS & INGREDIENTS ACCORDINGLY! IT LOOKED LIKE A GROUP OF CHIPMONKS WHEN THE HONEY PEANUTS WERE SERVED EVERYONES CHEEKS WERE STUFFED AND THEY HAD TWO HANDFULS OF PEANUTS - LOOKING TO HIDE SOME FOR LATER! GONE IN A FLASH!  1 KILO = 2.2 LBS.!

I really liked this recipe and I followed every single instruction just as it is, and I didn't have any problem with it being too watery or runny. I guess the other people who tried this recipe didn't let the syrup part of the recipe cook long enough, therefore, the syrup was too liquidy. I cooked mine for about 15-20 minutes but I guess that depends on the heat settings of your stove. The only problem I had isn't really a problem for me, but even after I used the dry salt/sugar mix at the end, the peanuts still stuck together and were very, very sticky. Other than that, though, this recipe was great! Oh, and I also put some ground up cinnamon in the salt/sugar mix that you add in the end :)

The problem with the recipe is the non-specific term "thick and bubbling."  More accurately the syrup should be boiled to the "soft-ball stage" or about 240 degrees F.  This takes longer than the 10 - 15 minute specified in the recipe.  In fact it may take 30 minutes or longer.  Only boiled for 10 - 15 minutes it will indeed be watery/thin and will result in the sticky mess some have experienced.

Admittedly I changed it quite a bit, but it was excellent! I used diabetisweet (sugar substitute) instead of sugar, and sugar free honey. I also used the splenda brown sugar variety, 1/3 cup water, and pecans instead of peanuts. I didn't measure the weight of the nuts, but it may have been as much as 2/3 lb. Very delish!

It was messy, sticky and time consuming waste,  I followed it to a tee.  
Didn't say I couldn't eat it ...  just wouldn't serve it to others.  Taste was fine.

I'm not sure what happened.  These just turned into a sticky runny mess.  The flavor is good but we had to eat them with a spoon even after letting them sit in the fridge.

I made this and love it. I used vegan butter instead of regular butter. I also put it in the oven for about 10 mins to help thicken and crystalize the mixture. Also added some cinnamon and brown sugar to the sugar/salt mixture at the end I put half of the mixture on once I took it out of the oven, and the other half after it cooled. came out absolutely amazing and tastes like Planters honey roasted peanuts (which are my favorite). absolutely love this.
