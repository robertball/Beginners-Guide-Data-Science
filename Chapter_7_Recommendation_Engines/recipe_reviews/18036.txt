This is a great cake and very easy to prepare.  My kids loved it and asked me to make it again. I do think the other reviewer was correct though, this should only be cooked for about 40 minutes.  I sprinkled it with a little icing sugar and had it with my afternoon coffee. Delicious!

Even though it doesn't look good when it comes out of the oven, it really tastes good. I used the fruit cocktail with extra cherries. It was completely baked in 40 minutes which is less than the recipe suggests. I think whipped cream would be a good addition when serving. I will make it again.

This was ok, extremely easy to make and different. I like that it's low in calories. I might make it again if I need something quick.

Tried this recipe this weekend and not only is it very easy, but tasty as well.  My family enjoyed it  and I will certainly be baking this again!  Sprinkling powered sugar on top is a nice addition.

Nothing special, however it was quick and easy.  Probably needs some whipped cream or ice cream on top to make it special.

I always replace the fruit cocktail with thawed frozen fruit to complement whichever cake mix I use. Personally I like devil's food and mixed berries. Not sweet at all but tasty!
