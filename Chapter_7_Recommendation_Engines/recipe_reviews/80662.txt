This was tasty enough but I'm not sure it was worth the work. I have made much better 'from scratch' curries. Please note that you should remove the cloves, cardamons and peppercorns from the sauce. Yes, they soften up, but biting into them unawares is NOT pleasant.

I wanted a kid friendly curry dish that my 3yr old would love.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Lots of spices, but still pretty quick. I made a few changes to suit my needs:  I used ground spices instead of whole, I used 3tbs of brown sugar, cut the pepper in half (which was still too much for my 3 yr old so I'll have to cut back even more) and used coconut milk instead of cream. I also added sliced bell pepper (red, yellow green & orange) to make it a one dish meal.  Served with brown rice. RAVES!! I think this will be our new spagetti...

I love curry, but not this.  It was not the bold curry flavor I was expecting.  It was more of a subtle West Indian curry.  The flavors were not great, only OK.  It actually took a while to make, and the finished product was not worth the time investment.  I would not make it again.

I have been making hot curry for many years - this is one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  I like the whole seeds - it is like a party in your mouth!

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought this was an EXCELLENT recipe.  I used whole spices (and didn't remove them - they added extra flavor in different bites).  I used a little extra of everything, and particularly with the curry - I used 5-6 tbsp of Hot curry.  I did the recipe with chicken thighs, my hubby's preference, and it was awesome.  Serve with basmati rice and/or Nam bread and it would make a great treat!

It was very good. My chicken ended up getting dried out but i think I just let it simmer too long!

We added more salt and lemon juice when we made it here. It was great, a little hotter than I normally like my spices, but still really good. And hey, it can never heart to accustom yourself to even hotter food.  =D

I've been looking for a good curry recipe.  Chicken Korma happens to be my favorite Indian dish and this reminds me of it.  Next time, I'm going to try adding almonds, which should make it even closer.  I added broccoli also to get in my veggies.  I don't know that I would say that it is hot or sour, but it definitely is beautifully fragrant and a nice but not overdone sweet.  You can always adjust to your tastes though.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Nice spice flavors, but WAY. TOO. HOT. It doesn't even need the red pepper flakes; without them, it's a wonderful recipe. I recommend leaving them for addition on an individual eater basis. My mouth is on fire, and not in the nice way :( [I have no problem eating hot/spicy foods at a reasonable level of heat.] Ouch. 3 stars.

boneless skinless thighs, no onion, no cardamom pods, 2Tbs madras curry, 1Tbs hot curry.  Pretty good.  A little too spicy for the kids.  I would make this again.

Fantastic flavour! Instead of cream, to lower fat content I used 1/2 cup skim milk with 1/2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in it to thicken sauce a bit at the end.  Restaurant quality dish!

A very nice blend of flavours and I did keep the whole seeds in as they add to the eating sensation. Did add more Chilli, but that is our taste.
