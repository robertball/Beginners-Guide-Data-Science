Was very Good. Made it with Raspberries without the sweet and sour, and it was just as good as a strawberry daiquiri.  need to have a beefy blender, though. It was very thick.

This recipe is very good as is.  In order to add a little something extra, though, I tried adding a splash each of blackberry brandy and triple sec, and that was excellent.
