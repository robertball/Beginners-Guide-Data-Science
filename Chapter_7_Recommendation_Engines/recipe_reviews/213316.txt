I took this to a cookout and it was a hit.  Instead of using 2 cream of celery soups, I used one celery and one cream of chicken.  I also added 1 cup of sour cream.  I noticed that alot of people picked out the peas so I probably won't use those the next time!

If there were 6 stars, I'd click on that one too. This was so good. I switched the green peas for  broccoli florets and added more bacon. When it was finished cooking, I topped with some more crumbled bacon and shredded cheese.  This recipe would be great to mess with because so many things taste great on a baked potato and I am sure it would be wonderful on the casserole. Good stuff, a keeper.

I made this with the Cream Soup Base recipe instead of canned cream soup. This was delicious AND filling. The whole family of 12 enjoyed it!

Loved this! As it turned out I did not have any hash browns or french fried onions.  I put mini frozen turkey meatballs, tater tots, frozen green peas, and frozen green beans as the bottom layer in the casserole.  Then I crumbled the bacon and scattered the cheese for the next layer.  For the top layer I sauteed: 1 small onion, 2 celery ribs, 4 garlic cloves and one 4 oz can mushroom pieces in olive oil until tender.  Add one can cream of mushroom soup, one can cream of celery soup and 1 cup milk.  Pour soup mixture over top and bake until bubbly in center, about 50 to 60 minutes.  Everyone in the household loved this one dish meal!

I absolutely loved this dish!! I did a whole package of bacon b/c I love meat, and I added sour cream to the soup mixture! I also skipped the peas b/c i don't like them! It was extremely creamy and delishous!!

Turn out very nicely. I only had one can of soup, so I did a can of soup with a can of milk and poured it over the top. I thought it would be dry, but it was nice and soft without being mushy. Also, after 30 min of cooking, I stirred it a bit, put on the onions, another cup of cheese and baked it until the rest of the food was done.

This was good but didn't get the "can you make this again soon" from my guy. I'm just a bit let down...maybe it was a texture thing for him. This had good flavor and was a nice change up for a side dish. Also, still not so sure about the peas in it, I used them but they seemed a little out of place. Maybe next time I'll leave those out and up the bacon.

I wanted a complete meal, so I added corn and diced chicken (pre-cooked). I also used Cream of Chicken soup instead and omitted the bacon. It was great, everyone loved it. I only gave it 4 stars because it is just such a "heavy" dinner. I doubled the recipe and have an extra casserole in the freezer.
