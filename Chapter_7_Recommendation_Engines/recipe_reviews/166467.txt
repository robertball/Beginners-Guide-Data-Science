This is a wonderful way to serve vegetables!  Roasting vegetables gives them a nutty flavor that just can't be had steaming or boiling.  I kept the ingredients and amounts the same however I changed the order of things.  Drizzel vegetables with olive oil first and toss to coat, then spinkle with the rest of seasonings and toss again.  They get coated much more evenly this way.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This a great way to roast vegetables. I marked this down one star because of the amount of Montreal seasoning.   I used chili flakes instead of the chili powder.  Less Montreal seasoning & fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Very easy and tasty.

If I was to review this recipe strictly as written, it would deserve far less than four stars.  In my opinion, the chili powder alone, let alone the sheer volume of it and combining it with the Montreal Steak Seasoning, would be incompatible and, frankly, inedible.  I mean, it just doesn’t belong.  However....omit the chili powder altogether, toss the vegetables (I added some grape tomatoes) with olive oil and the Montreal Steak Seasoning TO TASTE, add a little chicken broth so this doesn't turn out dried up, crispy and foul, and we've got something here.  Delicious.

I like to roast vegetables, but I never used broccoli as I thought it would not come out well. When I saw this recipe, I tried it and WOW it was great. Hoever, I did not use the steak seasoning or other spices. I added onions, red pepper, mushrooms and whole garlic cloves, and seasoned with sea salt and freshly grated black pepper. I mixed the roased veggies with pasta and it was yummy!!!

I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies! This was so good, my husband and I went back for seconds. He thought I used butter because the flavor was so yummy! I will make this at least once or twice a week!

pretty good broccoli, although the amount of seasoning is a bit too much. has some heat to it, which i like. i didn't have montreal steak seasoning and so i found a recipe for it online: 1/4 tsp garlic powder,  1/2 tsp ground coriander seed,  1/4 tsp sea salt,  1/2 tsp dill weed,  1/2 tsp paprika,  1/2 tsp crushed red pepper,  1/2 tsp black pepper (this makes the 1 Tbl Montreal called for in the recipe). i drizzled the olive oil on the broccoli first, as recommended by other reviewers, then sprinkled with all the seasonings and tossed to coat (i added no extra salt or pepper). i baked for the full 20, but will only do 15 next time. thx for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This has become my go-to broccoli recipe, in fact, it has become my go-to roasted vegetable recipe. I just switch out the broccoli and pepper for whatever veg I'm roasting. Thanks for sharing.

Don't need to add salt with the Montreal steak seasoning, and would recommend only 1/2 T. of that.

I will definitely have this again. It did have a bit too much spice. Next time I'll cut the Montreal steak seasoning in half and possibly eliminate the chili powder for my wife.  I think I'll add cauliflower too.

The combination of spices on these veggies was very good, but there was simply too much spice, and I like spice. I wanted to "go with my gut" when I made these and cut the spices back. Next time I will cut back. Thanks for a tasty recipe.

I usually just steam my broccoli so this was a nice change.  The steak seasoning was great tasting with the broccoli - quick and tasty!

If hubby enjoys eating his broccoli, it's a good way to make it!!!  This is similar to Rachel Ray's Chili-Garlic Roasted Broccoli recipe I've been using for 8 or so years now.  The difference is Rachel's uses fresh garlic, not powdered, and this one calls for bell peppers. That said, using garlic powder as opposed to the fresh garlic eliminated the little pieces of burnt garlic stuck to the broccoli, and the addition of sweet bell peppers was quite nice.  Oh, and I use Roasted Garlic & Herb Grill-mate, not Montreal Steak (personal preference).  Thank you, thank you for a new twist on an old favorite!!!  This is a must-try side dish!

WAY too much spice. The flavor wasn't bad if there was like 1/10 of the spice but nothing great either.

I love roasting vegetables, so I was surprised when this one didn't impress us.  I used less than half the amount of Montreal steak seasoning, omitted the chili powder, used fresh garlic, and subbed red pepper for the yellow.  I roasted for the specified time and thought the result was a little dried out, tough and chewy.

This is now a staple in our home. The recipe can be a bit salty and bitter. I recommend using low-sodium Montreal steak seasoning and making sure the garlic powder is evenly distributed.

I really liked this.  I'm watching my weight right now.  It was a change from plain steamed broccoli and didn't require cheese.  I would rather have my broccoli cooked this way than any other way that I have tried.

This looked pretty and sounded good. Too bad it wasn't. The chili powder was just weird with the veggies. Something just didn't go. Thanks anyway, it was fun trying out a new dish.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't measure the broccoli and I know I had much more than 2 cups. Also, I forgot the yellow pepper. I read many reviews and decided to cut the amounts of the seasoning down a little. I disagree with other reviewers that felt the chili powder "just didn't belong" It was a wonderful combination of spices. I would just cut the spices in half and try it out. I also drizzled the broccoli with the olive oil, then mixed the spices together, then mixed in really well with the broccoli. Yum!

The steak seasoning and Chili powder,  in the given proportions,  was overwhelming.   If I make it again,  I'll drastically reduce the proportions,  and probably just stick with the Montreal seasoning.   15 minutes was also too long.

I love it on meat, but I found the steak seasoning too salty for vegetables. I'm using the concept of roasting seasoned veggies with olive oil in many combinations now and love that it's a quick and easy way to make a healthy side dish whenever I'm using the oven for a main dish. Cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, onions, and blood-orange-infused grapeseed oil is my current favorite. Thanks for the basic idea!

As much as I like Montreal Seasoning, I think this had just a tad too much.  It was good and we all enjoyed it, however.  I didn't have regular chili powder, only Mexican chili powder.  will make this again as we all enjoyed this for a change.

Delicious! I did not use the steak seasoning, but it still tasted delicious. When it came out of the oven I drizzled balsamic vinaigrette over the broccoli to bring out even more flavor.

This was inedible to me.  It was ridiculously salty with only a pinch of salt added.  I used twice as much broccoli as the recipe called for and the seasoning was still way too strong.

I liked this a lot.  I only had Spicy Montreal seasoning and I only used a 1/2 TBS and that was pretty spicy.  I will make this recipe again.

This was a great recipe! The only thing I would change is the amount of chili powder. I like spicy food, but the chili powder seemed to overpower the steak and garlic seasoning. I would recommend 1 tsp. or less of chili powder and upping the amount of garlic. We used frozen veggies w/the peppers and it turned out great!

I am always trying to find new ways to give my family their daily dose of vegetables. I followed others advice about the overspicing and didn't use steak seasoning or chili powder at all. Instead I used black pepper and my favorite garlic salt. It was very good and had a great texture.

I really just thought this tasted kind of weird.  Maybe it's just not a flavor I've become accustomed to -- but I wouldn't make this again.  I too cut back on the seasonings but it still really wasn't what I wanted.  I guess I'll stick to plain steaming or lemon juice :) Sorry for the poor review -- at least everyone else liked it ;D

Very good but like others have stated, way to much seasoning. Used mini bell peppers that i sliced into rings. Will make again-just reduce the seasoning by half.

My broccoli was way too salty and too spicy for me. I even had 4 cups broccoli. I don't think I will be making this again. Just didn't care for the combination of everything. Sorry.

A great zesty and tasty veggie dish. I used hot chili powder, so that and the Montreal steak seasoning gave it a extra spicy kick.  Next time I will make it with mild chili to make it more kid-tolerable.

I used 2 teaspoons of Montreal steak seasoning on about 4 cups of broccoli. 1 tablespoon on 2 cups would have been too salty/spicy. I usally like roasted broccoli. The seasoning were a nice addition and would probably be pretty tasty on roasted cauliflower too. Looking back at the recipe I see I totally forgot to add the red peppers.

This was fantastic! I used frozen broccoli and frozen bell pepper medley, didn't have the seasoning but tossed the veggies with EVOO, chili pepper and garlic salt. I will definitely be making this again, and experimenting with veggie combinations.

This was a really pleasant mix of veggies to roast. Didn't have steak seasoning in the house so I used a 1:1 blend of Italian and Cajun seasoning mix, and it was pretty good! I personally leave them in the oven long enough to get good and brown, with a crunchy bottom, mmmm. Thanks for sharing :)

Very good.  I don't like eating veggies, particularly broccoli, but this was great.  I made the mistake of using SPICY Montreal steak seasoning.  I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like spicy things.  Yea for broccoli!

Was pretty excited about this dish, as I was looking for a different way to cook broccoli other then just steaming. However, my fiance and I couldnt eat it. It was way too salty!!! Next time Ill cut way back, if not at all of the montreal steak seasoning and salt. It has potential and will try it again.

Like usual, I use recipes as a base or an idea. Broccoli florets with garlic and cayanne powders and a little sea salt tossed in olive oil then roasted for 20 or so minutes. Delicious and I use it in so many different things. I'll add some to my risotto, use in my fried rice, lo mein, stir-fry, pasta with alfredo. I love it.

I've made this recipe three times now, and each time it has turned out great.  Tonight, I made Peri-Peri Pork Roast with this as the side dish... I used the Peri-Peri seasoning instead of the Montreal Steak seasoning.... it was delicious... so the bones of this recipe are very good, and it is easy to adjust to your own taste.  Five Stars!!!

Good recipe for roasted vegetables, I drizzled a little more oil at the end because the broccoli takes longer than the other veggies to cook. Tasted great.

Flavorful but a little salty. If you're looking for a low sodium recipe, this is not the one for you. Also, I cooked for only 15 minutes to maintain a little of the broccoli's body - 20 minutes would've been too long.

This came out super salty.  The flavor was good, but there was too much of the Montreal for us.   Next time I'll cut that part in half.

It's a good recipe .

Changes I made: I skipped the salt and pepper.  In my opinion, with the use of Montreal Steak Spice, they're not needed.

The roasting time is perfect, my husband snarfed it all down.  I'll be making this one again.

Very easy.  I agree with the previous writer regarding adding a little chicken  broth.  I cooked for about 10 minutes at 400degrees.

I've been kinda fixated on the idea of roasted broccoli lately so I decided this was the perfect recipe to serve as a dipper with our first ever at home fondue night.  It was just the right amount of crispy and savory that paired so well with the rich cheese.

Great base recipe on which to make my own variations (chopped fresh ginger instead of steak seasoning) -- the time and temperature recommendations are what I most needed to know. TIP: if you make too much, like I did, chop the leftovers and add to a cream soup base (flour, butter, milk) along with some cheese. It made a soup so good I'm almost ready to roast broccoli just to make it again.

Great recipe, didn't have chili powder, used chipotle chili pepper instead. Also added an orange pepper and left out the salt and pepper. You can change this up with whatever you like.

I used less Montréal steak seasoning, just a little chili powder and omitted the other seasonings.  I used red bell peppers instead of yellow.  I love it and will definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful way to cook broccoli.  I 'eyeballed' the spices because a lot of the reviewers said the recipe called for too much Montreal seasoning.  Threw the spices and EVOO into a gallon size bag, mixed it up, and tossed the broccoli in the bag to coat.  Cooked as directed in the recipe.  It was wonderful, and seems to be a healthier way to cook vegees rather than boiling them.  Great recipe!

I definitely like this way of cooking broccoli. This just needs a few tweaks. This recipe has way to much seasoning. Next time I am going to cut all the seasoning in half and double the olive oil. Also I'm only going to bake it for 15 minutes.

I tossed it with some garlic powder and olive oil, then I covered it with Italian shredded cheese and put it in the oven. came out great. kids and hubby loved it. A little more ingredients would've made it a 5 star.

We liked this baked broccoli but like many others I couldn't resist making a few changes - in particular I replaced the montreal steak spice with a roasted red pepper and garlic seasoning. Turned out quite good. Will definitely make again.

I love this seasoning. I prefer my broccoli and pepper to not be as dry as they are when they come out of the oven. So I've started to boil the broccoli first, and then sauté both the broccoli and the yellow pepper with the seasoning.

Very easy veggie recipe although the broccoli seemed to take too long to get tender and I ended up burning it a little. I think next time I will slightly steam the broccoli first to get it just a bit softer before putting it in the oven

Out of this world!  So easy and it is hard to believe it can be that good.

I made this for the first time today. I thought it was good, although it was far too spicy for my taste. I will make it again, but next time i will use 1 tsp. chili powder instead.

I'm with many of the other reviewers. I was excited to try a new take on broccoli, but this spice combo is a) weird, and b) overpowering. I doubled the recipe because I was so sure I would like it... now I have a fridge full of over-salty broccoli.
Note: the bell pepper tasted much better with these spices than the broccoli did. If I were to make this recipe again (I won't), I would use bell pepper only, and I would halve the Montreal seasoning.

I really enjoyed this way of making broccoli.  Sometimes I forget that you can do other things with it besides just steam it!  The seasonings were great...loved the kick that the cayenne pepper gave it! We love Montreal Steak seasoning ( I season my roast potatoes with it all of  the time)  so when I came across this recipe, I knew it had to be good!

As others said, salty, salty, salty (depending on your taste, I guess) and I put NO extra salt in it.  Next time I will also halve the Montreal steak seasoning for that reason.  Seems like this would always be a very dependable recipe.  Roasted the veggies (used red pepper) and they came out perfectly crisp-tender.  Thank you!

I made this as my vegetable contribution to Thanksgiving dinner, it was loved by everyone and devoured. I made the Montreal Steak Seasoning myself. An easy and delicious recipe, I will make it often.

We loved this recipe!  We like broccoli and I was searching for some variations to the usual steamed variety when I found this recipe.  We like garlic and spicey, so I added 4 cloves chopped fresh garlic and approx 1 Tsp crushed pepper flakes.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe "as is" and agree with the others about the saltiness; however, we loved the spicy taste! Will cut the steak seasoning in half in the future.
