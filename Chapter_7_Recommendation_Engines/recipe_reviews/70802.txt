*Revised* Note: vegetables should be roasted at 400 degrees, not 350 (no preboiling - it saps flavor and prevents carmelization). Because of the different cooking temperatures, I roast the veggies and chicken separately. (If you only have 1 oven, preroast the veggies first, set them aside, and then cook the chicken.  When chicken is done, let it rest under foil, increase the oven temp, and finish roasting veggies.  That way, by the time the juices have settled back in the chicken, the veggies are hot and done.)  I find that adding a little water to the glaze SIGNIFICANTLY improves the color and texture.  Otherwise it will be too thick when cooked.  Also, to avoid burning the glaze, pour over chicken 15 minutes before the timer ends instead of 20 min.  You'll definitely want to make extra sauce to serve on the side.

I adapted this for a crock pot - I just placed the veggies on bottom, then the chicken on top, and then I poured the sauce on top. It was great - soft and flavorful!

The taste of this dish is EXCELLENT, and we don't usually like curry! I was amazed!

On the downside, the chicken took much longer to cook than the given time of 1hr 20 min. Our 3.5lb chicken took a bit over 2 hours, at 350! Next time around, I will add the veggies in at the same time as I start cooking the chicken, because they also took a much longer time to "brown" with the glaze (I had to broil for a few minutes). I would still add the glaze in at the last 20 min, to avoid burning. I will also SKIP parboiling the potatoes and carrots, as they never really carmelized by boiling and then roasting. But, the dish was still fantastic!

I doubled the sauce and put half the sauce over a 7 lb chicken in a slow cooker all day and the other half over cut up potatoes, carrots, portobello mushrooms and onions in the refrigerator to marinate all day.  I cooked the veggies at 400 for an hour, roasted some asparagus in the last 12 minutes of that and we had a great meal.  The chicken was falling off the bone after 8 hours in the slow cooker.  Oh, I only used 2 T butter in the doubled sauce recipe. Yum.

Had this last night and LOVED it! Very tasty and fairly quick too! Moderate changes: I used cut up chicken pieces, sprinkled with Johnny's seasoning and pepper & bit of Olive oil. Baked the chicken at 400* for 15 mins, turned down to 350* for 30 mins. Meanwhile I cooked the sauce which I doubled, cut back on honey a bit, added more garlic. Microwaved only the carrots & potatoes until tender but still crisp. Dumped all veggies around the chicken as stated, poured on the sauce over all, baked 15 minutes more to carmelize sauce! The chicken cut up cooks quicker than the whole bird. Total time baking was 1 hour. Served with Jasmine rice with the yummy sauce on top! YUMMY!

I doubled the sauce as many have suggested... ran out of Dijon mustard, substituted with spicy Brown Mustard... also added a cup of eggplant chopped and zucchini that was left over from another... DELISH!!!

This recipe was good. I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken.  I think chicken thighs taste wonderful when done in the oven, better than breast (probably due to the higher fat content).  I put the veggies in the microwave (in a covered corning ware with a splash of water) for 8min; this is a good trick! They come out as if they are steamed (much quicker than boiling for 20min and you don't loose all the nutrients in the boiling water).  The mushrooms tasted particularly great.  The sauce smells great while on the stove.  However when everything was done, my husband and I thought it was too sweet, next time I will use 1/2 to 2/3 of the honey.  I didn't use apples because I was skeptical, but I could see they would go very well, will try next time.

Fantastic!  I was a little skeptical at first, as the sauce just seemed...wierd.  It was absolutely incredible, though.  I made it exactly per the recipe and I will certainly make it again.  I'm already scheming up other ways to use the sauce!

This was delicious-- I was out of dijon mustard, so I had to use spicy brown and it worked great. I also had to sub 1 tsp. of onion powder, and did only 1/4 tsp. of salt. Instead of a whole chicken, I did about 1.5 lbs. of chicken breasts cut into strips. However, I still did the full amount of sauce, poured it over the chicken in a 7x11 glass dish, and baked in a 375 degree oven for just over an hour. Served it with the extra sauce over mashed potatoes and it was perfect. My husband said it was one of his favorite ways I make chicken, and even my 3 year old with a cold (thus lowered appetite) cleared off a big portion.

This was one of the best chicken meals I have ever eaten! Just made it for dinner with friends and everyone loved it. The sauce is absolutely amazing with the combination of flavours. My changes were to put in enough potatoes so that it didn't need rice on the side. Also made it with chicken wings and legs instead of whole bird and even like this it almost needed 2 hours total cooking time. Well worth every minute though!

Quick Alternative- I just quickly browned a pound of chicken tenders in olive oil in a skillet and then added 1/2 cup chicken broth and all the remaining ingredients (substituted dried chopped onion and garlic powder, and omitted the potatoes)  Simmer for 20 minutes and serve over rice -Great dish.

This is so good!! I found that using chicken theighs instead of the whole chicken is best. Also, cook the vegs seperately because they get over cooked.

Love this recipe! I make it very often, my dh, who wasn't sure at first if he would like curry, has now claimed this as one of his favorite dinners. I throw in all sorts of vegetables and the honey-curry combo is devine with tomatoes, potatoes carrots, and celery. MMmmmm

This is definitely the best roasted chicken dish I've ever had! Because I didn't want to dirty another pot, I just threw the potatoes and carrots in with the chicken from the beginning. I also added a cut up sweet potato at this time, which I thought went very nice with the finished dish. I used a three pound chicken and found both the cooking time and the amount of sauce to be perfect.

FANTASTIC - thank you! I made this in my crockpot, too, and it was great. Threw in the raw veggies, put some raw chicken on top and poured the sauce over it all. Cooked it on high for 2 hours. For the sauce, I doubled all ingredients except the honey. It turned out like a stew, so we ate it in a bowl over basmati rice. Easy and wonderful!

Wow!!! This chicken was so incredibly tasty!  I did not have mushrooms on hand, but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and I was not disappointed. The flavor was superb and the chicken moist. It even made the house smell great! This one is definitely a keeper. YUM!

WOW - what a great recipe! My changes: I used bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. Instead of baking it plain, I coated them with "A Taste of Thai" spicy peanut chicken coating mix which comes 2 envelopes per box. I Added 1 Tbs curry powder to each envelope of coating, shook the chicken pieces in the mixture and baked. I doubled the honey-curry sauce mix recipe, but only used 3 Tbs butter as 6 seemed way too much. I added sweet potatoes in addition to the carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and apples. My family went nuts - they loved this recipe!

Very good!  Omitted the veggies and just did the chicken and potatos, but didn't peel the redskins first.  Just parboiled them whole, then cut them and roasted with the chicken.  The glaze carmelized nicely with good flavor.  Everything was delish!  Made the "Green Bean Stew" from this site as a side and it went together well.

I used a 4 lb chicken which took a little over three hours to cook.  I placed the veggies minus the shrooms with the chicken the whole time (no preboiling) and they cooked great.  I added the mushrooms at the last 20 minutes with the sauce, which I doubled.  The sauce seemed a little too thick, so next time I'm going to use honey mustard in replace of the honey (as honey is kinda pricey anyway) and maybe just a 1/3 cup of dijon for flavor.

Fabulous blend of flavors.  A great fall meal.  I roasted the chicken upside down with garlic, apples and onions inside the body and then fliped the bird breast side up and added the more apples,  and onions as well as sweet potatoes, and red potatoes, and then I poured the glaze over everything.  I did not boil the veggies first like the recipe said and everything turned out beautifully.  I also like this dish because you can roast the chicken and prep the veggies ahead of time.

This was one of the best recipes I've tried from here. It was easy and flavorful. I will make it again, maybe adding more curry powder but thats about the only thing I'd do different. If you like curry you gotta try this dish.

Wonderful recipe!  This is great for people who like that curry flavor but not the spice!  Like many have said there is no way you can roast your chicken at 350--I used the roasting recipe for the Rapid Roast chicken recipe found on this site where you do 20 min at 450 and then forty at 400.  That will get the job done quickly and at the right temps.  Despite the incorrect cooking info, when you actually get it cooked, it is amazing!

These flavors are awesome! My changes are as follows: increase oven temperature from 350 degrees to 375 degrees F, drain all but 2 tbsp. of drippings from pan before adding the honey-curry mixture, making a little more sauce to cover all the vegetables, and increasing total cook time (4 lb bird takes 2 hours). Next time, I will flip bird over so the breasts are on top and throw a root vegetable or citrus fruit in the cavity of chicken to moisten the meat. Rave reviews from this household! Thank you for the recipe!

I cooked my chicken in the crockpot all day. Then I put it in the oven with the veggies and sauce for 30 minutes at 350. Yummy! Omitted the apples and mushrooms since I didn't have them on hand. I used only 1/3 c. of honey and it was plenty sweet.

I really liked this recipe.  The apple and mushrooms went so well with the sauce. My husband said "Is it Thanksgiving again?" The aroma was so wonderful.  I served a dollup of sour cream on the side of the vegis to tame the sweetness. I also left out the step of par boiling. I just roasted the potatos and carrots along with the bird and then added the apple and mushrooms when I applied the sauce. Sooo tastey.

If you like curry this is the recipe for you! It's very good. The sauce is fabulous! I served it with rice and loved every single bite. Afterwards I boiled the frame and picked off the remaining meat for a curry flavored chicken soup. I am already scheming to make this again very soon! I liked the chicken soup even more than the original dish! I included the leftover sauce in the soup broth and it was great. I recommend this dish highly.

Wonderful!  The only things I did different were to salt/pepper/garlic powder the outside of the chicken and stuff with apple/lime/onion.  Think I'll try it next time in the crock pot.

Looking for a honey curry chicken recipe...misplaced my old one.  This was outstanding! I used leg quarters ( I remember the white meat getting dry in my old recipe)and roasted them for 20 minutes skin side down while boiling the carrots and potatoes.  Cut the honey and the butter in half and added a couple TBSP of water, but kept everything else in the sauce the same.  Flipped the chicken and added the veggies (could have doubled the mushrooms)and poured the sauce over all. Baked for another 35-40 minutes.  Delish! Finger licking sauce, thanks for the great recipe.

Definately would have been too sweet with all the honey. For Veggies I added zucchinni and yellow squash and red peppers along with the potatoes and carrots. It's a great combination of tastes.

Delicious and easy to make - gotta love that. I think I'll cut back on the honey a little next time because it was a bit sweet for my husband and me. My kids loved it the way it is.

Loved this dish.  The only change I did was instead of boiling/steaming the veggies I put them around the chicken right from the start.  Was only able to make 1/2 the sauce as I only had 1/3 cup of honey so put on top of the chicken.  Will be making again.

Made this for a potluck for around 50 people, it was gone in 15 mins! I used chicken drumsticks, thighs and cut up chicken breasts. I found the drumsticks didn't go over as well as the chicken thighs and breasts. I doubled the sauce and used slightly less honey as others have suggested. The veggies took forever even at 400 degrees finally after an hour and a half, I turned the oven up to 450 degrees because at this point I was running late. Overall,I would make this again but I would allow extra time for the veggies.

Absolutely love this recipe! Its become a favorite in our household. I use fresh ginger instead of ground and I use 3-4 cloves of garlic. (I double the garlic in pretty much anything I make!) I also throw my potatoes, apples, onions, mushrooms or whatever veggies I have into the same roaster at the same time as the chicken. I take off the lid and broil for a couple minutes before taking out just to get the skin all nice and crispy. Nothing is overcooked and its delicious! Faster and easier!

This was very good, but I didn't like the apples - too mushy. Next time I think I would add some peas. I used canola oil instead of butter. I put the veggies in a crock pot, the chicken on top, and sauce on top of the chicken. I cooked in on high for 1 hour, then medium for about 6 hours, then low for the last hour. DELICIOUS!

I tried this in the crock pot and it totally dissolved into mush, but tasty mush. I would like to try it in the oven where it might be a more intact meal instead of a stew with bones in it

I roasted my veggies in a separate small roaster with some garlic, salt and pepper, and a splash of chicken stock @ 400 for about 40 minutes give or take. I just poured half the curry sauce over each about 10-15 minutes before the chicken was finished. The chicken was moist, juicy and tender. Ummmm good. There will def be a next time although I want to add a little coconut milk to the sauce. MMMMMMMM good

My family loved this dish.  It was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy.  I didn't boil the veggies, just threw them in after the chicken was cooking for an hour.  I will be making this again soon! Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This was great.  I used boneless skinless breast and cooked the veggies with it instead of boiling them (all on 400 degrees for 45 minutes before adding the next step ingredients as listed in original recipe.) I also added a can of asparagus (drained) when the mushrooms and apples go in. It turned out fantastic. The apples were the best part of all.

This was great! I put a mixture of lime juice, crushed garlic, salt and pepper and a couple teaspoons of curry under the skin and inside the chicken. Also put the leftover lime skins in the cavity, which really helps to keep it moist. I used yam, potato, carrot, mushroom, apple, and a bit of asparagus. Tossed the veg in olive oil, salt, and pepper and roasted at 400 degrees in a separate pan as suggested by another reviewer. It was getting late, so I popped the chicken in at 400, not long after the veggies. When the chicken reached about 140 degrees, I took both pans out of the oven. I put some sauce on the veggies, put the chicken on top of the veggies (breast down, but I think I would flip it to breast up next time), and coated everything with the rest of the sauce. I turned the heat down to 350, and cooked the bird and veggies until the chicken reached 180 degrees. I let it sit for 10 minutes and carved it. I was able to serve the veggies right out of the pan I cooked them in. My kids ate every bit of moist, flavorful meat on a 4-pound bird. I put the carcass, leftover veg, and sauce into a pot of water for soup. I'm betting it will be great broth for a Mulligatawny soup. With the 400-degree roasting, both the chicken and veg were perfect, and done in less time than I expected.

This is by far the best whole chicken recipe I've ever tasted. I had to make a couple of adjustments based on what I had on hand. I subbed a small can of apple sauce for the fresh ones and curry paste instead of powder, which I rubbed all over the chicken before pouring the sauce over top. I made this in the crock pot and it turned out excellent. Thank-you for the wonderful recipe!

I used frozen chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken - cuts the cooking time in half.  My husband made me promise to make this again and again - he raved about it all the way through dinner.  A "keeper".

Way to sweet for me, and I only added half the honey the recipe called for.  I enjoyed it, hence the 4 stars, but won't make it again and it didn't make good leftovers.  If you like sweet dinners, this is for you.

This is a great and easy dish. I add one can of coconut milk to the sauce, pour it over cut up chunks of boneless skinless chicken breasts and bake it at 375 for 45 minutes. But the milk makes extra sauce so the first time I added it to rice and my kids devoured it. This time I'm boiling potatos and carrots in it. I'll take the extra from the chicken and add it to the rice.

I made this basically according to recipe, I did however do as others who have reviewed this, doubled the sauce. I also brined my chicken the day before I cooked it. I decided to use just one apple and i cored it and quartered it and placed it in the chicken cavity, it kept it moist and gave it a great flavor. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder under the skin and on top as well. I also roasted my vegies at 400 degrees for 15 minutes before hand and then roasted my chicken separately in a 400 degree oven for 30 min then lowered the temp to 350. I put the sauce on the chicken in the last 10 min of cooking and then took out chicken covered  in foil to rest. I popped the vegies back in the oven at 400 degrees to finish and also slathered sauce on them. Every one loved this. I also think that this would be excellent with pork.

Curious ... does the recipe actually call for Red Pepper flakes (as ingredients list shows) or Cayenne Pepper (as referenced in the directions)? Overall, great dish. Boyfriend LOVED this, but I felt the flavor of Mustard and Honey overwhelmed any hint of Curry. Will try again. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing! Although I think the taste of the apples could've been better if I tried using something other than a Fuji Apple, also if I had a bigger roasting pan. But overall, the chicken was moist, the sauce delicious, and great with rice

Wonderful!  I messed with the sauce ingredient amounts a little to suit me, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway.  Great combination of flavors!

I prepared this for a gathering of family & friends and it was a huge hit!  I also used the sauce on some baked salmon last night for dinner along with a green salad and roasted asparagus.  My husband and 8-year old son loved it on the salmon also.  Highly recommend it!

It was really good...completely different than anything that I've cooked. It was my first attempt with curry and  I liked it. I did do things a little differently. I used celery and onions instead of mushrooms...Roasted everything at 400 for for an hour with about 1/2 c. of water...glazing every 5-10 minutes the last 20 minutes. It was good. I served with a little home made garlic bread and it was a hit. (I rated 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I like all the preboiling and adding veggies later was a little too much) Other than that I will DEFINITELY make again.

This was so delicious!  I followed the one reviewer who simply oven roasted the veggies first, set aside and roasted the chicken then the last 20 minutes tossed it all together in the oven with the glaze then served.  It's true, you will want to double the glaze and the veggies because they are so incredable please note I omitted the onion and just used garlic powder because I was feeling lazy but it didn't affect the outcome as far as I'm concerned.  Hubby couldn't stop praising this one, its a keeper for sure.

I did this in a slow cooker with chicken breasts, we don't like brown meat! I cooked the sauce in a sauce pan first and then put the veggies down first with the chicken on top and covered in sauce. It turned out very saucy and yummy. My kids weren't in love with the sauce, but I think curry can be an acquired taste. My husband, mom and I loved it!

My first roasted chicken and it was so very good! I added a half a cup of water to the sauce before putting it over the chicken. We all had plenty of sauce to pour over our plates. My chicken took a lot longer to cook through- 2 hours total.

Made this Sunday for me & the hubby. If you're looking for a spin on the standard roasted chicken --make this one!! I did as others suggested by roasting the veggies first and then the chicken, adding the veggies after draining the chicken juices 10 minutes before the chicken was ready (at the same time adding the glaze). Had GREAT flavor. Thanks!

Wow... this was SOOOO AWESOME!! I did as a previous reviewer did and put the veggies in uncooked about 1/2 way thru. I did not use mushrooms but i did use apples, which I highly recommend!! I also covered my chicken for the first half with foil. This recipe is so great, I think everyone should definitely try it!!! :)

This was fantastic!  I followed other's suggestion to roast the veggies first.  I waited until I added the roasted veggies to the chicken to add the mushrooms and the apples.  Poured the glaze over all of it and put it back in the oven.  OMG!  I wold serve this to guests anyday!

Great recipe, whole family loved it. Mods: Baked the chicken, covered, in a little water for an hour, added raw veggies (potato, carrot, squash) and baked another hour, drained and added boiled sauce and apples and baked uncovered another 1/2 hour.
Great flavour and easy to make! Plus there's broth leftover for another meal later.

this was soooo good!!  i took someone's advice and roasted the vegetables at 400 for 15 minutes and then put the chicken in and reduced temp. to 350 for one hour, then put the sauce on the chicken and vegetables.  the vegetables came out so deliciously carmelized and the apples added a nice sweetness.  the spices were just right.  next time i think i would add more vegetables and double the sauce. i didn't use mushrooms. this is really an excellent recipe!

This recipe gave me lots of trouble. I am not sure if anyone has noticed, but the amount of cayenne pepper listed in the recipe is not in the ingredient list. I went ahead and added 1/4 tsp. Maybe the red pepper flakes and the cayenne pepper were meant to be one and the same? Anyway, that is just one complaint that I had with this...the other being that it took alot longer to cook than stated. The flavors were very good together, kind of a spicy sweetness. My husband didn't really like it and only ate a little.

I changed this recipe to fit our schedule. I mix the sauce ingredients together and pour them over a chicken, potatoes, carrots and onions in the slow cooker. It makes a really nice dinner for a cold day and it doesn't take much time to prepare. We really enjoy it this way.

This is the best chicken ever made. My husband would not stop saying, "Wow!  Wow... Wow!" with every bite! I used Gulden's spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon mustard. It gave a nice kick. Besides that, I followed the directions exactly. Most definitely a keeper!

I liked this recipe fair enough when made verbatim. My husband however hates it when made with the full amount of Dijon. But when I use a dijon-mayonnaise with a little extra crushed pepper to make up for the loss of spice, neither of us can get enough of it! I prefer to boil the vegetables, spread them out in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, then place chicken tenders on top and spoon the sauce over it all and bake for about twenty minutes. When made with these variations, I would give it a 10 if I could. I have also used it to make a fabulous chicken soup.

This is probably the best recipe I have tried on here. I didn't have any curry so I used turmeric, coriander, and a little extra ginger. This was even better the next day! I absolutely loved this dish and will make it often! This is a great way to use up vegetables!

This recipe was delicious. To cut down on cooking time, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into large pieces. I also used both white potatoes and sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes worked really nicely with the sauce. I got a lot of compliments. Thanks!

This was excellent!!!  My husband is not a fan of curry so I substituuted cilantro instead and it was excellent!  I also added some balsamic vinegar to the sauce because I thought it was too sweet at first.  I also used chicken breasts which speeded up the cook time - I browned them in a frying pan and then put them in the baking dish - then I poured the sauce over the chicken breasts and veggies and baked it all for about 10-15 minutes.

Awesome...this was so good.  I basically followed the recipe exactly.  I did double the sauce because I added extra veggies.  Everyone enjoyed it!

I reserve 5 stars for resturant quality, but this was really quite good.  We thickened the sauce on the stove with a little corn starch.  yum!  Everything was great.  Didn't change a thing.

Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. I would never have tried this recipe (am not a fan of sweet stuff on meat) but my hubby was cooking dinner and found this recipe. I am SO glad he did because it will be a new favorite in our house. I love curry, but for those who aren't big curry fans, the flavor is mild.

Very good chicken recipe.  I stuffed the chicken with lemon, oranges, and garlic to kick up the flavor a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was OK, but I thought the chicken didn't have much flavor inside. Perhaps rubbing some seasoning inside the cavity would help.

My family loved this. A wonderful dinner with a great variety of ingredients. I didn't think I would like the combination of mushrooms with apples, but it was actually quite delicious.  The recipe is a bit time consuming but was worth it. The honey mustard sauce is divine.  A tasty combination of sweet and spicy. I just love it!

I as well knocked back a bit on the honey as found it too sweet the first attempt..

My family rates the dishes I cook and this one did not go over very well.  The sauce was extremely sweet, and the chicken tastes a bit bland without adding spices before baking.

This recipe is sooooo good! The combination of the ingredients created a very good flavor. Next time however, I won't add as much red pepper and less honey. It was slightly too sweet and a little too spicy for my little ones. But it was still really hearty and good! Great recipe!

I actually had my family rate this recipe.  They did say that it was delicious.  I have been making things on this site for some time - but have not rated anything to date.  Although they liked this a lot - they gave it three stars (tough crowd).  They said that it was great but not as great as many of the other recipes that I had made from this site.  It took longer to cook than the recipe suggested. I will not make it again - cuz I am now used to raves and I want the 5 star rating from my family! It did look pretty on the table though and I like the flavor a lot!  I am giving it 4 stars because I am not sure 3 is sufficient!  It was very good!

This recipe was EXCELLENT.  I had never cooked with curry before and always wanted to try.  This was a great "first try."  My entire family loved it...even the 4 year old twin boys.  The house smelled so good while it was cooking.  The only thing I would probably change is to put the apples in a little later, because I needed to leave the chicken in the oven longer than 20 minutes to heat thoroughly.  That made the apples pretty mushy, and I'd prefer them a little more firm.  My husband's comment?  "This is a recipe to serve when we have company sometime!"  Sounds good to me.

Used chicken breasts and cooked them for 20 minutes and 325F before adding the sauce. They came out juicy and tender. I accidently used too much mustard and it was still good, even though the sauce didn't glaze.

The sauce is very good.  I had skinless chicken breast instead of a whole chicken.  The next I make this I would probably leave out the potatoes and then serve this over rice.   It would also interesting trying different vegetables like broccoli.

I did not pre cook the vegetables.  I just added them earlier to the chicken so,they roasted for at least an hour. I added a pealed and quartered butternut squash as well.  Then poured the glaze over all spreading with a brush the last twenty min.  I will make this again experimenting with different vegetables.

This recipe is super easy to make and so very delicious.   I used 2 large chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and it worked out really well.  Baking time was a bit shorter.

This was awesome. I used one of those FF BSCB packets from Costco, they have two HUGE breasts a piece and it's perfect to share for the three of us with one serving left over. I replaced the potatoes with cauliflower, and made everything else per the recipe. I'll make this one as a family dinner centerpiece again. Liked that it's a complete meal.

Very good!  I made it with boneless skinless breasts (salt and peppered) because that is what I had on hand.  I cooked it at 400 for 35 minutes.  Baked for 20 minutes, put on the sauce, and then cooked for another 15.  Next time, I think I will cook it for the same time but at 375.  The chicken was a little dry.  As per other's suggestions, I used what veggies I had on hand and did not precook the veggies.  I used zucchini, carrots, celery, cherry tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic, olive oil, and a bit of salt and pepper.  Very good flavor and it was great with the veggies.  It was a bit spicy.  I will definitely make it again.

This was excellent.  Very tasty.  Used chicken breast pieces, didn't bother pre-cooking any of the veggies and everything was ready after an hour at 375f.

SOOOO Good! I cut the potatos and carrots into large pieces and put into large roasting pan raw with chicken covered and cooked 45 mins.  Uncovered and added mushrooms and apples coated with sauce made with honey dijon dressing to reduce cost and calories and baked uncovered 30-45mins.  Best new roasted chicken recipe I've come across in a long time

This chicken dish is a favorite of my son's.  When I am serving it for a group I cut up the chicken before cooking to make serving easier.

This is ABSOLUTLY wonderful! I threw in all kind of veggies I had on hand because I had gone to the farmer's market. Potatoes, carrots, celery, squash, eggplant, onions. I doubled the sauce, but did not use a whole cup of honey, used about 2/3 cup. Used chicken breasts. My son who is a very picky eater and doesn't like to try new things, loved it. Next time I will throw in more veggies. What a great way to get my son to eat his veggies. He is allergic to egg and milk so hiding the taste of veggies is more difficult without the use of cheese, ranch, etc. this is fantastic!!!!!!!

This was purely awesome. Everyone from my picky 2 year old to Grandpa who "hates" curry went back for seconds! I made it in the slow cooker on High for 4 hours and it came out beautifully even with frozen thighs. I didn't realize I was down to my last tablespoon of honey beforehand, so I used honey mustard instead of dijon, and everything was still the perfect balance of sweet and savory.

Pretty good even though Im not big on curry. I noticed in the ingredients it doesnt say anything about cayenne pepper but in the directions it says to put that in the sauce mixture. Im assuming they meant the red pepper flakes?

My husband and I loved this.  Followed the ingredients exactly but cut the honey in half.  After eating it for two nights I took the left over sauce and the chicken stock from roasted chicken and put in pot and added one can chicken broth and remaining veggies and apple.  It made a delicious and unique soup for the third nights dinner.

Made this with chicken thighs.  I hadn't read the suggestion not to boil the potatoes and carrots and to roast them separately.  I will try it next time.  The sauce is absolutely fantastic!!  My family loved this chicken dish.

This is good, but the cooking times are a bit off--the chicken needed a bit longer, and I don't like boiling potatoes or carrots, so I just baked them with the chicken from the start.  I didn't use a whole chicken but it amounted to one--we have monster chickens with huge breasts, so it took a while.  I liked the sauce but bf isn't a fan of mustard, so I made him one piece of chicken without the sauce itself.  I didn't have apples or mushrooms, so I left them out.  All in all, pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making roast chicken.  I raised the temp to 400 degrees, as it seemed most other roasting recipes had a much higher temp.  I had a 4 pound chicken and it cooked for nearly two hours.  I cooked the chicken for about one hour and then added the vegetables, they could have cooked a bit longer.  Next time I will put the vegetables in right away with the chicken.  I also brined my chicken before cooking it and it was very moist.  The sauce was good, I only used 1/3 cup honey since everyone said it was too sweet, it seemed about right.  It turned out well, I would make it again.

I used two whole chickens and doubled the ingredients.  I didn't cook any veggies beforehand, I cutup potatoes and carrots and put them on the bottom to roast with the chicken.  It came out wonderful!!  Will definitely be making this again.  I believe the sauce would be good over other types of meat as well!

This is my first ever review of a recipe...had to do this one though! The only changes I made were 1) I added a lightly sauteed onion to the veggies and 2) I cooked the veggies separate from the chicken (did not boil the veggies, baked instead) until the last 20 minutes of cooking, when adding the sauce! I gave 1 star per person who gave a thumbs up! My family devoured this! My fiancee' was the one who said I should rate this recipe, called it a definite keeper! Amazingly, out of 3 kids not a single complaint! Oh, after I drained the drippings from the chicken I separated the fat from the broth and used the broth (plus a little chicken base and water) to make rice! Fantastic!

LOVED IT!!!!  i used chicken quarters and roasted them skin side down for 20 mins (as suggested by another reviewer) while the veggies (baby carrots and yukon gold potatoes) were steaming then put them in the pan, drizzled the sauce over all then cooked an additional 35-40 min.  i also doubled the sauce, however it was a bit too much so next time i try this i will try it with just the original amount.  i think i'll also try throwing it all in the crockpot like others have.

This was absolutely delicious. I used chicken breasts and simply put the veggies in the oven with the chicken and sauce for about an hour and fifteen minutes. Perfection! My husband said that it even made his carrots tasty, which is saying something since he generally hates them! Apples would be wonderful in this (as stated in the recipe) and I might also add some peas to the leftovers (if there are any).

I did this in my crockpot with a 5+lb chicken. I cooked it too long but it was still wonderful. I added a little chicken broth but won't next time. I ended up with a chicken stew. The flavor was great I just over cooked it. I can hardly wait to do it right.

Excellent!! Thanks for the great recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was outstanding. I also reduced the honey a bit and added some vegetable broth for consistancy. Loved the recipe!!

It was ok but nothing to write home about.  
I thought it was a little too sweet for my tastes and I used 1/3 cup of honey.  

Not a bad recipe but it was not what I was looking for.  I had very little sauce after inserting the vegetables the recipe called for.  I used 1 4 lb chicken because the reviews said there would be a surplus of sauce.  Maybe thats where I went wrong.

I tried this recipe for a friends bday. Everyone loved it. There were 2 vegetarians at the dinner and even they raved about the dish. The curry sauce enhanced both the veggies and chicken. Plus everything is cooked together, so very little clean up.

This was a wonderful recipe. I loved it and so did my family. However I added double the amount of veggetables and I had too much glaze.

It smelled really good, but the taste was so-so.  It was a bit too sweet for me.  But it tasted much better the next day so I might give it a try again.  I'll use less honey and add more chili pepper and curry powder.  I used regular mustard because I didn't have dijon mustard.

MMMM... this is fantastic! I used olive oil rather than butter and cut the homey down to 1/2 cup. The chicken and veggies tuen out as expected but the sauce is amazing! I'll probably put it on other things rather than make this exact recipe again. Oh, and I put a whole apple inside the chicken while it cooked!

Delicious! I used jasmine rice rather than potatoes, which gave it a great Thai taste. Will definitely cook this again. Maybe next time I will use chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. My family loved it. The only thing I can say is that a 3lb. chicken is not big enough. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms, and there was still plenty of sauce to cover it all.

This was amazing!  I'm not fond of dark meat and I cook for only myself, so I cut the recipe in half and used 2 bone-in chicken breasts.  (I also had to cook it slightly longer than the recipe states.)  I forgot about the garlic, which I love, but it still tasted wonderfully.   Can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow night!

This was fantastic.  DH, who does not like curry, loved this dish.  In regards to the chicken not being done: I cooked mine in a 6 qt. roaster and used a 4lb. whole (roasting) chicken for an extra 10-15 minutes on the roasting part and an extra 5 minutes or so after the glaze was on.  I think the smaller confines of a roaster cooked the chicken quicker than what my oven would have done.

It was heavenly!  I do have to say though that I followed the recipe to the letter of the law and the chicken was definitely not done after the 20 minute glaze treatment.  I had everyone sitting at the table and it looked perfect but had to send them away for a few minutes until the chicken was cooked throughout....so I would probably check the doneness before putting on the glaze next time.  I might try it with bonelss skinless breasts too..although it does make a beautiful presentation with the whole chicken.  When all was said and done though..I had to say...   YUM YUM YUM...  it is a keeper!  WOW..the smell!!!

This was so good! I made a couple changes because of what I had on hand: omitted ground ginger and salt, used regular mustard, and used a few squirts of sriracha sauce (a sweet asian hot sauce) because I ran out of curry powder. Boy was it yummy and goes well with rice. I also used about 10 wings instead and baked with a batch of sauce for about 30 min, then added veggies with another batch of sauce for another 20 min in the oven. Hubby said its a regular!

I loved this recipe.  I will definitly try this again.  Next time I will cook it breast side up because I liked the way the skin got but it was all on the bottom side.
