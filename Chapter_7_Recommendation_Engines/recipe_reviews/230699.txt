This is so easy to make and the cooking time of one hour is perfect if you have other dishes to get ready and want to serve this as a side dish.  I made the following substitutions to the dish based on what my family likes.  I didn't have the Fiesta Cheese soup so I used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup, and instead of the Cream of Chicken soup I used Cream of Potato.  I added one medium diced yellow onion, and for the buttery crackers (which I didn't have) I used, Fresh Gourmet's Texas Toast Seasoned Croutons.  I left everything else the same except I did not use any butter.  Between the fat in the cheese and ham I couldn't justify the added artery clogging butter.  The onion and croutons added some seasoning to what I think would have been a fairly bland dish.
