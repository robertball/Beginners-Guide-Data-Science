I did not have flax seed oil so I used whole flax seeds. I made no other changes. Very tasty and filling. Makes a very large smoothie and next time I will cut the recipe in half. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  It was an awesome change from the spirulina based smoothies I've been drinking and since it's just as healthy I may be permanently changing to it.  Thank you!  Loved.
