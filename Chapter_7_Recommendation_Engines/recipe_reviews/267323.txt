Easy and quick - thanks for a great recipe.  Can also add 1-2 tablespoons of espresso powder for coffee flavor. Leave in the vanilla, since it's the booze that keeps it from freezing rock hard.

This was really easy to make! I liked that there was less cleanup than using an ice cream maker. I found it very sweet when I tasted it, so I'm wondering if adding dark cocoa powder or ground coffee would help offset the sweetness.
