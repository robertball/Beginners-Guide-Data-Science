This little cookie was PERFECT. My mom and I cooked up 55 of them because we rolled them into small balls just big enough to fit a hersey kiss on them. They were bite size. My sister and I don't like nuts so we left out the egg white and the nuts, but other than that we follewed the recipe exactly. This is now my household's favorite cookie, and since all of a sudden my new hobbie is baking we are going to be cooking these up all the time. MAke sure after they are done cooking and have been sitting on the rack for 5 min, not to each them b/c you just won't want to stop. They taste best when they are cooled. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and would never do it again.  After seeing that the batter was too runny I eventually added more flour, then had to add sugar, also a little vinilla... blah blah blah.  My only recommendation, just use the hersheys recipe... sorry!!

These needed about 1/3 cup more flour and a teaspoon of vanilla. I would also chill this before you roll because it is too sticky otherwise. If I made these again, I would not press in the kiss until the cookie cooled for several minutes. The kisses started melting and I am not happy with the resulting puddle of chocolate.

I had to bake them for 15 min, perhaps because I used stoneware.  No problems with runny batter or melted kisses.  I look forward to making them again.

These cookies are very bland.  I read some of the reviews and decided to add a few tablespoons of peanut butter for flavor.  It didn't help much.
