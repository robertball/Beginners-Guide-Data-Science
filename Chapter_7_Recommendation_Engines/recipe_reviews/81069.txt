I have made this a few times. The first time I made it I thought it was a bit to thick and rich. I now use a little less cream chream cheese and add a little sour cream. Everytime I make it, everyone eats it all up - never any left over. I do use real crab though! Haven't tried it with the imitation crab.

Great recipe, everyone loved it.  I used real crab and 1 less package of cream cheese, as well as old bay and hot pepper jack cheese w/ jalapeno.  I doubled the recipe too.

Everybody loved it!  I combined several of the suggestions from other reviews to make up my own version.  I used 12 oz. lite cream cheese, 2 Tbls. lite sour cream, 1 tsp. Old Bay, 1 tsp. jalpenos, Pepper Jack cheese and the juice of one lime (about 2 Tbls).  I sprinkled the top with a little more Old Bay, garlic powder and paprika (for color). Great consistency, flavor and presentation.  I only cooked it 15-20 min. Served with Tortilla chips.

Great as a quesadilla filler. Spread on tortilla, sprinkle additional shreaded cheese on top to bind, add diced jalapenos if you are so inclined, top with another tortilla and bake til cheese melts. Serve with avacado, mango and tomato salsa. A huge hit!

This was gone before I knew what happened!  Lowfat cream cheese worked fine here,  I used real crabmeat in a pouch and added extra jalapeno and lemon juice.  It was still pretty thick, so I added some lowfat sour cream.  The next time I make this I may add a chipotle pepper for a smoky flavor.

Excellent recipe.  A few notes, though.  For my tastes, I went heavy on the garlic.  I think the addition of artichoke hearts and some freshly shredded parmesan would've been nice.  

Due to the nature of the consistency of all the cheese, though, you MUST serve it immediately to a hungry crowd.  It starts thickening immediately and starts breaking chips quite quickly. That's not the recipe's fault, just the result of so much melted cheese.

Also, if you make ahead as the creator suggested you can (which I did and she's right, it's fine) keep in mind that you need to keep it in the oven a little while longer because you're having to heat up your dish and the cold center of the dip.  

This dip was a huge hit at our dinner party last night. Thanks!

I made this dip today for a Christmas potluck at work.  Everyone raved about good it is and made copies of the recipe.  I left out the jalapeno & instead added Old Bay Seasoning.  This is a keeper and I will be making it again for our Christmas Eve Gathering.

Very good but I made some alterations: I used approx 1 full cup dungeness lump crab, 1pkg 8oz cream cheese (vs 2), 6oz (total) pepper jack and otherwise stucke to the recipe minus the jalepenos.  It was very tasty and very rich.  I would definitely make this again but add some seasoning like old bay, maybe a little tapatio, and some chopped/thawed/drained frozen spinach.

EVERYONE LOVES THIS DIP!!!  I have had a ridiculous number of people ask me for this recipe and some of my friends won't let me come over for parties any more unless I promise to bring it.  Believe me, you want to make this dip!

Delicious and easy to make!  I made this for my Super Bowl party and everyone was raving about it!  I actually gave it out to several of my friends.  Delicious with the lime juice.

Great dip, thank you!  I've also found that using the same amount of shrimp with this works Great too!  Because of the consistency of this dip, what I like to do is thinly slice a sourdough bagette and coat both sides w/garlic butter(many ways to make/buy your own) and toast slices in toaster oven until lightly brown.

This is easy and delicious, but like the other reviewers I doctored it up.  Added 1/4 cup cocktail sauce, about 10 dashes of hot sauce, 1/2 cup light sour cream, and some old bay seasoning.  Served with crackers hot from the oven, gone very quickly!

I thought this recipe was kinda bland, but it was a good base. I think that in the future I would ad more spices/veggies. Possibly red peppers, more garlic, onion, etc...

A very good dip.  Most people really enjoyed it when I served it.  I liked being able to use imitation crab.  I often find that when I have this in my fridge, there aren't many recipes that I can use it in.  Thanks - great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! Makes all of my grand nieces and sisters so jealous when they sample my crab dip! My husband Staniel requests me to make this dish every morning! He likes to put it over cheese curds and hot oil! Makes a lovely little dish of dip!

I decided to make this recipe for a friend of mine.
She loves seafood, while I'm not a huge seafood fan.

Followed the recipe, then filled jalapenos with the dip and grilled them!

Awesome recipe!

I used a full pound of imitation crabmeat, shredded finely.  Instead of green onion, used about a tbsp of red onion (I know it's not the same flavor, but it's all I had).  Upon mixing everything with the creamcheese, the dip felt too stiff to me (even my hand mixer was stalling), such that I knew it would break the buttery crackers when dipping, so I added about 1/3 cup buttermilk to just get it to a more spreadable consistency.  My monterey jack cheese was with jalapeno peppers, so that added some more heat - might be too spicy for some people that way, but was perfect for me!.

It was a hit!  I used a small can of green chilies instead of the jalapeño pepper, plus a little salt and pepper.  Perfect!
