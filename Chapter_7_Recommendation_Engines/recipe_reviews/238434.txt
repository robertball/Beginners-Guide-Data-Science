I did not add the additional sugar. Mine turned out chunkier than I like, it could be my blender. The taste was great. Next time I would make this without the ice, I think I would like it a lot better.

This is one heck of a dessert drink!  Yum! Yum!  I thought it would be too sweet, so I almost didn't put in the sugar--but it all works out well.  Thanks so much, superwoman!
