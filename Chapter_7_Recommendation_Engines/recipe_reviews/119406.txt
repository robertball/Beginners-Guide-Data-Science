I had this recipe saved forever before I actually made it because I didn't think I would like it.  I was very surprised, however, and loved it!  I used 4 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs.  It has a great flavor and is very filling.

This was fantastic! I used olive oil in place of veggie oil, jack cheese instead of mozzarella, and left out the celery salt since I had none. My husband and I both loved it! Sooo tasty and filling.

This was a lot better than I expected. I think though that Ranch style chili beans would be better as the kidney beans were still a little bland. I topped this with cayenne pepper sauce and it was the perfect touch. I used some freeze dried chives and some onion powder and left out the fresh onion. I'd eat this again, but like I said maybe Ranch Style brand chili beans would have been a little better.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe except for - no onions or celery salt.  I did add fresh chopped spinach when I sauteed the veggies.  And, added guacamole on top.  I will definitely make it again!

Yummm :)  I didn't have beans so I used chickpeas and I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce and it was delicious.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Very good, although adding a little salt to the filling makes the flavors pop.  Next time we'll add a little crisped ground beef flavored with salt, pepper, and chili powder to it for some texture as it was all soft, no crunch.

Instead of using mozzarella cheese, I used fat free cheddar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is, and it was DELICIOUS!.  I will definitely be making these again!

I like the idea of this omelet, but the chili part needs work. I would rather use my own recipe for chili or even open up canned chili. This chili bean recipe is a little flat for me.  I also used a Mexican blend cheese, since I think mozzarella is tasteless.  Great idea for meatless Monday.
