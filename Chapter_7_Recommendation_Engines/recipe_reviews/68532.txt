This recipe is awesome! The only recommendation I would make (my mother was raised in India, so she taught me): the difference between a good curry & a great curry is what my aunt called the broth. The broth is what is made with the spices & the onion. The curry powder (paste is even better) should be cooked in the oil until it is ready - usually about 5 minutes. Then add the onion & spice - cook until the onion is translucent. This will take about 10 minutes, but it makes all the difference in the world. Add more oil as the onion is cooking, if necessary. Then add the tomato (fresh is even better - strained) and cook it for a little while. NOW you're ready to make the curry. 

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family!

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: UPDATED If you've never had an Indian type cuisine, this is a GREAT one to start with because you can't screw it up!  The hardest part is just finding these items at the store if it's your 1st time.  Know you have to buy sweetened coconut milk, not the unsweetened kind & "lite coconut milk" for those weight watchers works well too!  When I add the stewed tomatoes, I use my spatula and cut them into smaller pieces.  Who wants a big chunk & who wants to end up w/nothing?  I find cooking it uncovered is your best bet unless you want it simmering FOREVER.  Uncovered at a steady med. will still takes 50-60 before the sauce thickens.  Any rice goes well with this, so just choose the kind you like.  I also only use 2 chicken breasts (1 pound), but keep all the other amounts since this is just for a family of 3.  If I used 2lbs, I'd definitely have to use more sauce if cooking uncovered.  Note: Expect your house to smell like curry 24hrs after you fix this (in case some of you have company coming over the next day).  We have this regularly, so I know!!! ;) This is truly the best!

I didn't listen to the reviews when I decided to make this recipe with all the liquids listed in the ingredients.  And I'm glad I did!  It thickened up VERY well - but I did let it sit on the stove and simmer for a while (maybe an hour?).  I just couldn't justify tossing out the water from the tomatoes, thinking I'd lose all those vitamins... I also only used 1 tsp of oil, light coconut milk, and extra curry.  This was GREAT!  It totally hit the spot! It's a great healthy recipe if you have veggies on the side (the coconut milk I used only had 6 grams fat per 1/2 cup!).

My husband said this recipe was restaurant quality...I used 1 TBS. of garlic, partially drained the tomatoes, added 2 cubed red potatoes and sprinkled in some red pepper flakes to make it more spicy.  I'll make this one again!

Amazing!!!! When I saw how much curry powder I was putting in I have to admit I was a lil worried but the 1st time I make someone else's recipe I follow it to the T before making any changes. This is awesome just the way it is written!! Great flavor!!! My husband loved it and my mom asked for the recipe! Thank you!!!

Excellent every time I make it, at least once a month! Sometimes I use tomato paste if I don't have sauce and I often make it in the crockpot which combines all the flavors just perfectly! Serve with orange slices.

This recipe is definately a 5, no matter how you "tweek" it according to personal taste. I used 1 Tbsp red curry paste sauted in the oil with 1 large dice onion and 2 cloves garlic,4 pieces fresh lemon grass, @ 1 tbsp fresh basil. Added the chicken, 3 large diced potato, several baby carrots cut on diganal, 1/2 can leftover tomatoes and 1/2 half can leftover tomato paste and 1 and 1/2 can leftover coconut milk. IT WAS THE BOMB!   Much better than our local Thai restaurant, served with Thai Cucumber Salad made with sesame seeds instead of peanuts. Curry served over Jasmine rice. Possibly the best dinner I've made and my profession is a cook!

I did not care for this. It tasted like canned tomato soup with milk and curry. Leave out the can of tomato sauce! I had to add  red curry paste, fish sauce and sweet chili sauce. This won't stay on my recipe list.

This is my second comment on this recipe - still love it, it has become a staple dinner for us.  I made it yesterday and did two things differently:  (1) I used diced pork instead of chicken, and (2) I added frozen peas.  I LOVED how the pork changed the flavor, and the peas were excellent.  Enjoy!
---------------------
Original Comment:  WOW!  This recipe was fabulous!  I loved the tomatoes in it -- I used whole stewed tomatoes vs diced.  It was a little on the sweet side, so next time I'll probably 1/2 the sugar, but otherwise this dish was perfect!  My kids, 8 & 11, wanted seconds, and with my 8yr old, that's saying a lot!!  Good job!

Loved it!  After 2 hours of simmering, it was still runny, so just before serving, I mixed one tablespoon of cornstarch with about 2T. cold water, then added it to the sauce and boiled for one minute.  It was just right.  I also added cashews and it was delicious.

I followed this recipe's ingredients exactly except for reducing the sugar to 2T.  I followed this method:  Dry-fry the curry (added a few cumin seeds whole) until fragrant.  Add oil and simmer.  Add onions and garlic, simmer until browning.  Add chicken and brown.  Then add the rest of the ingredients.  I had to admit I was skeptical about the thinness of the sauce, and I wasn't impressed with the flavor at first.  After an hour of UNCOVERED simmering, the sauce was amazingly thick, and so rich I could hardly stand it!  This will be my permanent coconut chicken recipe.  I will not go looking for another one!!!

Have been making this dish for quite a while now about twice a month and thought I would share my preferences.  I use Goya brand coconut milk; it just tastes better than other brands I have used.  I also use Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Let the onion and garlic mix cook on a lower temp for about 10 minutes to infuse flavor.  Also, mine takes just about 2 1/2 hours to simmer on low before it's ready.  Try putting a small handful of golden raisins on top of the dish once plated.  They really add a lot of texture and a subtle fruity taste to this dish.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Adding jalepenos and using low fat coconut milk made this recipe much better.

I made this dish again this week for a son who was visiting from out of town.  Still delicious, but beware if you're planning to increase the amount of curry powder you use in your recipe; all curry powders are not the same.  I used the same amount this time but a different brand, and the curry was much stronger.  Enjoy!  Original Review: I've tried several recipes from this site, but this is the first one I liked well enough to review.  It was wonderful from start to finish.  From the moment the oil and curry began to heat, my husband and son began pestering me about when it would be ready.  The aroma alone drove them crazy.  And when the meal was over, my son declared it was so good, he could eat till he made himself sick.  My husband seconded that opinion.  I made a few small changes, some on purpose, some by accident.  First I doubled everything but the tomato sauce so i would have leftovers.  Also, I added about 1/2 tsp each of paprika and ground red pepper for a little spicy kick.  I simmered it, uncovered, over a low heat for about 2 hours and it thickened perfectly.  And just before it finished cooking, I added 1/2 cup shredded coconut.  Those are things I did on purpose.  I accidently tripled, rather than doubled, the curry powder (misread the recipe - should have worn my glasses), but it didn't hurt a thing.  There were no complaints of blandness!  
It was so easy and my family loved it.  The vote was unanimous, this one will make a return appearance at our table.

I thought this was wonderful!! I used everything called for in the recipe, just added mushrooms and corn. I did add waaaay more curry and sugar than the recipe called for, but that's what suited our taste. Made me think I was a world class chef, it tasted so good! I told my husband, "See, if we would have gone out to eat tonight, this would have easily cost us $30!". Great recipe that doesn't take too long to make and it tastes great!

This was really marvelous! One of the best recipes I've found on this site. At first glance, this dish seemed a tad sweet--stewed tomatoes and sugar. In my version, I upped the onion and garlic, decreased the sugar to 1 TB, and eliminated the tomato sauce (but used the stewed tomatoes and juice). I also added about 1 tsp ground ginger (would have used fresh but didn't have any), a handful of golden raisins, and a big pinch of cayenne. What a delightful interplay of spicy, sweet, and creamy smooth. Served with basmati rice. (Be careful of using elderly curry powder with this dish. It needs to be bright.)

THANK YOU, Roma, for one of the simplest, easiest, most delicious recipes I've ever inherited or found! This is amaaaazing and delicious and had my boyfriend thanking me for days. TIP: I first made it without the tomatoes since I was out, and cooked the chicken all the way through. It ended up overcooked and rubbery. Might be the high altitude I live in, or the electric stovetop set a bit too high. I also simmered it covered, which will take away juices. The 2nd time, I only browned the chicken in the curry, oil, onion, garlic sauce. Then added the coconut milk, tomato sauce & tomatoes & simmered UNCOVERED. At about 30-40 mins, the chicken was cooked, tender, juicy, and you could pull it apart with a fork. Just a tip for anyone maybe new to cooking chicken or meat or just cooking. This recipe is HANDS DOWN DELICIOUS.

This was delicious just the way it is. I followed directions perfectly and it made enough for 2 dinners! My husband and myself along with our two daughters (ages 2.5 and 4) both loved it! Served with some flat pita bread because it made a lot of sauce! Delicious.

I'm a newbie cook, but love exotic dishes that are usually too complicated for me to attempt. This is the BEST curry recipe for a beginner and it taste SO AMAZING!  After reading reviews, I opted for 4 chicken breasts, an extra tablespoon of curry powder, substituted tomato  sauce with tomato paste (A MUST), used UNsweetened coconut milk and half the amount of sugar. I also added a stalk of celery finely chopped and 1/2 yellow bell pepper after the chicken. Then once the milk and tomatoes were put in, I added a couple dashes of cinnamon, chili powder, cumin and a lil red pepper flakes. The 3 biggest complaints I read was that it's too sweet, too bland &/or not thick enough. Follow above and you won't have any of those problems!  My boyfriend says it's one of my best dishes yet.  Enjoy!

This is a beginner curry to make.  It's easy and the taste will please most everyone.  I used Penzey's sweet curry powder and it was wonderful, even my 3 year old liked it.  I did have to simmmer it uncovered to get the sauce to thicken up.

We really enjoyed this dish. I read the reviews and used the tomato paste and curry paste with red pepper (we like it hot). I also added crushed cashews, and I think that was one of the best parts of the dish. I also added portobella sliced mushrooms and they were delicious with the rest of the ingredients! Thanks!

Good curry recipe. I've had better curries but I guess the final result  highly depends on the quality of the curry powder!

Oh yes! This is a truly lovely curry and so little work. I have made a more complicated curry from this site before but I think I actually enjoyed this one better. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for a few changes: a little less tomato puree and only 2 tbs sugar as the sauce was quite sweet from the coconut milk already. When I put everything in I tasted it and thought it was pretty good. Then I kept coming back to it during the 45 minute simmering time and couldn't believe how it was getting more and more amazing as the flavours were coming together. The end result was delicious. Served it with white+wild rice mix, I wish I had naan bread to mop the sauce. Yumm! UPDATE: I have tried this with some chopped cashew nuts added to the sauce for variety and it worked very nicely.

This is wonderful! We had it the first night, and the next day all I could think about was having the leftovers for dinner. I followed the prep directions of the first reviewer - cook the curry spice for five min., then the onion until translucent, about ten min. I know a lady from India, and I remember her telling me to cook the onions slowly, and not to brown them like we do for American food. This is an amazing recipe, company worthy! Thank you Roma!

This smelled amazing while it was simmering and we were looking forward to our dinner. We were very disappointed in the final flavor. It was pretty bland or flat, with no depth to the flavors. I even used some extra curry based on suggestions, and 'cooked' it as directed. After tasting it, I added some Garam Masala powder, and some red curry paste I had on hand. This improved things quite a bit.

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time I used red curry paste (because that's all I had) and the second time I used curry powder, like the recipe called for.  The recipe had much more flavor when I used the curry paste, so that's how I will continue make it in the future.  Be warned though - in equal quantities, curry paste is much spicier!  Other changes/substitions - light coconut milk, splenda instead of sugar, and doubled the onion content (just because I REALLY like onions).  Served over jasmine rice, this was a great meal.  Thanks!

I didn't think this was going to be as wonderful as it was! I'm used to grinding tons of spices to make an Indian dish, but this was warm and comforting and delish! I added some red pepper flakes because we like it spicy, and removed the lid the last ten minutes to thicken the sauce. We served this with a cucumber raita and naan bread and basmati rice. yum! Thanks for the recipe.

WAY too much sugar and liquid.  I had to thicken the sauce and it helped a little, but the sweetness was overwhelming and neither my husband or I ate much of it.  We are very enthusiastic lovers of indian food and this recipe was very unauthentic and disappointing.  Will not make again, at least not with adding more spices, reducing the liquid, and omitting the sugar.

Very tasty with some additional tweaking. I omitted the tomato sauce and sugar, and drained the tomatoes before adding them. Furthermore, to spice it up a bit, I added a little extra cumin, cardamom, cayenne pepper, and fresh lime juice. Served with chopped cilantro over rice. I think next time I may try making it with "light" coconut milk so I don't need to feel so guilty about eating it!

I am eatting this as we speak. My husband is not really fond of meals like this but he loves it too. I changed it a little. For one, I cooked it in my crockpot on low for 5 hours (after browning the chicken). Added one whole sweet onion, added 6 green onions and some crushed chili peppers. I left out the tomato sauce. This dish is awesome and even my two year old loves it!!

This was very good and easy to make. I always try to make the recipe the first time exactly as stated, but I only had a pound of chicken breast.
 I made it with that and it was perfect. I liked having more sauce to coat my rice. I never had a problem with it not getting thick like some others. In my opinion, this is a milder/sweeter curry recipe (but i used a sweet smokey curry powder). Shop around for diff. curry powders it's fun to taste the differences and experiment with them.

Excellent!! Two changes, one small, one not so. I used canned tomatoes only, because I did not have tomato sauce in the house, and I added lots and lots of cilantro - which is an either love it or hate it item and I am in the first group.

Great recipe, cheat to make.  40 minutes is enough time to simmer.  Make sure you do a strong simmer not a rice simmer.  Mild bubbling at Medium low for 40 minutes does the trick.  Your house will smell like curry for a few days regardless of how many febreeze bottles you use.  Next time I plan on putting in some Spinach or Peas.  Make sure you use the whole onion and a little extra oil (2 - 2.5 Tbsp).

Very, very good recipe.  I read other reviewers suggestions and made a paste out of the curry powder and added it to the oil to cook before adding the onions and garlic.  I believe this really made a difference in the final product.  Next time I would definitely add an extra can of stewed tomatoes and a little more tomato sauce.  Overall very delicious over a bed of Basmati rice.

I was disappointed in this recipe... Maybe I was looking for something more authentic, but the flavor was really lacking. If you do make it, here are a few suggestions: It needs WAY more curry, maybe double or triple the amount, don't add the sugar (coconut milk is already sweet enough), add 1-2 tbsp ea. of coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (optional). I used yellow curry (better, in my opinion), and will probably omit both the tomatoes and sauce next time and add veggies.

This recipe was pretty good.  I wasn't too sure about the coconut milk but you didn't even know it was in it once the final product was finished.  I think I might add more tomatoes to it next time.  Overall pretty good and well received with my kids.

Wonderful! I used curry paste (add extra tbsp) and cooked in oil for 5 min to as suggested. I left out the tomato sauce & drained the stewed tomatoes. I also added broccoli, & julienned carrots/zucchini 15 before serving. Perfect!

This recipe turned out great, but I made a few modfications. Increased the curry to 3 T, used a whole onion, and decreased the sugar to 1.5 T. In addition, I added 1 C chopped carrots with the coconut milk. Also recommend salting to taste once everything is simmering... I added 1/4 tsp. to the recipe. Well definitely make again!

This is delicious! Thank you ROMA for the recipe I've been wanting for years after having in a Thai restaurant! My boyfriend and I made this together, using chicken thighs instead of breasts because we really wanted the meat to remain moist. We used a mixture of curries, including Penzy's sweet curry (yum), red curry paste, and a curry powder that I got at an Indian store. We added two minced serrano's for added heat. Chaokoh coconut milk was the  PERFECT product for this-nice and thick and I highly recommend it. We drained the tomatoes, added a pinch of lemongrass, only 2 tablespoons of sugar, and simmered uncovered for less than thirty minutes and it was perfectly thick, lucious, and creamy. Even though we used all the tomato products (minus the drained liquid), this did not have a strong tomato flavor or even a red color. It was a golden orange- probably because most of our curry was the yellow variety. Served with Indian jeera rice (which includes cumin seed) and a cold chick pea and cucumber salad. You deserve all five stars for sure! Can't wait to eat the leftovers and make again! Now- to everyone who had disappointing results I just want to say how important it is to use high quality ingredients- especially the curry mixture and coconut milk. The spice is such a dominant flavor in the dish that a substandard mixture could very well ruin it. It's hard to end with a quality dish if you don't start with quality ingredients.

I made this a week ago and have been drooling and dreaming about making it again. I did the 10 minutes oil curry aromatic cook time, exact sugar (maybe less next time), a little more sauce and heat (dried red chilis), fresh tomatoes instead of canned,  tomato paste instead of sauce, chicken thigh instead of chicken boob (fresh I cut off bone). With the fresh tomatoes I used roma and sauteed them after the onion was about translucent. I quartered my tomato and kinda squeezed out some of the acidic gel/seed stuff before dicing. I used the Polar brand UNSWEETENED canned coconut milk. It was full fat and I have no regrets. I used my japanese rice cooker and added 2 cardamon pods and a cinnamon stick for seasoned rice and of course naan bread (Costco cheat) reheated over open flame. It took me about an hour start to in ma belly!

This was my first time using powder curry so I was a bit nervous. However it turned out GREAT! I made it mostly according to the recipe excluding the onions (not a fan) and using the Taste of Thai lite coconut milk. It did not have a strong coconut flavor that one might expect. You could not even tell it had coconut milk in it. But I do believe it added a richness that my fiance and I really enjoyed. I paired it with white jasmine rice and the naan recipe from this site which was amazing as well. It does take awhile to get thick (about an hour on simmer) but it's worth it because the chicken was so tender! Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!

This was mmmmmm good! My friend brought us some curry paste from Bangkok and we wanted to use it. So the only thing we did differently was use the paste instead of curry powder. Even my two year old gobbled it up!!! We served it over rice and couldn't wait to eat left overs!

Yummy!  Added a bit more curry powder, some cayenne pepper, less sugar.  Sauce was soupy, next time will simmer with no cover.   Had over saffron rice.  Left overs of the Curried Coconut Chicken were eaten over egg noodles and were fabulous!  Had a nice fresh green salad and garlic bread on the side. Wow!

I was highly disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and got a dish that tasted more like tomatoes and chicken than coconut curry.  I've made several different types of curry and I probably should have noticed how much more tomatoes this recipe calls for compared to others, but it should not be called 'curried coconut chicken'.

Very disappointed.  This is NOT the same Curry Chicken you get in Restaurants.  I was looking for the Golden Yellow Sauce.  This one is reddish pink.  And I've never had Curry Chicken with tomato's in it. So if you want the traditional curry chicken this one is not it.

Loved this one!  I followed the recipe to the letter and it did not disappoint.  It was just what I was looking for.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My only "complaint" is that my house smelled of curry for several days afterward--ha!  Will make this one again.

Absolutely yummy! This was so delicious, we were fighting for the last serving. I added sliced carrots and some ground cloves. I also omitted the tomato sauce. I am very picky - If I like it, you know it's a hit!

This is excellent.  I used tomato paste mixed with water instead of tomato sauce, and added cumin, ground cloves and turmeric along with some frozen peas, and an extra tablespoon of sugar.  All my boyfriend kept saying was, "Delicious.  Absolutely delicious!" and then practically licked his plate clean!  This was easy to make and very flavorful, and I will definitely make it again soon.

Wonderful! My changes included more greens (bok choy, and green onions rather than regular onions. I doubled the curry powder (Oriental curry, which is a bit more spicy) Splenda instead of regular sugar. More options to play with--napa cabbage, broccoli, etc.

Very good base recipe for what I wanted.  I actually mangled it quite a bit by adding sliced mushrooms, carrots, and some cauliflower.  I left out the tomato sauce because I was afraid it would be tomatoey.  I used Madras curry hoping that it would be quite spicy, but it wasn't.  Maybe adding more?  The coconut milk was probably the culprit, although it added excellent flavor.  Highly recommend this as a springboard to culinary creativity.

Great recipe! Big hit with my family and friends. I have tweaked it a bit and added some things. I add peas, carrots, red peppers and carrots. I also add a dash of cinnimon and a a large pinch of red pepper flakes for some spice.

oh-my-word!  this has shown me that for sure we do not like curry in my house.  I had leftover coconut milk I wanted to use up from another recipe and ecided to be adventurous tonight.  poor choice on my part - this is absolutely awful!  to make things worse, i think my house is going to smell like curry forever.  fans going, windows open, and staying out of the kitchen for the next several hours for sure!

This dish is great! My boyfriend took a "break" from eating because he was full, then went back for more. I did add a few more spices since we like to assault our taste buds with a burst of flavor. Along with curry powder I added 1tsp cumin, 1tsp graham masala, 1tsp tumeric, and 1tsp ground coriander. I made saffron rice to go with it...soooo good :)

Loved this! It was simple and tasty, even the curry skeptics loved it! I just did what some other reviewers did and I cut the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes in half as well as the sugar. I added some chili pepper flakes for extra heat. Thanks for adding variety into our menu!!

This is delicious even using a "lite" coconut milk, only 1/2 tsp salt & pepper and only 2 TBSP sugar. I served over Saffron rice and added carrot slices, yellow & green peppers.  I did not think it was neccesary to simmer as long as recipe stated  (I didn't want my veggies and chicken overcooked) so I left lid off and only simmered about 10 miin. Which resulted in about 3 cups of (thin) broth to spoon over our rice. YUM!Moist chicken, flavorful broth, and veggies with a lightly spicy kick... will make this one over and over, again. Thank you, for sharing!

Yum! My husband rates this as one of his top favorite dishes, especially when served with Thai cucumber salad.  I used 2 Tbs of curry powder, as called for, but added a bit of curry paste for additional heat and flavor.  As another reviewer stated, 6 chicken breast halves is the perfect amount of meat for the sauce.

This was surprisingly great. I'm not usually a fan of curry, but DH has been requesting more Thai-like recipes so I thought the pairing of coconut milk and curry would satisfy him. The recipe is very easy to make. I didn't have to alter a thing and it came out great. Even my 11 year old liked it. We paired it with brown rice and it was a perfect meal. Thank you for the keeper recipe!!

This recipe is REALLY REALLY good!  The flavors all together are amazing.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I did feel that it lacked flavor which is why I added a little bit of cayenne which made it perfect! Thanks a lot for this recipe.

My family is used to Thai style curry and have never had an Indian style curry dish before.  One comment I must make is I guess from frying the curry (which is really interesting) my house and my hands smelled like curry for two days!

I really liked this dish.  My six year old liked it but my husband and three year old were on the fence about it having not eaten a dish like this before.

Some changes made thanks to other reviewers, I cut the sugar to one tablespoon as I don't like sweet main dishes, no tomatoe sauce at all, and I strained the stewed tomatoes removing most of the juice.  
I also added freshly grated ginger with the 4 cloves of garlic which I sauteed in peanut oil.  In addition I added cayenne pepper, paprika and I thought it needed some tang so I added the juice of one lime and topped with green onions.
Thanks for the recipe.  Delicious.

Very good and just what I was hankering for. After reading the reviews, I left out the tomato sauce as I prefer a more true coconut curry flavor. I would NOT skimp on full-fat coconut milk on this, I'm sure the flavour would get lost with light. I used full fat and it was amazing. Only other changes I made were adding an extra tsp. of salt to bring out the flavours, and included a chopped red pepper. We served on rice. Husband loved it, and we'll definitely make again.

Now I changed up the recipe a little but it came out AMAZING! I cut out the tomatoe sauce and only put about 1/3 of the diced tomatoes and about 1/3 of the coconut milk so it wouldn't be too soupy. I cut out the sugar but instead I added sweetened coconut slivers (you can find them next to the chocolate chips in the bakers section). I also used olive oil instead of vege oil. Good over rice!

This was a fabulous dish, that was super easy to make.  However, it took me two weeks to get the curry smell out of my house.  I finally had to paint my home, wipe down cabinets with bleach and steam clean the carpets.  Great meal, but caused a LOT of housework to removed the smell.  I loved the meal, but not worth all the housework :)

This turned out pretty poorly.  The smell was unappealing. The chicken was moist but the ratios seem to be off.  I wouldn't make this again.

I had to make some changes to make this to my liking.  I added a good bit more curry powder, and only put in 2 tbsp. of sugar.  I don't think it even needs that much.  I also think there is too much tomato sauce i it and would use less if I made it again.  Initially it was pretty soupy, so I simmered it without a cover to thicken it, and it was fine after that.

Thank you for your recipe. It was tasty! I threw all the ingredients in a crock pot with a few substitutions and additions. I didn't have stewed chopped tomatoes, so I threw in a can of rotel. I also had one pound of cooked chopped chicken, so I put in one pound instead of two pounds of chicken and added potatoes and carrots to the mix. I also added more salt and threw some broccoli in for the last 30 minutes and it turned out great!

Absolutely delicous!  So easy and the flavors come together so much better than they read in the recipe.  I did not have coconut milk but used the creamed coconut (the block - not the sweetened cream of coconut!) and added water to make up to 14 oz.  This dish reminded me of a butter chicken dish I had tried at a local Indian restaurant.  Will definately make again.

I would use this recipe unaltered to introduce people to curry or altered as a base recipe for a fantastic curry..  I believe this would have been very bland if I had stuck to the recipe.  I added twice as much curry, some cumin, chili powder and a few dashes of cinnamon.  After all of my adjustments it tasted really fantastic and had a full on curry flavor.

NOT what I had in mind.  I was worried about the tomatoes in chicken curry, and I was right.  It tasted more like chicken curry soup.  It also needed almost twice the salt.  I probably either wont make this again, or change it big time.

The entire time this was cooking, my husband kept insisting he wouldn't like it and asking that I make him a sandwich for dinner instead.  He tried one bite after it was done and LOVED it.  I'm not a stranger to curry, so I wasn't scared, but I thought it was great too.  I followed the recipe just as written except that I simmered it for about two hours over medium-low heat.  The sauce was nice and thick, and the chicken just fell apart - it was SO good.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good recipe, but like others said the sauce is a little runny.  I added red chili pepper flakes to kick up the heat and also added 4 red potatoes cut into 1 inch cubes.  Next time I will allow it to cook all day in a crock pot!

I followed the recipe exactly but found this to be too sweet and lacking something.  Used a jar of yellow curry powder (Morton & Bassett) and cooked the curry as written.  Maybe my curry powder was the problem.

Fantastic. I like the rec. to cut the tomatos up but really you need two cans (drain 1 can of liquid) of it for 2 lbs. meat.  Also it would have been helpful to reserve at least 1/4 cup of liquid to add cornstarch to for thickener. The long simmering time could be shortened by 15 min. this way.

I simmered it for about an hour to reduce the liquids.  I think that's why it turned so red from the tomatoes.  It was still very good.  And yes, the house still smells of curry 3 days later.  :)

This was fantastic.  A little too sweet if anything, next time a little less sugar.  We diced up a mid/small zucchini and squash and served over rice.  Can't wait to make again!

I'm forced to give this recipe one star only because it won't post my review without one. I followed this recipe to the "T" and my family and I were disappointed. I love Indian food and frequent many Indian restaurants. This recipe was way too sweet and had an odd flavor. I wouldn't recommend it.

We really enjoyed this dish. Following other reviewers advice I omitted the tomato sauce and sugar, and drained the stewed tomatoes. I simmered this for about an hour and served it over jasmine rice. I doubled the curry and added red pepper flakes and cayenne to suit our tastes for spicy Indian food. The coconut flavor was not very pronounced although I added shredded coconut. The only remedy for this may be to add fresh raw coconut, but not sure I'm willing to go to the trouble. Overall, this is delicious, and I will make often - even for entertaining. Thanks!

Wow! Thank you so much.  This is really close to one of my favorite dishes, chicken tikka masala.  It was sooo simple and didn't require many ingredients or steps.  I used a sweet curry powder and assume the results you get depend on what kind of curry you use. I did find it a bit sweet and tomatoey and it needed to be balanced a bit with some spice.  I threw in some red chile flakes to taste and about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp garam masala and it was the best thing ever.  Next time I will definately double this.  I stole my husbands leftovers 'cause I couldn't get enough.

AVOID THIS RECIPE! This was tomato soup with chicken and onions. It didn't taste like curry, it did not have a pleasant color. It was gross and I just wasted all that money on ingredients and half my curry powder bottle on something disgusting.  I should have known when I saw no other recipes that called for tomato in curry. Ugh, I'm so upset!

Hated it! I tasted it while it was simmering and it did, in fact, taste like tomato soup! No curry or coconut flavor to be found! I had to dump my entire bottle of curry powder into it to make it taste moderately of curry and it is still too sweet, the 3 Tbsp sugar is a HUGE mistake! This is more like ketchup on rice, but might taste better if you put potatoes in it while simmering, because potatoes and ketchup is always good, lol! I was worried after reading the original review that said it tasted like tomato soup but decided to try it anyway, as I know there are always those people who love it and hate it and thought I would be another lover of it, and nope! They were right! I even did as Cook Stephanie said and made the "broth". Did not affect the flavor one bit, the tomato overpowers everything.

Thank you but too mild. I agree with another review that said "It tasted like canned tomato soup" with coconut milk and mild curry flavor. My family agreed. Of course, we love spicy so this recipe was way too mild for us even after adding some ingredients of my own. I'll go back to the other curry recipe I have. For those of you who prefer mild curry, you might like this...just not for me.

I was so sure I was gong to like this - it had great reviews!  Followed the recipe to they"T" too ... Had to thicken it (too runny) and it just tasted like tomato soup with chicken.  The chicken could have cooked in the 30-40 minute simmer - which would have saved a lot of time too.  I love curry too but I don't recommend this one ;(

So, so, good!  I didn't have the full 2 lbs. of chicken so instead, towards the end I added some yellow squash to make up the difference.  Wow!  Delicious and healthy!  I served this over rice stick noodles.

I made this for dinner tonight after a friend had recommended this specific recipe. It was very good- a tad spicy- but good. I think the next time I make it I will do slightly less curry powder and also add in some garam masala to give it a more Indian flavor. I just didn't think the curry powder alone added enough flavor. I am also going to try slowly adding the coconut milk in to avoid the very tiny white dots. My husband has done this with other Indian dishes he's made- slowly adding the yogurt and/or cream helped to eliminate the little tiny curdeling that happens. It doesn't taste any different it just looks more "professional" and appealing. Oh, I'm also going to add some golden raisins and cashews the next time around! Can't wait to make it again!

While this was a good dish, it wasn't a home run for me. My husband liked it a lot though. I would give it three stars and he would give it 5 stars...so I'll split the difference with 4.

Loved, loved, loved this! So good. Didn't quite use the whole two pounds of chicken and next time I will. I think that will make it even better - if possible. Oh and I did add a bit more tomatoes than it called for, because I like tomatoes. Thanks so much for sharing!

DH and I made this together the other night and it was delicious!  We severed it over rice with asparagus on the side and it made a lovely meal.  The leftovers re-heated were delicious too.  We will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I would not give this recipe 4.5 stars. It was pretty disappointing. This one just didn't taste good. Maybe it was too much tomato flavor and sugar. It was very simple to make so I give it 2 stars.
Im in still in search of a delicious curry recipe.

I personally would have given this recipe two stars. I personally did not like this. The recipe was simple to make. However, my husband who proclaims he hates coconut loved this chicken. Which is why i give it more stars. I suppose its all about preference!

I followed the recipe except I added 1.5 lbs of chicken, .5lb of potatoes, chopped ginger, and hot sauce . I let it cook for a little over an hour until the sauce was thick. After it was done I found it to be too sweet. I used unsweetened coconut milk and I only added 2 tbls of sugar. I tried everything to tone down the sugar but nothing worked. I will attempt to make this again with much less sugar and better quality curry powder. The traditional curry smell did not fill my home and I used 4 tbls of powder. My local grocery store doesn't carry international seasoning, but I will venture out to a Indian market next time.

I had boneless thighs, and diced tomatoes here. Sauteed the spices in the oil for several minutes, then added the onion and sauteed 'til translucent, then added chicken and sateed 'til cooked through as per another Indian reviewer suggested.
I added a bit more cumin and some garam masala to taste, and did the same with sugar, I'm sure it was less than 3T. This was so yummy we had it 2 nights in a row.

This was good!  The chicken was tender enough to cut with my fork!  I added some jalapeno pepper as suggested by another reviewer.  I only added 2 TBS of sugar, which was enough for me.

Update: I originally gave this 4 stars but I'm changing to 5 stars.  The dish is so much better the next day.  Everyone I served this to loved it!

Tried the original recipe as submitted.  Maybe good if you're not used to indian food.  The canned sauce and tomatos were just that - canned tomatos that overwhelmed the dish.

I made this for dinner today I followed the recipe and added some pineapple chunks, it taste fine aside from the curry powder I dont know, I found it so rough to eat, maybe my powder is not a good brand or something. and hubby said its sweet maybe because of 3tbsp of sugar and pineapple chunks is too much.

This is delicious! I use a 20 oz can of whole tomatoes instead of stewed, and don't add tomato sauce. It's really good with pork. Follow the advice about cooking the curry powder in the oil for a few minutes before adding anything else. I also add frozen peas, cauliflower, and red or orange peppers about 5 minutes before I'm ready to serve.

I love chicken curry, and I have 3 recipes that I inter-change. This, however, is now my favorite. My husband made it last night, and it was GREAT -full of flavor, just spicy enough, and healthy. What more could you ask for??? Thanks so much for sharing this recipe - we will make it again and again :-)

This was very good over jasmine rice. My partner LOVED it and said it's one of his new favorite dishes. I'd never cooked a curried dish before, so I was a little worried about messing it up, but it would honestly be pretty difficult to make a mistake here. This is already a pretty healthy dish, but I did slim it down a bit by using light organic coconut milk. It came out great!

I love Indian food and cook it relatively often. I initially made this as instructed and I found it bland and cloyingly sweet. I tried to rescue it with an inch of grated fresh ginger, some red pepper powder, and more garlic. We ate it, but no one in the house cared for it.

Wow!  This is so aromatic -- the taste is great, but if it turns out you don't like curry, a warning that the smell will remain for days unless you air out your house and turn the Central air unit off!  I was concerned about curry, as my kids don't usually like spicy food...but it turns out that this one is a keeper.  Here are my changes:  I only had 0.5 kg of chicken breast that I thinly sliced (that's just over 1 lb); I used 3 green onions instead of 1/2 a regular cooking onion; I used canola oil in place of vegetable oil...and I didn't reduce the amounts in the rest of the recipe.  It turns out there's a lot of liquid in there!  I served it over brown rice to soak up the juices.  My husband loved the sauce so much that he took out some bread and soaked up some more.  This is a highly recommended recipe for those who like a little variety.

This was outstanding!  I actually used bone-in, skin-on thighs.  After cooking the curry with the oil, adding the onion & garlic, then adding the tomato, I braised the thighs with the curry for about 20-30 minutes.  I then mixed the remaining ingredients and put the lid on to simmer for about an hour.  The chicken was done to perfection.  I topped with fresh cilantro and served over rice.  The family loved it!  Will be making again.  Next time I will add chunks of zucchini and sliced fresh mushroom.  I think I will also add pineapple chunks and add the juice in place of the sugar.

This curry has a nice flavor and we really enjoyed it.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used 2T of tomato paste & 1/2 cup water instead. I also had a couple carrots to use, so I chopped them and threw them in.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly & everything thickened up nicely, so no complaints here!  Served over jasmine rice and it was delicious! This would go great with steamed cauliflower on the side.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I followed other people's reviews and cooked the curry and oil for about 10 minutes, and then added the onion and cooked until translucent. I added some Jamaican Hot Peppers too. Added the chicken and cooked for 10 minutes and added the remaining ingredients. I simmered it for just over an hour and the chicken was soooo tender! My boyfriend said this was restaurant quality and he has very high standards!! I though this was very good. The sauce was a little too watery, so I did use some cornstartch at the end and it turned out nice (but a lot of sauce, so maybe next time I'll cut down on the wet ingredients a bit). I served it with "Zucchini and Potato Bake" and it was wonderful.

So yummy and it warms your tummy!  I used light coconut milk to decrease calories.  I also added some siracha hot sauce because I like my curry pretty spicy.  It was easy and turned out great!  For anyone on Weight Watchers:  Using the light coconut milk and serving with a 1/2 cup of brown rice, this recipe is only 7pts per serving!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly as written.  I did follow chef Stephanie's review and cooked the curry and oil for 5 minutes, added the onion and garlic, and then simmered until the onions were transluscent.  I also simmered the whole dish without a lid for about 50 minutes.  The sauce or gravy was thick and a rich red.  As I looked at the photos I think that those who cooked the curry and oil longer ended up with more of a red sauce and those that didn't ended up with more of a yellow gravy.  I loved the final result, and will certainly make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, there was just something off about the flavor.

I signed up for allrecipes just so I could review this! Of several recipes that I've made from this site, this one has been the BEST! I did add a few things that I had laying around, and it added a nice texture to the sauce. I added sliced carrots, diced potato, peas, and broccoli. I will absolutely be making this several more times! Yummm! :)

This is one of my favorite dishes on this site and I have made it dozens of times on 6 different stove tops. But I am giving the recipe 4 stars because I would not be as excited to make it the way it is written. The dish is only perfect (and therefore 5-star-worthy) after a considerable amount of changes. This is how I alter the Ingredients list: 1)I use 6 chicken breasts halves (or 3 breasts)  2) 2 teaspoons of salt  3) 4 TBS curry powder  4) 6 TBS brown sugar IF coconut Milk is unsweetened (and most are). (This may seem like a lot, but the sweetness is subtle) 5) 2 15oz cans of tomato sauce (I’ve made it with diced and the tomato taste was overpowering)  6) 2 medium potatoes, cubed and preboiled w/ a little bit of salt. This is how I alter the directions list: A) I follow another reviewer’s suggestion and heat curry powder in  skillet for 5 minutes, then another 10 minutes after onion/garlic are added (This is a MUST; it adds a beautiful spicy taste)  B) I add boiled potatoes in pan AFTER everything has been simmering for 15 minutes. I simmer for another 15 minutes)  I have made this with tomato paste many times as others have suggested, but have decided that it is too thick.   Serving suggestions: 1)It goes well with either jasmine or basmati rice (please, no Uncle Ben's) 2)It also tastes really good with spaghetti as an alternative to pasta sauce. I know that this sounds odd, but my sister-in-law (a very clever chef)put the leftover coconut curry with spaghetti once and i

I was very hesitant, but I did follow the recipe. Next time I'll: 

Double curry (I used 1/2 vindaloo curry and 1/2 regular yellow curry) instead of decreasing sugar.  Use less than half of the tomato sauce.  Chunks of tomatoes aren't in the least bit authentic, so next time I'll omit them completely.  I'd recommend adding  fresh sweet basil and a splash of fish sauce. Bamboo shoots and red peppers make this even more authentic.  

Whoever recommended cooking the curry into the oil first was brilliant.  It's an important step you shouldn't miss.

I'd say the recipe needs work.  You must taste it, and adjust the spices to your liking. If you're looking for a one dish curry chicken, it passes.  Since it's milder, kids probably will like it.  Not what I'd consider an "authentic" recipe, however.

I made this recipe as my first attempt ever at a curry.  I'd read some comments suggesting that it was too sweet, so I cut back the sugar to 1 T instead of 3.  I also added some fresh cilantro and some crushed hot pepper flakes because I like the heat.  I cooked the curry one day in advance and simmered the chicken in it for an hour before serving - I added some fresh red and yellow bell peppers along with the chicken.

When I made the curry (a day ahead) and gave it a taste test, I was very unhappy with the results.  Even after cutting out 2/3rds of the sugar, it was unpalatably sweet.  Having come this far though, I pressed on and put it in the fridge to eat the next day.  After adding the peppers and chicken, I was amazed at what a day's rest could do.  The flavours had mellowed a lot, blended together, and the overpowering sweetness was gone.

If you make this recipe, do it a day in advance!  It was GREAT the next day and went from a mistake to a tasty meal overnight.  I'll make this again.

We have been trying out different types of food, when I came to this recipe. Now, never having eatin' Indian food, this was good. I can't say pretty good cause I have not had anything to compare it to. I did add little red potatoes. My kids love potatoes. I have to admit though, I don't much like the odor of curry all through out my home, but might still cook this again. Thanks!

We loved this recipe! The 2tblsp of curry powder was perfect for us since my husband doesnt usually like curry and myself being pregnant, this didnt give me heart burn - it wasnt too spicy at all. I did change a couple of things though.. Instead of tomato sauce i used tomato paste and i also added 2 table spoons of heavy cream. The curry came out so creamy and not watery at all. I also used only 2 tblsp of sugar instead of 3. Delicious!

Like others I made a few modifications to fit what I had on hand: 2 # boneless pork loin-cubed, low-fat coconut milk, 1 small can each tomato sauce and paste. Plus I reduced sugar to 2 Tbs, cooked in a crock-pot on low for 10 hours, used a whole onion and stirred in a defrosted large bag of frozen baby peas just before we ate. Wonderful!

Delightful color, flavor and everyone had seconds. A keeper recipe, easy and quick and with the kids starting the rice cooker for me (sweet, short grain organic brown rice, yum), dinner was ready when I walked through the door.  The changes turned a great entrée into a wonderful one dish meal followed by fresh honeydew melon for desert

Wonderful! My friend who I made this for said "I have died and gone to Heaven!" The only changes I made was to use unsweetened coconut milk, and used partially drained Rotel tomatoes (with the peppers) for added kick. So tasty and will be making this many more times.

I love both Chicken and Coconut and this recipe looked good I added Tomato Sauce (ketchup)as i didnt have a can of Tomato sauce, followed the recipe up until covering and simmering I placed it all in a Casserole dish and added a good handful of rice this takes on all the flavours and makes the dish less runny I then put it in the oven gas mark 6 for 1 hour and it was fantastic

Even though I screwed this up a bit, it was still fabulous. I used too much tomato sauce and ended up adding sour cream to thicken it a bit. I also added more garlic (minced) and some red curry paste for a little extra kick.

We made two curry recipes from thid website and this one was the best! It was too sweet so next time I will do half as much sugar and we like spicy, so I added a tablespoon of red curry paste and the dish rocked our world!

This was a very flavorful dish that my husband and even 19 month old enjoyed.  It is excellent served over rice.  Personally, I would cut down on the amount of liquids added at the end, and bump up the amount of curry and garlic for a bit more spiciness.  But a very tasty meal.

Delicous!! Not spicy which is great for the family. I have made it twice in the last week. Great leftovers. I followed directions but used 2 TBSP. of sugar. Kept lid on while simmering for 20 min. then with lid off 20 min. Thickens right up. Great recipe!!! Served over rice and had steamed broccoli on the side with some naan bread from trader joes.

Deeee-lish! Only things I did differently were omitting all the sugar (used a teaspoon of it to only cut acidity of tomatoes) and used olive oil, not veg.  Really, this is one of the best recipes I've found on here...thanks, Roma!  And the pic of your baby boy is adorable too.

Not Bad.  I also omitted the tomato sauce.  I only used one tablespoon of sugar and 4 cloves of garlic.  I also used diced tomatoes and added a bit of dried celery powder and parsley.  I also used curry paste instead of powder. I think that the flavor is better.  Next time I will dice the onions instead of shredding them because I found it not to blend with the meat as well.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars I would!!! I make this dish all the time when we have company and people are always asking for the recipe.  I do make a few changes though:  We use chicken thighs as we prefer brown meat, I leave out the tomato sauce as some people have suggested, and I only use 2 TBPS sugar.  Also, and here's the key (at least for me!) I add a ton of salt at the end to taste.  I know, that's not really that good for you, but it really really makes a big difference...really brings out the flavors.  Serve it over jasmine or basmati rice with a nice salad and you'll love it!

Is it Indian or Carribean, all I can say is this is one terrific recipe!  I added sweet and maharaja curry powders and garlic to peanut oil, added the chicken, and wow! the beautiful golden color that chicken turns!  I then added onion, green/yellow pepper srips, and a handful of shredded carrot.  But the best part comes when you add the coconut milk (I used light) and tomatoes and sauce, it is a lovely pastel salmon orange.  I added a handful of frozen peas right before taking off the heat and served with basmati rice.  Thank you Roma!

This is very very yummy.  I added double the curry powder, about a tsp of cayenne and a little cumin.  I also added 2 large potatoes and a carrot.  It was so delicious!  Even better as leftovers!

I've made recipes off this site many times, and most of them have been good.  But this one was so good, I'm leaving my first review.  This recipe was unbelievable.  I only made two changes, both minor.  I added some lemongrass and crushed red pepper.  SO GOOD.

Lovely, although I think it's a crime to cook breast fillets for so long as they tend to dry out, a little less cooking time will be my option next time.

This was fantastic.  Very similar to what a restaurant serves here in Boulder.  The only changes I made was that I added thinly sliced carrots and sliced celery (both about 1/3 cup) with the onion.  However, I was out of onions and used a scallions instead.  I served this over an aromatic white rice that my brother gave me from Carolina.  It was perfect!  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was quick, simple and very good. I think it would also be good if substituted half of the chicken w/ shrimp.

I’ve made this according to the instructions dozens of times and it has never failed! This is an amazing recipe for first timers such as myself. We NEVER have leftovers it’s perfect just the way it is. I did pay attention to some of the reviews and I simmer the curry powder in olive oil to allow the flavor to release then add onions and slowly cook until translucent and holy cow it does make a difference. I will make this many many more times. A zillion thumbs up to the creator of this recipe!

Too much liquid, too much tomato. Doesn't taste like curry or coconut at all. Just tastes like tomato soup with chicken and veggies. As a tomato soup, it's decent, but that's not what I wanted at all. I'd skip the tomato sauce entirely and just use half the can of stewed tomatoes next time.

Absolutely Delicious! Not sure if this would be considered Indian or Thai, but I would say it rivals any similar dish served at the best of these restaurants around  here.  I followed the recipe as written, but used about half as much sugar (after tasting the sauce, 3 Tblsp. seemed a little too much).  I also added some cubed potatoes, carrots, and frozen peas to get in some veggies:) Served with basmati rice and simple cucumber salad. Perfect!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I don't cook with curry typically, but was looking for something different.  I cooked it on a night that I would not have to feed my son, because I was sure he would never eat a dish like this.  But to my surprise, he came home hungry with a friend and both boys loved this dish.  It is great on a cold night.

I made this as written with these changes: I added  a sliced carrot and a stalk of celery, sauteed after the onion (but before the chicken), and reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons (we like our curry hot and spicy; I used Penzey's hot curry powder as well). I served it over Jasmine rice.  It is delicious. There was leftover sauce, so I just made rice again the next day, heated the sauce and served over rice as a side dish.  Not a bit wasted.

Amazingly delicious! Followed the tip to cook the curry powder in the olive oil for at least 5 minutes, sautéed the onions for 10 mins and added chunks of potatoes and carrots as a filler. Yum! Thank you for the awesome, yet simple, recipe!

Loved it. Let it simmer for about 45 mins uncovered to thicken. Added two handfuls of salted cashews, really good addition. Next time I will add some red pepper while sautéing the curry powder with the onions to kick it up a notch.

I've made this several times and they always lick the plate clean! One of my kids has autism and serious sensory issues:  SHE LOVES IT! 
I followed the "most critical" review and did not add the tomato sauce. It was awesome.

I love this recipe. Its great as it is written or now that I've made it 1/2 a dozen times, I've improvised with adding shrimp, or red and yellow peppers or no stewed tomatoes and leave it creamy coconut. All that said...I should probably make it 5 star!

My fiancé and I love this dish.  We like our food spicy so we add in extra curry powder.  We have also made this with shrimp.  We make the sauce first and then add in the shrimp at the very end to avoid over cooking it.  Yummy!!

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  This created more sauce than normal which was really nice for dipping naan.  Whole family loved it and it was a nice change from the spicy curry we usually have.

As is, I give it 4 stars - great over rice.  Could use more curry and coconut flavor, along with a thicker sauce.  With modifications, I give it 5 stars: 2.5 lb chicken, 3 tbsp curry, lite coconut milk, tomato paste instead of sauce, drain stewed tomatoes; add 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 diced jalapeno, 1/8 cup crushed cashews, 1-2 tsp cornstarch; simmer uncovered.  Superb with modifications.  Kitchen will smell like curry for  days.  Serves well in a pita as leftovers, too.

Update two years later.  Simply wonderful.  Used Cook Stephanie's cooking method for the 'broth' and  Penzeys sweet curry.

Previous review: 2/16/14.  Excellent. Made as written except I did not have stewed tomatoes so I used diced. Loved it!

This dish served as the perfect opportunity to introduce my meat-and-potatoes loving, hillbilly husband to Indian food. Success! He chowed down on that stew like nobody's business and even took some to work. (I warned him about the, uh...pungent curry aroma that would linger around the break room when he reheats it at work, but he insisted!) I added a little extra onion and garlic, a bell pepper, three carrots, and three russet potatoes. I made sure everything was well-coated in the curry oil and sauteed them a good ten minutes before adding the chicken. Instead of the stewed tomatoes, I subbed with a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes since that's all I had. I used coconut milk from the carton (Kroger's Simple Truth Coconut Milk). For the curry, I used Penzey's Sweet Curry Powder. The sauce was too sweet for my liking when I tasted it halfway during the cooking process; I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup more of tomato sauce and a few splashes of coconut milk to balance it out. I was in a rush when I was making this, so I simmered it uncovered for around 45 minutes and the stew was perfectly thick. I'm sure the starch in the potatoes helped to thicken it out, too. Serve with rice and garlic naan and you've got yourself a rich, creamy, and comforting stew.

Yep def-get ur TK- down pat and its fabulous by TK I mean thardka... I'm white married to an wast Indian and have learned that the body if flavour is enhanced when its cooked into the oil---essentially homemade curried paste/oil...... And after I make my TK I often put it in a slow cooker with all the other things and eat it 4-6 hours later and it's less mess to clean after and full flavoured and enough to feed a small army or put in freezer bags and lay flat in the freezer for a crazy busy day or sudden company!

Overall, this is a great recipe. We made it exactly as printed, and it was good, but for my personal taste, I would make a few slight alterations: I'd leave out the tomato sauce, decrease the sugar to 1-2 Tbls, and add a flour/water slurry (1/8 cup flour to 3/4 cup water, shaken in a jar before addition). The flour/water slurry thickens this up a bit. Also, I enjoyed adding a bit of cayenne pepper to my serving to heat it up! We'll definitely make this again, though!

I really liked this recipe...it has a subtle sweetness and I love the creaminess that the coconut milk creates. I tweeked a couple of things however...I did not use any sugar because coconut milk already has a subtle sweetness and I read some reviews that stated that this recipe was a bit too sweet...so I believe that omitting the sugar was a good move. 

The coconut milk I used is just labeled "Coconut milk" it does not state that it is sweetened or unsweetened...that was one thing I was confused about when I tried this recipe. Also...I read reviews saying that the sauce was a bit runny, so instead of using tomato sauce I used 4 oz of tomato paste..I think that the end result was perfect...just enough to make it saucy and slightly thick..great for pouring over white rice! 

I also added a little bit more curry for depth and a bit of extra garlic! The key with the garlic is to MASH it...not just merely chop it up. Doing this really brings out more of the garlic flavor. We served this recipe with garlic butter pita wedges to sop up the sauce...It was very comparable to my favorite dish at a local Indian restaurant and I believe the leftovers will taste even better tomorrow night. Also...a word about the curry smell...yes it lingers in the house for awhile...but I don't find it offensive, I actually like the fragrant aromas of the spices. :-)   Good luck with this!

I made a few unintentional changes, but I can still tell the base recipe is a winner for us. My only criticism is that it needed more salt for us. I used extra firm tofu (NOT silken style!!!) rather than chicken. I also added one leftover baked potato I had in the fridge, just to use it up. I had the oil too hot the first time I cooked the curry and burned it (EW!), so I didn't have enough for the second batch; so I used half the curry and filled the rest with turmeric and garam masala, then went to the store and bought more curry powder, so I really had the full amount of curry, PLUS the garam masala and extra turmeric. Gave it extra flavor, which is important for bland proteins like tofu and chicken. I cooked the curry and onions in a skillet, then moved it all to a crockpot and cooked on high two hours. I made a double batch for a party and served it with steamed rice.

I made it this weekend and everyone LOVED it. It was scrumptious. I added 50g of ground cashew nuts to thicken the sauce and some cayenne pepper as the curry powder I used is pretty mild. I served it with some broccoli and basmati rice. A winner! It actually tasted better the following day. I will make more soon!

OMG, this was delicious! Although my ingredients were the same, I can't say I followed the recipe. I'm a huge slow cooker fan, so I threw everything in for an easy meal. I did use curry paste, Patak's mild, available at World Market stores. For me, I like a lot of curry and don't mind heat, so I added about three tablespoons to a frying pan with the sliced onions and some oil first. Believe it or not, frozen chicken breasts cook up much more tender and juicier in the crock pot than not frozen, so that's what I always use. I only had light coconut milk, but I don't notice a difference. Like most users, I skipped the tomato juice and just used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes. To add to the tomatoey flavor without having to waste a whole can of tomato paste I added a tbsp or so of ketchup when I sautéed the onions and curry paste. About an hour before serving, I removed chicken, cooled and shredded it, then added some frozen peas and a can of diced green chilies. I think this would be good using up really any leftover/frozen/clean-out-the-fridge vegetables you can find. I served it over brown rice. My one year old and I had enough to last us a few dinners, and she loved it!

This was really excellent. Based on other reviews (and the advice of an Indian friend), I did prepare the curry by cooking it in the oil alone for about 5-7 minutes, then added onion and garlic and cooked until translucent (about 10 minutes). Then the stewed tomatoes for about 2 minutes, THEN added the chicken and cooked until juices run clear.  Because we are trying to only get carbs through veges, I added 1 coarsely chopped red and green pepper, about 1.5 cups of whole baby carrots, and about 2 cups of frozen mixed veges. Instead of rice, I poured finished mixture over steamed broccoli florets - no rice whatsoever.  It. Was. AWESOME!!  REALLY, REALLY DELICIOUS!  This will definitely become a staple in our low-carb household!!

A couple of changes earned raves for this already-great recipe.  I followed another review's suggestion to start with a fragrant roux-like combination of the oil, curry paste, garlic and onions.  After the onions were fully caramelized, I spooned that mixture into a crock pot and added coconut milk and crushed tomatoes.  That all simmered for 4+ hours on high.  In the meantime, I cubed the skinless/boneless chicken breasts and... here's the twist... coated them with a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs (1 cup), herbs, salt, pepper, and flour (1/2 cup).  Those cooked in an oiled baking pan, in a 350-degree oven for 25 minutes.  This precooked chicken doesn't need to go into the curry until maybe 15-30 minutes before serving.   This was all served over brown rice... which itself was prepared using chicken broth in place of water, and I added a lot of turmeric and a little salt to it.  This was plenty of food for 10 very satisfied people.

This was just a touch sweeter than I anticipated so I might dial that back a bit next time. Or I might use brown sugar -- there's another curried chicken with coconut recipe on here that uses brown sugar that comes out sweet and I love the sweetness. Odd how that works. Anyway, used light coconut milk and had to simmer it the last 30 minutes with the top off to get it to thicken. I knew that would happen with using light coconut milk, so I was prepared for it. Thanks for sharing your recipe -- we liked this :)

Great recipe. I used curry paste instead of he powder. 4 garlic cloves. I didn't use the sugar or the tomato sauce; still was great.

What amazing flavor this dish had!   It tasted just like the version I get at a nearby Thai restaurant, which is what I was looking for.  Instead of chunks of chicken, I just thinly sliced 3 chicken breasts.  I cut down on the fat a bit and used only 1 Tbl. oil.  Instead of thinly sliced onions, I chopped them to make the sauce thicker.  I thought 2 Tbl. curry sounded like a lot, but I added it as written, and was so glad I did!  I forgot to season the breasts with salt and pepper at the beginning, so I just added 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper while simmering.  After reading other reviews, I cut the sugar in half, and was very glad I did!  I ended up adding another 1/2 tsp. salt at the end.  You might want to add some crushed red pepper while the sauce is simmering, if you want to give it some spice.  I served this dish over basmati rice, and spooned some sauce on top of fresh steamed broccoli.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I've made this several times and absolutely love it.  Over cauliflower "rice" or actual rice, it's a hit with everyone.  I ran out of my chunky curry mix and this just isn't the same with the curry powder I have now, but it's still delicious!

Just tried this recipe and we all loved it. I must say I will make this again and again. Although next time I will only use half the amount of coconut milk and maybe more curry. Btw I used curry paste vs powder as suggested in one of the reviews. Bravo!

This is soooo good! I just finishing making this, followed recipe pretty exact. I didn't add the tomatoe sauce per the other reviews but I did added a little more curry, put in red pepper flakes and used rotel instead of tomatoes. My husband is eating  this now and he's steady saying "This is so good, I just got to have a little more." I also poured in a package of Kroger Stir Fry Vegetable & Rice . This is definitely easy and a keeper.  I love trying new  and easy reciepe and they come out tasting so good.

I put some potato cubes in it, and way more curry powder, but less tomato sauce. Served with rice and chopped green onion on top, perfect!

Turned out I had the ingredients on hand already to make this dish, so not having to hit the grocery store on a rainy Saturday was a real plus. I pretty much made this as written, but I had a red bell pepper that was approaching its final days of usefulness so I sliced it up and added it in along with the coconut milk, diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. It was a tasty and colorful touch.

Alas, it turned out I did NOT have all the ingredients on had to make this as the can of tomato sauce I thought I had was actually another can of diced tomatoes. I substituted 8 oz of my husband's Pizza Quick Sauce (the man eats like a child, what can I say?) and then skipped the added sugar to compensate for it being sweeter than canned tomato sauce.

The recipe was easy to follow and quite delicious, with plenty of leftovers for another dinner. Will most definitely make this one again.

I used lite coconut milk, 1 tbsp oil, and 1.5 tbsp sugar, as well as adding 1 eggplant.  Was delicious!!  Would make again (used 3 chicken breasts, may use 4 next time).

Good but BLAND. Needs to at least double the curry. Used fire roasted diced tomatoes & no tomato sauce (what I had) & leftover turkey.

Yum! It's about time I gave this a try... and for good reason. This was EXCELLENT!!! I usually make slight modifications to most new recipes I try, but felt no need to this time. Other than subbing a can of diced tomatoes for stewed ones (it's what I had in my pantry), I made no "real" changes. I also didn't alter the cooking method. My curry was plenty thickened after simmering (covered) on medium heat for 35 minutes. I was afraid it wouldn't be, but it was perfect. YOU DON'T NEED TO SIMMER UNCOVERED TO ACHIEVE A THICK CURRY!!! Who wants to have sauce splattered all over their stove anyways (this is the main reason I didn't simmer uncovered). I have a couple of final observations. First, Chef Joy advised to not use unsweetened coconut milk in this. After researching on the Internet, I found that most coconut milks on the market ARE unsweetened (I couldn't find a name brand one that wasn't) and all are suited for curries. The sugar and sweetness of the tomatoes are spot on. Adding sweetened coconut milk would make this dish REALLY sweet. Second, the flavor of your curry HIGHLY depends on the type of curry powder you use (i.e. hot / sweet, Thai / Indian, etc.). My curry was on the sweeter side because I used a mild / sweet one. Served over Jasmine rice with naan on the side. Not only was this a really good meal, it's another one my hubs and I both agree on. :-) Thanks for sharing, Roma!

Very good! I put in about 3 TBL curry powder and will try 4 next time. Also, I did make a butter and flour rue to mix in at the end to thicken it up. Definately needs to be served over a good rice, like basmati.

Very good basic recipe. I use Quorn chikn (to make it vegetarian), add another TBS curry, and use less tomato sauce. This has become one of our regular dinners.

Yum!  This was a big hit with my kids.  I added a bit of crushed red pepper since it really seemed like a dish that could use some heat - only about 1/2 teaspoon gives it a nice kick but I'm a wimp and I could totally handle it.  Here's my tip for helping the mixture to cook down and thicken.  Don't cover the pan while it is simmering AND simmer it longer.  If you leave the lid off, it will cook down and thicken much better than if you leave the lid on.  I will definitely make again!

Kids: 9 and 11 loved this!  Personally, I'd prefer more curry taste.  Will add 3Tbsp curry paste next time.  I used unsweetened coconut milk the 3tbsp sugar called for and it was perfect for us.

This was sooo good and so easy to make.  I didn't have an 8oz can of tomato sauce or diced stewed tomatoes, so instead I used two 14.5oz of plum tomatoes which I pureed with a hand blender because our family does not like chunks of cooked tomatoes.  I was a bit worried that that would make the sauce too thin or to "tomatoey," but it was perfect.  The chicken was perfectly tender, not dry and we look forward to using some of the leftover sauce with scallops and shrimp.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I cook curry almost everyday but this is one of my fave! Next time though,  I'll add more curry powder as I love strong curry flavor! I added some potatoes into this curry stew and it was fantastic!

Out of all the curry recipies I've tried, this is by far the best! I added some extra curry paste and chili oil to make it spicier but the flavor was really good! I also added green beans. Made numerous times and it was always delicious! Definately should allow it to simmer for at least 1 hour.

Absolutely amazing, the best curry recipe I have made! I loved it and so did my husband. I would add less sugar next time or use fresh tomatoes. Somehow the canned tomatoes and paste bring more sweetness.

Wonderful recipe, perfect as is.  However I excluded the tomato sauce in lieu of 2 tablespoons ketchup.  I just didn't want that much tomato influence in the dish.  Also I used McCormick brand red curry powder.  Love that curry powder.  Again, great dish, wonderful.

The dish turned out very delicious. So easy to make and so much flavor !!! The only change I made is I added 1 extra tsp of curry powder and 1/4 cup fresh basil. Served with white rice.

Wonderful curry! I made it vegetarian by replacing the chicken with cauliflower, bell pepper, and sweet potato. I also used 4T. tomato paste and no tomato sauce or stewed tomatos.

Really great recipe.  The only thing I noticed with the written version of this recipe is that it does not include with or without an option to add "chillies" which I noted from the video that Roma had said she did add for extra heat.  Other than that and I love the "heat" it was really a great recipe.

Very tasty, but needs a bit of spicing up. Jalapeños maybe, and a bit more garlic as other reviewers have suggested should make this a definite 5 star recipe. Serve over basmati rice.

Absolutely brilliant dish.  I made it exactly per the directions, and the result was just as good as the coconut-curry chicken I had at a roadside dinner, deep in the heart of Belize.  This is going into regular rotation for my home dinner menu!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I did not add the sugar. For me, the sugar would have made it way too sweet and I don't care for sweet entrees. Otherwise I made it exactly as written using unsweetened coconut milk and simmering uncovered for about an hour. I will certainly make this again but maybe with a bit more curry powder. Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe.

This was very good .   I used Caribbean curry powder instead of Indian curry powder because that's what I had on hand.  I'll try it with Indian curry powder next time I make it and add some veggies and raisins.

I liked this recipe. My husband wasn't a big fan (it's quite coconutty). One thing to note: as with most curries, cooking this will make your house smell like Indian food for days. In our house, at least, we couldn't stop smelling it for an entire weekend, which is great unless you're having a ton of people over. :)

Easy, Yummy, smells awesome!! 
Made this exactly as written and all my kids loved it over basmati rice with steamed cauliflower on the side. My 7 year old is quite picky and I was really worried my 3 year old would not go for it - but they ate it up! My hubby ate two plates!
*I did find it didn't thicken up as much as I wanted even letting simmer with the lid off and about an hour; so used a tsp potato flour and cold water and it thickened right up -- next time I'll make earlier and add a small can of tomato paste and just let it cook longer.

Awesome*****

This is pretty good! I added some extra granulated garlic to the sauce as well as a tsp of Garam Masala for extra flavor. I did have to thicken the sauce up with a cornstarch slurry - but that was no big deal. Will make again!

Made this tonight exactly as written, with the exception of a couple shakes crushed red pepper toward the end of cooking.  Served it with Basmati rice and some gluten free flat bread that I baked on a pizza stone on the grill.  This is a really good curry.  I think my curry powder is old.  I'm going to buy some more and make this again for sure.

I gave it 4 stars because it's good I just don't like it much. I made it exactly how the recipe stated. It was too tomatoee and not so much curry like. If I make again I would use a different curry or add lots more. And if your wondering I did use a fresh bottle of curry. It seemed to have curry flavor till I cooked the liquid till thick then the flavor went away.

I *love* this recipe! I use a custom blend of curry powder from a local spice shop. I made it before and I also had an issue with it being too liquidy. There is a simple solution: just take the lid off the pan during the cooking time and let it cook down. Perfect!

Follow the recipe to the letter.  I think it should be made with sweetened coconut milk. I used mild curry powder and this was flavorless.  But I noticed that others commented on how bland it was.  I agree with the other reviewer who suggested the curry, onions and spices cook for much longer before adding anything else to it.  I would also add a second can of tomatoes.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was good, but we added about 1/2 TBSP more curry at the end because I couldn't taste the curry at all. I'd definitely add more curry next time and some red pepper to give it a bit more bite. Probably could cut back on the sugar too - it was sweet.

i used 6 tbsp of curry powder instead of 2 and it was delicious. however, even with the additional curry, it's more like a korma than a curry. great for a korma, though!

This was amazing! I had a can of coconut milk to use up' and this was perfect. I didn't use the sugar though. Just personal preference. Thank you so much! This is a keeper!

I made this twice... once on the stove top and once in the slow cooker. i loved this in the slow cooker!!! I added a bit of garam masala and xtra coconut milk. I barely used any tomato sauce, because i felt the dish did not need as much acid. I cannot imagine topping this dish off with anything but fresh cilantro. The flavors went perfect together!!!  One more note, I did remove the sauce from the crock pot and simmered it on the stove just to thicken it up a bit!!

YUM! This was delicious.  The chicken was very tender.  I simmered for almost an hour. I didn't use canned coconut milk which I think was a mistake.  The coconut flavor was not as strong as I would have liked.

Good! Wanted a thick curry sauce so I used tomato paste in place of sauce.  Everything else was to recipe.  We enjoyed it very much.  I think I'll put some vegetables in it next time (like maybe cauliflower?) for some different texture.

This was so good. I left out sugar, used 3 Tblsp Maharajah curry powder, chicken quarters, added 2 seeded and fine chopped jalapenos, a cup or so chicken broth and cooked in oven at 325 for 2 hours. I also followed suggestion and cooked curry powder 5 min then added chopped onion (whole onion), 10 oz sliced mushrooms and cooked until translucent. then added the coconut milk and rest and poured over chicken. I served it with wild rice and was very yummy.

Eh...I've had this saved for awhile and got excited to try tonight just for me. I didn't like the results so much because I couldn't find the "savory" taste I was hoping for and couldn't get pass the pungent smell of the curry. I've had better curry dishes than this. Thank you anyway.

I thought this was awesome.  A few things I altered to our taste was to only add 1 tbsp. of sugar.  I also used red curry paste instead of powder.  After the chicken had been cooking for a couple minutes, I added a julienned red pepper. Didn't have trouble thickening, but simmered uncovered for almost an hour.  Served over basmati rice with a squeeze of lime juice, a few sliced scallions, cilantro and a few chopped cashews.  YUM!!  My husband asked to have this added to the "rotation"! Thanks for a great recipe:)

Excellent!  Used light coconut milk and added some extra curry.  Simmered for an hour and it was still thin but the brown rice i had it over soaked it up.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! It is SO easy to make and so delicious! I make it regularly and get fantastic reviews when I do. To make it even easier, I use regular diced tomatoes instead of stewed, diced tomatoes. And I also add cayenne pepper while cooking to give it an added kick. Try this recipe! You WON'T be sorry!!!

Definitely different. My husband says 4.5 stars. I don't think I've ever had curry before - so I'm not sure if this taste was similar but it seemed like it should be spicier. I definitely needed at least 1 tblsp more of oil while cooking the curry and vegetables to be able to coat the chicken. I followed the suggestion of cooking the curry for 5min on own, then vegs for about 10min before adding the chicken. I'm always using what I have on hand so I used tomato paste instead of sauce which I figured would be fine with the other reviews and needing to lessen liquid. Also only had cream of coconut - so only used half can of this and left out the sugar. It did have to simmer longer than stated (will try without lid on next time). Did add 1tblsp of cornstarch in 2 tblsp of water in end to thicken. Very unique flavor that I have never had before but will definitely be making again!

This was absolutely delicious! very easy and cheap to make, and served it over warm basmati rice. My boyfriend loved it because it didn't have an overwhelming curry flavor which is good, because sometimes that can ruin a dish. very mild yet delicious flavors. also the sauce thickened up nicely after about 25-30 minutes of simmering..totally worth the wait! I will certainly be making this again, maybe with some crushed red pepper flakes for a little bit of heat. Thank you!

Excellent recipe.  I have made this recipe many times in my household and it is a huge hit.  My suggestion to this recipe would be to add more vegetables such as potatoes, and carrots to your liking.  Also I like to cube the chicken, cook it in oil and season it with the curry powder as it is cooking.  Other than that it is a great recipe and you can't go wrong making it.

We really liked this. I was a little leery of that much curry powder, since we are not spicy food people, but it was fine. There is no such thing as tomatoes that are both stewed and diced, at least not at any store I've ever shopped at, but I used stewed and broke them up with a spoon to make them more bite-sized. I might just use petite diced tomatoes next time. I also used light coconut milk; it seemed to have no effect on the final outcome. My only complaint is that it was a little soupy after 40 minutes of simmering. This recipe is a keeper.

This is my very first time attempting to cook a curry dish, and it was a huge hit.  I followed Cook Stephanie's advice on letting the curry cook a little longer before adding the rest of the ingredients.  My husband basically ran up to the counter for seconds.  I love the tomato base and hint of coconut flavor...nothing in this dish is overpowering.    Just a word of precaution - my apartment smelled like curry for days, so I'm a little hesitant to make this dish too frequently.

Great recipe for a curry base. Family, including very picky kids loved it. I modified slightly by using light coconut milk, added .5 TBS of Garam Masala, cooking uncovered, draining excess water from the tomatoes before adding, and adding some frozen peas when I added the coconut milk.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it needs some spicy kick added as an option to the recipe. I would probably also leave out the tomato sauce as I'm not sure it is needed.

Loved this recipe.  I followed the suggestion of another and simmered it uncovered and it thickened up nicely.  It was a little bit sweet for my taste so I plan on halving the sugar next time.

Should have read the reviews before cooking. Thought about straining the tomatoes but went with the recipe. Was soupy took a while to thicken up.

This is my first ever recipe rating and I could not let this excellent recipe go without recognition.  This recipe was finger lickin' good!  I modified the recipe by throwing all ingredients in a baking dish and baking for an hour and a half or so.  YUMMY is all I can say; even my picky kids loved it.  Not to mention how fabulous the house smells.  I will add this one to the recipe books to pass down to family for years to come.

Easy and tasty recipe.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  Adding cornstarch definitely gave the sauce a heartier thickness.  I will probably use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce next time.  It's a keeper, though!

I added potatoes and carrots to the dish. I used canned chopped tomatoes ( not stewed) and cooked the curry in the oil for a few minuets like the others suggested. I used light coconut milk from trader joes. I don't have anything to compare this to since I rarely eat curry, but man this was good!! I served this with brown rice. This had plenty of spice, I didn't need to add any extra heat. All curry powders are not created equal so check before you add any more spice.

YUM YUM YUM!  We loved it.  I was a bit scared about having coconut being that it is such a strong flavor, however, I was very pleasantly surprised at how perfect this dish is.

Total hit at my house! My husband demands that I make this every week! I've used this simple recipe as a basis for my red and green curry, with pork, chicken, or potatos as well. Everyone loves it!

I doubled the amount of curry powder and the end result was still a bland curry.  I added 1T of salt and 1t of pepper for taste which made it better, but the curry was still lacking something.  Five stars for the ease of cooking, but I'll have to play around with this one to get the right curry flavor.

This was quite good and my family enjoyed it.  I served it over rice and with zucchini.  I also put red pepper flakes and hot sauce on the table for people to add according to their own tastes.  I also left my shaker of curry powder out for people who wanted more to add.  The kids left it alone, while the adults had fun spicing it up.  This recipe also makes for great leftovers!  Thanks!

This is pretty good.  I now agree with other reviewers that the entire can of tomato sauce is too much.  Also, the recipe doesn't say to drain the can of tomatoes (but I did).  It still comes out pretty "soupy" and I imagine the photo that is posted was of the chicken taken from the pot with a slotted spoon.  I added a few squirts from the tube of tomatoe paste in the fridge to try to thicken it up a bit.  The flavor is pretty one-note and needs something else.  Next time I will experiment with ginger or lemon pepper or something.  I only put one T of curry and 2T of sugar and still the curry was too prominent (thus the one-note flavor).  With that said, I'll try again with more broad flavor options.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as instructed except I used a little less sugar (nervous it would be too sweet) and I used lite coconut milk.  Oh, and I mixed in a few tablespoons of corn starch towards the end of the cooking time to thicken up the sauce.  We paired it with "Carrot Rice" (also delicious).  My husband and I love curry, and even our 4-year-old daughter and 9-month-old son ate it!

Yum. This was my first attempt at cooking with Curry.  I wasnt sure what to expect. The flavor was more subtle than I expected. I think next time I wont add as much sugar as it was a bit too sugary for me.  My husband LOVEd it and ate two bowls.

This was my first time cooking with curry and OH MY GOD did it turn out delicious.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it uncovered for about an hour, to help thicken the sauce.  Also, I added canned pineapple and green pepper pieces while simmering, and then a few more pieces as it was almost finished.  The pineapple gave it a great sweet and hot flavor.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!!!!

Very good and easy.  I found that I could do with less coconut milk -- about 3/4 of a can.  I also added potatoes and carrots, boiled beforehand.  The tomato sauce is important to the flavor, as it adds a bit of tartness.

Good, I took a bit more time with the onions and curry powder, threw in a few chili peppers and added a little lime juice, went down very well with the hungry vermin who haunt my house. (i.e. my housemates). Four stars given, as I think it could be improved with a few more spices and ingredients. (Fresh coriander would have been lovely, sadly I had run out) I made this with cumin, turmeric and pea basmati rice (Fry cumin seeds in oil until they start to make little popping noises, throw in a tsp or so of turmeric and fry for a minute, then peas (frozen are fine) until warmed up. Toss in your uncooked Basmati rice, fry in the oil for a few minutes, and then add 1.5 times as much water. Make sure your heat is medium low to low, salt to taste, cover for about 15 mins) You get a lovely, delicately flavoured yellow rice.

Very good! I used Thai curry paste & let cook for about 5 mins with the oil. Then I added the onions & garlic & let that cook for another 5 mins or so, then I added the chicken to cook. I also added a bit of chili powder & red cayenne pepper for a bit more kick. I used one can of diced tomatoes (not stewed) and I used unsweetened coconut milk. It was quite liquidy so I left out the can of tomato sauce. I also added some frozen broccoli which tasted great with this! I thickened the sauce up just a bit with some corn starch. Overall, I thought it was really good & I would make it the exact same way again. I was concerned that I bought the unsweetened coconut milk but I found that it left this dish with a hint of sweetness which I really enjoyed. I did end up adding an extra TBSP of sugar just to make sure it was sweet enough as I was uncertain. I think had it been any sweeter I may not have liked it as much so it ended up being perfect for me! I just made with white rice & it was great!

I can only give this 4 stars because I felt the two types of tomato products (diced/sauce) overpowered the dish.  I also thought 3 Tbs. sugar was too much for this recipe.  I would have loved to have more of the coconut flavor stand out with the curry instead of so much tomato. This dish was easy to make and prepare.  I would deifinitely make it again, but probably leave out the juice of the diced tomatoes and maybe add some unsweetened shredded coconut to the final dish along with additional coconut milk while cooking.

I've made this a couple of times and a couple of different ways.  I agree, as written it can be a little bland and a little sweet but you have to know your ingredients.  Curry will loose it's flavor quickly on your shelf.  Buy fresh spices!  If you want a good curry don't buy it at a grocery store.  Decide what characteristics you want and go to an ethnic grocery.  Too Sweet? Add the sugar last.  Sugar doesn't change flavor as you are cooking.  Put in a little at a time and taste.  Sauce doesn't thicken? Take the lid off and cook it.  I use a hot Madras Curry, season with fish sauce, use fresh tomatoes and put it on a Jasmine or Basmati Rice.  Mild Safeway Curry, Spaghetti Sauce and Ramen Noodles are not going to make it.

This was really good, the only thing I did differently was used tofu instead of chicken. Definitely marinate the tofu and cook it separately, otherwise it's a little to "tofo-ish".

Very tasty, and easy to make.  I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch all week.  It was uncomfortably spicy for me (perhaps because I used curry paste instead of curry powder), so I mixed in some plain yogurt - perfect!  Frozen peas are a great mix-in, too!

this tasted nothing like curry but i still rated it a 5 because it was so good. i followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect. i will for sure make this over and over. it tasted more like a tomato soup chicken with a hint of curry. maybe next time i will either 86 the tomato sauce or cut down on it. amazing though!!!

Was pretty good, a little bland so I added some more curry powder and cooked it for a few more minutes.  Added some honey too for an additional level of flavor.

Great curry recipe to start with; it's very easy to follow, and tastes great! I followed some other readers' advice with cooking the curry first before adding the onions, and with letting the broth simmer with the lid uncovered. I also added other vegetables (depends on what is in my fridge, but I've added mushrooms, broccoli, and even eggplant and it's turned out fine); the vegetables are added after the chicken is more or less cooked, and before the coconut milk and tomatoes are added. I also have experimented with adding some ground ginger, paprika, cinnamon, ground red pepper, and red pepper flakes to create a more intense flavor with good success. Also discovered that this curry freezes well (which is perfect for a busy college student; I like to make a large batch at once, then freeze 1-2 serving portions in ziplock bags for later use)

Absolutely wonderful!!! I added about a tablespoon of Garam Masala because I had it on hand. Served it with my own easy coconut rice...Cooked Jasmine rice per instructions on the bag and at the end I tossed in a handful of sweetened, flaked coconut. This was "to die" for. Thank you ROMA for sharing!!!

5 stars- It's so easy to make and it's so good!  I doubled the curry powder, added 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 head cauliflower and red pepper flakes and served over jasmine rice.  Will definitely make this again!

3 stars - I made this a 2nd time and it wasn't as good as I remembered it.  I'd give it 3 stars instead of 5 and I made it the exact same way.

This was so amazing!  I couldn't imagine it tasting any better!  I used mild curry paste instead of the curry powder and more than it called for, about a Tablespoon of tomato paste instead of the sauce, and extra salt and pepper.  I think the tomato paste allowed it to thicken beautifully and in was less time than what the other reviewers said.  I think it was only like 35 minutes.  This was delicious, and whoever said it would be hard to screw this one up is right!

After reading many reviews on this dish stating it is bland, I think I may have figured out the problem.  At the grocery store I found three different types of curry powder - Curry Powder, Spicy Curry Powder and Red Curry Powder.    I did the following and found the flavors of the dish were very well balanced as did others who ate it last night:  used 2 1/2 T Spicy Curry Powder, 1 whole medium onion, and only 1 T sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Oh, and I did simmer it uncovered for approximately 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  I thought it was very good.  I served it with brown rice, but will probably use white or jasmine next time.

I made this dish tonight and it was pretty good. my husband and stepdaughter both liked it. I had never made curry before and didn't know it was so easy. Followed the recipe to a T and it was too sweet.  Will cut the sugar in half next time and maybe add some peas and potatoes.

This was absolutely delicious! One of the best recipes I have made in a while. I made half the recipe with chicken and half with firm tofu. I separated the curry/oil/onion/garlic mixture into two pans and put a pound of chicken into one and half a package of drained tofu into the other. Then I just divided the rest of the ingredients between the two pans and treated each the same. It was wonderful! Served with basmati rice and peas. Thanks so much!

This was pretty good.  Next time I would probably half the curry.  We also thought it needed something extra so we added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  The main reason we probably won't make this a lot is that it leaves quite a strong smell in the house.  We are on day 5 after making this and we can still smell curry in the house.

This was amazing! I left out tomatoes and tomato sauce, because I'm allergic to them, but even so it turned out really great. I'm sure I'll make it again sometime!

This was just okay. Not the best curry I have ever had. Overall, I thought it was a bit on the bland side, but it does serve as a good base.

Doubled recipe, but only used 4 chicken breasts. Used honey instead of sugar, used the juice of the canned tomatoes and added about 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables.  Simmered for 2 hours on the stove uncovered. Also threw in a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Will likely make again, but maybe will add a bit more curry powder.

My husband and I really liked this dish!  I followed the recipe except I only had half a can of coconut milk so I opened a can of coconut cream and used half of that as well.  I did drain the can of tomatoes as another reviewer suggested.  It was great!  Not too hot, a subtle coconut flavor leaning more towards curry.  I'll make this again.

This was my 1st attempt at anything with curry.  It was a great recipe to start with.  The only problem I had was that after simmering for about 45 minutes, the chicken was so dry I threw it out.  I did take the rest of the sauce and finish my rice with it. When I made it a second time, I browned the chicken, took it out, simmered the sauce for about 30 minutes with the onion and garlic then added the chicken back for another 10 minutes.  Came out PERFECT!

I adapted this recipe to a vegan version and used Trader Joe's Beefless strips instead of chicken. I also added quartered red potatoes and carrots. I omitted the diced tomatoes and used light coconut milk instead of regular. I served this over saffron rice. It was literally mouth watering!

This is a very good & easy base recipe.  I did reduce the sugar by half to suit my husbands taste.  And I used mild Rotel for the canned tomato part.  The curry itself tastes good.  We did feel the chicken was on the blander side.  We are Indian and prefer more spice.  Will try to tweak by marinating the chicken next time.

This was pretty good.  It's not a recipe I'd use often but it wasn't bad.  I added a green bell pepper and more spices because by itself it was bland.  Not sure if I'll make this again.

This is a marvelous template. I use this as the base for my own signature curry chicken. I add ginger, soy sauce, cumin, cloves, red pepper, a splash of cinnamon and chopped habernaro peppers. I also add about a half a can of tomato paste mixed with water, sugar and a little garlic, this way I can determine the flavor of my sauce instead of someone else. My husband is gone for work about 6 months out of the year and this is one of the token meals he expects when he returns home. Thank you for the recipe.

Ohhh maannn!  WOW this is something!  Everyone stuffed themselves this was amaaazing!  I added the curry powder to olive oil and stirred for 5 minutes, then added onions and sauteed for another 5 minutes, then garlic for another 5...and then followed the recipe exactly.  "When cooking curry take your time letting the flavors marry" is the advice I receive from my Indian and Indo-Guyanese friends.  Thanks so much Roma for a keeper =)

This was my first attempt at making curry and it turned out sooooo good!  The only changes I made were adding carrots and potatoes and simmering it 20 minutes with the lid on and 20 minutes with it off.  The sauce thickened up beautifully!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe to experiment with.  I also added twice as much curry powder and another 1 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I also agree, it was too soupy.  I took the lid off to omit some of the liquid and also needed to add a little cornstarch.  I didn't even add the stewed tomatoes, just the tomato sauce and coconut milk.  I used lite coconut milk, next time I would use regular.

We LOVE this recipe!  I followed the advice of a lot of reviewers, I toast my curry in oil then add the onions/garlic and saute for five minutes before adding my chicken.  I always add par-boiled diced potatoes and sometimes carrots.  I let everything simmer for about an hour and never have a problem with the sauce being too thin, probably because of the potato starch.  THIS IS SO DELICIOUS!  I've made it at least twice a month for the last two years.

I've been trying different versions of chicken curry dishes and so far this is the family favorite. It's got just the right amount of heat and good flavor. Tastes even better the next day! I used hot curry powder, left out the chopped tomatoes (didn't have any), and cut the sugar from 3 to 2 tbls. Thanks!

This was fantastic! I followed the advice below and let the "broth" cook longer than indicated in the recipe; after such a delicious meal, I'm not sure I'd try it any other way. We ate our chicken over rice, which absorbed the sauce (there was a good amount.) Garnished with shredded coconut, this is something I will make again soon.

I absolutely love this recipe. This was  actually the first salty dish I've ever made and my parents thought I had a gift for cooking! The curry is creamy and of perfect texture. The coconut spices the whole dish up!                                                                              
My recommendations: If you're not sure what kind/brand of curry to use: Try McCormicks. I love their curry! Any other curry powder I used didn't have the same strong flavor as McCormicks. When I added all the sugar, my family considered it a little too sweet. Try adding a tablespoon at a time and tasting it to be sure you didn't add too much. Don't get sweetened coconut milk. Or buy very slightly sweetened coconut milk. If it is sweetened, add no sugar or less. Once I accidently bought sweetened coconut milk and added a lot of sugar...I had to add lots of milk to dilute the flavor which made the curry all watery.

Awesome recipe! I like to shred the chicken as a personal preference. I use Penzys sweet curry powder, and substitute honey for the sugar which gives it the something extra people might be looking for in this recipe.

Good recipe, very light and hearty at the same time!
I made it as indicated in the recipe and it didnt need anything else.
Only thing I may try next time is spicing the chicken more directly.

I'm giving this a 4 only because I had to make many provisions in it, but the result I believe is a 5.  I took many suggestions from viewers.  First I had whole stewed tomatoes in my pantry, so I put it in my processor on pulse so it came out slightly chunky, but mostly like sauce (I think this helped the result to be creamy in the end).  I added cayenne (since I didn't have crushed red pepper), paprika, curry paste (green because that's what I had), white pepper, tumeric, cardamon and ginger (I had the refridgerated squeeze kind).  I added diced cooked/skinned regular potatoes and added about 2+ tbs of heavy cream at the very end.  I used 3 tbs curry (instead of 2) and 2-3 tbs sugar (instead of 3).  I kept it covered for about 30 minutes and didn't have a problem with it not being creamy.  I served it over steamed basmati rice.  I didn't get the review from my husband yet, but not sure if they'll be any left by the time he gets home.  If I were giving it to my daughter, I'd skip the cayenne pepper, but I'm not sure if she's ready for Indian flavors yet anyway.

This turned out well. We used 1 lb. of chicken and added 1/2 bag frozen peas, 1 can bamboo shoots, 1 sweet potato (cubed), 1 red bell pepper and 1 can of pineapple. Ended up using about 4x the curry b/c we only had grocery store brand on hand. Will probably seek out some better curry in the next few weeks and will try again to see what differences there are. Was well received all around and made for great leftovers. Served with Basmati rice.

This was very good - could be a little more flavorful, so I'll add a bit more curry next time.  I did cut back on the sugar, just to 2T instead of 3T - I like a sweeter curry, so this was perfect.  It was a little soupy, but I noticed what was left in the pan had thickened upon standing.  We had it with naan tonight - will have leftovers with jasmine rice or over potatoes.  Yummy.

Good Stuff. I modified the recipe big time, by cutting the amount of chicken down and adding zucchini, squash, button mushrooms and carrots. I sautéed the carotts in the beginning where it calls for the chicken, and added the rest of the veggies in with the canned tomatoes.
If I make it again, I will probably throw in a chopped sweet potato. 
It tasted very similar to a dish i order at my favorite local thai restaurant, they include sweet potato and it is fabulous!
Serve over jasmine rice, of couse!

Honestly, if I knew cooking with curry was this easy, i would have eaten it a lot more throughout the years!! I did do a couple of changes... i've doubled the coconut milk and the tomato paste, as I wanted more of a 'coconut' flavor.  I also wanted extra sauce, as I added some potatoes, green peppers, onions and extra black pepper to the mix.  Fabulous over rice!

This was my first curry anything and it turned out fabulous! I experienced the common worries of making this recipe for the first time: the amount of curry seemed like a lot (it wasn't), there was a lot of liquid/sauce after I combined the milk and tomato sauce (simmering will reduce it), and I needed a bit more oil after cooking the curry for the sliced onion. I did drain the tomatoes a little and I used a can I already had of stewed tomatoes which had peppers and onions, etc., in it - I just picked out the tomatoes and added some of its juice to the curry sauce. My mother (whom is very scared of trying something new) said the sauce tasted great, but was a little on the sweet side (she doesn't usually eat sweet dishes or anything sweet for that matter). So, if there is someone in the family who does not eat sweets - you might want to cut back on some of the sugar and taste test before covering it to simmer. Oh, and the smell of curry will still linger in your house the next day!

Enjoyed this curry a lot! Next time I'll skip the can of tomato sauce, it made the dish too tomato-y for us. Great taste and it made a lot! The only problem is that I cannot get the smell out of my house, no matter how many tricks I try!

This was amazing!  Of all coconut curries I've made (Martin Yan, etc.) this is absolutely the best and it's so simple.  I use lite coconut milk and added some vegetables at the end.  One cooked, cubed Yukon potato (sweet potato would be great) and some frozen peas made this a complete meal.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. It needed salt, and I added 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash, and some fresh cilantro, and served it on brown rice for a complete meal. A keeper!

this was excellent!! everyone in the family loved it. I doubled the curry like many suggested, used about half the tomato sauce, added hot pepper flakes, and served it over jasmine rice. Also, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added the curry to the oil to create a past before I added the onions and garlic. Will definitely make this again!! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was very tasty!  I only used about 1 lb. of chicken, and it was plenty.  I also cut the sugar in half.  It wasn't really coconutty - but it was still very good!  Mine wasn't spicy at all - I'll probably add something next time to make it spicy.

I don't have much experience with true curry dishes so I don't have much to base off of previous dishes I have made.  Still, my husband enjoyed the flavor and we will make this again.  This makes a lot of food and a lot of sauce.  I wish the sauce was a bit thicker, but I can work that out.  This was also a dish that we just kept eating and eating...bowlfuls and bowlfuls were consumed.  My 3 year old son liked this a lot too.  So it can appeal to a lot of ages.

This was very good- I drained the tomatos, used a whole large white onion, & 2T brown sugar. I added about 2-3 T. peanut butter at the end, & topped with cashews. Great on rice cooked in chicken broth!!

This recipe turned out very well.  I used lite coconut milk instead of regular to save some calories, and my husband said that he wished that the dish had more of a coconut taste, so next time I will use regular coconut milk and just go to the gym that day.  :)
I served with rice and steamed vegetables and it was a great meal!

My family LOVES this recipe. The kids can't get enough of it!! They are 6 & 11. My Dh can't digest onions to well so I make a paste out of the onion and garlic than add it to the curry. I also use the same things to start my rice. I use chicken broth with the rice and it comes out wonderful and full of flavor!! Sometimes I even trow in almonds, sunflower seeds, or regular peanuts. Just for the added crunch.

One of my favorites.... To extend the recipe I add either shell pasta or Basmati rice. Also, you can use 1 lb. of chicken and 2-3 cups of your favorite veggies (carrots, broccoli, etc.). Or, for a vegetarian version, omit the chicken all-together and add more veggies or tofu. The curry mix I use for this is 1 tsp. ground corriander, 1 tsp. ground cardamom, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, and 2 tsp. groud cumin. Yum!

People have commented on it being too sweet and I wonder if some people used Coconut Cream instead of Coconut Milk.  The cream is very sweet.  Another culprit might be the type of curry used.  I used spicy curry, not sweet curry and my dish came out perfectly flavored.  Like previous suggestions I drained my stewed tomatoes and let the dish simmer a while uncovered to help thicken the sauce up.  I like having plenty of sauce to serve over rice.  My husband and son could not get enough.  I plan to make it again next week.

This was so good!  I took other reviewers' advice and added extra curry powder, black pepper and garlic cloves, plus I added some cayenne pepper and about a half teaspoon each of cumin and ground ginger.  I also chopped up a red pepper and threw that in whith the onions and garlic.  Next time I will use reduced fat coconut milk since I found the regular kind to be VERY rich, and I will also eliminate the sugar.

Really really good.  I was expecting it to by spicier, but that's okay!  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and didn't bother with the sugar.  I also cut back on the tomato sauce and you could taste more of the coconut.  Will keep this recipe and make again!

This is a simple yet delicious base for coconut curry which can be endlessly varied.  I tweaked this recipe slightly by adding 1/4 tsp. cumin, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp. Chinese Five Spices (McCormick brand) along with the coconut milk.  Next time I might use 1/2 tsp. of each.  I did not have tomato sauce, so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, drained.  I had some tofu on hand, so I cubed it and threw that in, but I would prefer adding potatoes and/or mini eggplant to soak in all that wonderful sauce, which was quite plentiful.  I absolutely recommend adding additional vegetables to this dish, and it is something that is even better as leftovers, giving all the flavors time to meld.  I served this with a cool cucumber-mint raita and it was marvelous on a hot summer night!

Delicious! One thing I changed was using only a half can of tomato sauce and a half can of coconut milk. I also added fresh grated ginger and some cayenne pepper for extra spice.

I left out the can of tomato sauce and it still made more than enough sauce to serve over rice. It was easy to make and so flavorful.  This will be a new regular at our house.

With a little tweeking this was an all round family hit!! Prewarned by other reviewers about soupyness(?) I drained excess liquid from a can of diced tomatoes and being from Australia I didn't know what was meant by tomato sauce. We call Ketchup tomato sauce, so a used half a can of tomato puree.I also only added A small ammount of suger. Keeping an eye on the ammount of liquid I decided when it looked "juicy" enough. I then simmered for only 20 mins. For perfect presentation I sprinkled chopped fresh corriander ( I think you call it cilentro in the USA) and flaked almonds on the top just prior to serving with Basmati rice. My Husband looked at it and said "WOW, am I a lucky Man!!!" the kids asked for seconds and hubby asked for thirds!! A great success!

I love curry.. and I have never been able to make a dish that tasted like the "real thing".. This was it! I used red curry and it worked great. Someone had mentioned that it was soupy.. A lot of thin sauce, but I pulled the chiken out and reduced the sauce for a few minutes so the chicken wouldn't overcook. I added red bell peppers and used a can of diced tomatoes with chiles (that was the only one I had)which gave it a bit more of a kick. I still added a little bit of red pepper flakes, served it over jazmine rice and it was a hit! Thank you!

Not bad.  I did as others suggested and left out the can of tomatoe sauce and in its place I used a tiny can of tomatoe paste.  Made the sauce a nice consistency.  I did add red pepper flakes and some sea salt and hungarian paprika for a bit more of a kick.  Maybe I'm not head over heals for a strong curry taste and this def had that. But I did love the tomato with the coconut milk.  I will make again and maybe cut back a tad on the curry.  I must say I did eat through a half a loaf of bread dipping it in the extra sauce so it intrigued me in some good way.

I'm eating the leftovers from last night as I type this, and yep, it's as good now as it was last night.  My boyfriend and I are big fans of curry, and I'm always trying different curry dishes.  This one is very delicious and authentic for being such an easy recipie.  The ingredients were everything I already had on hand.

I used 4 chicken breasts.  I only added 2 tbsp of sugar, but next time I will add the full amount.  I also added a potato, and it was yummy, soaked up all the sauce.  I also put more pepper and curry becauase I like it very spicy.  I have to say though, that it takes longer than the 30-40 minutes to cook if you want the sauce to thicken up.  After the 40 minutes, it was still soupy so I just turned up the heat and kept stirring it to reduce the sauce.  Another 10 minutes on high heat reduced it to the perfect consistancy, and the proportion of sauce to chicken and potato was perfect.  My boyfriend said that this was the best curry dish I've made yet.

I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of chili flakes to give it some more bite.  

This recipes is quite similar to the African Curry recipe also listed here.  

Make sure not to add three tablespoons of sugar like the recipe says to: way too sweet!

This was a pretty good recipe. i've made it twice the first following the original recipe and the second time omitting the tomato sauce and draining the diced tomatoes, i increased the curry powder and added some cayene pepper to give it a little more heat. it was great that night but even better the next day. this will be a regular at my dinner table.

If you like curry, you have to try this! I made this for dinner last night- loved it and my husband can't stop talking about it! I made just a few changes: skipped the tomato sauce, added just a bit more curry powder, added potatoes and carrots. I will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend is Indian and has tasted many cur1ries but he says this is the best he's had! I did spice up the recipe, however, by adding cilantro and ground red pepper to taste. Let it simmer for longer than the recipe calls for otherwise it is too soupy.

I thought this was pretty good.  It is very soupy.  I believe next time I will omit the 8 oz. tomato sauce.  I added 2 large diced potatoes, several sliced carrots and a handful of peas to give it a little more color. I also used diced tomatoes itstead of stewed. I also will say that I stuck with the 3 Tbsp. of sugar and thought it was just right.

The only thing I really didn't like about this recipe is it was too runny for me. So, the second time I made it I drained the stewed tomatoes, and used half of the tomato sauce. I also mixed about 1/2 tsp. cornstarch/some of the juices in the pot in a cup (to break up the cornstarch)and then tossed it back in during the last 10 minutes of cooking. I liked the color with the tomato sauce added in, otherwise I would've just taken the sauce out completely. It was great this time! If you like some kick to your curry, though, you're going to definitely need to add some spice (I added in a little cumin and cayenne pepper, because I like mild curry).

This dish was really good.  I added a little red pepper and the potatoes and carrots like others had suggested.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because it wasn't as coconutty as we like.  I will definately make this again but maybe add some coconut flakes or extract to give a more coconut flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe and it was also very easy!!

I always order curry with coconut milk at Thai restaurants. This is the first time I've ever made my own and it turned out fantastic.  I added diced potatoes and frozen peas. You could use firm tofu instead of chicken for vegetarians.

This was absolutely delicious!   I did nothing different than the recipe except that I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Served with broccoli, rice, and naan.  I will be making this again!

This recipe was fantastic. I did what one reviewer suggested about cooking curry by itself in oil before adding garlic and onion to it. I used full-fat coconut milk. It took about 50 minutes for the final product to thicken on the stovetop. Served with Jasmine rice. I added frozen peas and raisins to it but those were my only changes. Will make it for sure!

Wow! The whole family loved this. It makes a tasty sauce, so I recommend having rice or quinoa along with the chicken. I also made roasted vegetables that were great alongside the recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe! Here are my embellishments I have found work spectacularly!  I halve the tomato sauce. I use fire roasted diced tomatoes. I saute about a teaspoon or more each of fresh minced ginger and garlic in peanut oil. I use yellow curry paste NOT powder. I add the curry paste to the sauteed ginger and garlic and throw in the onions to make a slurry. I simmer and add oil as I go along as it will dry out if you don't. Saute until the onions are translucent. After you add everything else chop up some fresh Thai basil and add some to the dish while it thickens and save some for garnishing to serve. I serve over rice and occasionally add fresh pineapple! OH YEAH! ( You do NOT have to use sweetened coconut milk , the recipe calls for sugar)
(After making this recipe many times over the last couple of years I have mixed yellow AND red curry paste and shallots WITH the onion.  AMAZING!)

This is one of the best recipes I have made in awhile. We did add sautéed mushrooms and a half of an orange pepper. I served it over jasmine rice. I think it's a perfect summer time recipe. My family absolutely loved it. We just made it last week and we are already making it again! Great recipe!

As written, I think this is personally too sweet.  I would just recommend that you start with 1/2 the sugar, and go up from there.  It's easier to add than subtract.  By using less sugar, this recipe is easily 4.5 stars for me.  What brought it to 5 stars was to add some ginger with the garlic, a tsp of fish sauce, a can of chickpeas, and a big handful of chopped spinach at the end, just until wilted.  Serve with raisins and peanuts on top. These ideas are just my preference and not reflected in my star review.

This was delicious! I followed the advice of Cook Staphanie, and cooked the onions and spices for longer, then added the fresh tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a big hit with my family. Even my kids loved it, and they don't always like curry.

Excellent! So easy and a very flavorful dish!   Made exactly as stated but I did substitute red curry paste for the powder and added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to add a little heat to the sweetness!  I did simmer uncovered for about an hour which thickens it.

Easy and perfect for a workday dinner!  I followed the recipe as written and agree with many reviews that cooking longer and without the lid produces a much thicker sauce.  Perfect served over basmati rice!  Will definitely make this again!

Fab-u-lous! Easy, wonderful. Read reviews and broke up tomatoes, simmered uncovered about an hour, stirring every so often. Served with sushi rice. Loved, loved, loved it!

You definitely have to add in your own seasoning and a dash or two... Or three of extra salt on the chicken. I used mostly organic ingrdients. Not sure if that made a big difference in the flavor. But it started off very bland. I doubled the amount of coconut milk, unsweetened, taste of thai was great. It gave the sauce a creamy texture and wonderful, tropical smell. I cubed a few golden potatoes and put those in when I added the tomatoes. Make sure the liquid mixture covers everything, otherwise it wont fully cook the potatos. This was a GREAT introduction to curry for a family that isnt to familiar. And super easy to make  your own by adding in your fave veggies. I would follow the advice of others and let it simmer with the top off for at least an hour, that does make the sauce alot thicker. A very comforting dish, and im thinking it might work better and add more flavor if cooked in the crock pot for a few hours.

Roma, Thank you for submitting this recipe.  My family loves it!  I have made some slight changes by adding more vegetables like carrots and potatoes, halving the amount chicken, substituting ginger for garlic and adding a table spoon of smoked paprika.  And sometimes using precooked chicken from Costco to cut the cook time in half.  Thank you again!!

I haven't cooked many curried dishes but this was simple and very good. It was a little spicy for my wife though. I need a primer on different curry pastes with regard to heat and taste so I can experiment with other dishes.

We always come back to this yummy curry! Add veggies (zucchini and yellow bell pepper are good options), simmer with the lid off, and add salt.

The recipe is really great, as with all recipes, i improvised a bit and added some veggies such as potatoes and red and green bell peppers,  in my country chicken curry here is not served with tomatoes so i didn't know that tomatoes would improve the recipe so much. And the best part of the recipe is that even though i just used about 1/2 kg of chicken, there's still so much! The leftovers were frozen so that i can eat curry for the whole week. That could save you a bit of money as well.

Did it as directed except used garlic powder instead of garlic. After cooking it for two hours in low heat, the taste was a strong coconut sweet and a strong tomato sweet, which was ok.  I used this for a meal prep. I warmed some of it today and it tasted delicious! The sweet of the coconut and tomato somehow blended together so it wasn’t overwhelming. All I can think is to maybe let the curry rest before eating it. I’d use this recipe again.

This was so easy and delicious.  My wife commented numerous times how good it was.  Next time I may add more Cayenne pepper to kick it up even more.

Good base recipe. I skipped the tomato sauce, used petite diced tomatoes, cut the sugar in half. After tasting I thought it needed more spice so I added a teaspoon of cayenne and a big squeeze of lime. Served with baked white rice. Family loved it and I will certainly make it again.

I followed "Cook Stephanie's" advice and cooked the curry powder first about 5 minutes. (I substituted coconut oil in place of veg oil and doubled the amount of curry powder b/c I wanted  strong curry flavor and I made 3lbs of chicken). I added onions. When they were almost translucent I added garlic. While this simmering I strained diced tomatoes set aside juice. I added  tomatoes as well as 2 cups of red, yellow,  orange bell peppers. Added the chicken and followed the directions. Instead of adding a whole can of tomato sauce I added just the cup  juice reserved from the can of diced tomatoes. I added 2 small sweet potatoes and simmered uncovered 50 mins. It turned out delicious. My husband, 13yo, 5yo,  2yo. Loved it! This will be a new go to favorite for a tasty, inexpensive meal for  my family.

I live in Pakistan and I don't know what curry powder is. We do have one curry powder but i don't like its flavour because its very spicy. So i skipped that. I made it only in salt and black pepper. It turned out really well and according to my taste buds. I added 2 medium onions, 2 medium tomatoes, half kg chicken, half cup tomato sauce and 1 can of coconut milk. It turned out all fine. Everybody loved it. If you don't like your curry to be sweet then you can skip sugar as well. Without sugar it will do better with roti.
This was the first time i ever tried coconut milk in something as we do not commonly use it in our everyday cooking. So, I really liked it and I will try more recipes with coconut milk now.

This is fast and amazing- I make it all the time! I used Jamaican curry powder, and I like to add peas & cauliflower for a veggie component. You can use coconut oil & milk or cream if you don't have coconut milk. We are Indian food fanatics and very picky... this is a winner.

A simple serving tip is to use a measuring cup to mold the rice, surround with the curry. Garnish the rice with parsley or chives, and the curry with shredded coconut. Pretty and pleasing to match the flavor of this great tasting and easy recipe!

Basic recipe is great as written. EXCEPT, I recommend using only ONE tablespoon of sugar (and preferably light brown sugar, if you happen to have it). I also suggest cooking the curry in ghee (clarified butter), a staple of Indian cooking instead of oil.

Wonderful recipe! I sautéed the onions, garlic and spices together, browned the chicken then cooked the whole thing in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours. I used 4 whole chicken thighs. I cut the sugar down to 1 teaspoon, it was plenty. When the chicken was done, I removed the bones and skin and put back into the crock pot. I added a little red pepper flakes for a little kick. This one is a keeper! Thank You!

So very good! I did what the previous reviewer suggested, I toast the curry powder in olive oil. I use a generous amount of oil. But watch it so it doesn't burn. No sugar is needed. I make my own tomato sauce from our garden tomatoes. I suspect that makes it even better!

This recipe just didn't cut it for my family. The compliment of flavours in this sauce just didn't do anything for us.  It was too hot and the flavour just wasn't there for us. I wouldn't make this again following the recipe exactly.

I'm obsessed! I did listen to one of the other critics and used paste instead. Green and red curry paste. It's amazing and I can eat the whole batch alone. I used Thai kitchen green and red curry paste. And when I was done I threw the batch into the slow cooker and it made the chicken so tender since everyone is so picky in my family about their chicken I thought what better way to please my picky family. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for all the element a your taste buds scream for.  You really don't feel the heat of the curry until after you are reaching for your Second spoon. Amazing. Thank you.

This is AMAZING. I never have cooked Indian food before, and let me tell you this is so easy! The only modifications I made were: I used a full onion (because I love onions), unsweetened coconut milk, and I simmered for one hour.  It turned out absolutely perfect. I am recommending to anyone I know who loves Indian food! I have enough (I am only one person!) for my week! I served with basmati rice.

Delicious recipe! The coconut milk truly brings out a unique flavor. I found that my batch needed some more curry powder, but I realize this is simply preference. I also added some zucchini, which was great. Be PATIENT in letting the dish simmer...it WILL thicken in time. Would make again and would recommend!

Although, the recipe tasted like tomato sauce with curry, it was good. I prefer anything "Curry" to really taste like "Curry". But, I enjoyed cooking something different.

Absolutely delicious!! I just made this for the first time tonight, and I will definitely be making this recipe often!! My boyfriend, who eats tons of chicken, said "this is the best chicken dish he's ever had", & has now said several times now how good it was & thanked me multiple times for making such a delicious dinner.  Thank goodness I doubled the recipe, because I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

LOVE this recipe. Make it often. I agree with Cook Stephanie about cooking the "broth" before adding the chicken. I always cook the curry powder or paste, depends on what I have but high quality is very important, with the oil and I also add oil as I go, even before I add the onion and garlic if I need to. I cook the paste with the oil for at least 5 minutes then add the onion, (1/2 onion roughly chopped), and garlic, (I use 4 cloves), and cook for another 10 minutes or so...adding oil if necessary. I use chicken thighs instead of breast, the flavor is better and there is more fat in the meat. I add chicken and cook over medium heat until the chicken is just done. I also agree with Cook Stephanie that fresh tomato is better but organic diced canned works too. I add the tomatoes, coconut milk, sugar and let it cook. I usually add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and let it simmer to the right consistency, then correct the seasoning. Sometimes I chop a bell pepper and throw it in the sauce for the last 20 minutes. Great with any rice and veggie combination. This is a go to recipe in our house!

This recipe depends greatly on the curry you use. I get my curry from Maine... the company name is Gryffon Ridge. I like their Ivory Coast curry blend. The Jamaica or Sri Lankan are good blends as well, Sri Lankan being the mildest. I have a friend who makes this and does not heat the curry and oil... not a good flavor. This step activiates the curry, so to speak; just don't breathe in the fumes!!!!!!!

Anyway, I follow the directions to the letter except that I simmer it for about 1.5 hours. I really like this dish. The flavor (if you use a good curry) is excellent. I serve this with Basmati Rice, as the flavors marry very well.

This is a keeper!

Made this tonight, and it's fantabulous.   Yes, I made a few changes as I didn't have any canned tomatoes or tomato sauce so I chopped up 6 fresh tomatoes.   Also added a little extra salt, some dried crushed red pepper flakes, and for color I added about 1/4 package of frozen 3-pepper and onion blend.   Will definitely make this again and again and again.

Great flavor! Sauce was rather thin, but I let it boil instead of simmer. Next time I'll turn the heat down on the burner!

The good news is that it tastes good.  However, the finished product just simply tastes like salted and peppered chicken drowning in thin tomato soup with the occasional piece of tomato.  

Recipe is way too thin, sauce is not creamy enough.  The sauce steals away the curry taste, yet provides no sweetness or coconut flavor of its own.  

It wasn't worth the prep, but it was good enough to eat.  Also, it's probably perfect for someone who just wants a slight hint of Indian flavoring.  

Surprised there's no rice mentioned, nor is there naan bread.

I was very sceptical about this recipe when I first read the ingredients (i.e. mixing curry and tomato) but my family absolutely loved it.  I did reduce the tomato sauce slightly as I did not want have an overpowering tomato flavour.

As is, this has WAY too much tomato. I will try it again with NO tomato sauce, more onion, more spices, include turmeric and ginger, and (again) follow Cook Stephanie's method for making a "broth" first.

This is one of my most favorite things to make after finding it on allrecipes!  I do end up simmering it for the last 20 minutes or so (at least - probably even longer) with the lid off so it thickens up a bit.  Other than that I just follow the directions.  Love bringing the leftovers to work with me the next day!  Quite possibly my favorite recipe I've come across on here.

Bland, sweet and soupy.  It was stew-like, not a curry.  Could have benefited from seasonings besides just curry powder,  salt and pepper on the chicken.  Paprika and cayenne pepper might help along with some salt in the dish. Really sureprised by all the 5 star reviews.

This recipe was great!! I followed the other suggestion for cooking the curry powder in the oil for a few minutes, then the onions until translucent then simmer for about an hour or so.  I also added about 2 or 2 tbsp of cayenne for some spice. Will make again and again!

This is an excellent curry for anyone new to making curry. Probably the MOST important thing to keep in mind when making a curry is that the quality of the curry powder (or paste) will mean the difference between a great dish and a poor dish. There are a lot of mediocre (at best) powders out there, and they will result in a mediocre dish. I can just about guarantee that the reviewers claiming this was "bland" used a mediocre (or old) powder. The second thing that I need to say is in response to the comment advising people to use sweetened coconut milk. With all due respect, this is not a good suggestion. I'm a seasoned (pun intended) curry maker, and I've never seen any recipe that called for sweetened coconut milk. Of course, the "correct" thing to do is what works best for your palate, but it's certainly not traditional to use sweetened coconut milk.

This is awesome and so easy. I doubled the recipe and omitted the tomato sauce and used instead one can of tomato paste and TWO 28 ounce cans of diced tomatoes. Instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil and heated the curry powder for about 5 minutes before adding the onion and garlic and continuing to heat through for about 10 minutes. I found I needed to add more oil before adding the chicken. Added the tomatoes, paste and coconut milk and was instantly delish.  Because we like spice I added a couple of Tbsps of Rooster Brand garlic chilli sauce and about a tsp of garam masala. Absolutely fantastic. As far as it being mild as written, it is. For those who like a stronger curry;  as with most curry dishes I try, I added 1 1/2 times the curry in the beginning.  Will simmer like a stew for a couple of hours and probably add some veggies later. Already tastes and smells amazing! Thank you!

Simple and very tasty.  The only changes I made was I added fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes (all I had) and  at the end I added some shredded coconut because I love coconut.  The sauce thickened up for me and the tomatoes disappeared.  I did not find it tasting like canned soup at all, perhaps this comes to the quality of the ingredients and not the recipe.

Leave out some of the diced tomato and tomato sauce... it over powers it.

New comfort food staple.  Even my 2 yo devours it.  For a no fuss veggie, I mixed in hot prepared chopped spinach. Very satisfying.

Easy to make and very delicious. I did find 2tablespoon of curry powder to be a bit overpowering so I will just reduce the curry powder next time around. Safe to say, my first attempt at making coconut curry was a SUCCESS!!

Excellent! I withhold the tomato sauce but add a couple extra Tb of sugar. I love curry, so I use 2-3 Tb...Cook the curry with the oil for 5 or 6 minutes on low heat, so as not to burn and then cook the onion for 5-10 min. Double the amount of coconut milk and stewed tomatoes (drain tomatoes well) so there's extra sauce for the rice and this is a great mouth watering comfort meal!  -guywholovestocook

OMG thanks so much for this recipe. So good!!! The only two things I changed was instead of regular sugar I used brown sugar and I didn't have chicken breast but had turkey tenderloins and it is just as good.

Really enjoyed this and it was so easy. Cooked onion longer to get it soft then added garlic so the garlic wouldn't burn. I used coconut oil instead of veg oil. Very tasty. Last time I made it I made it a little spicier by adding a Fresno chili pepper. Mild heat but not over powering. And I used an extra garlic clove. Definately an exciting and flavorful thing to do with boneless,skinless chicken breasts. Thanks Roma, this was right up my alley.

This recipe is excellent. Please note that you need to use canned coconut milk and not carton coconut milk that is intended to be drank. If you use carton coconut milk, the dish will turn out bland and tasteless. I served it over jasmine rice.

Thanks for the inspiration! I did make some changes: I used olive oil, sauteed a chopped onion, red and green peppers. Then added 2 TBSP of mild curry paste and a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. I let that carmalize a bit then added lite coconut milk, the garlic, a scant bit of Domino light sugar and the chicken which had been marinated in plain greek yogurt with garam marsala. Simmered it for 2 hours and served over brown rice. It was fantastic and will def make again!

Delicious! We have made this quite often over the last few years. Tonight I rediscovered my pressure cooker. I prepared exactly per the recipe and added about a half cup of rice... Pressure cooked for about six minutes and it was fantastic! Just as good as when I simmer for an hour. Try it!

This recipe was great.  By no means does it taste like what my mom cooks at home. She's from the Caribbean and it tastes completely different. That being said, this tastes fantastic. The only problem I had was it was a little too sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar in half.

Followed recipe exactly but toasted the curry before adding anything else. Sauteed onion few mins then added garlic so it didn't burn. Simmered for an hour. Chicken was tender and sauce is tasty! Served over brown rice and steamed carrots.  Excited to make this again!  Yummers!

We have been looking for a curry this good since visiting and dining out a little bit in the NYC area. We have tried other curry sauces, but none of them have tasted anywhere near this good. I do add one caveat. We did just switch curry powders (a store brand to mccormick), so this is assuming that wasn't the dominant factor.

Believe the hype. This was phenomenal and I can't wait to make it again! It is a bit of work (we get our chicken from a farm so dicing up the chicken thighs takes a bit). 
I used red curry paste and cooked it in coconut oil for a few mins, then added the onion & garlic, then the chicken. It smelled so good, I wanted to eat it all then!
I added some cashews and meant to top it with a little shredded coconut but forgot. Would definitely add the cashews again. Also, my husband noted that this would be delicious with pineapple chunks, and I agree. I will give that a try next time! (Which probably won't be too long from now!)
Also, it did take a good hour+ of simmering (a double recipe). At about 45-50 mins it still looked quite thin and I was a bit disappointed - if you get to that spot, just WAIT! It thickened up SO beautifully into this silky, luxurious sauce. Wait it out, it's worth it.

My 2.5yo is usually a good eater but has been quite picky the past few months... but with this dish he kept exclaiming "I LOVE rice! I LOVE rice!", so that's high praise indeed. He cleared his plate.

I will make this again simply for it's ease and convenience.  This did not taste like a typical, say, Thai cuisine at all. I think that you should either lay off the tomato sauce or perhaps add more coconut milk to tame the acidity. I will try to add more milk next time to see if it goes better. My husband and oldest child like it enough for seconds but it wasn't amazing!

This recipe is sensational!  I followed the directions with the exception being I used cooked chicken that was cubed and was pleasantly rewarded with a dish that tantalizes the eyes, nose, and palate! I served this over saffron rice and topped it with slivers of Serrano chilies and Jicama (texture thing).

This was delicious! I followed the recipe (almost) exactly, just a few minor tweaks.  I added just a little pinch of cumin to give it an extra kick.  I had exactly 2 Tablespoons of yellow curry powder, so i used that.. I wish I had a little bit more to add - or something stronger, I felt it needed something more (but thats my personal taste), I also threw in some frozen broccoli & served it over brown rice.  I did let it simmer for about an hour and a half, and it thickened up - just not enough for me - so i added 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch into 2 Tablespoons of water and mixed that into the curry.

I've only made curry a few times before and this was easy and delicious. The only change I've made ( by accident) is to use chipotle roasted tomatoes instead of plain canned ones. My husband strongly approved of the gentle kick!

I made this tonight and OH MY! My son is eating his seconds as I type this. It was soooo good! I did read some of the reviews and made a few minor changes. I sauteed the curry powder (I used yellow--and added some turmeric as well) in the oil for about five minutes, then added the garlic and onion (Which I diced up using my Ninja chopper). I used veg oil but I had coconut oil in the cabinet and think I will use that next time. I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts (hubby and son prefer them over the white meat) and added those to the mix. Simmered as was stated for 7-10 minutes then added light Coconut milk (I'll use regular next time I think), a splash of low-sodium chicken broth that I had in the fridge, and Redpack petite diced tomatoes (drained the juice). I didn't have tomato sauce and saw that some reviewers left it out anyway (I am not a big tomato lover), so I omitted that. As it was simmering, I added a sprinkle of cumin, some more turmeric and some more curry powder because when I tasted it, it was too tomatoey. I only added four tsps of sugar also. I did add a TBSP of cornstarch in the last ten mins just because I wanted it to thicken up a bit faster. Served it over Basmati rice and a side of garlic Naan bread and it was DELICIOUS!!! The chicken thighs were great to use because they literally melted in your mouth. I wanted to go back for seconds but my stomach was full from eating the firsts! :D Will definitely make this again!

Amazing! The first time I made it as written but accidentally used Italian style diced tomatoes instead of plain and it was so good! I later tried it with plain and it wasn't nearly as flavorful so I always use Italian. I love this recipe so much I made a vegetarian version I could eat while nursing a baby with chicken allergies. Instead of chicken I put in a russet potato, 2 carrots, 2 apples, 2 celery sticks, and 1/4 cup golden raisins (don't let the raisins frighten you, they are great in there). It's so yummy it's gotten rave reviews from everyone I've made it for. I also cook the curry paste in oil for longer, 5 minutes or so, then add the onions to saute for 10 minutes before adding more ingredients. It makes a big difference.

This was a great basic curry!  I made some slight alterations.  I used beef instead of chicken and added red bell pepper.  In addition I seasoned the beef with cumin and black pepper instead of salt and black pepper.  Overall it was delicious and cooked down nicely.

I HIGHLY recommend you also add 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut to the mix when it simmers for the 30-40 mins! It made this recipe ten times better! My husband and I devoured it and are fighting for the leftovers! :)

The recipe was ok. There was too much tomatoes how ever and the sauce was too thin. Advice to people who are going to cook this: Cut out the tomato sauce and add more spices.

I followed the recipe as written and I loved the recipe, but I think the sauce was sweet and did not have a strong curry flavor.That said, the recipe was very good. Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1 tablespoon, increase curry powder to 4 tablespoons and add heat by way of red chili flakes or diced jalapeño.

I have never made ck yellow curry from scratch. I've  always had Indonesian yellow curry  sauce in a  package and  added  it to  the  ingredients with  coconut  milk. I'm  so  thankful  to  find  this  recipe  yesterday. My inlaw and  husband  enjoyed  it  so  much  and  my  picky  toddler  daughters  ate  without  any  complaints. :)  However, I added carrots (cut diagonally) &  cubed potatoes,  hence used  less cauliflower. Did not  use  tomatoes. Used  regular  coconut  milk (so I  didn't  have  to  put in  Brown  sugar  like  other  reviewers  recommended). Used  more  curry  powder  than  recommended  and  used "better  than buillon"  because I  didn't  have  chicken  stock.   Used  hawaiian  salt  and  white  grounded  pepper in the end and it  was  absolutely delicious!! Mahalo!!

I made this for dinner tonight and we both loved it.  I followed the suggestion of "cooking" the curry powder with the onion, etc. for several minutes. Instead of chicken breasts, I used 2 pounds of chicken legs. I did not take the meat off the bone, just cooked them in the sauce (after first partially cooking/browning them). Worked perfectly and is less expensive. I used a mild curry powder and I think I may try either a paste next time or at least a medium curry powder.  My DH says he doesn't think that's necessary; he thought it was absolutely delicious as is. I agree about delicious.... but still will probably try a medium curry powder. :) In addition to the onion (I used a whole one) and garlic (I used 3 large cloves), I added a green pepper and also, following others' suggestions, 3 medium potatoes cubed.  I did not have tomato sauce so added about another half a can of chopped tomatoes.  I also put sliced fresh mushrooms in.  (The extras were things that needed to be used -- I think it lends itself to that, within reason of course.)  I let it simmer, cover off, for about 40 minutes.  It was plenty thick, possibly because of the added potatoes. This is not difficult to make and looks as good as it tastes.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Wow--great recipe! We are watching our sodium intake, so I used no-salt stewed tomatoes and no-salt tomato sauce. I also used light coconut milk to make the recipe healthier. I gave the stewed tomatoes a spin in the food processor before adding, and cooked the ingredients uncovered for about 45 minutes. The sauce was nice and thick, and the whole dish was positively scrumptious.  I served it with brown rice and steamed veggies. Will be making this again soon!

Just cooked this and ***WOW*** so good. I only modded the recipe by adding "condimento" instead of just garlic. Condimento is a blend of garlic, onions, cilantro, recao, and some caribbean sweet peppers. Also, I used thigh/leg portions divided. I also left out the tomato sauce. I browned the skin then nestled the pieces skin side up on the onions and curry. I gave a medium dice to a potato and chunked that in.

I think about "authentic=or-not", I do. I don't know and don't care this recipe is just wonderful!!

Very good. Made it with a Garam Masala curry powder mix and it tasted wonderful. Also - instead of sugar added some Apricot Jam and threw some mushrooms in.

WOWZERS!! I loved this recipe. It was perfect. All you have to do is follow this recipe to the letter and you will have a beautiful meal, or you can tweak it a little and still be good, I just added a 1/2 teas. more salt,pepper, and garlic mixture to my chicken just because I want to make sure I can taste the chicken in the sauce, and 1/2 Tbs. more or cumin powder also on the chicken before throwing it in the skillet. I'm a beginner cook and experimenting right now, thank you God for an loving husband and dog that will eat anything:.) Just kidding, but yeah I'm experimenting right now and this has to be one of my favorites! Everyone one in my family of 6 loved this meal and I took some leftovers, yes there will be a little
Bit of leftovers, another reason you get 5 STARS ma'am, and my co worker loved it. So thanks for the recipe. I loved it loved it loved it!!Directions clear and in layman terms; all ingredients present, timing on point! Who is excited? ME!!

This was my first time making curry so I chose this simple recipe. My family loved it, though my son remarked "Wow, candy curry." He thought it was a bit too sweet. I did too. So next time I will leave out the sugar as the coconut milk I used was sweetened already.  To me that was enough.  The recipe was very very mild. If you like it spicy you might want to zing it up a bit more. I'm not a zingy person but I did add a bit of cayenne pepper and ginger.  And because I have to watch my weight, instead of putting in two pounds of chicken, I used one pound and added some chopped cauliflower and broccoli to the mix. Good stuff.

This recipe is amazing!  This was my first attempt at cooking something curry-ish!  The first time I try a recipe I always follow it to a T and then play with it the next time if I want to change things up a bit!   Second time I made this I added a little more curry powder and garlic.  I also now add a potato or two cubed up and also some red peppers and peas....whatever veggies I feel like throwing in!  I find when I add the potato cubes that it thickens up the sauce a bit so I will just eat it as a one bowl meal without having to have rice or anything else with it!  I should also add that this is wonderfully good re-heated as well.  I live on my own so when I make this I have enough that I can enjoy a few meals out of it and then also put some in the freezer for the next time I am craving it!

Thanks for the great recipe!  It is now in my usual rotation of meals!  :)

This recipe was amazing! I took Cook Stephanie's advice about the 'broth' and I am so glad I did. It was my first time making curry, so I was little nervous and skeptical that it would even compare with curry I have had in restaurants. This was a pleasant surprise. I used unsweetened coconut milk, but found the sugar to make the dish too sweet, so I added about another tsp of curry powder, and we used whole chicken thighs. Stunned both myself and the hubby. Definitely keeping this one!

This is an AWESOME basic recipe. I tweaked it a bit by doubling the recipe, eliminating the sugar, adding chili peppers for heat, and I used a whole cut-up fryer (bone-in) since that's what the indian restaurants near me do for extra flavor. You can't overcook this, since you want the chicken falling off the bone and for the bones to give it more broth. I served it over a mix of carrots and cauliflower to make it Paleo friendly and I never once missed the rice.

There were no leftovers.

I really enjoyed this dish!  It is easy to make and tastes really good!  My wife who is not a curry fan really liked it!  It is a great starter recipe which is exactly what I was looking for.  It did make a really runny sauce but most dishes I’ve had at Indian restaurants had a similar consistency.

Great base recipe for curry. I've never done curry, and my wife and I loved this. Decided to use brown sugar, added raisins, and some Louisiana hot sauce. This will be a staple for us.

This is fabulous!  Don't know if I can say I made it exactly as the recipe was submitted or not.  Used chicken thighs because I had them and threw in four or five sliced mushrooms because they needed to be used.  Other than that no changes whatsoever.  Absolutely loved the end result.  Thank you for our new "best" curry recipe!

this is a staple meal in our home now. I have made it several times and every time it turns out delicious. simple and easy to make. I only make one change, I omit the sugar and add honey as the sweetener for added health benefits. I have used this sauce over fish as well as veggies, not just chicken. Thank you to roma for submitting a winner!

The flavor definately seemed to have more depth on the second day. Too mild for me, but good starter curry recipe for someone who's never had curry before. Extremely easy to make. I sauteed the curry powder (will do curry paste next time) for a couple min, then added onion for a few more min, then garlic for a couple more, then added cut up, drained canned whole tomatoes and sauteed a couple more-THEN added chicken. After browning chicken I dumped it all in the crock pot on low for a few hours. Tossed some peanuts in there, served over jasmine rice and topped with some green onions and a little more peanuts. Oh, I added sliced zucchini to the crockpot and that was really good! Would definately make again but maybe double the curry and add some cubed potatoes. Kids didn't want to try but I'll get them another time lol =)

YUM! My not-so-adventurous mother and 10 year old sister even liked it :) Everyone asks for the recipe.

*Modifications*
Added: cayenne, paprika, cumin, extra salt
Omitted: tomato sauce (I did use all of the liquid from the stewed tomatoes and that was quite enough IMO)
Reduced: Sugar down to 1.5 tbsp

Followed the recipe to a t, but found it not at all coconutty, and very tomato-ey. If I made this again, I would substitue more coconut milk for the tomato sauce to give it more of a coconut flavour. Good though :-)

Wow. Absolutely delicious! As others suggested, I mixed the oil and curry for 5 minutes, then added in and mixed the onions for about 10 minutes.  Once the chicken was done I added in freshly sliced tomatoes and some yellow squash and just one tablespoon of sugar.  And I ended up using some garden vegetable pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Everything was so good, and the smell was so aromatic and soothing, it was a wonderful dining experience. There's a ton of sauce, and while we didn't have any Naan, I served it with rice and some bread.  Will make this so many more times!! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!  Probably one of my AllRecipe favourites!

the flavor is really great, but I wanted to make this more of a one-pot dish so I added frozen peas and cauliflower. Much better! Then I also added a cubed, cooked baked potato. If I had sweet potato I would have put that in too and I will next time. I will also add cashews and red bell pepper. It just seems to need more stuff to make it 5 star good.

I was looking for a traditional yellow chicken curry recipe, but after reviewing many different ones online, some seemed to lack flavor, which I was avoiding.  I thought I’d give this one a try.  I have to say the house smelled amazing and my husband even commented on how good the aroma was.  I felt 3 tablespoons of sugar was a little too much.  I added a diced potato in with the chicken.  In addition, I added another tablespoon of curry powder and about one teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  The dish was very good, however it’s still lacking something.  Next time I may chop up an entire small onion, perhaps that will give more flavor.  

This was good and I would definitely make again.

This passed the test for SURE.  Thank you!  I made a few mods just based on what I had on hand.  I added raw sugar rather than granulated, curry oil rather than vegetable, spiced tomatoes, zucchini, and cilantro to top.  I simmered for a couple of hours.  Topped with fresh coconut and orange slices, a bit of cottage cheese and spinach.  Risotto and a couple of grape tomatoes and it hit the nail on the head!  As always, your posts and reviews are great:)

Loved this! I made it for dinner tonight, because I had some canned chicken that I wanted to use in something, and I had coconut milk. Voila, curried coconut chicken! I used 2 cans of Kirkland chicken chunks, decreased the salt, and left out the onion and garlic for health reasons. I decreased the sugar to about 2 tablespoons, because I think the coconut milk is plenty sweet. I added 1 red bell pepper, cut into squares, and also a handful of raw cashews. I simmered for over an hour. I LOVE the extra sauce that soaks into the rice. Jasmine rice was delicious with this curry- I'll definitely be making this again! Extra bonus: It's gluten and dairy free!

This was good. I did add a bit of sour cream to it at the end to give the sauce creaminess (it felt watery, even after a long simmer) and I added golden raisins and cauliflower. I would have liked a more complex flavor, but it was a good basic dish.

Love it. I use coconut cream and cook it with the lid off to allow some of the liquid to cook down and it thickens as it cools. I was very happy that the first time I ever tried to make a curry I chose this recipe and it was everything I wanted it to be. Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe for the first time today and I am sure that it is not the last time when I am using it! I have to write that since I enjoy spicier dishes, I added Cayenne Pepper. Goes very, very well with this!

I think adding the sugar was a mistake for me.  Taste it first before adding, then gauge how much to add (if any).  I used a rotisserie chicken so I didn't have to wait so long for things to cook. And I added a can of peas at the end just because I love peas in curry.

I didn't think I even like curry, but I wanted to try something different.  I loved this dish so much that after we ate every bite of chicken for dinner, I went to the freezer to get another pound of chicken to use up the extra sauce!  I only used 1 pound the first time and I used fresh tomatoes because I had them.  So here I am at 9pm and cooking a 2nd dinner so I can eat the leftovers tomorrow.  Yum!!!

Excellent, this dish was wonderful that my whole family enjoyed. Loved how you could taste the spicy and sweetness of the curry!! I added a 1/2 can of pineapple juice and thinly sliced pineapple to the recipe, as well as some coconut flakes. Delicious!

This is good, but I wish it were a bit more savory.
Made this again using Rotel mild tomato sauce, 4oz sour cream and 2 tbsp of sugar and it came out perfect for me and my family. It had a bit of spiciness, sweetness, and was more savory.

This is my first try at Curry. It came out really good. I cooked it with and without the cover long enough and high enough in order for it to make a thick type of gravy and I added a veggie buillon cube in the end for more seasoning. Really good. I served it over Jasmine rice and added steamed broccoli around the dish before serving.  Thanks Roma!

This was my first attempt at anything curry, used mild powder and also just added some penzey's tandoori seasoning which is a nice combo of spices including ginger. The only problem was I needed to cook at medium for about 1 hour to get sauce to a good consistency. Kept tomatoes, tomato sauce, lite coconut milk, sugar the same. Tasted good with jasmine rice and cauliflower. Will def. make again.

This is really good. I did tweak the recipe a bit because it wasn't spicy enough. I added Cayenne Pepper, Garam Masala and Ground Cloves. I also added Cubed Potatoes and decreased the Sugar to 2 tbs. Next time, I'll decrease the sugar to 1 tbs as I thought it was too sweet. I will also add in some frozen peas. I also used a can of light coconut milk. When it comes to curry sauces, this one is definitely the closest when it comes to the consistency that I prefer and it was one of the easiest Indian recipes that I've made. Definitely a keep and must try!

This was good, but not amazing.  I made it as directed (using lite coconut milk), but had to add more curry powder, cumin, and ground ginger to perk up the flavor.  It still seemed like it was missing something, but I couldn't identify it.  I will definitely make it again and play around more with the spices.

This is a great dish, we enjoyed it very much. I made some small changes, I use a whole chicken cleavered into chunks, the whole chicken has a much better flavor than plain breasts. Also,  adding carrots, potatoes adds another flavor dimension and a tsp of Garam Masala spice is a must!
 Served it over rice.

Very tasty dish. I took away the 5th star because of the sugar. I did not add any and did not miss it at all. Other than that, I stuck closely to the recipe and it delicious!

I'm not sure how thick this was supposed to get, but I let it simmer for longer than suggested and it was still soupy. Very good though! The sauce ended up tasting like a rich tomato rather than coconut-y, which I didn't really expect. I would make this again and add some veggie of some sort...not sure what, but would also go really well with rice.

This was very good!  My husband really, really loved it.  It will definitely take more than the prescribed amount of cooking time, so plan accordingly.  I did make a double batch of the "sauce," and probably cooked it down for 2 hours.  I used slightly less sugar than called for in the recipe.  All in all, this was an easy recipe, despite the cooking time.  I did set off our fire alarms when I was cooking the curry in the oil!

This was my first attempt to make Indian Curry! I was pretty excited after reading the reviews & am going to add one. You all were RIGHT! Its so yummy. My fiancee was not thrilled with the "smell" of it when he came home from work so was not too eager to eat! However, once he started he couldn't stop! Some of you might wanna hang me for this but I added some grated fresh ginger (cuz I LOVE it) and it was REALLY GOOD! I also added a bunch of vegies about halfway through. Thinly sliced carrots, pea pods, cauliflower, green onion (on TOP of the regular onion added earlier), and sliced mini-portobello shrooms. It was amaazzzing! In fact, I'm gonna eat leftovers right now. Served it over jasmine rice & mixed in honey roasted cashews & peanuts - wouldn't do it without them - so good! I live in the most rural town in America (sarcasm but close to true) so couldn't find a GOOD curry - I can't imagine how amazing it will taste when I do as it was already the bomb! I'm saying 5 stars with good curry paste 4 stars with bad. Thats how good it is!

This was great, my BF raved for days! Easy to make with simple ingredients. My only adjustment was a little more cayenne & crushed red pepper for a little more heat. Served with Naan bread & chutney.

This recipes was outstanding! Served it to my family and company and they loved it! I followed it exactly but added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little kick. Also had to cook it a little longer with the cover off half way through to thicken it up! Definitely a "10" recipe!!!!!! Thanks Roma!!!!!

9/13/16 still making this recipe and still love it!!!! Amazing! Even bought my red curry powder in St. John, USVI. Love the video!!!!

I followed the recipe to a point as I did not have tomatoe sauce. I was low on powdered curry and added a heaping teaspoon of red curry paste and I added corn starch to thicken it. I hate to rate a recipe that I know I altered from the original but this was fantastic! Thankyou Roma for submitting this!

This was lovely.  You definitely need to simmer it a long time to get a concentrated flavor.  I added large chunks of butternut squash, which really added another layer of depth.

When I first found this recipe, I was a little uncertain about combining tomato and coconut -- it just sounded weird to me. But I went ahead and made it, and I'm glad I did because it was one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted! I once had a similar curried chicken at the Tusker House restaurant in Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom that rocked my world, but this recipe was even better.
I did make a few changes to the recipe, though. First, I didn't have onion on hand, so I just left that out and I don't think the flavor suffered because of it -- I might not even bother adding it the next time I make this!
For seasoning the raw chicken pieces, I used freshly ground pepper and sea salt -- I used *at least* the amount suggested, plus a few more cranks of the salt/pepper mill.
My skillet wasn't deep enough for the chicken and the tomato/coconut mixture, so while the chicken pieces were cooking in the curry/oil/garlic, I combined the rest of the ingredients in a large pot. Once the chicken was thoroughly cooked, I added it to the pot.
I found that, after 40 minutes of simmering, the mixture was still runny, so I added about 3/4 cup shredded, sweetened coconut flakes and cooked it uncovered until it started to thicken.
When it was just about ready to serve, I used my potato masher to shred the chicken in the pot (the Tusker House curried chicken was shredded, and I just prefer shredded over chunks).
I served it over pearl cous cous, and my guests and I loved it!

very good recipe, I served it over rice with steamed brocolli and it had a wonderful, full flavor.  I gave it four stars because it has a little bit of a ketchup aftertaste but I will definately make this again.

This recipe was an excellent starting point for a curry, though it did need a little help spice-wise. I tasted the sauce about 15 minutes in to the cooking time, and noticed that it tasted very sweet and bland. To amend this, I added about 1 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce, a good helping of black pepper and kosher salt, and about 1 tablespoon of fresh grated ginger. After the additions the sauce was fantastic. Even my husband liked it, who has been scared of curry in the past.

This recipe is amazing!  After reading some reviews, the only thing I really changed was I added an additional tablespoon of curry powder and a little more oil.  I served over rice and my wife raved about it.  This will definitely be a staple recipe in my home!

Easy and great for a winter supper.  I use 3 tablespoons curry powder and a few red pepper flakes.  It does not get as thick as I like so I usually thicken it with a bit of corn starch at the very end of cooking.  It is a family favorite and an easy and unusual entree for Supper Club.

Easy recipe to follow. Impossible to mess up! Cooked curry in oil a little longer as someone else reviewed. I served with fresh Naan Bread and it was a hit!

Very easy and good although just a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me. I'll definitely make this again but with less sugar and spicier curry.

This was absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 a large shallot instead of an onion (didn't have one) and I used a little more oil in the beginning cause the curry oil became too thick. All in all it was soooo good and it made enough leftovers for 5 days! Win! :) Also, the only thing I had to do different was mix a little cornstarch and water and add that to the sauce to thicken it a little.  I can't wait to make this again.

Made this today, it's a very good recipe.  Used madras curry powder, 4 cloves garlic instead of 2 crushed in a garlic crusher. Used a whole medium sized onion and 1.5 tblsp of Splenda instead of the sugar.  Added dash of cinnamon, chile powder and cumin which seemed to have added a bit of complexity to the flavor, will try increasing by a bit more next time.  Cooked the curry in oil for 4 minutes, added garlic and onions and cooked it another 2 min, then the chicken for another 8 min.  Simmered on low for about 40 min. and served over brown rice...delicious, like out of a restaurant and pretty easy to prepare.

This was a pretty good dish, but it made too much sauce, I thought. I made it pretty much as written, though the can of coconut milk I bought (13.5 oz.) was slightly smaller than the recipe called for. The recipe made a good amount, and lasted me for 4 dinners, served over cooked white rice. It was quite tasty, but if I made this again, I'd cut down on the liquid.

Reviewing as recipe is written - It was watery and needed to cook longer as the chicken was still tough.    After an hour, I took matters into my own hands and added cornstarch to thicken juices and it was ok.  This tastes just like Chicken Tikka Masala to us.  I served it with the Thai cucumber salad on this site and saffron rice.  It was a good meal.

I was confused when shopping for curry...there are LOTS of different kinds/flavors of curry!  I ended up with Masaman Curry paste.  After a short search online, paste/powder can be substituted equally without changing the amount.  Everything was fine until I put the tomatoes, tomato sauce, and entire can of coconut milk into the pan.  It looked like a pinkish mess.  But, I knew it needed to simmer for quite some time (at least an hour based on previous reviews) so my hopes were still relatively high.  After 40 minutes of simmering, the coconut and tomato  flavors were still overwhelming.  So, I added about 3 more TBSP of the curry paste, and now it tastes like curry, and its actually pretty yummy!  And LOOKS like coconut curry, I can actually taste the curry, and its no longer a pinkish mess.

Pleased with the results, especially as it is a easy recipe. Used red pepper flakes for a little extra kick, as well as fresh tomatoes.  Added a little extra curry and followed previous comment regarding cooking curry in oil a little longer than directions state.  Also cooked over medium without cover after 20 minutes, since it would take a lot longer otherwise.  Left on for 30-35 min more and thickened nicely.  Good recipe, will probably repeat.

Perfect as is.  I've made this many times and have come up with a slightly modified version I make.  I add 1 WHOLE onion sliced, and two cloves of MINCED garlic.  Also, I double the oil and curry, and use this wonderful hot curry I got from Williams Sonoma.  Serve atop Coconut Jasmine Rice and you have a winner!!!  This is my GO TO curry for the past 3 years and everyone loves it.  Simple and good!

This curry is delicious and so simple! I made it vegetarian by substituting tufu for the chicken. I also added some potatoes, cashews and red pepper flakes and skipped the sugar. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes and I had no problem with the sauce thickening up in under 40 minutes. 
No doubt I will be making this again!

I made this exactly as written, and we loved it. The only thing I would do differently next time (and I'm definitely making this again, soon) would be to add more onions and tomatoes. This recipe is simply amazing. Thank you Roma!

I must say that I have never cooked with curry, so I was a little nervous how this recipe would turn out. It was amazing! I followed the recipe as is and it turned out perfect. My husband and I both liked it a lot!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok. I think it really depends on the type of curry you get maybe? I used a curry paste from the supermarket in Mild. I found this recipe to tomatoey for my taste, and not enough coconut....also a little bit of spice would have livened it up some!

This was the first time I cooked with curry powder.  I was nervous making this dish however after the dish was complete and we tried it, I added it to one of the best dishes I've made.  I love this dish.  The only thing I might reduce was the sugar.

Simply Amazing. I cooked it a little bit longer at low heat to make sure the chicken soaked up all the flavor. My husband loved it. Enjoy!

I made this exactly as written and served it with basmati rice. It was excellent, and the leftovers the next day were even better. (I mixed the leftover rice into the leftover chicken and let it soak up all the sauce overnight in the fridge.) Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Fantastic recipe! Made several changes. Used firm tofu instead of chicken. Added 1/2 red bell pepper, 3 shitake mushrooms, few small chunks of pineapple in addition to the onions. Used a larger qty of vegetable oil, added the onions, red bell peppers, then 2 1/4 tbsp curry powder. Then added tofu, sauteed a little, then  mushrooms and pineapple. Then coconut milk, tomatoes and simmered. Towards the end added a spoonful of crunchy peanut butter and tons of basil for flavor. Used 2 tbsp only.

Delicious! I used regular diced tomatoes rather than stewed and added a bit of red pepper. Perfect level of heat for me this way but perhaps too much for others.

Heaven on a plate!!  This is now on my list of all-time-favorite recipes.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes or tomato sauce, so I used 2 large fresh tomatoes, and served it with with fluffy white rice.  I may add some toasted coconut flakes next time.

This was very tasty and very easy to throw together.  I could not bring myself to add 3 tablespoons of suger; I added not quite 1 tablespoon and still found it a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will leave the sugar out. I will make this again.

This did not turn out as I had hoped.  I used powdered curry and used maybe 4 Tbs instead of just 2 and still it wasn't the flavor I expected.  I added a little too much oil so I did have to spoon off puddles (yuck) later but I'm sure that was my fault and not the recipe.  Truly, so much potential but I'm not sure what to add to make it taste like I wanted.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  I have always wanted to attempt making curry, so this recipe was a great one to start with.  The only change I made was to add 2 Tbsp. red curry paste instead of the curry powder.  I also decided to add about 3 red potatoes, cubed and some frozen sweet corn.  Altogether it was very good and the family enjoyed it!  I have 3 children who have a sensitive tongue to spice, so if you have children and would like to introduce them to Indian good... I would definitely recommend this dish!

I thought this was a very yummy dish...but my family of 6 was split 50/50.  My boys don't care for rice or chicken much, so they weren't crazy about it....my girls love chicken and thought this dish was yummy, although a bit spicy for them.  I thought it was all around delicious, I loved the spiciness and I did add a couple green peppers.  Worth a try if you are a fan of Thai food!

I think this was too sweet for my taste. If you like sweet tomato sauce then you should be ok with it. Next time I will add less tomato paste and only one spoon of sugar. Also the quality of the curry is very important, make sure you use some good curry, some are not as strong as others.

REALLY GOOD RECIPE, my 4 year old thought it was too spicy so nect time I might use less curry, the sauce was thin so next tiem I'll add some cornstarch to to coconut milk to thicken it up a bit. I added carrots and potatos delish, now I won't miss World Curry, only to make some Nann bread to go with it :)

This was okay. Too sweet for my taste, I would cut the sugar AND the coconut milk in half. I also had to add about 2 tsp of chili powder to give it some kick, it was really bland when I tried it initially. It was a nice change of pace, but not quite right for me.

This is one of our new weekday favorites, also makes great lunch leftovers.  prep way in advance so you can leave this on the stove for a good while to let it thicken up. we also added red pepper flskes and will probaby add a veggie next time

I was apprehensive about this recipe. I love Indian food but had never had coconut in curry before, but this recipe was delicious. I found the flavors good, but a bit bland for my taste so I made a few modifications: 2 tsp salt,  2 tsp of cumin (whole), 1/2 tbs more of curry powder and dash of chili powder (I like my food spicy). I think the extra salt and cumin really make this dish go from pretty good to delicious. My friends enjoyed the dish as well. This is a keeper!

This recipe was very easy to make. I followed the directions to a T. I thought that the flavor was okay, my family didn't care much for it. I think it was missing some flavor. Maybe with a little tweaking it would be a better dish.

I always wanted to make a curry dish at home and I wanted to experiment with Silk Coconut milk and this was the perfect recipe. I browned the chicken pieces and then I used a slow cooker in high settings for 3 hours. I didn't have stewed tomatoes nor tomato sauce. I used tomato paste instead. Slowly simmered sauce was delicious with white basmati rice. Thanks for the recipe.

The original recipe is great but for more flavor and to really make this recipe amazing I added a cup of chicken broth, cilantro, ginger, green onion and one more tablespoon of curry. Also I omited the tomato sauce and sugar (coconut milk was sweet enough)

Tasted amazing! :)

This was great!  I didn't have coconut milk - just cream of coconut leftover from pina coladas.  I used 3 Tbs. of cream of coconut mixed into a hot cup of milk to substitute.  I didn't have the tomato sauce so I used a 6 oz. tomato paste and I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced.  I simmered uncovered for about 25 minutes and served over white rice.  Delicious!

Cooked 1 1/3 lbs. cubed chicken and onions together on skilled, then added the garlic and later the curry.  2 lbs. of chicken would have been too much.  Used 2 pinches of salt to taste.  Also did half the amount of sugar and it was still sweet.  Lastly, the dish needed a little bit of basil.  Only gave it three stars because it needed some "help" to make it better.

This is really quite good. These ingredients weren't strange and I could pick them up at the local grocery store. I've had leftovers for lunch for the past 2 days and it is even better than the night I made it. Good served alone, with rice, or even spaghetti squash.

This was delicious, the only changes I made was adding 1 tbps better than boullion chicken broth, squirting in some ketchup (b/c I had no tomato sauce), lowering sugar to 2 tsp, adding bamboo shoots and sliced napa cabbage for more texture... Oh and  :)  poured in some whipping cream and 1/4 cup plain yogurt.      so quite a bit of substitution, but the finished product was great and quick to whip up.

I made this last night for my wife and son. She said yummy, that is a keeper. Son really enjoyed also. A very easy to make dish. Delicious even for the basic American pallette, a great starter dish for those just starting to explore curry.

Great Recipe... I added potatoes and carrots. If you want your chicken juicy take it out from the pan after you cook it with oil for 7 mins just put it back in the pan 15 mins before you finish reducing the sauce.

I would say it was a people pleaser! It was easy to prep, easy to cook and wow did it taste wonderful. I don't think you can mess up this recipe. I did add a bit of corn starch to make a thicker sauce and I found some pepper flakes from a pizza place and added that to the recipe. Other than that, the day after meal for lunch was great as well as the dinner. I think if you simmer it longer it will make it more flavorful. Other than that the recipe is pretty much perfect. Thanks Roma. Great recipe and I really had a craving for curry!!!

This was really good! I will add a little more curry and drain the tomatoes the next time I make it.

First off, I have made this recipe EXACTLY as the directions state and it turns out awesome!  I know sometimes I get overwhelmed by everyones suggestions but I wanted everyone to know that this is amazing as is. Personally, after I got comfortable with this, Ive now started adding extra tomatoes and extra curry and allowing it to simmer for hours but thats simply my preference.  This is great leftover too! It has become the favorite meal in our household.  Its very adaptable, Ive made it with extra chicken and with less chicken, doesnt matter, always delicious!

The family loved this dish.  I made very slight changes to it... added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and used one whole onion.  For my husband and me, I put 1/2 of the dish into a separate pot right before starting the simmering and added 2 sliced celery sticks and 1/2 thinly sliced serrano chilli pepper.  It was very tasty over steamed rice... YUMMMY

Great recipe.  As another reviewer said, you can't screw it up.  I made several mistakes and it still came out really good.  Next time I will be more careful and I'll bet it will be even better.

I tried this recipe as I had a can of cocunut milk that I had been meaning to use. It was so flavourful and tasted better reheated the next day. The only thing I changed is that I added some chili paste for a bit more of a kick and some vegetables to the dish as well. I found that I needed to thicken up the sauce with a bit of cornstarch but that may be because the tomato juice I used was not very thick. I can't wait to make it again, maybe with shrimp instead of chicken next time.

this recipe was simple and delicious, and i don't normally like simple. I did use fresh tomatoes rather then caned...makes a big difference, I also added crushed red pepper for a spicy kick and unsalted cashews makes it a perfect 10.

This is my favorite recipe!! I've made it several times, and each time everyone raves!! The only things I change are the vegetable oil to extra virgin olive oil, and then I sprinkle some shredded coconut on top when serving. It goes fabulously with brown rice!

Love it, this was my first attempt at curry and it came out delish...followed some of the review suggestions of cooking the curry, then onions and followed this recipe exactly, did cook on low simmer for a little longer than suggested to let sauce thicken. Very good and very easy, will make again

I made a few changes, I didnt add the can of tomato sauce since I already had diced tomatoes and added some of the jarred curry paste with a little bit of water. To top it off, it sounds crazy, but white seedles grapes are amazing with this, just try it you wont want to make it again without them!

Fantastic recipe!!!!  It was creamy and delicious.  I did have to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce but next time I will try simmering without the lid and hope that will do the trick.  I made it exactly as directed otherwise.

Our family loves this recipe, from the adults, to the teen to the tweens to the toddler.  Not spicy and has a nice sweet taste, we have served over yellow rice and have served it over white rice also.  Make lots of extra because you'll want more than one bowl!

Made recipe as listed, except used green curry paste instead of curry powder.  Chicken was very tender and overall dish was delicious.  My husband (who generally does not like coconut anything) and my 2-year old both loved it.

I made this as a curry sauce (no chicken) the day before the dinner party. Found no need to simmer for a longer time (as others have suggested) when the juices from chicken were not present.  Doubled the sauce recipe, not doubling the sugar and adding one chopped jalapeño pepper.  About an hour before dinner, I slowly reheated the sauce, along with cubes of cooked turkey breast (2 lb.).  I added peas during the final few minutes of cooking, and chopped cilantro at the end.  Served with basmati rice pilaf, raita, and a salad with orange vinaigrette.  Excellent.

SO good!  I made a couple of small changes, just to reflect our personal tastes.  I increased the curry poweder to 3 T. and added 1 t. of garam masala.  I also used quite a bit more salt than the recipe called for, to balance the sweetness of the tomatoes and coconut milk.  As another commenter suggested, I simmered the dish uncovered, and it thickened up beautifully.  My husband had three servings before I made him stop so there would be something left for my lunch tomorrow!  Thank you, Roma, for an easy and delicious recipe!

Very simple, and taste great...I believe flavor all depends on the curry powder you use...So make sure to get fresh high quality curry powder, or make your own.

Okay -- best fresh.  The taste the next day was pretty flat.  Either way, I'd like to sweeten it up a bit (and that was with a whole pumpkin in there).  Maybe some pineapple?

absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I usually use a mix, but they stopped selling the good ones. This was fabulous, easy, and we scarfed it all up! Will DEFINITELY make this again. Oh yes, next time I'll add more spice. It needed it. I guess I'm used to a more pronounced curry flavor. It was quite mild.

I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept the seasonings the same because I wanted a substancial sauce to go with it. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. At the very end I felt it needed a bit more curry so I added 1 teaspoon. When cooking the onions and garlic I added a tiny bit of water because the skillet was very dry and I was afraid of burning the curry/onions and/or garlic. I served this delicious chicken with white rice, cumin seed papadums and chopped cilantro on top. My husband loved it. He took it to work the next day for lunch and said it was even better.

AMAZING recipe!  I had some Trader Joe's Biryani Curried Rice in the freezer I wanted to use up, and I chose this recipe to go with it.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used about a half cup of spaghetti sauce, and I added an extra dash of curry powder during simmering for a little flavor boost.  SOOOO good, especially with the Biryani rice!

Followed recipe to a tee.  Very very good! A little bit sweet and a  slight kick to it at the same time.  We just loved it.  Served over hot rice, this makes a great meal!

I love this ! it reminds me of a Nigerian dish that my dad used to make that called for peanut butter.   My roomie can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of the only things we could both agree on making.... i always top with fresh friut and cashews.

The most amazing dish I've had in a while. I used chicken thighs and cut the curry powder down to 1.5 tablespoons, because I'm a bit of a wuss when it comes to heat.

Absolutely yummy! The only thing I added is some ginger and some Chayote (its looks like a large green pear, but wrinkly), and it reminds me of home.

I've made this dish now 3 or 4 times, and it is always delicious.  I grew up on curry without coconut milk; but the addition of coconut milk makes this a truly outstanding dish.  Thanks Roma for a wonderful recipe.

I love curry and had always been reluctant to try to make one of my own because of the intimidation factor, but I had all the ingredients for this recipe and decided to try it.  I'm so glad I did!!! This recipe was easy and was EXACTLY the flavor I was looking for.  I will definitely be making this again when I want chicken curry.  Awesome.  Thank you for posting.

If I could I would give this one 4 and 1/2 stars, the missing half would be for the tomatoes.  I did not care to have chunks of tomato in it, I think it would be must better to just leave them out.  Coconut and tomatoes just don't work for me, but that's just my personal opinion.  Otherwise it was great, I will definitely try it again!

This was a delicious, easy recipe, and definitely fulfilled my curry craving.  I made the recipes exactly as suggested and it turned out great.  The only change I would possibly make would be to add a bit more curry powder, but it was definitely delicious as is.

After trying a couple of other coconut curry recipes, this is the one I will keep! Delicious! Here are the minor changes I made:  I used a whole onion, cut into chunks. I added a about 5 extra dashes of salt. I simmered UNCOVERED for an hour, then added potato and carrots chunks and simmered another 45 minutes. Leaving it uncovered helped the sauce thicken nicely. I would suggest this method if you have the time, rather than thickening the sauce with cornstarch. Letting the liquid evaporate off seemed to concentrate the flavors much more, giving it more depth. Truly yummy!

Really delicious!  Used brown sugar in place of white and light coconut milk.  Simmered uncovered for about 45 minutes so it thickened up nicely.  Lots of requests for the recipe!

YUM.  Made this for a potluck today and it was the hit of the party.  I needed to make a bit more so I made it for 8 servings.  I noticed that the cans were all doubled in the recipe even though I didn't double the servings which would have been way too much liquid so be careful of that if you are making more than 6 servings.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing and it was great.  I did leave it simmering for more than an hour with the lid off in order for the sauce to get thick enough.

This was really good and easy!  I used curry paste instead of powder, which I think adds a richer flavor.  This is great for a week night meal, and can certainly be doctored up with more veggies.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  This is the first curry recipe I tried and it was a big hit.  I added in one diced sweet potato, which worked well.  I also had to add roughly 1/2 tsp corn starch with 1 Tbs. water after 45 minutes of simmering and that thickened it up perfectly.  I also added some cayenne pepper and additional curry powder to my plate to spice it up more, although the level of spice was perfect for my wife.  For those trying to avoid carbs, this is fantastic over "cauliflower rice."   I will definitely be making this dish a staple in our house.

I made this recipe as written. I prefer it to be sweeter and made with less tomatoes. I would drain the fat from the pan before adding the coconut milk and tomatoes.

Very good.  I changed it per others reviews.  I paritally drained the stewed tomatos and cut them up a little bit, used only half of the tomato sauce and only 2 TSP suger.  Also made used cornstarch and cold water to thicken it up at the end,

Mmmmmm! I was impressed with this recipe. I was a little worried at first because I've never made a dish like this before. The only thing I didn't like about it was the curry. It made my wooden spoon yellow and stained my counter tops. I had to soak sections of my counter tops to remove the stain. Lucky for me, it came off. WHEW! I'll still make this recipe again though. Its not a recipe I would use all of the time but definitely when I'm in the mood for something different.

I followed the advice about cooking the curry great tip! This was my first time making a full blown curry dish and wow! It turned out amazing. I pureed my can of tomatoes and added red bell pepper too. I didn't have tomatoes sauce so I decided add extra pureed tomatoes and reduce.

I have made this dish several times. It always turns out good. Finally, yesterday I decided to break a few rules: I drained the tomatoes this time and added 1 tbsp. of crushed unsalted peanuts, 1 thinly sliced carrot, a half of a red pepper, sliced, and about 1/2 cup of choped basil leaves. the more important change is that I used duck breast. I sliced a duck breast seasoned with salt, pepper and cury powder, fried it and added to the coconut milk sauce when it was done. A lot more flavor without much extra work.

A favorite!  I make this one in our regular rotation.  Here's my edits: I omit the tomato sauce and use a 30 oz can of diced tomatoes (with liquid).  I add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes when I add the tomatoes, for a light kick.  I double the garlic, halve the sugar, and let it simmer uncovered to reduce.  Throw a little rice in the rice cooker and you're done!  So good, lots of rich flavor.  Love this recipe!  Thanks, ROMA!!!

YES, THIS IS RESTAURANT QUALITY and so easy!  I prepped chicken last night and 9 yr. old grandson did about everything else.  I browned curry PASTE in oil as suggested by Cook Stephanie.  Used diced tomatoes, cut sugar in half (my preference).  After sauce simmered uncovered for about 20 minutes, I used the suggestion from another reviewer and premixed 1 T. cornstarch with 2 T. water and added to sauce to thicken   Dinner was ready in 40 minutes.  YUM is right!  The perfect flavor.  I'm checking out Roma's other recipes!!

WOW! I made this EXACTLY as written. We loved it!  There was a lot (~2 cups) of sauce left, which I froze.  A week later, I pulled the sauce out to thaw while I was at work.  When I got home, I added 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken (also thawed from the freezer) and added 1 cup of frozen peas.  I just heated it through.  (Hate to admit this, but I made quick-cooking rice and bought the naan.)   Dinner was on the table in less than 15 minutes!--and, again, to rave reviews.

I like this recipe but I did tweak it a bit.  I added freeze dried chili pepper that was pulverized in a coffee grinder for some kick.  I also removed a little of the sauce to a bowl, added a tsp of corn starch and mixed it. Then I added it back to the pan.  Served over steamed broccoli and rice.

This was excellent! We loved it! I followed the recipe exactly. The only drawback is is that my house smelled like curry for 3 days! I have to figure out how to make this meal outside!

Absolutely Delicious! This was our first time cooking with curry. We all loved it and will be making this dish often. Followed the recipe, only simmering without cover and it and it thickened up right at 30 minutes. Thanks to everyone on the RE that gave me excellent advice/info on curry and thanks to the submitter of this recipe! 7/6/10 - Update: This is the second time making this within the last month. It is that good! DH and kids really like it and 1 1/2 year old granddaughter gobbles it up! One of our favorites!

I followed the recipe to the 'T' but still found it too runny after all the cooking time (even uncovered).  Decided to thicken with cornstarch.  The flavour, however, was phenomenal.  It may not be as spicy or bland as some of you like but that's for each of you to adjust to personal taste.  I highly recommend this and I agree that I prefer this over a meal at a restaurant.  Served this with roasted red pepper.  Delicious and very good to serve for dinner guests!

This is wonderful...made last night and everyone loved it even the boys who turned there noses up as I was making it. So simple to make! Did not change recipe at all except mine simmered longer than the 40 min by the time everyone got home it had simmered about 2 hours or more with the lid only partially on pot the chicken was so tender and so much flavor the sauce was just the right consistency. I served this with Basmati rice and fresh garlic Naan bread I picked up at our local Indian restaurant. this is a keeper !!!! My best friend just happened to stop by as I was serving and he is originally from Jamaica and said this was very good and similar to something his grandmother used to make needless to say he was impressed and took the recipe from me

Easy and fantastic. Followed another reviewers advice to cook the oil + curry spices together for about 5 mins before adding the onions and garlic. Also would recommend simmering without the lid for a better consistency. (I did it with the lid on for half and off for half and it was a little liquidy for my preferences.)

I'm giving this a good review, because my mistake shouldn't be the recipe's fault.  I added chick peas, and I think it made the dish better.  Next time I make this, I will use a good quality and AUTHENTIC curry.  The aroma in the house was incredible!  But there was no flavor :(

This was my first time making something like this and it turned out great.  I don't like really spicy food and this had just the perfect amount of spice for my taste. I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I simmered it covered for about 20 minutes and then uncovered for another 35 to 40 minutes so it thickened up.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious served with rice and a cucumber salad.  A little spicy, but, i didn't use any sugar, so that may be why.  i didn't have stewed diced tomatoes, so i just used a can of chopped tomatoes, and it worked great.  i also followed another recommendation and cooked the curry in the oil for 5 min and then sauteed the garlic and onion until glassy.  was fantastic!  easy to "watch" as well for those busy evenings.

i've made this twice so far and i love it.  you can add whatever veggies you like and it only gets better.  i added potatoes and they come out very soft  and tasty.  also i added 1 extra tbsp of curry and 3/4 tbsp of cayenne pepper powder to put a little heat in it.  i'm gonna put more in next time cause i like my indian dishes very hot.  thanks for a great recipe roma.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  My house still smells like it 24 hours later!  I followed the recipe except I added some thinly sliced red pepper strips at the same time as the onion, increased the curry powder to 4 Tbsp and I also used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, and drained the tomatoes to keep the sauce thicker.  It took about 1 1/2 hours of simmering to get it to the right thickness though, unless you like a runny sauce, but I don't.  I served it with Jasmine Rice and Naan Bread and got rave reviews from all our dinner guests and my hubby.  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful! My husband doesn't like coconut, so he was leary about trying. However the coconut milk adds to the taste without being over powering.

This is so delicious and easy. I sometimes add some frozen peas at the end of the cooking time and serve with a sprinkling of fresh coconut. I usually cook only for myself so halve the ingredients. Since I have a half can of each of the liquid ingredients left, I freeze them together in a container to use the next time I make the dish. It is so good heated up the next day along with rice when I get home from work.

This was very easy to make and it tasted good, but too tomatoey for me, and a bit too sweet for my taste.  I should have known by the two cans of tomato in the recipe, but for some reason it didn't compute- was like tomato soup with chicken - I added cilantro and green thai curry paste to tone the tomatoes down, also had to thicken with cornstarch beaten into cold water and add to boiling stew.  But chicken was tasty, tender, could barely taste the curry for the tomatoes-  good for those who like sweeter, milder, curries, or someone new to curries, perhaps.

Sooooo good! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I used a vegetarian "chicken." I added steamed green beans. I realized after I ate it that I forgot to add the sugar, but I loved it anyway!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it didn't taste like curry at all.  I made it exactly yo the recipe.  It didn't taste bad, just bland.  I'm going to try it again because I feel like I must have done something wrong.  It has such great reviews from everyone else.

Yum. I liked it even better reheated.  I would say that the taste was good but not very strong. We added a little red pepper but next time we'll use more curry and pepper to give it some zip. I drained my tomatoes and used lite coconut milk.  I cut up a zuchini, red bell pepper and 2 carrots and threw them in the pan as everything was simmering. Served over rice and it was good.

I really had no idea what to expect, so I thought it was okay. Not bad but needs more flavor. Will probably make again & add some more seasoning. Served over white rice.

I have always had a dislike of Indian food (despite my love for spicy) but I decided to give this a try anyway... and I am so glad I did!! This is freakin' awesome.  I used lite coconut milk, and added a julienned red bell pepper as well (sauteed with the onions). I also added a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes at the end, just because I like things spicy.  i served this with instant brown rice that I cooked with coconut milk (lite) instead of water.  I love this! I've eaten the leftovers twice and am still looking forward to eating them tomorrow again for lunch! I will make this again and again, despite my apartment smelling of curry. :)

This dish makes me smile!  I used two different curries one hot 2t and 2T regular and I also added green pepper chunks.  Next time I'm going to add pineapple like my favorite restaurant does.   My whole family loved this even the 8 year old who is hard to please.  If you love Thai food...then don't hesitate to make this.

This is very good.  I made it according to the recipe except for omitting the onion.  I also broke up the tomatoes with a hand blender because my kids freak over chunky tomatoes.  It seemed fairly runny after simmering for an hour.  I was planning to serve over rice - I had some leftover in the fridge from a recent Chinese carry-out - but I decided to mix the rice right in.  That took care of the thinness and made it a perfect consistency.  I will be making this again.

You have to LOVE curry to love this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and this was too much curry for me.  But that is nothing against the recipe, it is supposed to have a strong curry taste.  So next time, I will use only 1 tablespoon of curry.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I thought this dish was great- I loved the taste & aroma the curry added. The leftovers were so good the next day! This is a keeper in my book but for some reason my BF did not enjoy- I think the curry off-set him & the fact I mentioned there was coconut milk in it. Too bad- this will become a regular staple during a few months.

Made this tonight to rave reviews. Used less  chicken, but added a can of chickpeas.  Subbed a can of Rotel with chilis for the canned tomatoes and a can of tomato paste for the sauce.  Thickened up beautifully!  Also prefer brown over white sugar. I served this over basmati and it was wonderful!

WOW!  I made this dish almost vegetarian ( cutting back on meat).  Used 4 tenderloins, one stalk of celery, large onion and large yellow pepper.  Used Light Coconut Milk, and I wish I did not add the three Splenda packets b/c it was a little too sweet.  I added more curry to taste.  This will be a regular meal in our house!!    PS - will make this vegetarian next time and add cauliflower.

Very yummy and easy.  I omitted the tomato sauce the 1st time I made this, and left out the onion, garlic, tomato sauce and sugar the 2nd time (in a hurry), and it was still great.  This will definitely be a family favorite (all the kids ate it - ages 1, 3 and 5).

Made this for the family tonight.  Hubby thought it was too sweet - was expecting a traditional spicy curry.  Daughter and I really liked it but it was kind of sweet.  To keep from having the super liquidy sauce complained about in a few of the other reviews. I used tomato paste instead of the tomatoes and tomato sauce.  It was nice and thick without the 40 minute simmer time.  Served with jasmine rice, I thought it was very yummy!

I think this has a lot of potential.  I think the tomato overwhelmed the coconut flavor.  I will definitely make this again, but I'll scale back on the tomato sauce just a bit.

I made this tonight for my husband- delicious!!  I followed the recipe with unsweetened coconut milk and took the advice of Cook Stephanie by cooking curry paste in oil to start.  I couldn't wait for the sauce to thicken, so I mixed some flour and water and added it to the pan.  It thickened quickly after that.  I added fresh basil at the end, and we served with naan and brown rice.  We have enough chicken leftover for lunch tomorrow, and plenty of sauce to make another curry later!  Fabulous recipe!!

Delicious!  I used lite coconut milk to cut back on fat and calories and this was still very good and rich.  I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth (instead of the tomato sauce) and diced potatoes and carrots and fresh chopped cilantro.  Perfect served over freshly steamed rice!

I was searching for a highly rated curry chicken receipt. With no luck, I decided to try this one. I used aprox 1 pound of chicken ( just cooking for me and bf). I can't imaging how you would have enough sauce using 2 pounds of chicken. I HIGHLY recommend simmering WITHOUT a lid. I had a prefect creamy sauce in about 30 minutes. It was on the bland side like some had said. The dish is obviously on the sweeter side if it calls for sugar and coconut milk but I like a " sweet and salty " mixture and this dish was a little too sweet for my liking...but my bf had three servings!

As is, I give this four stars because it is a bit too sweet for my pallet. Next time, I'll probably cut the sugar in half since the coconut milk itself is sweet already. Otherwise, it is a very simple and delicious recipe! Will definitely make again - but with less sugar!

I made this tonight.  My son said,"it's almost perfect."  He's never said that.  He just walked by and said,"are you saving the rest of the curry?" "I think I'll have it tomorrow."  He's never said that either.  I think I'll add some sliced green peppers and bamboo shoots next time.  Thank you!

I was not particularly crazy about this, but I won't blame it on the recipe. While cooking this the aroma reminded me of a Panang curry and so my taste buds were expecting something else. Totally not the fault of the recipe. My bf said it was pretty good therefore explaining my rating. He said he would eat it again if prepared, but I am not sure I want to play whodini with my taste buds again.

We loved this. I added more onions, garlic and curry powder and about a tsp of cayenne pepper. I also cooked the curry powder in the oil for 5 mins first and the onions and garlic for another 10 before I added the rest of the ingredients. Simmered for an hour and 20 mins with the lid off and it was thick and so good!

I love this recipe.  I have used cubed boneless skinless chicken breast and also thighs, skinless, but with the bone.  Both are very good, but I think the thighs are much juicier and have more flavor.  I also added a cup of peas just as the sauce was thickening,so they were not over cooked.  You really can't beat how easy this is.

this has become my go to curry base recipe, although every time i cook it i use different veggies, beans, etc. I don't eat chicken so I leave that part out. I usually do as another user said and add the curry powder to the oil first and let it cook a spell before adding the onion, I also use crushed tomatoes instead of diced, and i like to add a little chopped jalepeno to kick it up...but all in all, a very easy base recipe...you can also substitute agave nectar or cane sugar for the sugar, or leave the sugar out altogether and its still pretty sweet.

I followed the recipe but wish I would have added a tad more curry. Like others, I could smell curry (though not unplesant) in my kitchen for 2-3 days afterward.  The sauce was a little thin but it worked out well on the rice so no complaints on that.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Soooo good with red curry paste! I cooked the paste and oil (peanut and canola) for about 5 minutes, added onion & garlic and cooked another 5 minutes. I sprinkled some garam masala, cumin, s& p on the chicken and browned it before adding everything else. (used about 1 1/2 Tlb os sugar and it was perfect). EXCELLENT with peas and basamati rice!

I made this with tofu, and it was perhaps the best curry I have made.  I have to admit I made a few changes, including the addition of 1/2 tsp cayenne powder, ~2 tsp fresh ginger, an additional three garlic cloves, an additional tablespoon curry powder, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and an additional 1/2 to 1 tsp salt. I also omitted the tomato sauce and used fresh roma tomatoes.   Intense, hot flavor - delicious over rice!

This was absolutely amazing. My bf LOOOOOOOOVED IT!!!!! A definite MUST for everyone to try. The taste, the texture of the chicken it was perfect. I actually added stewed tomatoes (not diced) the tomatoes picked up and absorbed all the delicious sauce. I also added a tbsp. of red pepper flakes to make it a bit spicy. Wow! It was truly fantastic. Tonight I am making 12 servings and taking it to a little family get together.

Instead of using oil and curry powder, I used the cream at the top of the can of coconut milk and sauteed that with 2T of Thai red curry paste until fragrant. Curry paste is more authentic than curry powder.  I ended up with about 2 cups of extra sauce so I would use the suggestion of "whatarat" reviewer and add cut up zucchini and carrot (1-2 each) to make it a one-pot dish. Ending up with extra thickened sauce is a great result - you can freeze leftover sauce to make a repeat dazzling dish!

We really enjoyed this.  My 1 year old ate it really well.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the sugar.  Noticed it when Hubby was going back for seconds, so I added 1 Tbls then.  Great either way.  Didn't have any trouble with the sauce not thickening.  I also ended up adding a cut up zuchinni with the chicken and chopped carrot - we love our veggies!

My bf took a fork and the entire pot and sat down to eat! I used a 2nd can of stewed tomatoes, used paste instead of sauce, and didn't use sugar. For spices I added cumin, red pepper flakes, ginger, garlic powder, and doubled the curry powder. I also added carrots, celery, potatoes, extra onion, and green peppers. This is just delicious! Our house doesn't smell too bad (windows are all open) today either.

Yummy! I did not follow the recipe to the T but did these: 1. Used chicken quarters and cut them up in good chunks 2. Omitted pepper as I just ran out of it 3. Used canned whole tomatoes and the juice too and break them with the spatula as they were cooking (not too mushy though)  4. Used plenty of tomato juice as I had no tomato sauce, it gave the curry a fragrant smell and the colour looked great too 5. Omitted the sugar 6. Added cinnamon sticks  They were so good that I was going for 'seconds' an hour after lunch!

Maybe I didn't season the chicken enough. I thought my chicken didn't have any flavor, but my family liked the recipe. I agree that you should increase the curry powder by 50%. I added crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit. I also added some shredded coconut to this recipe. I had leftover coconut from a coconut cookie recipe on this site.

This was awesome! I love curry, and am mostly used to a more Indian style curry, but this was spectacular. Needs to be served with rice or veggies or something but not by itself.  It has quite a bit of sauce that requires it. Also freezes and bakes up very well.

A nice and simple recipe but I made a few modifications to suit my taste. I added about 2 tbsp more curry powder and 1 tsp salt than was called for. I also added a cut up potato, green pepper and some fresh broccoli towards the end of the cooking process. I like a bit more heat so I added a squirt of Sirachi sauce and it was just perfect!!!

I made the recipe last night and while it was good it needed more flavor and was not as spicy as I hoped.. This recipe might be a good introduction to someone who has never had Indian food before. The next time I make it I'll add in more curry and a few extra spices.

I used 3 pounds of chicken, 1 large onion (it reduces down and adds a nice flavor), and unsweetened light coconut milk. Simmer about 50-60 minutes, taking the cover off about halfway through to slightly thicken. Serve over plenty of rice. Top with toasted coconut flakes! Thanks Roma, it's easy and a keeper. Couple of us licked the bowl:)

This was amazing.  I used about a half jar (about 3-4 tablespoons) of curry paste instead of the powder.  And served this over brown rice.  I've made it twice so far and barely have leftovers!

Very good and very simple to make.  I followed the directions exactly.  My only complaint is the strong smell of the curry throughout the house that is nearly impossible to get rid of.

LOVE IT !!!!  I've never made anything with coconut milk in it and this was great!!!  Not sure what the one comment about sweetened vs. unsweetened coconut milk was.  I got original coconut milk and it turned out great.

I thought this was pretty good.  I don't think I'll add sugar next time.  I did take a hint from other reviews and cooked the curry with oil for about 5 minutes first.  I also added a potatoe and some cayenne pepper.  I think I will also use red curry paste next time for some more heat.  Thanks for making curry easy!

We love this recipe at our house, simple to make with exotic flavors.  I usually add lemongrass...or a little bit of lime juice to add some sour to the mix...this is essential to balance the sweet of the coconut milk and sugar.

Loved this recipe. I read through the reviews & took advice from different people. I basically followed the recipe outline but adjusted things to my liking. I didn't have curry power so I used equal parts cumin, coriander, turmeric, & chilli powder. I doubled the onions which I cooked until soft & light golden brown. I added tomato paste as I didn't have sauce on hand. I used fresh tomatoes instead of stewed diced tomatoes as I really don't care for canned vegetables. I also added 1 red bell pepper chopped up. My husband & I like our food spicy so I added Thai chili paste (aka Rooster Sauce as we call it) & 3 dried red chillies. Sounds really spicy but with the caramelized onions, sweet red pepper, & fresh tomatoes, you get the heat but it doesn't burn your mouth. My husband & I loved it with white basmati rice.

I followed some other reviews and omitted the tomato sauce and used lite coconut milk.  I think next time I'll use the regular coconut milk. I didn't think it had enough coconut flavor to it.  I also doubled the curry and added some cayenne and red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. I thought this was great and it was even better the next day as a leftover served over brown rice.

Love this recipe!  It was easy to make, and my husband and I really enjoyed it!  Definitely don't be worried about the amount of curry spice added.  It was wonderful!  I did add petite peas and reduced the sugar to 2T.  I also followed another person's suggestion and cooked the curry in the oil longer and left the sauce simmering uncovered.  Will make again!  Thanks!!

this was good i would make again but with changes. i used dices tomatoes and next time try crushed. too sweet, cut back on sugar to 1 tblsp. good over white rice, others suggested egg noodles.  2/16: this made a lot of sauce so when there was 5 min left i added some shrimp, and frozen peas, very good.

It was a good basic recipe, but for someone who eats a lot of curry it isn't 100% satisfying but quick and easy enough if you don't want to put the time or effort into making a more flavorful curry.

This was a very easy and healthy way to infuse coconut into my diet.  It is quick and delicious!!!!  I found some chicken broth with Thai Curry flavor and used it to cook the accompanying rice.  The flavored rice complimented the dish well. This got rave reviews from my husband.

WOW!  I will make this weekly from now on!  After reading other reviews, I decided to use 1 lb. chicken but left everything else the same.  I added about 3 red potatoes (cubed), 1/2 a bell pepper, 1 yellow squash, 1.5 teaspoons garam masala, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, & 11 drops Stevia instead of sugar.  I cooked the onions until they were translucent as suggested by one of the reviews, and I think that really opened up the curry.  It simmered for 30 minutes covered, then 10 minutes uncovered.  I like a good amount  of sauce, so it came out just right... but it will be necessary to add veggies if you use the same chicken to sauce ratio.  YUM!

I love Curried Chicken, but this recipe was a little bland. The first time I made it, it was too tomato-y and thin, so the second time, I used a little tomato paste in place of the tomatoes and sauce. It helped thicken the sauce and flavor it well. The second time I also added more salt and pepper to the sauce which gave it more flavor. Tossing in some cauliflower rounded the recipe well.

I had to give it four stars ONLY because I changed it a little bit.  This is a good recipe doubled because left overs the next night are VERY flavorfull!

I added half chicken and half shrimp (but only add the shrimp at the end so it wouldn't be chewy).  I also added 1 small can of bamboo shoots, and about 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms.  Cut down the tomato sauce by about 1/4 (because my husband doesn't like tomato sauce at all), and then served it over fried rice.

It was amazing.  The only thing I will do different next time is make it more spicy and even add a little more coconut milk.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

YUM!!  My husband ate half of this himself.  He said I could make it any night.  The only thing I did different was I added another tablespoon of sugar and a tad more curry powder.  I served with basmati rice.  It was DELISH!

This was really good as is but next time I will add a little less sugar because at first it was a little overpowering.  After simmering for a whle it really came out delicious.

The only thing I had to change was I only had a can of diced tomato and no tomato sauce.  because of the excess sugar taste I decided to add a couple of spoons of plain marinara sauce (which is basically tomato sauce with a little olive oil anyway)

I had so much left over I threw in a can of chick pease to the left overs and ate some for lunch the next day it was delicious! I froze the rest and can get at least another 2 meals out of it!

fantastic recipe! I made a few modifications- I used 1 pound of chicken and added chunks of red potatoes. the recipe was really easy, which is important to me. I simmered the curry for an hour uncovered, and the curry thickened quite nicely! Thanks!

This was great!  I especially loved the flavors and how easy it was to make.  The only thing I would add is that the Indian food that I've had in the past had a lot more heat and if that is what you would desire, you could add 1 chopped jalapeno.

This was a great base recipe, but I did modify it considerably based on other reviews.  I made the curry "broth" that one reviewer mentioned, and I think it really did positively affect the outcome (I used curry paste and curry powder).  Three tablespoons of sugar would have definitely been an overload of sweetness, at least for our tastes.  I added about a teaspoon, which balanced the flavors perfectly and took away some of the acidity from the tomatoes.  I also added some more spices - tumeric and a pinch of cardamom - as I felt it was a bit bland without them.    

The mister loved this dish and so did I.  I think it would also make a lovely vegetarian meal if various veggies and potatoes were added in place of the chicken.  The leftovers were also great!  Thanks for a great starting point.  I can't wait to try a few other variations of this recipe.

Delicious.
I didn't have any tomato paste, so I just used a can of chopped tomatoes in tomato juice. I added more curry powder and some white pepper and paprika too. 
And at the end, added some potato.
Turned out GREAT.

Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious! It defintiely needs salt or it is on the bland side, and I felt something else was missing too that could have given it a little more oomph!  Followed the recipe exact and took some of Cook Stephanie's advice.  Beware that this dish may make you and your house smell like curry for a while.  Was a huge hit with the family and will definitely make it again.

have made this recipe about four times and have tweaked it a little...i didn't add sugar because it was sweet enough with the coconut milk, and i don't cover the pan while it's simmering so it doesn't take so long.  my family loves this recipe!

I really liked this recipe, I added extra curry powder and some ground cayenne pepper to give it a little more of a bite.  I also thickened it a little with a water/flour mixture I use to thicken my sauces.  I will be cutting the chicken into smaller pieces and adding some extra next time because I will definitely be making this again!

LOVED IT !!!  My son is a very fussy eater, and he loves this dish.  I've made it several times it's one of the few that he requests.  It's got wonderful flavor, it's easy to make, and it's fairly quick with out a lot of fuss.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste, lite coconut milk and simmered for about an hour. I also used 1 1/2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce (I didn't drain the tomatoes) which I think was a mistake because it got more gravy than curry-like. While the flavor was really good, it was pretty tomato-y so I would do 1/4 the tomato sauce to avoid this next time. Otherwise really good and easy! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed along with the other reviewer and made the curry sauce with the curry paste (not powder) first before adding the tomatoes, chicken, milk, and tomato sauce. It does make a huge difference. It tasted wonderful! I had family over and they all loved it.

My 10 year old daughter proclaimed this was the "best dinner ever".  I agree.  It was easy and tasty.  The only change I made was to add 1 heaping tsp of corn starch to slightly thicken the sauce.

This is wonderful and quite easy to prepare.  Have made it 3 times now and we love it best with some chopped canned pineapple thrown in half-way through simmering time, it really brings out the "tropical" flavor even more.  Also, a high-quality curry powder is essential, the first time I made this I used a cheap one and it wasn't nearly as good.  I also added a dash of paprika but everything else was the same.  Thanks a lot for a great recipe that I will keep making!

As suggested I also "cooked" the curry spices and onion at the beginning.  I added carrots and celery after the onion and before the chicken and stir fried about 5 minutes.  I used tinned diced tomatoes and tomato paste instead of soup.  I omitted the sugar completely.  Everyone in my fussy family liked it.  It isn't necessarily "authentic" but it has a pleasant taste, everyone eats it and I can get 4 vegetables into them (onion, carrot, celery, tomato) as well as coconut. I thought it was a bit more Malaysian style than Indian or Thai but I am certainly not an expert in this area.  
On the down side, it was too soupy despite my efforts to reduce it, so I might try smaller amounts of coconut and tinned tomatoes next time.  It was also a little bland (no doubt this is WHY the kids ate it). Also we did try it with a little coriander leaf but it didn’t really work.

Delicious- I wanted to use up some coconut milk I had leftover from another dinner, so I tried this and we LOVED it.  I also added some peas and served on top of quinoa pasta shells instead of rice.  Can't wait to have it again!

Overall, it was a pretty good recipe.  It did seem like it was missing something.  My friend told me that the retaurant she goes to said the key is thai basil.  I will be sure to add some next time plus more curry.

This was my first attempt at anything with curry and I loved it!  I chopped up 2 cans of whole tomatoes instead of stewed & paste, and my chicken was marinated in curry and yogurt overnight.  My only complaint is that it was a bit soupy, but I liked it that way....delicious!  I served it with egg noodles the first night and rice the next.  Next time I will definitely add some heat, this is a milder curry flavor.

The curry flavor was really good thanks to some reviews I followed. I cooked the curry in  olive oil for a few minutes and added the onions and garlic and cooked it until onions were transparent.  Then added the chicken pieces.  The  one thing I did change was I added 2 cups dicd tomatoes because I didn't have any stewed tomatoes or tomato sauce.  It still came out tasty though. Will be making this again and will probably try adding in stewed tomatoes.

This is a nice, tasty, basic curry dish.  It was a little too soupy, so if I made it again I'd leave out the small can of tomato sauce.  I used coconut oil instead of veg.  I added the whole onion.  Served with brown jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.  Garnished with fresh cilantro, which was a nice addition.

This is a pretty good recipe, but as another reviewer stated, there is something missing.  I did omit the tomato sauce, but added a tablespoon or so of tomato paste b/c it is what I had on hand.  I also omitted the sugar.  I didn't think the sugar was needed since I thought the sugar was to reduce the acid taste from the tomato sauce.  I did "cook" the curry in the oil before adding the onions, etc.  I also added about a cup of peas as another person suggested.  I will probably make again, but may add more curry or some other Indian spices.

Quite good recipe, though it felt as though it was missing something..needed more dimension?  Overall a good little staple recipe.  I followed the suggestion to roast the curry with oil, and it definitely increased its fragrance. I decreased the sugar to 1 tbsp, but think next time will use 2 tbsp.  As suggested to reduce liquid, I drained the tomatoes.  I simmered covered for 15 minutes, added some peas, then simmered uncovered for another 15 minutes.  The sauce thickened nicely as a result.  Next time I will also try more garlic, curry, and a touch more salt to enhance the tomato flavor.

I've been looking for a good recipe to satisfy my curry cravings. This recipe is very similar to my favorite curry dish I always order at a local Indian restaurant. I'm going to have to start making this weekly!!

This recipe is really good. The coconut milk gives it a little sweet taste. I used bone-in chicken vs. boneless and it still turned out really good. I will make this again for sure. Maybe for the family :)

I never follow a recipe exactly and just realised that I didn't add sugar in my curry however it's a very good base for any curry, you can play with it and add vegetables like green beans and cauliflower yummi yummmi!

This recipe was so delicious, I had to race my husband back to the kitchen to make sure I got some leftovers for the next day's lunch.  We cooked the broth for about ten minutes, reduced the sugar to 1.5 tablespoons, and followed the rest of the recipe.  The sauce thickened beatifully after simmering uncovered for 40 minutes, even though we used the light coconut milk.  A keeper!  This is definitely the best Caribbean style curry we have made.

We liked this recipe okay.  The thing I liked least about this recipe is how my house reeks of curry! I used the stove fan on high and opened windows and still the smell permeates...

And the dish itself did not have a distinct curry flavor.  I couldn't taste the coconut milk at all.  Kind of a disappointment.  Turned out more like a stew with a curry aftertaste.  Tasted fine, I'd just try another next time.

this was a wonderful recipe.  although i did change and add things a bit.  i doubled the amt of curry. seasoned the chicken with a 1 clove of garlic(crushed) along w/ the s+p.  i increased the amt of onions. 2 med. i also added a sprig of fresh thyme,2T of fresh cilantro, 2 sweet peppers(chopped).  i only added half the can of tomato sauce.  i think thats plenty.  i threw in some potatoes and carrots. it defintly needs extra salt esp if you add the veggies.  i couldn't taste the coconut so i added 1-2T of shredded coconut at the end. i served it with basmati rice.  everyone love it!!

i followed this recipe to a T and it turned out excellent. i was a little worried because my first time making it was for a few guests, but i figured it must be good because of the reviews. everyone seemed to enjoy it, and even went for seconds. i will be making this again, but might add peas or potatoes next time. thanks for a great recipe!

We just finished eating this for supper.  VERY Good!  Our boys loved it.  We made a vegetarian version with veggie chicken.

We doubled the sauce and added broccoli. The broccoli was a nice addition.  I ate my last bowl without rice…kind of like a chicken, broccoli, curry, coconut soup!

Great recipe... 

Thanks for sharing

God bless!

This was excellent!  It was so tasty and easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of some reviews and added half the tomato sauce, less sugar, cilantro and sprinkled cashews over before serving.  I made Curried Rice Pilaf (from this site) to go with it and it was an excellent combination.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

If rated solely on ease of prep, this would get five stars. It's the easiest curry recipe ever. It was tasty but lacked something. If I make this again, I will add more onion and perhaps some green  pepper and red pepper flakes. I added cumin to season the chicken before cooking this dish. I didn't have coconut milk but I did have a can of cream of coconut on hand. I used 1/2 a 15oz can of cream of  coconut and about half a cup of milk. The sauce was a little thin at the end, so I did the old corn starch and water mixture; thickened right up. Fair warning:  I'm burning candles and airing the house out from the lingering curry smell left from last night.

This is one of my favorite curry recipes, I've been making it for over a year now to rave reviews. The great thing is, it's so simple, I recently was running late, got home and threw the chicken in the microwave for a a  minute to speed up the cooking, and got the whole meal done in the time it took the rice to cook:

This is so good, I made it a couple weeks ago and I have craved it ever since.  The only thing I did different was to add a teaspoon of coconut extract for a little extra coconut flavor, which I love.

I think this recipe is terrific although I tweaked a little bit - I added the juice of 1/2 lime and also added about 1/3 - 1/2 c. of chopped cilantro and simmered for about 30 minutes.  I used fresh chicken tenders and did not cut into chunks, I think the presentation looked better. Served over Basmati rice pilaf and it was fabulous.

This was really good. I did make a change & that was I used regular milk and then added about 1 tsp of coconut extract. The flavor was great that way. I also recommend a tsp or so of salt & next time I won't add tomatoes or at least a full can. That many tomatoes was too much and it made the curry more orange than the traditional yellow color.

I just cooked this for dinner, enjoyed it, however its the curry flavour doesnt come through that strong, however I am from a malaysian background.  

I found taking your white rice, frying it with garlic, salt and pepper and adding a touch of thin oyster sauce was nice on the side.  

Next time i'd probably try halving the amount of tomato  sauce going in, it was slightly overpowering in my opinion.

This recipe is really good. I made it for a large group and it worked out really well although I ended up using alot more coconut milk than it called for. A good curry dish for those who don't always eat curry.

This was so good! Even my picky five year old loved it! I added potatoes and carrots to mine to make it more complete. Next time I will reduce the sugar just a tad....maybe by a tbs. Will for sure be making this again.

I made this recipe over the weekend for my husband and I. We really liked the flavor of it prior to adding the sugar. Afterwards we thought it was too sweet but the jasmine rice I made to go with the dish helped to cut it a bit. I felt the liquid could have been a little thicker(it got thicker slightly the next day). The next day the dish tasted the same to me but my husband swears it got sweeter. Also the next day after eating the leftovers we both got terrible heartburn. I don't why or even if it had anything to do with the food but I thought I would warn people just the same. Next time I make this dish I will cut the liquid by 1/3 and omit the sugar.  By the way I added 1 diced red bell pepper to the rest of the ingredients.

I thought this recipe was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I had some doubts about the amount of curry, but it was fine.  Even my daughter who doesn't like curry enjoyed this recipe.  I will draim the diced tomatoes next time and might try some hot red peppers!

This was pretty good. I have several young children, and it was not their favorite, so I probably will not be making again. I'll stick to my "Country Captian Chicken" Recipe

This recipe way okay (hence the 3 stars) - not spectacular, not offensive.  I was a little curious with so much curry required, how so many reviewers said that it was bland.  Well - it's true.  I didn't have a soupiness problem (I did drain the tomatoes and didn't add the tomato sauce) and it was nicely juicy to complement the rice.  The flavor, however, was definately lacking.  I had to add salt, more garlic salt, additional pepper, and a whole bunch of red pepper (and I'm cooking for a picky husband, a 7 year old, a 5 year old, and a 3 year old).  We're not spicey-food people.  With some tweaking, this recipe could be upped a star but with so many other yummerific options on this site, it didn't impress us enough that I'll spend the time trying to perfect a mediocure dish.

YUM!!!  This was a nice, mild curry.  I followed the directions- with a few modifications.  I added some tumeric and cloves to the curry as it was frying- added red pepper to the onions and garlic as it sauteed and a potato as it was simmering- finally to finish- I added some peas ( I LOVE veggies in my curries).  Came out a little too sweet for us- we're VERY SPICY people.  What I'm going to do when I make this again is get some really good curry- not just the 'run of the mill' curry from the grocery store.  Hopefully that will give us the complexity of spices we were both looking for.  All that being said, this was DELICIOUS and SOOOOOO EASY!  Thank you!

This was perfect. My husband loved it. The only thing I changed was added mushrooms, and also did not put in as much sugar. Thanks for one of our new favorites.

Tasty. I didn't change a thing, but had to simmer longer (1.5 hrs) to let some of the juices evaporate and for it to get thicker. It's very runny. Curry flavor was there, but the coconut flavor was lacking. Next time I think I might add some shredded coconut for more flavor. Just had more today and the leftovers are great! Sauce was nice and thick! I served over Jasmine rice. Definitely will make it again.

I love this recipe!!  The longer you let it sit, the better it tastes.  Even better the next day.  I love how runny it is.  I make Jasmine rice and put it over that.  Everyone I make this for loves it!  Thanks for the Recipe!

This was a very nice dish. It is definetly restarant grade food. the nice thing is that the chicken becomes soft and nicely soaked through. I would recommend serving on rice and with a salad

My husband and I thought this was a nice curried chicken, the only change I made was I drained the stewed tomatoes because I was afraid it would be too runny.  It tasted excellent though.

I added a yellow pepper and used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  I threw in more curry powder as I didn't find it very spicy.  I also added a little ginger and some chili pepper flakes.  I think I would add more salt in the future and maybe use brown sugar instead of normal sugar.

One of the most delicious dishes EVER! I added much more curry and a few teaspoons of cayenne (only because I'm totally in love with spicy food) but I loved it.

I'll have to admit, I was VERY nervous about making this.  I love chicken curry but have never made it before, thinking it would be way out of my league since I'm not extraordinary in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, I found this recipe to be very tasty, but my husband and I both agreed that it was missing "something", but we couldn't figure out what.

I added carrots, red bell peppers and green onions.  Next time, I will leave the carrots out, I didn't care for them at all in this dish.  The bell peppers and scallions were nice, though.  I used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3.  I also added a sprinkle of garlic powder and cayenne pepper and used a bit more curry...I was trying to figure out what this was missing!!

My husband said "this was good, make it again, but it wasn't great".  If I could figure out the ingredient that this dish is missing that would make it great, I'd give it 5 stars!!!

We loved this recipe and tweaked it to our tastes...added carrots, mushrooms, green pepper and doubled the garlic.  Hubby likes his hot so he sprinkled on some cayenne pepper.  I actually got two of my three young kids to at it too.

I used a lot of the hints from other reviewers and this turned out so good I brought the leftovers to work to share.  I left out the tomato paste but added some roasted red chili paste,  Also added carrots, celery, cayanne pepper, cumin, and ginger.  Next time I will add a little more heat to it and it will be perfect!

This was my first try at curry and my last. It smelled great, unfortunately we can still smell it the next day, and the aroma made my 17 year old vegatarian retch.It was edible, I guess we just don't care for curry.Otherwise as far as recipes go, it turned out good since I followed some suggestions of the other reviewers.

This is the first recipe I have tried on this website and I am hooked! It was delicious, super easy and impressed my fiancee. I added a clove more garlic and used fresh chopped tomatoes rather than canned. I like the ideas others have suggested to add bell pepper and will most likely try this. However, I think if you follow all ingredients to a tee you will still be completely happy. Thank you so much ROMA80 for making my first attempt so successful!!!

I tend to dislike anything hot and spicy, however I found this dish did not have a high amount of heat and had just the right amount of spice. It was perfect for me, but for those who love heat will probably want to add extra ingredients. Also, I added green onions instead of regular onions, bok choy, and twice the amount of stewed tomatoes simply b/c I love tomatoes. Also I used lite coconut milk and did not run into any problems with the dish being too sweet, it had a very balanced sweetness to it. Finally, I served the dish over some jasmine rice. For my first curry dish EVER this was fabulous! I will make this again for sure, but will add even more veggies.

First time i reviewed this i gave it 4 stars, but since then, I've made this several times and we really like it at our house. i like to add a few things to it while it's cooking - like whatever i have on hand - usually green peppers, celery, potatoes - all diced up - it serves well over rice. So I'd like to change my rating from 4 stars to 5*****

Excellent recipe! I used low fat coconut milk and added broccoli and cauliflower while it was simmering. Served it with basmati rice - delicious!

VERY simple recipe!  I had bought some Yellow Indian Curry a couple weeks ago, and tonight was looking for a recipe that I could use it with and not have to make a trip to the grocery.  Tasted just like what I had at the a local Thai place a few weeks ago!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good, I made some adjustments though.  I only used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, and left out the tomato sauce. I used less chicken and added half a red and half a orange bell pepper, and brocolli.  I also added some hot chile peppers for some spice.  I would definitely make this again.

This dish was delicious.  I added 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper when I made it because it didn't seem spicy enough.  That added just enough spice, I thought.  The sauce also seemed a bit watery. Next time I make it I'll also add 1 tsp of salt and drain the tomatoes.

Definitely really good. Based on other people's reviews, I didn't add the tomato sauce and added 2 spoons of sugar instead of 3. I will do a few things differently next time. I will add a little more curry (you could barely feel it there and we like our food spicy!) and I will go with the original 3 spoons of sugar. We are big fans of really sweet curried dishes so I feel with those modifications it will be just perfect. Finally, the sauce - I wish there was more! I love my rice soaked in sauce and even though all the reviews were mentioning there is too much sauce - I didn't think so at all. Great recipe - thank you!!

Variations: No tomato sauce or sugar added, used a whole sweet onion, threw in some ground red pepper, and added carrot and celery slices while simmering.

My husband and I were _very_ pleased! Thank you for the recipe, ROMA80.

Great recipe.  I added extra curry to the recipe since it was a little sweet.  Be forewarned, your kitchen will smell like curry for at least 3 days.  Still, I found it worth it!

I am not a huge fan of curry (I like just a hint or so of it), and I loved this dish.  My kids ate it up and even asked for seconds (including the 11 month old).  I found it was quite soupy, but because we had it over rice it soaked up nicely.  I will definatly make this again.

I added a little more heat than called for and I added a couple bay leaves, served it over jasmine rice, huge hit! Re-heats the next day for yummy aeromatic leftovers leaving my co-workers wish I had rought some for everyone. This one is easy, exotic and delicious.

We used chicken thighs and legs with the skin removed.  The smell was fragrant, the taste delicious and the meat fell off the bone!

I couldn't taste the coconut quite enough, so I may add more next time.

This smelled delicious while it was cooking, but it tasted SO bland. I added all the curry powder I had plus some garam masala, and it still wasn't up to much. I added salt, garlic powder and a splash of hot sauce. Better, but still not great. Husband was indifferent which is never a good sign. I doubt I'll make it again.

This was wonderful served with basmati rice and steamed green beans.  My DH couldn't get enough.  I loved the slight sweetness from the coconut milk.  I tasted the sauce before finishing, and decided not to add the extra sugar.  We also added some Thai Red Curry to our plates for a little heat.  I did not do this for the whole dish as to make kid friendly. Will make again for sure.  Thanks so much for the post.

5 Stars for sure!  I MADE THIS LOW-FAT!!!
I substitued Lite Coconut Milk (using the lowest fat/cals available, they are not all equal) and I cut the sugar in half and used splenda.  This was phenomenal and I don't mean "for a low-fat meal"...I mean this was by far THE BEST curry I've made (and I consider myself a curry conisseur!) and rates right up there with the best I've eaten in a restaurant...perhaps even better!  My kids (7&9) LOVED it too.  Thank you! 

Note:  for newbie curry cooks, make sure you dissolve the curry in the oil to avoid a very unpleasant gritty texture.

The fresher the curry, the better!  If you know someone serving over in the gulf right now...ask them to pick you up some curry...I got stocked up in at is THE BEST stuff I've ever used!

Overall, a rich, filling, delicious recipe - BUT ADD VEGGIES!!!  I made this VEGETARIAN by substituting tofu for the chicken.  I took the suggestion of other reviews and omitted the tomato sauce, but used a TBL of tomato taste to add some richness.  I also don't like savory dishes being too sweet so I omitted the sugar and found that the coconut milk adds enough sweetnes.

SO good!  Tastes very much like a curry I always get at a Thai restaurant in AZ. I added a little bit more sugar and will try adding some cubbed potatoes and sliced carrots next time I make it, as they do in the restaurant.  Delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Drained the tomatoes and added more curry, eggplant and red and green peppers.  I only added a sprinkle of sugar, and some fresh pepper and a little allspice.  It was soupy, but after simmering it thickened some, and I spooned it over couscous like a thick stew.  Perfect comfort food on a chilly and very stressful day.  Tons leftover to freeze, even after I had two helpings and kept eating straight from the pan.  So tasty.  I will definitely make this again, and expiriment with other vegetable and meat combinations.

Incredibly easy to follow and tastes wonderful. I know I will be making this dish for years to come- my fiance raved about it. I might play with the spiciness level, because it was a little mild. Otherwise it was perfect!

Made this last night and it  was excellent!  I did make a few changes - 1.5 tbl of curry, drained the stewed tomatoes and left out the sugar.  My house still smells great this morning.

We made this recipe tonight for the 1st time.  I took the advice of the first reviewer and used red curry paste (1 Tbsp) and simmered it in 2 Tbsp oil for about 3 minutes or so. I added fresh minced garlic and sauteed for 30 seconds then added the onion.  I sauteed until translucent, almost 10 minutes.  I then added sliced stewed tomatoes and broke apart into pieces.  I reduced the heat to low while I cooked the chicken in a seperate skillet because I wanted to get a good browning on the chicken pieces. Before cooking the chicken, I put 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/2 salt on the chicken and I decided that wasn't enough so I added a little more of each.  While chicken was browning, i sprinkled some yellow curry powder on the chicken, just enough to give it a good yellow color once stirred.  I added the rest of the ingredients (only 1 Tbsp of sugar though) to the curry, onion, and tomato skillet, then added the chicken onced browned.  I brought the entire mixture to a medium boil then reduced the heat and let simmer for 45 minutes or so to thicken up.  It was delicious!  The chicken was so tender : )

Yummy and so easy to make. Finding plain stewed tomatoes was hard so we used the spicy pepper!

This recipe is simple and great! I just added a green bell pepper to give it a little extra color and texture.

I would've had a photo but we ate it all. 
I promise you this is "That" curry recipe!!! Impress somebody with your ability to cook... when you really don't have that much skill.

Friends,  I love almost all the recipes on this app, and I have never felt the need to give a 1 star rating.  First, I followed the directions verbatim and burned the curry in the first step.  My wife thought I was burning incense.  After starting again, I found there was not enough oil, there was too much liquid, and the flavor just wasn’t great in the end.  I also found it fascinating that all reviews said the recipe was THE BOMB but everyone said they changed it for one reason or another.  The recipe as it stands, as I cooked it, needs a lot of improvement.

I made it pretty much as called for and it turned out great. I used unsweetened coconut milk and it was pretty good. It didn’t even occur to me that there are two versions of coco milk. We added a little more salt later to taste. Also I did add a little more oil. My suggestion make it once as called and tweak as desired.

It had a strong curry flavor but it was actually pretty bland. I added diced peppers to it and that didn’t make a difference. I think next time I’ll add some ginger and large chunks of sweet potato, zucchini, carrot, coconut oil instead of olive oil and some heavy cream. That way I can just eat it like a stew and maybe it will be better.

Made the recipe as is except I used curry paste instead of powder and heat it up with the oil first like another reviewer suggested. Absolutely delicious! This has become a family favorite. I now add some vegetables in like broccoli and carrots since everyone will eat it in this dish.

Worked out wonderfully, with only a few adaptations based on taste and ingredient availability.  I was quite proud to serve it to my family.  My only complaint is with the name: I almost skipped this recipe because I thought it was going to use actual coconut, not just coconut milk, and I didn't have any.

I made this exactly as written.  We were very disappointed with the results.  The flavor was almost bland.  There are several other curried coconut chicken recipes I've tried that use several more spices and have much more flavor.  Although this was very quick and easy to put together, I won't be making it again.  I love trying new recipes, so appreciate the opportunity to try this one.

It was pretty good but more bland than what I am used to. I mixed it with quinoa instead of rice. Not as good as restaurant but I would make it again, maybe with some changes. Needs more curry powder though.

This was a wonderful curry dish with just the right amount of spice to our tastes. Added 4 cubed peeled potatoes (partially cooked)and cubed zucchini squash to simmering stew. Used 3 garlic cloves, but kept other ingredients as called for.

This recipe is delicious, easy to make, and relatively low-calorie if you use reduced fat coconut milk. I simmered covered for a full hour and continued simmering uncovered for an additional hour resulting in a thick and rich sauce. I cut the onions in chucks vs. thin slices to give the dish more texture. Next time I'll try adding peas, which I think would be a nice addition. I served this over rice with roasted small carrots as a side dish and that was an excellent pairing.

Sure would be nice to be able to add these ingredients to a shopping list.  Maybe I need to find a new site to use.  This one is becoming very user unfriendly.

WAY too much tomatoes. I would cut down the tomato amount by at least three quarters. Wasn't edible until I got rid of the sauce and remedied it with some pre-made sauces I had lying around in my fridge.

This recipe was fantastic and the kids loved it! I didn’t have stewed tomatoes on hand so just omitted that part. Everything else I followed exactly and the sauce thickened up nicely. I made coconut rice to go along with this and it was perfect. Will definitely keep this recipe for repeated use. I didn’t read through any reviews before making this dish.

Made this for dinner and my girlfriend wants me to make it again this week! Definitely a new go to! I did let it cook uncovered so it thickened up a bit.

this was very nice I enjoyed it but I would have preferred more spices as I didn't get a hit of heat at all. I also didn't put the sugar in but it was good

Good and easy recipe. Mine ended up being more liquidy than I would have liked, even after letting it simmer for longer than suggested so I would use more chicken next time, but otherwise this was good.

Super easy recipe.  I will send this one off for my daughter to make in college.  I didn't have Chile de Arbol (ran out!) so I added a few red pepper flakes for a little punch.  

To do a flavor boost, I added cilantro on top and a squeeze of lime.

I wanted to make something with chicken breasts,  but I get tired of preparing it the same couple ways that I know.  This recipe was such a refreshing new way for me,  and it was delicious! I really loved the flavor combination that the tomatoes and coconut milk created! I will definitely make this again! Oh,  and I paired it with riced cauliflower, for dieting purposes instead of rice, and fresh asparagus.  Bravo to this recipe!

This has become my standard chicken curry recipe. I've served it to guests, and many have asked for the recipe. I think it is best served with Basmati rice, but my son prefers Jasmine rice. I add 1 to 2 tsp. of garam masala to the oil with the curry powder. I also throw in vegetables that I have on hand that I think will go well - chick peas, carrots (I saute them with the onion), peas, etc. The recipe is really lends itself to add-ins. Just be sure to use a large pan!

I made this for a women's group and received many compliments.  I used mild curry as some don't like things too spicy.  Also I cut the sugar by 1/3 as I don't like things too sweet.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I will make it again, but will do so in the spring and fall when I can open the windows as we could smell the curry for several days.

This is one of my favorite recipes on All Recipes so far! Savory, sweet and easy to make! Curry can be hit or miss for me, but this was just the perfect amount of curry without being overbearing. The coconut milk combo was fantastic. Definitely will be making again!

Loved it.  I thought I had Coconut Milk in cabinet, but it was  Goya Cream of Coconut.  I was a little hesitant to add all 3 Tbsp. of sugar, seemed like a lot.  But I always make the recipe exactly as written the 1st time to determine if I like it the way it's recommended.  (exception for the cream of coconut!).  I watched the video and added two red dried chilis to the stew for about 30 mins. of simmer time.  That was great too.  Very flavorful.  Only change, if I use Cream instead of milk next time, I will reduce or maybe eliminate the sugar.  Can't wait to have left overs tomorrow!

I made in my Instant Pot, so sautéd curry, onion with garlic  in olive oil and then added the chicken. Sautéd for several minutes. I then added the coconut milk and the tomatoes. I left off the tomato sauce since it looked pretty soupy and added a homemade cube of basil pesto. I covered and cooked it on “meat/ stew” setting for just 5 minutes. Since I was not simmering uncovered for 30, 40 or 50 minutes it was very soupy. Salted and peppered to taste and finished with a spritz of lime and some zest.

Really delicious recipe with delicate, complex flavors layered through each bite.  It tasted as good as the authentic curry I eat at my local Buddhist Temple.  I love curry powder, so I did add more of that than the recipe called for and added some garam masala for fun.  I'm adding this into my weekly dinner rotation.

Now you have a great go-to curry recipe!  Even better the second day.    Freezes beautifully!  I used a pound of chicken and a pound of veggies (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, summer squash, whatever you have).  Left out the sugar.  Cook UNcovered. Serve over white rice and garnish liberally with sweetened coconut and cashews.  If your curry powder is old: add another Tablespoon.

No changes done and it was ok, next time I will try to "pull" the chicken for extra crispy flavour and see if I can add real coconut pulp.

This was delicious! The ingredients were cut in half for 1lb of chicken breast. I also added a tablespoon of flour to thicken the gravy and half of a seeded jalapeño, chopped fine.  The dish was served with cilantro lime rice, which too can be found in AllRecipes. A comfort food to say the least!

A good basic curry, but we found it a little bland - perhaps a result of the curry powder we used, to be fair. Serving it with plain yogurt and lime juice along with the fresh cilantro, and omitting the sugar, was definitely an improvement to the flavour.

Really nice recipe!  I cooked it in the instant pot, so I made a few adjustments on the liquid, and sauteed ginger and jalapenos with the onions.  I used the whole can of tomatoes, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, about 3/4 of the coconut milk and added 2T of tomato paste. I did 6 minutes of pressure, 10 minute natural release. When it was done, I put in a cornstarch slurry and cooked it a few minutes to thicken up. Turned out great!

We love this recipe and make it often.  I use unsweetened coconut milk and the full 3 T of sugar. After reading other reviews, I cook the curry longer over medium heat until very dark. After the initial 20-30 minutes of cooking covered, I remove the lid and let it cook for 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. Until it really thickens up. Thank you for this recipe. Delicious!

I really love this recipe and I have made it exactly the way it was listed many times. However, if you're on a low-carb diet like I usually am, substitute the white rice for cauliflower rice (Allrecipes "Roasted Cauliflower "Rice" by Dana Sterling) and instead of adding sugar, I add Splenda. Viola! You now have a low-carb meal. Thanks Roma.

I added the 3 TBSP of sugar, and I felt like it was too sweet. I think sugar to taste is better advice, and I will probably start at 1 TBSP next time. Otherwise it tasted great and was super easy to make.

I don't know how "authentic" this is, but it's at least very tasty and very easy to make with a few adjustments: less sugar, and less tomato sauce. The amount of sugar recommended makes it way too sweet, almost sickly sweet- reduce by 1/2 to 2/3. Also there is way too much tomato sauce going on here, you'll like it better if you add about 1/2 of the suggested amount. This is a very easy 1-pan dinner, all you need to add is some rice. Tastes best when you use chicken thighs but the breasts will work too.

Made it as the recipe directed and found it to be on the sweet side. Added more garlic (I almost always have to add more garlic to everything, lol) and also added half a teaspoon of garam masala. This offset the sweetness and added a little more "authentic" Indian flavor to the dish. As my father-in-law was eating it (he can not take spicy/hot foods) I stopped at the half teaspoon, but the flavor profile could have taken up to 2ish teaspoons without  damaging the originally intended flavors. I also think  adding chili flakes/ finely diced, asian, hot peppers would pop the spice levels without breaking the base profile. I also added a little cornstarch slurry to thicken as without it the sauce was completely liquid.

This is the second time I have made this. I doubled the recipe, but made it as called for in the recipe as far as ingredients go with the exception that one of my cans of diced tomatoes was "with chiles" ...we like things a bit spicier at our house plus I had it on hand. I cooked with the lid off as another  review suggested and added an extra 10 or so minutes to the cook time (total of about 50 minutes) to help thicken the sauce slightly. This is a favorite of my kids and they begged me to make it again tonight.  I probably could have added an additional chicken breast too since there was plenty of sauce. Served with jasmine rice  and sriracha. As I made it, it had a little spice to it, but not a ton. The sriracha allows each person to increase spice levels to their liking.  A good naan bread or ciabatta artisan rolls from costco would be good with this!

This was my first attempt at a curry dish.  It was very easy and quite delicious.  Instead of a sliced onion, I used frozen seasoning blend (chopped onions, celery and peppers), and instead of raw chicken I used frozen diced grilled chicken breast.  Added some red pepper flakes and smoked paprika.  But the sugar to 1 tbl. The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  I really think that blooming the spices in the oil is the key and then allowing to simmer to thicken for awhile.  I will be adding this recipe to our dinner repertoire!  A small warning.... your home will have the lingering smell for a couple of days!

I added pineapple, cayenne pepper, and a bunch of other spices to liven things up, but the base recipe was a great starting point! Ended up tasting fantastic when served with jasmine rice.

One of my new favorite go to recipes! The only thing I did differently was add some carrots since I had them and didn’t want them to go bad and thought they tasted great. Put it over cauliflower rice and love it. Thank you for sharing such a great tasting, yet simple to make recipe!

I made  using every ingredient, except used only 1 tablespoon of sugar (rather than 3). It was delicious.... for my taste, it was sweet enough.  I simmered it over a very low flame with lid on for nearly 1 hour.  Flavors melded deliciously.  I served it with CalRose rice and sliced cucumbers on the side. The heat and cool were a perfect match.  A keeper!

I made this following all of the instructions, and to be honest I’m shocked that there are so many fantastic reviews. The recipe hardly tasted like curry and was very tomato-y. I had to add in garam masala to add some flavour but it was very bland. It wasn’t bad.. but I wouldn’t classify this as a curry. Might be good to introduce to people who aren’t used to this type of food. Probably wouldn’t make again.

I am mindful of overcooking meat.  So the chicken was still underdone when I added the coconut milk and tomatoes.  I only let it simmer about 20 minutes.  After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to add the tomato sauce.  I added about a T of tomato paste instead.  There was still a lot of fluid but it was about right to be served over rice.  For all the strong aroma there wasn't that much flavor.  Maybe it was because I forgot the sugar?  I might make it again with the sugar.  House smells of curry.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written and this is a keeper. This is one of those that will be fun to play with-I'd love to try different flavors and spices to see what happens-such a versatile recipe. I served it on top of white rice and had tangelo slices with it-the orange flavor of the tangelos was perfect. Will add this to my regular rotation.

I hate to be the one to review but say they changed things but I read the other reviews and used what I had.  I slow cooked the onion and garlic on low temperature for 10 min.  I added a full can of tomato sauce and a can of rotel diced tomatoes and peppers. I was what I had on hand. I also used Hot curry powered and used the directed amount.  It was the perfect spiciness.   I also used chicken thighs as I think they have a better flavor and are more tender than breasts.  I also added some lemongrass and fresh basil.  I did not put a lid on and simmered for about an hour and a half.  My husband loved it over rice and I had it over riced cauliflower.  It was easy to make just took some time but I would make it again.

Delish! Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne for some heat (could’ve added more) and low fat coconut milk. Didn’t have actual tomatos but used green peppers instead for some color. It was a little liquidy for my liking but still yummy when serving it over rice.

Great new dish to dry. I love that it's curry without being spicy. It was a hit! Followed the recipe exactly and served over white rice with a side salad.

Easy and very good.  As with all Indian-style recipes, the curry could be smelled through my house for two days.  But it was worth it as everyone who tried the dish loved it.

Absolutely perfect. Just followed the advice of one of the reviwers (cooking the curry well and then adding the onion till translucent). This time I didn't have enough tomatoes, so just added the tomato sauce...delish still. Will surely be making this soon again!

Soaked the chicken in baking soda water bath to tenderize it. Drained the chicken then combined it with salt, pepper and half of the curry. Cooked it separate from the sauce. Wanted to cook the sauce on its own so that I could thicken it without over cooking the chicken. Once the sauce was thick, added the cooked chicken.

I’ve made this per the recipe & it is very good; however today I changed it for our schedule & it was perfect.  Put chicken, onion, 2 diced sweet potatoes, a can of diced tomatoes & a can of chickpeas in the slow cooker. Mix can coconut milk, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 15 oz tomato sauce, 2-3 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp cumin & 1 tsp garam masala,  pour over chicken cook for 7 hours on low. Then added frozen green beans & yellow squash for last  hour. Served with homemade naan.

This was a great recipe. It takes some faith - faith that the coconut and the curry tastes will come out after simmering, and that the liquid will thicken - both of those happened and it was wonderful. I also made it alongside:

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17288/roomali-roti/

My mods were:
1) I used tomato paste instead of sauce
2) I added cayenne pepper for heat
3) I added spinach about 5-7 minutes before serving so that it would be wilted, but not overdone.

I loved the recipe. Delicious! I used boneless chicken thighs and don't like cubed chicken but shredded so I precooked the thighs in the oven with a simple marinade of garlic, olive oil, rice vinegar, and onion and then cooked them at 400 for 45 minutes, shredded the meat and mixed it into the curry after the sauce was all mixed. I didn't use quite as much sugar.

As-is it was OK. Not nearly spicy enough and way too watery/tomatoey. Next time I'm going to double the curry, and do no tomato sauce.

5 stars from everyone! 2 minor changes I made: Used sweetened shredded coconut so omitted sugar and at the end I poured in some frozen baby peas. Made it twice for different groups and it was unanimously approved.

This was surprisingly delicious.  I followed Roma’s comment in the video and added a whole hot pepper, uncut, and let the mixture simmer uncovered until it thickened.  Wow, the flavor was amazing.  My hubby raved about it.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy! Made 50 times!!Can screw it up my husband found coconut milk powder at a grocery store out of state so I used that this time and added some cream of coconut I keep in fridge for cocktails. I've never added tomato sauce if anything I may add a little tomatoe paste in tube I keep in fridge. Simmer curry powder in coconut oil if ya got it! I never use veg oil w/ this. Btw we HATE spicy food I use sweet curry powder.

Added carrots  that I previously cubed and fried in a little bit of vegetable oil and covered with a lid so they would brown and steam at the same time, and mixed it after all of the liquids were in the dish and it provided some extra sweetness. I was delicious! Nothing else to add or change!

Maybe if you’ve not eaten a lot of Indian food, or if you like tomato soup with chicken it’s good, but I found it tasted like tomato soup with curry.  No where near the delicate flavors and taste of a good curry.  Maybe cut back on the sugar, or use real tomatoes, or something.  I find a lot of recipes here on this site are now dominated by canned ingredients and usually I’m disappointed in them.  This is yet another one.

Recipe is light on spice and flavour. The coconut milk turns it into a watery boiled stew and the mix of tomatoes and coconut milk does not work in my opinion.

I have made this dish once and I omitted the tomatoes and onions-allergic. Dish still came out well but it needed a slurry which I did not have unfortunately because the sauce was a bit loose. All -in -all, lovely dish.

I followed the other reviewer’s advice regarding cooking onions longer and adding tomato at this stage. At the end, I also let it simmer without the lid on for about twenty minutes to get it to thicken more. I added about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the sauce prior to simmering which added some good texture. The family liked it but I would suggest if you like anything close to spicy, this isn’t the dish for you but it’s very flavorful.

I made this and I thought it was awesome. Just make sure you let it simmer for at least 40 minutes if you want the curry to thicken. Other than a few tweaks of my own I thought this was really great.

I followed the instructions to this recipe. Tasted it and it didn’t taste good at all. It tasted really running and watery. Then I added some of the ingredients some people suggested, cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder, cinnamon and more garlic salt. It became tolerable but I would never make it again.

This is a great curry if you've never made curry before and find it a bit intimidating. The only thing I change is that I halve the amount of coconut milk, just because the full amount makes it extremely soupy. I find that there's plenty of liquid with just the tomato sauce, the stewed tomatoes and their juices, and half the coconut milk.

I made it as written.  I had to stop cooking as the chicken was done so the sauce did not thicken.  Don't like over cooked Chicken!
Next time I will cook sauce for a good 20 minutes and then add the chicken for a thicker sauce. I will also add a boat load of mushrooms as well.  Yes, I saved the jem.

VERY easy to make and delicious! I didn't have canned tomatoes so I ended up using a bunch of cherry tomatoes. Hubby had three servings, two with rice, and one with naan. The recipe could feed a family of 6 easily. There is only two of us, so I ended having leftovers for several days. I'll make half batch next time. Oh! Also added pototoes. So much better than going out to buy. Thanks Roma!

I've made tons of recipes from Allrecipes.com and my husband has enjoyed almost all of them -- but this particular one he absolutely raved about (made exactly as written).  He even asked me if I could give it a 6-star!    It has joined my collection of especially good recipes.

So I doubled the liquids (just the coconut milk ) and spices (the curry and salt and pepper to taste) and added potatoes, peppers and broccoli. We LOVED it. Highly recommend!

I really enjoyed this recipe. 1st time I’ve made a coconut curry at home. My husband however prefers curry from a rou in a white sauce. Will make again!  I cracked the lid as it simmered and removed it near the  end and it thickened nicely

I did make a few changes to suit my family. I only added 2 teaspoon of curry power 2 tablespoons would have been way too spicy for my household and only added 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I simmered this uncovered so the sauce would thicken up more. I served it over some rice and it was hit.  I will make this again, it is a nice change from the regular meals we have.

Curried coconut chicken - made this tonight (11/06/18) changed a few things: reduced the curry powder to 1tbsp cuz 2 is too much. used chicken legs instead of cubed boneless pieces. Used passatta  (to use up a package I had opened for another recipe). added potatoes (like 5 medium ones) cuz I have so many which I need to use them up before they go bad

This has become a monthly meal for us, its so easy and fast. I’ve also made just the sauce alone and stir fry it with shrimp and cooked noodles, delish. I’ve also done the sauce with cocktail meatballs for a party, also delish.

Spicy, sweet, and savory. 
I added fresh ginger, extra garlic, and extra curry powder.
I was out of coconut milk, so I substituted with coconut cream. This made the sauce very rich and creamy. I also used monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar and coconut oil and bacon grease instead of veg oil, so it would be keto friendly.  I served it with steamed rice and oven roasted vegetables. We garnished it with sliced almonds.
My family and I really liked it, and I will surely make again.

This recipe is a go to! It’s also nice because I have most of the ingredients already in the house. The flavors in the curry blend together very nicely and it’s a mellow flavor suitable for anyone. I typically will add some fresh broccoli florets (about 12 oz) ten minutes before it’s done simmering. The broccoli tastes good with the sauce, plus extra veggies don’t hurt. Overall, it’s one of my favorites.

We enjoyed this, but did make some modifications.  I omitted the tomato sauce completely (due to reviews) and used fresh cherry tomatoes from the garden instead.  I pureed these slightly in food processor before adding figuring this would be a happy compromise.  I still found the sauce too thin and soup-like at the end of 40 minutes cooking, even though I followed the video directions to canter/vent the pan lid.  Finally cheated and added some corn starch to thicken things up as it was time to eat.  I also found the sauce as indicated a little too bland for my liking.  It has good flavor, but I personally expect a little kick when I eat curries.  When I didn't find it, I guess I felt cheated; but suspect this is due to the blending of caribbean and asian styles...I am just used to a more asian (spicy) curry.  Solved this situation by adding some Thai sweet chili sauce to give it just a little kick.  Play with the recipe according to your own tastes.

We LOVED this!  I had to omit the tomatoes because a friend is allergic but even then, it was fabulous.  We used boneless chicken thighs & I added another can of coconut milk. I only had unsweetened and it worked just as well we thought. Also fresh basil while it simmered and some scallions too. I also included some Thai sweet chili sauce I had, it added a bit of heat and blended well with the sweet.  I'll add a veggie next time, and there will be a next time :) . Thank you for a great recipe!

So good and so simple to make.  I leave out onion and extra sugar and it's still just as delicious.  I even use precooked chicken (John Soules grilled chicken). Serve with rice and it's a meal!

Yeah, this didn't blow my socks off. It certainly was edible (I only used about 2 tsp of sugar) but I will keep searching for a better recipe. It was lacking something, I don't know, more brightness maybe. The flavor of the curry mellowed quite a bit by the next day, probably due to the coconut milk. I served with rice and homemade naan which helped. I've made vegetable curries that were far superior. Sorry.

This came out excellent. I omitted tomato sauce and added a 14.5 oz can of garlic, basil and oregano diced tomatoes (not stewed tomatoes).   I had used unsweetened coconut milk so I added a total of 6 tbsp of sugar and I used Badia Jamaican style curry powder. I threw it all in the crockpot and cooked on low 6 hours. Served over white rice.

I liked this recipe. It was the first time I've ever used curry. I reduced the amount so it wouldn't be spicy. The only reason why I rate this 4 stars is because of the amount of liquid. I would suggest straining at least 1 can of the tomatoes to reduce the juice. I've also made this recipe in the instant pot.

I followed the ingredients as listed.  The only modification I made was to cut the chicken up into even smaller pieces before cooking.  My whole family loved it.  Curry is not a customary spice for us (especially in this amount), but I wanted to try something really different than the direction I usually go, and I'm not sorry.   I will make this once a month for sure.

I followed this recipe with a few minor changes due to not having ingredients on hand and/or forgetting to add.
I didn't have an eight ounce can of tomato sauce so I substituted a 28 oz. tin of diced tomatoes(undrained) in place of the 8 oz. tin of tomato sauce and 14 oz. tin of diced tomatoes. I needed to add a little corn starch to thicken it at the end as the can of tomatoes I added increased the liquid content.  I completely forgot to add the sugar, but found it wasn't needed as it turned out delicious. This recipe quick and easy to make and was a hit with the family, it's a keeper.

This recipe is fabulous as written and certainly a keeper for me!  The only thing I'd do different is  use a smaller based pan, as I needed to add more oil to cook the curry as it spread out so thin in my huge pan .  I only had larger tins of sauce and tomatoes on hand and would have been perfect for doubling if I had another can of coconut milk on hand!

Did not care for this recipe.  It ends up being pretty bland...and too tomato-y.  Perhaps it is not like any of the curries I have ever tried.  Definitely did not hit the spot.  The search continues...

The whole family liked this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly but had more than the 2 lbs of chicken.  Like other reviews the sauce did not thicken in the time mentioned even with being partially uncovered so I added some corn starch/water.  The video mentions adding some hot peppers to spice it up which might add another good dimension to the dish.

This is an easy weeknight dinner, but don't be expecting the complex flavors typical to a good, solid curry. It's like... really fun tomato soup? I added some cayenne and cumin to liven it up a bit, and omitted one of the three tbsp of sugar.

This turned out well but I definitely recommend a few changes-after 45 minutes of simmering covered the sauce was thin and tasted very tomatoey. I added about 1 t salt, another good pinch of pepper and about 1/2 t of curry powder. Then I simmered it uncovered for another 45 minutes. The sauce thickened up nicely and it tasted wonderful.  I served it with Basmati rice and Naan and my husband ate three bowls! Next time I will use less tomato sauce and add more potatoes and veggies. Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe. Could use more vegetables so I added spinach (broccoli, bell peppers, and mushrooms would probably be good too). I also like spicy foods so next time ill add a spicy pepper or cayenne powder.

Just okay. Thought it would be more creamy and less “tomatoey”. After making it per the recipe we added more curry and garlic powder, and I’d probably add a pinch of cayenne if I ever make it again.

I didn't use tomato sauce like most say I only used stewed tomatoes and may have added more seasoning (chicken bullion) habernero pepper and curry but not a lot of adjustments to it. This recipe turned out delicious! My sister loved it.

I made this for my step sons birthday because he loves chicken curry. I added carrots celery and potatoes. I also used a golden curry paste.  I cooked the potatoes a little ahead so that they would be soft. This was yummy!

I love this and have made it quite a few times! If I have it, I use chicken I have frozen or left overs. Otherwise I follow the recipe with small additions: 1-2 tsp red curry paste, 1 tsp basil, and a small amount of extra salt. I add a cup of frozen peas and 2 smallish red potatoes, cubed, for the last 15 or 20 minutes of simmering as suggested by a reviewer. I do not peel the potatoes. Served over brown rice, it is a wonderful dinner!  Sometimes I add a tsp of chicken "Better than bouillion" at the end if it tastes too sweet. Thanks for posting! Judi D

I loved it, and changed some of it, never have cooked with coconut milk will keep it in the pantry from now on. I did cook the curry in the oil 1st, as suggested & I used avocado oil. Also included zucchini and red peppers, omitted the diced tomatoes. Served over roasted cauliflower rice.

This was very delicious.  I added a little more curry powder and some salt and pepper.  Sliced up some carrots and red bell pepper also.  The sauce took a while to simmer down and thicken.  That didn't bother me.  I thought the recipe was simple, flavorful and I'll definitely make it again!

This is an excellent curry recipe. Love it ! And it’s so versatile. I do omit the tomatoes just because I don’t think they belong and I dont like cooked tomatoes. Other than that it’s just waiting for your special touch! I add tons of things to my curry like, tiny potatoes, carrots, raisins, GREEN PEAS and pineapple bits! Topped with chopped green onions and peanuts. Serve it with naan bread on top of white rice. Ohhhhh wooooow. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this.....flavor was great and made the house smell fantastic. I had to change it up a bit.....no tomato’s or sugar...but I still enjoyed it. A good cook could probably have added a little something extra to make up for the loss tomato’s/sugar flavors but that’s not me, lol ;)

This recipe is a frequent go-to in our house, so good and easy. we actually go vegetarian most nights and do veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and peas instead of chicken and it's delicious!

Very tasty, but it has no heat at all. If you are a fan of spicy Indian food, you will need to add in some peppers for heat.

I made a few minor tweaks.  I added more curry powder and a teaspoon of red curry paste, lemon zest and juice, a dash of fish sauce, 1/4 tsp of basil, and halved the tomato sauce.  I toasted the spices in coconut oil (instead of vegetable oil) for about 10 minutes (instead of 2) before adding the onions and garlic.  That being said, the end results were amazing!  This is definitely going into my rotation!

So good and so easy. I left out the tomato sauce and added about 1/2 a red bell pepper. Next time I will likely add some kind of chili pepper to up the heat.

As I only needed ingredients for 2, I halved the quantities and it came out spot on. It would help if some of the measurements were in metric as I had to convert. Other than that, it was an easy recipe to follow and it will certainly be cooked again.

Didn't even add all the tomato sauce/tomatoes and it tasted like watery tomato milk even after adding much more curry powder. Can't even taste the coconut milk in it at all. Will not make again.

Very easy recipe to make, simple ingredients. I added frozen green peas and carrots towards the end of the simmer for some color. Tasted great. Also, I drained the canned tomatoes for less liquid.

I don’t know why this is rated so high there really was nothing amazing about it. I found the curry and coconut flavours got drowned out in all the tomato sauce and all I could really taste was tomato! It was very bland. The sauce also took FOREVER to thicken. I simmered it without a lid for over 3 hours and it was still too runny. Will not be saving this recipe.

Great recipe and easy! I would recommend adding more curry and/or not using the tomato sauce as other reviews mentioned! Still delicious! I actually used the recipe as a sauce so the thickness wasn’t an issue. I am a vegetarian so I made the recipe minus the chicken, instead I fried up some tofu, sautéed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, baby corn, and red pepper), made some brown rice and put the sauce on it! So bomb! My meat eating husband even approved!

This was very easy to make, a little time consuming but worth it!!! This makes a pretty big batch that I split up for my weekly lunch.  I would suggest cutting your chicken into small chunks vs. bigger pieces to get the flavors into every bite!!!

I'm going to rate this before it hits the plate. I kept tasting and it's awesome. I added baby carrots sliced thin, some asian veggies i had a little of and sliced some green onion as well.
Recipe is my new favorite.

I, too, found this had an overpowering "tomato soup like" taste and I couldn't  taste the coconut milk at all, so it wasn't a very authentic Asian flavour.   I added some masala and just before serving, I stirred in a few large tablespoons of sour cream then topped it with some fresh chopped cilantro to try to even out the flavour.

I've never really had Indian food so I can't comment on authenticity. I like Asian curry so I thought I'd try this. I've made it twice now and I really like it. My mom and my toddler also liked it. I made rice and veggies and kind of mixed it all up together as I served it onto my plate. Didn't make any substitutions and can't think of what to improve it. It's also very easy to make and honestly there's nothing unhealthy in it which is a plus. Clean up from it isn't too bad either. So five stars : )

Have made this more times than I can remember......
BIG hit at work.  Let that curry and oil work, simmer in the beginning, then add onion and garlic.
Only changes, used homemade curry,  coconut cream and on occasion will finish with fresh mango don't use as much coconut cream if you go with this.
As far as the liquids go......
how thick do you want it and how long are you willing to wait.

2nd time making this recipe. Discovered too late that I didn't have a can of tomato sauce, so substituted a smaller can of tomato paste. Made sauce thicker and a little more tomato-y, but not majorly different. Will definitely make this again.

Tasty recipe! It's easy to overcook the chicken though, so be careful. Also, I drained the juice from the canned diced tomato before adding it. I didn't want the curry to be too watery and have that weird canned food smell.

Very good base recipe, it needed a bit of tweaking. I followed the reviews, and cooked my curry powder in extra oil for a good 5 minutes, then added onion and some bell pepper and cooked that down, garlic, then cooked the chicken, and added the stewed tomatoes and coconut milk. I added extra curry, a tad bit of basil, parsley, and cilantro, just small amounts because it needed more flavor. Also, make sure to cut the sugar in half! With the tomatoes it is too sweet with the full amount. Served with white rice and roasted vegetables that needed to be used up.  I loved this recipe after my modifications! Tasty girls night dish. Do yourself a favor and make this, and tweak to your liking.

I love this recipe! I make it once a month and have modified slightly. Instead of canned tomatoes I use 2 large tomatoes and dice up, and omit the tomato sauce and replace with half a can of tomato paste (because that's all I had). I follow the direction except I add the raw cubed chicken in a crockpot and pour all other cooked ingredients on top and add veggies and let cook for 4 hours on high. It's so delicious over rice or cauliflower rice!

My fiancée asked me if I would make her a curry, and I found this gem. It was easy, and delicious! I was concerned with the amount of tomato product, but it was perfect and not overpowering. I could not get stewed diced tomatoes at my local supermarket, so I used regular diced. I also added a bit of oil halfway through the cooking of the chicken. The end result was nothing short of a five star review. Nice work!

I replaced the tomatoes & tomato sauce with fresh pineapple & some of the juice from the fresh pineapple (about 1/2 cup). I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1/2 teaspoonful of garlic powder, omitted the sugar, used unsweetened coconut milk & substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  I also added 2 carrots sliced in rounds and a few frozen peas as others had suggested. My husband & I enjoyed this dish and I plan to make this again.

I followed this recipe mainly as directed and oh my gosh was it good. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste mixed with equal parts chicken broth, I also added a little cayenne to balance the sweetness and a dash or two of cumin. Delicious!

Made this exactly as directed.  The chicken was way overdone, like almost inedible.  7-10 minutes before adding liquids would normally be almost enough to cook chicken breast chunks but then another 30 - 40 minutes simmered was just way too much.  And even forgetting the overcooked chicken, the curry was tasteless.  Perhaps, after reading some reviews just now, this cooking method wasn't exactly the best way to bring out the best curry. I have to agree with the tomato soup analogy because that's what I thought it looked like too.  Chicken chunks in tomato soup with curry powder.  I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't already know how to cook Indian food properly. Like me.  I threw mine out uneaten and hubby ate just enough to ward off hunger.

I've been looking for a great coconut chicken curry that didn't get overtaken by the coconut nor the tomatoes. This is the most superb recipe ever.  The hubby and I love curry so i added in about 1 tablespoon more of curry and just a splash more of the coconut milk and it was perfect.  I actually followed what Cook Stephanie advised about cooking the curry, onions and garlic for about 10 minutes to open up the flavors. I then added the chicken and let it absorb the seasonings for about 15 mins. this is a sure keeper in our home!!

thank you!!!

I made it as it states but being sure to cook the onions too translucency and chopping up the stewed tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers.  Truthfully this was pretty bland.  I would make it again but not until reading similar recipes.  My spouse thought it tasted like ketchup.  I wouldn't go so far, but I was disappointed.

I agree with other reviewers: way too sweet and ketchup-y.  I added crushed red pepper flakes and ginger to try to offset the sweet and make the sauce more interesting.  Not enough "help" in my opinion.  It was simple to prepare and my kids did eat it, so that is a plus. But, I would not make it again.

I'm an avid cook, but a newbie to making curry (but not to eating it!!!).  I made this out of the ingredients I had on hand, and my whole family was in love with it.  I used boneless skinless thighs as the protein and coconut oil as the fat.  Browned the onions, garlic and curry in coconut oil, added the coconut milk, and just one can of diced tomatoes, since I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand.  I also stirred in a can of chickpeas and some chopped spinach at the end.  No sugar needed.  Served it over coconut basmati rice.  Outstanding.  Will make this again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

This phenomenal dinner was the result of a freezer clean out.  After reading the reviews I decided to follow the advice of someone who shared a tip from her Indian mother:  make a spice paste FIRST, then get to the business of making the curry.  The result is a deep, rich flavor that makes the food restaurant quality.  I could not be more pleased.  Here's what I did: 


 I cooked the curry and oil for 5 minutes. The curry gets super dark and forms a paste. Then I put the onions and garlic in and cooked those for 10 full minutes adding just a little more oil. Then I added a can of crushed and diced tomatoes with basil. I let that cook for about 7-8 minutes. On the side I had preseasoned my chicken chunks (PLEASE season your chicken people) with garlic powder and adobo. After the tomatoes had cooked a bit I added the chicken and let it get partially cooked. Then I added the coconut milk and the sugar. I omitted the tomato paste. I let it simmer for about 50 minutes uncovered,covered it while I went to vote. Came back 20 minutes later, uncovered it and let it cook for another 15 minutes or so and then made some basmati rice and onion and cheese stuffed paratha on the side.   Salt before serving.  Excellent.  I'm going to make a vegetarian version for my husband by swapping chicken for paneer.

**I cooked mine in a dutch oven - not a skillet.  Loved the result!**

So first I made it as per instructions and it was extremely bland. I personally like spicy and full flavors and this had all of the building blocks, but not enough kick. After letting the sauce simmer a while, I tasted it and decided to add chili powder and red pepper flakes. It was still kind of bland. I also had to simmer the sauce uncovered for an additional forty minutes in order for it to thicken.

As for the chicken,  it was also bland after following the instructions to the letter. I tasted it after the chicken had cooled and was disappointed with the level of flavor so decided to throw it back in the pan with more curry powder. I had to add at least a tablespoon more.

After these adjustments, it still tasted fine, but not really good enough to make again.

This was very tasty, and not difficult.  Someone suggested letting the curry and the oil cook for about 5 minutes before adding the onion, and this is correct.  I also used unsweetened coconut milk, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some heat.  I could have used more.  I would suggest, for those eating a low carb diet, putting this over spaghetti squash instead of rice.  Great recipe!

Didn't follow recipe exactly but it was excellent!  I was worried after reading the review that said it tasted like tomato soup.  Not what I was going for.  I couldn't resist tasting it before simmering and it did tase like that!  I simmered for 2 hrs and got exactly what I wanted.  In fact, it was even better the next day!  I left out the salt and sugar, used tomato paste, not sauce.  Added a few chilis, not many. Will be making this again and again!

I always try to have the ingredients for this on hand in the pantry for nights when I don't feel like cooking, but we already ordered delivery earlier in the week. It is quick and lazy, but doesn't taste quick and lazy.

Great blend of flavors! After simmering uncovered for 45 minutes, the sauce was still pretty runny. I was in a hurry, so I thickened it up with about 3 Tbs of corn starch. Came out the perfect!

It tasted good. BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE. It tastes more like a coconut flavoured tomato sauce. if I could recommend something it would be to use an authentic Indian recipe that DOES NOT add tomato sauce or paste, and instead one diced fresh tomato

Great recipe. I added snap peas, sliced carrots, and celery, then let them simmer for the last 10 mins. And I used light coconut milk.  It was great. I will use whole coconut milk and try some of the other suggestions next time though to make it even better.

Made a couple changes and it turned out amazing!!!!!!!  Mix the curry with oil cook for a few minutes, then add onion and garlic, cook for 10 min. Then add 1 tsp cummin, 1 tsp turmeric and 1 tsp coriander. Cook for a few more min add veggies (I added sweet potato and zucchini) and chicken. I added just 1 cup of diced tomatoes and then a 1/2 cup  of coconut milk and 1 tbsp of water. I added cilantro and spinach at the last 10min. Turned out soooooo delicious !!!

Great dish. I used all ingredients. I wanted mine to be more sweet. I added a little bit more sugar. I left it uncovered. Simmered for about 55 minutes. It thickened beautifully. On a bed of rice. It was a nice balanced meal. My first time doing a dish like this, and my husband loved it. He cleaned his plate. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely be using it again and sharing it as well!

This is a very good recipe the only changes I made was to use red curry paste and local fresh tomatoes that were in season. It similar to Thai Pan dishes with the subtle flavor of the coconut. I did use the slow cooker to cook this dish.

Great recipe.  Definitely add some spice though.  I used a few dashes on red pepper flakes to give a punch.  Also, next time I make for my family, I will add potatoes.

This is my go-to curry recipe! It is important to simmer the curry paste in butter or oil for a while before you add the onion and garlic. I use coconut oil and coconut sugar and grass fed butter for the recipe. I also omit the tomato paste and add a dash of paprika, cayenne, cumin and chili powder along with some red pepper and cilantro paste. Outstanding!!

This recipe was so good. I didn't make any changes to  it and it came out delish!  Make sure to keep the lid half off the pot so your sauce can thicken up nicely. This recipe is a keeper!

Just ok. Made as is, it was much too sweet for our tastes.  I tried to add tumeric, ginger and extra curry powder but it still tasted like sweet coconut  milk with  a strange tomato  taste. I would t be making again.

This is one of our favorites! I make it at least once a month. We buy all organic ingredients to get maximum nutrition. It's great for vegans too, just leave out the chicken! Add red bell pepper and mushrooms.

Let me start by saying this was delicious. I think the name of the recipe should be changed though. It didn't taste anything like curry chicken. It tasted more like a delicious creamy tomato chicken. But like I said it was delicious. The recipe didn't specify what kind of curry powder. So I used green curry as I thought the red would be to spicy. Do me I simmered it with the lid off as some of the reviews said that there's came out liquidy. I added a little corn starch at the end to thicken it up. Next time I think I will add some vegetables like sliced carrots or mushroom like some of the reviews suggested.

Exquisite recipe. My home smells so wonderful!
I used 2 frozen Chicken breasts... Cooked them in a covered pot with oil & salted water to expedite meal. 
Removed cooked chicken & water... Heated oil, added yellow curry, then onion & garlic.  Dry, so added a little water. 
Chopped chicken, added to mix, stirred. 
Added 14.5 oz Fire Roasted Tomatoes. 
Added 13.5 oz Coconut Milk. 
Used One TBS Sugar, not 3. 
Added 1/3cup shredded Carrots. 
Added a bit of Salt & Pepper. 

Served over Uncle Bens Brown Rice.    EXCELLENT FLAVOR. 

*** next time I'll make it the same as above, but will use 18-20 oz. of  Coconut Milk.      This was Simply Excellent!

Very tasty and fairly easy to make. I used a larger can of stewed tomotoes( about 18 oz) so I didn't add the tomato sauce. I used 1T of regular curry powder and 1T of hot curry powder. Next time I'd use 2T of hot curry powder for more heat.

I made this tonight,  it was so easy but I ended up letting it simmer for a little longer (I ran out of rice and had to go buy some :/) I changed the canned tomatoe sauce to 1/3 cup of ketchup.  It was so tasty!!  I'll definitely make this again!

My whole family loved it! I added three potatoes cut small and let sit in the juice for the 40 minutes on simmer. They were perfectly cooked. I steamed broccoli on the side and diced avacodo to top it off. All the flavors were amazing!

This is a easy, if not authentic, recipe that yields a tasty coconut curry. We use a little less the 1 TBL of sugar and wonder if we could and simmer with the cover off.

Great recipe, I will make it again we did ours with thighs instead of breasts, more flavor. As always I read the reviews before starting the recipe. For one we like spicy so we added a Serrano pepper  which added a lot of heat. I suggest 1/2 for those less tolerant. Curry paste, I also only had unsweetened coconut milk which worked I just added more like 1/4 c sugar.

I have never eaten this before so have nothing in which to compare it. It had nice flavor although I found myself adding extra curry powder (maybe mine is a weak curry powder?) and a little cayenne for some heat. I still found that it seemed to be lacking... something, even though my wife disagrees. It is very easy to make and I must admit that I let it simmer over an hour uncovered as others have done, which gave a nice smooth consistency to the curry. Not sure what it would have been if covered but it seemed very loose and I wanted to ensure it thickened. Overall I am glad I tried and will be making again for sure, but may play with seasoning a bit more next time.

I made this as stated with the exception of using mild red curry paste instead of powder because that was all I had.  I would definitely make this  again in the future however I would add more seasonings.  We added spicy sriracha oil to ours  and oh my gosh! Perfect.   Also, simmer uncovered. It needs to thicken. My baby 1 yr old LOVED it (without the sriracha of course)!

Have made this twice followed exact recipe the first time and it was very good, however I did not particularly care for the tomatoes. The second time I left out the tomatoes out and substituted peas and shredded carrots. Also added 1 tablespoon of garam masala. We like spice. It was even better when tweaked to our preferences.

I was so excited to try this dish after reading such positive reviews, but it really did taste like a creamy tomato soup with chunks of chicken. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like a coconut or a curry dish- pretty disappointing! Will not be making again.

It was a big hit in our house. Next time, I'll omit the sugar, as it was a little sweet for our taste. We served it over Jasmine rice. Good stuff!

Good idea but definitely, leave out the tomato sauce and drain your tomatoes or use fresh instead.  Way too much liquid.  I also omitted the sugar.

I doubled the recipe for my large family and for leftovers. I added two cubed and pre-cooked steamed sweet potatoes and did not use the tomato sauce. I used coconut cream instead of the milk. Served with Basmati rice. I will make it again! Delicious

It was okay. I left out the tomato sauce, and the dish was really watery. I couldn't get it to thicken up, even after watching the video.

I made mostly as directed - I did let it simmer for about an hour. I added peas that I cooked separately before serving over jasmine rice. Nice mellow flavor for those in my family who don't have adventurous tastebuds - definitely a family pleaser!

It is a fast, adequate recipe with tweaking.  I followed the recipe and one thing I know about garlic is it gets bitter if its over-cooked, which it will get if you sauté with the chicken on med-high.  I left out the tomato sauce, used less sugar, sautéed a bunch a vegis before hand that I added after letting the chicken simmer for about 20 minutes.  My kids ate it so it passed THAT crucial test!

Made this for the first time and more or less followed the directions. I put in a little less sugar, drained some of the water from my diced tomatoes, and added a little cumin and paprika. With all that, it still ended up WAY too tomato-y! might try to tweek it and make it again because it's easy, but be prepared to simmer UNCOVERED for at least 50 minutes so it's not soupy.

This was delicious! I took the first reviewers advice in making the "broth" and I also reduced the sugar. So so good. I simmered it uncovered for about an hour and served it with "cauliflower rice". Yummmm.

We really loved this recipe! However the chicken was overdone by the end of the time. So I brown the chicken with the onions  first and set aside. Then add the rest of the ingredients to the pan and cook as directed. Once all done, I toss the  chicken /onions back in pan for a few min to finish cooking in the sauce. Comes out  perfectly!

We quite enjoyed this recipe.  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs since that's what I had, and light organic coconut milk.  I added carrots cut into matchsticks as per another reviewer and some fish sauce - perhaps a TBSP. I would have liked to have added fresh basil but I didn't have any so I used dried.  I used 1.5 TBSP of red curry paste that I cooked first in the oil before adding the onions.  It had only the tiniest bit of heat.  I let it simmer a touch too long.  The sauce got very thick.  It was delicious, but I wouldn't have minded a little bit more sauce.  All in all, although I wouldn't say it was particularly "authentic", it was delicious and easy. I would definitely make it again and would spice it up a notch if I didn't have kids eating it too!

Excellent collection of flavors. I discarded the juices from the diced tomatoes to allow the sauce to thicken a little more. Which made it richer in flavor.

I used twice the amount of curry.  I also did not use the sugar or tomato sauces.  I did dice up 2 whole tomatoes and used them instead.  It allowed all the other flavors to shine through.  I also added a bag of frozen carrots to it.
Incredible!  I saved it and will definitely be making it again.

Loved it!! It was a big hit with my family. I doubled the recipe.  I read the reviews before I made it and I cooked the curry in the oil for about 5 minutes before adding the onion.  I cooked the onions until they were translucent and then I added the chicken.  When the chicken was mostly cooked through- I added the garlic and sautéed that for about one minute before adding the remaining ingredients.  I also added cubed red potatoes.  I covered it and simmered for 30 minutes and then uncovered it and simmered it for another 30 minutes. I served it over basmati rice.  Yum!! This will definitely make it into my meal rotation.

One of my favourites, fairly easy to make. I usually make with egg noodles for underneath and I always omit the sugar. The first time I made this something just wasn't right, and it's been perfect every time since I've left out the sugar, in my opinion.

So good! I simmered the recipe in a Dutch oven for about an hour and a half, per some of the other reviews.  It was the perfect thickness.

I served this curry over sweet potato "noodles".  To balance the sweetness, I added a couple of healthy pinches of red pepper. Yum!  My husband gobbled it down.  I highly recommend and will be making this on a regular basis.

Very nice flavor with just enough bite.  After reading several reviews I only used 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce, and I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, turmeric, and garam masala.  Because the dish was very soupy I simmered the sauce uncovered for an hour stirring often and reducing the liquid by half.  The reduced sauce thickened just enough to give it body.  Delicious!

Fantastic!! It was perfect! To make it a tad bit healthier, I think you could probably get away with 1 TBSP sugar and have it still come out delicious. Excellent recipe!

Curried Coconut Chicken Haiku: "Not too thrilled with this. Liquid-y, tomato-y, and it's bland to boot." Followed the recipe to the letter and found that it was watery, heavy on the artificial tomato flavor, and fairly boring in the flavor department. There are better coconut curry chicken recipes on AR, and while I'm glad to have tried a new one out, it won't be a repeat for us.

It was edible, but it was more chicken and tomato than chicken coconut curry. Hardly taste the coconut and curry. Won't try this recipe again.

Not sure why but mine turned out very bland. I added a few jalapeños and extra curry to spice things up more and still slightly bland. A good recipe for those who want a mild curry.

Simple to make even for a neophyte like me, and great over rice. Just a bit "soupy", as I used all the contents of the canned tomatoes. But that was great for the rice! Will make it again.

I love curry but didn't particularly care for this recipe. Now writing this review after the second time of trying it. Decided that this will be removed from my favorites list. I think the stewed tomatoes and sauce overpowered the curry flavor.

Was too sweet.  To fix the sweetness, I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp of garam masala.  It helped balance it but it was still just oK.  Not worth the lurking curry smell.

I'm new and not really a big cook so please take everything I say with a grain of salt. 

First cooking I did the whole thing as per recipe and it turned out very good, but I personally didn't much enjoy the interplay between the tomatoes and the coconut. 

My adapted version:
- tomatoes 
+ grated fresh ginger
+ a little bit of grated lemon zest (once I used lemon pepper on the meat and it was fine but not as.. Zesty) 
I used unsweetened coconut  milk and brown sugar. I simmered the while thing on very low flame for about an hour. 
Also, although not necessary, for a nice bit of taste and colour I added some broccoli lightly sauted in butter. It absorbs aroma very nice.. Just be careful to add it later in the simmering process or it'll become soft and break apart (which doesn't affect the taste bit looks weird).

Followed the suggestion of making the "broth" and it worked out great. I used mix of peppers and onions that I had on hand, loved the addition of the peppers. Right at the end, I removed the chicken chunks, shredded them with a fork, and returned to the pan, loved the little pieces in every bite! 

I thought it was a touch too sweet, I may back off the sugar or use unsweetened milk next time. Love another reviewers suggestion of adding frozen peas.

yummy curry.
 I only used one 14oz can of peeled tomatoes (store didn't have stewed). I broke up the tomatoes and also added chunky 2 chopped  sweet potatoes; 1T of fish sauce, couple TBL chicken bullion/water and corn starch to thicken.  
love one pot dump meals.

Everyone in my house loved this recipe!  We all like rice, but really enjoy this recipe served with couscous and of course Naan bread.  I picked up some spinach as a side from the International section (Indian). I may try okra mixed in one of the next times I make this which also could act as a thickening agent since the sauce takes a while to thicken.

This is quick and tasty.  I always add more garlic than what is called for and to make it less spicy for my kids I add only one tablespoon of curry and balance it out with a mix of ground cumin, coriander  and turmeric.  I also subtitle the sugar for two tablespoons of coconut nectar to keep it low glycemic.

This recipe was wonderful! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that is what I happened to have thawed. I used yellow sweet curry powder, Garam Masala, and Penzey's Curry "The Now Curry".  I also used petite diced tomatoes, again...it was only because it was what I had.

So good!

This is a great dish.
I made a few changes, I omitted the tomato sauce and sugar, added a larger can of diced tomatoes (28oz), and added two large diced sweet bell peppers (at the same time as the coconut milk and diced tomatoes).
We coupled it with basmati rice and naan bread.
Yum Yum!
We will be making this again.

I was hoping for Thai flavors, but this was definitely an Indian curry. It was tasty, but a little too tomato-y. I'd cut back on the tomato sauce.

My apartment smelled very strongly of curry for almost a week afterwards, so beware!

Made as written except with extra curry. Extra seasoning didn't help because it was still overpowered by the tomatoes and lacked body. If I make it again, I would use fresh tomatoes and omit the tomato sauce.

this worked out great. Although I did change the following:
note: I like spicy
I used coconut oil instead of veg oil
I added to the hot oil the onions as directed but a whole one
I added Turmeric and the curry (equal parts, but at least double what the recipe called for
I added added a chile pepper cut up
I added the chicken as instructed 
After I added the coconut milk, unsweetened , and only half a can of tomato paste. (no sauce)
I added some mushroom
I also added cinnamon, a healthy sprinkle 
I am not a big salt fan so I left that to the end and added it to my taste
As I did not have sugar a added a little honey
I let it simmer for about 35 to 40 mins

It came out wonderful !!!!

Double the onion (1 whole onion instead of half). Added an extra half tbs of curry. Remember to salt and pepper the chicken before cooking! Needs a richer flavour though... maybe a beef bouillon cube?

I used Sweet Yellow Curry Powder by The Spice House which gave  it a wonderful flavor.  I substituted a can of  petite diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes.  Just before serving, I thickened the sauce with about a tablespoon of cornstarch.

THE key issue with this recipe is the tomato sauce quantity PLEASE notice that it does say 1 can of tomato sauce, BUT it is an 8OZ can, not a 14.5, this makes a huge difference!!

Love love love this recipe. I made a few tweaks and it was ssssooooo good. Instead f using curry powder I used curry paste and I put 3 tablespoons of it also I only put a teaspoon of salt and instead of regular canned tomatoes I put fire roasted tomatoes but I drain the water and one can chickpeas  i had no problems with the stew getting thick. I will definitely make this again maybe with beef or shrimp mmmmm

This recipe was easy to follow.  I cooked the chicken in the oil, with the onions and garlic and 1 teaspoon of plain curry powder. 
Once cooked took the chicken out of the skillet and set them aside. I then made the sauce in the same pan i cooked the chicken in added the salt, pepper, curry powder, 3 table spoons of brown sugar 1 can of diced tomatoes - not drained, 1 can of coconut milk lite, and i also added 3/4 cup of sour cream, and added 3 more teaspoons of brown sugar ( I like curry mild and sweet) Ialso used chicken broth with a little flour to thicken it up and then added the chicken back in added small red potatoes at the very end and let simmer on low for 30 minutes.  it came out great!!

The recipe was great.  I changed it up a bit by putting 2 cans of chickpeas and about a cup and a half of green peas in it. The only thing i would do different next time is put a little bit less sugar or maybe using pineapple instead of sugar

Takes more time than expected to prep, because cutting up the chicken and extracting the icky parts takes a while for me. But massively popular with my husband. I added some peppers to the mix for funsies.

First off, the first step didn't make sense. The curry and oil started burning and I followed the directions to a tee. Then when we ate it, it was spicy and caused all three of us to have digestive upsets.

I used left over chicken and added a chicken cube.  Also used my favorite pasta instead of rice.  Yum!

Tomato sauce was too over powering and the sugar made it way too sweet.

I thought this was pretty simple. I read other reviews about too much tomato and instead swapped out all the tomato and sauce for 1 super large fresh with juice. Worked great.

I've made this recipe a few times now. I love it, and its easy to prepare, though it does take some time simmering down to get it nice and thick. I found that the cooking time of 30-40 minutes was not long enough, I give mine closer to an hour to make a rich sauce.

Really easy to make, hubby loved it. I added mango chutney for sweetness as pouring white sugar in to a curry felt wrong. I also added some spinach leaves in at the end for a healthy addition. Really tasty and I will make again.

One of the best recipes ever!!!  I make this regularly and follow Cook Stephanie's recommendation of slow cook the curry in the oil before adding onion, etc.  ALSO VERY IMPT!!!  You need to cook this outside on your grill burner or in an electric pan as your house will smell of curry for weeks!!  Also serve this with basmati rice by replacing a portion of the water with coconut milk and a little salt -- OMG to die for!!  Finally serve with NAAN bread as you will want to soak up the curry sauce.  Again, this is the most delicious recipe ever!!

Really enjoyed - I would cut down a bit on the sugar. I substituted some home made tomato sauce (simple tomato and garlic sauce) instead of paste and canned tomatoes.

I never made curry anything before but I love curry so I tried this recipe. It is very good recipe but I don't think it really tastes all that much like curry. Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of tomato sauce and maybe a smaller can of diced tomatoes.

This is amazing.  I added another teaspoon of curry because we like it spicier, just personal preference.  It was delicious and easy to make.

I made this recipe and will definitely make again.  Based on some of the other reviews I did make some modifications.   
1.  I used a red curry paste instead of powder and cooked it in oil for 5 minutes before adding the onion and garlic. 
2.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned as that was what I had in my house.  I also substituted the tomato sauce for some tomato paste.   
3. I only used 1tblspn of sugar.  

Overall we really liked it.  I may modify it a bit more next time to include some potatoes and vegetables..

I've made this twice turned out amazing both times. This last time I chose to let it simmer a little longer to allow it to thicken more. Made two variations, with chicken and with tofu for my dinner party. I would say it was quite a success as both the vegetarians and us meat eaters were equally pleased. Served with white rice, salad, and naan. Had a great meal.

I really like this recipe and I tend to use recipes as guidelines. I used Roma tomatoes about eight of them I peeled and seeded them  and added them after the chicken.  It was only for three people so I did one large chicken breast that was about a little bit over a pound.   Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil and a little butter.  I used three  cloves of garlic.  I used one whole the vidalia onion.  I par boiled potatoes to get the skin off, cubed them,  sautéed them in butter and edit them when I added the coconut milk unsweetened.  I did a mix of four different curry powders.  A dollop of curry paste hot.  2 tablespoons of sugar instead of three.  And I added about 3 to 4 ounces of raw fresh spinach.

Made this tonight and it was awesome, definitely going to be a regular.  I did tweak it a little however, I used red curry paste, I also added 1 tblspn of crushed ginger & I drained the canned tomatoes.  Served it over jasmine rice with a nice green salad and that's it.  This is so easy to prepare, only 7 or 8 ingredients and your flying!   Highly recommend this!

I Wasn't too happy with this recipe. It was too thin and didn't have enough favor and I even added more curry powder. I'll stick with the wet curry,I'm not a fan of the powder from the start anyhow. Maybe I'm just not good at making curry chicken using the powder, this was just an experiment anyhow just to see if it would be better then the wet curry.

Love it! I followed the recipe and had plenty of sauce. I did not drain the tomatoes, so it was really soupy. I left it uncovered to simmer, and it was just the right consistency.

I was so excited about this recipe. I read the reviews, watched the video, and followed the recipe exactly. The review about this tasting like tomato soup, I thought, must be from someone who made her own changes. I hate to say that she was spot-on. I am so bummed after the amazing smell and beautiful look of this dish, it was underwhelming taste-wise. The sweetness was akin to sloppy joe's. The sugar didn't accentuate the coconut milk, as the author indicated, but drowned out the flavor completely. I hope to try it again as a base recipe because I think it has great potential, but I will not be following the recipe to a "t" again. So bummed this didn't work out!

If you've never made curry and want to try, this recipe is for you. I did make a couple of small changes to make this recipe truly exceptional for my household. Firstly, I used about 1.5lb of chicken breast tenderloins because that's what I had on hand. It ended up being plenty! If you truly want a curry flavor, increase the amount of curry (and subsequently oil). I probably added an additional tablespoon of curry and a dash more oil to handle it. Honestly, more could have been added for our taste but it was still great. Let the curry and oil cook (and especially the onions) longer than directed. Really cook down the onions.  I substituted the sugar for dark brown sugar, which deepens the flavor and brings out the other flavors. If you do this, you'll have to increase the proportions to maintain sweetness. I did this to taste. Simmering time MUST be extended to reach a good consistency. I let simmer with top on for about 30 minutes and uncovered for another 30, then let sit for 5 minutes. Served with Jasmine rice and my girlfriend was begging for more. A recipe with incredible potential for a great, easy homemade curry.

This was a big hit with my family. As suggested by other reviews, I also added fish sauce before simmering. I tossed carrots and cauliflower in olive oil and garlic and roasted for 25 minutes while I was chopping the onions and chicken, then threw them in at the last minute and served all over brown rice. I accidentally forgot to add the sugar and nobody missed it. We'll be making this again!

This recipe, when followed, produced a bland product that tasted more like a watered down tomato soup than a curry. I added two tablespoons of garam masala and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it still seemed to lack an essential flavor component. I would highly suggest eliminating the tomato sauce and instead cooking it with fresh tomatoes, half the amount of coconut milk called for, and some additional ginger. Perhaps a squeeze of lemon would add a needed acidic component as well. This was a tragic letdown that I'll never cook again.

Good base recipe. Also added extra spices, garlic, tumeric, red pepper flakes, cayenne, white pepper, generous salt, and extra curry. Drain your diced tomatoes. Takes about a half hour over medium to thicken. Very easy.

awesome recipe! I used curry paste instead of powder and added an extra tablespoon. I like heat so I added a good amount of cayenne pepper and ground red pepper. very good over some rice!

I will make again.  Repeated compliments from husband and 23 year old son.  Used advice from Stephanie's review on 6/11/2007 regarding the cooking of the curry and the onions.  Also, used lite coconut milk.  I did low simmer uncovered for about 50 minutes.  Easy!  Only change would be that I would double the recipe so there would be leftovers.  YUM!!!

Terrific. I used pasta sauce in place of the paste/sauce and most of the sugar. Worked well. Also did add some peas, diced potato and diced carrot. Let it simmer until it gets to the consistency you want. Great over brown rice.

This was pretty good! Overall impression: it was too tomatoey for me, but mixing in sweet corn in my bowl cancelled some of this out. 50 mins on medium heat uncovered thickened the sauce using all liguids listed. I added in a little extra curry powder, and a smidge of crushed red pepper. I think next time I'll ditch the tomato sauce, or maybe not use quite so much, maybe do some research on other spices to add to this.

Really easy but too mild for me.  I added some white white, twice as much curry, more red pepper flakes a sweet green pepper and a dollop of greek yogurt when I serve.  Oh,  and no sugar.  I give my version 5 stars...but couldn't have done it with out you!

This was a great hit although I did make a few changes. Be sure to cook your curry powder in the oil for approx 5-10 minutes before adding the onion. You can always add a little extra oil if needed. I eliminated the sugar, used 3 cloves garlic instead of two and used 2-3 tbsp tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. 

I served it over rice which is what my daughter and I like and it was wonderful and very easy.

So good!! 

I had to change a few things due to my lack of ingredients/differing ingredients. One of my changes was *spicy* so I had to balance it with extra milk and added vinegar: 

22.5 oz Fresh tomatoes proccessed in blender
2 Tbsp Hot curry powder
4 cups coconut milk
3 Tbsp rice vinegar

I look forward to making it another time with the proper ingredients and not having to account for the overwhelming spice I chose. That hot curry powder is fabulous as a sprinkle on roasted eggplant slices or in chicken broth, but it is too much as Tbsps in a recipe.

This was delicious.  I used garlic and ginger paste and I let it cook for 2 hours.  The chicken was so moist even after the long cooking. I'm making this again tonight because it was so well liked by my family.

So I made this for the first time tonight...it was good but I will definitely make a couple of changes next time. One is I will cut the amount of sugar by half, it was too sweet. I will also simmer uncovered to be sure the sauce thickens enough which I actually did tonight after reading some reviews. I may use the tomato juice that came with the tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce next time instead of discarding it. Other then that we liked this recipe and will make it again.

Added about 1 tbs garam masala, and chopped zucchini. Wouldn't hesitate to add peas or other greens.
Toasted curry powder and garam masala for a couple minutes in pan before adding oil.

This turned out great. The only mistake I made was using a pot that was too small, thinking that my pot could contain all the ingredients. This is an awesome recipe. The only thing I did differently was drain the diced tomatoes before adding them to the curry. Will definitely be making this again. Also a tip to anyone who is making this: You and your house will smell like curry while making this, and afterwards. The smell lasts at least 24 hours, so take note of that.

Made this as indicated only adding 8 oz of Mushrooms, served over basmati rice. Easy to make, wife says I can make it again. Did have to do a hard simmer for an hour. Taste and spice level was good.

No decent Indian cook would use curry powder. That's an English thing. That being said this is a delicious recipe that came out perfect. Yes it "tastes" very similar to real Indian cuisine and will make it again. Where do I get my curry powder? I use only "Sharwood's Hot Curry Powder" imported from.....England. The substitutions I made were to use chicken thighs for more flavor, refined coconut oil to fry the chicken in, and coconut/palm sugar which has a lower glycemic index than refined white sugar.

I made this recipe and it was delicious!!  The coconut milk gave such great flavor.  I omitted tomato sauce and just added one can of diced tomatoes. I added a little more curry than what the recipe called for.  I also cooked the chicken separately.  I couldn't stop eating it.

This is a nice and filling dish. Reading previous reviews I cut down on the liquid - instead of using a can of tomato sauce I used tomato paste. And I simmered with the lid off for a while to let it thicken a bit more. I was looking for more coconut and curry flavours, but it's still tasty and second helpings were had. I served it with caulirice.

Yummy! I didn't add the can of tomato sauce but I added sweet potato (about the same time as I added the chicken). I added peeled eggplant near the end & finished it with cilantro, mint and sweet Thai basil. Definitely a keeper

This is incredibly easy to make yet tastes *fantastic*. It's easily as good if not better tasting than most curry I'd get at a restaurant. I was skeptical at first, after reading a review mentioning that the whole thing just tasted like tomato sauce -- it wasn't the case at all.

This is my first time making a curry dish like this. I read the reviews and in the gravy put 7 T curry. I think I over cooked it though because it was a little bitter. I will definitely make this again but not cook the curry as long before adding the onion. 
Also, I simmered it about 50 minutes uncovered and it thickened up perfectly.

We make this recipe at least once per week and love it! The ONLY thing we add is the appropriate chili pepper to make the amount of spice we re in the mood for.

I've now made this dish about six times, and we love it. It is so easy! I make it as directed, and I incorporate the hint from the first reviewer who said to warm the curry for five minutes and then cook with the onion for ten more. I pair it with rice and naan. I pick up the precooked chicken breast, frozen naan, and frozen rice from the warehouse store and pair it with a salad, veggies or fruit. Yum!

May have cooked off the curry powder a little to much, new cooker I think the oil was to hot. That being said was a good  dish. Next time I won't burn the curry and it will be a great dish.

This recipe is wonderful!  I added extra spices, freshly ground cardamom, green Indian peppercorns and fenugeek.  More cayenne is needed for our level of spicy.  I added some potatoes the second time I made it and they added more heartiness.

It took longer to thicken up than the recipe said. After about an hour I took the lid off and simmered for another half hour and it was great.

I made this as written with all the liquids from the cans, and I thought it came out perfectly. I served this with rice and it absorbed any extra liquid and flavored the rice. This was the easiest and best curry I have made so far.

I have made several types of curry over the years but it was always missing something. Cooking the curry paste (I used instead of powder) in the oil did the trick! This recipe is great and thickens up nicely as long as you let it simmer for the directed time. So good!

Didn't like the sweetness of the sauce. Easy to make and ingredients on hand, but it won't be a repeater for us.

Turned out great!  I had to improvise some. I substituted fire roasted tomatoes for the tomatoes and pizza sauce for the tomato sauce. I would definitely make it again. Thumbs up from my family too!

Make sure you only brown the chicken briefly in step 2, as it will cook a long while  as the dish simmers. Also, make certain to cook the curry about five minutes (medium heat) alone before adding the onion and other spices, which will need to be cooked about another 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients.. I've made it with 1 T sugar and no sugar at all: use the 1 T sugar! Drain the diced tomatoes, or be prepared to simmer it much longer. Either way works, and this is an incredible meal to serve. People will think you've really fussed!

This was just okay for us. Needed more of a kick, and I even used green curry paste rather than the curry powder. I did cut the sugar back to 1 tbls, and it was still pretty sweet. Not something I'd make again.

I thought this was an easy, excellent recipe for Coconut Curry Chicken, and I will definitely make it again. I did have to simmer for 1 hour with no cover for the sauce to thicken. We don't use rice so I served it over cauliflower that I shred in the food processor and fry it in a frying pan for 10 min over high heat.  I agree with the reviewer that said your house will smell like curry still the next day.

This is very runny.  I wouldn't add the tomato sauce, just stick to the can of tomatoes.  It tasted Okay.  The next time I make this I'll use less sauce and see if it is thicker.

Delicious! I halved the chicken and tomato sauce, doubled the onion, added green bell pepper, and omitted the sugar. I also added about a tablespoon of garam masala about halfway through the simmering time on a whim. Simmered uncovered for about 40 minutes and the sauce was still somewhat thin - this is definitely an all afternoon event. Would absolutely make this again!

It makes an abundant sauce that's so smooth! I'd like to use a hot curry powder to kick the heat up a notch next time. Made with basmatti rice and steamed baby kale with leeks n garlic. Delish with a nice mango chutney on the side,  too!

This is a really easy recipe and it was my first time making curried coconut chicken. The sauce wasn't too thin at all, in fact it turned out a bit thicker than what you are traditionally served. I added a good amount of extra curry, used a whole onion instead of half, and added a red bell pepper and 4-5 serrano peppers because I like my food spicier. I sauteed the peppers separately before throwing them into the sauce because I almost forgot about them, but they were very good in it. Simmered uncovered. I was extra careful to make sure my coconut milk was not unsweeted as well and then I served it all over rice and we enjoyed the leftovers just as much as the first day. This is definitely going to be a repeat recipe for me.

Delicious! It was very easy and my husband loved it! I followed the suggestion in the reviews to cook the curry powder in the oil for five minutes and then cook the onions until translucent. I added the garlic toward the end of cooking the onions so it wouldn't burn. Other than that I followed the recipe almost exactly except for 2 tablespoons instead of 3 of sugar, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and then I simmered for ~2 hours. Next time I think I may add a little red pepper for extra zing, but it is great just how it is!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful, but I listened to my gut feeling and I tweaked it a little bit:

First of all, cook the onions in the curry and oil until the onions are clear. This really does make all the difference. It will take a little bit longer but the taste is so worth it. I also add red and yellow peppers to this mix, and I roasted them before adding any chicken. Added so much flavor!

Also I added bay leaves, substituted garlic salt for regular salt, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes for that perfect kick. The recipe lacks some bite, so make sure you have either come cayenne, red pepper flakes, or yellow/green curry handy to combat the smoothness. 

If you can manage it, substitute organic tomato soup (I used a Trader Joe store brand) and it gave it a nice texture.

Also I added pineapple chunks and eggplants for some vegetable variety. It also helps to do this too if you are running low on chicken. Overall, it goes perfectly with naan bread or rice (I recommend jasmine, if you can afford it :D)

10/10, plus now my house smells boooooommmmbbbb

It was a bit sweet for my taste.  Next time, I will start with one tablespoon sugar, and add more to taste.

I think it needed more coconut milk, the coconut did not stand out as it should. Quick and easy to make.

I will definitely make again it was really good but after reading some reviews I did make some changes... I only used about a quarter of a can tomato sauce and half can of the tomatoes I also added quartered red potatoes and definitely didn't all the sugar not sure how much i did end up using because I tasted after each addition and adjusted

I didn't seem to get the same results as the people who have loved it. I followed the recipe precisely and discovered that after letting things simmer for 30 minutes there was still a lot of fluid, more of a soup than  curry. I then removed the cover for more than 60 minutes and it was still soup. I ended up not enjoying the flavor at all, it was reminiscent of tomato soup with a light flavor of curry. I might start with the first portion of the recipe before the coconut milk and tomato products where added, that smelled and tasted great!

After I added the sugar, I thought the dish was too sweet. But after its simmered for 30 minutes it tasted wonderful. I also missed out on spiciness, so like another reviewer suggested, I added red pepper flakes.

I love leftovers, so I doubled everything except for the chicken, but added two peeled/chopped potatoes. Reading the reviews, I also lengthened the amount of time the curry/oil heated to 5 minutes, and the onion/garlic in oil another 5. It came out great and I will make it again!

Fantastic dish! I followed the instructions exactly with the exception of adding the canned tomatoes (the sauce added enough tomato flavor for my taste and I'm not a fan of eating tomatoes). The sauce was very thin for a good 20-30 minutes, but thickened up quickly after about 45min. Tasted amazing!

It came out a little sweeter than I expected. I added extra curry and salt and simmered for about an hour instead of 40 min. I prefer thicker sauce. It came out really well, may have to add a little spice though.

I usually make chicken curry with pre-made sauce, but I finally got the courage to try it from scratch. My whole family LOVED it! My husband never gets excited about food but he kept raving about how good this was. The used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and my husband is not a fan of tomatoes so I ran the stewed tomatoes through my magic bullet before adding to the pan. I simmered the chicken in the sauce for a little extra time and it turned out so tender! This will definitely be part of our regular meal plan.

Best recipe ever! I used curry paste instead of the curry powder. Perfect balance of spice. Was nervous to serve to a family that grew up with curry, but this recipe did not fail me . And I have had people ask me for the recipe it's that good.

SO GOOD! Super easy to put together, though it does take a while to cook. I simmered it for about an hour & it was perfect. I threw in some potatoes at the beginning as well as a few sticks of lemongrass. I pounded my chicken out as well so there would be thinner pieces in the curry. The only change I'll make next time is putting half the amount of sugar into it. As is, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but just a touch sweeter than my preference.

Based on other reviews I made some modifications - but I'm convinced this recipe is fool-proof.  I omitted the tomato sauce, and added a couple of diced potatoes and carrots, and threw in some frozen peas toward the end.  I only added two heaping tsp of curry because my husband isn't a big curry fan - but I also threw in some chili pepper flakes to ensure there was some zing.  We both totally LOVED it.  Will definitely be making this again :)

Pretty simple recipe. I did drain the tomatoes with a fork however, it would have been too much tomato. I will next time add a bit more curry, I do like the curry taste and this recipe is so smooth and sweet. I used tofu instead, but I can't wait to try it again but with chicken.

It didn't "wow" me, but it was a good and easy meal that was a little different than most things I would usually cook. 

I halved the recipe for myself, so I had dinner and a few more meals for for the next few days, and served it with white rice. I enjoyed the stewed tomatoes in it!

Excellent - the second time I made these adjustments:  Added 2 T Cumin for some "heat,"  added 1 large onion, 2 peppers, some grape tomatoes.  Left out canned tomatoes and sugar.  Easy and good!

Fantastic!  Definitely in my top ten!  Changes I made was to add more curry powder and I used frozen chunk chicken that I added directly from the freezer once the sauce was built.

The sauce will be runny, however I just simmered for 45 minutes and it was perfect. Made the chicken fork tender and it gave enough time for all the flavors to mingle.  Super easy and flavorful; don't skip this one!

I made an enormous amount of changes to this recipe but the results were restaurant-quality!!! Perfectly thick, creamy, Indian dish that you could fool anyone into thinking was made by a professional chef. My recipe:

1. I used 10 frozen chicken breasts - semi-defrosted in microwave, cut into chunks, steam-cooked in canola oil until browned, then drained. It is essential to pre-cook your chicken and drain off the chicken-juice liquid so you don't end up with a runny final product. 
2. As suggested by another reviewer, I made a curry-base or "broth" by simmering 1/2-cup olive oil with 4 tbsp of curry powder over med-high for 5-minutes. Then I added 2 (smaller) chopped sweet onions and simmering this for an additional 10-minutes (until onions are semi-translucent), then adding 2 packed tbsp of fresh minced garlic and simmering together for an additional 1 minute. 
3. Add this curry-onion-garlic-oil mixture to the chicken in a large wok or pot. 
3. Add 2 (28 oz) cans of semi-drained diced tomatoes (drain approx 90% of the liquid out of the cans). 
4. Add 1 (400ml) can of coconut milk. 
5. Add 1 (160ml) can of tomato paste. 
6. Add 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1 tsp of salt. 
7. Bring this to a boil for a couple minutes, then reduce heat to a simmer. Allow to simmer over low heat for 30+ minutes while you make the rice to serve it with. 

AH-MAZING!!! The result is SOOOOOO good. I assure you, you will not be disappointed! Serve with basmati rice & naan bread.

In all honesty, I wasn't too happy with this dish. I followed everything except I added tomato paste instead. That could possibly be the reason why? I'm not much of a chef but I feel like the recipe asked for too much tomato ingredients. I literally pick up my phone while making this and started asking around how I can change the weird tangy flavor. I ended up adding more curry, kale, some broth, ginger powder,  more coconut milk, and corn starch to thicken the sauce. 

I thought it tasted good after I added my own ingredients; however, it was NOTHING like a curry dish. I had my husband try it and he literally spit it out! haha! Don't think I'll follow this recipe again.

This is like the best Chicken Korma that you have ever had!  Use full fat coconut milk and add exactly one medium thai chilli if you like a medium heat level.

It needed more curry and it was too sweet. The next time I made it, I added another TBS of curry and only 1 TBS brown sugar. That was much better. The next time it was made, I added a whole onion (diced) making sure it caramelized, three med potatoes (cubed), and a tbs Garam Masala. All of the spices were added with the browned onion, chicken and potatoes and cooked a few minutes before adding the tomato, coconut milk and sauce. Excellent.

My sauce was thinner  than I would prefer so I didn't give 5 stars but the flavor was delicious. I may add more curry powder next time and let it simmer longer. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was excellent.  I did use fire roasted diced tomatoes to give it a little more roasted flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Came out perfect.

It was too sweet. I'm not ready to say eliminate all of the sugar, but definitely cut it back a full T. And I used unsweetened coconut milk. 

I cooked it uncovered (only because I was too lazy to pull the stool over to grab the lid off of the top of the pot rack) and it turned out great and was ready in 40-45 minutes. I served it over basmati rice with roasted broccoli/cauliflower. I wish I'd made some naan. :-)

I made this according to the recipe (which I don't usually do), except for using a combination of coconut and canola oil to fry the chicken and had to use more than what was called for.  This was perfect and so easy.  Even my elderly mom, who's getting picky as she ages, really liked it.  Excellent recipe!

I had two frozen boneless chicken breasts which I put in a pan with butter on medium high heat covered for 20 mins., removed them; cooked up chopped onion in same pan over medium heat until softened, added 4 cloves chopped garlic, then 2 tablespoons curry powder,(add a little more butter or vegetable oil if needed)  cooked another 5 mins. then added the other ingredients.   I like veggies, so I added 2 carrots, 3 celery sticks and I would've added a potato but didn't have any on hand.  I forgot to add tomato sauce, but it was fine, might add that next time or maybe 1 tablespoon tomato paste if I want to thicken the sauce.   Love this, thank you and going  to do it regularly, YUM!

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I usually serve it over jasmine rice with sugar snap peas. I make so often I no longer have to write down ingredients on my shopping list and rarely check the recipe when making it. For a single person on a budget this is a great recipe for great meal without going out.

OMG! 
I had lots of sauce left over because I used 1/2 the recipe but, all the sauce. I had served it with rice. So....I combined the leftover rice and sauce and froze it.  
Tonight I took the leftover sauce and heated it. 
I sauteed some shrimp and chicken pieces in coconut oil. 
Also sauteed some broccoli and asparagus spears. 
Combined the sauteed veggies and chix and shrimp, and put it all into the leftover sauce that was simmering.
 Let it all simmer together for about 15 minutes. Was akin to an Indian sort of jumbalaya. 
YUM! Must keep this sauce on hand in the freezer for quick  delish meals. :)

Yum! We love to order Indian food from up the road, but I may just start making my own! This turned out really well! My husband was skeptical at first, but the two of us ended up polishing off the whole dish! I followed the recipe as written...added a little time in step one with the oil and curry powder is about it. Definitely will make this again!

So easy to make and soooo yummy!! It does take a very long time to simmer down but the second time I left the lid off and turned the heat up a bit and it only took a little over and hour. still very worth the wait. I also decided to add some steamed cauliflower with about 10 minutes left and it was a great addition.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times it is so easy and basically fool proof. I usually omit the diced or stew tomatoes for an extra can of tomato sauce because my kids don't like the chunkiness of tomatoes. Make sure you have good curry on hand and poured over whatever your heart desires!

Very simple recipe and turned out great.  I used two types of curry powder - mild and Thai hot, and mixed them half and half so it had more fire to it.  We also cut the sugar down to 1/3 and used Rotel tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes and added 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms.  This is great served over rice - my teenager loves it!

What different flavours from what we usually eat! I was expecting spicy because the only homemade Indian meal I've ever had was, from one of my neighbours, but this was sweet! Sweet coconut tomato curry chicken! Very yummy will definitely make this recipe for a change once in a while. Thanks :)

After reading the other reviews, I decided to double the curry.  I also used split breasts (1.25 lbs). But other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  For the coconut milk, I used Goya.  It came out terrific.  Great flavor, creamy.  I left it simmering for about an hour.  Next time, I'll try making the coconut milk from scratch.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this scrumptious meal and it was an absolute hit. I read some of the reviews before I started and as suggested, cooked the curry powder on its own first and added a few whole cardamoms.. The food was great. Full of lovely flavors and aroma. The leftovers tasted even better next day. Definitely making this my official curry home meal.

This dish was perfect. I had it with buttered mashed potatoes, while my boyfriend ate it with white rice. Both ways were delicious! This recipe had a perfect blend of spice and sweetness. Next time, I may cut down on the sugar added. Delicious! I will DEFINATELY be making this again!

Nice flavour, found it very runny though, I even simmered it for over an hour to try and thicken it, maybe cut down on the portion of tomato sauce as I felt it took away from the flavour of curry and coconut.

I love this!! I've made it numerous times with one change. I add a bunch of veggies to it: squashes, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, snap peas are all my standards...with some others added in as they're available. Very yummy and not spicy, which is a huge plus for me and my home health client who loves it as well

Yum! This was my first try at a curry dish. I had to substitute honey for sugar because of our diet, other than that followed recipe!  Followed advice of previous users to sauté curry and oil closer to 10 mins. Threw in crockpot for a few hours on low after it started to boil. It is true our house has smelled like curry for 3 days! (Including me) but it was totally worth it!

I also cooked the curry "broth" longer, then added sliced mushrooms cooking them down before adding the chicken and proceeding as directed. I slow cooked it as well.

As is, this recipe is good for people who never made curry.  It was the first recipe I did and I still use it as a base.  I've made it about... 6 times now and what I do differently is leave out the tomato sauce and sugar, we like things spicy and find the milk sweet enough.  We use a chicken curry paste that we find in the oriental section of our grocery store and with that I find I dont' need to use a lot of other seasonings though I do use salt and pepper.  I also cook the chicken in the curry sauce, this allows the chicken to really soak up the flavor.  In other words I do the sauce first and then put in the chicken to boil in.

This was an excellent recipe, that I tweaked based on my somewhat extensive knowledge of curry making.
As a fellow reviewer mentioned, you need to prepare the base of the curry well to get the best and most authentic flavours.
I started by sautéing the onions in the oil until lightly golden brown, I then added my curry powder and garlic and cooked those for another 3-5mins, followed by fresh peeled and diced tomatoes. Let those cook down for another 5mins. If at any point, you are worried about the curry burning, just add a splash of water. I then added my seasoned chicken and cooked until there was a little colour on it. Then I added the coconut milk and sugar(shouldn't have added the sugar as milk was already sweet enough). I also added green beans chopped to 1inch sizes, followed by a little cayenne and paprika.
To thicken the curry without losing volume, I added 2tblsp of ground peanuts and 2tblsp of ground cashews. This really added a little something else that we all really enjoyed.
I served with plain boiled basmati rice.
We all really enjoyed it, even my curry-snob dad ate it. Great recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was good.  Not exceptional.  Not tell-everyone-about-it.  Just good.  Some people talked about it ketchup-y, and I noticed the sauce had a very distinct ketchup taste when I first poured all the sauce ingredients into the pan.  But after the sauce cooked down for about 45 minutes, it definitely lost that ketchup flavor.   It wasn't spicy at. all. So if you enjoy having extra spice in your life, make sure to add more curry powder.

Use fresh tomatoes. Not too much otherwise it takes over the flavor.  Use a lot of curry. Heat curry in oil first.  Makes sure to cook onions until done. 10 minuets.

Super good!  I added some cubed potatoes and sweet potatoes and a bag of frozen mixed peppers .  I followed some other reviewers and used curry paste and added some fish sauce for flavor.  Served over rice vermicelli and it was a hit with my 4 and 6 year olds and my hubby.

I omit the sugar (coconut is sweet enough) and up the curry for more oomph. I also add some flour before putting the tomatoes and coconut to make a thicker sauce. serve over rice and this is a fav in my house. even my 10 year old gets excited when this is for dinner. 

once accidentally used coconut cream instead of milk and my husband still asks for it to be made that way. coconut milk still is good, but the cream is wonderful but costs twice as much.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it for my whole family, and even my dad, who is really picky, loved it. 

Although, I did misread the recipe and bought coconut cream. So I added half the amount of cream where the recipe called for coconut milk and it turned out very well. I see a lot of people were having trouble simmering it down to the right consistency. I did have to simmer mine for twice as long as the recipe calls for, and I turned up the heat so that it was a very fast simmer (verging on a low boil). I think using the thicker cream instead of the milk definitely helped as well, by having less liquid to cook off.

This was a really good dish.  I used 1.5TBSP of curry powder instead of 2 thinking it might be too strong for the kids.  I was wrong.  I'd make it next time with the full 2.  The only other thing I did differently was add a cornstarch at the end to thicken it a bit.  The whole family enjoyed it and the picky one with little complaint... so win!

I cooked this today in my pressure cooker which I feel made it not as thick as I would have liked. I realize cooking on the stove allows liquid to evaporate, unlike the pressure cooker. I omitted the sugar, and added ginger, garam masala, and cayenne pepper and felt that it could use even more flavor. I'll use this recipe as a staring point next time, but will reduce the tomato, and maybe add more onion. I will add that the 10 year old ate it up fast! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love this recipe! I've followed it exactly, and I've tweaked the ingredients to what's on hand. I do add extra curry powder, and an extra shake of red pepper flakes to up the heat factor a bit. We eat it over rice, with hot steamed vegetables. Leftovers freeze well, too, for future hot lunches.

I'll never use a jarred simmer sauce again! This was so good. My husband thought I bought a really delicious sauce and was shocked to learn I made it. I liked that is was not complicated to make. Ate it with naan and rice. I threw in some frozen broccoli for some veggies. Will make again and again. It did smell up the house for a day or two though!

This is a wonderfully simple and versatile recipe. I have made this probably a dozen times now with a few changes: 1. a whole onion 2. a half can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce (makes it velvety and rich) 3. liberal red pepper flakes and some chili powder 4. Increase to 3T of curry powder 5. cut down to 2T sugar or less.  

I make it in a dutch oven and simmer uncovered. I usually reduce the sugar further, then add a cup of frozen peas and about half a bell pepper for sweetness. Also goes great with paneer and/or cauliflower.

This was amazing! My only changes were that  I added some frozen peas and carrots the last 10 minutes, thickened it with corn starch and served it with fresh chopped cilantro.  We will be having this on our regular menu rotation!

This was really good. I used Garam Masala spice since that is what I had.  I followed the review that said to cook the spice in oil for about 5 minutes and then add onions for ten minutes etc. I didn't have any garlic cloves so I used garlic powder. I doubled the recipe since we have a big family and there are tons left over. The sauce is so good I could drink it for soup.

As a curry novice, I was looking for a recipe close to what I'd had when  dining out. This was it! I love, love, love the coconut in this recipe! My only adjustment was to omit the sugar as I didn't think it was needed since the coconut milk is already sweet. Do NOT skip the first step of cooking the curry in the oil. This releases the curry flavor that would otherwise be very mild. I served over Jasmine rice.

We enjoyed this very much.  I cooked the curry powder and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in canola oil  medium low heat for five minutes, I then added the onions and cooked for 10 minutes, and then the garlic for 2 more.  I then raised the heat to medium high and added the chicken, stirring until it was coated , then lowered the heat to medium and cooked for 10 minutes.  I then stirred in the unsweetened coconut milk, a can of diced tomatoes, and 1/2 a can of tomato sauce and cooked that uncovered for 50 minutes at medium low to medium.  In the last minute I added a cup of frozen peas that were mostly thawed.  I did not add the sugar.  I will definitely make this again, but I will increase the curry and cayenne pepper for a spicier dish.

I loved the basic recipe.  The second time I made it though I used only 2T of the sugar, added sliced carrots, celery and used green onions.  Served over brown rice cooked in chicken stock.  Delish!

Didn't have a ton of flavor (which surprised me since it seemed like a lot of curry), though I messed up and forgot to buy stewed tomatoes so I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and put some navy beans in it for texture instead which could be part of the problem. Not overly spicy but it has a little bit of heat.

Easy to make, and got rave reviews from the entire family. The only thing that needs to be done is realizing that the dish needs to cook WAY LONGER than the recipe specifies. I probably cooked it for an hour or more at high heat in order to get the sauce to thicken... but it was definitely worth the wait!  Will make again for sure.

Pretty good, it didn't really thicken up like in the picture though.  I simmered for an hour but it was still a little runny. Added some veggies near the end of the simmering (carrots, broccoli, bell peppers)   Next time I think I'll add some cornstarch to thicken a tad more.

It's very easy to make yet very delicious. I didn't have canned tomato and tomato paste at home, I skip them. Instead I add 3 carrots chopped, 1/2 onion chopped, lemon juice from 1.5 fresh lemon. After shimming, I add 1tbsp starch dissolve in 2 tbsp water to thicken the stew. My family love it very much.

This was my first time trying my hand in cooking curried chicken of any kind. My family and friends were very impressed by the different flavor profiles.  It is easy enough for a beginner to cook, but tasty enough to give the cook "chef" status. 5 stars

This was awesome! My son won't eat anything that has vegetables visible in it, and I also didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I made do with a small jar of red sofrito instead of the tomatoes and it was perfect! I thought it wasn't spicy enough and a little too sweet, so I added a pinch more salt and some crushed red pepper and cayenne. Definitely on our fave list!

This makes for an excellent base, but I wouldn't serve this as is. In addition to the spices called for in the recipe, I added bay leaves, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, ground ginger, ground cardamom, and red pepper flakes to taste. I omitted the sugar for both preference and health.

Because of how much my partner and I like vegetables, I also added 1/4 of a bell pepper (which I fried with the onion and garlic), frozen peas and broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms.
I preferred this with a salad rather than rice/naan, but to each their own.

I loved this recipe, but in order for my 14 year old to love it, I only used 1 tablespoon of curry. For some reason my dish did not look like the picture. It had more tomato liquid, almost soup-like. Very delicious. Had so much left over that I made soup with the rest. I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and some pasta stars and served it with a baguette.

Excellent, simple, quick, fail-safe recipe. I had to use mild curry and used Golden Curry Sauce Mix, two cubes. My family has sensitive palates, but still snuck in a little Cayenne red pepper and Bodine's Memphis sweet heat dry rub - contains garlic salt, ancho chili peppers, molasses, coffee, onions, and natural spices with no MSG.  Delicious!

I  made a double batch, and it came out great.  I had too much liquid, so if you make a double batch, don't use all of the juice from the stewed tomatoes and use about a can and a half of the coconut milk.

We lover this recipe, though I did adjust the amounts of curry and sugar based on my family's tastes. When I am in a hurry, I admit that I cheat and use 1 can of tomato soup, 1 can of diced tomatoes with chillis and 1 can of coconut milk.  The husband seems to like it best that way, but the premise is the same. Thanks for a great recipe!

It took a lot longer (twice) than called for to thicken the broth, but will make again.

I couldn't find Indian curry so I used a red Thai curry paste and that made the dish too sweet. I'll try it again with the proper curry, though next time I don't intend to cook the chicken all the way at the beginning like the recipe says. After cooking it and then simmering for 30-40 minutes for the sauce to thicken, the chicken came out dry.

This has Become a family favorite now! Super easy to make, with a very flexible recipe.  Me and my wife put fresh tomatoes and avacado on ours, My daughter ate it with rice as is.  After making it once i can already think of a dozen other ways to make it.

I am happy that I read the reviews before making this dish as my husband and I like spicy. We used double the curry and added red pepper flakes and it was amazing. We will definitely make this one again.

Very good and easy to make. doubled the diced tomatoes and left out tomato sauce and added tomato paste. Did mix up two tablespoons of cornstarch and water and added to get sauce to thicken a little faster.Added a little hot pepper flakes to give it a bit of a bite. Served over french fries. Loved it . Will definitely make again.

I LOVE this recipe.  Followed it as directed but along with the reviews I simmered it uncovered and added some diced potato and crushed red pepper to give it some spice.  I'll add peas next time.  Served over Basmati rice.  This will definitely be in my rotation.  It was my first attempt at curry and a great easy start!

This is the first curry dish that I have ever made. I was so worried with the amount and smell of the curry at first! However, it is so delicious that it has become a favorite. My children (ages 9 & 13) cheer when they learn that I'm making this for dinner.  The recipe as written is perfect. Sometimes I add vegetables such as mushrooms, peppers, zucchini and/or carrots. Surprisingly, the carrots are my favorite. They really absorb the curry flavor.

I think this was really good.  My husband is from Ghana and anything that I prepare for him must have A LOT of taste and texture.  Needless to say, he loves Caribbean and Indian food.  I have to say that I did not add as much sugar and I left out the can of tomato sauce.  I thought it could use more coconut milk, but it was still a hit.  Just small adjustments were made.  This will be my "go to" for a Caribbean cooking.

This was delicious! From other reviews,  I used curry paste instead of powder, reduced sugar to 2, increased the garlic and used culinary coconut milk by so delicious. I will add more veggies next time for a little more nutrition boost but this is a keeper! I also simmered for 30 min uncovered to thicken.

Me and my husband loved this recipe so much, the coconut milk added makes the food bit heavy but its worth it. Anyway, i ditched the tomato sauce because I felt it will take all the attention (taste) from the coconut and I added chicken broth to add a stronger flavor. Will definitely try this again.

It was savory, but too sweet for my taste, and not nearly spicy enough. Were I to make it again, I'd use chicken thighs versus breasts,  leave out the tomato sauce and sugar, and add maybe a little extra spice to heat it up a bit.

I do agree with some of the reviewers on it tasting like canned tomato soup. With that said it is still a really good beginner curry sauce. Everyone I made it for enjoyed the way it tasted. Also, some reviewers are complaining about the sauce not thickening, simmer it for about 60mins with no cover! check on it every once in awhile just to stir  Enjoy!

Could have sworn that I had tomato sauce before I started it, but turned out to be mistaken.  Other than that I made no changes and it still turned out delicious.  Definitely will become part of my regular rotation.

This was delicious! Though as written it wasn't successful for me. Cooking the curry powder initially on med high resulted in burnt curry and a do over. Thankfully I only wasted oil and curry powder. I had to cook it on med low to cook it for 2 mins and upped the temp to med when I added the onions and garlic. I also used a whole chicken cut into smallish pieces. I also only had cut tomatoes so I added just that,  1 tb less sugar and about 1/2 tb more kosher salt as I found it desperately needed more at the end. It was too runny at the end of the cooking time so I cooked it on high stirring the entire time for 15 mins to reduce the liquid. Next time I'll just keep it on med stirring occasionally with no lid after I add the coconut milk (unsweetened is DEFINITELY the way to go)

I am new to cooking and this was my very first time cooking with curry.  This recipe turned out really nice. I did make a few minor modifications. I used 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes, which was enough. I also used Olive Oil and had to add about 1/3 cup more to the recipe. Overall this is a nice, easy recipe even for beginners. *thumbs up*

This was extremely good and easy to make. I followed the recipe almost exactly;however, instead of using curry powder, I used red curry paste (2 tbsp) and used about 6 fresh Roma tomatoes (deseeded)  instead of the can of diced tomatoes. It was awesome! A huge hit with my family of 6- ranging from 19 yrs to 2 yrs. Quick and delicious! I would definitely recommend making!

I didn't add the tomato sauce (it just didn't sound right) and I had no problems with thickening but it was super bland. So I added about a tablespoon of peanut butter and made it a peanut curry. It was ok, but it still needed more spice. Maybe a little heat? I also would add pineapple and peanuts next time, made some green onions...

Great flavours!  I found the sauce a bit thin so let it simmer with the lid off to reduce and it turned out great.

It's good but I've read many authentic Indian cookbooks and you should have a curry paste cooked in oil 5-minutes then add onion and your spices go from there..I'm happy to find this on allrecipes.com :) thnx for sharing

followed the suggestion of cooking curry powder first then adding onion/garlic for 10 min. LOVED IT! Maybe add some more spice if u like spicy curry.

SOOOO delicious!  Per a top reviewer suggestion I doubled the sauce w/the 2 lbs chicken.  SO glad I did!  I would think it would have been dry if I didn't.  I also added more curry to taste, because of the extra sauce.  Finally, I completely forgot about the tomato sauce (even though I had it!) and it was so devine that I may just make it again without it.  We just absolutely loved this!  3 people ate over half!

I used fresh diced tomatoes for the canned ones. those are less acidic so I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons.
I also used only 1 1/2 pound of chicken breasts and that was plenty for a family of 4.
You need to cook this uncovered the whole cooking time or increase the heat to high and uncover the last 15 minutes to have a nice thick sauce.

Delicious and easy recipe for beginners like me. Served over jasmine rice and a side of naan. I read almost every review before cooking. Like others, I "cooked" the curry powder for about 5 min in the oil before adding the garlic and onion. I then cooked the garlic and onion for 10 min over medium low. I also drained the tomatoes and only added half the can of tomato sauce. Simmered for 1 hour uncovered and it did not turn out runny at all. Next time I might add more coconut milk/tomato sauce as i prefer more sauce to pour over rice and naan but I wonder if that would make it too runny? Next time I will use a higher quality curry powder (I used mccormick which worked well but it didn't make me feel like it was authentic curry haha) I also thought of using curry paste but I was going for more of an Indian flavor rather than Thai. Overall great recipe!

I used madras curry instead of yellow curry...then didn't need to add the pepper or other spices. Wanted a thinner sauce so added some chicken broth at the end of cooking. Chicken was so tender. Will make again!

It was just OK. It tasted like spicy cream of tomato soup. Maybe that's the taste they were going for, but it wasn't for me. I will not make this again.

This was so good!  Pungent, aromatic, delicious.  It was a tad too sweet and I will likely reduce the sugar next time; I doubled the onions because we love onions.  I took the excellent advice of previous reviewers who said to make a "broth" of the curry, oil, and spices, heating before adding the onions and then cooking the onions until translucent before adding remaining ingredients.  The gravy thickened nicely in the stated cooking time, but I admit to turning it up a tad to a gentle boil, more than a slow simmer.   It's a keeper!

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste mixed with water and it still came out yummy. Only thing I'm wanting to do is turn the heat up on it with a little cayenne . I haven't tried that yet. The whole family liked this meal.

It was great, and so easy to make, even for a kitchen newbie like me.  The only thing I left out was the tomato sauce, didn't have any in the pantry.  But turned out great, not to hot and my wife liked it too.

This recipe is yummy my family loves it (husband and 3 children ages (10, 7, 3)). I have made it several times.  This last time I have to say I didn’t follow the recipe as written.  I only used 1 tbs. sugar and instead of 2 tbs. of curry I added 3, also 1 whole onion and only used ¼ cup of tomato sauce since I didn’t drain the canned tomatoes.  I have made it with fresh garlic and also with garlic powder. You can also add chopped mango and the combination is really tasty.

I really like this recipe....The kids ate with no complaints.  the husband however thought it was a Mexican dish and was disappointed when I told him it was "Indian" more of a head than stomach issue for him i guess...oh well.  eating the leftovers for lunch as I type. I give 3 stars simply because I expected a stronger coconut flavor...still easy and tasty

Thought this was amazing. Great for people trying to eat clean. Not too many ingredients or starches. The only thing I changed is I used agave syrup instead of sugar (simply because I don't eat sugar) and I added slides mushrooms and cilantro because I thought they sounded like  a good addition. Hats off the to the creator! :)

This is an excellent recipe as it is.  Tonight, I'm going to modify it a bit to make it more like the way my Indonesian friend made hers. adding carrots, potatoes, lemongrass, ginger.

This is such a fantastic recipe that I usually double it when I make it. It also freezes really well, so that’s a bonus. One change that I do make it is to reduce the amount of chicken by at least 25 to 30%. I like the dish to have more sauce to it and in order to get that I have to reduce the chicken. The measurements are perfect just the way they are, but sometimes I add Extra garlic and a hint of ginger.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written above and it came out very good. Extremely tasty and I will definitely be making this again. The only reason I give it 4 starts is due to my own ignorance, I guess. I had a taste for Thai red curry, but didn't realize that it was not actually the same as this recipe. Thai red curry has a bit more of a coconut taste to it, which I'm sure this dish would have if I had omitted either the tomato sauce or stewed tomatoes. Either way, it was great and I recommend it!

Loved it!!! We wouldn't make any significant alterations except adding the whole onion.  I would use some sort of flavored rice, like basmati. I'm sure this will be a family favorite for years to come, especially since my lactose intolerant husband loves creamy dishes and this fit the bill with the coconut milk. Wonderful!

OMG this was amazing!!  I wanted to do something different!  I am a fan of curry and a fan of coconut.  To my knowledge I have never had the 2 together.  Sooooo good!  I also followed the tips of Cook Stephanie and Chef Joy!  Thanks so much!!

I used fresh tomatoes cut into small pieces and cook it separately.  I added carrots and red bell pepper. I also added fish sauce which add more flavour to the dish.  Surely has a good taste.

I read the reviews so I added 3 quarter potatoe, red pepper flakes and 3 cut up Roma tomatoes instead of all the can tomatoes. I only added 1 TBS sugar that was perfect for us.  I used 4 cloves of roasted garlic and a whole skin off chicken I roughly cut up leaving all bones except the rib cage.  Delish!  I served with rice and a roasted veggies.

Absolutely LOVED it! The flavored are fantastic. I couldn't stop eating it! Wow . I'm a huge curry fan and I have had so many different kinds of curry, even authentic homemade curry from an Indian neighbor and I can say this is one of the best I've ever had! I used lite coconut milk and added carrots when I added in the milk and sauces and it was amazing. I strained the stewed tomatoes so I didn't end up with too thin of a sauce. I read all the reviews and instead of simmering on low covered I simmered on medium heat uncovered for about 35 minutes and then added one tablespoon of cornstarch and my husband and I both really liked the thickness this way. Not too thick but definitely not sauces or thin. Perfect for serving over rice , which is what we did. Hubby approved and he is a picky eater. I got two big thumbs up from him.

Because I added potatoes, carrots and bell peppers, I needed to double the sauce.  So I doubled the curry powder, coconut milk and tomato sauce, but I didnt have a 2nd can of tomato sauce so I used 1 cup heinz  ketchup.  Its a huge hit with my family and multi-cultural friends!  Thank you for this easy piecey recipe!  So good!

This was the first time I made curry and the first coconut based dish too.  I loved it, as did my 84 year old father who has more conservative "American" taste.  The recipe was even better as leftovers, as the flavors mixed together nicely and blended over time.  Loved it and will make again.

I have made this a couple dozen times, its delicious!! Very forgiving with substitutions and generous adjustments in proportions of ingredients, I just use what I have on hand (additional veggies, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms!) The house always smells heavenly afterwards! A big favorite in our household.

My family loved this. I don't like curry powder so I have to go on their feedback and my husband said this is restaurant quality. I did make some changes to suit my family"s tastes: added chopped carrots, used a whole large sweet onion, omitted the sugar, upped the curry powder to 3 Tbsp, omitted the tomato sauce, used a jar of whole tomatoes that I crushed, and added some freshly grated ginger. Oh, and I used coconut oil. This may sound like a lot of changes, but it really didn't change the spirit of the dish at all. The liquid thickened up nicely, too. The only thing this needs is some heat. Next time I will add a chopped hot pepper or cayenne.

Overall it was a good base for a simple curry dish.  I added some fresh minced ginger and a Jalapeno.  I also created a slurry of 2 Tblsp Cornstarch and equal amount of water to thicken it up a bit since it was kind of watery.  Next time, I would add some veggies (Peas, Peppers, etc.), omit the sugar and add another Tbsp. of curry powder and possibly add some Cayenne pepper or ground Thai chili peppers.  It was a little bland for my taste, the curry flavor was masked by the sugar.

Like most people I did make changes to the recipe.  I still think that the recipe deserves 5 stars because even though I didn't follow it exactly I couldnt have made the meal I did without it. First I used chicken thighs cut up instead of breasts.  After chicken was done cooking in curry oil I added sliced zucchini, sliced yellow squash, peas, and chopped yellow pepper because I wanted some vegetables.  I omitted the tomato sauce altogether but did use canned diced tomatoes.  Also used generic lite coconut milk.  I didnt have to add a curry paste or anything.  I followed the recipe exactly except for those changes. I served it over mashed cauliflower instead of rice and it was delicious.  It was very soupy but I don't mind.  Might want to thicken it up if you want a thicker sauce.  This recipe will become a regular in my rotation.  This was absolutely yummy!

We love this recipe. It's easy, and tastes great. It DOES taste like a fancy tomato soup when its done, but it's good. I do recommend you cook it for as long as you can...at least 30mins. The juices will thicken up and make a lovely sauce.

I made this as directed and thought it was too sweet and didn't have any depth. Since I didn't care for it as written, I added a little vinegar to try to cut the sweetness, soy sauce,  fresh vegetables and black beans. I topped it with avocado and put it over brown rice. If I make it again, I would make it as I had adjusted it, but otherwise I will look for a different recipe.

Good recipe!   I made as written except used a bit of tomato paste w/water instead of sauce & I simmered uncovered for the time recommended.  Forgot to add the sugar, but I used 1Tbs. Penzey's Sweet Curry powder & 1Tbs. Penzey's Hot Curry powder and didn't think it needed any more sweet.  Very good basic coconut curry!

I really enjoyed this, but I think next time I will use half the tomato sauce (I prefer more of a curry flavor) and something to give it a little kick.

I followed this recipe almost exactly as written and couldn't have been happier! I did throw in a handful of golden raisins and some unsweetened coconut flakes (NOT shredded). Also, used fresh tomatoes, seeded, because it's what I had. My first time preparing the curry, however, I burnt it since I wasn't sure if I should stir it or not - turns out you should. :/ I also simmered UNCOVERED for about 90 minutes before it was thickened sufficiently. Served this over toasted almond rice pilaf, and made a cuke/carrot/raisin salad to go with it. Served with a wedge of orange. Outstanding flavor, definitely a keeper.

Tasted awesome.  It was cheap, fast, and easy.  Who new that these simple ingredients would make such an awesome meal. I did not change the recipe much at all except I added a bag of baby carrots and some potatos. Yummy. So great tasting. I felt like a pro.

I followed the recipe to the letter (as I always do the first time out) and it was great.  I would've liked even more curry powder, but since the rest of the family doesn't usually agree, I left it as it read and still thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used no-salt tomato sauce and petite diced tomatoes and everything was well balanced.  Can't wait to have it again!

Great recipe but I used fresh tomato instead of canned. didn't use tomato sauce and would've tasted better without the sugar!! too sweet. had to add thyme, habanero pepper and still too sweet. the sweetness from coconut  milk is enough.

I love this recipe! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the stewed tomatoes tasted bitter. However, I spooned them out  and it was amazing. I will be making this again. I served it over basmati rice and sprinkled just a little bit of sweetened shredded coconut flakes on top. And my family went wild!

Followed the recipe to the T... I did have to simmer the broth a lot longer than 45 minutes though.  This was a huge hit with my family, even the kids. I served it with basmati rice and some squash and carrots on the side.  This will be in my normal rotation for dinners!

I made this last night for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out good. Put it on rice with some Naan bread. Will make again. Easy also.

This was a good blend of flavors but did not have the heat I expected in a curry -- there was really no heat at all in the finished product even though the oil, curry, onion, and garlic mixture smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I am going to reduce the sugar in future, and also leave out the tomato sauce as others suggested to make it thicker.

This needed a little bit of spice adjustment for us.  We added garam masala, ground coriander, ground cumin, and a sprinkle of chili pepper flakes. We also cut back on the tomato sauce, just adding a little at a time until we got the taste and consistency we wanted.  This is a good base recipe that takes well to your additions of spice and vegetables. We'll use it again.

Wow, of course I had to tweak it, my own way, but YUM YUM. I added NO sugar or any other sweetener, other than dicing up a sweet Potato and cooking it mixed up in the main dish for the last 30/40 minutes. I also cooked jasmine rice with chicken broth, a Tbsp of turmeric powder and a Tbsp of Kelp powder. I added NO salt, no sugar. I did add more curry PASTE, I used a full heaping Tbsp... and then added a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper..................

I usually read a few reviews and then make changes, but this time I decided to stay true to the Posters Recipe, well except I boiled my chicken and then shredded it. But everything else was exact. And I have to say what wonderful flavor, I was thinking it would be really spicey and i'm not big on spice, and I was a little worried about the tomatoes, but wow does it bring out the flavor . Thank you for a great Recipe it's a Keeper!

I made this as stated, but used half a 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes in place of both the stewed tomatos/tomato sauce. Was slightly worried because it did taste simply like tomato sauce near the end. Added an extra tablespoon of curry powder, 1 tablespoon each Turmeric, and Cinnamon. Worked well. Simmered down thick within an hour and awesome flavor.

This "Curried Coconut Chicken" is the perfect "comfort meal." I couldn't stop eating it! I watched the Allrecipes "What's Cooking" video of ROMA (the recipe submitter) preparing the recipe and learned a few important tidbits that do not appear in the written recipe: (i) it is a "fusion" curry (multicultural); (ii) ROMA makes hers using a West Indian curry power (from Trinidad and Tobago); (iii) she would use dried hot peppers to give it some heat if desired (optional); and (iv) she uses sugar to bring out the sweetness of the coconut milk. The next time I make this recipe I will leave out the sweetener because I use a naturally sweet coconut milk. Thank you ROMA for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious! The sauce is the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The only ingredient change I made was to omit the stewed tomatoes, but that was just a matter of textural preference. Otherwise, I prepared the recipe as is, and served it over steamed white rice. I followed another chef's advice and simmered it all uncovered for 30 minutes versus covered, and the result was tender chicken and onions in a perfectly thickened sauce.

this recipe was ok just ok it turned out really sweet I don't know if the sugar was too much or was the stewed tomatoes. I only read one review about letting the spice heat up in the oil first before adding the onion I did that but that's about it. I have a lot of leftovers I'm going to go ahead and add some more spices after reading more reviews and try to see if I can save what is left over I do not want to throw away good check. this was just very bland and all I can taste with sweetness.

So delicious and easy to make. As recommended by a previous reviewer, I allowed the dish to simmer uncovered for 50 mins. The sauce turned out thick and creamy. I followed the recipe but added the following aromatics (as recommended by one of my favorite food bloggers): ginger, jalapeno (if you like it spicy), cilantro, and turmeric. This will definitely be on regular rotation in my home!

Awesome Recipe!! Made this exactly as written, otherwise I wouldn't be reviewing this recipe, would I? Simple to throw together and the flavors are awesome. I was concerned that it would either be too sweet or there wouldn't be enough curry flavor, no need. There was just a hint of coconut and for the average person, the curry flavor is just right. I am a huge curry fan, so I will most likely try increasing the curry powder a bit and see what happens. If you're looking for something with lots of flavor and easy to make, this is the dish for you.

Loved this recipe....though I did make a few teaks and plan to make more the next time I make it.  I doubled everything in the recipe except the chicken so we would have extra sauce.  The sauce is a bit on the sweet side, so next time I will reduce the sugar. And I tend to prefer spicy, so next time I will use spicy curry to add some kick. I cut some potatoes to add the broth and I added some sliced water chestnuts for texture. Yum!!,

Absolutely delicious!  I deboned 4 thighs and cooked the meat chunks a bit longer  Resized the recipe to 4 servings but used entire can of diced tomatoes, can of coconut minus 1/3 c. that was used in another recipe and a similar reduction  in tomato sauce (also used in another recipe).

This turned out pretty good. I was surprised by how nice the flavor was.  I only had 1 pound of chicken, but I added chickpeas and some other veggies.  It turned out great.  Everyone at work wanted to know what smelled so good at lunch the next day :)  I used the lite coconut milk.  I cut the sugar in half, but I still felt that it was too sweet.

This recipe was delicious! It really is so far the best curry I've made myself. The only thing was that it tasted quite a bit like tomatoes. But at the same time the tomatoes added something awesome to the end result. I definitely will make this again but maybe next time I will put less tomato and make sure to drain them really well before adding it. Thx for this delicious recipe!

Wow was this a DELICIOUS curry!  I followed Cook Stephanie's advice in cooking the curry in oil first, which creates a sort of thin curry paste, then sautéing the onions in that paste until translucent.  I added four minced cloves of garlic and sautéed for another minute before adding the chicken.  I wanted to incorporate veggies so at the end, I added half a head of cauliflower florets and 4 carrots chopped into rounds, cooked for ten minutes until veggies were al dente, then added a chopped zucchini and a sliced up red bell pepper. I
In an effort to reduce carbs, I served mine on a handful of baby spinach leaves (excellent!) and some yummy garlic Naan bread (Trader Joes).  
I used veggies I had on hand, but I could see the addition of garbanzo beans, green beans, eggplant, golden raisins, or whatever else you have on hand working very well.  EXCELLENT!  Thank you so much for posting Roma, my new go to curry recipe!

I used 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast, 3 tablespoons of curry powder, 1 large yellow onion, and 4 cloves of garlic. I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes on hand so I used a 12 oz. jar of roasted red peppers without the liquid instead.  I added about 1/2-1 teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg and 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes. Also I only simmered the stew for about 25 mins., any longer and the chicken would have been over cooked and dry. To thicken, I scooped out about 2 cups of the sauce and blended it with about 2 tablespoons of flour until all the lumps were out. Stirred the mixture back into the pot and simmered for another 5 minutes. PERFECTION!!!

This has become an instant favorite. I left out the garlic and onions since hubby won't eat those, but in my opinion, it would be even yummier made as written! One reviewer advised using SWEETENED coconut milk ... NO NO NO! The Thai coconut milk in a can is what you want, and it is not sweetened. You are adding sugar already ... to use the sweetened coconut milk would be just too much, I think. Anyway, GREAT RECIPE, as written!

I love this recipe!!

My husband and daughter are from West Africa and I am constantly trying to find recipes that will satisfy their taste as well as my own. This recipe is one of the most delicious meals that I have ever made. I added 1 additional tablespoon of curry powder for extra flavor.  I am definitely adding this to my menu.

This recipe was awesome! Followed the recipe almost exactly, and I was surprised how good it was. Rarely use coconut milk, so I don't know if that was the secret ingredient, but this will certainly be a recipe I will make again in the future!

This is a winter favorite at our house.  The seasoning is flavorful, but quite mild.  I like to add a few potatoes and some diced carrots and serve the whole thing down over a bowl of rice . Mmmmm, comfort food.

I made it as written, but didn't care for the strong tomato taste. Like canned soup, as another reviewer said. I fixed it by adding waaay more curry and some half and half. Then it was good, but I missed having some potatoes in it, and maybe peas. I think I'll try a different curry recipe next time.

It was really bland.  I was expecting a nice curry kick.  If I were to make it again I'd add a LOT more curry powder and less tomato.

I had this amazing chicken curry in some obscure Indian restaurant in Manhattan 14 years ago. I had tried to come up with a similar thing for years, and finally gave up. Then one day I tried this recipe and it was very, very similar. We love it. It has become a staple dinner in our home. I do a few things just a little differently. I only add 1 tbs of sugar and sometimes an extra tbs of curry powder. And I don't simmer it a long time. I just fry the onion, garlic, olive oil, curry powder, salt, and pepper together until the chicken is cooked. Then I add the coconut milk, simmer for like 5 minutes, then the tomatoes and sugar and simmer for 5 more minutes. The total time usually takes between 20 and 30 minutes to have a yummy, simple dinner on the table for my 10 children and husband.

Pretty good. I was looking for a recipe to use the chicken I thawed and use the can of coconut milk I had. I used chicken thighs instead of breast; and I only had 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce (I think it would have been too tomato-y). Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out well, but a little too sweet (and I even reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons). I will amke it again though because the family liked it.

I frequently make this recipe for my family, and they love it. I tweak it a little bit each time I make it, but it's wonderful just as it's written. And it's even better the next day, as with most curry dishes.

Awesome!! Have made many times now! Have made it with and without tomatoes and both are great! Sauteed the curry first in olive oil and usually double the onion and garlic.  Also use honey to sweeten it. Great foolproof recipe!

I thought this was a very solid dish. I did my best to follow the recipe exactly, but I had some canned whole tomatoes that I substituted for the tomato sauce. I think that went a long way toward making the flavor amazing (they were tomatoes from my garden), though also made the curry a bit soupy because of water content. This was really yummy! My husband loved it too. We had it over regular rice one night, then sushi rice another night (real curry connouisseurs would shudder I'm sure), and leftover mashed potatoes another time. Delish.

Wow, DE-LI-CIOUS!!  My husband and older son loved it and both had seconds.  It made a large amount.  The broth was fabulous and not what I was expecting.  Everything worked together for a subtle, delicious flavor.  I think you could use other meats/proteins (pork, beef, lentils).  You could add some diced potatoes.  I think all would be good with this sauce.  I will definitely make again.  Thank you for this recipe.  Update: I have made this recipe 3 times now.  The last 2 times I used ground chicken (buy it on sale).  It is still delicious and makes it so quick to make.  Picky younger son told me "you can make this for me if you want".  Definitely a great compliment to the dish! SECOND UPDATE:  I continue to love this dish.  I now have a vegetarian son so I substitute chick peas for the chicken.  I typically double the sauce recipe and start the process as advised by Chef Stephanie.  I always double the sauce to have leftovers to send with my boys.  I let the sauce simmer uncovered for as long as I need to and then add canned, drained chick peas during the last 15-20 minutes before serving to heat through.  I use 2-3 cans for a double sauce amount. Sometimes I add thawed drained green peas and sometimes not. Served over basamati rice-YUM.  Goes well with naan and salad, too!!  Love this and so do my boys!!

This was spectacular! Aside from inhaling some curry powder while cooking, the dish was a delicious success. It's surprising, because I typically hate spicy things, but this was so flavorful that the hint of heat wasn't a problem at all! My fiance will be coming home soon, and he loves curry, so I hope he'll love this curry chicken. If he does, then I have a feeling that this will be a go-to dinner for us, as well as for our friends when they come over. Thank you so much!

Fantastic recipe.  Followed it as written other than using more than 2 lbs of chicken, light coconut milk and omitted the sugar.  There was plenty of sauce.  My family loved it.  The flavors meld together well; none overshadows the other.  Served it with brown rice.

I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving it to simmer for 50 minutes, as per some of the other reviews. It was perfect. So delicious, and everyone in the family loved it.

Yummy recipe. Like anything else you need to make it your own. Don't be scared to taste it before its finished. I added red pepper flakes to give it a little bit more spice. I also realized in order to achieve the yellow color DON'T add the tomato sauce however, I did add the tomato sauce and I LOVED it.

I use the whole fat (unsweetened) coconut milk. I also added a Tablespoon or two of fish sauce. We love this!

Love this recipe! I add a bit of extra coconut milk to make it a little creamier, and also find adding cashews before covering to simmer to really complement it well!

This is amazing! Made it just like it says. Make rice on the side, pour it over and oh my. Tastes just like the restaurant. You may want to add some hot peppers because this is not very hot. Loved it!

If you have a taste for curry, this is quick and easy. The coconut milk gives it a mild creamy flavor, not strong curry.  The family really liked it.

Both my husband and I thought it was great.  I made it in the crock pot (due to laziness).  I have a crock pot that will let you saute things, so I sauteed the garlic, onion, oil and curry for a bit, then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it covered on low for a few hours.  I cheated and used a little corn starch to thicken it up and it was wonderful over some couscous with peas on the side.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe!  I added green onion to my onion/garlic mix. Once chicken was cooked, I tossed in baby bella slices. When dish had finished simmering I added a cup of defrosted baby sweet peas. Today, I cooked a new batch with no chicken, let it cool a bit, jarred it up and sent it to several neighbors as a simmer sauce. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

This was very very good! A few modifications: I used red curry paste instead of powder. Dredged the chicken in coconut flour.  I also used unsweetened coconut milk & substituted Splenda for sugar to make this diabetic-friendly.

I followed this recipe and I like it. This was my first time making my own curry from scratch. I used Madra curry powder, and actually find that my curry powder isn't very strong. The next time I make this I would probably use more curry powder. Other than that it's quite enjoyable.

Beautiful combination, I've made various coconut curry dishes and they are usually too sweet, or something is over powering something else, but this was perfect. This might sound weird, but i think it would taste good with lamb as well.

One of my husband's favorites! We looked for a long time for a good, sweet, yellow curry recipe and finally found this one. The only modification we've made from the original was a suggestion of my mother-in-law's—cubed sweet potatoes, boiled separately first and added in to simmer. They add a little extra sweetness and nutrition. Delicious either way, though!

I loved this recipe! This is the first time I have ever tried to make my own curry and now I'm hooked! I can't wait to try it with shrimp, fish, and beef! I cut down the serving size to meet the needs of my household now I'm sad I didn't make the 6 servings as it was written because it turned out so delicious and I want more. The only thing I did differently was to let it cook longer so my sauce would thicken more and the flavors would deepen.

Far too much tomato sauce and not enough spice. Still, a pretty easy base for a curry.

This was an amazing, flavorful, and simple recipe only using a few ingredients. These are similar flavors to chicken tikka masala except that instead of cream, the sauce uses a coconut milk. I doubled up on the garlic and seasoned the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Serve on a bed of white rice and top of with cilantro. Delicious!

I originally found this recipe because I was looking for something to use a can of coconut milk with, that wasn't sweet.  I have only made this once, so far.  I did not have enough curry powder, maybe 1 1/4 Tbsp, but otherwise I followed the recipe with the suggestion of another review, to cook a little longer.  It was very good, and will be even better with the full amount of curry powder.  I served it with rice and a mix of zucchini, squash, carrots, and onions.  We all liked it, and I am looking forward to making it again.

Awesome recipe! Made a few changes: I used 2.5 tbsp of curry powder, an entire onion, 18oz of diced tomato drained,  2 tbsp of tomato sauce and 14 oz of chicken stock.  I also added diced sweet potato and frozen peas! Delicious recipe, will definitely be making again and again.

The recipe came out good. I substituted the ginger and curry powder into a curry paste because I hate doing the ginger. I just thought the sauce was runny, not sure if that's how it should be or if it should be thicker. I like it though and I might cook it again.

I would say 3.8 stars it was surprisingly good, especially considering that we are not huge curry fans. My yougest liked it too, so even better.

This dish was amazing. I normally don't mix a lot of different ingredients together, but have been forced to get out of my comfort zone because I have grown bored with my cooking. I'm breaking out of my shell with this dish. Instead of using chicken I used Talapia. I also used only about 10% of my can of tomato sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe. It's delicious served over jasmine rice. My sister was even impressed.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it has turned out great each time. I made a few slight changes, as another suggested I let the onions cook longer in the curry, about five minutes, before adding the chicken. I also substituted cubed boneless chicken thighs and thought they were almost more tender when used in a recipe that has to simmer for a long time. Instead of using a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and a 14oz can of tomato sauce, I just used one 28oz can of the diced tomatoes. I also reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp and added a splash of rice wine vinegar to make the sauce more balanced. Finally, to let the flavor really develop I simmered the sauce for at least 1.5 hours, until the tomatoes start to break down. This is excellent with steamed jasmin rice and tastes even better the next day!

Love this recipe.  I recommend it even if you don't like all of the ingredients.  My family does not like: onions, tomato's, or coconut. We do however like Indian food. I cook my onions and curry powder in olive oil until the onions are translucent.  Add some minced garlic and cook until browned. Add whole peeled tomato's (can or fresh)with juice to make sure I get all the curry out of the pan. I then poor everything but chicken into blender and blend until smooth. I then add my sauce, chicken, and cut up potato's to my tagine (clay cooking pot), marinate for 1-2 hours, and cook at 275 for 4-6 hours. Family loves and house smells amazing!!

Yummers! My boyfriend only eats chicken and seafood, so I  am always looking for new recipes so I am not bored to tears. I made this recipe as written and must say that it was very tasty. It was a little bit runny after simmering for nearly an hour, but I added cornstarch towards the end to thicken it. The next time I will reduce the liquid and add a little heat to balance the sweetness..maybe a little crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper. At any rate, I loved it and my honey did, too!

I added a third of a bottle of beer and about another tsp of salt to 'tame' the dominant sweet coconut flavor. We liked it this way better, but the original recipe is yummy too. I also added about another cup of water to make it go further.

Love, love this recipe!  The only small change I make to the ingredients is to use diced tomatoes because I don't have to chop up the stewed tomatoes. When I cook it, I skip the simmer and let it boil for about 30 minutes to reduce the liquids, then I cut it down to low and let it simmer while I make rice and veggies.  The end result is tender, tasty chicken chunks and a thick, well-blended sauce.  The only complaint I've had is from the hubs who wants more spice, but my picky 5-year-old eats it, so Daddy will have to be okay with the missing spice. ;)

This dish turned out DELICIOUS but was so mild that I added ANOTHER 4 tbsp. of curry powder. I substituted diced potatoes, cauliflower, carrots and frozen peas for the chicken, and left out the sugar. I followed the recipe exactly except because I didn't use chicken, I tossed the raw veggies (except peas) into the sauce and simmered for about 90 mins. I threw the frozen peas in for the last 10 mins. and served over basmati rice. Next time I will cook the veggies before adding to the sauce because even after 90 mins. they still were not quite soft enough. I'm looking forward to making this with chicken when my vegetarian isn't home.

This is awesome. I like curry so I add extra curry to make the taste splendid! Also, curry is a great lactation enabler.  If you read the ingredients, it's made out of fenugreek. Awesome recipe! I love it and I just had a baby so it's just so timely!

Absolutely Delicious! But, I recommend that this recipe be very specific about using either unsweetened or sweetened coconut milk.  Some reviewers are adamant about one or the other. So, if you question the 3 T. of sugar called for (some say it's too much), it largely depends on the type of coconut milk you use! I used unsweetened milk, and the 3 T. of sugar was perfect. Had I used sweetened coconut milk, I would have definitely decreased the sugar amount. This fact alone could make or break the recipe. 
Curry powders differ greatly, too, so just experiment! I use Madras Hot Curry Powder and increased the amount to 3 T.  Cook Stephanie has great advice to "cook the curry powder in the oil until it's ready - usually about 5 minutes. Then add the onion & spice - cook until the onion is translucent. This will take about 10 minutes, but it makes all the difference in the world. Add more oil as the onion is cooking, if necessary."  (I use coconut oil in this dish.) 
The only other change I made was with the tomatoes -- I used about 24 oz. of canned diced tomatoes (part of a large can), and added no tomato sauce. That way, we had more sauce. It all thickened up nicely after simmering for 60 to 90 minutes, which allowed us time to sip wine and visit. 
We were supposed to go out to dinner the night after serving this, but we decided to stay home instead, because we had leftover Curried Coconut Chicken in the fridge!

Awesome! I made this dish for my Caribbean food loving boyfriend. He loved it. I did make a few substitutes, I used minced garlic and chicken thighs. And I added sliced thick potatoes and baby carrots. I let the veggies cook in the sauce a little while I cooked the chicken separately seasoned with curry powder, onion powder, and garlic powder before adding it to the curry sauce pot. I also added additional curry powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt to taste. After letting it cook for a little until I felt everything was tender, I pulled it off the eye and let it sit.  This was awesome over rice and a little cabbage on the side, Caribbean style!

I have tried this recipe many times since I first started to cook (five years ago). It has almost always tasted delicious (unless I used not-so-good quality coconut milk), yet was easy to make. More recently I've experimented with this by substituting fish and eggplant instead of chicken (I added the eggplant in after the onions browned, pan seared the fish separately and added it in the end when the curry thickened).

The key to making this curry yummy-as-possible is to let it simmer as long as it needs to for it to thicken. 30-40 minutes didn't cut it for me (it would still be pretty watery. For me it took about 1.5-2 hours for it to reach a nice thick consistency.

So tasty! We will be adding this to our menu. I didn't have curry powder on hand so I used red curry paste, we really enjoyed the flavor. I would add maybe more garlic and red pepper flakes for spice. We like it hot!

It was OK, but seemed to be lacking a depth of flavor.  It was just hot from the curry, but not "interesting".  I even cooked the curry longer in the oil before adding other ingredients as recommended by other reviewers.  Bummed, as I was looking for a yummy "welcome home" dish for my daughter who loves this type of dish.  Will keep looking.

I've made this dish many times and it always turns out excellent. The only change I've made is I only add 1 tbsp of sugar and use crushed or puréed tomatoes because I don't like the consistency of the diced variety at all.  And I brown the chicken first, take it out of the pan and follow the recipe as is. I let it simmer uncovered and I find that it helps thicken the sauce and keeps it from being runny. You can add snap peas, potatoes and bell peppers, or whatever vegetable you like. This dish tastes better the next day.  My ex, who is a very picky eater and loves Indian cuisine, loves this and asks me to make this all the time. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is Amazing!!!  I have recently fell in love with this dish at a local Thai restaurant and decided to make it at home.  Not only is this recipe delicious but it blows away the version I originally fell for.  I followed all of the instructions as is except I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to not only make it a bit healthier but to enhance the coconut flavor.  I also added diced sweet potato, zucchini, red bell pepper, and shredded carrots to make it a bit heartier.  I also added 2 chicken bullion cubes, chopped cilantro, a pinch of cumin, and some cayenne pepper to kick up the flavor a bit more.  I served it over jasmine rice with a quick squeeze of lime juice.  Was hoping to have left overs but it was completely devoured within seconds of me plating it.  Can't wait to make again!!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! We made it without the stewed tomatoes because neither of us enjoy tomatoes, but we left the tomato sauce in. Definitely will make this again! I took leftovers to work the next day and everyone commented on how good it smelled. It tasted just as good!

This was delicious!  My family is asking when I will make it again.  I used unsweetened coconut milk and it was fine.  I simmered with no cover for about 45 minutes and the sauce really thickened up.  Served with jasmine rice.  Leftovers were eaten with naan bread - yum!

I cook the curry in the oil for the two or so minutes it says, but when I add the garlic and onion, I cook them at least 5 before adding Chicken. Do NOT use the tomato sauce, it makes it too saucy and tomatoey (I made a word). :-)

I've made this several times.  It's very good and easy to hide other veggies in.  Curry is such a strong flavor that kale and shredded carrots are easily blended in.

This will be the second time I'm making this recipe. Was very yummy and hubby liked it too! I especially love when food makes my house smell good, so this recipe is great. I used garlic tomatoe sauce and added bell pepper and pineapple the last 15 minutes. This recipe is great to add to or just eat as is. Thanks for sharing!

I dumped a lot of curry powder in, 2 Tablespoons doesn't begin to add enough flavor.  I might have put 1/3 cup, and it was awesome.  I served it over spagetti squash.  Very healthy, low cal, filling dinner!

Delicious recipe. The only things I added were red chili flakes, quartered potatoes, and some sliced carrots. This really hit the spot.

Pretty good recipe. I added a little regular milk aside from the coconut milk and I also added yellow potatoes and bell peppers to the mix. I used some cumin and tumeric for more flavor and cinnamon and some coriander. Otherwise this recipe came out wonderfully.

I've made this twice and the first time I doubled the sauce and added too much spice (red pepper flakes). This time a forgot the sugar. Both times my dish was still crave-able and will be a staple in my home! Thank you for sharing.

I have never made a curry dish, but w/ the great reviews decided to give it a shot.  I used UNSWEETENED coconut cream (cream by mistake) but it came out perfect and creamy and i'd probably make that mistake again since it was so good.  I also subbed out the normal sugar for coconut sugar, but think i 100% could have done w/out it all together.  All tomato products I purchased were also no sugar added.  and I drained the tomatoes.  The flavors went so perfectly together and the leftovers the next day were even better.  Will def be making this regularly.

This was delicious.  I followed some recommendations and omitted the tomato sauce, added a couple of red potatoes, and increased the curry.  My husband and I loved it.  Will be making this dish often.

I made the recipe almost exactly as written (I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the curry for 5 mins and the onion for 10 before I threw in the chicken to coat and cook). I also substituted powdered garlic, as I didn't have fresh garlic on hand. I like curry and coconut together, but the combo of coconut, curry & tomato sauce/tomatoes was not for me. Thanks for the submission, the recipe is a hit with a lot of other people, just not with me.

I loved cooking this recipe, and I loved how it turned out! This was my first time cooking with curry, I used chicken thigh instead of breast! After getting a really good brown crispy sear on the skin I put them aside and reserved the 2tbl of the fat from the sear to make my curry paste. After getting the paste and veggies together I put the thighs back in to cook a little more and added the sauce mix and let it simmer for a little more than an hour, It was so delicious!! xoxo THANKS ROMA!!

I followed this recipe only with the exception that I had to substitute 1 Tablespoon  green curry paste for 1 Tablespoon ground curry as I only had one tablespoon ground curry. This is a great, great recipe. I put in a whole onion and my picky son didn't even notice and ate everything. The other son stated that this recipe was awesome. I will have to remember this recipe to do over and over again. It was great over brown rice.

I cut the sugar to 2 Tbsp, but otherwise kept all the sauce ingredients the same as the original recipe called for.  I used 2.75 lbs of chicken tenderloin, but only the amount of sauce for 2 lbs as written. I simmered uncovered as many reviewers suggested. From start to finish it took about an hour.  The sauce thickened beautifully and was delicious.  I loved it, and even my picky husband (who had sworn off anything made with curry) enjoyed it and said he would not object to me making it again.

Next time I'll slice my onions a teensy bit thicker and maybe use more.

Boyfriend is a very picky Eater, and he loved it. Served it with Pasta for dinner and with Rice the next day for lunch. I did tweak the recipe added allot more curry, and seasoned the hell out of my chicken, seared it and chucked it into the crock pot. Almost worth smelling curry for two days lol

OMG this is SOOOOOO good!  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil and simmered it uncovered until I liked the consistency.  Can't wait to make a vegetarian version for myself!  Love Cook Stephanie's suggestions to make the best ever curry - will try next time.

very good- but needed extra curry seasoning & salt & pepper.  careful not to use too much tomato  sauce!  with those adjustments it's 5 stars.

Huge hit with the family. Even the three year old! I added some cashews that I roasted in curry oil after simmering, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It is a new staple in this home.

Very easy and very tasty. The only thing I'd tweak is to add a bit more salt and perhaps a bit more pepper as well.

This was really good and very easy... plus, a hit with all the kids.  Though, I did change one thing.  I cut back on the sugar to 2 T as 3 seemed like too much.  Next time I will reduce it further because it was still pretty sweet.

Love this recipe! I make it a lot and here are the changes I make: I use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, they don't dry out like a chicken breast would. I only use one can of diced tomatoes, skip the sauce, and let it simmer for probably an hour; this helps the flavors blend. I also use more curry than it calls for because I love curry. This is a hit everytime I make it.

Delicious! Just needs to be simmered a little longer (and uncovered) than the recipe calls for.

Did not like the tomatoes in it and didn't taste the curry as much as I wanted. Edible, but by no means a favorite.

This is so good. I have made it so many times for company. Everyone always likes it. The only thing I do different is use coconut oil for cooking and I like a medium curry and I use stewed tomatoes I make with chilli peppers. I do so like spice. This is a keeper thanks Roma for sharing this wonderful recipe :)

This was relatively easy and my family liked it, but personally I had hoped for a bit more exotic flavor.  It's the first time I have cooked with coconut milk and I was disappointed that I couldn't taste the coconut flavor at all.

Good.  Loved coconut milk.  Used can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed (drained slightly).  Thickened sauce with cornstarch.  Added 2 carrots and a few peas.  Would b good with some spice-chili pepper

My family loves all kinds of curry from Indian, Thai to Japanese. It is a good beginner curry to try but is not getting a 5 star from me. I am very thankful to have found this recipe as we did still enjoy our dinner served with flatbread, basmati rice, samosas and chutney. In the future I will try different curry powders and pastes to see how much of a difference it makes. Very easy to prepare, by the way.

This has become a family favorite! I recommend doubling the vegetable oil and simmering uncovered to make a thicker, richer sauce.

Amazing recipe. I have made this around 5 times so I no longer measure anything out.  It is more like throw everything together and add more to taste. Tonight I am added diced pineapple to it.

I'm not a huge curry fan, but I thought I'd give it a try.  WOW!!  This was delish!  The only change I had to make was the can of stewed tomatoes since my store didn't have any (WHAT?).  So I used a can of diced tomatoes and drained the juice a bit.  I did follow the advice of some of the reviews and let it simmer UNCOVERED.  After about 45 minutes, the sauce was perfect.  Put this curry over a bed of quinoa, YUM!

You can make this VEGAN/VEGETARIAN by using a head of cauliflower in place of the chicken. I used to make this all the time before I went plant-based and now I can make it again! I just leave out the chicken and use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce so it doesn't get too runny. I let all the ingredients except cauliflower simmer for 30 minutes, then add the cut-up cauliflower and simmer another 20 minutes. It was delicious! However, I did get a stomach ache after and I think it's from the fat in the regular coconut milk. I might try lite coconut milk next time. Still, it gets 5 starts for flavor.

I did not think I would like it, I am not a huge fan of curry.  I tried it because my son talked me into it.  It is great.  I think it is a solid base recipe and other things like pineapple or broccoli can be added to make it even better.

I made this recipe but did change a few things based on the reviews. I started by making the sauce. I added the curry, onion, garlic. I added the can of light coconut milk, tomatoe sauce and the diced tomatoes. I did drain them and save the liquid for later. I covered and cooked the sauce for 20 min w the lid on. In the mean time, I cut up two chicken breasts, sprayed  the pan with oil and used 1T of curry to cook th pieces of chicken.  I added the chicken to the sauce once it was cooked and then cooked it  uncovered for 20 more min. I added a bit of the reserved tomatoe juice from the diced tomatoes (I didn't add at first because of all the reviews saying sauce didn't thicken) and cooked 20 more minutes without the lid. Served with rice and nan I liked up at the grocery. Will make again. Next time i will follow exactly but will not cover the sauce so it reduces properly. It was good and I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was actually pretty good. Not as thick as normal Thai curry that I'm use to but the flavors came out great. Served it over jasmine rice and tasted wonderful! Will definitely use again.

Very good recipe with a few modifications.  I used 300ml of tomato marinara, 250 ml of coconut milk, 2 tbsp of coconut sugar, diced one whole tomato instead of a can of diced tomatoes, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Turned out great!

Holley Moses but this was fantastic!  My husband loves curry and he said "this is gourmet"!  I mostly stuck to the base recipe, but did add some veggies and stuff. These were my changes: I took the advice of another reviewer an cooked the curry powder in the oil longer - for about 5 minutes, and I cooked the onion and garlic for about 10 minutes.  I did not use any tomato sauce, only had tomato paste. I buy it in a squeeze bag (live overseas) so I did about one turn of the pan -maybe 4 tablespoons, and used only abt half the sugar called for. Also added "a dash" of tumeric, garam masala and ground coriander seed.  I set a 20 minute timer and at that point added in a sliced carrot, 4 stalks of sliced celery, and half each of sliced red and green bell pepper.  5 min before it was done I added about half a pound of pre cooked frozen shrimp that I thawed in warm water.  Turned off the stove and just covered it and let it sit for 5.  Served with white rice cooked in the cooker, but I dissolved a chicken bullion cube into the cooking water.  Had some warm Arabic bread to go with it.  Absolutely wonderful. This one is a keeper for sure!

Loved this!  I am not really familiar with making curry so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon to the curry mixture as it cooked.  It smelled amazing and the flavor was wonderful.  I decided to simmer it uncovered for about an hour.  Served over jasmine rice.  My son dislikes curry, but he loved this dish.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Instead of chicken, I packed it with veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, Red bell pepper, zucchini, and squash)and added a little ginger and red pepper for spicyness. Yum! Fed me for three days...

Great recipe - super simple but loads of flavor. I've had difficulty in the past trying to recreate restaurant style curry bowls but not with this recipe. I used one pound chicken and one green bell pepper instead of 2 lb chicken and I added some red pepper flakes to amp up the heat. Perfect!

This turned out great!  I only used 1 1/2 pounds of chicken because I like a lot of sauce to coat the rice and veggies.  I served it with saffron rice and steamed broccoli.  Next time I might leave out the tomato sauce.  I used 3 tbsp. of curry and light coconut milk.  I will definitely be making this again!

I liked it, so did my family, and my boyfriend. Although, the next time I make it I wont be adding that much, if any sugar. I just thought it was too sweet with the 3 tablespoons of sugar. Maybe It needs 1 tbsp. Another thing. The recipe says to heat the oil in the curry powder, which was a really good thing, but you have to be quick when you mix in the onions and garlic, because Curry powder will stink up the whole house. Its been over 24 hours, and every time you walk through the house, you can still smell the curry. I really did enjoy trying this recipe, and Its definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Tried this for the first time exactly as stated, but cubed the chicken and used low fat coconut milk as suggested. Very good! I will try the curry paste NEXT time to spice it up, and plan to add more veggies--but this is a keeper.

This was awesome!  I used Mexican stewed tomatoes and a Mexican chipotle cooking sauce, instead of plain tomato sauce, which blended very well with the curry.  We will definitely make this again.

Made it exactly as per recipe. Found it a little too sweet with not enough flavour. I'll keep this recipe as a base, but will have to add more flavour. Thank you for the recipe.

I just made this for the first time and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't have to alter but a few things. I changed the amount of curry (added 1 extra tbl.) and would only add half a can of tomato sauce next time; to spice it up I added some chili pepper flakes as well. It was a great hit with friends and family, and will totally be making this again!

Great! A bit like butter chicken. Would use 1/4 can of tomato sauce or none at all; and 1 tbsp of sugar instead of 3. Also, use curry paste instead. Could only find green curry paste, but that was still fine. Yummy!

Our family loves this recipe. We couple it with a nana recipe from here and it is an awesome treat. I basically follow the recipe. I do add more garlic cause we like it, I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, I add cinnamon to taste, and use coconut oil instead of vegetable. I also use hot Madras curry powder instead of plain old curry powder. It adds a little more kick. I would recommend anyone to try it and  modify to your tastes.

I have made this twice and it is just 'meh'.  It's not the curried coconut flavor I prefer-- it's too tomato-y.

Yes!  This was awesome!  I didn't have coconut milk so I had to make it homemade using shredded coconut and boiled water.  I also found a recipe for curry brown rice and I put the curry chicken on top of it and WOW!  Very tasty!  I also put a little bit of brown sugar in it as well.  My nieces loved it as well and it is hard to get them to eat anything sometimes.  Anyways, the next time I will have to probably use less coconut milk and tomato sauce because it did come out a little runny but it was still awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.  God Bless.

This did not taste right at all. I followed the recipe as it is listed here. It had very little flavor and relied on salt being added to pull out the curry taste. It was a huge disappointment.

This was so delicious! I love this recipe! It does come out watery sometimes but I usually let it cook uncovered and if it is still too water I make a flour base to thicken it up a little more. This is a FABULOUS curry!

Fun Thai recipe. Make sure you read the helpful reviews. The first time I cut down on the curry til I knew if we liked it. Now I use the listed amount. Use good fresh curry. I bought some from the food coop and it is so much better  than canned.

If you haven't had Thai curry before, this recipe probably does produce what seems to be a runny, thin kind of curry sauce. But, in Thai cuisine, that is exactly what the curry is supposed to look like, almost like more of a soup. If you want a thicker gravy, than by all means, add a thickener, but this curry is perfect the way it is. especially if you use a Thai curry paste instead of curry powder. I also throw in carrots and potatoes, but that's just a personal preference.

I've tasted better curry before for this recipe I would add some peas for sure the next time and keep the carrots that I decided to add. Don't put the full amount of sugar to it, I did half of what was asked. I added half of what was call for the tomato sauce because putting the whole can of stew tomatoes and tomato sauce would have made it too much tomato taste. 

Would I recommend? Probably not there was nothing special about the dish after all said and done. But that's for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful.  Everyone in the family had seconds, and my little 3 year old, who eats very little at dinner, had thirds.  This one is a keeper.  I made it exactly the way it was written.

Very good and all our kids loved it.  it The second time we made it we substituted the coconut milk for coconut water and added some fresh unsweetened coconut.

Good recipe for leftover coconut milk, plus i just diced up a leftover can of whole peeled tomatoes, no tomato sauce necessary (though a dash of tomato paste could make up for the missing tomato flavor). Quick and easy.

We love this dish.  So easy, and it calls for ingredients I can and usually do keep on hand.  The thing I do differently is to add some cornstarch to the broth to thicken it up a bit.  Do this by pulling out a little broth into a separate bowl and letting it cool a little.  Then add the cornstarch and mix well before putting it back into the pot.  Then you shouldn't have clumps and it thickens it nicely.   I love to add cashews on top when serving for a little bit of a crunch.

This came out really good. I've already made it a couple times. To make it a little bit healthier, I omitted the sugar and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I served it over brown rice and it is one of the best dishes I've made in a long time.

This was decent. I wavered  between 3 and 4 stars but my husband liked it better than me so I gave it 4!  I followed the recipe exactly except I accidentally doubled the tomato sauce, using 16 oz rather than 8 oz. It was very soupy with that, so I had to add a bit of cornstarch at the end to thin it out.  It was good, in my opinion, but not GREAT. It seemed to be missing something, though I am not sure what... I think it would have been better with fresh tomatoes and other vegetables mixed in. Maybe fresh curry paste rather than powder?  Anyway, I might make it again, but I may try tweaking it a bit. 

Forgot to add that my 2 year old son, who is somewhat picky, ate a bunch of the chicken, so it was a hit with him! I like the fact that it isn't overly spicy for young children.

Love it! I used Coconut oil , added peas, and did reduce the sugar by half. Wonderful with rice and steamed cauliflower. My 7 yr. old twins loved it too and 1 said it was his favorite food. Winner!

only changes i made were to leave out the 8 ounce can of tomato sauce, drain the diced tomatoes, use a whole thinnly sliced onion, and double the curry powder.  smelled great while cooking but tasted bland... not sure what it needs to be great but seemed to be missing something.  still searching for a great curry recipe using coconut milk and curry powder.

My family liked this recipe.  My kids are not into tomato chunks, so I pureed the stewed tomatoes in a blender before adding.  I also chopped four red potatoes and two cups of chopped carrots to add with the coconut milk.  I did this because my kids eat these when found in soups.

I did not like this at all! When I cook curry chicken, I NEVER add tomatoes or tomato sauce. I don't know what got into me the day I made this. It just didn't taste right. I am used to the authentic Vietnamese curry so I will stick to that.

Very good. I didn't have canned tomatoes so I chopped three romas and added one 8oz. can of tomato sauce.  My 3 year old said she liked it and my husband who is not a chicken eater also liked it.  I will try with pork next time as one reviewer suggested.  I had a side of white rice, carrots, and broccoli.

OMG! the smell of this curry is literally making my mouth water as I type.I made exactly as written, except I only used 1 lb chicken and added potatoes and carrots in between the chicken and the coconut milk step. I also let it simmer for about 2 hours. It tastes fine before that (*I was so hungry I couldn't wait!*) But the flavors start to meld a little more the longer you cook it, the sauce condenses a little more, so I'm glad I did- esp since adding the veg gave it a little more liquid. If you want to cut back on the liquid, just partially drain the tomatoes, and use a 4 oz can of tomato sauce instead of an 8 oz can. Also- if you decide to add veg- know that carrot is going to make the curry sweeter, so cut back a bit on the sugar, and if you're going to add potatoes, you'll need to add a bit more salt, since they- and the coconut milk- tend to "suck" the flavor of the salt out of the dish. Over all, a great super easily prepared, fairly complex curry flavor with none of the struggle of finding exotic ingredients. I threw it together with what I had on hand and its DELICIOUS!

Delicious. After reading about the concerns over whether the sauce would thicken or not, I removed the lid for the last 15 minutes. The sauce still was thinner than I liked, so I added some cornstarch, and it thickened up nicely.

This was amazing! My hubby loved it, my kids (ages 5 and 8) loved it and I loved it.

I made three changes:

1). I used hot curry powder.

2). I only used half a can of stewed tomatoes and 

3). I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Amazing.

Fantastic base for dinner. I added red potatoes, sweet potatoes, two types of bell pepper, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and didn't add the tomatoes or tomato sauce. I followed other suggestions of cooking all spices in with the oil for about a minute before adding anything. Husband absolutely loved it!

I love this recipe! I have made it for several years now. I don't change a thing. Some people say it's too saucy, no it's perfect. Make it with Jasmine rice. The rice soaks up the sauce and it's wonderful. Everytime I make it people rave about it. LOVE IT!

I have made this dish many times now and still play around with it. My husband and I tend to substitute when we can other things for sugar. I added a can of pineapple chunks and left the sugar out which we very much enjoyed. I have also added baby red potatoes to other batches as per another suggestion which was wonderful. First time I made this I followed exactly (and loved it) and since have played around to our own liking. This is a must!

This is a GREAT recipe! Very tasty and on the sweet side! When I mentioned "curry" no one in the house wanted to try it but once they smelled it and gave it a taste I had nothing left over. Cook some white rice and some vegetables for the side and you can feed 6, if not this will feed 4 VERY hungry people. This is something I would expect to get at a restaurant....very good. Give it a try!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly then added cauliflower because I like vegetables but didn't think a salad would go with this. I served it over brown rice. I'll make soup with the leftovers - lots of sauce.

Easy to make in general but my suggestion would be that you let the sauce and chicken after all ingredients are in, simmer on low-med heat around an hour.  This does reduce your sauce but it thickens nicely and really makes the flavors more intense.  My kids didn't love it (we don't generally eat this style of food, I'm branching out so it was expected) but the adults seemed to like it.  I found the sugar WAS needed.  It added some punch to all the other flavors.  Served it over Jasmine rice with a side of broccoli and beer bread (from this site) and it made for a nice change up on the menu that was very hearty and filling.  I followed the recipe exactly having never made it before with no additions and it turned out very good.

My Husband loved it!  It was a little on the soupy side, but I think it was very good that way.  I served it with rice and it was the perfect consistency!

This was so tasty, even one of friends who usually doesn't like this type of food had 3 bowls. We will use more curry next time as it was about a 1 for hotness on a scale of 1 to 10.

I searched for a recipe with coconut milk and chicken, and found this. I was in a rush and didn't have all the ingredients, so I just cooked the curry in oil, added the onions and garlic, then the chicken, then fresh tomatoes, then added the coconut milk. I didn't even simmer for more than 5 minutes, then sprinkled in some cilantro near the end. Just ate it out of a bowl with nothing accompanying it and it was truly delicious. I will make it again when I have more time and follow the recipe more closely! The tomatoes were a nice tangy balance to the sweetness of the coconut milk, so I think I'll use fresh tomatoes again and not add sugar.

I made this tonight for a dinner party. It was very wasy to make, but only chicken and sauce. Next time I will add some chick peas and mushroom to make it a little heartier. I also agree with not needed all the sugar.

Followed Cook Stephanie's tips, added 1/4tsp of dried crushed Thai peppers because we like spice.  (I'll probably add a bit more next time). I used a pack of chicken drumsticks and 1 breast (all I had). Cooked in the slow cooker on low for about 5-6 hours, adding the coconut milk, tomatoes, sauce, and sugar mixture after 2 hours. The drumsticks were mighty juicy and tender, the one breast- not so much (which I expected, since breasts tend to cook faster).  Very tasty, the family loved it!

A good and easy recipe; nice for a change of pace. I don't know why people complained about the liquid - it's useful to go over the rice usually served with this. I would make again.

This is one of my regular recipes!  I make this often, and my entire family eats it... including my 6 and 3 year old :)  It doesn't have that Thai curry flavor that I thought it would, but it still tastes great!

Loved the flavor but way too runny even with little over 2 lbs. chicken and adding 1tbs. corn starch. Maybe next time will eliminate 
the liquid from stewed tomatoes. Also I simmered uncovered 1 hour ~
still too runny!! Would be 41/2 stars if this was corrected. I used the thick canned coconut milk (first pressed) but I did use splenda instead of sugar maybe that would make the difference?

This recipe is delicious and inexpensive to make. Just make sure you follow cook Stephanie's advice on cooking the curry properly. It's very easy once you get the hang of it. I double and triple this for any potlucks or gatherings, even kids love it.  I use sweet onions and ALWAYS use good quality coconut milk. Some cheap or imported cans can have a weird taste and completely ruin the dish. I use half regular and half light, and petite diced tomatoes so they don't overwhelm the dish. I like to use bone in, skinless chicken.  Simmer the whole pieces in the sauce till tender, then shred and return to the pot without the bones.  This really lets the flavor develop. Be careful if you use a crock pot because more than 3 hours will start to break down the coconut milk. Also, I don't add salt and pepper till I serve, I love to grind a little Himalayan sea salt for texture.

Texture was perfect. Sauce was like velvet on the tongue. But there was little if any flavor.
I used red curry paste and reduced portion to one tablespoon. I was worried about the heat level of the dish. It wasn't necessary. Very little heat, and my wife is not a fan of spicy foods.
I took cooking advise from Stephanie but still not much flavor.
I don't have a benchmark to compare this to. Maybe this is all there is? I will try another dish to gauge results.

My kids said this tasted like candy!  I added carrots, bell pepper, cream, red pepper, cinnamon, turmeric & ginger.  I left out the onions & salt & pepper. It is key to let the curry fuze with the oil. It was so yummy!

I made this after a craving for curry, i've never made a curry dish before, my husband and i loved this! Mine turned out a bit more red than the pictures even though i used half the amount of tomato sauce, but the taste was wonderful! I followed Stephanie's tips and cooked the curry in the oil first and then the onions. I only had mild curry powder and wantd a kick so i added a touch of cayenne and i also added maybe 1 tsp of garam masala powder, i used only 1 tbsp of sugar and lite coconut milk, served over rice cooked in chicken broth, the result was wonderful!!

Had no tomato sauce on hand, just the stewed tomatoes. Used a heaping dollop (1/8 cup?) of yellow curry paste and a tablespoon of regular powdered curry. Used 3/4 of a large vidalia onion. Cooked for about 45 min and served with jasmine rice. It was super easy and yummy. The whole house smelled like curry for two days, which I liked but some may not.

We LOVED this recipe.  There was quite a bit of liquid, so I only added half a can of tomato sauce and drained a bit of the diced tomatoes before adding them to the skillet.  It is a bit sweet. You could probably cut the sugar in half and it would be still be quite good.

Crazy good. We add a LOT of curry powder, but we use the McCormick's hot madras curry powder instead of regular curry powder. Gives it a nice kick. Use whole chicken thighs on the bone, and it adds to the flavour. Add a can or two of chickpeas also at times, and it's all good. Use all the liquid, people. It will absorb into the rice. Thanks, Roma--your recipe rocks!

Beautiful! This recipe was so perfect in every way. The only adjustments I made were adding a little chili powder ( I like food spicy) and some basil. This was plate-licking good!! My family loved it :)

I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it was wonderful. Even my 5 year old and two toddlers loved it! My husband and I added a little cayenne pepper to our own plates, but it was delicious as is too! Definitely will be making this again!

Really a wonderful basic!  It is also a great dish to build on, as long as you saute the heck out of that onion and curry paste (I prefer curry paste), you cam throw just about any protein in it.

This is so full of flavor! I use 2 TB of yellow curry and 1 TB of red curry.  I also add a head of fresh cauliflower, or a bag of frozen.  I also usually add some arrow root to thicken towards the end.

This was just OK. I made other curry once, wasn't sure which recipe I used, but turned out much better the other time. Maybe I used too much curry paste but something was just off.

I think one of the secrets to this recipe is the curry you choose to use. I chose to follow other's suggestions to "cook" the curry in oil. I used Spiced Islands Curry Powder which is very mild yet flavorful. For folks who are concerned about this dish being too spicy, this is a good choice. I used a whole onion and added one medium sweet potato thinly sliced. Rather than add sugar, I used about 1/4 cup of raisins. To make the dish vegetarian, I used Lightlife Chick'n  Style Smart Strips which I stir fried separately and added to the curry skillet about five minutes before serving. I would definitely make this again!

Another amazing dish to add to my college student cooking collection. Did not have any diced tomatoes on hand so I chopped up one tomato and added that. Also threw in an apple sliced up and gave it an additional crunch. Lasted me quite a few days thanks!

This was my first time cooking curry and it turned out great! I took the advice of another review and cooked the curry powder & oil for 5 mins, and then the onion & garlic for an additional 5 mins. This was easy to make and was FULL of flavor.. Just enough sweetness and just a touch of heat.  My palette doesn't handle heat very well and this was perfect, just a hint but not overwhelming at all- in fact my husband who handles heat well said that he didn't even taste any spicyness. The other reviews are right about your house smelling like this for 24-48 hours, but the meal turned out so well we didn't mind!

Wow! This is so good! It definitely rivals my favorite Indian restaurant in LA. It does have a bit of a tomato taste from the tomato paste, but I didn't have the full concentration of the coconut milk. I would definitely recommend. I also followed another review by cooking down my onions first. Happy Eating!!

Will cut sugar in half next time, but otherwise excellent recipe. Not spicy, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to modify. Perfect for kids though.

My fiance loved it, I wasn't as struck. I was expecting something that tasted a bit more like korma but that's my fault, if that's what I wanted that's what I should have looked up!  It was tastey, mine turned out more much red than the pictures which leads me to believe I probably did something wrong.  I made it exactly as the recipes states but cooked for much longer uncovered.  The sauce thickened up nicely and now two days later there's still a lovely sweet aroma in the air in my tiny apartment despite having had the windows up full time! lol

Really great recipe!! Followed a few suggestions and used curry paste instead of powder and cooked for a few extra minutes, also cooked onions a bit longer and used the whole onion. For vegetables I added green and red peppers at the same time as the onions and also drained the tomatoes before adding them. Simmered uncovered for about an hour and added a little cornstarch to thicken. Not being a big fan of coconut milk I was amazed by how much I enjoyed this dish and will definitely be making it again soon!

Not sure what to say about this receipe except for it was AWESOME!!!! I cook for my mother and grandmother on Sundays so I thought I would try this since they both like spicy food. I double the receipe and made the follow adjustments. I'm not a tomato person so I only used 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of stewed tomatoes. I also use 32oz of coconut milk and let it cook for an hour and a half. This was perfect!!!! Excellent receipe!!!!

tasty but a little too sweet for my family.  Could probably make without adding the sugar.  Used light coconut milk.

Very easy and tasty.  Used less chicken, but same amount of sauce.  Simmered part of the time uncovered as others suggested to speed up process.

This is one of the best chicken curry recipes that's I've found.  This will be my "go to" recipe for chicken curry.  I did add a green chili and a diced sweet potato just because I like that in chicken curry.  The sweet potato didn't change the taste of the curry, but because the potato is sweet, I omitted the sugar.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!!

Perfect Curry Chicken!

I'm a caribbean islander so I've had numerous forms of this dish since childhood but this recipe is one of my favorites. 

That wonderful curry flavor comes through with the complement of the coconut, tomatoes and onions!

Modifications/Substitutions: I used 3-4 tablespoons of ketchup instead of tomato sauce and diced 2 fresh tomatoes versus canned. I also rubbed skinless chicken thighs with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, ground thyme and ginger. And left them to marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking. Thanks for sharing this one! It's a winner!

I made quite a few changes, but feel the recipe is a good base. I used cubed breast and thigh meat, drained the tomatoes, eliminated the tomato sauce and sugar...can't imagine it with 3 Tbsp sugar!  Cooked it on med-high heat for 15-20 minutes to thicken the juices and served it over basmati rice.  Excellent.

This was absolutely delicious!!  My two teenage sons could not get enough.  Here are some minor changes I made as we like alot of flavor and spices.  I added cubed potatoes and baby peas and sauteed that with the onions and garlic (added a bit more oil to criisp up to potatoes).  I added ground cardomon, dash of cayenne (more if you like it spicy) and fresh cilantro.  You can also add chicken broth to the mix if you want.  Fantastic over basmati rice.

I added carrots and potatoes to bulk it up a bit, but it hits the spot when I'm craving curry.  I did buy mild curry paste instead of using powder, but it was too mild for me.  Next time, I'll mix the mild with the hot to get the right amount of heat.

My first foray into making curried chicken, but it won't be my last.  Hubby & I really enjoyed it.  The only mods. I made were using a bit more curry powder...I was using a mild one, so I just finished off the jar...about 2 1/2 Tbls.  I added a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes to bump up the heat, and added some frozen peas at the end, like one of my Indian friends would.  I served it over Thai Coconut Rice (http://www.cookingforseven.com/2009/04/thai-coconut-rice/).  Can't wait to make it again.

This is BY FAR the best Curry Coconut Chicken recipe that I have ever made! I always add more curry and garlic than stated. I just wanted to add another raving review for this recipe that I've used over and over and over! So good every time!

My family loved this recipe. Very easy and great taste. I did not use a sweetened coconut milk since it doesn't say to and has you add additional sugar(a must). Needs some veggies, carrots cook well in the chicken.

Oh my gosh, so good!  And so easy!  The flavor could have been a bit better because I used leftover roasted chicken thighs, but it was still a hit. Can't wait till I make it with raw chicken so it can simmer in the delicious curry!  Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe but living at a high altitude does require more fluid to start with. Also i used less tomato sauce, more coconut milk, and fresh tomato instead of canned.

Really Really Good! Followed the recipe exaclty - simmered a little longer with lid off is the only exception.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a hit!  Easy to make and delicious!  I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and cut the sugar in half and it was perfect.  The whole house smelled wonderful and when my daughter-in-law arrived, she said she could smell it outside.  It was mild and the tomatoes take it to another level.  Loved it!!!

This was wonderful! I cooked the curry in the oil with the onions and garlic for about 10 minutes. I changed it a bit by adding diced baby carrots and fresh corn cut off of the cob and I simmered everything together for about 45 minutes. We would have licked the pot if we could have!! Great recipe!!!

As one reviewer suggested, I sauteed the garlic and onions with the curry powder until they were translucent.  I then added a 28oz can of tomatoes, partially drained, and stirred until there was no more curry powder stuck to the bottom of the skillet.  I added 1.5 cans of tomatoes, the sugar, 3 cubed red potatoes, and omitted the tomato sauce.

End result: delicious!  Next time, I will add some red pepper flakes and a little more curry powder to bring it up to 5 stars

This recipe is easy to make and lasts for days. I found that the liquid didn't thicken up as much as I'd like, but it was still good. Maybe next time I'll add potatoes to make it heartier. Be prepared for your house to smell like curry for awhile though!

I follow the recipe exactly the way it is. My husband love this recipe and I think it would be pretty good if you cut back the amount of sugar. It was candy sweet to my taste (but I barely eat any sugar at all). I will try again but with only 1 tablespoon of sugar instead 3.

Great recipe! But I only added 1 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and it was perfect. 3 tablespoons would have been way to sweet for our tastes.

This curry was delicious! I used homemade coconut milk and it was a bit watery so next time I'll use store bought. I didn't have stewed tomatoes or tomato sauce so I used 22.5 oz of fresh tomatoes instead and boiled them for about 5 minutes to remove the skin and then chopped them. I added 1 tablespoon of ketchup to make up for the lack of tomato paste. I also upped the salt a bit. It was nothing short of spectacular!

Made this pretty close to the way it is written except that I forgot to salt and pepper the chicken.  Didn't miss it. I used light coconut milk.  I used curry powder purchased from an Indian grocery store. I cut up the tomotoes. I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar and it was still slightly sweeter than I liked, but my family loved the sweetness. I didn't have time for it to simmer for 40 min.  I simmered for about 20 min., so it was a bit soupy, but we really enjoyed how it mixed with the rice.  Yummy!  This turned out delicious and even my picky teenage daughter ate seconds. Will make again, for sure!

We loved this recipe!  It was my first try at making my own curry and it did not dissapoint!  I used light coconut milk because it was what we haditg.  Have to say I am glad I did.  We like curry to not be so sweet and I think the regular sweet coconut milk would have been to much for us.  We did add more curry powder about a half tablespoon more.  I would have added another tablespoon or two, but I wanted the kids to eat it also.  This is definitely a curry recipe that the kids will eat right up!  Will be adding this one to the permanent rotation.

My family loved this recipe from the very first time I made it. After making it the first as written, I did take the advice of Cook Stephanie and cooked the curry for 5 minutes, the onion for 10, and then add the tomatoes. I accidentally used cream of coconut once, and it worked well, but it was very sweet. Just omit/cut back on the sugar if this happens. The flavor of the coconut milk helps temper the flavor of the curry for those who are not so fond of curry. This is a keeper!

This is really good! I usually add some ground ginger and chilli flakes to bring out the flavor a little more. I make this a lot because my husband loves it and so do my guests.

Great basis for a coconut curry chicken recipe. 

Of course, like everyone else has commented, it is to taste and I made the following changes

5 tbsp curry (3 wasn't enough)
more oil
red pepper flakes
more sugar (it's a thai recipe - it's supposed to be sweet!)
chopped peanuts
served over coconut jasmine rice 

And, I let simmer for about 2 hours mostly covered. 

great base, though. Thank you for posting!

This was my first time making an official 'curry' dish. It was very good. I was worried for a minute when I tasted it and it was.. meh... then I realized I'd left out the sugar! That made all the difference. Will make this again many times I expect.

Excellent dish! Used 4 fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned ones(yuck!). This tastes fresh and has just the right amount of seasonings. This I will be making weekly! I will try it in a crock pot next with some red potatoes, since it is a little bit soupy.

Really good and easy recipe.  I read all the reviews and followed several alterations.  I used curry paste instead of powder and cooked for 5 minutes before adding the onion and garlic.  I cooked the onion and garlic for 10 minutes.  I used more oil.  I added jalepenos and I added some cumin, tarragon and basil.  Next time I'll add red and green peppers and potatoes.

This dish is soooooo good! I used Lite Coconut milk, fire roasted tomatoes, and half spicy curry powder and half mild so it had a little kick but was not overwhelming. I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I have never made anything with curry in it.  Great recipe to make if you have never made a dish with curry!  I followed "cook Stephanie's" advice in her review. It turned out great!

We just returned from the Middle East and I wanted to replicate a dinner from our trip.  I was originally concerned the coconut milk would over take the flavor in this dish, but it was fantastic!!!!  My husband loved it and said it is by FAR the best curry dish he has had, even with all the food we had in the Middle East.  The key is to cook the curry in the oil not just dump it in the recipe. This is how they do it in real Middle Eastern cooking. This is a real winner!

You cannot go wrong with this recipe! Everyone I've ever served this to has enjoyed it, even people who don't normally like curry. Also, I once messed up the ingredient quantities and it still tasted great! I cannot rave enough about this - it's easy to make and tastes wonderful! I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could!

added one extra tbls of curry and1 tsp of ground red pepper for some extra heat.   
1/2 cup of peas at the end of the simmer to make it pretty.  
used 1 tbls corn starch to thicken before serving.
i used a very thick and sweet coconut milk so i'll cut the sugar in half next time.

This was SO delicious!  My husband loved it & our very picky 8-year old had seconds, then thirds!  I only used 2 chicken breast halves but made it exactly as written other than that.  It was saucy and perfect.  This is definitely going into the recipe box!

Excellent recipe. I make several times a month for my family and they always love it. I use McCormick Red Curry powder and it seems to work well. My Thai friend said it's similar to something she would make for her family.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did a couple of different things...added two tablespoons of lime juice, two tablespoons of brown sugar, used fresh tomatoes (as suggested in one review), and used two big tablespoons of concentrated tomato paste instead of the can of tomato sauce. Yummy!

I am giving it 5 stars based off the changes I made per some of the reviews I read.  The few changes I made were to add 3.5TBS curry powder (I probably could have gotten away with 4TBS).  I also added carrots, potatoes & red bell pepper. I simmered for 1hr (the longer the better).  Served this over Basmati Rice... MMMMmm!  The leftovers were even better today for lunch!  I will make it again.  My 14 month old even gobbled it up :-)

This was so yummy! I will make it again!  I didn't add the sugar as I have removed sugar from my diet. I also used a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste and about 8 oz of crushed tomotoes instead of tomato sauce! I served it over spaghetti squach, fried mushrooms, cooked carrots and sweet potatoes...it was so good! Thanks for posting it ROMA!

SOOOO Good!! I could eat this several times a week.  If the sauce is a little soupy, add a little corn starch, but that would be one of the only things I would do.  Also, the review by Cook Stephanie was really helpful:  she said to sautee the  onions in the oil and curry until the onions were well cooked... this was great.

Made this last night and it came out great! I will definitely make it again since my hubby kept raving about it. I added a couple extra things; fresh cilantro (more of a garnish) and cayenne pepper to increase the spicy level.

This recipe as written had too much tomato flavor for my taste.  Next time i'll only use the stewed tomatoes and no tomato sauce.  I added green and red peppers the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Excellent recipe. This is my first attempt to make this dish and it came out wonderfully. I did modify to add an extra TBSP of curry -- otherwise I stayed with the original. Served with Basmati rice. 

Thank You for sharing this recipe and for all the added tips!

Love, love, love this recipe! Have made it nearly a dozen times & it has turned out great every time. I have used basic McCormicks curry seasoning all the way up to some really top-notch stuff, & it has alwasy been great. I tried low-fat coconut milk once, but it seemed too thin. I usually let it simmer for a good half hour then dump in some red bell pepper chunks & let it go another 15 mins. I serve it over brown rice & it is always a hit.

It was good and smelled great! I made some adjustments. I forgot to buy tomatoe sauce so I didn't add that but I forgot to adjust the sugar so mine came out a little sweet. No ones fault but my own. I did add 2 potatoes cut in cubes at the end when simmering. Next time, I would add carrots and some mushrooms. Overall, a great recipe. Will make it again and again.

This has become one of my favorite meals. Served with either rice noodles or jasmine rice and you cannot go wrong. I've used coconut milk and a couple of times even refrigerated cream of coconut. Also, I use red curry paste instead of curry powder, but have gone the curry power route as well and the results were just as good. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was sooooo good!  Those who said the sauce was too runny are CRAZY!!!!  They probably just didn't use two pounds of chicken like the recipe said. And if they use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, that will thicken it right up.  I halfed the recipe, using 3 chicken breasts, simmered covered for about 40 minutes, and PERFECT!! I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed I served with homemade fried rice with veggies in it, and the fried rice made it even better if that is possible.  Plain rice would be good also.  I know this recipe would also be amazing with beef instead of chicken, so I plan on trying that some time, and simmering for a lot longer to make the beef tender, so I will most likely up the sauce due to the simmering time, and the liquid loss.  

This recipe does not need to be altered, it's perfect the way it is!

This is my first time ever commenting on a food website, and for good reason.

It's after midnight here and I just got up to the fridge to polish off the leftovers of this meal that I made earlier today. 
 
A+ for an enjoyable meal... to make and eat both.  Simple and delicious... perfect.  

My 5 and 3 year old sons reluctantly tasted the chicken and liked it so much that they want to go back to an Indian restaurant here in the area to compare theirs to ours.  Kids liking Indian food... fantastic.

Bravo Chef Roma!

This recipe is delicious! I have never made curry anything before but was very successful with this dish! I followed the comments below and cooked the onion until it was translucent and simmered the mix with the pot uncovered (still took around 45 minutes to thicken). The only thing I could improve on is not cooking the chicken as long as I did before adding the coconut milk, tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes. Some pieces were a bit chewy, which I think is due to my overcooking the chicken initially. I will definitely make this again!

This is an excellent curry dish!!  Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it... I made a couple of changes though. I wouldn't add any sugar to this recipe at all... it makes it too sweet in my opinion. We like a bit of heat in our food as well so I minced 3 dried red chilli peppers and added them. I also substituted chicken for turkey as I had a turkey breast that had to be cooked and it held up really well in this dish.

SO easy and SO tasty!!  We did omit the sugar and added some prebaked (leftover) sweet potatoes to the pot and it was delicious!  This will be a staple dinner in our house.

Fantastic and quick. I like to drain the can of tomatoes before I add it to the mix, to ensure the right viscosity.

We added more milk and doubled the spices to make a soup.We also added mushrooms and broccoli. This recipe really tastes like a fine dining entree. Very clean tasting.

We had company over and made this for them. Some of the company tends to be picky, none had had curry before. They loved this recipe. Will be making it again.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Only made a few tweaks: I cooked the onion (and added scallions) the curry oil, as someone else had mentioned, I used fresh tomatoes and instead of sauce, I mixed some tomato paste into it. I prefer to use chicken thighs or drumsticks (I had to add a bit more salt) but when I used breasts, I brined them first and used no salt in the rest of the recipe. Truly awesome!

Awesome! I added a green bell pepper for added nutrition, I used unsweetened coconut milk and served over brown rice. I added additional salt once plated - I thought it needed it. I'll definitely make again! Even my four and one year old ate it, and we don't venture out much, culinary-wise! Other than brown rice, we served with boiled fresh green beans, tossed with sesame oil, onion powder and salt.

4.5 Stars! This is a really wonderful recipe. It was a huge hit with my husband, and it made the house smell fantastic. I'm looking forward to making it again in the near future. For my taste, it was lacking a little heat, so I added some Sriracha sauce and extra salt at the end to kick up the spiciness and it was PERFECT.

I just made this for supper and as I cooked it, I taste tested it. When I added the tomato sauce, I didn't really care for the flavor it gave the dish. It's not bad, but it took away for the coconut flavor and put more of an emphazise on the tomato. Next time I will omit the tomato sauce. Overall, a pretty tasty dish. :)

Fantastic recipe. Followed the instructions for the broth listed below and it made all the difference in the world. I opted for fresh tomatoes (a little more than a cup after they were diced) as opposed to canned tomatoes. I cooked with the tomatoes with the onions, oil, and curry and the flavor was phenomenal. I also completely left out the sugar, used lite coconut milk, and put it over brown basmati rice. A calorie-conscious, easy, and very tasty meal!

Its great however I would use less sugar next time and I'd also use less tomato sauce. I added 2 pinches of ground ginger and also made a rue to help thicken the sauce!!

This was BY far one of the best chicken dishes I've made in a long time, thanks to your recipe!!  The only issue I came across was having too much "juice" in the skillet that kept pouring over.  I just poured some of the extra into another skillet (I refused to waste ANY of it because it was so good!)...

This recipe was going great until I added the sugar, it made it overly sweet and ruined the dish. I made some adjustments but it would have been so much better without the sugar and I only added 2 tbsp not 3. Next time I will only add a tsp. I followed the modifications in the review done by Cook Stephanie and she is spot on. 

I think this recipe has great potential but needs a bit more flavor. Don't get me wrong, it is wonderful and everyone's tastes are different. Please don't give it a bad rating without tweaking it to your own tastes. 

Next time I will double if not triple the garlic, add more salt and maybe some other spices to compliment.

Roma, I could kiss you square in the mouth! This was my first time following a recipe (followed to a T) and I am so happy with the results. Recently, I had been told that my cooking was bland and I was going to order take-out for the rest of my days but alas, you have given me the delicious tools to try again. My family absolutely loved it ^_^ Wonderful recipe!

I did not have diced tomatoes so I improvised and threw in cherry tomatoes that I diced. I also used a tomato paste instead of the sauce. I left out the sugar becasue I prefer savory over sweet and would rather save on calories and this was delicious!! Only my second time making Indian food and this was so easy. Next time I will add the diced tomatoes and sauce as described. Will certainly make again!!

i tried this recipe because i had the majority of the ingredients except the tomato sauce. it turned out good. within an hour it was all gone. the sauce took forever to thicken so i added flour and turned it up really high and after 2 hours it was an ok thickness. i would recommend this. i tried it and would try it again

Not sure if just me and made it incorrectly but the tomato and coconut is a weird combination! I love Curry and Coconut flavor but not this one. Edible but not something I'd make again.

I have made this recipe many times and my family loves it.  I tried it with hot curry and sweet curry and it comes it really good each time.  The recipe is simple and I can cook everything in one pot.  I did add potatoes to mine and served it over steamed rice......perfection!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I only made a few changes. I simmered uncovered, only added 2 TBSP of pure sugar cane and added 1 cup of my favorite pasta sauce (Mom's). When the sauce needs to be thickened, I add some organic corn starch. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!

Very tasty! I halved the recipe and marinated the chicken breast for 2 hours in a mixture of:
1/2 cup plum jelly 
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
...that I blended in a food processor. 
Then I grilled the breast. I sauteed the onions/garlic/chicken/oil as described then transferred everything to the crock pot (omitting the stewed tomatoes) for 3 hours. YUM!!!

Recipe was excellent... Like others I added the cornstarch & cold water mixture to thicken it up... The only thing I did different was my own personal preference... I like potatoes with my curry chicken so I add a few diced potatoes to the mix while it is boiling... YUMMY! My husband loved it!

This was great.  It turned out that I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes at all so I just left it out and it's still fab.  I will use this as a base for sure - so easy, and I will probably try adding peas and sliced red bell peppers into it next time as well... really simple and tasty.

I was very skeptical when I saw the recipe included stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce. But it was awesome and I could not stop eating it. I followed the recipe and it was great. Next time I will try some of the ingredientes others have suggested. It was great eating in my house. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe! I cut the sugar to 1T and added 2T of heavy cream (to thicken the sauce a bit), chopped kale and garbanzo beans. Adding this to my dinner menu rotation for sure!

I think I'm in heaven!  I love going to the Bombay House, and ALWAYS order the chicken cocunut kurma.  This recipe is the closest I've ever been able to come to that (if your ordering mild, which I always do), and it's suprisingly easy to make!  I did add 1/4 c. tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce, though, because I usually don't have tomato sauce in my pantry.  No problem with thickening at all. For those not familiar, you can find coconut milk in the Asian section of your local supermarket or at any Asian Market. Amazing recipe!!!!  Yummy, yummy!

It was my first attempt in making curry. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious. 
Next time I think I'll try adding some vegetables e.g. peppers.

This was a very tasty dish. i used organic tomato passata and tomato paste instead of diced tomatoes. I also added some dessicated coconut and my sauce thickened very quickly (~15 mins). I was really suprised because many reviews mention hours of cooking.

There is way too much sugar in this dish, i like sweet but even tho I used unsweetened coconut milk I think half the sugar would be plenty.

Last but not least- this dish tastes very much like Patak's Korma which I like a lot.

I've loved this since the first time I made it! Anyone who has eaten it loves it as well! Even the people in my life who say, "Oh I don't like curry" or "Coconut? Eww!" love it as well.  I did follow some of the reviews.. like letting it simmer for an hour and not draining the juice from the diced tomatoes.  Recently I even made it with coconut cream, instead of coconut milk, and it gave it a much richer flavor.  I definitely think if you've never tried curry, or you have never liked it, this is a good starter recipe... Give it a shot!

I substituted virgin coconut oil for the vegetable oil. DELICIOUS!! Also, I didn't add any sugar. The taste was wonderful without the added carbs/calories. This is going into regular rotation- whole family loved it! Made it with the coconut rice recipe on this site.

This makes a quick weeknight dinner. For some reason I felt like it should've had more of a kick. It was a surprisingly mellow flavor. There was way too much sauce and it was very runny. I think perhaps leaving the lid off during the simmer stage would've helped. 

I also added fresh broccoli part way through cooking and while it didn't feel authentic to the dish, it was  good way to get my kiddos to eat some extra veggies.

Very good.  My Mods-- In my opinion it needs more curry.  Also needs a spicier curry added as a pinch to bring up the heat for the spice lovers like myself.  Dish was very good but too sweet and not spicy enough.  Next time I will be adding additional curry as well as a pinch of hot hot curry and possibly a little fresh ginger.

My family enjoyed this recipe; though we all agreed it was a tad sweeter than what we had in mind.  I used unsweetened coconut milk (the only kind I could find at the market)and ended up throwing in more curry, some red pepper flakes, a bit of chili powder, and a dash of cinammon.  I will make again, though I will perhaps use less coconut milk and sugar than the recipe calls for.

AH-mazing!  Absolutely delicious.  Kind of reminds me of butter chicken from my favorite Indian restaurant!  I just used more curry to make it taste a little more liek i wanted.  Adding to favorites now!

YUM!!  I'm a total novice when it comes to making something "fancy" like this.  However, this turned out very well for me :)   Unfortunately, I did manage to burn the curry on my first try -- 'special', I know.  I did find the sauce to be a bit runny, but I just added a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also added a little cayenne pepper, but only because I like really spicy food.

Delicious!  Will be making this again!

This recipe is a great base for curried chicken! I'm on a paleo diet so I left out the sugar and I don't think it hurt the dish at all. I also used half a can of tomato paste instead of a can of tomato sauce and added a red bell pepper and zuccini and a little cyan and chili powder for kick.
Will certainly be making this again.

Excellent dish.  I forgot to add the tomato sauce - but think it would have been too tangy with it.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it and there was enough left over for lunch the following day.

Made with pearl onions halved, light coconut milk and splenda instead of sugar.  My whole family loved this!  But next time I will leave out the sugar altogether.  It's an amazing dish, but will work better for me slightly less sweet!

Other curry recipes I've seen are really complicated. This one was incredibly simple. It took me about an hour and a half to prepare, and my household loved it. In fact, my roommate graciously told me I was allowed to make it any time I wanted. :p

I really liked this meal yet feel it is a little bland as written.  I took the advise of one of the reviewers and added 1 tablespoon of curry and a little cinnamon.  My husband likes his meals mild so I didn't add chili powder.  This dish is easy to make and I will make this again.

Drain the stewed tomatoes. Make on a day when you can open the windows because the spice can stick up the house.

Enjoyed this recipe very much.  Give it a chance to reduce for certain.  Maybe back off some of the tomato paste, kick up the curry by another teaspoon, add some red pepper flakes and set it off with a handful of golden raisins.  Excellent!

This isn`t my FAVORITE curry dish as it lacks some the depth of flavour.  However, it is still one we will save and make again as it is an easy to make and nicely mild dish that we found to be very family friendly.  Our 2 and 4 year old both gave their compliments to the chef.

Fantastic Curry.  I made this for my wife (she loves Curry) I've always found it, at best, so-so.  I made this recipe using a Penzey's spices Hot Curry mix, and it was terrific.  First Curry I've ever loved.  Thanks for posting!

Love it! We found it a little sweet, so next time I'll use less sugar.

Absolutely fantastic! Made a few changes that really rounded out the recipe to make a delicious sweet, filling curry. Added 1 can of crushed pineapple (drained) and used a 28oz can of tomatoes (drained_). I used 8oz tomato paste instead of sauce to reduce the amount of liquid. Turned out amazing, brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it!

Very good.  I started this in a skillet and then cooked it in the crockpot.  I had a whole chicken that I cut into pieces.  I used tomato sauce because that's what I had, and fresh coconut milk.  I can't wait to make this again and use the cut up chicken breasts.  The sauce this made was fabulous over rice.

This was my first attempt at making Indian, and I'd say it was a success.  We expected the curry sauce to be spicier but found that the coconut milk made it sweeter than anticipated.  Not difficult to throw together, and good taste.  Great with Naan, which I found on this site.  My husband is not an adventurous eater so I was happy that he went back for seconds and ate leftovers the next day.

Amazing! Tastes just like (or better!) than our favorite Indian restaurants. Just a note, I used the unsweetened coconut milk and it tasted great.  I think the sweetened would be too sweet for our liking.

Absolutely delicious! My family loved this dish. I did make some changes to the recipe - left out the tomato sauce and used only about 1 tsp of sugar. We had it with jasmine rice and steamed bok choi. Definitely a recipe that's here to stay.

Made this for the first time.  Delicious recipe, defiantly a keeper!  *note* I followed advice to have patience, take a few minutes to cook the spices in oil when beginning.  This really brings out the flavors which infuse the dish! Serve over rice, YUMMY!

Excellent dish!  I agree with other reviewers...it takes much longer than 30 to 40 minutes to thicken. I think I simmered for about an hour and a half.  In the last 15 minutes of simmering I added half of a fresh chopped pineapple and used any juices.  I did this instead of adding sugar.

I tried this but made some changes. I did not use the diced tomatoes or the tomato sauce, plus reduced sugar to 1 tsp only. Instead, I used garlic paste (1 heaped tsp), 1 tsp ginger paste and first fried those with the onions. in reduced the curry powder but added some extra cumin powder and some red chili powder to give some kick. And once the chicken was added, I put lots of veggies in to make it even more nutritious - 1 green pepper, 1 thinly sliced sweet potato, a few baby carrots and 1 zuccini.  Ended with fresh cilantro leaves. YUM!

This recipe was really good. I followed a lot of what the reviewers were saying regarding adding potato, carrots, chick peas and peas. I also let it simmer for about an hour, adding cornstarch for thickness and a little more curry powder, salt and pepper for season. Enjoyed it with a bowl of rice and will be eating left overs for dinner....LOVED IT!

Made this tonight and really enjoyed it. I wish I'd read more reviewers comments first so I'd have been prepared for how thin this stayed. Added a cup of snow peas for a yummy green. Hubby didn't like the tomatoes in his curry, but we'll definitely be modifying this for future meals. Thanks!

I followed exactly the recipe except that I substituted 1 can of tomato sauce with 4 tablespoons of tomato paste and the curry just turned out a disaster :( It tasted more like tomato soaked chicken. How can I improve this recipe? 1 can of tomato sauce seems to be the main factor.

I've never made indian food before, but wanted some of the curried chicken I've had in restaurants.  I tried this recipe and was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out!  Like one of the reviewers suggested, I cooked the curry power and oil on low for about 5 minutes.  I then added the onions and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Afterwards, I added the remaining ingredients and simmered until the sauce thickened.  Both my husband and I LOVED it!  Thank you!

Great! I only added some red pepper flake as someone else suggested, otherwise this is a great recipe! Thickens nicely on its own and there is no need to change anything in the recipe.. unless you want the added heat from the red pepper. Will be making it again!

I loved it!!!!!! I added a little ground cumin, carrot strips, and red pepper flakes just to personalize it to fit my preferences. The recipe was easy to follow and simple to make! I'm definitely going to be making this again! my only problem with it is that I and the entire house will be smelling like curry for the next few days!

This is a great recipe!  It's become a hit in our house and even the kids will eat it.  The only change I make is to double the recipe and add a few tablespoons of Patak's Mild Curry Paste and saute this for at least five minutes with the garlic, onion and curry powder.  This has lots of flavour without being spicy. I've experimented with adding different vegetables and find that it's best to add carrots and peppers once the chicken is almost done, then add your liquids and simmer.  I also add green beans but they need to be pre-cooked ahead or use canned (which I'll note I NEVER use canned anything but with this recipe it worked out great and was fast). Some chopped cilantro on top is a nice addition of you have it.  Serve over basmati rice with a side of naan and you'll be dishing up seconds for everyone.  Thanks!

This recipes was wonderful. I had some friends over and I made this and they loved it. I made some changes to the recipe. I added a large can of diced tomatoes and 3 tbs. of tomato paste. I also added 4 tbs of curry powder (and followed the suggestion of making the curry oil first). This was an awesome dish and it is great served with basmati rice and lentils! Thanks Roma for the recipe.

Didn't use the the 8oz can of tomato sauce only use about 4 oz. and only 2 tablespoons of sugar. Also El Paso green chile 6 oz. and added some dice potatoes more curry, garlic and add a little cumin. Umm Umm good!

It is good, but it is missing something...I followed the recipe exactly and it has good flavor, but it doesn't "pop" as much as this type of meal from a restaurant.  It feels like it is missing a spice, or maybe needs more curry?? I am going to start experimenting with it as I enjoy curry so I will make it more often.

I left out the sugar and still found it a bit sweeter than I prefer.  Didn't like the addition of tomatoes.  I'll stick with Michelle's recipe.

I've never made anything with curry in it before, but this was a nice place to start. I was a little nervous when I saw how much curry powder was used, but I think the coconut milk helped to tone it down some. I also wish that the sauce was thicker, and I can see from reading some other reviews, that there are some helpful suggestions on how to solve this problem. I will probably make this again, my husband loved it, and even our 15 month old did too--surprisingly since he is in his picky stage. :) Next time I make this, I'm going to make the sauce thicker and add some cashews like another reviewer did.

Add 2 more cloves of garlic (2 tsp minced) and season the chicken with way more salt because it just wasn't salty enough for me and husband's preference. I used 4 boneless skinless breasts (dunno if it was 2 lbs or not) and I had to up the oil to more like 2 1/2 - 3 T. Also, I would heat the oil and curry powder over medium next time, not medium high, because the curry almost burned. I'd also just use a large chopped fresh tomato instead of the canned stewed tomatoes next time. I did have to add a bit of cornstarch to it at the last minute to thicken it up a bit to my preference. Good over white rice cooked with a bit of butter! *edit* this tastes even better the next day!

A bit bland for our tastes. Tasted more like chicken and tomato soup. I'll try it one more time and add some garam masala and see what happens.

This is a very easy and good recipe. I didn't change a thing. I think it's important to just quickly sear the chicken in the pan because it can verge on overcooking it with the additonal 30 minutes. Makes alot of sauce, which next time I will cook down a bit (taking chicken out). Made it with basmati rice. Everyone liked it. Will make again.

Excellent base recipe for curried chicken.  Very easy to make and so flavorful.  One thing that I instantly changed about it was to add 1 sliced onion after cooking the curry for about 5 minutes.  I'm not sure what this recipe would taste like without the onions.  I do use lite coconut milk which is still very good minus the calories and for extra flavor I add a handful of coconut flakes when it's almost done.  You can throw any kind of vegetables in this recipe.  Just be careful with how much tomato you add because it can really ruin this dish.  I add 1 can of diced tomatoes when I'm in a hurry, but normally I cut up 1 big ones and I find that it's enough.  I find that it does taste better when you add some kind of starch(I usually do 1 small potato)  to thicken the sauce.  Overal an excellent recipe that opened me up to curry.

I loved this idea!! I made a couple of changes for my taste. I used 3 tbsp of curry, 1/2 tbsp of cumin, 1/4 tbsp of black pepper and 1/4 tbsp of chili powder. I also used potatoes rather than tomatoes. AMAZING. Thanks for the great recipe.

Smells and looks delicious so far!!! Only things I did differently are: Rotel HOT diced tomatoes instead of regular diced and stewed, I also used coconut cream instead of milk because it is all I had on hand, and I added three small diced red potatoes and a can of corn nib-lets after the chicken was done. Also I was out of garlic so I subbed two tbs garlic powder seems to have done the trick. Everything else I followed to the T. It smells amazing and I'm serving it with brown garlic rice and Texas toast with cheese and garlic on it. :) very excited. :) Thank you!

Very good! I always end up having friends find out we had this for dinner and they were not invited... needless to say they can get quite upset. The only thing I add is 2 tablespoons of Garam Masala and 1/4 cup of honey.

I fed an army of college men who said it was "the best they've ever had!"  Because of the quantity, I baked the chicken off early almost completely cooked with salt/pepper/chinese 5 spice.  Made the "Asian Coconut Rice" found here, adding cilantro and a little bit of fresh squeezed lime.  Combined chicken with curry and let simmer while stir frying veggies.  Served with bean sprouts for topping.  First time making curry, so thanks to your recipe, I was the hero of the night.

We love this recipe!  We made it vegetarian by using Morningstar Farms Meal Starter Chik'n Strips, or Mun Cha'i Yah(mock duck) and doubling the sauce.  I used Shan curry mix, and omitted salt, as the Shan mix has salt-a-plenty! I used frozen from fresh tomatoes as well. Thank you for posting this!

I have a diabetic boyfriend who is a finicky eater, loathing both tomatos and 'mushy textured food' as he calls it. With all of that to contend with I can say that this dish was a HUGE success!   I modified it in a few ways by using curry paste and about 1/8 cup of olive oil to coat the chicken. I also subbed the sugar for Splenda.  30 minutes prior to taking it off the heat, I threw in some fresh green beans for some color and crunch & at 5 minute prior, I tossed in some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I served it on a bed of Near East brand Rice Pilaf with some lightly boiled yams coated with cinnamon and sprinkled some coconut flakes on top of the dish for grins.   After picking out the stewed tomatos, the boyfriend was thrilled about the dish! We also noticed it didn't throw his blood sugar levels off terribly. This recipe is definitely being committed to memory!

Excellent curry. Only extra thing I added was a little red pepper flake for some bite, and the sauce ended up being so yummy!!! Great with chicken or tofu.  You must make this curry!

LOVED this recipie.  Went witht he 1lb cubed pork instead of chicken and cashews as suggested by another user.  Delicious!  Added potato (cubed), chopped carrots, and some cabbage.  Will definitely be making this again!

Loved this!  (Four stars only because I like hotter food and this was very mild...my kids would give it a full five!)  I didn't have any problem with the sauce not thickening, but that may be because I left out the tomatoes and didn't have tomato sauce, so I added enough water to 6 oz tomato paste to make 1.5 cups.  It was very thick!  Could also use a pinch more of salt -- the coconut milk and added sugar made it sweeter than I expected. Overall, will certainly make again!  I served it with jasmine rice and tandoori naan.

Fantastic recipe.  This was a huge hit in my household tonight. It reminds me of the pre-made simmer sauces at the store, only better.  I followed what other reviewers had said: let the curry heat with the oil for closer to 10 minutes, and let the whole mixture simmer, uncovered, for an hour.  Sauce thickened up great.  Added some potato when I added the liquids, and it was a delicious addition.  Putt in a little extra curry powder and a tiny bit of cayenne, but would add more next time to increase the heat a bit.  Overall extremely satisfied and happy to have tried this.

I thought it was good but not what I expected. My husband felt the same because he prefers a spicy curry opposed to the sweet. Not sure if I will make again.

I just got finished making this dish and thought it came out great. While the chicken was coating in one pan I coated 4 sliced carrots and 3 sliced potatoes in another pan with the same amount of oil and curry, when it was time to add the coconut milk and other ingredients I just combined them all. So I basically just added carrots and potatoes. I was a little worried that the added curry from the extra veges would overpower the dish, I really liked it though.

This was really very good. A delicious, easy recipe for even those first venturing into the wonders of curry. I took the advice of one reviewer and cooked the spices in the oil first, then adding the onion and so forth from there. It really made all the difference. If the original reicpe had this in the cooking instructions, I would have given it 5 stars. I doubled the recipe so my husband and i could have left overs. Curry always tastes better the next day, and this recipe was no exception. We ate ours served over steamed jasmine rice. Very yummy!!

Just had a dinner party at a friends place and this dish was a real hit. I ended up using organic diced tomatoes,  plus tomato paste in place of the stewed and sauce versions listed. Also used yellow curry paste (use at least 2-3 teaspoons which made a big difference).

An amazing recipe that will go straight into my rotation for dinners. So easy to make and amazingly yummy. My two year old practically inhaled it! My husband loved the coconut flavor! And, I loved everything about it! I made it as written, but simmered it uncovered. Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely taste and delicious! Followed others advice and added more than 2 tablespoons of curry powder and added potatoes! I am a vegetarian so I substituted the chicken and added chicken flavor bouillon. Love it very much and will definitely be making it again!

Tasted exactly like what I was craving!  We don't have any indian food places where I'm at and this hit the spot perfectly.  Delicious!  I added some dried oriental pepper for some spice, some yogurt, and stirfry veggies.  Just perfect.

This was pretty good and easy to make.  The sauce didn't thicken as I would have hoped, even after simmering for over an hour :(  But good flavor, I did add quite a bit of cayenne pepper to help with the spice since I like it really spicy.

LOVE!  I omitted the stewed tomatoes simply because I didn't have any.  Also didn't add sugar because it seemed that the coconut milk would add plenty of sweetness.  Added 3 diced potatoes to add some bulk.  The whole family raved - even my 2 year old chowed down!  I'll make it this way from now on.......

i added extra garlic (of course :D) and about 2-3 cups diced potatoes.  I cooked the curry powder & the oil a little longer than the 2 minutes--one blogger said the longer the curry & oil cook the better. I tried for 10 minutes but probably only for 5 since it smoked alot even on low (used olive oil). I used 16 oz can stewed tomatoes and about 4 oz left over pizza sauce and 1 cup coconut milk mixed from powder mix.  I'll add more after it's cooked!

This recipes was pretty good, but I think that it had too much of a tomato taste.  I think next time I will add only the tomato sauce or only the diced tomatoes.  Also, I did not add the sugar, and I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I would have liked having this taste sweet.  I used 2 tablespoons of curry paste instead, and also addes red chili powder to taste, since I like my food very spicy.  I also added green bell peppers, to add some veggies in, and used lite coconut milk.

This was my first time cooking with curry powder - I definitely agree with the other reviews that this is a great recipe to start out with!!  I was easy and delicious.  No need to make a fancy rice with this, the sauce is incredible to just put over top.  I use the lite coconut milk and really liked it.  Had to simmer for about 50-55 minutes to get the right thickness.  Awesome!  My condo still smells like curry though... 4 days later :)

This was delicious! Next time, I'll only use 1/3 of the sugar as it was pretty sweet. I'll also add some vegetables like potatoes, carrots, & bell peppers. But, overall, it was very good and very easy to make!

Very tasty and easy dish.  Loads of flavor -- I really enjoyed the way the curry, coconut milk and tomatoes all melded together.  It also reheats quite well.

This dish was amazing. I go to the local thai place on Fridays for their Curry special. When I saw this recipe I was really hoping it would satisfy my craving for the Curry I have grown to love, and know what?!?!?!? This recipe did just! The only change i made was I added an extra 2 tbsp of Curry powder while the dish was simmering. I like a bold Curry flavor and it needed the extra"kick" from added seasoning. This is going to become one of my favorites and fast!!!!!

This was my first attempt at making curry, and I loved it. I used fresh tomatoes and did not have any tomato sauce so I used a little bit of condensed tomato soup and it still turned out great.

I have given this recipe 3 stars, but am going to keep it for future references. The recipe itself is not too bad. I liked the sauce, but glad that have followed other readers advice and have added some cauliflower for crispiness. Also I only put 1 spoon of curry, as my 5 year old might found it too hot. I will do it again, whenever need variety.

This recipe is delicious!!!  I made it tonight and can't wait to eat.  I did add a little more seasonings to my chicken prior to cooking.  I also added half of a bell pepper to the saute and I am also thinking the next I will add fresh thyme to the dish while it simmers.  Good good good....

This was a wonderful, flavorful recipe! I'm not much of a cook so I pretty much followed it to the tee (except I added some chopped cashews for extra crunchiness).  I made this for dinner and had people over and it was a hit.  I was hoping there would be some leftovers but everyone had seconds!!  Will definately become a staple recipe in my book :)  Thank you!

Great recipe!!! I followed the recipe as is and it came out great! Served with rice and my husband loved it so much that he had two heaping bowls.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used the whole onion, and simmered without a lid.  I liked how easy this was to prepare, and overall the flavor was good.  However it was too sweet; next time I'll only use one tablespoon of sugar.  Plus the flavor was a bit one-note.  Next time I'll increase the garlic and add some fresh ginger.  Plus some veggies would be nice in this, maybe some red pepper, or potato.  A good base recipe though.

Amazing!  I made my dish with an extra can of coco milk, extra curry (paste), fresh tomatoes and I even added chunks of carrots and red potatoes!   DIVINE!

I never review anything but this was so good I had to write about it.  It was awesome!  New dish added to the weekly rotation.  The only thing I did different was simmer uncovered.  Seriously foolproof

I thought the recipe was excellent. I read other reviews first and didn't use all of the liquid (drained tomatoes and only used a little over half of the tomator sauce) and it was great. I added quite a bit of pepper flakes and cayenne pepper for spiciness though. VERY easy recipe to follow. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I used about 1-1/2 lbs of chicken legs, skin removed.  Omitted the sugar because I prefer a savory curry, and left out the tomato sauce because I forgot it! Topped it off with cilantro :)  Really delicious comfort food..would like to make it spicy next time with a Thai chili or maybe crushed red pepper.

This is a really superb meal. I used whole chicken thighs and legs with the skin which I chopped up into chunks. I also added quartered red bliss potatoes and whole carrots cubed.  Also to thicken it up a little bit more I added breadcrumbs which thickens the consistency at the end. The taste is really smooth and again the base recipe is superb. So Kudos to Roma!!!!

I thought it was good. Not great like the reviews gave it. It was ENTIRELY too sweet as directed by the recipe. I would try again and add more salt, less sugar and more spice.

This was delicious. It would be 5 stars if it was a bit more spicy I added extra hot curry and it still wasn't quite spicy enough for me.

This is an excellent dish!  A few tweeks in the recipe is needed to get a better sauce. 1. Making the curry oil/paste for about 5 minutes instead of 2 2. Make sure you use UNSEASONed diced tomatoes.  I accidently used italian seasoned tomatoes and my sauce tasted more "cacciatore" than "curry". 3. cook UNCOVERED stirring occasionally for 30-45 minutes until desidered thickness is achieved.  It will get thicker. 4.  Add more curry powder or even better CAYENNE pepper (~2-3 Tbsp) to the dish for more spice!

Update: I have now doubled the curry and garlic, didn't add sugar and used one can of stewed tomatoes drained and one not drained. This was wonderful! Didn't change a thing except for letting the curry cook a little longer (as suggested) before putting in the onions and garlic. Wonderful taste! Served with Caribbean rice from Zat's and made nan bread.

I used the recipe as a launch pad for recreating a restaurant favorite of mine. Added 1 tbsp of minced fresh ginger to the onion/garlic saute, and tossed in a canned of pinapple chunks (drained) and a finely diced red pepper. Was very good, although mild, I may double the curry next time but I like spicey. :)

It smelled promising, but ultimately had no flavor.  Which was quite surprising given the strength of the curry smell and the amount of spice added.  I followed the directions completely.  The problem was the sheer amount of liquid added.  It was too much for the recipe and drowned out the flavor.

followed recipe exactly, except cooked oil with curry powder and onions longer than suggested (about 5 min with curry power alone and 15 min with add'n of onions, as another reviewer suggested), and added tomatoes immediately after, before chicken. used 3 fresh tomatoes instead of canned. it was delicious. will make again. Went well with rice I flavored with cardamom and turmeric (see recipe for saffron rice, but feel free to experiment with spices and flavors you like). and naan bread.

This was a great recipe.  I use the light coconut milk available at Trader Joe's to help cut down the fat and calories.  Others have mentioned letting the curry "cook" in the oil initially with the garlic and oil - I have to agree that this step is key.  After that I stir in the onion - I used more than one onion and cut it up into a chunky dice in lieu of the slices.  I also added green bell pepper and carrots.  I also think it would be good with potatoes.  We did end up thickening the sauce with a corn starch slurry as well, but the recipe itself is delish!

This recipe made for a great curry! We used tomato paste instead of sauce and cut down on the amount of curry powder for a sweeter taste, but next time I will make just as instructed. Thanks for a simple yet delicious recipe!

Wonderful- really just fantastic!!  I added about a third of the amount of sugar it called for, used only 2 chicken breasts (but the same amount of sauce), and used hot curry paste instead of powder.  I also followed anther's advice to let the curry paste cook in the oil for 5 minutes before adding the onion, and then then garlic (allowing them both to cook for another 7 minutes).  I also added some peas for a little green, but i think it made the sauce more sweet then i wanted, though still good.  I will cook them separately next time.  CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT TIME!!

Delicious. The only changes I made were to not cook through the chicken before simmering as I worried about it drying out, adding potatoes and carrots, and I probably dumped in double the curry and about a tablespoon of pepper flakes.

We love curry so I doubled the amount of curry and also added 1/2 each thinly sliced orange & yellow bell peppers.  I didn't mind the sauce being a bit runny because I served it in a bowl with chopped peanuts and cilantro on top.  This gave it a crunch & a flavor punch and made it look very appetizing.

This was a good dish and I'm giving it 5 starts based on how I tweaked it a little....(I cook like Rachel Ray, so no exact measurements)....Added a "dash" of ground ginger and cumin, and a couple springs of saffron.  Used approx. 1 tbs red curry paste. Omitted the tomato sauce, but used the liquid from the diced tomatoes.  There will be a lot of sauce, but it compliments the rice very well so you're not left with dry chicken and rice.  Next time I'll roast some coconut to top off the dish and to give it a more coconut flavor.  Overall, this is a keeper!

Love this recipe!  Authentic flavor without a lot of fuss.  Great base to build off of - could go vegetarian with potatoes, cauliflower and yellow pepper.  I used fresh tomatoes and they worked fantastically.  I also added a splash of milk at the end to add creaminess.  Serve with naan to soak up the wonderful sauce!

I was a bit underwhelmed. As was my husband. We're big curry fans, and I was excited to try a new curry recipe. We both thought this tasted like ketchup. It was good, just not what I was looking for. My one-year-old liked it quite a bit.

This is the very first time I am writing a review and that's because this dish is AWESOME!!! I am a pretty good cook and didn't think that with these ingredients it would taste like it did when I was on vacation. Well, IT DID!!!  I also let the curry paste "sweat" in the oil for about 5 minutes, which makes a big difference.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!! Easy, quick, cheap and awesome. Can't ask for more.

I've had this a few times at a friend's house and it was wonderful.  I went to make it myself tonight, because I had coconut milk and chicken I wanted to use up, but I didn't have any tomatoes or tomato sauce on hand.  All I had was a jar of pasta sauce, which was basically tomato sauce with basil and some other seasonings in it.  It turned out great.  I also added some broccoli.  I do like the original recipe better because I like all the tomatoes in it, but it's nice to know I can get by with pasta sauce if need be.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe, for one I only used 1 chicken breast as I was only cooking for me and my boyfriend. Second I added 1 diced potato. It turned out great, it thickened to perfection and was really good. The only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because I really couldn't taste the coconut at all, which is what orginally drew me to this recipe.

Really good and simple.  I used 2 chicken breast halves and added three small red potatoes and one carrot, and cut everything in very small pieces.  We didn't have tomato sauce or canned tomatoes, so we cut up a fresh tomato and used a little over half a can of tomato juice.  Made this way, it was a little too sweet and could have used less sugar.

my bf and i loved it! he said it was one of the best things i have ever made. i cooked the curry powder in oil for about 4 mintues, then added onion and cooked till translucent. i followed the recipe except i only used 2 Tbs sugar, and add a little bit of red pepper flakes. i cooked it in a WOK, it worked great... i had the lid ON, simmered for 1 hour, stirring every 10 min. the sauce thickened up perfect! (i don't understand why others said it was watery) i added peas during last 10 min., they added a sweet element plus a green veggie- yum. i served with medium grain rice. this dish is amazing and easy. i think next time i might add a little potato or any other veggie i feel like just for variety. definitely a keeper.

A simple, fabulous curry. Definitely better made a day ahead so the flavors can blend. We've also made this with firm tofu and loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband loves this recipe, although I think it will taste better if it's a little bit more spicy. I added another tbsp of curry powder and potatoes. Maybe if I can find some sort of spicy curry paste, it will definitely taste great! This recipe will be great to make when I have guests around.

This was pretty good, and I made it as the recipe states.  The sauce was too watery so I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up.  The chicken tasted a bit bland, I wish it had more of the curry taste to it.  Maybe next time I will cut the chicken into smaller bites. I served it over white rice with a side of edamame.

I absolutely loved this dish. I cooked the curry in oil for 5 minutes instead of 1 minute. Turned out great. I served over lo mein noodles instead of rice.

This recipe was good but if I hadn't added extra spices it would have just tasted like tomato sauce and coconut milk without much seasoning. At the end of cooking I added a handful of red pepper flakes and some cayenne. The sweet coconut milk and the spice combo was great. EDIT- I made this again and added a jalapeno in addition to the cayenne and red pepper. Perfect. Broccoli and green peppers went along with it nicely.

Excellent dish.  I supplemented curry powder with 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tbs cayenne (for a little heat), and 1 tsp mustard powder.  I recommend for the first time curry eater!

Excellent recipe; fast, easy, and tastes wonderful!!!  I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, left off the sugar, and substituted petite tomatoes (pureed in the blender) for the stewed tomatoes. Then served with steamed rice.  You are going to love this!

I used light coconut milk and that in itself could've been the major issue here- no freakin taste. I can only give this recipe a D+. I'm asian so curries mean bold taste and flavour. Not something that's curry with tomatos and tomato sauce splashed into it. Didn't like this recipe and won't be making this again but thanks for the effort tho!

I scaled this recipe down for 3 servings and used half veg oil, half olive oil.  I also sliced an entire onion for it - I started with 1/4 and it just looked like it wouldn't be enough.  I used light coconut milk too.  It came out great! The only reason I'm giving it only 4 stars is because I altered the recipe a bit by adding more onion - the amount called for was way too little.  I served it with white rice and store bought naan.

This meal is GREAT, and the leftovers are actually BETTER!   DEFINITELY add salt to this recipe - I rarely add the called-for salt to things, but this recipe really needs it.  I did not add enough to the chicken (or any to the sauce), and my husband and I just sprinkled on some Tony's Seasoning Salt before we ate it.  It made a world of difference!  Also, your house will DEFINITELY smell like curry for at least 24 hours, but the meal is worth it ;)

This is a great, easy recipe. I used lite coconut milk and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I omitted the sugar. I also added chopped peppers (red, orange and yellow) and potatoes. Instead of baking I used a crock pot. I served it over brown rice. Delicious!

Next time I think I'll use lite coconut milk BC that is really really fattening but  it's good!

This was excellent! I used about 3 Tbs red curry paste instead of the powder and added a spoonful of roasted red pepper paste to it. I used a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste instead of the stewed tomatoes and sauce. The ending result was a rich, thick, spicy sauce that we really enjoyed. I didn't add sugar, but added a little fresh grated ginger and used lite coconut milk.

Hubby REALLY loved it, the girls and I thought it was good. Followed someones advice to make the curry broth and it was wonderful. I made this in the afternoon and let it simmer for 2 hours, then let it sit for another 2 hours just covered before I rewarmed for dinner. YUM! Added lots of peas and served with rice and Naan

A great curry dish, that wasn't too strong.  I loved the coconut milk flavour.  The tomatoes were a little overpowering, maybe I'll try it with less next time, but still a great dish.  I threw it into the crockpot after heating all the ingredients as stated in the recipe.  Thanks so much!

I love this and share it with friends and coworkers! It is perfect for my low carb, healing foods diet.    It sets up well in an hour if you simmer uncovered and use regular coconut milk, not light coconut milk.  The only difference between the 2 is that the light milk is watered down.  Check the ingredients.  That may be why it is runny for some.

Wow, this is awesome.  I'm a curry rookie, but this recipe didn't show it.  The biggest difference I found in the printed recipe is that it really does take a long time to simmer on the store, and yes, you must do it uncovered.  I have a splatter shield which I highly recommend using.  Next time I'll throw more chicken in along with a red bell pepper.  And even though it tasted awesome, I would feel better about myself using a can of lite coconut milk.  But I'm hooked.  I also found that heating up the leftovers for lunches the next two days still tasted great.

Mild flavor for my taste but the family thought it was spicy enough. I made it with 3 chicken breasts and 2 thighs and tofu. I browned tofu before adding to sauce. I simmered dish for an hour

Not much I can add to the raves here.  I used light coconut milk and the taste was awesome; restaurant quality for sure.  I had no trouble with it thickening up at all cooking it uncovered for 40-50 minutes.  Flavorful, fragrant, sauce, tender chicken, just a wonderful combonation of tastes.  I served over jasmine rice that had been cooked in chicken broth and white wine and the was as good as a similar dish in one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten.  I did end up adding more curry (can't say how much, just added a little and tasted and repeated until it was the way I wanted it) after tasting the sauce with the tines of a fork about 20 minutes into cooking it.  I did as Stephanie suggested and cooked the curry and oil for more like 10 minutes to release all of the flavor and I used diced onion instead of slices.   My 3 year old loved it as well.  Beautiful dish as well!  Thanks for sharing Roma!

We love this recipe--my husband and I made this a few times before rating and both agree that this is a a keeper.  It is a great recipe as is, but we both love it with diced red peppers--we added these with the onions.  We prefer it over brown basmati rice--yummy!

This was simple to make and I was shocked that my entire family loved it- even the kids!  I used lowfat coconut milk (because it was on sale:)) and it still thickened up and was delicious.  The only other ingredient I changed was to use thai red curry paste instead of curry powder, because I had it on hand. I used about a tbsp and a half instead of 2 tbsp because I was worried about it being too spicy for the kids, but it wasn't even close to being too spicy so I think I could have used the full amount.  I simmered it uncovered for about one hour.  Everyone loved it and asked for it to be added to the recipe list we pull from when making our menus each week.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is weird because I bought an Allrecipes cookbook with this recipe in it.  The recipe in the book calls for 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and there's no mention of tomato sauce other than in the review they (allrecipes) added on the side of the recipe.  Never the less I made this with a few changes that wouldn't change the flavor.  I omitted the salt but forgot the black pepper. After tasting it was missing bite, this was my fault b/c I forgot the pepper.  All in all it's a great recipe though I'd add more tomatoes next time, maybe another can of drained diced tomatoes.

It was a nice change from the everyday.  I personally found it too sweet.  I had added some red pepper flakes for heat and found it was a nice blend.  I let it simmer on the stove all afternoon and the house smelled fantastic.

There was a bit too much tomato sauce taste to the dish....however, the kids loved it even asked to have 2nd & 3rd servings as well as lunch next day....personally I would boil the tomato and tomato sauce separately first to get rid of some of the sourness before adding it to the dish.

This is good, but it's extremely mild - I wouldn't even call it a curry, but just a dish with a little bit of curry in it.  I don't know, maybe it was just the kind I used, but I even added a lot more curry and left out the sugar, and it was still very mild.  It was good for what it was, but I love curries and this wasn't what I was expecting.  If I were to make this again, I would use curry paste instead of powder and add some minced ginger in with the garlic.

This recipe was very good but it did require uncovered simmering for 40 mins on medium heat in order to thicken the sauce. I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it some heat. I will make this again!

YUMMY! And easy!  And a nice change!  I cooked exactly as the recipe said, except that I added some Sriracha for spiciness and cornstarch/water for thickness.  Served with Jasmice rice.  My husband and I both went back for seconds. Mmm mmmm... thanks for the recipe!  I'll be making this a lot.

This is a totally yummy concoction. The heat of the curry blends beautifully with the cool of the coconut. I serve it with small bowls of chopped apples, peanuts, and raisins for topping. I accidentally bought coconut cream instead of milk, so I used that and eliminated the sugar. You can spice it up by adding extra curry powder or a hotter blend.

Great recipe. First time I've ever made something like this. I made some Naan to go with it and it was amazing. I drained the tomatoes a little and let it simmer uncovered for over an hour so that it would thicken up. Then I served it over Jasmine Rice, it was great!

Very taste, but being from the islands this need some more curry and seasoning.  So i add more season and hot pepper and more curry powder.

Very Good. I made according to directions and it came out as a great meal. I thought the coconut would be overpowering, but I was wrong. It's nice and creamy, and the curry isn't too much either. Served it over white rice

Either the curry powder I used wasn't strong enough or the recipe didn't call for enough because I thought this rather bland and too sweet.  I added about twice the amount of curry before it had enough heat and if I make it again will cut about half the sugar.  I would also add a whole onion.  For the leftovers I threw in some vegetables to stretch it which made a nice addition.

Excellent! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've had a better curried coconut chicken at restaurant. It is delicious though.

Very good and went over well with the entire family (3 yr. old, 5 yr. old and 15 month old!).  My husband and I found it a little on the bland side, so took one reviewer's advice and added red pepper flakes.  This helped tremendously!  We will certainly make again.

OMG!  This was wonderful!  I did not have curry powder on hand, so I created my own w/ 3/4 tsp of the following:  chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, ground cummin & coriander (spelling on these items is questionable).  Followed the rest of the recipe as written - although I think I let my broth cook longer than indicated in the instructions - and served over brown rice.  My husband and I couldn't stop making yummy noises...  I brought to work for lunch the next day and was just as good.  Thanks Roma for an awesome recipe that will defintely be party of my rotational!!

This turned out wonderful!  I love my crockpot and love anything that can be cooked in there.  I basically threw everything in together (excluding the oil, of course)  I also cut the sugar in half as suggested.  Shredded the chicken after cooked all day, sauce was soup like consistency.  Served in soup bowls with scoop of rice. Will definatly make again

I've made this multiple times and absolutely love it!  I like to add a little crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit.  I've also used extra firm tofu in place of the chicken a couple times to make it a vegetarian dish - tastes great either way!

Very good and easy to make! I added green peppers with the onions, and use alot more curry. I also added about 3-4 tbsp of pineapple juice and some cut up pineapple, and used less (1 tbsp) sugar. My husband likes it spicy, so we also sometimetimes add crushed red pepper for a kick!

Ok...this was seriously good! I made this tonight for dinner and my husband couldn't stop raving about it. I loved the flavor! I just cooked up some rice and served the chicken over it, and it turned out great. I kept everything just how it was called for. Thanks for the recipe!

I was surprised how easy and delicious this recipe was. I'm an Indian food novice and this was the perfect recipe to start with. I let it simmer for about an hour and it thickened up very nicely. It definitely needed a little salt, but was inhaled shortly after I put it on the table. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious.  But "as is" it was only a 4 star.  It had hardly any heat, so as a family preference we kicked it up a few notches with some chili powdewr and a little hot chili oil.  I also added a heaping of veggies, Broccoli, Cauliflower, carrots, 1 small can of cubed Pineapple after the chicken cooked.  Also 15 min. before it was done we threw in in chopped cabbage and a extra sprinkling of seasoning salt.  Served hot over rice.  MMMMMmmmm it was delicious! In fact my family asked to have the left overs for Breakfast the next day!

Probably one of the most delicious curries I've ever had. For more flavor and texture add around half a pound of sliced mushrooms and a Bay leaf. Excellent recipe!

Very tasty dish.  I made this last night and LOVED it!  I followed the recipe except putingt the stewed tomatoes in the chopper for a smoother texture. I don't like the taste of whole tomatoes.  Because I did this I ommited the tomato sauce.  Didn't want to over do the tomato flavor or have the sauce too thin.  It was perfect and also quick n easy.  Will definitely put this recipe in my weekly rotation.

This was my first time making a curry dish, and I followed the recipe, and followed some suggestions from the reviews, like letting the oil and curry cook together for a few minutes first, then adding the onions.  It was wonderful!  Will be making this again!

Thanks for submitting this. My 7 year old son helped me make this for dinner tonight (I figure he'd eat it if he made it!) and it was a big hit with my whole family. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect, although it probably simmered for closer to an hour. The sauce was delicious and it was very healthy served with brown rice. I also served fresh cilantro on the side.  Perhaps next time I will decrease the oil and use the light version just to make it a little 'lighter'...Will DEFINITELY be making again!

Was hoping the dish tasted as good as it sounded, but was a disappointment. It lacked flavor and took much, much longer to simmer than stated. I will definitely make again in the future and will be sure to add additional seasoning.

I love this dish My Hubby liked it too.  What I did differently was to use couscous as a side and I added sweet peas to the boxed recipe. It was also more appitizing to use a little less sugar an add a little more spice.

Good recipe!  But to all those that are stating this is an Indian curry, you are mistaken.  This is a carribbean or island curry.  Completely different, but still good int their own ways. Just had to put that out there!

Amazing! I happened to use lite coconut milk because that was all I had on hand. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and the kids and I loved it. My secretary also helped herself to my leftovers at work the next day. I served this dish with Trader Joe's brown basmati rice and steamed broccoli. A+!

I made this tonight and it is delicious.  I used bone in chicken pieces and removed the skin only.  Once it was browned, about 10 minutes, I removed the chicken to stir the sauce together in the pan.  I added it back and stirred it in the sauce then covered the pan for about 15 minutes to steam it in the sauce for a bit.  I uncovered the pan, turned the chicken and let the sauce reduce for another 1/2 hour.   It was perfect. the chicken was so tender and flavorful.  The whole family really enjoyed this.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this!

This is one of my top ten favorite recipes on AR. I love it! We like to spice it up with 1/2-1 tsp. of red pepper flakes and always add a vegetable. I think a half cup of chunked pineapple would be a delicious addition as well.

After reading the reviews about the recipe being too watery, I substituted tomato paste for the sauce, I also used agave nectar instead of sugar. It turned out very creamy and tasty. This is a great, easy dish!

This was great, a little sweet for our tastes so I added some homemade chili pepper ( made from 12 different hot chili's and very hot, so just a sprinkle was perfect) it gave it JUST the kick it needed. After reading the other reviews I also took the lid off halfway through and let it continue simmering, it was perfect, just the consistency perfect for over sticky white rice. I watched the rest of the leftovers disappear from the fridge today :) will MAKE this again. OFTEN... thanks so much for the recipe

This is a great recipe!.  I used less chicken (it's only my husband and me) and the same amount of liquids, so I simmered it uncovered so that the sauce would thicken more.  If I made it with 2 lbs of chicken, I would have done it covered, though.  My only suggestion is using a little more curry.  It was delicious how it was, but a little more curry would be even better.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved this! Absolutely delicious!! I didn't make too many modifications, this recipe is excellent, I just reduced the amount of coconut cream and tomota sauce since so many complained it was too watery and I tripled the garlic...I'm a garlic lover! This recipe was superb, and I'm a picky eater that loves alot of flavor and depth in my food.

Never made curry before, and I am sure that what I did would be considered completely improper for serious curry-eaters, but here goes. I used my crockpot, and heated the oil, onions and garlic on hi for about a half hour, or until the onions were soft. Then I added the coconut milk (lite), tomatoes and sauce, sugar (used only half) and chunks of chicken that were still partially frozen. Cooked on low for about 4 hours, added about 1 tsp salt, then threw in a bag of mixed frozen cauliflower, broccoli and carrots. cooked another 45 minutes or so and served over basmati rice. Delish! Just the right amount of heat for me, but I am a bit of a wimp. 
Update - I have also used turkey breast, and that works really well in this recipe. Not too dry. This time I added diced fresh eggplant, mushrooms and zucchini - makes a great stew and works really well on Weight Watchers!

I made this dish this evening and it was AMAZING!. My husband thought it was great, but it was a bit sweet for him. I thought it was perfect. My kids (2 and 4) loved it too. They finished their plates and without any fuss. They rarely ever do that. We have to practically force our 4yr. old to eat any meal. He ate it all. I will definately continue making this dish. I can't believe how simple it was to make and yet ended up so wonderful.

This was exactly what I was looking for...so tasty!  I did add a touch more salt and sugar to my liking, and added some crushed red pepper flakes to turn up the heat.  My husband likes potatoes in his curry, so I added a diced potato which helped to thicken the sauce during simmering.  For a little crunch, I toasted some coconut flakes to garnish.  This recipe will be a staple in our home!  Love it!

This turned out great! Although I would change the sugar requirement to "to taste" as 3 tablespoons was too sweet for us. Also I think it could've handled a whole onion instead of a half...less waste that way. Will definitely make again!

I've never made curry chicken before, so I was a bit scared to make this recipe.  I had no reason to be scared.  This chicken was so delicious and so easy to make.  I didn't change anything in this recipe.  It was perfect the first time I made it.  Thank you!

you can't mess this recipe up!  if it's too watery and you don't want to wait for it to cook down, just use some cornstarch and it thickens in seconds!  it's delicious!

Take the chicken out when it is just cooked or it will get dry and hard. I served this over jasmine rice and it was great. My 2, 4, and 7 year olds ate it up. I will add a bit of red curry powder next time for some kick.

Wonderful as written. I read the reviews and after making it per recipe the first time, I've done a couple of things different. I never quite make it the same way twice now. 1. I heat the curry in the oil 2. just about any tomato product will do in the place of the whole tomatoes I just use what's in the cabinet. 3. I really like eating this over unseasoned Ramen noodles. 4. Add a little Tobasco sauce to kick it up. Keeps the same flavor, but gives it a kick. 5. I cook this uncovered so it thickens. 6. If it won't thicken don't be afraid to use just a little corn starch dissolved in water, added just a tiny bit at a time. A real keeper!

When I first set this curry to simmer I was a little worried about the blandness of the flavors, but after taking the other reviewers' suggestions to let the curry simmer for 2-3 hours, my thin, mild and too-tomatoey broth became a thick, fragrant and supremely tasty.  I highly recommend this recipe, just add a bit more time on for the flavors to develop into pure deliciousness.

Very good flavor, not overly spicy, although I halved the recipe and added extra curry since we like the spice.  I also substituted about 1/4 c ketchup for the tomato sauce and most of the sugar since I was using leftover diced tomatoes and did not want leftover tomato sauce.

Boyfriend loved it. Browned chicken in the curry/oil mix and set aside. Used 1/2 can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and pureed. Returned the chicken to the tomato/coconut mixture and simmered for 1/2 hour uncovered to reduce. Added potatoes as well. Served over brown rice.

YUM!!!! My family (especially my mom) and I LOVE indian food, and this tasted just like the stuff we had at an authentic Indian restaurant the other week. I DID change a few things though, mainly because of a lack of ingredients. I did not have coconut milk, so I used toasted flaked coconut. I skipped the tomato sauce, since there would be no creaminess of the milk to balance out the acid and tomato-y taste- I didnt want the tomatoes to mask the yummy curry flavor. I drained the tomatoes and skipped the sugar, since the flaked coconut was very sweet. Finally, I cooked the onion, garlic, and curry powder a little longer to release a little more flavor. I'm sure that when I have all the right ingredients next time, this dish will taste even more heavenly! For all of you wanting a relatively simple Indian dish, I certainly recommend this one. By the way, Cook Stephanie's review was very helpful to me in my minor alterations :)

I simmered this way longer than the directons say and finally gave up b/c I was starving.  Let the remainign simmer all through dinner and it never got thick.  Oh well.  I still enjoyed it and will make it again.  The only changes I made were using onion powder in place of onions (despise onions blech) and used broccoli instead of the stewed tomatos.

This is my favourite curry recipe I've tried from this site so far. I didn't have any curry powder, so I used curry paste instead. I also added a few red pepper flakes to add a little extra heat. I didn't have enough chicken, so I added a cut up sweet potato and it went great with the rest of the dish. I simmered it uncovered for the last 5 minutes and it was the perfect texture, not at all too soupy. I served it over brown rice. My husband and I both loved it!

This chicken dish is exceptional! I was unfamiliar w/ many of the ingredients so I followed the recipes very closely...it turned out just wonderfully! My husband(who is very picky at times) raved about the dish and wanted to invite friends over for dinner so we could make it for them.  We invited our friends over and they loved the meal and asked for the recipe. Give this dish a try, as I don't think you'll be disappointed! It's delicious

Very good base recipe. I added some grated ginger, decreased the sugar to 1 T, and substituted 8 rounded T of Patak's mild curry paste for the curry powder. If I used the powder, I would add cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. The sauce was creamy and had the perfect consistency. I served it over rice, with naan and a nice fruit salad. Yummy!

My adult sons loved this and gave it a 5 star.  I give it a 4 star.  I thought it was a tad bit to sweet.  Next time I'll only use 1.5 T of sugar. Other then that it was great.

This was delicious. I've made it four times now. Every time it's a hit. My Husband says it's his second favorite food. The first is steak. Yeah, it's that good!

This was my first curry and it was delicious despite my error in adding twice as much tomato sauce. I added more curry powder to compensate. I followed others advice to keep the windows open to help air out the house but I'm not sure it helped!

I've always thought Indian food was so hard to make but this was super easy to make and very good.  The only thing I changed was the coconut milk, I used low-fat.  I served it with naan bread which was a huge hit!  My husband and kids (ages 4 and 2) really liked this.  My kids had so much fun helping me make and roll the naan bread.  I'll be making both again soon.  On a side note my kitchen did smell like curry for over a week so be prepared for that.

Excellent!  The flavors mix together wonderfully so that it doesn't exactly taste like curry, or coconut cream, or tomatoes: they blend together to create a unique flavor that is delicious.  I followed the recommendation to sautee the curry first for 1-2 minutes, then add the onion until it is transparent, then to add the tomatoes, and then continue with the recipe as written.  I don't know if it made a difference or not, but it came out great.

Overall, I thought this curry recipe was too sweet.  I think I will only put 1 tsp on sugar the next time I make this.  This also need to be cooked/simmered for longer (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  Other than those 2 recommendations, it was good!

Really great recipe, but a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll use one less tablespoon of sugar and perhaps some more curry powder.  I also added two potatoes when I added the coconut milk and tomatoes and they were perfect!

Excellent recipe as is.  Made 2nd time for dinner guests, with shrimp, seaweed, and very thin sliced mushrooms over stir fried noodles, with a side cucumber salad and fresh tropical fruit.  Guests raved saying that it was a great goumet meal.

This was an excellent dish! I am definitely not a fan of curry, but I would certainly make this again. I cooked the curry in oil for about 5 minutes, and then cooked the onion and garlic for another 5. I had to add more oil (another tbsp and a half) to thin out the spice mixture enough to coat the chicken. I simmered the mixture, uncovered, for 60 minutes, and it turned out beautifully! My husband said the recipe is a definite keeper.

This is a tasty and very simple curry recipe.  I omit the tomato sauce, because I find that with it the tomato flavor is too overpowering, and just use the can of diced tomatoes.  Be generous with the curry powder, it really adds so much flavor! Also, be sure to add the wet ingredients just before the chicken is cooked - if you let the chicken cook through and then simmer it for another 30 minutes, it will be tough.

This was really good. I did make some adjustments, and therefore might adjust this later. I used chicken breast; next time I might use a mix of boneless/skinless thigh and/or breast. I also added 12 oz. defrosted frozen spinach, and 5 grated baby carrots (wanted to up the veggie content). Oh, and I used light coconut milk (and a whole medium onion, not half). It was plenty of sauce even with the additional veggies, but next time I might add an additional 1/2 tbsp of curry powder. Very solid recipe that I will make again! We will be eating the leftovers tonight.

This was waaaaaaaayyyyy too sweet and sugary for me - so sweet that I cant eat it!  I think that this recipe has potential though.  This explosive sweetness may be due to my own fault.  I tried to follow the recipe as written, however I didnt have sugar so I used splenda.  Splenda is supposed to be 1:1 with sugar, but maybe splenda is still sweeter when it comes to mixing with foods?  I gave this 3 stars because I think even with the 3TBS of extra sugar called for, it would be too sweet still .  I read some reviews and I did not see anyone else who had the same complaint, so I'm going to try this again next week and next time I will only add 1 tsp of sugar at a time and taste to see what works for me...hopefully it will earn more stars for me next time around.

I've made this a few time now and love it each time.  I do use a mild curry that my family loves.  The flavor of the curry really effects this dish.  I'd suggest using a curry you already know you like.

Excellent and easy recipe that is extremely versatile.  I made some slight changes, cooking the curry in the oil longer, then cooking the onions (I used a whole large sweet onion) and garlic until the onions were totally translucent, as well as adding 1 lb of sliced mushrooms, 1/8 cup of coconut powder, increasing the sugar to just shy of 1/4 cup, and omitting the tomato sauce entirely.  We WILL be having this again..it was a major hit with my curry-loving boyfriend and even the 8 year old scraped his bowl clean, though he did add some plain yogurt to "cool" his off about half-way through.  We had to force ourselves to leave leftovers!

This recipe was awesome!! I never made curry before, but this turned out perfect. Changes I made...I added fresh grated ginger, about a teaspoon,and also chopped potatoes. I also used more curry than was called for..I think I doubled the amount. It was not too spicy because the sugar really balanced it. I served it all over basmati rice, and everyone had seconds. :)

Everyone in my family loved this  meal (3 kids under age of 6 plus 2 adults). The flavors are mild enough for children. There were no leftovers. We did take the advice of a previous reviewer and simmered uncovered rather than covered, which thickened up the sauce nicely. This will become a staple in our menu.

This dish was okay, it didn't get rave reviews from any of the 5 adults and 2 kids we had eating this last night.  I'm not sure if the sauce was supposed to thicken at all, but ours didn't.  The flavors were not at all as exotic as I would have liked them and not one of them in particular stood out as exceptional.   Words of caution:   Wash your hair after cooking this, my hair smelled of curry clear until the next day and the house still has the lingering aroma of curry.

This was delicious and unbelievably easy. I followed other reviewer's directions and simmer with the lid off. It's important to keep an eye on the dish though because there is a fine line between runny and too thick.

*2nd time: I'd leave out the sugar for sure; this time around, the sweetness lingered, and it wasn't as curry-like a I had wanted.

I used a little more curry powder than the recipe called for.  Also, like another reviewer recommended, I sauteed the onions and garlic in the curry oil mixture for a little longer, just until the onions were translucent.  Couldn't find diced stewed tomatoes, so I used diced fire-roasted tomatoes. Took the cover off the pot for the last 10 minutes of simmer time, just to make sure it thickened properly.  Served this over rice to rave reviews from my family.  Fantastic!  ***Update***  Almost a week later, my house still smells like curry!  Due to this unexpected (yet not totally unpleasant) result, I will not make this recipe on a regular basis.  Perhaps outside, on the patio, in an electric skillet?

I'd probably give this recipe a 3 1/2, but my husband liked it a lot. I did end up adding a bit more curry powder as I thought it was a little on the bland side, and I threw in some orange bell pepper too.  I cooked this in the crockpot with raw chicken for about 3 hours on high, another hour on low with the lid off. The chicken was VERY tender and I love the coconut. I think I'd like a little more coconut ratio to tomato (but I did use lite coconut so that might have made a big difference). I did end up adding a tablespoon of cornstarch with water to thicken it.  Pretty tasty though :) I thought it'd be good with pineapple.

My husband made this for our family yesterday. It was delicious!  My daughter and her boyfriend loved it and asked for the recipe.   The only adjustment he made was to add a little crushed red pepper for heat.  This is one for the menu at our house!!

I've never had curry before so I don't know what curry is supposed to taste like -- but regardless, this recipe is awesome!!!  I used the bright yellow Jamaican curry and after all ingredients are together in my big cast-iron skillet I let them simmer uncovered for over an hour, until the sauce starts to thicken or we can't stand it and want to dig in.  I serve it over white rice.  I've made it at least 4 times and it turns out great every time!  It has quickly become a favorite and I always make sure there is a can of coconut milk, diced tomatoes and tomato sauce in the pantry.

I am not sure what went wrong, but I follow the recipe exactly and the dish that came out was not really curry! I even put more (3T) curry powder, but it does not taste / smell like curry at all! But it was still nice to eat, that's why I gave 3 stars.

Another easy, but very tasty recipe.  I added sliced green peppers and used a spicy ginger to add a little zest.  My sauce didn't thicken up, but it was a good consistency anyway.  I didn't simmer it as long because the green peppers were losing their color.  I think next time I'll add them when I'm simmering rather than with the onions and garlic.  I like the idea of another cook who added potatoes.  I think I'll try that next time.

This was pretty good.  Definitely a good base recipe.  I think it could use a little more flavor to make it 5 stars.  Easy recipe and I'm glad I tried it!

This was okay.  I've eaten a lot of different curries (Indian, Thai, Japanese,...)  I think perhaps this one is suppose to taste more Indian.  There was something major missing - maybe it was the garam masala, or too much tomatoes.  Not sure...

I followed this recipe as is, with only the adjustment of using light coconut milk. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I made plain chicken for the kids, but in the end, they each sampled this recipe and poured some of the sauce on their plain chicken. :) The light milk didn't have as strong of a coconut flavor, to our disappointment. Served over sushi rice...delish!

This was good - but had way too much coconut flavor for me. I know that "coconut" is in the recipe title - but wow! I'll make it again, but with half the coconut milk the recipe calls for... I think that alteration will make the recipe a keeper.

Yummy... I would have given 5 starts but I added fresh ginger, Paprika, cinnamon, potatoes and carrots. I also doubled the curry.  It was so yummy that I had to resist seconds. Served with jasmine rice.

I've never had curry before so I have nothing to compare this to, but I thought it was pretty good.  I wasn't so sure while it was cooking (I cooked in the crock pot for several hours) the smell was so strong,  but once I put it over rice, I was really impressed.  This isn't something I would make often, but as a once in a while dish, it was pretty good.  *EDIT* After 2 days of eating the leftovers, I've decided that I really like it, and wish there was more left.  Too bad my family didn't think too much of it, or I'd be making it again already!

My husband and I liked this, the kids not so much. I did not put in the full amount of sugar. It seemed a trifle bland; I would like to experiment with different kinds of curry powder.

This is a good meal but, to be honest, I was expecting something more tasty due to all the other great reviews!  A very standard, reliable, easy curry recipe never the less!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I threw in diced sweet potatoes for the last half hour of simmering!  Probably won't make again but it's good to give at least one try!

This is SO good. 

My edits/comments, taken from reviews:
- Definitely need to simmer for longer than the time indicated - At least an hour before it even begins to thicken, and the longer it simmers for, the thicker it gets.  At 30-40 minutes, it was still very runny. Simmer COVERED for the first hour, then take off the lid and simmer on low UNCOVERED. Definitely keep an eye on it so that the chicken/curry doesn't start to stick to the bottom!
- I threw in 1 russet potato - I like potatoes!
I used UNSWEETENED, lite coconut milk from Trader Joe's and thought it was plenty sweet with the sugar added in the recipe.

This makes a LOT of curry - more than 6 servings, I'd say. For two people, I might want to halve the recipe next time so we're not eating it till we're sick of it :)

This is the best curry recipe I've tried on this site to date.  Only thing I changed was using a little marinara sauce in place of the tomato sauce  because I didn't have any. (I know this isn't the best substitute, but it came out delicious.)I will be making this again in the very near future.

This recipe was very good.  It was a little bland so I had to add additional salt and curry powder.  I was looking for an authentic jamacain curry and it did not meet my husband expectations.  He did like it but not what he was looking for.

Very tasty! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and served this together with Thai Cucumber Salad. A perfect blend of flavors! The sauce was indeed runny, but not any runnier than is typical of Thai curries. I thought it tasted fine that way. Next time around, I may try adding some bell peppers to the curry.

This was a simple, quick, and delicious recipe!  My husband had two servings, which rarely happens, so I would give this a six if I could.  The only drawback is that our entire condo is consumed in curry smell . . . hope the neighbors don't mind!  Thank you again.

This is a very good dish to sway spouses who might be hesitant to try curries. It is similar to a quick Tikka Masala and quite a bit less expensive than some of the jar sauces you can find at Sprouts or Whole Foods.

Fabulous!!!  I omitted the tomato sauce, used 3.5 tbsp of curry powder and 1.5 tbsp of sugar and seasoned generously with salt and pepper.  Added some mushrooms, brocolli, and green peppers.  Simmered for about an hour uncovered and the consistency and flavour was perfect.  Will certainly be making this again soon!

Because I didn't have any tomatoe sauce or canned tomatoes, I 'made' tomatoe sauce by tossing a few tomatoes in the processor and then used chopped tomatoes for in place of the canned tomatoes, so I didn't have the 'tomatoey' problem. I used a whole onion for a more 'oniony' flavor and I skipped the sugar because it sounded out of place. I also used some chopped cilantro for flavor and garnish. Yes, I know these are major modifications to the recipe, but the base recipe was a great 'base' recipe and it was delicious!

The tomato sauce overpowers everything else, so you can't even taste the curry or the coconut milk. But, it is a good dish. My husband is even asking for more of it! So if you're specifically looking for a CURRY dish, this isn't it. But if you like tomato, try this one!

good recipe overall, but tasted too much like tomato sauce and not so much like curry.  Add veggies! I used broccoli,celery, and green pepper to give this recipe variety.

Thought it was too "tomatoey" and needed more curry powder. Just OK

We LOVE this recipe, which was shared with my by a friend. I make it vegetarian by substituting two packages of Morningstar Farms "Chik'n" Meal Starters or two packages of Quorn "Chik'n" Tenders. I like it with either one, but my husband didn't like how the MSF starters broke apart. This recipe is even better as leftovers!

This was an excellent dish and very easy. I agree with other reviewers in not adding the sugar and it is best the next day or even a couple of days. A new family favourite for us.

I'm no curry expert, but in my opinion it was weird for it to taste sweet. The flavour was good otherwise so I'll make it with less or no sugar next time and I'm sure it will be better.

This curry is so super yummy.  My family loves it.  It's perfect because it's not too spicy.  I serve it with some browned coconut on top.    Thanks so much!!

Excellent recipe!!  I will not change a thing the next time, expect maybe trying sweetened coconut milk...My husband is usually a very picky eater so I was a little unsure about making it.  He loved it and went out to get the ingrediants so that I could make it again.  I think it is even better on the second day once the chicken has absorbed more of the flavor.  Will be making again.

This was fantastic! This is the third chicken curry recipe I've tried, and definitely my favorite! I've made this several times and these are my revisions: I use 3 chicken breasts in total; I used the tip to cook the onions in the oil and curry until translucent. Once I also added yellow squash; green pepper would taste great too. I have used red, green, or Massaman curry paste instead of the powder. The Massaman was my favorite--I added 3 tablespoons plus an extra can of tomato sauce. I also added some fresh basil. I didn't have a problem with it thickening. In fact, I ommited the simmering part because if you cook chicken for that long after the chicken is already done, it gets way too chewy, so now I just make sure everything is heated through, which only takes a few minutes after adding the liquids, then I serve it up! Great flavor!

Great - my little 3-year old who is a VERY picky eater loved this - I couldn't even believe he tried it, much less polished it off.  I served it over white rice mixed with peas.

Excellant recipe! I made this for my boyfriend and I and the ingredients translated well for just the two of us. I added lots of chopped veg into it as well, mushrooms, onions, peppers and green beans as they needed to be used. It tasted fantastic, Many thanks.

This was good, but was lacking in curry taste I thought.  The whole house smelled soooo strong of curry, but it had a very weak taste.  My husband had to sprinkle more curry powder on it after it was done.  I also put 3 tbls and cut down the sugar.

Loved this!  I followed the recommendation on mixing oil green curry paste, onion, and garlic, for 5-10 mins.  Might burn your eyes so be careful!  I used a lid to cover while doing this.  I also added cauliflower so i could have a veggie with my meal.  I added some red pepper flakes, and paprika for some more heat, but next time i might leave out, it was to spicy!  I also added more curry powder to give more flavor.  I also used Jasmine rice.  I thought this was so easy to make, and tasted like it was straight from a restaurant!

So good. And I used chicken that I boiled the day before, but it was still so flavorful. My husband says "Why go to the Bombay house when you can do this?" Serve with naan and jasmine rice and your good to go!

This was good but needed more spiciness. Perhaps it should be made with red, not yellow curry. I wish the recipe specified. I followed the recipe precisely, but toasted the curry powder and onions in oil as one reviewer recommended. Everyone liked it and a little ground red pepper added some kick, but I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I didn't prefer it to Indian or Thai curries.

I made it tonight with shrimp instead of chicken and it was great! I added mushrooms, celery, and yellow squash to it YUMMMM. I also had to use a Tbs. of cornstarch and water to thicken it, I just couldn't wait 50 minutes to eat it plus it would have made my shrimp tough.

Such a great recipe! I love it as is and then there are other days when I throw in chunks of potatoes, peas, cauliflower, carrots, etc. Excellent as leftovers and I always serve it over Jasmine rice. You can't go wrong with this dish!

Absolutely incredible!! My boyfriend and I swear that this is one of the best meals we have ever had. (In the past six months we have made it at least 5 times and are still not sick of it). The flavors are incredible. We made it once with low-fat coconut milk and it lost flavor and thickness (was still very tasty though). The longer you let it cook, the better it tastes! It is delicious over Jasmine rice and great as a leftover lunch/dinner.

This came out AMAZING.  Tastes phenomenal, my only complaint is the smell! It has been 3 days and I still smell curry every time I walk into my apt.  I bought me a plug in skillet so I can make it again, but next time, make it outside!

My hubby requested curry chicken so I tried this recipe and he really loved it. He wants me to kick up the spice in it next time, but he loved the flavors. I think you have to really love curry to try this though. The smell was really strong, but for us it made it that much more enjoyable.

Too sweet, no heat.  This was simply like nothing I've ever tasted.  Not Thai, not Indian.  I'd agree with LEHIGH98 when they wrote "If you like authentic Indian or Thai food, stay away from this dish....The coconut milk/curry/TOMATO combo was just not very complementary."  Where's the spicy heat?  Where's the basil?  It was good enough to eat since we were really hungry, but than again survivalists have been known to eaten carrion when starved.  The leftovers are still sitting in the fridge being avoided. I won't make this recipe again.

This was so easy to make, and delicious. It reminds me of the curry we used to have in Malaysia. I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables before it simmered, and it was very good. Had to simmer for about 40 minutes uncovered, and added mixture of 1 tbsp cornstarch with about 1 tbsp of water to thicken at the end.

This recipe was good- but not great. I would make it again but with some changes. The sauce did not thicken really. I put some flour into it towards the end, it thickened a bit. I think next time  I will not add the tomato sauce, just the crushed/diced tomatoes.  I added some diced butternut squash. I thought the squash was a nice addition, and after 30-40 minutes of simmering the squash was perfectly tender. Next time I will add red pepper flakes for some more kick.

This was superb.  Took the advice of another reviewer and let it simmer uncovered.  Minor change.  I did 3 Tbls of regular curry and 1 Tbls of hot curry just personal preference.  With the additional curry it was not to much.  Will put this on regular rotation.

The base for this recipe was very nice.  I added 1/2 curry and 1/2 red curry instead of the full regular curry powder (we like it spicier!) Also added a half green bell pepper with the onions and 1/2 the amount of sugar to get the good taste of the coconut milk flavor and minus the tomato sauce.

This was fantastic!  I used less than 2 lbs of chicken and it was still delicious.  I kept all the other amounts the same and made 2 cups uncooked white rice to go with it and it was perfect.  I served steamed veggies on the side.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was one of the best indian dishes I have tried from allrecipes.  And the plus side was, it was so simple to make and we didn't have to run out and try to find a dozen crazy ingredients. We simmered it without covering to let the sauce thicken more quickly as we were so hungry from all the smells.  Next time, we might try it with a little less sugar, although we ate all of it that night.

Very good, but like others that have mentioned in the reviews, to avoid it being too watery (and simmering for hours), add cornstarch towards the end or, add cubed/cooked potatoes to the recipe to thicken.

This tasted pretty good overall, but I added fresh ginger, fresh cilantro and about 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes to give it a little more zip. I would make this again, but I would omit the extra 8 oz. of tomato sauce to let the curry and coconut flavors come through more strongly. Even with those changes needed, I am looking into an empty pan, so I am grateful I found this recipe when I was looking for something new this evening!

This was delicious.  I made slight modifications, because I like mine extra spicy!  First, I cooked the curry in olive oil for five minutes, then I added onion and cooked for ten minutes.  After that, I added an 8 oz can of tomato paste and 4 oz water, and then cooked the chicken for 5 minutes in the curry / tomato mixture (I also added fresh ground salt and pepper).  I then added the coconut milk, fresh chopped jalapenos (2) and 2 chopped bell peppers (red and green) and let it simmer for 30-40 minutes.  I served over jasmine rice.  It was spicy and delicious!!!  We had leftovers, and I was craving them the next day!  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.

This was fantastic! I added frozen peas per other reviews. A great, hearty, warm meal. It was a tad sweet, and I only used 1/2 of the sugar that the recipe called for - next time I will add a bit more curry. It is also great as leftovers!

Everyone loved it! Never cooked w/ coconut milk and not much w/ curry either. Fantastic, followed the recipe as listed....love it. I'll be making it often.

follow up, have made this recipe now several times for friends to rave reviews. I use more garlic than called for as well as hot curry powder. With jasmine rice it absolutely ROCKS!

I read alot of the reviews for this recipe and altered my indredients accordingly. It was an OK recipe, one for those who are trying for curry chicken for the first time it would be a good recipe. But if you've eaten curry chicken before at a resturant and you're looking for that sort of taste/flavor, this isn't the recipe for you.

I finally made this after printing out the recipe months ago.  I made it exactly as written and was really pleased with the results, especially the sauce.  My husband and I agreed that the only change I will make the next time I make it, is that I will use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the breasts.  We think the dark, mosit meat will be better in this recipe.  And I will only use half of the can of coconut milk so there will be less liquid.  Looking forward to making again.  Thanks for sharing.

My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly even though I read the other reviews suggesting modifications.  Because we hadn't tried any curried chicken (either at restaurants or home) prior to trying this recipe I think we went in with no expectations of how this was supposed to taste or look (i.e. , too sweet or too much liquid). Everyone loved it and requested I make it again and I will.

Absolutely heavenly!! As usual, I made my own slight changes and took the advice of others, which mostly consisted of taking a little more time on the sauce: cooking the oil and curry, then adding the onion and garlic, then the tomatoes, then the chicken, and then the rest. It took more time but the flavors were incredible!! I also substituted half of the chicken with a can of garbanzo beans; the flavor of the beans was wonderful in this dish, but the texture of the beans is not as smooth as the other ingredients. I also used more olive oil, one large onion, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, and petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. This is definitely one of my new favorites!

This was a HUGE hit and yet so easy to make! My boyfriend loved it!  I will definitely make this again. I did make a few changes:
3 tbsp of curry powder (instead of 2)
2 tbsp of sugar (instead of 3)
1 red bell pepper (made the curry a little more filling)
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Adds just a little more spice)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2-3 tablespoons cornstarch (thickens up the sauce, but use only if you need to)

This is a good recipe. It could be spicier though. I did end up removing the cover and letting it simmer another 30 minutes or so to reduce the sauce.

I suggest using virgin coconut oil ( it is much better for you- feel free to research) and it adds amazing flavor! I also added red potato and sometimes i substitute fresh sweet red peppers for the tomatoes- yummy! :)

Yummy!  Very mild and delicious sauce.  Simmered uncovered 45 minutes, added 3 tbs heavy cream right at the end.  So mild, though, felt like something was missing, but I don't know what...

I had this to eat for a few days; I added cayenne pepper because I love spicy food. Delicious I will make again…but it will make your home smell like curry for about 3 days keep the windows open.

This one is awesome!  It's tied with the Thai Green Curry Chicken dish from this site and it is a nice little change.  I will be making this again.  Based on previous reviews, I hit it with a little soy sauce, fish sauce, and cashews!

Really good!  I added one potato diced into tiny bite size pieces, & a cup of frozen petite peas to make a complete all in one dish.  I was shocked that my 5 year old & her friend both ate it, as well as my husband who claims he doesn't like Indian food.

This was a good starting point -but I can only give 3 stars because I had to make so many changes to suit MY taste. I was going for something similar to what I order at my favorite (and very expensive) local Thai restaurant. And, I think I came fairly close. Not that everyone would agree with my changes, but here they are: I added 2" of fresh peeled ginger - minced it and tossed it in with the onion and garlic, I replaced the canned tomatoes with 2 freshly diced tomatoes (because I had them), I added one chopped yellow bell pepper, I chopped the sweet onion into good-sized chunks instead of slices, I made sure to use 'sweetened' coconut milk, I omitted the tomato sauce and added one fresh lime (juiced), I used 1/8 tsp. of black pepper and 2 tsp. of salt added to the end mixture (instead of seasoning the chicken) as well as 1/4 cup of freshly chopped cilantro and 1 tbsp. of cornstarch. It was still quite a thin sauce, but this is also how it is served at the restaurant I love - so I don't think it is supposed to be thick. After all of these additions and subtractions - I thought it had a wonderful flavor. I am questioning whether adding some pineapple chunks would have been good - I might try that next time. Although I love hot and spicy food, I did not experiment with adding additional heat - because I was also feeding this to my two small children. But if it were just for me and hubby, I would have tried adding some red pepper flakes to start. :)

This is a very good recipe for coconut chicken curry.  I used the basic recipe, however (per suggestions on the site) I omitted the tomato sauce and only added 1 tsp sugar.  I also added a cup of cauliflower and a cup of potatoes and some cilantro so it was a little more substantial for my family.  Served over rice.  Next time I will add a squeeze of lime - but this is definitely a recipe I will make again!

Really yummy! I had to add quite a bit of salt though. Maybe we just like stuff salty.. not sure. Also, I added the juice and zest of a lime, which seemed to brighten it. However, I really think this dish would benefit from the addition of cilantro at the very end. I'll try that next time. Thanks!

This is tasty, and certainly easier to prepare than your more traditional curries.  But I agree that it would be way too sweet as written.  I used about 1 T. honey instead of 3 T. sugar.  Also, the coconut flavor is super strong, so if you don't love coconut you probably won't enjoy this dish very much.  My fiance didn't like it, but I thought it was pretty good, especially considering the ease of preparing it.

Made this last night and it was TASTY! I doubled the onion and garlic and added some cayenne pepper - otherwise I believe it would have been too sweet - and for me, curry needs a little heat!  This was very simple to prepare and my husband enjoyed several helpings! Highly recommend.

This recipe is a good base start with but rating the actual recipe, well it isn't that interesting. I did a lot of modifications, more curry, more garlic, more onion and addition of spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg). After that I had a serveable curry but nothing spectacular. If you have never made curry before it is a good place to start but feel free to spice it up!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is easy to make and super delicious!  To my recipe I add yuca or mandioca instead of potatoes.  It adds a nice body to it.

This was just okay for me. Not nearly spicy  enough to be called even mildly spicy. I will add basil to the leftovers, maybe some green beans or green bell pepper, and some crushed red pepper and see if it improves this to the rating it has been given.

I made it just as the recipe states and it was so good! This dish got rave reviews at our dinner table tonight. I have frozen half for a quick dinner another night...hopefully it will be just as good. Now, if I could only get the house to stop smelling of curry!

Good flavors.  I followed the advice of others.  I used 1 Tablespoon of sugar. Added red and orange bell peppers.  I drained the tomatoes and cut back on the tomato sauce to 1/2 can.  I should have cut it back to 1/4 can.  It got a little to soupy.  I would definately make it again.

Delicious! I used tofu instead of chicken and it turned out wonderfully. What a great, easy to follow recipe.

This is really good.  I throw eggplant and other veggies in with the chicken too.  I also serve with that flat bread.  I have made it twice now and am happy with this one.

Not bad, but this tasted nothing like the curry dishes we get from our "usual" place. The search continues! I am not sure if I will make this again. Thank you for sharing!

tasty recipe. however, it was a bit on the sweet side for me. i thought it was a bit soupy too... so i added more garlic, about 2 tsp red pepper flakes, a can of garbanzos, 2 med red potatoes (diced), and 1/2 of a small can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce.
like i said, good recipe. i just had to adjust it to my taste.

Not the best coconut curry that I have every had but it was really good and easy to make. One reason I chose the recipe is because there were not any ingredients that would be hard to find. Alot of time I steer away from recipes that have alot of specialty items because then you will end up spending alot of money on an item you will only use a few times... but very good for a simple recipe!

ugh... this is NOT what I was expecting... tasted NOTHING like coconut curry I've had before. Perhaps I was expecting Thai style and this is Indian? NO idea, but I won't be making this again.

Excellent recipe. Easy and satisfying. Making it for the second time right now. 

We like things spicy, so we added in a couple of chopped chili peppers.

I would also recommend making some Naan bread to go with it; delicious!

I used skin-less chicken thighs instead & cooked it in my slow-cooker. 
Like others we found it a tad too sweet & not enough curry flavour.

Very good! I thought it had a nice flavor. I did add a little extra curry powder. Great over brown rice. I may try adding cubed butternut squash next time. I think that would be a great flavor combination.

Wow!  All I can say is this was delicious.  My husband went back for thirds, even as sweat poured off of his brow from the heat of this curry.  Next time I might cut back a just a bit on the curry powder.

This is super yummy.  I made mine with mushrooms, baby corn, and a red bell pepper.  I couldn't find any diced stewed tomatoes, so I just used regular diced tomatoes.  I added crushed red pepper flakes at the end.  This is such an awesome recipe! And super easy!!! Thank you!

This was nice. However, I think I burned the curry powder when it was cooking with the oil. Next time I will not cook it for the whole 5 minutes, or I will turn the temp down (it was on medium heat). I added potatoes (3) and carrots (2), which I felt made the meal more complete. Served over white rice. From start to finish, took over an hour. I probably won't make this very often, but it's a good meal if you have a lot of time on your hands. Thanks!

It was pretty good.  We just threw all the ingredients into a crock pot and let it cook over night.  We will probably make it again.  Maybe make it spicy.  The recipe does need salt.

I thought this was really good.  I only used 2tbsp of sugar as some suggested it was too sweet.  I also added some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  It was a little bland, so I added some cayenne pepper as well.  For me, there wasn't quite enough curry to satisfy my curry craving!  Overall, it was easy to make and needed very little tweaking.

This was soo good. Unlike other reviewers, I did not think that it was too sweet. The ONLY thing I changed was that I used more oil than they said to and, like the first reviewer, I made the curry sauce. This was excellent! Plus my 1 1/2 year old loved it too!

Sauteed the curry with the oil for a bit as recommended. Used canned, diced tomatoes with their sauce, but didn't use the tomato sauce as we wanted to taste the coconut flavor. Served with basmati rice. Daughters even went back for seconds!

this was pretty good, but i agree that it needed a little something. i made the curry the way cook stephanie suggested (6/11/07). i had 1.2 lbs of chicken to work with so i used less coconut milk and sugar, the full can of stewed tomatoes, and left out the tomato sauce. it was still plenty tomato-y. make sure you use a deep skillet, as this recipe has a ton of liquid.

I wasn't totally fond of this the first time I made this, but when I sauted the curry first and then the vegetables in the curry, and figured out it was an Indian curry (I'm used to the Thai curries) I enjoyed it a lot more.

OMG, so good!  The only thing different I did was to cut the oil down to 1 cup, use fresh tomatoes, add 1 tsp. of red chili, and 1/2 tsp of crushed chili pepper (I like my food HOT).  Next time, I will cut down the simmering time to 20 mintes on medium- that way I have more broth left.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Very good recipe! The only thing I changed was I added 1 more tbs curry(I LOVE curry)and 1/2 tbs vegetable oil. I've made this recipe at least 20 times.. in fact, I'm going to make it for dinner tonight :)

This recipe was so good! My boyfriend also loved it. I added just a few things, yogurt to thicken up the sauce, extra butter (the lowfat yogurt butter), and some cinnamon. I ate it everyday for a week, and it tasted better and better everyday. Of course, my house smelled of curry for a week or two, but it was well worth it! A pretty simple recipe that I will definitely be making again!

I loved this recipe!  I followed it exactly although I don't think I had enough curry powder.  I just dumped what I had in the pot.  I love the flavor of the coconut milk.  It also got rave reviews from my family some of whom have made picky eating a sport!

I made the vegetarian version of this with carrots, peas, and baked tofu instead of chicken.  Very tasty and quite easy!  Not the most authentic curry I've ever had, but good for a quick meal.

Surprisingly great!  Other than using 'lite' instead of the full-fat coconut milk (oh, and thickening at the end), I stuck to the recipe exactly.  Served in a bowl over brown rice.  The next day I added peas to the leftovers for xtra health.  Very tasty!  My sons (4.5 & 18 mos) loved it.  To my OWN PERSONAL bowl, I added both a dash of cayenne AND a generous squirt of sriracha (I LOVE hot food)...  Dee-lish.

A very nice basic recipe.  I added tofu and peas to mine (I just really like tofu and peas).  Definitely cook the curry in the oil as the recipe states.  It helps bring out the curry flavor more.

The taste was okay; my husband enjoyed it. I thought it was best to add either scotch bonnet pepper or red pepper flakes. It needed a kick.

Loved this recipe. It didn't taste like 100% authentic Indian or Thai but It was real close.... I'm very picky because I've had quite a bit of home cooked Indian food. The only changes I made were: added 3 small cubed red potatoes and a 1/8 cup of shredded coconut. Next time I might add more coconut. Will definitely make this again.

Just a side note: make sure to open your kitchen windows and turn the stove fan on, otherwise your house will smell like curry for a week, or more.  Mine still has the faint scent of curry and it was made over a week ago...oops!

Excellent dish!  My hubby and I thought it was delicious and my picky 4 year old actually had some.  I actually made couple of changes.  I used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and added peas.  I'm going to try it with tofu instead of chicken next time.

We liked this recipe served over rice in a bowl.  Next time, I will drain the tomatoes .  We used only 1 Tbs of brown sugar, and it was good - not too sweet.

this recipe is so easy to make.  It's light and tasty, not like some other curry recipes.  I think the secret is to fry the curry powder in the oil for a couple of minutes as per the direction say.  That brings out the curry flavour a lot more.  I just use drum sticks. Didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of Campbell's condense tomato soup. It tasted great.  My kids loved it.  My husband don't usually like to take leftovers for lunch but he took this one the next day.

SO good & works just fine with light coconut milk.  Make sure to simmer the tomatoes and milk with the sugar long enough or else it turns out  a bit bitter.

Amazing. I made two versions of it at the same time.. one was chicken (my fave) and then bite-sized (pre-chopped at the market) beef because DH is allergic to chicken. The beef is stronger so I had to sugar it up a smidge more and in fact needed to make a thickener with cold water + cornstarch + Knorr vegetable boullion (powdered form in a jar). I was low on the tomato sauce (though not the pieces) so ketchup helped out. I used more onion + larger pieces and that was yum. I thought that some green bell pepper would have been awesome to add, too, but did not have any. Bottom line: Fantastic. Restaurant quality and I mean it. Next time? Cashews will be served on top! Can't wait!

I halved the recipe (except for the onion) and followed it exactly.  It turned out amazing and was nice and thick after an hour of simmering.  So good....

Definitely a good dish, but not really spectacular. I added frozen peas to the mix and I also have the complaint that it wasn't thick enough. I feel like it was missing something... maybe peanut sauce. I'll definitely make it again with a few alterations.

This really is good--I read other reviews first, but decided to pretty much follow the recipe as written.  Well, medium high on my new cooktop is too hot to make a decent curry paste, it was fried before I knew it.  Started over closer to medium heat, worked fine.  I'm also one of those who had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, did the old cornstarch routine at the end, even though it simmered for about 45 minutes, next time I'll reduce the liquids.  We loved the end results, though, very impressive recipe--THANK YOU!

This was so yummy. My fiance took one mouthful and goes wow this is really good. That has never happened, normally it's just good or pretty good. I will make this again really soon. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!I did have to thicken the sauce up a little with corn starch.

I think you either love this dish or hate it.  I loved it.  It was different and tasty.  The rest of the family didn't like it, though.

This recipe was really yummy. I made it for 3 servings, so the following changes reflect 3 servings: I didn't have tomato sauce, so I added half a cup of plain yogurt to help thicken the sauce, 2 tbsps of butter, halved the sugar, and 2 tbsps of curry instead of 1 for more of a "kick." Also, I simmered it uncovered for about 40 minutes to help thicken the sauce. I will definitely be making this again! (edited: one day in the fridge later and WOW it tastes even better!)

This was really yummy! I substituted the curry powder for homemade garam masala and added some chili powder for a real authentic kick, and it came out great. Very quick and easy too.

I cut this recipe down to two servings because there's only two of us, but wow, now I wish I hadn't. I used fresh tomatoes instead -- they kind of dissolved into the sauce and just left the skins, which was surprisingly tasty. I think potatoes would be great in this, too.

This was most excellent, and makes a visual presentation every bit as impressive as the taste.  I had to make my own curry powder which was semi-disastrous, and it still turned out delicious, although there was an incredible amount of leftover sauce that didn't particularly taste good on its own (although it tasted great with the chicken)

I made several alterations to this recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions, and the result was good but not spectacular. I followed CookStephanie's suggestion (06/11/07) on preparing the curry base, which seemed to work well. I increased the curry powder to 3 T., only used sugar to taste (less than 1 T.) and only used about half the can of tomato sauce. The result was somewhat bland so I added 2 T. red chile paste, which made it very spicy; a little too much for me but just right for my husband. I also added potatoes and chopped red and green pepper. 
I may make this again, but I will definitely keep looking for a better curry recipe.

I didn't quite have two pounds of chicken, so I was worried about making too much sauce.  I used the exact recipe without the last can of tomato sauce, and it still came out excellent!!!

WOW! This was really good. We made the Curried Coconut Chicken along with the Baingan Bharta (eggplant curry) for dinner and they both were delicious. Forgot to make some basmati rice to go with it, but we did have some naan. Thanks.

Very easy and pleasant taste. I like the fact that you can play around with it and pretty much use any curry mix you have on hand! I only had an indian curry on hand and it worked brilliantly.

This recipe was good, but still lacked something... maybe this needs to be simmered longer than 40 minutes... the taste had flavor but was bland at the same time.  Not my favorite version of coconut curried chicken...

Not a bad recipe - great with jasmine rice - too much tomato flavor for us, next time I will use less tomato sauce.  Only used 1 tbsp sugar - and its a good thing - added an extra tbsp of curry powder - will try again with modifications - also added 1 can of green beans, next time, i will use something fresh -

This is a good recipe but I think If you can ommit Sugar from the receipe and
add fresshly ground Black pepper to it and crushed Garlic and cardom seeds powder half through the cooking process
if you think it is too water or souppy 
try some buttermilk ( BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU ADD BUTTERMILK TO HOT SIMMERING
DISH ADD A DROP IN AT FIRST INSTANT AND STIR QUICKLY SO THAT IT DOES NOT CRUMBLE ONCE THAT IS SETTLED YOU CAN ADD
TWO MORE TABLESPOON AS DESIRED ) 
and I use Cilantro as a garnish .

My boyfriend and I both thought this was so yummy.  I always add a little more curry powder than is in a recipe because I like a stronger curry flavor.  This is a "keeper"!

I added green peppers & sliced carrot. The dish looked great, nice & colorful but it was almost sickening sweet. I only added 1 tablespon sugar & was so sorry I did. Suggest you add sugar after cooking & tasting. It tasted more like sweet & sour and none of us really enjoyed it. It would be OK at a party with plenty of other dishes but as a main meal I wouldn't make this again.

Absolutely delicious! To lessen the cost I purchased some frozen chicken tenderloins and baked them partially in the oven before chopping them up. Also purchased some organic curry powder from our local Co-op and used a Walla walla onion. Even though I messed up a little by adding the garlic first and rushing to add the curry powder before the garlic burned and then rushed in the onions, the recipe still turned out real yummy. Definitely a keeper :). Thanks for such a great recipe :).

This recipe was very easy to make and I followed the suggestion from others to use low fat coconut milk.  Instead of regular sugar,I used to coffee packets of Splenda and added frozen baby peas. Out of fear this would be too sweet for my husband, I added about a tablespoon of hot sauce.  This was perfect served over rice with steamed broccoli!

My husband and 6 year old enjoyed this dish. I added 1/2 cup yellow raisins to it the last 5 minutes of simmering to sweeten it up a bit and served with couscous. While simmering, I thought there was too much liquid and removed the lid for the last 10 minutes, but the extra sauce was very useful when poured over the accompanying couscous. I also served with peas. A tasty and easy recipe!

Delicious!  My husband really enjoyed the flavor... the coconut flavor was just right.  I did not add the tomato paste because we did not want the tomato flavor to overpower the coconut.  Definitely a keeper!

This turned out so good. Some reviews said it was runny so I ued tomato paste. I wasn't sure How long it would be to dinner so put it in casserole dish. Found I didn't have enough uncooked instant rice for full meal so put it in with chicken and covered baked 45 minutes to 1hour. This made the best dish and not one bit runny

Excellent!!!!  After reading reviews, I used only 1 tbsp sugar, but I also used cream of coconut, so it was plenty sweet.
It was very liquidy, so I thickened it up with cornstarch.
Hubby & I liked it.  It was extremely easy to make, very flavorful.  Will be making this on a regular basis.

This was yum!! I didn't put any sugar in it, I added some oriental vegetables, chili powder, soy sauce, and some chilli paste. I dont like the sweet taste of coconut milk, but by adding the hottness, the sweet taste was mild. My husband LOVED this recipe!!! It was just missing something, can't figure out what that is though...hence the 4 stars

I was surprised that I didn't like this given all the great reviews, however, I thought it was too soupy and too bland, even though I added extra spices, especially compared to authentic thai and indian dishes. I wanted to like this but it didn't work out for us.

I am the curry person in our home and I give it 3 stars, but my husband who is not a curry person gives it 5, so the compromise is at 4. Everyone else ate it really well.

Everyone loved this and so easy to make. I read the reviews and made a few changes. I used only 2 tbsp sugar, finely diced the onion. Used only 1/2 the amount of tomato sauc sauce. Simmered for 1 1/2 hrs til sauce was thickened and chicken was tender. Made this with syrian bread on this website. Will make this again!!

This recipe was so simple to make and not a big mess to clean up. I used reduced fat/calorie cocunut milk, no salt added diced toms and sauce. Next time I'll add a little less tom sauces to bring out more cocunut. Otherwise, a great recipe. My husband said I should  make this at least once a week.

I have been making this for a couple of years, with a few adjustments.  I add a few things at the coconut milk stage - a couple of teaspoons of "Better than Boullion" chicken base, a couple of teaspoons of masaman curry base and about 1/4 teaspoon of cumin powder.  This seems to give it a little more depth.  My whole family loves this recipe, even the picky ones.

We loved this. It is my husbands new favorite! I took everyones suggestion amd  decreased the sugar to 1 TBSP. I added green pepper and mushroom and I added cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken it. It was definantly too soupy without the thickening.

Wonderful flavor and easy to prepare.  Used skinless chicken thighs.  A bit too liquidy, but just simmer without the lid for about 30 minutes to reduce.

We love this! My husband requests it and because I dont adore tomatoes and curry, I just add a bit of the chicken/coconut milk in a seperate saucepan and add a bit of cilantro to the pot to jazz it up. That way we are both happy.  So easy! And I agree with adding a bit more salt after it simmers.

I liked this recipe. I added mushrooms. A very different flavor for my husband and I. Maybe next time I will use a little less curry because it had a very strong taste.

Pretty good I didnt have stewed tomatoes on had. It was good and easy to make my two boys ate it even my picky 2 1/2 yr old. I had to "doctor" mine up though. It wasnt hot enough. I added chili powder and more pepper along with garlic powder. After I did that it was really good I even had seconds. I will probably be making this again to have my husband try it.

This recipes was Awesome.  I omitted the tomato sauce and I added some veggies (fresh or frozen work) about 15 minutes before the recipe was done so they didn't get too soggy.    We had friends over for dinner and they thought it was really good.

Delicious.  My go to recipe for coconut chicken curry.  The only change I make is using regular tomatoes (my family doesn't liked stewed so I never have them) and omitting the tomato sauce.  It's not really needed at all.  To thicken at the end I take the lid off for about 15 minutes and turn up the heat slightly.  It thickens up nicely.  Very nice recipe.  Thank you Roma!

This was the first time I have ever used Curry and I love it! Super easy and delicous! I did omit the tomato sauce and did drain the stewed tomatoes,  I added some mushrooms and used 2 tablesppons of sugar instead of 3 as suggested by others. The only thing is that it does stink your house up a bit but it was worth it, I recommend this recipe, it was a hit! I also served it over brown rice with a nice vegetable.

After reading the reviews we made a few adjustments.... We left out the tomato sauce, rinsed/drained the tomatoes, added a tad more coconut milk, an extra clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp more curry powder, a red bell pepper and 3 small potatoes.  We also used less chicken (only 3 breasts).  Turned out GREAT.

Eh.  My husband loved this recipe.  I, on the other hand, wasn't thrilled.  It was just WAY too sweet and rich for me.  We served it with Jasmine rice which seemed to go perfectly with it.  I'd probably make again just because my husband enjoyed it so much...

It was a decent dish if your looking for something different.  Reading people's reviews and reccomendations on the original recipe helped a lot.  It was a BIT bland following the recipe exactly.  I  added more spices and flavoring which helped a lot.

Great recipe.  Left out the tomatoes (not a big fan of them in my curry dishes), added some cayenne, garam masala, cinnamon stick and peppers.  Tasted wonderful and really easy!

My results didn't turn out as well as others.  It was good but I wouldn't call it a curry.  We added fish sauce, red pepper, mushrooms, 'lots o' curry powder, and fresh basil...still was too tomato-ee.  I think if I try it again I will leave out the tomato sauce.  We love Thai food though, so I was hoping for an authentic type dish.  If you're looking for a curry, we suggest the curry paste in the ethnic isle of the store.  But again this was

Wonderful!  This was my first attempt at homemade curry.  I also omitted the tomato sauce and the sugar.  I added an extra tablespoon of curry and roughly a teaspoon of cayenne - perfect!  I also used one 16oz package of extra firm tofu instead of the 2lbs of chicken - we like LOTS of sauce!

I have to say that my 6yr. old daughter, being that she is a picky eater, rated this dish "not bad" and thats alot coming from her.  I do think that it would also be tasty if no sugar was added and salt was added instead.

Really easy and great!  I did do some minor changes though.  Instead of salt, I seasoned it with fish sause.  Also added red and green bell peppers and fresh mint.  I would add fresh basil next time.  I also did not add the tomato sauce but added a bit of cayenne Pepper to spice it up a bit.  It was a hit at work and will make it again with some more flavorful veggies.

I have made this twice now. It is a good meal I serve with basmati rice. I followed advice of others and added more curry & some red pepper, used low fat coconut milk, added celery, peas and garlic. I didn't think it to be too saucy. If you serve it with rice, you need the sauce.

(Round 1) I took some other suggestions and left out the tomato sauce and added some tomato paste instead.  I also added crushed red peppers and chili powder to the curry at the end to give it more heat.  It was really good over white rice.  I've already had requests for it at the dinner table.  Thanks!  (Round 2) I followed the recipe this time - used tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste, and I prefer that better.  Thanks!

Really delicious and simple. Made it for guests the first time, and they went home with the recipe! I amended it a little, for personal taste. Used double the amount of curry powder. I thought the cooking time for the chicken was too long, so right after I coated the chicken in the curry oil, I added red and green peppers and a whole sliced onion. It all cooked together instead. Added some red pepper flakes. Used about 3 tbsp. of tomato paste instead of sauce. Loved it over basmati rice, and was excited to have leftovers! Will definitely make it again.

Really tasty.  I nixed the sugar altogether and let the sauce reduce for about 20-30 minutes because it was a bit too soupy.  I've made it twice already and it is delicious served with some basmati rice.

Wow, this was really good. I was looking for something unique and flavorful for dinner tonight and this was it. I too omitted the tomato sauce. I used 2 T of corn syrup instead of the sugar. Served with wild rice and veggies. Very yum, will make again.

LOVE this recipe. i've made this with tomato sauce and without and there really is no difference. definitely cut down on the sugar- i use only 1 tablespoon. up the sury powder if you like things spicy. it is a curry, so it's supposed to be a little soupy, and it tastes great served over rice. A family favorite.

This was a HUGE hit in my home!  It was so simple to make and the leftovers were excellent.  I would add a bit more curry to this recipe as I found it a tad bland.  I served this over Rice Noodles... YUMMY!

I made this tonight for my wife and kids....and everyone loved it.  Words of advice to those who think it is too soupy ...let it boil down.  I took the lid off and let it simmer for 40 minutes and the sauce was very nice and thick.  I will cut back on the sugar - to 1/2 of what is recommended.  With Jasmine rice its a great meal.

I'm giving this recipe a four because I would have given it a three but my husband gave it a five so that's the average :o).  Couple of variations - I cut back on the sugar A LOT (maybe used one teaspoon) and I added potato since I had that around.  I found the consistency fine but if I make this again I will cut out the tomato sauce as suggested.  My main complaint is that I couldn't taste the coconut - I think all the tomato overpowered it.  Very easy to make though.

This was simple to make and yummy.  I kind of want to try this with chunks of pineapple too.  I used a teaspoon of thai curry paste instead of the powder.

Delicious!  My husband and I just loved it.  Not super strong and spicy, so the kids could eat it too.  I served it with Jasmine rice also and it just soaked up the sauce.  If you don't like sauce, cut it down, if you do, keep it the same.  Awesome.

This recipe is very good. I added some green curry paste to spice it up. My husband loved it, and my husband and I are very picky. I also added a green pepper. With basmati rice it is just wonderful!!

I give it three stars because up until I put the coconut milk in the food tasted GREAT!! I added A LOT of currie and next time I will leave out the coconut. The mixture of Sweet and Salty didn't taste right to us.. Just personal preference.. Other than that, GREAT!!

This is a keeper!  Yes, it was a little soupy and I drained my canned tomatoes but I think it's the cocoa nut milk that makes it soupy but Jasmine rice soaks it all up.  YUM!  I also used a hot curry powder because we like it spicy. This is one that we opened the windows and doors for so that we could make our neighbors jealous!  I have leftovers for lunch today!  It's delicious!

This recipe totally broadened my horizons!  I always avoided curry because I believed it to be so hot....but not this one!  The sauce is amazing and incredibly easy to make.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone afraid of curry.  I've made this for many people and all just love the flavor!  I would recommend serving over basmati rice!

This was GREAT!  It taste just like a dish that I get at an Indian resturant tiki masala!  I do like my food spicy so I add cummin,red pepper flakes, cayen, and more curry. I only add half a can or so of tomato sauce-just enough to give it a redish color and simmered until thick with out the lid on!

Very good. I did drain the chopped tomatoes and simmered for 40 minutes - which causes sauce to be thicker. I will make it again.

I won't make this one again!!  It was very soup-like...way too much liquid.  Also, it was very bland...could've used something to spice it up.  We still ate it, so I gave it a 2-star rating.

I thought this tasted wonderful.  My husband thought it could have been a little spicer.  I didn't have enough chicken so I added potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.  Next time I might add a little more curry or some red pepper.  I'm also going to try adding pineapple.  We served it over rice and it was great!

I have never reviewed a recipe until now.  I really loved this dish.  I did not use the tomatoe sauce but added mushrooms, green beans and topped off the finished dish with cilantro.  Served over Basmati rice.  The whole family loved it.

I LOVE this recipe.  I add cubed potatoes and carrots to make it more of a meal. I also drained the stewed tomatoes.  I've made it 2x and never get tired of it.  I used chicken thighs the last time and the meat stayed nice and tender even though I simmered it for a long time to cook the vegetables through.  It was great! It tastes a lot like my mother's curry stew. Thank you for sharing this!

Excellent!!!!  I didn't have enough chicken, so I added frozen peas and shrimp, which were SOOOO good.  I also added a little green curry paste and served over rice... very, very good... especially reheated.

Fantastic! I have tried so many curries that have failed... this one was fantastic. I used light coconut milk, 1 lb. chicken, and then two potatoes and two carrots cut up.  Served over brown basmati.  Great recipe!

This tasted fantastic and it's easy to make. I added carrots and bok choy and also used hot curry powder for a little extra zing. The best rice to use is basmati, it's just so much better tasting than minute or long grain!

I omitted the tomato sauce as suggested by other reviewers and added some garam masala for extra flavour. Next time I will add mushrooms and red pepper to it. Overall very good and quick!

Delicious!!  I didn't have any tomato sauce so used only the canned, diced tomatoes (drained).  After reading the reviews, I only added 2T sugar.  And I added 2 potatoes and a carrot (cut into big chunks) prior to adding the coconut milk.  After tasting it, it needed more sugar, so I kept on adding sugar until it tasted "right."  It ended up to be 6T sugar, double what the recipe calls for!  (And I don't typically like sweet food)  So I looked at the coconut milk, and it was unsweetened, with less than 1 g of sugar.  Maybe this was the reason why it needed extra sugar?  This tastes pretty close to our local Thai restaurant's "Curry Chicken."  I'm glad that I didn't add the tomato sauce, b/c it tasted perfect without it.

The coconut and tomato combo is great -- a fancy restaurant taste in very little time. My husband love it, my toddler wasn't too interested. But I bet she will be the next time.

This was really good.  I was out of tomato sauce and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and it turned out fine.  Even my little ones liked it and they hate coconut.  Will definately make again.

My husband loved the curry sauce for this recipe.  He thought we could use the sauce as a curry soup.  This was very tasty curry recipe and I'll be making it again.  He loved it.  I used chicken breasts, and Thai Coconut Milk.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. We both like curry chicken, but my husband isn't crazy about coconut, but he ate every bit of this. The tomato soup mellows out the sweetness of the coconut. I served it over saffron rice and we didn't have any left overs!!! At first I thought it was too soupy, but my husband who frequents an indian restaruant at lunch said that is how the dishes there look.  The combination of these flavors together is really good.  I'll make this again.

I love this dish!  I've used cubed chicken, as well as, ground turkey and both turn out fantastic.  I pile all the ingredients (after browning the meat) into a slow cooker and let it go on low all day.  Its easy, flavorful and it's the closest i've gotten to making an Indian dish that actually resembles a traditional Indian dish that you would get in a resturaunt.

We did not like this very much.  The coconut milk/curry/TOMATO combo was just not very complementary.  Way too tomatoey.  If you like authentic Indian or Thai food, stay away from this dish.  I'm putting the leftovers down the garbage disposal right now.

Add more Curry if you want to make it spicier.  Though it is an Excellent recipe as is.
