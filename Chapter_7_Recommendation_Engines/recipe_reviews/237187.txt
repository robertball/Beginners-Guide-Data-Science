A very good, warm, tasty and filling soup.  It hit the spot on a VERY cold January night. After reading the ingredients, and knowing we would like this soup, I doubled it, for a very large pot.  I froze a container for my in-laws and have a container for my parents.  The ingredients work well together, and could easily be adapted to your family's favorite pizza ingredients.  For the first time, I made as written, with the exception of the dried ravioli.  I could not find it so I used dried tortellini.  The next time, I will use Italian sausage in place of the hamburger and add green peppers. As the soup cooled, some of the broth has soaked up in the pasta.  I will just added a little additional beef broth when I reheat the leftovers.  A wonderful soup that we enjoyed with a hard crusty roll.  Thanks Angie for sharing your recipe.

This was easy and delicious! The family loved it. It is still delish without the mozzarella on top.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. I wanted pizza but without the crust. I'm not a fan of pepperoni but added it anyway and I liked it. I left out the pasta because I didn't have any. I will be making this again.

I used tomato paste instead of sauce. and i used meat raviolis rather cheese.  then I boiled the ravioli in both chicken and beef broth seasoned to taste waiting forthe ravioli tocome to top of soup.  Add parmesan cheese to soup in bowls.  My family just loves it.
