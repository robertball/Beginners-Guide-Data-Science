No, it's not a chocolate chip cookie, really, nor is it quite an oatmeal or peanut butter cookie either. None of these flavors is predominant. The recipe pulls it all together so that the flavor of these cookies becomes its own.  I followed the recipe making no changes, although to make them "spring-y" I substituted pastel M&Ms for the chocolate chips.  I used a 1/4 c. cookie scoop, flattened them slightly and baked them at 375 degrees, about 10-1/2 minutes.  I am SO pleased with how these turned out! They baked up real pretty - hefty and nicely shaped, with sort of a craggly top.  They are a mitt-ful, which only saves the time of reaching for another!  They're light and tender, soft but slightly crispy - the characteristics we so often look for in a "chocolate chip cookie."  Only six reviews beneath mine - hopefully that will increase as more bakers decide to give this recipe a try.  This was a happy find today.

The perfect oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip cookie.  My only alteration was to add in mini yellow and pink chips.  These baked up perfectly and didn't go flat like so many other peanut butter cookie recipes.  Just a nice, hearty cookie with lots of texture and flavor.

I've made these biscuits many times and they are definitely my "go to" recipe.  I use half whole wheat and half all pupose flour and usually use 3/4 to 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  The biscuits rise very high and are so flavorful.  Thanks for a great biscuit recipe.

Pretty sweet, I'd like to cut back on some sugar.  If you can not decide whether to bake an oatmeal cookie or a peanut butter cookie or a choco chip cookie, this cookie is for you. De-lish and worthwhile!

A little gem of a cookie - baked up perfectly: slightly crisp, yet chewy. As I peeked through the window of my oven during the first batch, I thought I might have to flatten them slightly on the next batch to make sure they bake through. Well, after a few minutes on the cooling rack, they deflated and I was left with a cute little cookie that was baked perfectly! Rather than chocolate chips, I added butterscotch chips since my bf doesn't like chocolate... Though it seems the cookie has an identity crisis (PB? Oatmeal? Chocolate chip???), it was a hit! :)

This recipe was delicious! I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening instead of the 1/2 cup butter and they turned out good. The only thing I would have changed is if they could have been more of a soft cookie. Also the batch made 3 dozen cookies for me, but maybe I just make small cookies.

I am not a baker, and these cookies were my first attempt at 'made from scratch' baking since I was a teenager! That being said, these came out very good! I didn't rate them 5 stars because hubby thought they were a little dry (I did too, but I am usually pickier than he is). Next time I make them I'll try using more brown sugar and less white sugar, to see if I get a moister result. However I just loved this combination of chocolate chips, oatmeal, and peanut butter. It was a huge hit with my 5-year olds and I like the fact that there is a little protein in there for them. Great cookie recipe, thanks!

Nice choco/ PB blend with some oats tossed in for good measure. I made a few subs but they still turned out great. 1/2 c applesauce instead of butter, only 1/2 c of sugar plus a touch of molasses, and a couple handfuls of walnuts. They needed about 15 minutes in the oven on parchment paper and the result was delish! 

Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! Made these this afternoon - rolled into 2 dozen balls and baked 10-11 minutes and removed to cool on wire rack immediately. They came out soft and perfectly delicious! My husband and son give their thumbs up too. :)

I used an extra 1/2c. flour, milk chocolate chips and flattened them. Good but not over the top. Doesn't make very many either.
