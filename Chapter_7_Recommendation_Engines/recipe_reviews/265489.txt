This is now one of my go-to recipes. It’s quick, easy, and flavorful! I usually do chicken instead of ham and cook it separately before adding it in. I love it!

My boys loved this. I never follow recipes exactly, but I followed this one pretty closely. It also made enough for several servings, so left overs were plenty for lunches :)

Proportions did not suit me.  Not enough pineapple for the amount of rice.  I can see this is a great recipe, but needs tweaking.  Not enough of the soy sauce mixture for the amount of rice either, I say double it.

Very easy, but way too much pineapple for me — we used fresh, not canned, and almost all of the other flavors were completely drowned out, even the ham (and we used more ham than the recipe called for). Would maybe try again with less pineapple.

Followed recipe almost exactly, but use the sesame oil didn’t have any and I used canned peas and cans. Don’t really for freeze. Turned out real good. Everyone loved it
