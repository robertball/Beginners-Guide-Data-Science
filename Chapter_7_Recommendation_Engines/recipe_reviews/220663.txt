A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!! I used about 3/4 tsp. each salt and pepper, and that seemed to be perfect for us. I was a bit leary of the Italian seasoning, but it really gives them good flavor. I did use the optional garlic, which is a must, IMO. Be sure to use a good extra virgin olive oil. I've been eating them straight out of the fridge, but plan to make a salad w/ them for dinner, if they last that long, lol. These would also be great on an anti-pasto platter, which is what I will do w/ them next time. I think a great twist would be to add maybe 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of crushed pepper flakes in there as well...believe me, they are wonderful as is, just thinking out loud, lol. Note that these do not taste like the jarred ones @ the store...they are different, but better! This is a definite keeper that I will make often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I am basing this review at the moment on how easy these are to make and on how gorgeous my 2 jars came out....I cant rate taste at the moment as I gave these out as Mother's Day gifts. I used 4 cans of quartered artichokes, 1 1/2 lemons, 4 tblspns of olive oil, salt and pepper, 2 tspns of Italian seasonig and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. They looked so good in the jar, just like the ones in the store. I will update my review as soon as I get the "taste" feedback I need. Thanks for a great recipe.
*5/18/12- got my first "taste" review back from my mom who raved about these artichokes. She tried them last night and said they were perfectly seasoned and tangy. At this point the artichokes have been sitting and marinating for a lil over 2 weeks. I think as they sit the will increase in flavor.*

I've made this recipe more than a dozen times. It's terrific. But now I make it as written but add black and green olives slice in half, about 2 to 3 ounces of jarred roasted pepper, diced, and a bunch of banana peppers. It's to die for.

very good... I put in a splash of white wine vinegar as I thought it needed a little kick.  Will use this recipe from now on and only buy marinated in a pinch.  Sam's Club has a very large jar of plain artichokes for a great price.  When its time for me to open that jar I will definitely make a large marinated jar using this recipe.  thanks

I made these according to the recipe with no changes.   These were far too tart for me and I drink lemon juice.   One other point I didn't care for was that there is just barely enough liquid to coat the artichoke hearts.  Because I wanted to tone down the lemon and add some liquid I added more olive oil and that seemed to work.     They are great on salads and sandwiches. 

This is a great base to work from for an artichoke marinade.   I will make them again but I will use more olive oil and possibly some water.

Really good! They don't usually make it into a dish other than a bowl from which a fork puts them in my mouth. 

One note: measure out 3 Tbsp of the lemon juice. The first batch I made my lemon was apparently really juicy and they were too lemony.

We have enjoined this marinate so much now that we can't eat artichokes any other way! We used frozen artichokes and canola oil, garlic powder and a dash of onion powder. Just makes it faster!

I substituted the Italian seasoning for garlic herb plus seasoning. I found it to give it a more garlicky and salty taste. Worked out well.

Awesome and so much better than expensive store bought! 
2 changes (not to suggest mine was better, but more out of necessity) 
I used my excess evoo that came with a store bought prosciutto&provolone cherry peppers.
Added a pre-seasoned garlic evoo to what I already had with above, and FULLY  marinated it (to the top) with sufficient hearts in another glass jar.  Was a little spicy from pepper evoo, but amazingly delicious for anyone that wants to try it that way.  Garlicky, spicy and loaded with deliciousness!

This recipe is a gem!!  I couldn't believe how it easy it was to make, but how delicious it came out.  

The only thing I changed was I did not add the lemon juice because I was out.   In its place I added 3 Tablespoons of red wine vinegar.  

When I woke up this morning to "taste test" them, needless to say, I almost ate them all.  It is supposed to be my lunch lol.

Super easy!. I put them in a mason jar. In a pinch, use bottled lemon juice and garlic powder.  Still has greats flavor.

I had bought the Sam's Club 33oz jar of whole artichoke hearts to make something for Easter dinner. 2 days before Easter made the marinade exactly by the recipe only adjusting for the amount.  Tried one immediately after shaking.  I see why people wind up eating the whole batch.  This was delicious as written!!!

This is absolutely fantastic.  I marinated the artichoke hearts for a few hours and they came out perfect.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will never buy jarred marinated artichoke hearts again.

Love this recipe, with small changes.  I usually buy largish lemons and feel that 1/2 a lemon gives a lot of tang - and this is from a lemon lover.  I usually cut the artichokes smaller because I love to slather them on top of a pizza.  This recipe is so much better than the jarred already marinated artichokes, IMO.  Will try frozen artichokes soon.

Turned out great. My husband is on a low sodium diet so buying marinated artichokes is out of the question. I left out the salt and used frozen artichokes and it turned out great and the recipe I was making was just like when I made it with on the shelf marinated artichokes.

So good.  The flavors really even out and become best after marinating for 5 days.  I doubled the recipe and it fit well into a Ball jar.
