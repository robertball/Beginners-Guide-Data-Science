Oh my stars this is a GREAT recipe!!!!  I made these wings for a chili cookoff and won peoples choice!! People were asking for the recipe and asking to buy the sauce.  I did do a few things different,  first of all, they were deep fried, then marinated for a short time in the sauce, before grilling them briefly, then rolled them again in the sauce before serving.  I also used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of the apple cider vinegar, and red crushed pepper instead of black pepper.  What a wonderful flavor experience this gave you,  sweet and then spicy!!!  Can't wait to make them again

This recipe is awesome.The key is to putting in fridge overnite.The chicken juice with the boiled mixture helps to thicken the sauce.Otherwise it never really thickens. Ive made this several times, just to get it right.

Not spectacular but good.  We added some red pepper flakes but obviously not enough because no heat came through.  It took a while for the sauce to boil down to thick but once it did, it was better.

My family loved these.  Because I like spicy sweet stuff I added a bit of cayanne pepper to the marinate.  I didn't actually baste them as much as dip the in the sauce and put them back in the oven.  The remaining few minutes I put them on broil to set the glaze.  They were very good.

I just tried this recipe and it was really good.  It had kind of a teriyaki taste to it.  The raspberry glaze was not detectable, though I wish it had been. I will try this one again and add brown sugar and a few crushed peppers to make a raspberry chipolte type glaze. All in all, it was good even as it is written.

You really couldn't taste the raspberry flavor in these at all. I don't think I would make them again.
