This was okay. Kind of a poor man's quick version of Eggs Benedict. My kids ate a bite each and asked for cereal. My husband and I ate most of ours, but didn't much care for the flavor of the soup "hollandaise" sauce. I'll just stick to your typical Eggs Benedict. Thanks, anyway. I'm one of those proud Campbells condensed soup lovers, too.

This is great for when you want a cooked breakfast but are pushed for time. The only thing I did differently was to double up on the bacon, and season with freshly-ground pepper. Thanks, Kelly!

Great Idea, so easy.  A twist on a common meal to make it new.  I used White country gravy on top, we like the peppery tasts in that.

This is great!  Made this for myself, but then added a little black pepper, chili powder and grated cheese to the leftover sauce.  I used it with some grilled chicken later and it completely revived an otherwise boring meal!
