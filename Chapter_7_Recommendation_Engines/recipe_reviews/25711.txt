This is the BEST chili I have ever had!  I have made it twice now in the past two weeks!  Eventhough the flavor of the first batch tasted great, it was a bit too spicy for my palate.  Therefore, the second batch I only used one habenero and one annaheim pepper.  I found that when I reduced the peppers, the chili is just a bit too sweet. I will 1/2 the brown sugar the recipe calls for the next time I make it with less peppers.  Also, the first time, I didn't have a dark beer on hand and used a domestic beer.  The second time, I used New Castle and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  As others have suggested, I used 2 tablespoons of wasabi instead of the 1 that it calls for which really pumps up the deliciousness of the recipe!  I served this last batch with some friends, topped with cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and slices of warm french bread. Fifteen minutes later, there wasn't a drop left!

This chili is amazing!  First of all, my wife hates chili, ooops, I meant Hates chili with a capital 'H.'  I had some time one day to pull this together, and not only did I love it, but she did too.  With the beer and coffee, it adds some original taste that makes the chili completely unique.  It does take a little time to prepare for the first time, but it was well worth it.

This is the best chili I've ever tasted and I have tasted A LOT of chili. When making this recipe, I was a little concerned about how much chili powder was in the recipe, but it turned out to be just the right amount when blended with all the other spices and chili peppers. My health-conscious boyfriend did the shopping for this recipe and he substituted the spicy italian sausages with spicy turkey sausages and ground beef with ground turkey making this recipe delicious AND extra healthy. I used guiness for the dark beer, which my roommate was not too thrilled about since I stole one of his bottles, but he raved about the chili afterwards.  Thanks Aaron for sharing the recipe.

This chili was the perfect warmer-upper comfort food during the last two big power outages here in the Seattle area. I made it on a propane camp stove, and since I couldn't get to the store, I substituted for some of the ingredients with what we had on hand (canned roasted California chiles instead of fresh chiles, sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy, chicken instead of beef, a smaller amount of cayenne instead of chili powder). Instead of prepared wasabi, which is expensive and not something I keep on hand, I mixed a tablespoon of prepared horseradish with a pinch of two of turmeric (virtually the same thing, taste-tested and approved by my Japanese daughter-in-law). Now the only question is: If I make it again, will the power stay on?

Very flavorful but a little on the greasy side. I would sugguest you drain the fat/grease from the pot after the meat and sausage is done cooking. Will try that next time and see if it comes out better. Thanks for the recipe

This chili rocks!  The wasabi, sausage, and multiple kinds of peppers really add depth of flavor.  I always substitute ground beef with 2 cups of texturized vegetable protein (TVP) to make it a little healthier (add 2 extra cups of liquid if you try this).  The beer I used was perfect for the recipe, too: Alaskan Brewery's Smoked Porter - they smoke the malt with alderwood before brewing...try it if you can find it.  This will be added to my growing arsenal of awesome chili recipes from allrecipes...thanks Aaron! Deee--LISH

This Chili is the BEST!  My family loved it and asked for extra helpings!  Follow the recipe as written - don't leave anything out - the dark beer and wasabi paste is a must! Nice and spicy with a hint of sweet which is exactly how we like our chili.

This is a great chili but to sweet and soupy for me.  Next time Iâ€™ll leave out the sugar, drain the cans of beans and use a full pound of Italian sausage and see how it is then.

I make this every year for Superbowl and many other times throughout the year. Everyone I know LOVES it. Even if they think they make the best chili, they still agree that this recipe is better. Amazing flavor - even my spice hating kids will eat it!

I read this recipe has won contests and it did for me too!!  I made a couple of alterations: added cubed sirloin, one can each of kidney beans, black beans and pinto beans, and 1/4 c bittersweet chocolate.  I named it "Triple Threat Throwdown Chili" (3 kinds of meat, 3 kinds of beans and 3 kinds of peppers).  I entered it into a contest where there were 20 entries and won first place for the chili and first place for the name!  It is really good - wonderful depth of flavor.  You should try it and don't be afraid of the peppers - they add lots of flavor.

I have had a lot of chili in my time, and this is by far the best I've ever had.  Cook it just like the recipe says.  It's twice as good the next day! (I use Guiness).  I don't just throw out 5 star ratings.

I am the chef at a sports bar and grill in Dania Beach, Florida. My clientele consists not only of local residents but tourists from around the world. I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  I used Guiness as the beer and coffee liqueur instead of coffee. I played around with the spices and the end result was a hit and sold out

Although it takes some time coming up with the ingredients-coffee, wasabi paste, dark beer, it is well worth the effort! i used chicken sausage and ground chicken, bought a black coffee a tim hortons, used my wasabi from sushi and bought 1 can of rickards dark beer. Then put it all together as per instructions-delicious!!

Biggest hit at the Super Bowl party.  I used jalapeno and serrano peppers and some hot sausage along with "not so hot". My husband thought it was a little too sweet so maybe I'll back off on the sugar, but everyone else thought it was perfect. It is the only chili I will make from now on.

I can't count how many times we've made this chili! We make a large stock pot of this recipe each fall and freeze it in dinner-sized quantities so we can pull it out on the coldest winter days. If you like hot chili this recipe is for you. This stuff will make your face melt, but in such a good way! The recipe has depth of flavor. It is just sweet enough. The coffee and dark beer makes it taste earthy. So many recipes need to be tweaked, but for this one I wouldn't change a thing. Enjoy!

Don't be afraid of the ingredients or the complexity. This one is worth the time! I have cooked several great chili recipes off of this site, but this one takes the cake. So flavorful with just the right amount of spiciness. The Wasabi is barely noticeable, and people who do not like Wasabi will still love this chili. It will last for about a week and gets even better with age.

This was one of the best batches of chili I have ever had.  The only alteration I made was to use an additional can of tomatoes (fire roasted) instead of the beans.  The flavors of this chili were amazing!!!!

Good recipe I suppose, but I don't know how it won the chili throwdown.  I suspect bribery or some other foul play.

I really appreciate that everyone posts recipes so I hate to give a bad review especially when this recipe had an overwhelming amount of great reviews...but we really really didn't like this chili at all.  I made it for a neighborhood chili cookoff that I have won in the past with my own recipe.
Wasn't sure how it would turn out so I made it the day before and good thing because we didn't like the taste at all.  Maybe it was the coffee or maybe it had way too much tomato paste.  Oddly every review said it had depth of flavor but we didn't get that at all...it was just overly tomato pasty tasting.  The day of the cookoff I made a batch of my own chili recipe and brought both to the cookoff.  Everyone loved our normal recipe but not one person liked the washabinaro recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except we couldn't find habaneros.

Very good, but spicy.  I cut down the spice tremendously:  used sweet peppers instead of the peppers called for, halved the wasabi and cayenne, and bf was still remarking it was hot. We aren't fans of tremendously spicy food--if you love spicy, I'd tell you to go for it--it just wouldn't have worked for us at that level of spiciness.   I also left out the coffee (I can't stand it in anything) but followed the rest of the recipe.  This makes a ton of chili--no way it's just 8 servings!  It filled up my large crock pot and we have a lot leftover.  I put the chili in this morning and let it cook on high for 4 hours, which was a perfect time frame.  Thanks for the unusual chili recipe!

Exceptionally delicious.  Other than habanero, I am going to leave in seeds to give a bit more spice.  Also, serve over REAL rice, even better.

This recipe is awesome!  I added 1/4 cup of masa flour at the end and substituted a jalepeno pepper for the serrano pepper as my market did not offer serrano peppers.

Seems to have endless amounts of ingredients, but everything melded together nicely. It is a good, hardy chili.

This was the first time I actually made chili and boyfriend ended up LOVING this and said it was the best chili he has ever had!  He really likes thick and chunky chili so I didn't add the broth and only put 2.5 cups of tomato sauce in it and no paste because it ended up perfect in the end.  I put in Chocolate Porter Ale since it was the only dark beer I had.  Also I just put in a cube of a 99% chocolate bar instead of the cocoa powder.  I didn't add the coffee because bf doesn't like coffee and was worried it might be to much...but I may have to try it next time! Instead of habinaros, I put in 5 arbol chilis instead.

This is the best chili I have ever had, I brought it to a super bowl party last year and every body had to have the recipe. I added red and green peppers to my ground meat while I was cooking it and that's just because that's what I like in my chili but it would have been just as awesome with out them though.

Made this for a surprise 18th birthday party for my daughter.  Huge hit!!!  Followed the recipe in the sense that I measured everything out according to what the recipe said but decided along the way as to how much beef broth, beer etc I wanted to add.  I rarely follow a recipe to the letter.  Did not add the peppers, as the wasabi and chili powder were enough.

This is the only chili I will ever make. Ever.    I've made it a few times and it's always amazing.  I've used sweet and hot sausage, ground turkey instead of beef, and I always find a different beer to vary the flavor a little, but no matter how I make it I'm literally left speechless.    I personally like to use less spicy peppers (i.e. jalapeÃ±os and pablanos instead of habaneros), but there's still a good spice due to the wasabi and other spices.    This recipe does make a lot, but I think it's even better reheated, so don't worry about leftovers.    This is chili you will dream about.  Make it.  Now!

Soooo good...I left out the beer and sausage because I didn't have them.  I also didn't have the peppers and used 2 green bell peppers instead. The first time I used all the brown sugar that was called for, but found it too sweet. The 2nd time I only used 1 table spoon and it was just right.  I also didn't have wasabi.  I made alot of alterations, but it turned out great!  It's a great base recipe for chili.

Though it takes more expense and preparation than some, this is my new favorite chili recipe. I was going to take it to a cook-off but got there too late to enter. :( Don't be afraid to add all the "hot" ingredients -- cayenne, habaneros, wasabi. Unless you have a sensitive, bland tastes, this moderately spicy chili won't be too hot for you. I'm sort of a middle-of-the-road hotness person myself (always get "medium" in the salsa aisle) and it was just fine. I liked all the different flavors in it. I will say that after it simmered awhile the flavors were less discernible, which kind of disappointed me. But I'm about to put all the ingredients on my shopping list again so we can make it again! Oh, and seriously, you HAVE to drain the fat after cooking the meat ... can't imagine how greasy the chili would be if you didn't.

This chili was very good!  Different from my everyday chili!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and a light beer to cut down on calories.  I also added a half of a red bell pepper.  It was delicious!  I omitted one can of beans and substitute one can of black beans for one can of kidney.  Next time I will use 3 cans, my children felt it was too soupy, but that could be why.  Will definitely make again.

This is the best chili recipe EVER!! I've made it about 20 times now, and have adjusted the proportions a little because we like it really spicy.  I use chili manzano when it's available (otherwise, chiles amarillos, habaneros or even jalapenos work well) and I eliminate the chili powder completely (it seems to give a bitter flavor) and substitute with additional Cayenne pepper.  I use 10 Anaheim peppers instead of 2 (these are not spicy) and use a few teaspoons of Better than Bullion beef stock rather than buying the canned stock.  It always comes out great!  Freezes beautifully and I always stock the freezer with this when it's cold outside.

The wasabi taste was REALLY overpowering.. Like, to the point where my husband and I who never waste food, had to throw the entire pot out.  I guess you have to be a wasabi lover to enjoy this recipe. I spent about $30 making this chili and I suspect that without the wasabi, it would have been at least edible, if not down right good.  But alas, I have to give it one star.

Delicious!  It has so many subtle flavors.  I had my guests guess the three unusual chili ingredients: wasabi, coffee, and beer.  No one got any of them right!

I didn't change anything about this recipe, which is almost a first for me.  I personally did not care for this.  My husband made no comments while eating it.  He usually raves about everything I cook.  I thought it smelled really "odd" while it was cooking and in my bowl.  It had a strange flavor too.  I loved everything I put into it, so I'm very surprised I didn't really like the chili.  Sorry, but this isn't the recipe for me.

THIS CHILI IS AWESOME!  I WON A CHILI COOK OFF USING IT.  I live in MN and we don't like things too spicy so I left out the wasabe paste.  I also used 3 different kinds of beans (1 can kidney, 1 can black beans and 1 can of honey baked).  I also skipped the hot peppers and just added a little extra anaheim.  Again, I live in MN and we think ketchup is spicy.  However, I felt it still had just the right kick!  :)  Thanks for the bizarre, yet great recipe!

Haven't made chili in years and needed to find a recipe that would feed a lot of people.  This recipe is so delicious and was perfect!  I made it without a habanero and wasabi paste...didn't have them on hand, but it didn't matter.  I only added 2 Tbl. (packed) brown sugar instead of the 1/4 cup.  After reading a review that it was a bit sweet, I thought less would be more.  I made it with mild sausage, again that is what I had on hand. I would use mild sausage again next time around.  I drained the meat once it was browned and used the oil from it to brown the peppers.  I didn't want to try using the additional 2 Tbl. of oil the recipe called for, worried it would be too greasy as one review mentioned.  This must of helped because it wasn't greasy at all. I used 4 cans of beans, didn't drain the first one but drained the other three.  This must of helped with it not turning out soupy and we liked the extra beans.  I don't think I would do it any different in the future.  It had just the right amount of kick and a perfect consistancy.  If I was looking to make a hot & spicy chili, I would follow the recipe and use spicy sausage, wasabi paste and a habanero.  This turned out wonderful, especially since I was making it for company and I received so many great comments.

The list of ingredients made me want to try it but I didn't want to make a batch and it be too hot.  A fund raising Chili Cook-off at work was a wonderful reason to make it.  I couldn't find the Anaheim peppers so I substituted a Jalapeno pepper an used only one and followed everything else.  It was a big hit and won.  I even ran out before the 1-hour contest was over.  Now people want me to make the chili for the Christmas party.  But since that is tomorrow it won't be happening since some of the ingredients are things you would have at home.  Well worth the effort.

Another chili cook-off winner from this recipe!  The sweet flavor pulls you in and the spicy bite comes a few moments later - everyone couldn't get enough!  Definitely add the brown sugar gradually depending on how sweet you want it to be, and I also added a square of baker's chocolate at the end - wonderful!

I love chili, and this recipe was great! I made it for some friends and got great reviews. I did think it was too sweet though, and I will significantly reduce the brown sugar next time. I also drained the juice from the last two cans of beans when I made it because I like thick chili, and it worked out well.

Very good recipe! Unfortunately, didn't have a lot of the ingredients here in Israel, so I made this one with plenty of changes, e.g. only 1 can of red beans instead of 3 cans kidney beans. Couldn't find wasabi- though next time I'll make sure I have since I bet this makes up the whole dish- nor any of the fresh chili peppers, so used only chili powder and black pepper. Didn't use beef broth but increased the amount of beer... All in all, loved it, family loved it, will definitely make this again and I think it's a good recipe to experiment with. Thanks!

Sorry, but we didn't care for this one at all.  We were excited to try it, as we love chili and saw that this one was unusual and yet still got good rating.  Unfortunatley, we found its flavor was not good, and had a weird, unpleasant aftertaste.  We were very disappointed after all the hard work to prepare it.  We took it to a chili cook-off and received only one vote.  I've found other chili recipes on this site that are much better -- wouldn't make this one again.

This is absolutely, postively, by far, without a doubt, the BEST chili I have ever had!  The reason I love it is because it does not taste like chili from a can, it is like a gourmet chili stew, so delicious, complex flavor!!!  It has a nice heat to it without being too spicy.   I always leave out the habanero because I cannot find them, and I do not think it needs it anyway.  I use 1 TBSP of wasabi powder that comes in a little can next to the Asian foods because I cannot find paste and it will last forever in the pantry.  I also drain the last 2 cans of beans because it has enough liquid at that point.  I also take about 1/2 to 3/4 of one of those cans of beans, and mash them with a potato masher, this helps thicken it some more.    PEPPERS...According to a book of mine, anaheim peppers offer medium heat, serrano are hot, and habanero have a searing heat.

I made this for our church's chili cookoff solely because the ingredient list was so crazy.  I won the coveted "Golden Ladle" beating out about 20 other entries.  Great recipe!  The only changes I made are to add more garlic and wasabi.  Next time, I'll add one can of drained black beans since my batch came out less thick than I like.

This was good, but not stellar. I used it in a chili cook off at work, did not win but plenty of people ate it!  Maybe too hot for the general public. I did like the depth of flavor but will keep searching for the "perfect" chili recipe.

Easily the best chili I've ever eaten.  Served it to guests just last night and they agreed.  The flavor is really balanced and it is a wonderful combination of hot...though not scalding...spicy and mild.  It is my new favorite.

Ummmmm yummie! instead of using hamburger I cut up a whole pre-cooked and seasoned tri-tip!  It was excellent and everyone wanted the recipe. I only used 1/2 habanero...didn't want to make it too hot for the guests! It's my new fav chili!

This chili was the best I've ever tasted.  I'm not a chili fan.  Made it at the request of my husband.  The consistency and flavor was awesome.  Next time I will cut back on the heat (peppers).  It was a bit too spicy for me.  Great recipe!

This chili was amazing!!! My friend actually sent me this recipe as I am the chili maker of the group! I made this and everyone loved it! I used Blue Moon beer and I think it worked out very well. I normally add sourcream to a bowl of chili but that was not a good mix with the wasabi. I will be making this at my chili night!

I cooked this recipe for 50 people.  LOVED this chili....seriously the best raves I have ever received for a chili.  I used about half the peppers because I had to please a lot of people (still spicy but for my own taste...I would 3/4 of the amount of pepper in the receipe)  Also I added a variety of beans, more tomatoes, roasted red peppers and a bit more meat.  This thickened it up a bit.  I cooked it for a very long time to meld the flavors together.  BEST chili ever.  Not a drop was left.....good deal.  P.S.  If you like to lighten your chili, serve it over rice with a grated cheese topping and some sliced green onions.  It is good.  Sour cream is also a good condiment to add.  Just your own personal tastes.

I normally never rate or review recipes, but I just had to on this one. This is BY FAR the best chili I have ever made. For the beer I used Shiner Bock Black and added an extra tablespoon of wasabi like the other reviewers suggested. This is a must try recipe with an endless array of flavors!

LOVE this recipe!  I've made it several times now, and it just gets better every time.  Half of the fun is explaining to people that you make it with coffee, beer, and wasabi paste.  Their eyes are always like saucers!  The only significant change I end up making is adding a third can of tomato paste every time.  I like my chili thick, and 3 cans of tom paste makes it exactly how I like it.

This probably isn't the most helpful of reviews since I don't remember the exact modifications I made to the recipe to replace ingredients I didn't have on hand.   But I wanted to say that it was very good.  The substitutions I made were very minor and didn't effect the overall qualities of the recipe.  The only major modification was to tone down the spices a bit.  I like things zesty, even with a very little bite, but not so much that I have to stop and sip milk in between mouthfuls.

WhenI first looked at the recipe I thought hungry/drinking college kids throwing whatever was handy in a pot, lol!! To my suprise this is a fantastic chili.  I did not want to run to the store so I used two bags of pinto beans I'd cooked and frozen and 1 can of refried beans to make it thick(more like a con carne)...then I used one can of kidney beans at the end.  We topped with cheddar and green onions...a keeper and a great Fall/Tailgating recipe.

This is my go-to chili recipe. Now on year four and batch number 20 or so, I have a few unique tips to add. #1 - Add a tablespoon of strong mustard powder (can't go wrong with Colman's). Depending on how much of a kick you're looking for, this can be in addition to doubling the wasabi powder as other reviewers have suggested or as an alternative to that extra tablespoon of wasabi. 

#2 - Also, this recipe has no shortage of ingredients to begin with, but try adding a cup of cider (or even mulled cider) to the pot. It adds a bit of tartness and a bit of sweetness and is a wonderful, comforting complement to the chili, particularly when eating it on cold day.

I have to say, that I am bit particular about my chili.  I don't just put anything into it. So, when I saw this recipe I thought it sounded sooo good.  I was right. It is very good!
I started out by looking for a really good cornbread recipe, I found Jalapeno Cornbread, read the reviews and one of them mentioned this Chili. That sounded so very warming, and tasty that I checked out the chili recipe. 
Many  ingredients are in it that I would never have thought of, I knew when I saw it that it would be worth it to make it.
I have already made Jalapeno Cornbread twice now, we love it! Just got done making the chili and I know my hubby is looking forward to this dish. He's not home yet, but, he knows what I was making today.

The only cavaet I would add is to WEAR GLOVES WHILE HANDLING THESE HOT PEPPERS! I wore them while making the cornbread, but, didn't think I needed to for the chili.
Big mistake, but, is all better now.  The stuff that burns in inside the pepper, its the ribs and seeds.  Always wear gloves while handling them. If you forget and then you rub your eyes(me), nose or anything like that. Do not drink water, it will make it worse. Drink milk or other dairy product. Put it on if necessary, use Aloe Vera it will help with the burning.
You can rub your hands with vegetable oil after you are done cutting the peppers--that will help with not getting it on other things.   Do not rub your eyes especially, you will have to let them burn. Mine went away within 30 min. I did

We made this chili for a campout this weekend. It was a hit! I added a little extra beef and sausage because I like my chili really meaty. We also couldn't find a habanero at the store, so we used 3 jalapenos, 2 serranos, and the anaheim chile peppers. It wasn't too hot, but had a nice spiciness to it. I love spicy food, so I'd like to try this with the habanero next time. I was also very surprised that you couldn't really taste the wasabi much. So if you're not a fan of wasabi, try this anyway! It's really delicious! We used Smithwick's as the dark beer. Yum.

This chili is so-so. I am not sure if I will make again. It has a lot of ingredients and takes a long time to prepare. If time is on your side then try it.

Probably the best chili I've ever made or we've eaten. Made a few changes. My wife doesn't like spicy chili so I didn't put any peppers or wasabi paste in it. I also went about 1/2 on the other spices. I used 2lbs of good ground beef instead of Italian sausage and drained off all the grease after browning the meat. Our family raved about it and we will make it for years to come.

The flavor of this chili cannot be beat.  I was tempted to mess with it, but I decided to be more or less true to the recipe and I was surprised at the perfect flavor this chili had.  I reduced the sugar to 2 Tablespoons, but I think it was almost the same as quarter cup.  I used 2 pounds of top round roast cubed and I browned it with a coating of flour mixed with fresh ground pepper and garlic salt.  I took out the habanero and used just the anaheims and one serrano.  The spiciness was then relatively mellow.  I didn't have any oregano.  I agree with a reviewer that said it was a little too soupy, but I served it with the Honey Cornbread recipe and honestly both my husband and I were in heaven.

Our absolute favorite chili and a family favorite.  Everyone always wants the recipe.  Don't be worried that it will be too spicy (with the all the peppers and the wasabi) because it comes out just right.  I add just a little extra brown sugar to taste at the end to make sure its just right.

This recipe is unreal... SO DELICIOUS!! Used ground turkey and turkey sausage instead of beef, and Yuengling Lager for the beer. Takes awhile to make but it is totally worth the wait. My boyfriend liked it better than his Mom's chili (HUGE compliment, she is an AMAZING cook!) THANKS!

I also won a chili contest with this recipe!  Beat out 16 others!  I had to take out the sugar though, way too sweet.  Also used chuck roast instead of ground beef, took out all the beans but added a can of black beans (rinsed) and frozen corn at the end.  Excellent!

THIS CAME OUT REALLY GOOD, I HAD TO MAKE A FEW CHANGES DUE TO WHAT I HAD ON HAND, NOTHING MAJOR.  THE ONLY THING I'D CHANGE NEXT TIME IS LESS BROWN SUGAR, 1/4 CUP MADE IT TOO SWEET FOR OUR TASTE, AND I USED EXTRA CAYENNE AND GARLIC.

Yum-o! There are so many fun flavors, your mouth can't get bored.  Spicy enough to satisfy the grown-ups, yet the kids (12 & 5) never complained about the heat.  A constant request in my house.  Follow to the "T" & it'll do you right every time!  Top w/shredded cheese & a dallop of sour cream.  Yum-o!

This thick chili has a wonderful medly of spicyness that work in tandem to give a long lasting taste that is only rarely overpowering.  The beer does lend a lot to the dish and the wasabi can be forgotten without much notice.  Enjoy with a good dry cornbread.

I've always prided myself on my own chili recipe but stumbled across this and was intrigued.  Coffee?  Brown Sugar? Wasabi?  Needless to say my curiosity got the best of me and I made it, confidently doubling the recipe.  No Serranos were available so I substituted a few nicely roasted jalapenos.  I also used a mix of dark red, light red and pinto beans.
The results and reviews were outstanding.  The complex layers of flavor worked really well. This is a keeper recipe and has displaced my own recipe as my go-to chili. Believe me - that speaks volumes for just how durned good this is.

Delicious!! Only thing I did was use mild sausage and substituted the Serrano peppers for Jalapenos b/c I was afraid it would be too spicy for some of us. I can't tolerate too much spice, but this was a perfect blend of sweet and spicy.

Made this as-is several weeks ago, and it was such a hit. We loved this. Another cold spell arrived, and when it came to the decision of chili or stew, we're having chili tonight! There was no debate. This recipe rocks. Don't be afraid of all the peppers. For the amount this recipe makes, the spice is just right. Serve with a hot pan of cornbread, and watch it get eaten up! Also freezes pretty well. Makes a nice lunch on a cold day at the office!

I don't like chili but my husband does.  He really enjoyed this recipe but for those chili neophytes beware....PLEASE use gloves when cutting the peppers!!  Yes, I know...I'm an idiot.  I had a nice milk + baking soda mixture on my hands for a few hours.  Great recipe though....I used 2 habaneros and 2 jalapenos for a lack of the other peppers at my store.  I used 1/2 cup coffee and 1/2 cup Kahlua.  Seemed to work.

I liked it, but I tasted the coffee and the port that I used, and that bothered me a little bit. I will try it again with a few alterations ... maybe more tomatoes, weaker coffee and slightly lighter brew.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The beer, coffee, and wasabi are consumed within the chil.  A bit on the sweet side cuz of the sugar, but expected that.  Is it the best I've ever made?  No, due to the sweetness.  But pretty good, I'll make it again.

Good but I will make some changes if I ever make it again. The sausage and the sugar overpowered everything else. The sausage gave it a spaghetti sauce taste. I had to add some vinegar after tasting it and thought it was too sweet. I like beer in chili but couldn't taste it over the sugar and sausage. I didn't notice the coffee. There was a good taste coming through though and it was probably the wasabi and chilies. I may try it again but use pork instead of sausage and not add any sugar unless I think it needs it at the end.

I cut out the Serrano and Habanero peppers and added more Wasabi to match our (my wife and I) tastes. I like to  put it all in a slow cooker for about 6 hrs. on low.  Since ground bison is readily available around here at pretty much the same price as beef, we use it instead, it makes it less greasy. I also like to drain and rinse the beans when I make this.  We've made this recipe quite a few times since finding it and it's great each time.

Loved it! could be the best chili i ever had, and definitely the best i ever made! Coffee and beer???.....genius!!!!. I used horseradish instead of wasabi stuff... (the wasabi paste i looked at had horseradish listed as its main ingredient so i didn't bother to spend 3 bucks on it). Also I couldn't find a habanero so i used a plain ole jalapeno. anyway, turned out amazing!!!

Very complex flavors. I've had multiple people remark that it's the best chili they've had. Didn't add the wasabi or all of the peppers, and it was still spicy. I always substitute ground turkey and it's still sooo flavorful.

Best chili ever! I added more tomatoes and beans than the recipe called for to make it thicker. Also added some cocoa powder and exluded the wasabi. It is really fun to cook - just don't touch your eyes/face after chopping the peppers!

I was excited to make this because of all the great reviews. I really needed to put it in the crockpot for timing reasons....and I'm wondering if the stovetop cooking would have made it better.  I think it's pretty good but there are a couple of things that I will change next time.   First...the beer taste is almost alittle too strong (I had it in the crockpot for 4 hours). Perhaps the stovetop would've cooked it off more.  I used a dark beer...so I may not use that next time.  Also, I think that the corriander gives it a sweet taste.  I added the brown sugar too so I might cut back.   Because we have 4 little ones, I used 2 jalapeno's (had them on hand from making salsa) and 1 Anaheim chili.  It gave us a great heat that the kids liked as well.  I also used the Italian sausage but used a roasted red pepper and carmalized onion one because I couldn't find the hot... I loved the idea of the wasabi! My husband LOVES this chili. He says it has great flavor. He likes the beer flavor and doesn't think it's too much. Overall, we really enjoyed this chili and I will definetly make it again.  I think it was a little soupy but after it sat off the heat it came together nicely. One other thing... I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 1 of black beans. I drained the last 2 because of the liquidy of the chili. It is a little chunky...so if you like your chili like that then you'll love it. I put some aside and used my immersion blender pureed it a bit because my daughter doesn't like chunks

This chili was very rich.  It took second in a local chili cookoff.  I did make a few slight changes, but they were of little consequence.  I love the added flavor of the wasabi!

I made this recipe just as presented except I used hot horseradish and tumeric instead of wasabi. This is a terrific recipe; a bit of a bite to it, but does not burn or cause a sweat... I like the hint of sweetness with my bite of pepper.  Very nice depth of flavor to the broth.

WOW! Delicious flavor! I used horseradish instead of wasabi as one cook recommended and ground turkey instead of ground beef. I used 1/2 the cayenne and cut down on the number of peppers I used for fear that it would be too spicy, but I wish I had added them all. The recipe would be perfect with all the spice called for; the turkey and sausage worked wonderfully together.

Just ok for me. It was really good chili, but I'm torn on this recipe because of the multitude of ingredients. Honestly, the wasabi goes undetected. I know of many chili recipes with FAR fewer ingredients (and cheaper ones, at that!) that are just as good, if not better, than this one. But it's not a bad chili.

I always enjoy making a new chili recipe and this one sounded unique. I love a brothier chili with lots of chunks of tomato, so, I doubled the tomatoes & broth. I put the broth, beer & coffee into a crock pot, then added the tomato paste and whisked to a smooth consistency. I halved the amount of chili powder and sugar in fear of it being too spicey or too sweet. I added all the spices, the onions and the peppers (2 jalapenos & 1 serrano) which I did not sautee first because they would soften all day in the crock pot. Browned and drained the fat from the meat and added that and cooked on low for 8 hours in the crock pot. It was very good! You could pick up the flavor of the beer and a subtle coffee flavor (even though my coffee was not "strong" brewed) and I liked it, as did my husband! There was a TON of chili, so, I froze some for "Chili Dog Casserole" from this site for another time. Thanks! We will make this again!

Made this for a chili cook off. I stayed with the recipe except I went with 1 1/2 cups of coffee, extra hot sauce and drained the beans. I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup and still found it a little too sweet. Next time will try the all hamburger thing, a couple more habaneros and some more hot sauce. I love mine with a kick. I won the best overall chili with this recipe...but will definitely go for more kick next time. It's a good starting point to add your own tweaks!

I have won several chili cookoffs with this little gem. I stick to the recipe mostly, but I do usually omit the habaneros and sometimes substitue a can or two of great northern white beans for the kidney beans just because I find them more tender. I used a smoked porter for the beer the first time but lately have just been using a standard red ale with a drop of liquid smoke mixed in. I find the flavor to be almost identical. Also I don't saute' the peppers, I just puree them and mix it in. I have yet to meet anyone who does not love this chili.

My mom passed on a tomato-based chili recipe that I would have sworn was the` best chili ever.... until I tasted this recipe. Since my family and I disagree on the spiciness of the recipe, next time I will use less chilis, but the actual flavor...  mmmmmmmmmm. I even forwarded this recipe to my girlfriend, who's husband is a chili "connousieur" and even he raved about this recipe.

I just finished making this chili, adjusted for four(4), and it is truly outstanding. 

I made only minor adjustments...,substitued 1/2 inch cubes of top round beef for the ground beef, and a chorizo sausage for one of the hot Italian sausages, a tiny bit less sugar, elephant garlic instead of regular garlic, moderately more wasabi, and substituted a can of chili beans for one of the cans of kidney beans, also added a hint of cilantro and used Negro Modelo dark beer and Starbucks strong coffee.

Can't wait for dinnerand will serve with white rice and topped with sour cream and some fresh cilantro.

I just made this the other night. It was good. I used as german beer which was delicious. The first night, it was too spicy but the second it was perfect. I also made cornbread to go with it,  what a as a great addition!  Just remember when cutting habs, you should use gloves!! OUCH! I used one hab, one jala, and a serrano. I also love chipoltes and so added a tsp of chipolte chili powder as well. Gave it a nice smokey flavor. When you eat it the flavors come in as phases. First, you get this wonderful sweet meatly flavor.  Then, wow you are with a lot of spice! I did cut back the sugar but I will def add the amount recommended. Def you shoud try it just make it to you taste!

Ok - yum. I live in a house that loves spicy food - so this one hit the mark. The beer and coffee add a really interesting flavor (I used Uff-Da Bock) and the wasabi adds a different kind of "spice" to the chili. My only alterations were to nix the beef broth (I didn't think it was necessary/ran out of room in my pot!) and couldn't find exactly the right peppers. I had to go with poblanos and a jalapeno. Very yummy. The only thing I would change is more tomatoes- maybe throw in a can of stewed tomatoes. Besides that personal preference this was a definite 5 star recipe!

Really solid recipe...going on reviews, I left out the beef broth to avoid soupiness, and I think that was a good choice. I used Guiness for the beer. Next time, I will omit the sausage - it made it a little too gumbo-y for my tastes, and I will cut the sugar in half. Also, I mistakenly used Hazelnut coffee, and next time I'll be sure that I grab the correct coffee...it was in interesting layer of taste but not something I'd want every time. 
Oh, one more thing, to the onions and garlic at the beginning I also added two bell peppers, because I can't have chili without bell peppers. 

Thanks, great recipe!

This chili was outstanding! Had it for a party last night and everyone raved and wanted to know what was in it! My favorite recipe so far for chili. Was going to make it again today but I didn't have any peppers left. Had to use chili peppers and jalepenos and annaheim peppers because They didn't have habaneros or serrono peppers at the store. Also used half the amount of sugar. Will make this from now on! Thanks so much for sharing!

My girlfriend and I made this last night and it was amazing.  It had just the right amount of spiciness and the flavors came together great.  The only thing we did different was to omit the coffee and we substituted 2 jalepeno peppers for the habenero because we couldn't find one at the market.  This will definately be the chili I bring to the next company chili cookoff.  Great recipe and definately worth it!!!

This was awesome! We were pleasantly surprised at how great this was and plan on making it again for a chili cook-off. We are sure to win! Update: We did win! We added 3T of wasabi, used guinness, and chocolate flavored coffee for a few of our modifications. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

The flavor is great. I would agree that you should lower the amount of sugar. It's a little bit too sweet for my taste. It also could use more salt, although, I used fresh ground sea salt and maybe that is why it seems to need more.

this was a great chili that could appeal to all walks of life! Great work! I think that the only mod that i might make is to do turkey to appeal to the non beef eaters.  thank you!!!

This is the best chili recipes I have ever tried.  I did mine very close to the recipe except for the preparation.  I browned the meat (I used ground turkey), sausage, garlic, and onion first and then added the rest of the ingredients into my crockpot.  It came out fabulous!

This is THEE best chili I have ever made. I used New Castle Beer, and I also tossed in a square of bakers chocolate.  I could not find an anaheim or serrano pepper, so I substituted 1 jalepno and 1/2 poblano pepper. I also used 1# chuck roast in lieu of ground beef.  It's a keeper!

This recipe has a wonderful complexity of flavors.  The wasabi paste & Italian sausage give it a little kick and is very tasty.  The coffee flavor came through more than I wanted so I will reduce it to 1/2 cup next time. I only used one anaheim pepper, substituted a jalapeno for the habenero pepper, & added extra garlic. I will definitely make it again!

My wife doesn't care to much for ginger so I subed in garlic. The salmon I used was a little over 1.5lbs, there was one small piece left and we had corn on the cob and salad as well. It's so good you better make extra.

I didn't have the various chiles so I used a bit of Zatarain's Creole Seasoning and some red pepper flakes to taste and it turned out really well!  Great consistency!

I always used to pride myself on my chilli - but I have to say this knocks it into a cocked hat. Made recipe exactly as is and it was awesome - won't ever make it another way now. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe deserves a 5 for creativity, orginality, and flavor.  It's fantastic!  However, there are somethings I would recommend. Next time I will use a tsp. of cumin rather than a TBS because cumin has a very distinct flavor  and had too much of a presence for me in this recipe.  I will also omit the italian sausage.  I didn't like the flavor it added to the chili and felt that it was distracting.  Next time I will use 2#s of ground beef. I will also use less peppers out of personal preference.  We had a great time eating it, though!  We served it with fresh corn on the cob and mango margaritas.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this Chili. I did make a few changes... I added celery and a green pepper along w/ the onion.
I used Guiness for the beer and stew meat in place of the ground beef.
I also bought a jar of pre-sliced Jalepeno peppers ( cause I always seem to itch my eyes after cutting fresh peppers...) and anyhow, it turned out great.
 Love it... props.

I followed this exactly and would only make it again by reducing the amount of cumin and coriander. Those are spices I normally would not use in chili - a little bit of it would make it interesting but the amount called for was too much for our taste.

This recipe was awesome. O.K...... I had to tone down the peppers alittle, or my sons wouldn't have eaten it. They can't take the heat! I used the habanero pepper only. It was the mildest of them all. Instead of pork sausage I used turkey sausage instead. I did not have to thicken the sauce at all. The wasabi was a clever idea! This I will make again.

This recipe just won a chili cook off for me (11 total entries).  i added an extra tablespoon of wasabi (2 powder, and 1 fresh grated) and couldn't find any coriander, i also used the whole pound of sausage, but other than that, it was the same.  the heat is good, but it doesn't burn your tongue.

This was amazing!!!!  It was a big hit with the four of us!!  We like spicy food, and were concerned with all of the  peppers, but it was just right for us!  We were amazed at the complexity of flavors and the texture was just rightâ€”-thick and hearty!!  I did substitute ground turkey for the ground beef, and tossed in a full pound of the hot Italian sausage  instead of the 3/4 pound. Best chili I ever made!!!

I tried this because we love wasabi!  I added about 1/2 a pound of stew meat in with the sausage and ground beef.  I didn't have habanero so I substituted a jalapeno.  I used 3 different types of beans; kidney, black and chili.  My beer was Guinness.  It was delicious!!  I always drain and rinse my beans (with the exception of chili beans) but I was still leery about it being too thin based on other reviews.  However, I left the lid off for the last 45 minutes and the consistency was perfect.  Now I have found two chili recipes on this site that it will be difficult to choose between.  Woe is me.

Tried this recipe for something different. We had a chili cookoff at work so figured I'd give it a shot. I was surprised that we won the contest hands down. Great recipe, different ingredient mixture but it was great.

This is a great chili.  I didn't screw with it so I could rate the recipe on it's own merits.  The only thing I will say is that I would cut back on the brown sugar next time, just a tad too much sweetness for our liking.  Also, the wasabi got lost in everything else.  BUT...like I said, this is a great chili recipe!  Actually have plans for a pot this evening.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe at least 40 times.  I love it.  The only changes that I make are the quantity and type of peppers that I use.  If I am feeling crazy, I will use ghost peppers.  

I also started using very lean ground beef.  You can't tell the difference in taste.

It is fun to make and even more fun to eat.

This chili recipe has won me back to back office chili cook-offs.  Naturally I took all the credit, but time to give the credit where it is due.  Thanks.  Great flavor.  I make sure to use a different dark beer each time I make it for a different angle.  I like using a chocolate stout which adds a rich and smooth consistency.   Make sure the coffee used is a STRONG cup to give it a noticeable but it still wont be an overbearing kick.

Kudos to the creator.

The best chili recipe I've ever used. I substituted the brown sugar with a half bar of real dark chocolate but otherwise made exactly as written and it always comes out phenomenal.

This chili is fabulous as written. I have made this at least two dozen times and it is ALWAYS a hit. The heat comes from the chilies (you choose to use). You can lessen the heat if needed and this is easily modified to make to your personal taste/heat. It is definitely a "keeper".

I made a batch of Washabinaros Chili this morning.  I read some of the reviews and followed the trend by omitting the sugar.  The chili turned out awesome.  This will be an armchair quarterback menu item in our house for a long time.

Tina Turner was most accurate......"Simply the BEST!"  I have made this several times now and have made some minor changes, but stick to the core.  I actually prefer a little more spice, so added another habanero, and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper.  Adds a little more kick, but by no means overpowering.  I also throw in a square or two of dark chocolate.  I like what it does to the consistency, and balances out the heat quite nicely.  Customized slightly or not, this chili will remain THE standard going forward.  SUPERB!

Amazing Chili. Unlike some complaints of it being too spicy, I found it to need more spice so I bumped up the peppers. I also used a full pound of spicy sausage since we like our meat :) Oh and I added another TBS of salt which I think upped the flavor. Will definitely be making this again, thank you!

I won our office chili cookoff with this recipe.  I made several changes to save going to the store.  Substitutions:  Course chopped beef shoulder instead of  ground beef, 1 can tomato paste and 2 cans tomatoes, chicken broth instead of beef, black and white beans instead of kidney beans.   I was worried about too much heat, and so left out the habernero and then added the chili mixture a little at a time to get around 2 stars.  I added sugar to taste.  You do not individually taste beer, coffee and wasabi, instead it all melds into a really "full" taste.  While I am not that fond of chili, when tasted next to a bunch of others, it is really obvious that this receipe has very complex flavors.

I thought this chili was very flavorful and spicy. My mother felt that it was too spicy for her, so I added another can of Diced tomatoes and squirted some Ketchup into the chili. This sweetened it up, and toned down the peppers a little. All in all, a fantastic recipe.

I have to say I did not use all the spicy items.. the washabi, the habeneros and it was still quite spicy!  It was a bit runny, I thickened it up with cornstarch.  I will be using beer and coffee in any chili I make in the future.. that was so good!

For the past 2 years I have taken this to my sons high school football end of year bash.  The 1st year, by the time the boys arrived, the coaches had eaten it all...last year they asked my son if I was bringing it again and told the boys in advanced there would be none left...My son said they started asking him back in the summer this year if I was bringing it again!  Excellent chili!!!  Coach and player approved!!!

I was very curious to try this chili because of the variety of ingredients. I really enjoyed the layers of flavor and the heat was perfect, not at all over-powering. Thanks for giving me a spicier option for chili days.

I love this chili I have made it 4-5 times. I always drain the beans as I like a thicker chili. I have also used different peppers when I could not find anaheim or serrano tasted great. I have even used the hillshire farm hot sausage and it was awesome to have those chunks as well as just having the hot ground pork.

As others have stated this is hands down the best chili I have ever made or eaten. The depth of the flavors is amazing.  You are definitely not bored by the third bite.  I had problems finding the right chilis in my small town but I can't imagine it would have been any better.  It was HOT.  If you think you like chili even a little you owe it to yourself to make this one.  You'll never want to eat another variety.

really good chili. it is indeed greasy if you don't drain the meat, so next time i will do that. also i think next time i would use only half the amount of coffee and broth, it was too soupy and i had to use cornstarch to thicken it back up.

This chili has been a staple since I found it here on the site. I rarely make any adjustments at all. It is loved by all of the 5 guys in my life. I leave the lid off so that the chili will thicken just right.

For my family it was too spicy and I didn't even add the habineros!  I couldn't find the wasabi but that's okay since I'm not a huge fan.  With some tweaking I'd make it again.

Made this and brought it into our bi-weekly chili rotation at work. It killed, everyone loved it. Perfect amount of heat mixed with the flavor from the beer and coffee. I had to substitute 2 jalapenos for 1 serrano as I couldn't find any in the grocery store. I did take 2 pieces of advice from previous reviewers and drained most of the fat after browning the meat. I also threw all the peppers into a food processor instead of sauteing them, turned out great.

Was kind of disappointed after reading all the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't taste much different than other chilis I have made.  Good, but not really worth the extra ingredients and time.

The best chili recipe my family and I have ever had. Didn't have some of the exact ingredients, but my substitutions worked out perfectly. I didn't use any of the hot peppers(since my family doesn't like it that hot), used chicken broth instead of beef and used black eyed peas instead of kidney beans. Excellent!!!!

THE BEST CHILI I'VE EVER HAD!!! Everyone loved it! Despite the ingredients, it wasn't very spicy (I think peppers aren't as spicy this time of the year though).  I made mine a vegetarian version and added i can corn, 2 zucchini, 1 tub mushrooms, and 2 red peppers.  I'm taking this to a chili cookoff next month!

Wonderful! Follow the recipe exactly! This one you just can't mess with. Each day the flavors change, if you have some leftover.

I thought that based on the initial smell that the flavor was going to suffer.  That was not result.  I tried this after I made "Boilermaker Chili" and haven't decided which is better.  Both recipes make a great bowl of chili.

I have tried this recipe many times and shared it with many friends.
I do brown the meats first the drain and rinse a little.  Then I put it back on the stove and add the onions and garlic. sautÃ© a few minutes then add other ingredients.  Best chili ever!  My family and friends love it.  Thanks for posting.

The Best Chili ever!  A nice "complex Chili taste" that is addicting.  I followed the recipe exactly with the amounts but I doubled all liquids and all spices because I like more liquid in it.  We loved it.  We will make this often.  Oh yeah, one more thing we did NOT put the habanaros inside.

This Chili is a Hit. Fun to make, and cant stop eating it.  I used half the peppers and double the Wasabi. The taste is above and beyond your average chili.  This chili is King!!!

I've made this recipe twice now with excellent results.  Both times I substituted 2 jalapeÃ±o peppers for the habenero peppers (out of fear), and everyone loved it.  Next time I'll try the habenero peppers because my teenagers would have liked more spice. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Awesome!!  I was scared to make this for my football party, so I made a more standard "Texas chili" as well. This was the one that everyone kept going back for.  The wasabi smells very strong when you first add it- I was having a hard time imagining how this mixture would end up tasing good.  At the end of the cooking time, however, the flavors had mellowed and blended perfectly.  Delicious!

I hate it when people talk about how they won some cook-off with the recipes they find on here.  That said, I won a small chili cook-off with this recipe (one of eight entries). :)  I made it mostly as stated, except:  I couldn't find serrano peppers, and I cooked it in a slow cooker.  I used the full amount of sugar.  I did drain two of the cans of beans, but I really don't think it would have made much of a difference.  The chili was sweet, mildly hot, and well-balanced.  The only thing I'll change when I make it again is that I'll drain the fat from the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.  Easily the best chili I've made.

This is now our favorite chili. It was not as spicy due to no wasabi or habanaro chilis at our local store. Otherwise I completely followed the recipe, used Amber Bock beer. For those who like it spiced down just add a dollop of sour cream. This is a must try recipe for chili lovers!!

Pretty dang freakin good recipe! I read it was a bit sweet, tried it, and believe it or not I put about 2 Tbl spoons of mustard in it and added about 2 teaspoons of black pepper. The coffee adds a nice rich taste to it. Superb.

This chili leaves a good and not unpleasant afterburn. Surprising after the list of peppers.  I thought the sugar was just right, and used a porter for the dark beer.  No single flavor seemed to stand out and they melded together perfectly.  I'll let you know how it ages.

I loved it. It was sweet with some heat. I didn't have all those hot peppers they used in the recipe, or the wasabi paste. It would've been way too hot for us. I just used all the other ingredients and added 2 jalapeno peppers and a few dashes of tobasco sauce. It was perfect!  I can see why it was highly recommended.

WOW! Sweet, hot, spicy and savory all rolled into one!  My husband made this chili because he loved the ingredient list and didn't mind shopping for things like wasabi paste and serrano peppers.  Although it sounded like a little more work than I'm used to for chili, the end result was well worth it!  The only changes we made were to double the meat (both the ground beef and italian sausage) and to use sweet italian sausage instead of the spicy sausage.  Trust me, the serrano and habanero peppers add quite enough heat.  This is definitely a winner!

let me start with WOW!!!
 Firstly, this chili is outstandingly, mindblowingly hot.... until it has simmered away for a few hours and the heat has mellowed into flavour.  And what flavour!! rich, rounded, just outstanding - it makes you want more and more!!

I left out the italian sausage (because I had none) and am unable to get many chili varieties here, so ended up using a few fresh ones (unknown variety) and some paste.  This worked fine.

This chili was a great hit in my house, and I will not hesitate a second to make it again!!

Outstanding.  Chili is my personal experimentation dish when I am in need of therapeutic cooking time, so I've tried a lot of variations.  This is spot on.  Wife found it a bit spicey (and she's not averse to seasoning - this is unabashedly - though not unbearably - hot).  I tend to like to drain my meat after browning to avoid the need to skim, but it wasn't overly greasy even without draining.

This is a good chili. There is some nice heat to the chili without it being too spicy. I don't think the wasabi does a thing to the recipe or the heat in it. I pulled out half of the chili before adding the wasabi paste and then did a taste test. We could not taste the difference between the two. (And I doubled the wasabi.)  I did reduce the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons and I'm glad I did.  Update: After letting the chili sit overnight, we could taste the wasabi. Out of four of us, only one liked the wasabi chili better.

This was pretty good., but way over complicated with too many ingredients  that you don't end up tasting anyway. All you need for a good chile is beans, meat, onions and a couple spices. You can save your money on the rest.

This was the best chili I have ever eaten!  The only ingredient I left out was the habanero pepper, and the chili still retained a lovely 'pepper burn', without being overwhelming.  An oven warm loaf 'Pillsbury Crusty French Loaf' completed a perfect meal.

I made this chili for a cook-off and got an honorable mention. I removed the coffee and used Newcastle beer.  The italian sausage makes this chili a bit on the sweet side.  Next time I'll just use ground pork.

Unbelievable!  This chili was the best I have ever eaten, so much better than my old stand by recipe.  This is the only chili I will ever make again, was a bit spicy but even the grandkids loved it.  Caught my hubby up in middle of the night eating more...A must try, exellent recipe...didn't change a thing.

Wow!  I think this might be the BEST chili I've ever made.  The flavor is wonderful, and no flour or masa corn after taste like chili mixes.  I also reduced the amount of comino to 1/2 TBS and all the flavors blended so well together.  Thanks for a great recipe, this is my chili recipe from now on.

I adore this recipe. I don't follow it to a T but it the best guideline. I followed another users suggestion and through in sweet corn, I increase the wasabi, garlic, and all the spices.  I also can never tell the peppers apart at the grocery store, so I usually jsut start throwing handfuls into a bag and throw it all in the food processor.  To balance out the hot, I use a sweet sausage. I made it with spicy one and I could not eat it.  I usually pick up some colored non hot peppers to add some color to the chili.  Of course my process has absolutely no consistency, but it's amazing every time!

Outstanding chili! I used Yeungling Black and Tan for the beer. I couldn't find Anaheim chilis so I used a jalapeno, a serrano and a habanero. It really wasn't very spicy, which is fine with me! My only complaint is that I don't really taste the wasabi at all... maybe next time I will add a little more.

I made this chili last night.  I didn't know how this was going to turn out as I mixed all of the ingredients together.  I fixed the receipe and didn't really change anything except I forgot to pick up 2 Anaheim peppers and only picked up one so I added more sliced Habanero peppers then called for.  More than enough heat.  I also topped this off with Mexican Cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top served with Texas Toast and scoup tortilla chips.  Great receipe Aaron.

This has been a fun recipe to try. It has a lot of punch, good combination of flavours. Worth a repeat. Some changes: I did need to add cornstarch as another suggested. I had my own hot peppers growing in the garden - even more potent if possible! I have added 2 cups of kernels of corn, to make this into a more complete meal. I didn't have enough brown sugar, so added 2 tbsp of maple syrup (the real Cdn thing). Thanks for posting the recipe!

Exceptional chili! Bold, very flavorful and wonderfully spiced.  Was an amazing hit with our guests.  Goes exceptionally well with traditional southern cornbread.  Will definitely make this again!

And for the chili rookies out there (myself included), make sure you wear gloves while handling the hot peppers, particularly the habanero.

I was very impressed with the original recipe.
However, the second time i didn't have any beer
around the house; after a taste test, the chili
still needed something.  So, i used a little
chocolate and simmered the chili for a while
longer.  If possible, it was even better the
next day.

This recipe looked great but seemed a little extreme to me, so I scaled back on the odd ingredients and loved it! I did not use any beer, dressing, coffee, or wasabi paste. I used lean beef to counter the fatty sausage. It turned out great! Full of flavor, very hearty, not really brothy, but everyone loved it and is asking for it again!

Absolutely delicious!  Perfect blend of hot and flavor.  Followed the recipe and only added an extra habanero trying to add more spice.  Not one person said it was too hot and it won the work chili cook off!  Will definitely make this one again.

Outstanding- though I did used jalapenos and Sambal olek instead of the anaheim and seranno chilies. I just can't take it this hot and had the others on hand. Can always add more to desired level of heat. Served with GF cornbread, this almost GF chili is perfect on a cold night.

Made for a chili contest at work. I loved all the flavors meshing together . The women at work thought it was "too hot". Really it was delicious and the males in the plant loved it. Used Guiness and espresso .  Will make again definitely !

Great chili, but came out with a lot of liquid, I prefer thicker chilis. Next time I will skip the can of broth altogether.

Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil, 1 head of garlic, New Castle Brown Ale for the beer, 15 oz. can of Tri Mix beans (pinto, black and kidney), 6 oz. of tomato paste, 2 Tbl. chili powder, 1 pkg. McCormick Chili Tex Mex Seasoning, 2 squares of Lindt 90% cacao chocolate, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 2 Tbl. ACV, 2 Roasted Poblano Peppers and 12 oz. of green chilis.  I omitted the cumin, Serrano, habanero and brown sugar,

I have to admit I did make quite a few changes. I was making this for a Super Bowl Party and some of my guests didn't care for heat. I left out all the peppers and the wasabi paste. Instead  of three cans of kidney beans, I used one can of chili beans, one can of pinto beans and one can of black beans. I served hot sauce, chopped onions, oyster crackers, shredded cheese, macaroni and sour cream on the side. I also used a whole pound of the Italian sausage (mild). Everyone added his/her own toppings and everyone loved it! Also, I made it a day ahead so that the flavors would blend. Chili is always better the second day.

I found this recipe when I was participating in a Chili Cookoff. This particular cookoff is very specific on what they allow in the chili. For instance "No Beans". I outfield the green chilis and added them to the recipe and used Tri-Tip beef cubes. I placed 6th out of 140 contestants which was awesome for a beginner. This chili has so much flavor and all the reviews were hugely positive. The winning chili tasted like Hormel so if that is what they are looking for then I'll never place higher. This chili is #1 in my book. Serve it over corn chips "Fritos" with a cheddar cheese and sour cream topping.

Spouse loved the flavor, but I wasn't crazy about the labor involved. The flavor is smooth and deep. We left out the wasabi, which we didn't have on hand, and included a little bit of smoked paprika.

I've made this several times now.  It's my go-to recipe for chili.  I don't add the wasabi paste.  It's hot enough for my taste.

This is an excellent chili recipe.  I had to omit the garlic because my husband is a vampire, but it was still delicious.  It makes a lot though!  I think the people who came up with the "servings" must have watched my brother eat when he was a teenager.

Holy smokes is this chili good. I did go with a youngs double chocolate stout for my beer and a cup of HEB's Houston blend cofee. Two of my favorite's. I think they blended well with the spices.  I was concerned with the heat from the peppers so I seeded the hot ones and to be honest, I regret it. There was a just a hint of heat and sweet mix. If I should have at least left the seeds in from the serrano pepper I think it would have been the perfect set up for my taste. I am planning on entering this in the office chili cook off next month and will post the results. All in all a very tasty chili.

This is a very complex chili recipe!  One actually thinks, "what is going on with all these ingredients?"  Is someone just cleaning out their refrigerator?  I think that's what attracted me most to trying it; a few of the ingredients are "off the wall" to what you would expect to find in chili.  I followed the recipe and added all the ingredients, yup, even the wasabi and ALL the peppers.  My taste buds must be dead inside because I only picked up slight "heat" whereas my boyfriend said this one made him sweat.  This is worth the extra work to try a unique chili recipe.  It's good.  It's different.  It's a keeper.

First time making this chile and man it was awesome! I was afraid as some other reviewers had said they didn't like the flavor. I'm sure glad I did decide to make it and pretty much stuck to recipe. I admit I made a few changes, most of which were slight.  
One main change though was I used slow cooker for this. I still browned the meats as per original recipe, but drained grease prior to putting it in the crock pot.
I used two can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of just one can diced can called out. I added 2 chopped bell peppers. I used one Aneheim pepper (mild heat) along with 1 1/2 Serrano and the one jalapeÃ±o, all with seeds included. I added 1/2 tsp of Hatch Chili powder I had as well. I doubled up on the amount of garlic here since I love garlic and always use more of it. I added can each of drained/rinsed white and black beans. That's pretty much it...Oh yea and I used bottle of New Castle  Brown Ale that honestly I had for awhile but was still good.

I made this to the recipe as written with no substitutions.

 I like some heat, but not obnoxiously hot, and this chili started with a subtle sweetness and finished with a nice warm glow on the back of the tongue and the mouth. I had never used habanero peppers before and was a little nervous about their heat. However, if anything, I wish this had a little more kick to it and might up the chili heat content in the future. I found this to be a very easy recipe to make. Even with preparing the chilies it was not at all complicated or involved, as some chili recipes can become. 

The brown sugar added such a nice subtle sweetness to the flavor that coupled well with the coffee and dark beer (I used Guiness Extra Stout). While I think sometimes ingredients like coffee, beer, honey, etc. is more gimmick, I could really taste the influence of the dark coffee and beer here.

The wasabi didn't shine through at all, so this ingredient doesn't seem to make or break the recipe. If you don't have any on hand I wouldn't fret over it.

I'm looking forward to my leftovers and to making this recipe again!

I think this is a great recipe.  I did modify some of the cooking technique.  Rather than try to brown the meat with the onions and garlic; I first sweat the onions until translucent and added the garlic.  I removed that mixture and browned the chopped meat, removing it from the pan with a slotted spatula and reserved in a medium bowl, and repeated the process with the sausage meat.  I drained both bowls of any remaining fat in the bowls before returning to the  pot.  Prepared the recipe as written except I drained the liquid from the beans as I do not like too much liquid in my chili.  I also diced the Serrano pepper and omitted the Habanero pepper (by accident) but the chili still had a good mild heat to it.  If you can't find Serrano peppers, jalepeno is an acceptable substitute.  If you skip the habanero like I did, add an additional Serrano pepper. The anaheim chilis came 3 in the pack and used all 3.  If you cannot find Anaheim peppers, use Poblano Pepper.  Prepping this way will take a bit longer but there is no grease in the chili that others complained about.  I also did the two plus hours of simmering without a lid on the pot to reduce the liquid and concentrate the flavors.  Makes a lot but its so good it never lasts long.  Enjoy!

This is an awesome chili, it has won me many raves and a couple cook-offs.  I have probably made this 40-50 times.  The only thing I did slightly different was to Grill all of the peppers.  I used 1 each of Habinero, Serrano, Pablano, Jalapeno, and Anaheim Chile.  Grilled and diced before adding to the chili.  I also do not put beans in my chili, instead I added a pound of Chorizo.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

We have made this chili many times and get raves each and every time.  We won a chili cook off with this recipe, the fan favorite and judges' favorite.  We have never used the wasabi paste and add a few star anise which we pull out after the chili cools.  We always drain off any fat from the meat before adding it to the pot to keep it from being too greasy.   It is just fabulous.

I'm not even a big chili person and I love this chili.  I first tasted it when my brother made it, and I thought it was so tasty that I asked him for the recipe.  Since then I've made it three times myself.  Always delicious, every time!  :-)

love this recipe!  Just made it again this week. A few subtle changes were made.  I try and avoid adding sugar, so i used 1/2 a packet of splenda for sweetness.  Also, my family is not a huge fan of hot peppers so i used a mix of mild green pepper and a cuban pepper.  Just an awesome recipe.  I serve it with brown rice, and several toppings my family can choose from-green onions, shredded cheddar, sour cream, Franks Red hot sauce and fresh tomatoes.

I was a little worried to try this recipe as it called for coffee, I am 100% glad that I did! The flavors were so intense, with almost a sweet taste at first with one heck of a kick in the tail end! I followed the recipe with the exception of adding sirloin to the mix as one reviewer suggested. I too entered this recipe in a chili cook off today and took first place by a landslide! This is a must to add to your arsenal if you love chili!!

This is the best chili Ive ever had. I did add cubed tenderloin and added 4 chopped stalks of celery and 2 cans of diced tomato's. I used Sam Adams BL this time. The type of beer used really affects the over all flavor as the last time I made this, I used a local micro brew. So if you this this tastes off, you might consider a different kind of beer.

I love this chili... I really love spicy food, and this IS spicy... might recommend cutting down the peppers or using peppers a little more mild than a habanero if you can't handle it as spicy as it is. I used a full pound of ground sausage, and red stripe because that's the only beer I had available. I added a little bit more wasabi while cooking because as far as I can tell it doesn't add a whole bunch to the taste of it.

We LOVED this chili!!  I couldn't find wasabi paste so ommitted it.  Also used half the chili powder and cumin called for and doubled the tomatoes.  Great flavor!  This recipe is a keeper!

my wife has declared this the best chile I've ever made.  the sauce was a nice blend of hot and sweet.  I used about 5 smallish and very mature Serrano peppers, and since this is the only source of the heat along with wasabi powder, it was not overly spicy.  The sauce overall was very complex.  It will be making this again!

Excellent chili!  Upped the sausage to 1 lb, used a jalapeno because the store didn't have any habanero, and subbed out one can of kidney beans for a can of pinto.  When making again I would drain the liquid after cooking the meat per another review, since the chili was a bit oily.  Served with skillet cornbread and it was delicious!

This recipe makes some epic chili as is, but I do usualy substitute one bottle of Youngs Chocolate Stout for the beer and I don't bother with the coffee since the Youngs is coffee/chocolatey flavored.

I love this recipe.  2nd time I made it and I didn't use the oil as recommended.  I only used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil - 1 for the garlic onion and 1 for the peppers.  The meat throws plenty of grease.  I drained the garlic/onion/meat before continuing.  I just love the flavor of this dish.

By far best chili we have ever had. Everyone who tastes it when we make it-loves it and asks for recipe! Such a bold flavor with the coffee, beer, and wasabi! I love it!

absolutely the best flavored chilli, I have ever made and I do make a lot of chilli in particularly through the winter. If I have one complaint it might be to have it a little thicker, but it makes a great thick hearty soup too.

This chili is awesome. I've made it countless times and have come to customize it so my picky hubby can enjoy it. I leave the sugar out and use sweet red and green bell peppers. He likes the flavor just as long as I leave the hot peppers out. O well...Everything else stays the same.

Okay I have to say...awesome! BUT I exchanged the brown sugar with agave and drained the beans and use 1/4 expresso for the coffee! We like ours thicker. Also had the Tums handy but it was worth it!

Devilishy hot and spicy! I have made this a few times and the second time I did not slice up the habernero pepper; I threw it in whole and it still added plenty of heat. I do not remember the exact brand of beer I've used but I recommend something strong and malty. The sweetness of the malts compliment the heat of the dish.

I rarely give 5 stars but this recipe was just that good.  I changed the quantity of some of the ingredients based on my family's taste and I didn't have wasabi paste but I don't think it mattered.  I think this recipe could be made exactly as described or changed a little and it will still be fantastic.  Thanks for the great chili recipe.  I think this one will replace my old reliable chili recipe.

this is a phenomenal recipe- i cut the beer and coffee in half because my son tastes EVERY ingredient and pick those two out, but even with both at full portions, it's fantastic. i add a few more seasonings because I LOVE spice, but this is as close to a perfect recipe as I've ever found!

This is my favorite chili recipe I have ever had. Whenever I make it for friends or family, they say the same!! I am not a huge fan of spicy, so I usually put in about 1/2 the amount of each kind of pepper, and I also omit the Wasabi. Lame, right? :P But I'm a plain kinda gal - and I LOVE this chili!! It is a must try. Tweak to your palette and enjoy!!!

Great chili! The type of beer you use will really change the flavor of the chili so I definitely want to experiment with other beers. I only added on Anaheim pepper (not a spicy pepper) and left out the others. It was plenty spicy, but not too much that our toddler wouldn't eat it. Excellent flavor!!!!

This was my first chili-making experience. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I substituted the habanero pepper with scotch bonnet, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and used one can of black beans; two cans of kidney. I also used an entire pound of Italian sausage. This chili is goooooddd!  Following the order of recipe exactly was a bit of a pain (four tablespoons of oil divided and such). Also, next time I think I'll just put the chilies in directly. I thought cooking them separately was kind of pointless (and generated extra dirty dishes). The chili wasn't as hot as I expected, but that's probably because I wussed out and took most of the seeds out of the peppers.

I followed the recipe except the habinaro pepper and I used a slow cooker. I thought it was good and would have rated it 4+ stars, especially since I was able to try it reheated from being in the fridge, however I got the lowest score in our chili cook-off!  Kind of a downer after putting over 1 hour of prep. time into it.  In my opinion, it was better after being reheated.  Hope your luck is better than mine, which it should be by looking at the other reviews.  Maybe I should blame my judges ;)  The consolation prize was a bottle of Tums (which I didn't need)!

This chili rocks!!  I did tone down the pepper situation cause i gotta toddler.  I used chipolte pepper instead of cayenne because chipolte adds a smokey flavor.  Also, I used ground deer instead of ground beef.  This recipe is now my offical chili recipe!!!

This chili had a very interesting and distinct flavor. It was very yummy. I left out the coffee (because I didn't have any) and I used ground turkey. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

All I can say is, WOW- this is the best chili I have ever made! I did leave out the habenero as I couldn't find any in the store, but added 2 extra serrano peppers and 3 jalepeno's. It was also the hottest chili I have ever made, but it was very tasty- the heat was not overpowering like it can be sometimes. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Well worth the effort- as long as you like HOT chili!

Wonderful. The only thing I did differently was that I doubled the hamburger (no sausage in the freezer) and left out the spicy peppers (I can't do real spicy) and added a sweet pepper. My husband and I ate it all week and enjoyed it very much. My husband loves spicy and I thought maybe he'd add to it, but said it was wonderful as is.

Best chili recipe I've ever had! Made 12 servings for a chili cook-off, and it was a hit. Chili seems to be one of those things with a flexible recipe so we rounded up for most of the ingredients. This recipe is already pretty spicy, so it doesn't need more than 4 peppers(Anaheim, Serrano, habanero) for 8 servings - more over powers the other great flavours. Otherwise, fantastic. Would definitely make it again.

I never made chili before and I needed to make chili for a cook off at Edwards AFB.  I made this recipe and won first place.  The only change I made was adding Elk with the burger and sausage.

I went ahead and added double the meat because it really was too soupy as others have said.  I thought the chili tasted fine the first day, but did not like it's taste or smell a few days later.  I'm not a beer or coffee drinker, so it might have been that.  I probably won't make this one again.

Holy Cow!  My entire family loved this.  Yummy on noodles with some cheese or with tortilla chips.  The ingredient list would never clue you in on how good this really is.  I didn't change a thing, and my family it was absolutely wonderful.

Cooked it New Year's Eve for a Chili Cook-Off.  It did not win the contest (a wimpy bland Chili won - go figure!) But if you like spicy and Great Chili this one is one of best I have ever had or made!

Loved this chili recipe! Fantastic flavors!  I used 2 serrano, because the store was out of habinaros - glad I did because it was just hot enough, think the habinaro would have made it too hot for our family.

Really yummy!  Used groud sirloin instead of the ground beef.  Browned the meat, onion and garlic in a skillet and let cook overnight on low in a slowcooker.

I love this recipe.  I won a camping chili cook-off where there were 11 entries.  The only thing I changed was cutting the brown sugar in half.  I used Harp for the beer.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The flavors really do blend together and mellow out. I had reduced the chilis in fear of it being hot, but should have left them in. I used 2 cans pintos as well.

This recipe is so tasty!  I picked this one because I had spicy turkey sausage that needed used up...but I didn't have wasabi or habenero (the 2 main ingred) I had everything else so I went for it, and it's fantastic!  Chili is usually the one dish I make from the "packets"...(I thought it was faster and easier) but this was pretty easy to make.  Tim helps with the chopping of the veggies...he loves garlic, so we used a head of garlic.  Can't wait to make this again, WITH the wasabi.  Yummmmmmmmmmm

This chili is amazing!  We loved the wasabi-beer flavor.  I was wondering what type of beer people liked in the chili.  Guiness is what we used.  I am a wuss and can't handle the heat of the chilis.  So, we used anaheim and poblano chilis rather than serrano and habanero.  I also used diced New York Strip instead of the ground beef (it was on sale).   Really fantastic.  Thank you!

Great Chili Recipe.  I substituted ground beef with sirloin and used two can of black beans and one can of kidney.  I also used a porter for the beer.  Really spicy but flavorful.

We made this over Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It is a different kind of chili but very good and pretty spicy.

Absolutely the BEST! I used extra beef broth in place of the beer and it turned out wonderful! This is the only chili recipe I will be making from now on!

By far the best chili I've ever made. My husband ate it for three days straight! The only change I made was using fresh ground bison meat instead of beef. Fantastic!

Good.  But my husband and I agree that I have made better.  I used steak instead of hamburger.  That was the only change.

Loved it!  I wanted to try this recipe for all the different ingredients in it, and it was wonderful!  Very thick and flavorful.  I did use regular sausage instead of Italian and regular beer instead of dark (since I had those on hand).  My HTB even said it was better than his chili!  Thanks for the great recipe!

AWESOME Chili!  Bold Spices, yet not overpowering.  Will certainly make this one again.
