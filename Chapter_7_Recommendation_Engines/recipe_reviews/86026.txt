this was sooooo good! it took around 20-25 min to get completely cooked but i just waited for the meringue to get a nice tan on it and took it out. the edges were beginning to crack a bit and it was puffed up in the middle. it was perfect. yes the meringue cracked when it was cut into squares but no one cared! this was fabulous!!! a new favourite.

This recipe has great potential but I had a couple of problems with it. First of all these bars had a very nice flavor but needed a little salt! I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for 1/4 cup of shortening but had problems with the bottom of the dessert being underbaked. It needed to be baked at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Also the meringue looked beautiful and puffy as it baked but when I took them out it shrunk down and pulled away from the side creating a rather ugly appearance. The one redeeming thing about this recipe is that it is tasty; like a giant chocolate chip cookie topped with meringue. With a few alterations this could be outstanding!

This recipe is ridiculously good. I bring in items to work probably 2-3 times a week and this has been praised as one of the best. A couple of tips: instead of stirring in the chocolate chips press them into the cookie dough before spreading on the meringue. After spreading on the meringue press parchment paper lightly onto the fluff so that it doesn't brown too quickly. Carefully peel it off 2/3 of the way through baking and continue baking to allow the meringue to crisp and brown. Allow to set overnight so that the meringue softens slightly and becomes chewy and splendid. YUMMMMM
