This was a very flavorful soup. Great for a cold day. Our daughter is dairy free so it was a nice new meal option for us.

I've made this recipe 3 times already and everyone who tasted it loves it!  I decided to make it with white sweet corn and diced a poblano pepper and onions which really made it spicy and delicious.  Such a great combination of flavors.....
Thank you!

Needs no salt/pepper at the end. Great spicy meal. I made without corn relish, but I did add 1/4 cup green bell peppers to balance spiciness. Coconut milk also balances the spices out. Thanks for sharing.
