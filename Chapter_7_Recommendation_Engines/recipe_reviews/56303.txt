Creamy, fudgey, rich and sinfully good. Be forewarned, you'll think you're skimping when you cut these into itty bitty bars, but a little of this goes a long way! I made these just as the recipe directed, but found I only needed 2-1/2 T. of the cherry juice in the frosting to get the consistency I wanted. I chilled the baked bars briefly before cutting them, just long enough for them to set and be somewhat firm. So, so pretty, and perfect for Valentine's Day! Too few cooks have made these--I hope you'll give these a try!

naples34102, you have - once again - steered me in the right direction. Holy Hannah, these are incredible!  Followed exactly, except dropped about 2 tsp cherry juice into the filling.

These fudgy bites will definitely satisfy a sweet tooth. And they are so pretty! Be sure to cut them in small squares  because they are beyond rich. I especially like the cherry icing. Make sure the pan of bars is totally cool before you spread the icing or you'll melt it. I think these taste best when stored in the refrigerator and served chilled. They are also much easier to cut when cold.

Made these as per the recipe and they were great. Did cut back a tiny bit on the cherry juice and placed a half a pitted FRESH cherry on top of each square. If I had a nice pitter, I would use the whole cherry with stem for presentation.  ALSO made the same recipe using the grated rind of one fresh orange in the "crust" Omitted the cherry juice and frosted with orange buttercream frosting and a dusting or cocoa powder insead of chocolate drizzle--this cut the overwhelming sweetness and got raves too.

I served these at a bridal shower where everything was pink.  They were a huge hit with over 30 guests!Everyone thought it was such a unique recipe and reminded them of chocolate covered cherries. 
I cut them in to little tiny (like petite fours) squares because they are so rich.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and put them in the fridge before cutting and unfortunately, this made them hard as a rock and really hard to cut.  If you choose to do this, make sure you let the pan sit out for a little bit so they are easier to cut!

I'm rating 4/5 b/c I didn't actually eat them, I'm fasting for Lent (no meat/dairy) but I made them for an office potluck and EVERYONE LOVES THEM! When I was making them I had to re read the instructions several times b/c I wasn't sure if I was doing it right...but they d/n take long at all & everyone loves 'em! Thanks for sharing!

I chose this recipe because I loved the colours and thought it would be a perfect way to use up my maraschino cherry juice.  I did follow the recipe exactly, I chilled for about 60 minutes before cutting.  I did find the cutting quite difficult, they just kept oozing at the side, and the chocolate constantly cracked.  Personally I think it would be better to cut before drizzling with the chocolate, sure it would give a more professional finish.  These are extremely sweet, you really do only need the smallest portion.

These came out better than I expected - rich, but not too sweet. I doubled the recipe and cooked them in a 9"x13" Pyrex. I cut them into 1" squares and it was just enough without being overwhelming. The chocoholics just went back for seconds! Definitely refrigerate before cutting, but not too long or it will be impossible to get the knife through the fudge. I also cut back on the cherry juice or the icing would have been too soft. Very indiscernible cherry flavor, so if you're looking for more, you may need to add something to boost it. Will definitely be making these for the holidays!

These sounded so interesting to me...and I wasn't dissapointed.  Easy to prepare, look pretty and sinfully sweet.  I agree with other reviewers that said a small piece goes a long way...very rich, but good.  Only changes I made was to "wing it" making the frosting.  I added the juice, but also finely chopped some cherries to kick up the cherry flavour.  Also added a tiny bit of almond extract.  Excellent recipe...Thanks!

I should have used my good judgment and not put the full amount of cherry juice in the icing because it made it too soft.  This made them hard to cut nicely, and would make transport difficult if you're planning to take them somewhere, as I was.  I thought the cherry flavor was too weak, and perhaps putting some chopped cherries in the icing would make them better.  But they're still pretty good and I ate way too many!

Pink Ladies are easy to make. They are sweet even for me and I am a big sweet eater. These sure are pretty. For me, I prefer a brownie with chocolate frosting but these are good. Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth.

These are different from the normal desserts, but super rich and I personally don't think the flavors blend that well together - specifically the crust. If I made these again, I would add a tbs of brown sugar into the crust and also put in a slightly bigger pan. The middle layer is too thick!

This dessert turned out very pretty. The icing wasn't the right consistency. I made it a lot thicker then what the recipe called for by adding additional powdered sugar. Very rich...

This was a fun, different recipe.  I made it for my husband to bring to work on halloween when he dressed up as a Grease "Pink Lady."  I only put the 2 Tablespoons of cherry juice in the frosting.  Interestingly  kids said it was very cherry-y, but most adults just got a hint of cherry.  They were very pretty and not hard to make.  A little goes a long way.

This is a very pretty dessert bar. I followed directions & it turned out beautiful. I didn't add the chocolate icing though. These are very very sweet, so cut the bars tiny!

VERY rich, but delicious. The middle layer is basically fudge. I thought the bottom layer was a little thick, hard, and dry but, other than that, it came out very good. I drizzled chocolate glaze on top rather than melted chocolate and ran a butter knife through to make a design. It was difficult to cut at first, but after I cut a few squares, the whole thing popped right out of the pan, so I placed it on a cutting board, which made it much easier to cut. I cut very small squares, because it's so rich.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I made them for bridal showers and other get togethers. I even made them for a boy baby shower and dyed the icing blue and called them "blue babies"

Oh man do you need a sweet tooth for these!  They are SO SWEET, yet SO GOOD!  One's enough, (which is a good thing) at a time.  After reading reviews I only used about 2 Tbs. of cherry juice and it made the icing perfect consistency.  Yummy!

Made this for Breast Cancer Awareness day at work and they were gone before Noon!    This felt a little out of my league at first but after finishing the recipe I am ready for more.  Great for people wanting to try something new and great for beginners wanting to take the next step in baking (like myself)!  Looking forward to making it again to show off for a different group.

Wow...  rich, fudge, cherry goodness.  Don't let the pictures deceive you, the little bite size squares are MORE THAN ENOUGH to satisfy a sweet tooth!  I was dumb and made a double batch in a 9X13 in pan...  it made waaaay too many.  And they're so rich they're hard to get rid of!  I had to use 2.5 TBSP of cherry juice.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  Very good!  Will make again!

These were great! I didnt have an 8x8 pan and so I used an 11x7 pan as all recipes suggests in their pan conversion article. The crust and fudge layer was perfect for this but I found with substituting the pan size I needed to double the icing. It worked out well with getting to use the first batch as a crumb coating anyway. The office and family loved it!

Waaaay too sweet for me.... I couldn't have more than one bite. Also the crust didn't really form properly, it was pretty crumbly making them hard to cut.

Awesome.  I normally don't care for icing, but the taste of the cherry juice blended so well with the rest of the square.  I had no problems using 3 tbsp. of cherry juice like some others stated - consistency was perfect.  The kids LOVED it.

I made these the way the recipe directed.  They were extremely sweet.  I love sweets normally, but these were almost too much for me, even after cutting them into tiny squares.  The chocolate layer is very rich, but the icing makes them overwhelming.

These are like every girl's dream! For the icing, I added a little extra powdered sugar and skipped the butter- These are rich enough already

I made 3 different cookies for Valentine's day trays and this by far was the most liked, many people asked for the recipe.  I used the 8x8 but I lined it with parchment paper and it worked perfectly.  I followed all of the other directions with two excpetions, the first I used about 1/3 cup of white choc chips in place of all choc. and lastly I added about 1/3 of a cup of chopped candied cherries to the frosting.  Quick, easy and delicious!

I made these for a Breast Cancer Awareness Bake-Off at my boyfriend's office.  (Everything donated had to be pink).  These were pretty tasty.  Very sugary.  Sold all but a few.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my guys really liked them. They are basically a chocolate crust with a solid 'hot fudge' layer and a cherry icing. Just a bit much for me and I have a terrible sweet tooth. I think if I made them again, I would double the crust or halve the fudge and the icing. I was trying to figure out how I could increase the cherry flavor....I thought about putting a cherry half on each piece, but they are so rich you have to cut them too small for that. If I made these again, I would use them on a cookie tray and not by themselves.
