If I could give this 3 1/2 stars I would.  It comes close to the Mexican chili sauce -  I know and love.  If you can get it use New Mexico or California Chili powder - CA chili is milder than New Mexico Chili powder (both are sold in small cello bags in the Mexican section of the market for less than a $1.00)  Also, I would suggest using chicken broth instead of water.  I made this as a directed using CA chili powder & water - the taste was lacking so I added a cube of chicken bouillon - that really bumped up the flavor.   This sauce makes a  great wet burrito or for a sauce for Chili Rellenos.

Totally like MV gravy!  And for those of you knocking it, come to North Dakota, this is the closest thing we get to good Mexican! I have found if you use a can of Flavorite Enchilada sauce and another can of chicken stock it makes up for the flavor, but this recipe tastes just like Mexican Village gravy.  So when you have a hankering for some homeschool taste of home, this is it!

It's a good recipe,  but lacks flavor in my opinion...  I added garlic powder, more salt and tomato sauce...  It was on point after that!  My husband begs me to make enchiladas now!

I made this as shown in the recipe and found it was very bland. I kicked up the salt and added some granulated garlic and beef bullion and it still needed something. So I added about two tablespoons of tomato paste. The tomato paste added that richness I was looking for. We used it on top of burritos before baking in the oven and it was quite tasty. I think it would make a good enchilada sauce as well.
