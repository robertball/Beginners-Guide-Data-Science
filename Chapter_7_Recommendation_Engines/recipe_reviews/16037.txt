I made this in a bundt pan and topped the slices with whipped cream. The cake was very moist. Be sure to really chop the cherries up very finely and mix them well throughout the batter, otherwise you'll have trouble getting the cake out of the pan.

This tasted much better than I was expecting! I had to use Funfetti cake mix, as my dinky grocery store was sold out of plain white mix. It was a little funky looking inside, but it sure tasted good. Thanks :)

This cake is so very good!  I used the whole 8 ounce bottle of cherries and put in the food processor and it worked great!  I didnt have cool whip like I thought so i poured sweetend condensed milk(dulce de leche) over the top.  It was decadent.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it using a moist white cake mix. I added 8oz of maraschino cherries and could have used more. I used pecans as well. The cherries and pecans were chopped in a food processor before I put each into the cake mix. I used a bundt cake pan. Excellent! I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious! I omitted the pecans  for the sake of the kids and added some almond extract to the batter. I also used a whole 8 oz. jar of cherries (I've never seen a 4 oz. jar). I made 2 single layer heart cakes ans frosted them with 'Grocery Store Frosting', also from this site. Everyone really loves the flavor of this cake...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I found I  only needed an 8 oz container of whipped topping....I think 16 oz would be too much.  I really like the recipe.

I made this for Valentine's Day, of course, and it turned out wonderful.   I used a bundt cake pan and instead of frosting I sprinkled powered sugar over the cake.  It turned out beautiful and delicious!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!! :)

Made this cake for Valentine's day and it was enjoyed by all.  I poured half a pan with nuts and the other half without.  I had problems with the cherries sinking to the bottom.  It didn't affect the taste, just made the sliced appearances a little off.  I frosted this with 'Grocery Store Frosting' from this site and that added a wonderful richness to the cake.
