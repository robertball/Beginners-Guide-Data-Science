I read some of the other reviews about it turning out soggy, so I made some adjustments. Instead of using sliced bread, I used a baggette that I had. I also used six eggs and a little less milk.  It was soooo yummy, and not soggy at all!

This was fantastic.  I made it the night before Mother's Day so I wouldn't have to make breakfast, and it was amazing.  Combined the ingredients the night before and baked it in the morning.  I used a french baguette sliced and chunks of cream cheese and raspberries instead of the banana.  Will be making this again soon.

Used 6 eggs instead of 8 because I also used 3 ripe mashed bananas.  Used diced challah bread.  Followed the rest of the recipe & it came out well.

Was hunting for a baked banana french toast recipe that did NOT require overnight refrigeration, since I had ripe bananas and whole-grain French bread crying out to be used and needed something TODAY.  This was perfect!  I made a few changes, but nothing major.  Added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, used 7 eggs and about 2 cups milk, used somewhat more than 1/3 cup dark brown sugar.  Added about 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring, added a couple of pinches of salt, and used 4 sliced, very-ripe bananas.  Also did not melt butter; simply cubed it and scattered the cubes.  I layered half the bread, bananas,  nuts & butter in pan, then repeated layers.  Whisked together eggs, milk, vanilla, rum flavoring, brown sugar & spices, and poured evenly over bread layers.  Waited about 15 minutes, then baked at 350 degrees for an hour.  Served with syrup--to RAVE reviews from hubby and visiting adult stepdaughter.  :-)  Definitely will be making again!  Yum... excellent!

So, I had too many bananas. I used 4 defrosted overripe bananas. Because of that, I only used 5 eggs. I used cinnamon raisin toast as the bread. I added clove too and only used 1/4 cup sugar. I think this recipe would have benefitted from pretoasting of the bread. The whole thing was tasty, but soggy.

I made it but used wheat bread and added walnut. I enjoyed it. Hopefully will be a hit for my kids in the morning!

This is a great recipe!  Loved it!  I highly suggest using crusty bread such as a baguette that is a couple days old and hard.  This will prevent the sogginess others have complained about.  The liquid needs something to absorb into, which is harder with fresh sandwich bread.  Next - I mashed the bananas into the egg mixture - there were still bits of banana but not big chucks. My kids preferred this.  I will definitely make this again and highly recommend to others.  Cheers!

I use 4 bananas and 10 pieces of whole wheat bread. Easy to make, tasted good. It would be incredible with some syrup!

This was fabulous for a special "breakfast for dinner" night! I used Kings Hawaiian dinner rolls and diced pecans. Almost two full packages made a nice texture!

The first time I made this, I thought it was good, but a little bland. The second time I used Southern Comfort Vanilla Spice Egg Nog in place of the milk,  vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. So delicious!

Great as a "make-ahead" for a brunch.  I added some pecans and loved the flavor and crunch.  Easy and quick to put together.

It came out perfect. Easy recipe to follow. I did 6 eggs instead and used a baguette for the bread. I also made a caramel sauce to drizzle on top. Big hit with the kids.

I made this for a church breakfast. I used only 6 eggs due to soggy reviews and reduced milk a little. I used blueberries instead of bananas. It was a hit!

Easy but a bit bland. Next time I would put in less eggs (6) and also sprinkle more cinnamon and sugar on top.

I realized after I made it that I forgot to add the brown sugar...but we never even missed it! Crew of 6 boys loved this! Served with berries and syrup. Requested for next weekend already!

I used regular bread also, and also got soggy results. Next time will try adjusting the custard (eggs to liquid ratio).  Will also try a shallower baking dish. Otherwise recipe is good enough to develope further. Al Cush, will also try the walnuts !

I used leftover hamburger buns and regular load bread. I also added pecans and walnuts. This is delicious. My only question is; is it supposed to be a lil soggy? I cooked it on 350 for 35 mins but added an additional 7 minutes.
