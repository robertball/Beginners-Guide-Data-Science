I loved these & so did my husband. I didn't change a thing except to add a couple more sprinkles of sesame oil because the shallots & garlic looked like they were cooking dry. Will have again & again. Served them w/ Sirloin Steaks & Garlic Butter (from this site) & fresh sliced pears. (I like to serve sliced pears or apples w/ garlicky foods because they act as a palate cleanser.)

What I liked most about this is the cooking method! Blanching the green beans before finishing them off in the skillet served to preserve their vibrant green color, and made them perfectly crisp-tender. I finished cooking the beans in the skillet together with the shallots and garlic as I didn't want to take a chance of overcooking them. I added some chopped red pepper for color and eye appeal, and finished them with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil.  I forgot the sesame seeds, darn it, but these were so good we didn't even miss them. These weren't "spicy," as indicated in the title, but they sure were good, and  truly stood apart from your everyday green beans!

This has been my favorite Asian-style green beans yet. I've tried some higher-rated ones and wasn't impressed. This will be my new method, with the addition of Sriracha. For the record, I subbed (liberally) soy sauce for the salt in this recipe, and that probably made a big difference. Be sure to take a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to your freshly-drained green beans BEFORE adding them to your hot oil, or you'll throw grease splash-back onto yourself. Drying them also helps them to blister and brown like they're supposed to (instead of steam and mush, like they are not supposed to). I wish the instructions included that step, because it's a standard cautionary procedure (never add water to hot oil, etc.) but I don't fault the recipe for that. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Way too many sesame seeds, definitely not spicy, couldn't even taste any garlic, and I just wasn't impressed. I followed the recipe as directed. Other recipes found here for the same type dish are far better. They weren't bad, but the name implies a flavor that just wasn't there. Now call them sesame green beans, make some small adjustments and I give this a 4. Sorry :(

This was a great tasty way of making green beans!  When we made it, however, we added red and yellow peppers to add some color and flavor and it was GREAT!  Thanks!

there are definitely extra sesame seeds that end up staying the in pan... but I like sesame so its ok. It's definitely not spicy like the name says. I added oyster sauce for some more flavour and because I really like it. Good though!

Really quick and easy side dish! I would add some red peper flakes to this for an added kick. I can't really have sesame seeds but the sesame oil added the flavor so it was all good.

These are really good. I wouldn't call them spicy though. My family loved them and it was a nice change from the normal green beans. I did steam my green beans instead of blanching them. I didn't have any ice. I will make these again. Thanks!

I cut the sesame seeds back by half and added a sprinkling of red pepper flake, other than that I made no changes. Very good. No leftovers. I served this with brown rice and Budget Bytes Honey Sriracha Chicken.

I like the method, but there wasn't enough flavor for me. It's missing something, despite all those sesame seeds (which I found to be too much). I will add teriyaki sauce or honey or something in the future. Thanks for the base recipe!

This was great except why would anyone boil their vegetables? Why not just steam them? It takes just as long if not shorter to do that and the vegetables keep their value. This paired exceptionally well with the rosemary ranch chicken kabobs.

Not spicy, not garlicky. A little bland.  The cooking method was great, blanching and adding to skillet. Beens were green, and perfectly cooked.  Needed something more.

Family liked this for a change of taste. I used about 1/4 of the amount of sesame seeds in the recipe; don't dump them in all at once, sprinkle until you have what you want. I didn't have regular sesame oil, mine was chili sesame oil, so there was a little heat to them, but not too much. Seems a little work intensive first time you make it, but really is a pretty simple dish. I gave 4 stars partly because of the huge amount of sesame seeds just didn't seem right.

Easy and a great base! I don't keep sesame seeds at my house so that was the only one left out, otherwise, followed the rest.  The title says spicy but where is the spicy ingredient? Will be using chili oil for the next round.

I tried this with spinach and bell pepper instead of green beans, because that's what i had on hand.  Tasty stuff!  Good with the sesame seeds, but it's not a deal breaker.  Added a splash of chardonnay while things were sauteeing. :)

I thought this was just so-so. A little too heavy on the seasame seeds and not too spicy either. Seemed like it was missing just a little something, not sure what. I liked it all right, but I probably could have thrown together something better.

While these were cooked perfectly they lacked flavor. I'll add some low sodium soy sauce next go round and much less sesame seeds too... 1/4 cup is way too much!

This recipe was okay. It definitely was not spicy. However, to make this dish spicy and more flavorful I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce. My husband and I ate this dish; but I will probably not make this again.

I really enjoyed this, did two versions and followed recipe for one exactly. Seperate frying pan added oyster sauce to the second and a little siracha.  Really enjoyed how the ice bath kept them perfect.  The oyster sauce is what really worked for us.  I felt the need to follow the recipe directly to try them, but glad I added a little extra.

Easy to make and just delicious. Loved the sesame twist. Just a great dish, My husband even enjoyed it so that's a big plus for vegetables

Simple and truly amazing...I did not change a thing.  I LOVE sesame oil, you just have to watch cause it can over power if you use too much!

Nothing special.  I also didn't like the texture of the sesame seed.

2 minutes was not long enough to cook whole green beans and the recipe was a bit bland.

What a treat! Garlic, garlic, garlic! I of course added more garlic. I didn't have sesame seeds so, I used sunflower seeds. Every one enjoyed it. This is a keeper!
