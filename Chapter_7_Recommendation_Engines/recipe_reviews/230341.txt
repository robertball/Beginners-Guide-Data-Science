I liked the flavor but not the texture, but that's easy enough to fix (it was too thick, almost like pudding). My husband wasn't crazy about the flavor; he thought the arugula was too strong. But my one-year-old liked it!

A light, refreshing soup.  Added a good amt of salt/pepper and cayenne pepper for flavor.  The texture is what it is... you will either love it or hate it.  But super healthy and packed full of protein!

So bad. Bland and the consistency was horrible.
