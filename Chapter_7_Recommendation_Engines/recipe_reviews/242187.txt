I really enjoyed this! It was a lot of work, though. I used a springform pan, so I cut the amounts slightly. I ground pretzels in the food processor (about 1 3/4 c. total). I used 2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp brown sugar, and only 6 Tbsp butter (but probably could've used a full half cup). While the crust baked, I rinsed out the food processor and used it to blend the cream cheese and sugar, then lemon juice and vanilla. Transferred to a bowl and stirred in the lemon zest. I'm not a fan of Cool-Whip, so I whipped 6 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the cream cheese. Delicious! It was just the right sweetness (even with unsweetened whipped cream), with a great lemon flavor. [I only used 3/4 c cream because I wanted to be sure the filling was firm enough to slice.] While the filling chilled, I BLANCHED THE KIWI. The gelatin won't set otherwise. I peeled and sliced the kiwi, placed slices in a strainer, and lowered it into boiling water. Blanched it for about 45 seconds, transferred the strainer to an ice water bath, and then set kiwi slices aside with the mango. For the gelatin, I used the ice water bath from blanching the kiwi to chill the gelatin mixture until it was ready to pour on the fruit. My verdict? I thought the lemon Jell-O detracted from the rest of the dessert. Next time, I'd play with using fruit juice (mango, or passionfruit) and use 1 pack unsweetened gelatin. Just enough to make a shiny, fruity glaze—not so much for a floating gelatin layer. But I will try this again!

Really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I would make a few adjustments.  First of all, 3/4 cup butter is waaaay too much!  I would cut down to about 1/4 cup; do 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon juice in the Jell-o; omit kiwi and add more mango (Kiwi reacts funny in Jell-o and it was a little runny); and I think it would be good even with a pineapple Jell-o and maybe some coconut in the crust even!

Weirdly good.  It was a lot of work for a novelty salad, but everyone enjoyed it, I had no leftovers, and several folks asked for the recipe.  Maybe it just seemed like a lot of work, after all.  The flavors were nice and balanced; I'll make this one again.  Thank you for submitting the recipe.

Still one of my favorite recipes to make.  In high demand in my household, regardless of the season. I still can’t get the kiwi right, but that’s me, not the recipe
