I made this recipe last night.  Some of the reviews mentioned how the popcorn stuck to the paper bag.  I solved that problem by lightly spraying the inside of the bag with Pam.  It worked like a dream.  I baked it at 250 degrees for 1 hour stirring every 15 minutes.  I thought it was still going to be kind of mushy, but today it's nice a crisp.  Very good flavor.  I will make it again.

I made this recipe for a holiday party and gave the leftovers to the host.  Another person in their family is anti-sweets and gave the leftovers back to us.  The host actually called and asked us to return the leftovers because it was the best he's ever tasted!  You know a recipe is good when someone is willing to humiliate themselves to get more!  Also, I drizzled melted chocolate into the mix.  Great recipe.

YUM!  I modified it because I'm lazy like that.  2 bags of microwave popcorn, crushed up pretzels and chopped up pecans with the brown sugar base.  10 extra minutes in the oven definitely did the trick.  Thank you!

What a yummy treat...Even better then crunch and munch and cracker jacks.
I only had 2 cups peanuts so I threw in 2 cups almonds.  Next time I'll try cashews. Soo good. I did skip the paperbag method and just mixed in a large stock pot and put into two aluminum lasagna pans and baked for the 10 minutes.  Absolutely delicious.  Soak your dishes in warm soapy water for 15 min for easy clean-up.  This recipe makes a ton so you might want to half it.   Once you start eating-you wont stop.  The salty pretzel adds such a nice twist to this caramel popcorn treat.

This recipe is great except it doesn't mention what turns out to be the most important part of making caramel corn. After making a first batch with clumps of caramel mixed in with plain parts with no caramel, a woman at work clued me it to the critical missing step! Once you have mixed the caramel in with the popcorn, pretzels, and nuts, put small batches in a PAM-sprayed microwave-safe bowl and put in the microwave on high for two to three minutes total, stopping after each minute to stir the mixture. The caramel will completely coat the popcorn and stuff, yielding that great texture similar to cracker jacks. Other than that missing tip (which I can't believe wasn't in any reviews that I saw), this recipe works great! The paper bag idea is definitely a keeper!

I made this today for Christmas gift baskets. It made a lot of treats and turned out great. I did bake it on parchment lined cookie sheets for a few minutes after pouring on the carmel. I will make it again, but next time I think I will put 1/2 of the popcorn mixture on the bottom of the bag, then half of the carmel, half popcorn, half carmel. I think it will probably mix easier that way. I will also use the suggestion of spraying the bag with pam to avoid too much stickage. No loss - I just ate the stuck stuff while backing the rest of the batch... Great Recipe!

GREAT..but a couple changes make it AMAZING... used 2 bags of (lowfat-ha ha) kettle corn.  made exactly to directions using pretzels and cashews.  Put in large stainless bowl sprayed w/cook spray. (you could also spray inside of paper bag to prevent sticking) Mixed well.  Put 2/3 of it in a foil (for easy clean up) roasting pan in oven for only about 5 minutes and then I melted about 8 Dove dark chocolate candies in microwave, tossed chocolate in remaining 1/3 caramel corn and put in fridge to cool.  Took about 15 min.  Broke up large pieces and added it to remaining cool caramel corn.  This is a real treat.  Trust me, try it!!!

This caramel is perfect! I did a half batch, using one bag of low-fat butter-flavored microwave popcorn. I broke the pretzels by hand, which was time-consuming (next time, I'll stick the pretzel sticks in a baggie and beat them with something :), and I used regular salted peanuts. I also used salted butter (next time, I'll use 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine to see how it works!). The caramel mixture foamed up after I added the vanilla, not the baking soda. I think it was the alcohol in my fake vanilla flavoring. :) I put it all in a huge brown bag and had the same problem other reviewers had: the caramel pools on the bottom. So I madly stirred it and dumped it out on two baking sheets to cool. Peeling the caramel-covered peanuts (the nuts sunk to the bottom) out of the bag was a hassle, but yummy! I did not need to put it in the oven, letting it cool on the cookie sheets was perfect for us. My three-year old loves it. Thanks, Rookieswife. :) You rock.

WOW  really good!!  I didn't have a paper bag so I mixed it in a large stock pot.  This is the second time I've made this...the first batch went really fast.  I doubled the recipe this time, but I don't recomend it...too much to mix at one time.

Very good.  I made this with my children to take to neighbors as a holiday goody.  I'll have to make another batch as my kids can't keep their hands out of it!  I didn't pop quite enough popcorn or have quite enough pretzels so I made up the difference by adding coarsely chopped pecans.  It convinced me that this is a perfect recipe for experimenting.  I can't think of many add ins that wouldn't be delicious.

This was sooo good.  I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings and it still made a ton!  I boiled the sugar mixture for 8 minutes to make sure the candy hardened really well.  It turned out great.  The only thing I will do differently next time is stir the mixture with a wooden spoon because my plastic spoon melted right into the mixture and I had to start over.

Yummy taste!  Had a hard time coating the peanuts/almonds?  Used a paper bag sprayed with cooking spray & it worked great...no sticking.  Family loved it!

While this was tasty, I thought there wasn't quite enough sauce. Spraying the bag is a must and thank the reviewer for that. Shaking the bag didn't quite get it done, so I stirred the contents of the bag with a long wooden spoon. I, personally would have liked it a little more chewy and not crisp so next time I will cook the caramel a little less. But is is tasty and I will make it again.

I feel like giving this recipe 41/2 stars. My husband didn't care for it much, I loved it. Made only 1/4th of the recipe to see how it turns out. The caramel ended up being more than mixture. Baked it in the oven for 12 mins. One needs to be patient, I kept tasting it when it didn't even get crisp. I liked it, thanks.

This is dangerously good! I did bake mine to get it more crispy. I only halved this recipe but not the caramel sauce. Suggestions; you'll need to double caramel sauce if doing 8 cups of popcorn plus the cups of nuts and pretzels

I have been making this recipe for Christmas for the past 4 years, and it is a BIG hit. Because it is so popular I make 3 times the recipe. My trick is to use a large aluminum roasting pan lined with wax paper, fill 3/4 with the popcorn, peanuts and pretzels, then pour the caramel mixture over, using 2 spatulas (sprayed with Pam) scooped down and flip the mixture. After I make all the bathes and they cooled, I combine them into large garbage bags to fully mix. Also if the caramel is too sticky, place the mixture outside and it cools hard.

This is seriously addictive stuff...i heeded other reviewers and sprayed a large paper grocery bag with Pam quite generously.  I also mixed the popcorn, pretzels and nuts (i used almonds) before I added the caramel IN STAGES, NOT ALL AT ONCE and VOILA..no stickage of caramel.  I added the caramel in 4 divided doses tossing the mix in between. I also baked it for 10 minutes in 2 pans as suggested.  ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. I did a test batch with drizzled milk chocolate but it was too sweet...it's perfect the way it is...

YUMMMMY!! made this for a baseball/tailgate outing, this turned out great.  I did boil the mixture longer as I like a little bit of a crispy carmel popcorn.  Recipe makes a ton, I didnt change a thing.  Nect time I may try to drizzle some melted chocolate over!  This one is  a keeper

Amazingly delicious! The caramel is wonderful and goes so well with the peanuts and pretzels. When I make caramel popcorn, I put it in a low temp oven, about 250, and let it crisp for at least 45 min, stirring every 15 min to distribute the caramel. Thanks, RookieWife!

I grew up making carmels and candies so I am not a beginner at cooking these on the stovetop. I halfed the recipe to start out and the carmel  didn't even barely cover all the popcorn, and "shaking" the bag won't help distribute the thick, globby carmel. So then I made another 1/2 batch of caramel because I like my popcorn coated and after stirring it enough to get it even some-what coated, I'm left with popcorn mush that I'd be embarrassed to give away to friends. The carmel doesn't even taste that great, anyway.  The best part of this was the tip to spray the brown paper bag with Pam - that really does work. Otherwise, this was a big disappointment.

This treat is addicting beware I could not stop eating it.  I halved the batch and it still made alot.  We are going to try adding M&M's and/or raisins next time.  It is best the day of so make it when you have lots of people around to help you eat it.

I made a 1/2 batch today and can't stop munching.  I'm on a sugar high!  :)  
I cooked only half of my 1/2 batch in the oven and left the other 1/2 and combined the two.  It's a great mixture of crunchy vs. chewy.  It would be really good with pecans.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very Yummy! I've been making a recipe similar to this one for years, and the pretzel addition is awesome!  I do like to put in slightly less corn syrup and add a teaspoon or two of molassas. If you like the molassas flavor it's a nice addition to a great recipe.

Sooooo yummy! I left out the peanuts as I only had the popcorn & pretzels in the house when the craving struck! And if I hadn't left it in the oven too long to get it crispy, it would have been amazing! Ha ha ha! I think that another reviewers suggestion of drizzling a little bit of melted chocolate would have added that extra bit of satisfaction. And ladies... this makes an awesome PMS snack! :)

I was looking for something good to much on and this recipe fit the bill.  I only had white sugar in the pantry so that is what I used. Be careful not to overcook, I burned the sugar in my first attempt, I had boiled it too long.  In my second try I got the sugar to 230 degrees and removed it from the heat. I got a softer, chewier caramel that I like. Thanks for the recipe! I haven't stopped eating it yet!

Made this today, exactly as written, will not be making again as the caramel mixture sticks to your teeth.  I think it has too much popcorn for the amount of caramel mixture, all my peanuts seemed to end up on the bottom of the bowl instead of being "stuck" to everything else.  Sorry.

Yum!  This is very tasty and really pretty easy (and cheap!) to make - the paper bag trick is a good idea but there is so much popcorn in there and the caramel coating kind of made a big puddle in the middle and the bag was almost too heavy to shake very much!  So I shook it but also had to stir it w/ a long wooden spoon, then spread it out on waxed paper to let it dry and get crisp again.  The stuff that I did leave in the bag stuck pretty badly, so I wouldn't recommend leaving the coated popcorn in there.  I also used unsalted dry roasted peanuts and unsalted butter.

Made this one night for munchies for a card party.  It was a hit.  And I like the fact there is really no mess.
The paper bag idea is great. Not to mention I had to give the receipe to my friends.

This really reminded me of Cracker Jacks...only better!!!  I plan on taking it to my next tailgating party.  I didn't change a thing...just make sure you have a big pot or bowl to coat everything well.

Delicious! I might try to find another way to mix it together the next time I make it, a lot of the caramel  was on the bottom of the bag and I couldn't get it to distribute.  Some of it is a little chewy, I think I would put those clusters in the oven next time; but overall a great recipe.

Yum!! I make this around the holidays... line a pretty tin with wax paper and tie up this yummy mixture with a bow. Perfect gift! I agree with the spraying the bag suggestions. I always use a large Stop and Shop bag sprayed lightly with pam. This recipe is a big hit at the parties too! Great munch food!

Yum!!  Rookieswife, my son thanks you for this recipe. I did like the recipe says, and boiled the sugar longer to make it crispier.  It worked like a charm.  Next time, I'll have the salt, vanilla, and baking soda measured out ahead of time.  It took a little too long to measure them out and get them in the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter mixture and it cooled off too much.  So, I had to put it back on the burner to soften it up before I could pour it over the popcorn mixture.

Beware! This is extremely delicious and highly addictive. I made it for a group of older elemtary age children and young teens and they loved it! I bet it would be even better made with mixed nuts or a blend of almonds and cashews. I plan to make it to put in some holiday containers at Christmas time.

YUMMMMM. I only had maple flavored syrup on hand, so I used that instead of the lite corn syrup. I also cut the sugar by 1/3rd.  This will go in my holiday favorites.  Thanks!!

Want to make this even better?  Substitute the hull less popcorn pops for the popped popcorn.  Believe me, it is scrumptious and as someone who can't have regular popcorn because of dietary issues, it is a way to get my popcorn fix!

Tasted really good, but the ides of shaking the mixture in the bag did not work at all.  The caramel sunk to the bottom in a big pile, which meant I had to get in there with a mixing spoon.  It required way too much effort (and strength) to mix everything together.  If I was somehow convinced to make this again, I would make a much smaller batch that I could mix in a large bowl.

This recipe was awesome, but I have to say beware!!!  I cooked a bit longer as suggested and my plastic spoon melted and after eating this delicious popcorn, we started seeing strings of plastic in the carmel... I had to throw it all away and start over!  Defininately delicious and worth making again!  Now I know why recipes call for a wooden spoon!

I madea big batch of this and brought it up for a XMas tree cutting party up in the mountains. Boys was it ever a hit with the little kids (as well as the big kids!).  Next time I won't put so much pretzels (maybe cut in half?).  Also I added melted chocolate and drizzled it onto the carmel popcorn while it was cooling on the baking sheet.  My only other suggestion would be to have a helper stir the popcorn mixture while you pour the carmel sauce.  Or pour a little, then stir, and pour more....My carmel tended to clump up because I poured it all without stiring quickly.

Great recipe, thanks for posting!

Have already made several batches of this wonderful concoction for a take-home from a dessert buffet, and I'm making more as a snack for our annual cookie exchange. Easy to make and love not having to bake in the oven to set the caramel. Dumped my old recipe, this is the only one for me now! I cook for 5 min and it's perfect every time. Thanks for sharing!

YUM! The only thing I'll do differently, next time, is use a BIG pot instead of a paper bag. The mix stuck to the paper and it was difficult to get the nuts and pretzels evenly distributed throughout the popcorn. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!  I reduced the size down to 4 servings since I had only 1 cup of chopped pretzels.  I didn't account for the small amount of caramel, so I burned my first batch of caramel.  The second time I only boiled the sugar mixture until golden brown and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I would also recommend using dry roasted peanuts.  I grabbed cocktail peanuts because it was what I had available and they won't stick to the caramel.  Despite this, I am going to have a hard time saving this popcorn for the kids!

Used 22 cups of popcorn, 3 cups of peanuts and 7 cups of pretzels. I didn't realize I needed for than one bag for the pretzels! I used my son's metal garbage can (I washed first and then greased) and it worked prefectly. I boiled the mixture for 8 minutes and did not put in oven. Stirring was a workout but the end result was great! I didn't have any caramel clumps.

This is it! All of family decided that we don't need cookies for holiday anymore. This is going to be the new thing. It was easy, quick and so delicious. I didn’t have any problem with crunchiness. It was gone in days. My hobby’s co-worker traded his homemade tamales for this Carmel Pretzel Nut Popcorn.

Did not use the paper bag- mixed instead in a large stock pot.  Fun treat to make with the kids.  A big production due to the sheer volume, and was a little disappointed last night.  But chilled it outside overnight and broke it up this morning and I have to say it is very good.  

There was some clumping of the caramel, but then again, those hunks are quite a treat when you dig them out.  I will make this at least once a year, perhaps saving it as a Christmas treat.

Amazing.  I have never really been a fan of popcorn but as we were having a "movie night" at home I decided to try this recipe.  Followed instructions by the book apart from couldn't get corn syrup so made a syrup from sugar and water.  This was a real hit with guests, and I loved it.  Cant wait to try it again

This was pretty good. It made A LOT and we gave most of it as gifts and saved some for us and I was sad when we ended up throwing some of it away. We added M&M's to the mix but other than that kept the recipe the same. I will probably make this again, but maybe just on a smaller scale. Thanks!

Superb!  I loved it just a little bit chewy!  I didn't have success with baking to make it crispy, my sugar crystalized, and I didn't like it as much.  But the other half of the batch that I made as directed was perfect.  Five minutes boiling was right on!  This was my Christmas treat!  I have made 4 batches and I still have 2 more to go!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is an awesome snack recipe. I would recommend the baking at the end, because it helps distribute the caramel more evenly. Also next time I'll cut down on the nuts because I'm not all that fond of peanuts. But it does give it a nice nutty flavor similar to peanut brittle! 5 Stars!

OMG! This is the best carmel corn ever and it is not hard to make. I will never buy carmel corn again! Great for movie nights at home.

Amazing. I worked with 1/2 batches, hand popped popcorn, lightly salted peanuts and pretzels. I used a giant bowl and stirred with a spoon while I poured a little at a time so I avoided any pooling of caramel. I boiled for 7 mins and it turned out perfect. Made for Christmas gifts and can't wait to see reactions.

Awesome.  Like other reviewers, I liberally sprayed Pam over the surface of the bowl that I used to mix the snack in as well as the spoon used to stir and the cookie sheet that I baked it on.  Definitely use it if you can.  It really helps the clean up afterward.

This was a big hit with the group I made it for! I found the mixture difficult to spread about evenly and just a bit more chewy than anticipated for caramel corn.  Outstanding caramel taste though!

I will definitely make this recipe again.  My husband loved it, and it was a big hit with the gathering I prepared it for.  I used mixed nuts in place of peanuts.  I left out the salt since I used salted butter.  I also recommend two roasting pans to mix the full recipe.  I also baked it for 10 minutes, stirred the popcorn and baked it for 5 more minutes.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Delicious!!! Everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly except for putting in oven at 300 for 15 minutes stirring every 5 minutes in two large lasagna pan. Coated properly and enough coating for sure. Served it warm and nobody could get enough.

I made it a second time and this time in the oven the sugar burned when I put it in for 10 minutes at the suggested temp.  So be careful and watch this!  Also, the second time the coating didn't quite cover which is completely odd as last time it did.  In either event this is the most delicious ever! :)

This is very good.  It is as good as the expensive carmel corn you buy and you get a boat load of it.  It would have been better to do this with 2 people.  I used a big pot and you have to work fast mixing it and its difficult if you mix a bit pour a bit etc.  I boiled it 6 min instead of 5 and it was crispy it didn't need to go in the oven.

I eat this popcorn until I have a stomach ache! It's that good. My neighbor says it's the best caramel corn he's ever had. 
I tried making it with cashews instead of peanuts but I found the cashew flavor too bland. The peanuts add the perfect touch to the blend of flavors.

Pretty yummy.  Wasn't too sure about the pretzel pieces.  I think I still prefer traditional caramel corn.

Didn't follow recipe exactly, because I didn't want to make too much. With that being said, it was really sweet. But my kids loved it (even the picky one!)
