Very flavorful, great tasting dip. I cooked for 15 minutes as stated and didn't have any liquid left to drain off. I thought the dip was just a little dry. I ended up adding some liquid from some salsa to it. I thought this would be good cold, like hummus, but it was much better warmed up, even better with some shredded cheese melted on it.
