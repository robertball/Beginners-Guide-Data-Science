Yum!  Love it! I actually tweaked this recipe with the Yummy Vegan Pesto Classico and had to make some subs with  what I had in stock.  I used pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts, Brewer's Yeast replaced the soy cheese. Perfect amount of garlic, and I love the addition of lemon juice. I added a little bit of salt and pepper. I didn't measure how much basil I added.  Thanks for the great vegan pesto recipe, NJChick!

Wow!  This tasted great!  My husband is lactose intolerant so I'm always on the lookout for tasty vegan recipes.  I used sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts just because pine nuts are a little pricey these days.

Super yummy, super easy to make!  I make this in large batches & freeze in little containers so that I can grab it & go.  Even non-vegan hubby loves this recipe!

Wow!!!  I am so excited to have found this recipe.  I love pesto, but eat a dairy-free diet, so finding a recipe I'm happy with is always a challenge.  Any previous pesto I've made just seemed to turn out poorly.  This one is great, and I swear for once the nutritional yeast actually makes me think of cheese (which I so love and miss)!  My modifications were as follows:  I used pecans because it was what I had on hand, I did add a dash of salt and pepper, my herbs were from the garden and I threw in a little oregano, thyme, and lemongrass (since it called for lemon anyway).  I was definitely heaviest on the basil though.  Finally, I added the oil very slowly, because my biggest problem with previous pesto attempts has been too much oil for too few herbs.  A "bunch" is hard to define so I just went slow and...voila - a great pesto!  I probably only used 3 tablespoons of oil, so definitely not a half cup, but I know everyone likes their pesto to slightly different consistencies.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It will definitely be my go-to pesto from now on.
