I used a 28 oz can of Unico Pezzettoni in puree no salt added which combines both tomatoes and paste in one can. I roasted the beets ahead of time and didnâ€™t know what to do with them until I found this perfect soup! It was wonderful and so simple to make.

I rated this soup as a 5-star because most people who have tried beets can't even imagine how good this soup would taste.  I followed the recipe as listed; however, I would top off with a little a favorite cheese, and side with some butter crackers.  Yummy!
