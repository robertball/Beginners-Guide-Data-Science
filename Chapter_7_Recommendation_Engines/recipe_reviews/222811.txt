Thanks for this kicked up pasta salad! I created the dressing as you suggested but changed the other ingredients to my taste. I used onion, cucumber, egg, medium cheddar, and imitation crab. I also added a little bit of old bay and cracked pepper. I think this would taste great with shrimp too!

I have to admit, this recipe's title is what initially stirred my interest.  Then, I continued to be intriguing when I discovered it indeed WASN'T some variation of an italian dressing pasta salad.  I realized I had a little less than a cup of light mayo left, so mine wasn't as dressed as it should be.  Per personal taste, I subbed yellow mustard for Dijon and left out the celery and black olives, while I added some carrot.  I belatedly realized I'd left out the eggs, but next time (and yes, there WILL be a next time) I'll use pickled eggs!  Oh yeah, I'm also lazy, so I subbed "real bacon bits" for bacon.  THANK YOU for a great *different* pasta salad, KB COUNTRYGIRL!  EDIT:  I made this again and added chopped pickled eggs and that was a nice *pop*, both in flavor and color.  I also made using green onions, as opposed to red, since I was making it for a crowd ad green tend to be a bit milder and I really missed the crunch, and bite, of the red onion.

Pretty tasty! The add-in's are great. I'd 1/2-2/3 the red onion. Do not use mayonnaise - use Miracle Whip!! It's sweetness counters the vinegar. It's needed.

I was looking for a pasta salad recipe to go with burgers for dinner but I didnâ€™t want the usual mayonnaise-y kind.  I was a little hesitant after looking at the ingredients, because a few ingredients I have never seen in a pasta salad, but wow!  This is delicious!  This will be my new go-to recipe for pasta salad.  The only thing I omitted were water chestnuts (my husband hates them) and olives (I hate them).  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this at the last minute on the fly and it was very tasty. I had to leave out olives and bell peppers since I didn't have them available but it was still delicious. I love the vinegar taste it has, but I will personally not use quite as much. Will absolutely make again

i really liked this pasta salad, especially the dressing.  it had good depth of flavor.  for us, it had a bit too much vinegar, hence the 4 stars.  i had even redued the amount i used from the recipe amount but it was still too much.  otherwise i will be making this again!

My crew and I really like this version but I did need to make another 1/2 recipe of the dressing. I generally make this type of salad a day in advance to let the flavors meld a bit more and it just gets too dry without the additional dressing. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick that we like.  Definitely enjoy this flavorful creamy dressing more than the standard V&O based standard for pasta salad.

This was ok, but I found it a bit on the dry side and lacking in flavor.   After making it as directed, letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours and sampling, I adding in about another 2/3 cup Miracle Whip, 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of Lawry's Seasoned Salt.   Everyone liked it, but I didn't get any big raves.   I love all the hard ingredients, but I'm just so-so about the sauce.

I just made this tonight.  It's a great change.  I made it just as recipe stated but since daughter is a vegetarian left out bacon and topped with some tuna.  I will keep this recipe!  Bacon would be delicious though!

This is a nice variation from oil and vinegar pasta salad. And as another reviewer stated- the name is what initially had me taking a second look at this recipe. You can vary the ingredients and make it taste more like potato salad or keep it as is. Either way this is a tasty recipe that I will be making over and over again. Very well received by a pack of hungry teenagers at our last bonfire and bbq.

I made this for my family over the 4th of July.  It went over really well and I had two guests ask for the recipe.  I did cut the vinegar in half (per other review) and just used all red pepper instead of green pepper.  It really was amazing and I will be making this one again!
