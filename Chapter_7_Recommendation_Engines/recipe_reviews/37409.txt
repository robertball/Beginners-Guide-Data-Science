This is like a meal you would find at a fine restaurant.  I have made this several times and played around w/ the ingredients, but it always came out the best when I followed the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of the amount of garlic (I use a full bulb).  I have tried serving this over different types of pasta, but plain or organic wheat angel hair are by far the best for this; they best complement the overall delicacy of the meal.  It is also great as an appertizer with soft bread.  

One thing I find important is to not over cook the shrimp so that they do not get hard.  I think the point of this recipe is to keep it light and tender all around.  I watch the shrimp the whole time and as soon as they are all pink I take them off the heat, but leave them in the pan while serving.  This recipe reqires close attention and babysitting, but it is pretty fast and as outstanding as it is, it deserves the attention while being cooked.  A+

I was a bit nervous about the size of the garlic chunks, but the cooking time was enough that they were nice and tender.  We ate it with bread to mop up the juice - next time we do this I am going to reduce the liquids a bit more before adding the shrimp.  The amount of sauce would have been just right for pasta.

This recipe was good, but I thought there was way too much wine taste. I think I'll leave out the white wine vinegar next time & just use the real wine. I also minced the garlic instead of halves and I didn't use the peppers, just the crushed red pepper. To subdue the "too much wine" taste, I added a slight amount of flour & milk which also made the sauce a bit thicker and a touch of sugar. I can only give three stars since it was just too strong as original. Will try again in my own version, Thanks for the idea.

Wonderful combination!  I didn't add the dried chile peppers b/c I didn't have them on hand, but added fresh mushrooms and a few chopped green onions.  Since I wanted this as a dinner , I added cooked angel hair to the pan and let the flavors immerse for a few minutes before serving.  Not that the sauce needed anything but I tried adding 2T. half n half to give the pasta and shrimp a more creamy constistency. It was a great addition. Then I reseasoned with old bay.  This was delicious with garlic bread!!  Thank you for such an inspiring recipe!!

I made this dish last night as a main dish it was absolutely wonderful. I am, as my name states a "new cook" and let me tell you this is a fool-proof dish.  The only thing I would do next time is increase the amount of sauce if you are going to serve over pasta.

This recipe was very good.  I made several changes to it after reading other reviews.  I doubled the sauce and used the extra to pour over the rice and peas I made to accompany it.  I also ommited the vinegar, although I don't think it would have been bad with it.  I used 3 tsp.ground rosemary instead of fresh, and added a chopped shallot and 1/4 cup heavy cream.  I reduced the oil to 2 tbsp and only used half of the garlic called for.  After eating it, it was a big hit in our house. It definately would have been to garlicy with the stated amount though.  Overall, I will definately make this again!

This was one of the best recipes I have taken off this site!  We left out all of the red pepper ingredients, and it turned out terrific with a couple quick dashes of Old Bay seasoning.  Served it over bow tie pasta.  It really did make a delicious dish with little to no effort at all (I did leave the tails on).  I'll definitely make this again!

Wow.  Yum.  A big hit in our house.  Easy, delicious and the kids ate it up.  One note: a pound didn't serve four here, even with kids being some of the eaters.  The second time I increased just the shrimp, and there was still plenty of sauce.  I will definitely make this ag ain.

This was absolutely fabulous.  We ate it over spaghetti noodles with broiled garlic bread.  All we needed was a nice bottle of wine and it would have been perfect.

I did not have white wine and so used cooking sherry (I omitted the salt since the sherry is so salty).  And I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar...still, great.

This whipped up to make a quick lunch served over pasta.  To save yourself time, get pre-peeled shrimp so you don't have to hassel with peeling the shrimp yourself.  Served over linguini pasta with french bread and a caesar salad.

Just the right amount of spices and seasoning.  We made this on a "steak and shrimp" night and served with rosemary/garlic red potatoes.  Great recipe !!

Whoa.........this is super!!  I had never fixed anything with dried red peppers so thought this might be too hot for my taste but it's not.  Also, I didn't exactly know how to use them so I just cut them into strips.  This is definately a keeper and I cannot wait to fix it for my guests who are real dippers. I have grown rosemary in my garden for the first time and looking for something to do with it.  Also think the oil would be good for dipping even without the shrimp.

This is the best shrimp recipe I've ever come across!  The shrimp have a wonderful flavor and are perfect alone, as an appetizer, or as a main dish.

Love it!  We always prefer it over spinach linguine.  So the shrimps don't turn out too rubbery as one person complained, I fry them seperately and add them in for the last few minutes.  Also cut the big cloves of garlic in half so they cook quicker.

Followed the recipe except for the vinegar (per other reviews) and used dried herbs instead of fresh and this was way too strong for our tastes.  Didn't even put the full amount of rosemary and the flavor was overpowering - after serving and tasting this dish, I took it back to the sink to rinse off half of the herbs & sauce to make it edible.  Will definitely not try again.

This was delicous! I followed other reviewers' recommendations and skipped the white wine vinegar. It had the perfect balance of wine flavor and herb flavors. I used dried rosemary, which was fine but added a gritty texture to the sauce (dried rosemary is very pokey). It was still great though, and very fast and easy! As a plus, it also fragranced my whole house with a beautiful herb smell.

Delicious!  I reduced the garlic to half a bulb & minced it instead of cutting the bulb and using the whole thing.  It turned out fantastic!

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  As another suggested, we also put it over bowtie pasta.  I used dried tabasco peppers from my garden instead of the red chile peppers.  It was just wonderful.  Next time I make it, I will mince the garlic, as the whole garlic cloves did not give as much flavor as hoped.  Otherwise though, just fabulous!  Thanks so much, this goes into the normal rotation.

I used this recipe for a dinner party full of hungry college kids and every single one of them loved it. Even for a beginner like myself I found this easy to prepare and had fantastic results even with using only half of the garlic necessary!  I will definitely be using this over and over again.
