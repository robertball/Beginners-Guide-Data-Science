This is a very easy and quick recipe and my family loved it.  However, I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken and it turned out great.  Also, I suggest that you add a little bit of cayenne pepper and seasoning salt because it is pretty bland without it.  Served over rice and steamed broccoli.  Delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

Very Good! I didn't have the garlic, or onion on hand but used garlic salt and onion powder along with Italian seasoning to season the chicken.  Will try next time with the "real" garlic and add some onion.  Turned out great.

5 stars on the dish i made which a variation of this one.  I cooked brown rice in my rice cooker as i cooked the rest of this. sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms in olive oil, then added chicken. After chicken cooked I added the cream of mush soup, water, salt, pepper and curry powder.  served it over brown rice and baked brussel sprouts on the side.  So yummy!!!

It was a bit bland like the other reviews said. I tried to add a bit of white wine to the chicken while it was cooking. I then added curry and mixed frozen veggies, and it turned out pretty tasty! All in all, after a bit of tweaking it was pretty good for how simple and easy it was.

Okay, so I changed a lot about this recipe. I used one large can of Campbell's cream of mushroom, I used 2/3 the amount of garlic, I used about twice as much chicken, I used brown mushrooms instead of white, and I also didn't add any water. I wanted it really creamy. In fact I drained the chicken and mushrooms before adding the soup and pasta. I also double the recipe as a whole.

I made this last night for dinner. I added chicken stock instead of water and added broccoli. I also added cayenne pepper for some kick. It was pretty tasty. I would recommend this and have fun by making it your own.

The sauce needs a little more flavor, so I added some sour cream. That being said, I'd still make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. As is, I think it would be a little bland. I added a tsp of minced garlic, a tsp of crushed red pepper and red curry paste along with the recommended curry powder. Really added nice flavor with a thai spin. I also added onion, red pepper and frozen broccoli. It was a really solid meal.

It's very good, just a tip: DO NOT ADD THE PEPPER. It's a lot more than you think and my whole dish was flecked with pepper and it's taste. Too much! Should of thought twice. Otherwise the rest of the meal is superb! Would definately make it again, just no pepper!

Changed out Mushroom soup for cream of chicken and it was awesome.  Toss some cherry tomatoes in whole while cooking the chicken.

Make this almost every week now! Really tasty, easy, cheap and guilt-free! I like to throw mushrooms in and kick up the red pepper, personally but great idea!

It was fairly easy to make and it was filling. I think it lacked a bit of kick for taste. Taste was blah. I have to think what I can add to make it a bit taster without sacrificing it been a healthy dish.

So easy to make. Great for low calorie but without the low calorie taste. Made this for my husband and he loves it. No need to tell him it is low calorie :)

Very good! However, I added some Cajun seasoning and hot sauce because it was a tad bland. Overall it was a good healthy recipe and I'm definitely making it again.

Pretty good basis for the meal. Agree with the others, it was a little bland. If you like spicy, as I do, I added Cajun seasoning and a sprinkle of an Italian blend cheese! Yum!

I took the advice of many users and added more seasonings, but it still tasted like something was missing. It's edible, but very bland. The crushed red pepper makes it bland and spicy. I won't be making this again.
