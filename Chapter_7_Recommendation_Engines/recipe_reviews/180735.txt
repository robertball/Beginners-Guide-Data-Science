This was great! I made it using dairy products instead of making it vegan however I still kept it vegetarian by using the ground beef substitute. I also used butter in the mashed potatoes instead of cream cheese because I didn't have any. I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian recipes since recently becoming one and this is one I will definitely make again!!

Made this for Christmas. My brother's girlfriend is vegan, has been for several years, and we always feel bad because we're a meat and potatoes family and don't now what we can really feed her. This turned out quite well. She described it as "decadent" and my brother had seconds and thirds. Leftovers were finished at dinner tonight. Definitely keeping this one in my recipe box!  My parents rated it as a 4. Put a little salt in the bottom half of the dish, and I think it really will earn that 5 star rating!

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes to suit my tastes - I added mushrooms and pie crusts (I guess I made more of a "pot pie") Very yummy, and filling.  I thought the mashed potato layer was fabulous.  I would make this again, thanks for submitting!

Had been wanting to make this for a while and finally got around to it last night. OMG!!! Absolutely amazing! I made a couple of minor adjustments, mostly just to speed it up. I subbed instant potatoes, prepared just according to package instructions (just easier). I also subbed a  whole bag of frozen peas and carrots (15 oz or so) rather than using the scant half cup of peas + fresh carrots. Like another reviewer, I forgot the tomato and just added some ketchup, along with about half a cup of veggie bouillion to keep it moist. I also added a generous squirt of Sriracha. It was delicious!!! My boyfriend, who converted to vegetarianism about a year ago, said it is one of his favorite dishes that I have made. Since I left out the mayo, cream cheese, and oil in the potatoes, and only used a splash of olive oil to saute the veggies in, this was also a very low fat dish. So much better than we ever expected it to be!!!! A definite keeper.

Yum! Instead of using meat substitute i used a can of red kidney beans and 3/4 cup of red lentils, and i added twice the amount of Italian seasoning, and a couple more garlic cloves. Turned out great!

The potatoes alone get 5 stars. I wanted to eat them all out of the bowl before they made it to the oven! I followed the recipe as written except I added cheese to the potatoes. I used Daiya cheddar substitute because it's soy and gluten free. Yum!! I followed the bottom layer recipe almost exactly, though I used green beans and broccoli instead of tomatoes and peas (don't like them), and added mushrooms. For the meat substitute I used Boca crumbles. This is definitely going on rotation in my house!! Thank you.

Thank you for sharing this recipe - it's fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and my sons and husband devoured everything.  I couldn't find vegan mayo or cream cheese so used regular (I didn't add oil to my potatoes).  This was the first time I used soy cheese and enjoyed that too.  Loved this recipe and will definitely make again.

This was very good, but I will make a few changes next time...i was not crazy about the Italian seasoning....and i think I will put cheese on top of the veggie mixture as well as on topp of the mashed potatoes.....but still very yummy, tastes great with ketchup.

This was fantastic!  My carnivore husband loved it.  I added A1 to the "meat mixture".  I use Match meat.  I also substituted the oil with Earth Balance margerine and used less milk and mayo.  It couldn't have been a better dish.  would be great for company.

I have never had traditional Shepherd's pies but my husband said he used to love it before he became a vegetarian.  It came out absolutely fabulous!  Even my five year old son didn't say a word about all the veggies in it and finished his whole plate.

Delicious Comfort Food!   After 8 years of marriage my husband finally converted to vegetarianism and asked to have this instead of turkey at Thanksgiving - delicious!!  I changed the recipe to use what I had on hand and did use real dairy but it still turned out fabulously!  Absolutely 5 stars!

Made this vegetarian rather than vegan. Used half instant, half mashed red potatoes with butter and sour cream. Totally forgot we needed a tomato, so followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a bit more than half a can of veg broth, about a tbsp of butter & a little flour. Also for lack of tomato, threw in a few squirts of ketchup and a splash of soy sauce.  So delicious!

I made this the vegan way as described and it was wonderful!  I substituted margarine for the olive oil in the potatoes because I wanted a more buttery taste.  I also used a vegan pie crust and made the entire dish in a pie plate.  It came out wonderful!  I highly recommend Daiya brand soy cheese, it's the best!

Wow! This was out of this world delicious!!!  I have been making more vegan dishes for health reasons and thought I would try this one out.  I cooked the recipe exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.  It was so good my husband asked me if I had in fact thrown ground beef in it.  The next day he had two more servings for breakfast!!  Thanks Laura for submitting such a great recipe!!

Delicious!  I made some substitutions.  I used Italian sausage imitation crumbles since the beef crumbles were out.  Also not a vegan so I used normal mayo, milk, cheese, cream cheese.  Oddly enough I'm not big on vegetables but this is a great way to prepare them.

Surpisingly, I loved this and will make it again.  I felt as if it wanted more flavoring but not quite sure what.  I will play with it next time.  Maybe some Worcestershire would help?

I made this with a couple of alterations as I am vegetarian, not vegan. I made the mashed potato with instant mash; I didnt use the olive oil or the cream cheese. For the bottom layer, I used sweetcorn as I didn't have any peas. I also added some veggie worcester sauce. It was meant to be a couple of tbps but ended up about twice as much as it sloshed in quicker than i expected! However, this seemed to add a special touch as the children were fighting for extras! Nobody noticed the topping was made from instant mash and I would make it this way again. A successful family meal in my opinion

Used real dairy products and sour cream instead of mayo. also used a suggestion by another reviewer and substituted 3/4 bag of frozen peas and carrots. Very good; even the picky 3 year old asked for seconds!

I liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was I used real beef. I think next time I would sub earth balance margaine for the olive oil because the olive oil flavor was overpowering.  It was a good solid meal though. Thanks for the recipe.

This was soooo delicious! My only substitutes were rice milk instead of soy milk (was good, but want to try hemp milk next time) and rice "cheddar" instead of soy "cheddar". Potato mixture was a bit too liquid and "beef" crumbles were too crumbly. Will make adjustments for these next time. Thank you for this amazing vegan recipe!

SOOOO yummy, and so easy because I had everything on hand except zucchini.    I used dried potato flakes because they were what I had, and mixed in some packaged vegan mushroom gravy with the ground beef substitute based on other reviews.  I will definitely make this over and over, though most likely leaving out the tomatoes because for me, they didn't really add anything.

DE-licious! I made this tonight and it was a big hit!  I substituted zucchini for celery and used extra garlic.  Next time I will use just a little less salt and a bigger baking pan!

this was awesome. the potatoes are to die for (and i didn't even use cheese). switch up the vegetables to your liking, it works with anything. just goes to show that being vegan isn't hard at all.

Amazing... I followed the recipe exact except I didn't have Italian seasoning so I improvised.  Used Daiya soy cheese... so good!  I put the casserole dishes under the broiler for the last 5 minutes because I am impatient.

This is the best vegan recipe we’ve found on this site thus far. Technically, we made this vegetarian since subbing dairy cream cheese and cheddar cheese for soy products. For the mashed potatoes, subbed almond milk for soy milk, added 1/8 cup light ranch dressing, reduced the olive oil to 1/8 cup, added finely chopped parsley, and omitted the salt. Doubled the bottom layer, and subbed Sazón Tropical for the Italian seasoning. Used 2 (10 ounce) packages Marjon Tofu Crumbles, Politely Hot which enhanced the flavor. Used a 3 quart baking dish; baked for 25 minutes and then broiled on high for about two minutes to slightly brown the cheese. Great recipe, VeggieChefLaura, and hope you share some other ones.

This came out really well...it gets 4stars because of minor changes. In my regular beef shephards pie the recipe calls for 1/2 c of beef gravy on the meat mix. Since this is the veggie version i thickened 1/2 c of veggie broth with flour for veggie gravy. The potato mix on top...seemed awfully high in fat content so i cut in half the mayo milk and oil. It came out just fine. My daughter has been bugging me lately that we need to eat healthier. So....i made this version and she was horrfied that i messed with the traditional shep pie that she likes. She was prepared to hate it.....and went back for seconds.

OMG. This was delicious. As a new vegetarian this recipe was interesting however I used sea salt as a substitute and cut it in half the second time since I am not a fan of salt. But other that that this meal choice was great and easy to make.

Yummy and easy to make.  I used instant mashed potatoes, ground turkey (browned separately on the stove), real cream cheese, and real mayo.  I didn't have any italian seasoning so I used fresh basil, dried oregano, and one bay leaf (removed before baking).  The only drawback for me is that the meat/veggie mixture isn't very gravy-like.

This turned out amazing! I kept it totally vegan, but used garlic and chive flavored vegan cream cheese and left out the italian seasoning.

Very good! Just recently turned vegan & my sister passed on this recipe to me.  It is so good! It's worth all the work.  Silly me, not thinking, chopped up all my veggies with a Pampered Chef chopper rather than sticking them all in the food processor.  I highly recommend doing that instead.  Even my meat-loving, non- vegan fiancee LOVED this! Enjoy!

Since we're not vegan or vegetarian, we cook it without all of the substitute ingredients.  It is really good (and by far the easiest I've tried to make)!

My big changes:  1) we use instant mashed potatoes and only add 4-5 tablespoons of neufchatel cheese to them; it helps if your mashed potatoes stay thick; 2) we use half the amount of carrots and celery; 3) we double the onion; 4) we use about 1.5 C green beans instead of peas; 5) we add about 2 tablespoons regular breadcrumbs to the bottom layer right before you put it in the baking dish; 6) we use ground turkey.  When using the ground turkey (or any meat), it can get too oily, so we don't use any of the vegetable oil, and we drain the meat (and add breadcrumbs).

I served this to my family, and it was declared by all to be very good. 
I only used the recipe for the bottom part. I used my favourite Mashed recipe for the top layer.

This was incredible! I made it exactly as the recipe with the exception of throwing a handful of kale into the pan of veggies simply because I had it and didn't want it to go to waste. I used a mozzarella style soy cheese because that's what was on hand, although I may try a cheddar style next time. This was great period, not just "great for vegan." Some other reviewers mentioned how wonderful the mashed potato mixture is alone and I agree! I am planning to keep this recipe on hand for the potatoes as a side dish with other meals. The only thing I would change is the 2 qt. dish. I filled mine to the brim and had a good amount of veggies and potatoes left. Will use a larger dish next time.

I made this Shepherd's Pie as it gets such great reviews, but I found the bottom dry very dry.  The mashed potatoes were good, but overall it was nothing special.

My brother's specialty is Shepherd's Pie so when he came over and saw that I had made a vegetarian version he was actually offended! Ha! He couldn't believe how good it was though and now I'm offended he ate the last piece!
:) Very good!!!

Thank you for posting this!  It was so good!  I used vegan sour cream in place of vegan mayo in the potato layer because that's what I had on hand.  Did not use cheese because I didn't have any.  Still awesome, I will make again.  Thank you!

Brilliant. Takes awhile to make, but it's worth it. A very flexible recipe-- can use whatever veggies/meat substitutes you have. I used veggie burgers instead of fake ground beef and it came out with a wonderful taste.

Yum!  We loved it.  Next time I would leave the salt out of the potatoes though, it wasn't necessary and made it pretty salty.  I am sure it would be just as delicious without it, or with a lot less.

Thanks for a great recipe. I had to alter it, as I didnt have some ingredients on hand. I used instant potatoes but used Tofutti & Trader Joes soy creamer and added fresh thyme. I didnt have fresh or canned tomatos so I used a veg broth and used margarine ad a little four.

This was really a great recipe.  I made it for a vegan potluck I hosted a couple weeks ago.  It was a hit!  The mashed potatoes were awesome-- I was a little skeptical about using veganaise but it was really decadent.  I'm making this again for dinner tonight.  I skipped the soy cheese on top-- it's so rich as it is.  Thanks for sharing this.

This was very simple to make and it was delicious! My entire family of meat eaters enjoyed it. I especially loved the mashed potatoes and will use this recipe for my mashed potatoes in the future. I substituted soy creamer for the soy milk and worked wonderfully!

Love love love it! I only made small tweaks... small red potatoes, grated zucchini, beef stock soaked TVP and some nutritional yeast flakes to the potato and meat mixture - that's it. But after re-reading the recipe, I see I left out the italian seasoning, tomato and garlic... but no one was the wiser.  The "stop-trying-to-make-me-vegan" hubby and "I-don't-like-anything" 3 year old scarfed it down AND requested the pie for the next day's lunch

I had never eaten Shepherds pit before and have nothing to compare it to, but this is a wonderful
dish, easy to make, can be adjusted with other ingredients and I agree with one of the other reviewers, it was hard not to eat the mashed potatoes before the pie was put together.  Next time I'll try putting in some mushroom.  Yummers!

Made this last night with a few twists. I used veggie ground meat but all dairy products. I omitted the olive oil and cream cheese in the potatoes and added 1 6oz container of plain greek yogurt and about 1.5 TBSP margarine. I also used 8 or 9 baby gold potatoes which i think give a better flavor in mashed potatoes. For the bottom layer I omitted the celery & tomato, but added a can of creamed corn. In assembly I cooked the meat by itself first in onion & garlic and  also with about a TBSP of worcestershire plus a tsp or so each of beef powder and onion powder, then I set that aside on another plate. (TIP- because veggie meat doesn't "crumble" like regular meat, I used a potato masher to ground it up while cooking and it worked great)I sauteed the veggies in the same pan in a little oil adding the other seasonings, then I added the meat. I also tried using a pie crust on the bottom but the next time I won't do that, because it made it taste too much like pastry. The rest turned out pretty darn yummy!! I liked this recipe as a starting point, I'm always one to put my own signature on stuff!

a good base recipe that can be easily altered to include dairy and meat (and a handy way to use up leftover turkey-tofu meatloaf).  One time-saving hint - use a cast iron skillet for sauteeing the veggies and meat/meat substitute and then top with the mashed potato layer and put into the oven -no need for a separate casserole dish

I hate reviews that don't stick to the original recipe, however since I only made some minor changes, and since it was so good, I'm reviewing it and giving it 5 stars. For the potatoes I just added a bit of vegan cream cheese, some earth balance, and a splash of soy creamer. Since others commented on the bottom layer being dry I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a tomato and it kept things really moist.  Not a fan of vegan cheese so I left that off.  I served it with the vegetarian gravy recipe from this site and it was perfect. None of us were really fans of traditional shepherds pie before we were vegan, but everyone loved this. Try it!

This is the best way I've found to use up the bounty of winter veggies from our CSA.  We have lots of potatoes, and I've been successful in adding all sorts of vegetables (carrots, parsnips, turnips, celery) to the veggie mix.  I omit the faux-meat and add mashed beans (white, garbanzo) instead.  I also double the spices used.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out good- replaced the soy and vegan items with whole milk items. Used veggie meat- tasted just like real meat when it was all done. Used zucchini in place of celery and a couple dabs of Worcestershire sauce - boyfriend loved it! I thought it was good; just am not too fond of meaty dishes; was surprised by how much this tasted like the real thing. Edit: I've made this several times since. I love putting Worcester sauce in the mixture and as a garnish. I've added more stars since I've really come to appreciate this dish.

This was delicious.  Even better the next day.  We used soy ground beef, but used regular dairy for the rest.

I would technically give this recipe 4.5 stars because I think a nice mushroom gravy on the inside of the pie would be delicious. Changes: 
I omitted: the tomato, ground "beef", used 4 red potatoes, omitted the olive oil, "cheese" and cream cheese in the potato crust. 
I added: diced green beans, scallions, paprika, poultry seasoning, cajun seasoning, diced tofu marinated in soy sauce and liquid smoke, and 4 tablespoons of Chalula hot sauce to the potatoes. 

I wish I'd had some Daiya to sprinkle on top though.

I thought this recipe was fabulous - my carnivore husband said "not bad" which is as much enthusiasm as he can muster for something with soy meat substitute.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but added green beans and substituted 1 can of organic tomato sauce instead of the chopped tomato.  I also sprinkled in a little worchestershire sauce and increased the Italian seasoning.  The mashed potatoes I made exactly as the recipe reads.  We ate it with ketchup, as others suggested.  Definitely a homestyle comfort food type recipe.  Even though it's kind of time intensive, I'll make it again.  My prep time was more like 40 minutes and total time until ready was about an hour and a half.  But worth it!

Recently exploring the Vegan food train.  This is my second meal after Hummus.  Yes, this is truly my second attempt at Vegan food.  All I can say is "wow".  Secretly, I keep thinking how wonderful this would be with an egg and some bacon, but it is not needed.  This is really a great meal for about ten people as printed.  I am not sure the pseudo cheese is really needed on top.  I have to admit I am shocked at how expensive the ingredients were! Still worth every penny!  Kudos to the Chef. Thank you.

A big hit!  I expanded the ingredients to 1 1/2 x to amply feed everyone. I added veggie broth and a veggie bouillon for some flavor and needed liquid, and threw in some frozen corn and red beans, and 1 tsp of salt.  It was delicious, and the mashed potatoes were great.

I made this last night for mu husband and our grandson.  There were NO left overs.  Nest time I will make a double batch.  I made it with the red kidney beans and it was AWESOME.  We are doing a 21 day Daniel Fast and it is a wonderful dish with no meat.  I have loved the traditional way with the ground beef but I think I prefer this recipe over the traditional.

Yummy!  Even my carnivorous children and husband enjoyed it... no leftovers!  I followed the recipe exactly... until I finished the "meat" and veggie mix and decided it was too dry.  I added a box of crushed tomatoes with basil to the meat mixture and it was super duper delish!  I will add this to the rotation for sure and make it again.

This recipe tasted great-  Me and my boyfriend both thought it was yummy (he is not a vegetarian/vegan, I am)  I used morning star crumbles as the meat substitute.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning and I had to cook the veggies a little longer- about 25 minutes total to get them soft.  I used a little veggie broth and covered my pan to let them cook thoroughly.  The potatoes were delicious on their own, the addition of mayonnaise and cream cheese was very tasty.  Overall an easy, satisfying meal-  we will be eating it again tonight : )

I doubled the recipe, and did not add meat substitutes. To create a healthier dish, I made the potatoes only using a little butter, milk and garlic salt. I used a splash of olive oil (instead of vegetable) to sauté the veggies. I added 1/2 bag of frozen broccoli, 4 oz. of mushrooms, a squirt of ketchup, and a splash of soy sauce because I was out of tomatoes. I only added shredded cheddar cheese to the top of the potatoes. It made enough food for one meal for a family of four.

Tried this recipe for a dinner party particularly for my vegan sister-in-law.....she is a fantastic cook and she raved at how tasty this was..and many of the carnivores agreed! We topped it with a fabulous mushroom vegan gravy which was just like putting the icing on the cake!!!!Will definitely make again.

Greasy,  heavy,  and unsatisfying. IThe dish didn't take shape, and overall felt less like shepherd's pie and more like loaded mashed potatoes. The dish felt under seasoned and became palatable only after liberal application of salt and Frank's hot sauce.

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly at first, but the mashed potatoes were a complete fail for me. Not sure why but all the vegannaise, cream cheese, milk and olive oil made my potatoes way too runny. Anyway, I decided to make the potatoes again and this time I just made it the way I know, using Earth Balance vegan butter, rice milk and a bit of salt. Once this was done, I followed the rest of the recipe and it came out great. Also, I don't think the cheese is necessary, but that is my personal preference. Next time I make this, I will leave out the cheese and try subbing zucchini for the celery.

This is delicious! Used dairy products, including some low fat options. We did feel like the mashed potato layer was a little thick, so I'd suggest either using a wider dish, or maybe using less potatoes. Also the "meat" & veg part was pretty crumbly, so I wonder if there's a way to keep it together more... (haven't read the comments yet to see if someone else figured it out!)

Wonderful recipe. Took to a Christmas potluck where, by chance, the host had made a beef version.  Some guests told me they preferred my vegan version. 

Two small changes: added a splash of vegan Worcestershire sauce.  Also, since I mistakenly bought vegan sour cream rather than vegan cream cheese... used the vegan sour cream but added a little nutritional yeast. Delicious!

By the way, I used Lightlife Smart Ground crumbles and Daiya cheddar-style vegan cheese.

Made this special for my sister who's vegan, and not only was she floored on how good it was, but the rest of my family had no idea it was vegan. They all loved it and I have to admit, best I've ever had.

Made this for myself plus 3 highly carnivorous men in Nebraska.  They all loved it.  And believe me, these guys wouldn't lie just to be polite.  This is by far, the best vegan recipe I have ever tried.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Amazing and delicious. My boyfriend tells me that this is one of the best things I've made. 

My only big change was to cook the vegetables in vegetable broth. It allowed me to cut down on the oil that I would have otherwise cooked them in, and brought out the flavor. 

Also, we used fresh thyme and rosemary, and that worked out quite well.

This was good!  Instead of the carrots and celery, I added about a cup of mixed frozen chopped carrots, corn and peas.  I didn't follow the mashed potato recipe; I just made traditional buttermilk potatoes and used regular grated sharp cheddar cheese on the top.  I've never had "traditional" shepherd's pie so I have nothing to compare this to, but I will definitely make this again!

Really good recipe. I did use real mayo, cream cheese and shredded cheese. Everything else was the same as the recipe. I really love the mashed potatoes. The boyfriend went back for seconds.

Great! I added mushrooms. I also cut the mayo in half. Next time I will probably sub a little more soy milk and a little butter for the mayo.

This was super yummy. My only modifications were that I added a few mushrooms to the veggies, and instead of using 1 large onion, I added half a medium onion & the white part of a leek. 
As others mentioned, the mashed potatoes were yummy, but they were really salty which was fine because there is no salt added to the veggie/fake meat portion. I would make the vegan potatoes again, but with "garlic salt to taste". 
All in all, a great recipe, the starch really helped in the day after effects of St. Pattys Day, and the meat eating bf that doesn't fancy shepherds pie too much liked it too. Thanks for the recipe!
Also, i think a good tip for this recipe is to let it cool just a bit before serving so the food has some time to set.

I made this recipe with ground chicken thigh as I can't have egg/dairy, but can still eat meat. I couldn't find any "vegan cream cheese", so I didn't add it to the mashed potatoes. I did everything else as directed except putting the vegan cheddar cheese on top, I instead sprinkled the top with garlic powder and paprika. It turned out great! The potatoes did have a soy taste to them, but the next day the flavour of everything else made it extremely difficult to notice. Overall I thought this was delicious! A dish I won't mind eating all week!

This was great. I changed a few things – I used instant potatoes, as others have said. I'm sure it didn't taste QUITE as good, but it was still tasty. I also put the whole thing in a pie crust instead of a baking dish.
Turned out so well! I'll definitely be making this again.

Wow this is delicious.  I used TVP reconstituted in vegetable broth instead of the fake meat.  Plus I added 3/4 cup toasted chopped walnuts.  Even the meat eaters loved it and went back for seconds.  Very flavorful.  Real comfort food.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting.

Wow! This was my first try of shepherd's pie, and I absolutely loved it! My son ate a plate full of veggies, albeit covered in ketchup. Still a win! We will most certainly make this again and again.

Hi. I used Beyond Burger for my meat, and added three jalapeños, to give a little extra zest. I also used about 3-4x the amount of cheese and substituted cauliflower for the vegan cream cheese. I just boiled the cauliflower along with the potatoes and whipped them at the same time. I have found that cauliflower makes the mashed potatoes creamier tasting.   It was very good, and I will definitely make it again, especially when we have a large dinner party. The recipe as written makes a huge casserole (note the recipe calls for 5 russet potatoes for the topping). If you are feeding 2-3 people, you may want to reduce the number of potatoes and other ingredients, and you will still have a lot of food for leftovers.

Finally, a classic shepherds pie recipe for vegans / vegetarians! Generally they try to reinvent the wheel with some of these recipes, but I found this one to be perfect.  I'm ovo lacto vegetarian so I used regular dairy but other than that didn't change a thing.  Well actually I added a can of corn to the mix as well and it was so, so delicious.  My meat eating husband absolutely loved it and we are looking forward to leftovers tonight. Also, the 8 month old and 4 year old liked it as well. I'll take that as a win!!

I added a 5oz can of tomato paste to the meat mixture, with about a cup of water and two Not-Beef Boullion Cubes. I didn’t put the Italian seasoning in. It was delicious.

Wonderful recipe!! I also used diary things as I'm vegetarian and not vegan.  The only changes I made was I left out the olive oil for the potatoes as I didn't feel it needed it.  I also forgot celery but had frozen corn so i added about 3/4 cup of it instead, and put extra peas in as well.  I took a note from a few other reviewers and added a layer of cheese below the potatoes as well as on top.  My meat eating husband said it was one of the best recipes I've made him! Thank you!

This dish is delicious!  Instead of cooking with the russet potatoes, I used sweet potatoes and almond milk instead of soy milk.  It turned out wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is great. I made a few changes for what I had on hand. I omitted the mayo, and used earth balance instead of cream cheese in the potatoes.
For the "meat" layer I added a vegan onion gravy packet and the required water to keep it from being dry and it was sooo good!!

This recipe was amazing!! I used butter instead of oil and added some garlic powder to the mashed potatoes as well. I also added some brown gravy (mushroom would work too) and I think it made a big difference in a good way! The vegan meat was moist and flavorful! Yum

OMG this was really delicious!  I have always loved a good Shepard’s pie from a real Irish Pub and this holds up against my high expectations!  I followed the recipe with a couple of minor changes, I used thyme instead of Italian seasoning and added a little salt and Worcestershire.  This will be a new fave!

This was good! The seasonings are nice and one could certainly play around with them. Next time I will try a rosemary & thyme mix. This would also be good with mashed sweet potatoes on top. Will make again.

Great recipe! We had never used vegan mayo or cream cheese before so this recipe was a great intro to using them! Overall it tasted great. Will definitely be making again!

I used instant potatoes and made it according to directions (6 - 1/2 cup servings), I also added cream cheese instead of mayo.
Instead of Italian seasoning I added oregano, cummin, thyme, onion powder and black pepper (a sprinkle of all). Because I like making my own seasoning when it comes to this type of food. 

Delicious!!

Not bad but didn’t care for the Italian seasoning. So would switch that out. But other than that, it tastes pretty good!

(Sorry in advance, I changed a good bit here, but I still wanted to leave my thoughts):

I changed the mashed potato layer to my go-to recipe (subs 1/2 the potatoes for cauliflower) since this recipe seemed pretty calorie-dense and we're trying to diet right now.

I also added 1/4-1/2 cup of homemade gravy since the bottom layer seemed a little dry to me. I'm not sure if it's the meatless crumbles I used or maybe I just overcooked it, but I felt like it just needed some moisture.

The directions were easy to follow. They 'really enjoy my Sheppards Pie. My favorite part of the recipe was cooking in the oven. The most challenging is making everything at the same time.

Absolutely delicious! Newly vegan and my carnivorous dad went for second helpings. I modified it slightly by adding instant mashed potatoes and I left of the cheese and cream cheese. Still turned out fabulously!

I am a newly converted vegetarian and I have my kids for the summer so i decided to make this meal. I grew up on Sheppard's Pie so why not my kids? I honestly only liked the recipe for the mashed potatoes it was new and interesting way of keeping them moist but lacked flavor emensly. It was nothing special all that prep work and it came out super bland. I honestly was better off using our family recipe and figuring out substitutions. 

Thank you but not a winner for us. I asked the kids for suggestions and I think we will use this as a base but not to the Tee. And also the instructions are confusing and weirdly numbered. We figured it out obviously. 

Also we only cooked half the recipe and refrigerated the rest. This might have helped to keep it super moist. (Its only 3 of us) lol 

Will be trying other things here on allrecipe this was my first go at the site.aquarium

This was a great meat-alternative meal that lasted my husband and me four days. I did make this vegetarian instead of vegan (milk, cheese, etc instead of vegan alternatives), used miracle whip, added an extra tomato, used a red onion instead of white, and red potatoes instead of russet. The red onion added some nice sweet undertones, and the red potatoes had good flavoring, either because of the Miracle Whip or the red potatoes. I did feel like there wasn’t a lot of flavor to the “meaty” portion, since the meat alternative didn’t really have any flavor of its own and the Italian seasonings and garlic didn’t add enough. I’ll probably tinker with it more in the future.

Excellent.  Everyone loved it.  I used a baking dish that was a bit too deep.  I would suggest a 9 by 12 baking dish would be better.

Followed the recipe step by step, the only thing that I changed was how much of the vegan 'meat' I used.  It was 2oz smaller but it didn't make a difference to me.  It was delicious and was great for Thanksgiving!  I will definitely make this again.

A truly excellent dish.  Potato topping was delicious.  The only changes/additions I made were; I added some mushrooms to the filling, simply because I had some on hand that I wanted to use up and I added a little extra seasoning as well (garlic, savoury and some BBQ sauce) to adjust to our tastes.  I also took the advice of another review and added some Danita cheese between the layer of filling and potato.  I served with a side salad and had a wonderful vegan dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

In my family we have alot of vegitarians so it was hard to feed everyone at family get togethers.  I made this and it was a huge hit.  Even the meat eaters were loving it.  Will be making it at all get togethers from now on.

This is really fantastic, we make it all of the time. I tend to change up the veggies we make it with a little bit - it doesn't seem to matter what we use. I also tend to put in more spices than are called for, but that's just personal taste. BTW, when you're making a vegan recipe, why don't you try it VEGAN? It's nice to know people's substitutions, but really, substituting meat into a vegan recipe kind of defeats the point.

Delicious! I made it vegetarian by using regular mayo and cheese.  I didn't add any cream cheese, halved the mayo, olive oil, and cheese- and it was still delicious and flavorful, and didn't feel like it was missing anything.  Will definitely make again!

This was great!!! I added a can of tomato paste and a bit of veggie broth, as some of the comments mentioned the bottom later being dry. With those additions I had no problems with that, and thought this was super delicious. I also used beyond meat crumbles, which complimented the dish perfectly.

Just made it this week. My wife says it's one of the best 10 things I ever made. Made some alterations. Added 2 tbsp worstescere  sauce to crumbled soy meat and used regular mayo. Didn't have vegan.  Otherwise as per the recipe.  We are it 4 days in a row.  It was that good.

I've never had shepherd's pie before, mainly because I thought I wouldn't like it too much. I guess I was right. The flavor was quite okay (although I had to add salt after putting it on the plate), but I didn't like the texture - it was a little too soggy on the bottom. I'm giving it 4 stars, because my boyfriend liked it, and I'm probably biased against this whole idea of a weirdly layered casserole. The potatoes were great, though!

My 7 and 11 year old along with my wife all gave this rave reviews. My 11 year old who does not like fake meat actually asked me to put more "meat" on the bottom and less mashed potatoes on top next time! I used Garden Grown Protein "The ultimate beefless ground" and it was much better than Morningstar. Made it with two changes: 1) I did not have cream cheese so I just left it out so it could stay vegan & 2) I did not use cheese.

Will def make this again!  My husband and I loved it and it was easy enough to make.  The only substitution I made was vegan sour cream in place of the vegan cream cheese, simply because that's what I had on hand, but it turned out yummy!  :)

I made this dish on 1/5/16...I must say, I was pleasantly surprised...This Shepard's pie was absolutely delicious, great flavors, and the right mixtures of ingredients.  These Combined ingredients  made this meatless comfort food a delightful substitute to the traditional meat shepherd's pie!! 
In addition, this recipe was  requested  by two colleagues. They requested and email copy; after tasting this dish during a monthly meeting at my home.  This RECIPE is a must try...I gave this recipe five earned stars!!!!

My husband and I are doing a fast from meat and dairy to recover from the holidays. :) He LOVED this recipe. I made it once and now he wants it every other day it seems. I did not have peas, but it turned out great anyway. I only used half of an onion, but I added two tablespoons of dried shallots and some leftover leeks that were diced. Great!

Soooo good. Especially the mashed potato recipe.  Pretty much made it as is but added vegan Gravy to the bottom mix. I loved it better than my meat version.

Love this! My kids are not vegan, and they thought this was made with meat! We stuffed ourselves on this dinner. I will make this again and again.
Changes...used less oil, less cream cheese substitute, added a little vegan butter spread to the potatoes. instead of Italian seasonings I used rosemary, thyme and pepper, which I added to the potatoes and to the bottom mixture.  Added Kitchen Bouquet to the bottom mixture. And used 4 cloves of minced garlic. I don't like vegan cheese, instead I sprinkled paprika on top of the potatoes for flavor. Plan to serve to my carnivore friends.

Excellent recipe.  Couple changes to cut down on fat content:  plain mashed potatoes, used firm tofu instead of meat subsitute, added fresh spinach and 1 T catsup.  Used Daiya cheddar and mozzarella mix for topping.  So tasty!!!!

Very nice!  I am a new vegan and this was a very nice recipe.  My kids and I ate it all up :)  We used lima beans instead of peas, and I added spinach because it's how I remembered shepherd's pie when I lived in France.  I used Boca crumbles-- only a half package though, and no cheese because none of us like it.  I mashed the potatoes with tofutti sour cream, dried parsley and a little bit of water, and it was awesome.  I just couldn't deal with all of the extra ingredients in the mashed potatoes but maybe I will try that sometime.  Nice recipe though, especially for a reformed meat eater.

I've made this a couple of times now and each time it's been great!   The first time I made it as directed, only used instant mashed potatoes to save time.   It was very good.    The second time I still used the instant mashed potatoes but subbed in a can of garbanzo beans for the ground beef substitute.   Also, after cooking the veggies, I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of vegetable broth to make the veggies a bit more moist.  It was FABULOUS!   This is a great recipe because you can vary the ingredients to your liking.  :D

Since I don't eat meat,I almost didn't open the "Thanksgiving" email from Allrecipes,but am I glad I did.  This recipe is so good. I would have never thought to attempt a shepards pie without meat.  I made it vegetarian,not vegan, skipped the cream cheese,because I forgot to buy it and added mushrooms,because I love them,  but the kept everything else the same. It is a great cold weather comfort food.   I also like it because you can add or change the vegetables to suit your taste or what happens to be on hand.    thanks!

I made this dish on a whim so I did not have all the ingredients on hand. I used an instant mash potato mix for the topping. For the bottom, I used onions, garlic, carrots, canned corn, canned peas, canned tomatoes, and sweet peppers. Delicious!

Excellent! My family eats this several times per month. I leave out the tomatoes and mix a packaged gravy mix (made with 1 cup of water) into the meat mixture, but other than that I prepare it according to the recipe. It is one of our absolute favorites.

I made this for our main dish on Easter!  I made it vegetarian because I am breaking my kids and husband in slowly to non meat recipes.   They loved it!  I doubled the bottom layer, used one bag of veggie crumbles and added mushrooms.  Plus I used one can of Progesso  Starters  Prtebello mushroom flavor ( I read the label and made sure there was no beef broth).  For the potatoes I added 4oz of softened goat cheese , miracle whip, and soy milk creamer.  Very, very, good!  Next time I will try making it with all vegan supplies for just me and my husband!

This was so awesome!  I didn't have any peas but I did add corn and I used half a can of tomato sauce.  I also used red potatoes and left the skin on.  It was not only delicious but also nice to look at. My neighbor and her kids were over while I was making it and they refused to leave before it was done.  By the time my husband got home there was NONE left!  Even the kids gobbled it up.  

Great and EASY dish. This is the first time I have ever given a review & I use recipes from this site all the time.  I promise, you should give it a try.

This was fantastic! My carnivorous husband said this was the best shepherds pie he has ever had.  I agree!  The mashed potatoes are great by themselves.  Finally an awesome vegan recipe for those too. THANKS A BUNCH FOR SHARING:)))))))

This was wonderful! My family isn't vegetarian so I substituted with ground beef but everything was great! And I got my kids to eat lots of vegetables! Always a plus. Thanks so much!!!

I used real dairy (except milk, I used almond milk) and did my usual don't-really-measure-anything, and it still turned out amazing. While making it, I wondered if the "meat" mixture should have some kind of gravy-ness to it, but I didn't miss it at all when eating. In fact, I rather devoured my first serving.

Very tasty!  Made it vegetarian, not vegan, with cheese and milk, but very good.

Loved this one! Shared with my omnivore friends and they thought it was phenomenal, too! Leftovers were excellent.
