Very good sweet potatoes. I used two 29oz cans of yams just drained them and mashed with the other ingredients. I made this dish the day before and refrigerated it, put the topping mixture in a ziploc bag and sprinkled over top just before baking. I did cook an additional 20 minute, but loved the time saving of getting it all ready and popping in the oven. My kids will not eat sweet potatoes but the older members of the family thought these were the best they had ever tasted.

This was amazing.  The potatoes were creamy and sweet.  It turned out better than I actually thought it would....my old recipe has been replaced.  Thanks for the post.

I really liked this recipe. I added cinnamon and allspice to it.  Next time I will use all brown sugar and more spices.  My family really enjoyed it.  They thought it was going to be for desert, so when they found out it was a sidedish, they were excited that they got to eat it with their dinner.  I served it with baked pork chops 1 from this site.

this is the best Sweet Potato Casserole ever. Been making this for a few years now. I've taken this to work pot lucks and family dinners. I always take a few copies  of the recipe with me because I'm always asked for it. One thing I've added over the years is a bit of cinnamon, and half and half or heavy cream instead of the milk. It just makes it richer. Oh and it's great cold too if you're lucky enough to have left overs ??

Outstanding on the first try!!

My only change was using fresh sweet potatoes.  For the new cooks, I wrapped 6 medium ones in foil and baked them for one hour at 350 degrees.  Then, I spooned them out and mashed them.  Proceed with remaining recipe.

My husband who doesn't eat veggies thought it was great!!  Tastes like a souffle.  Very fancy.

I have never bought canned potatoes, but I tried this and was so pleasantly surprise.  This was excellent! Lotâ€™s of taste for little effort and that's always a great thing for a busy cook.  I won't take the easy way out if the taste isn't there and this delivers in a big way, I love that it taste good no matter what temperature it is.  Thanks for a winning recipe.

I have been making this dish for years. I lost my recipe and was thrilled to find this one. It was great!! This was the only dish that had no leftovers. It's always a big hit and everyone asks me to make it when there is a dinner. I use a blender to get the mixture to the correct consistancy. This is so fast and easy to make...my three year old was able to help. I really do not like sweet potatos...but I love this. YUMMY!!!!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It is very sweet, almost like a dessert.  I am not a fan of pecans and would not mix them in next time because I like a smooth consistency to the sweet potatoes.  I did place the pecan halves in a flower shape on top and you could also place pecan halves next to each other along the edge of the dish as a border to dress it up a bit.

Fantastic recipe!  I was worried that the canned sweet potatoes would taste "canned" but they tasted just like freshly baked sweet potatoes.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was great! If you like praline pecans and creamy sweet potatoes, you'll love this recipe! Very simple to prepare and a crowd pleaser to boot. I halved the recipe and made it in a square baking dish, used chopped pecans in place of the pecan halves, and it converted well. 
I would double the topping on it in the future, but that's personal preference.

Absolutely fantastic recipe!
I served it to a bunch of college friends for dinner and it was gone before everyone arrived.  Everyone liked it so much that I ended up e-mailing the recipe to two people so far.

I made this to bring for Thanksgiving this year and it was fantastic.  Didn't change a thing and even my kids and husband who insist they HATE sweet potatos had second helpings.  Plus, since I made a double batch, I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was even better! Great recipe - thanks so much!

This was such a great recipe. My husband wanted me to make something with Yams, but I didn't know what. I always thought yams were gross, but this was absolutely amazing!! I took it over to a friend's house and everybody raved about it. Most people left it to eat with the desserts, it was so sweet and very good. I didn't have any pecans, but I used walnuts instead and that was just as good if not better. I will definitely make sure to keep this recipe for any other gatherings I have

This recipe is so great. I served it at christmas dinner and even our picky eater enjoyed it. I added a middle layer of mini marshmellows for a little something extra. I made this recipe twice, once with marshmellow and once without. The marshmellow definatly made it taste even better.

Have used this recipe several times, since I found it in 2011. I add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the sweet potatoes.  Use Splenda.   Wonderful!  It is always a hit! Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is excellent.  Personally I find it way too sweet if I put all of the sugar in.  I usually put less than half of the sugar called for in this recipe.

Excellent!  Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I didn't use pecans due to nut allergies in the family and it was still excellent.  Have already  been asked to make it for Christmas....:)

All my side dishes were a hit this Thanksgiving and all of them were from this site. This recipe was really great. Even my sister who doesn't really like sweet potatoes couldn't pass it up. The only change I made was broiling marshmellows on the top. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I don't like yams but I could eat them in this recipe.  Recipe was easy and a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Since my bunch is all use to the marshmallows on top of the yams they were really disapointed when I said I wasn't making them that way. I ended up throwing marshmallows on top the last couple minutes of cooking and they were all happy.

I don't normally love sweet potatoes but this recipe was awsome!  I came back for seconds.  The olny thing I'd change is maybe use a little less brown sugar on the topping next time because it was a little sweet.  I will make this recipe again.

Easy and awesome!  I used fresh sweet potatoes, not canned and white sugar subsitute in order to cut back on SOME of the calories.  I had three people ask me for the recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

This was an exceptional recipe!  My sister loved this recipe!  I am planning to make this for Thanksgiving except I am going to make this into a pie.  The only thing I did differently was I used real sweet potatoes instead of the canned sweet potatoes.  Also, a day or so after making this dish, try this delight on top of rolls or put inside of crescent rolls, bake and enjoy a wonderful sweet filling.

YUM!!  I made this for Thankgsiving and it was the bomb!  I am not the biggest sweet potato eater around, but this was so good I have been craving it for two weeks!  I hate pecans, and was going to leave them off, but at the last minute I pressed them into the topping and they came out yummy.  I am making this again!  Followed recipe exactly.

I decided to make this today (for Thanksgiving) since I had all the ingredients. I was really surprised how well it turned it.  Even my sister-in-law tried it and liked it.  I did leave out the pecans and added marshmallow creme.  Very good recipe-thank you!

This was a hit at Thaksgiving this year-no left overs!!  Still getting compliments!!  Easy, quick, tastes like you spent lots more time.  Will make again for Christmas.

Would recommend doubling recipe if serving more than 8 or if you want left overs.

I made this recipe last year for the holidays and it was a HUGE hit!  Of course... I am definitely making it again this year.  I do everything the exact same way, but I also add marshmellows which taste great with this.

OMG. This is so easy to prepare, and it's even easier to eat!   Is it dessert, or is it a side dish? (LOL) I added a sprinkle of cinnamon  to the topping.  Fabulous recipe, and it will be on our Thanksgiving's Day menu again and again. Thanks, Kathy.

This recipe was both easy and good! I broiled the top to give it a little extra browning and it turned out great!

These were just ok to me.  Nothing special about them.  The topping is good though.  Im still searching for a really good sweet potato recipe.
