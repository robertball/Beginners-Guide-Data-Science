The recipe was exactly how the food was described.  The ony change that I would make is to simmer the whipping cream with the chicken for less than 15-20 min if you like the dish filled with sauce. Overall great dish.

My husband LOVED this - will definitely make again. I followed the recipe other than omitting the MSG. Not too spicy but definitely had some kick! My one year old was also a fan :)

I thought it wasn't very good... I followed the directions except I used Hungarian hot paprika for the red pepper flakes since I didn't have. The chicken had flavor but it was missing something and, for me, it was bordering on salty. There was barely enough sauce and it wasn't even creamy. After it was done I ended up adding about a cup of sour cream but that really didn't help so now I'm left with this big tupperware of mess that I don't want to waste but I don't think anyone will eat it.

Taste great! Just what I was hoping for. I didnâ€™t add MSG but I wanted to add some vegetables and I happen to have spinach and yellow peppers. Turned out perfect. Definitely keeping this in my favorites.
