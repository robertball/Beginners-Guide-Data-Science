This is the exact recipe off the back of the carton of Swanson Mexican infused chicken broth. It is very good though.

I never made this version of Tortilla soup and thought to try it out on a freezing cold Chicago night since I had some leftover rotisserie chicken from yesterday. I added some basil to bring out the tomato flavors as well as some oregano, dried parsley, black pepper, and topped it off with cilantro, tortilla chips, and flaked Chihuahua cheese to melt on top of the soup. My 11 yr. old daughter couldn't get her face out of the bowl until it was empty.

I couldn’t find the broth mentioned here, so I used regular chicken broth and added fajita seasoning mix...it was delicious!

Tastes great.  Hearty soup seems perfect for after a day out in the cold.  I suggest topping with a  bit of shredded cheddar cheese too.

I couldn't find the Mexican broth, so used chicken broth and a package of chili seasoning. I made this for a fall bridal shower and everyone loved it.

I used regular chicken stock and substituted Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for the tomato paste.  Turned out great and had a nice kick to it.

Great, easy recipe. I roasted the corn in a skillet with the onions and peppers and added some diced green pepper to that mix. The slightly charred, roasted corn was a nice adder.
