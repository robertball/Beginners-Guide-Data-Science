So easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  Not too sweet - which I find a lot of Sangria.

Simply put, this was DELICIOUS!  Cool, refreshing, dare I say, somewhat healthy?  I made this in advance, stirring about every 12 hours.  I put the container in the fridge, about an hour prior to serving, and I think I should have put it on the counter.  When I ran it through the blender, it had the consistency of a smoothie, and we had to have spoons, lol!  It needed a bit more thaw time than I gave it.  I used a cup of sugar in a quadrupled recipe, and I moistened the glasses with an orange slice and rimmed the glasses with sparkling sugar.  Very festive, and everyone enjoyed this cool concoction on a very hot summer evening.  Thanks for the recipe!

This absolutely perfect! Just what your hot evening needs. I started off by refrigerating the wine, Cointreau, and orange juice before making this.

Made these last night. Didn't have orange liqueur so I added a little extra sugar. They were fabulous. Everyone loved them. Can't wait to make them again!

Subbed Grey Goose for the orange liqueur, and that worked fine. Also, used a moderately dry Cabernet Sauvignon, didn't add sugar, used frozen concentrate instead of juice... Maybe one day I'll actually make a recipe as specified, but in the meantime, this one was a good guideline to a pleasant drink.

Fun, fruity. not very sweet, use all the sugar, very seedy, you could strain it. I froze it and then it didn't pour, so had to wait a few minutes for it to thaw some.

It was a hit with my garden club members! I made minimal changes,  like using frozen mixed berries instead of ice.  I didn’t have an orange but that didn’t seem to make a difference. Putting it in the freezer made it very slushy, which was perfect. I will make this again. Such a refreshing recipe

It was very good. I used a Syrah and even then the orange flavor from the liqueur and juice almost overpowered. But still very good.

This stuff is delicious! I left out the orange liqueur because I didn't have any. The second time I made this I didn't measure, just eye-balled it, and it worked just was well. Yum!
