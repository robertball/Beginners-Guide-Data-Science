I oven roasted the squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic prior to adding it to the broth.

I've prepared many recipes from Allrecipes, but I've never felt the need to comment until now. This was a really good soup! I made it as written with the exception of the celery (we didn't have any.) I thought I might have to add cream or milk, or additional seasoning, but it was fine as is.  This will be an autumn staple for us!

This was great!! I didn’t have celery, and scaled the quantities up to feed my large (hungry) family. Roasted all veggies in oven first — diced about 3 sweet potatoes, 2 peppers (red and yellow), one onion, 5 carrots, and butternut squash. Placed all on baking sheets lined with foil, brushed with olive oil, roasted in 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes. Browned garlic in melted butter, added the roasted veggies, 1.5 boxes of vegetable stock. Simmered for about 30 mins, seasoned with a few shakes of cayenne pepper. When everything nice and tender, used a submersible wand blender to purée. WOW was this yummy!! My family dubbed it a keeper, and I agree! Was great with the cayenne kick.

I just made this recipe and wanted to say it was very good. I like a bit of spice so I added red chili flakes and a bit of fresh ginger and curry powder. Also I substituted the butter with olive oil. The soup was delightful. It was the first squash soup I have ever made and I will make it again.

I have used allrecipes for years and this is my first review.  This is a unique, flavorful and wonderful soup!  I didn't even have to use salt and pepper because the combination of vegetables were great on their own.  I made this soup with butternut because that is what I had on hand but I am sure it would be just as tasty with acorn squash as that is one of my two fave squashes.  I used two good sized bell peppers; one yellow and one red.  It is not your typical squash soup. It is more savory than sweet.  It is so good I will be bringing it to our Thanksgiving family get together.

I had never cooked with butternut squash before and this recipe made it super easy! I used a yam instead of a sweet potatoe and I added a package of firm tofu before I blended the soup for a little added protein,  I also added a little nutmeg.  This soup will become a regular fall meal for us for sure,

Amazing, I skipped the blender and left it chunky. So delicious and satisfying. Taste the natural sweetness of the veggies. I even ate it at room temp. Delicious.

Made this from leftover roasted sweet potatoes and squash (from Thanksgiving) using turkey stock.  It is spectacular.  Following the advice of several commenters, I added ginger, turmeric and curry powder.  I also added a splash of dry sherry.  It’s great!

This was amazing. I admit that I had doubts but this was super creamy (without the cream) and super sweet. I roasted the squash and sweet potatoes and steamed the carrots (I should have roasted them too). Going back for seconds ...

I have made this soup four times! I do not change a thing. It is sweet, thick and nutritious. This is the best butternut squash soup I have eaten and I’ve had many!  I eat a bowl with some bread and it’s very filling. That’s all I need for a quick lunch or dinner.  Sometimes I double the recipe and freeze half. I take out a bowl the night before and let it defrost. Be aware that thawing in the refrigerator takes quite along time.  Pop it into the microwave for a quick eat and serve.  Love this!

This soup is amazing. It’s fun to make with the kids and it’s delicious. I roasted the vegetables in the butter for longer than indicated and tried to get many of them brown before moving on to the next step.

This soup came out very well. It was tasty, but personally I found the taste of three peppers overwhelmed everything else. Next time I will only use one.

This was surprisingly easy to prepare and delicious. Delicious soup. It is smooth and hearty. No need for cream, it's already velvety. I didn't have carrots or celery so I just added more sweet peppers and celery seed, coriander and ginger. 

It was an awesome side for brats for a nice cozy dinner at home. You could add smoked sausage to it for a heartier soup meal for the guys like mine who want meat with dinner. Mine likes it on the side, so I used fresh sausages and grilled them.

I oven-roasted all the vegetables, and otherwise made it exactly as directed.  It was wonderful, and made a large amount.  Something about the sweet peppers gives it a unique flavor.

Just made, very easy and my family loves it, including my 19 year old picky eater!  The only thing I did different was throw in an extra carrot and I also used green peppers but only 2.  I also added some nutmeg, ginger and a dash of smoked paprika to salute my Hungarian Mother in Law.   Make sure you let it cool before you throw it in the nutri-bullet!!

Great soup! I cooked the initial vegetables in olive oil instead of butter this time because we have a dairy free lunch guest, and I added a touch of Chipotle Chili Powder (probably between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon) to give it a little light heat. Great way to change the dish up and make it a little more flavorful! Definitely doesn't need cream or anything like that because the texture is great on its own. Definitely going to make it again.

This is so good! I did make a few changes to use what I had on hand. I had bacon fat in the fridge so I used that instead of butter. I did not have quite enough butternut squash, so in went an extra carrot. Finally, I added a scant tablespoon of cumin just for the fun of it. I will certainly make this soup again.

I have to say this is one of the most favourful soups I have made.  I did add a little curry (1 tsp.) and 1/2 tsp. of ginger because I like a little bit of spice. It was very thick so I added just a 1/2 a cup of coconut milk and it was a lovely consistancy and taste.  I will definitely making this soup on a regular bases.

Very good!  Roasted the butternut, sweet potatoes and sweet peppers (one yellow/one red). Sautéed the onion, celery and garlic in butter then added everything. Added just a bit of salt.   Probably would use less butter next time.   Lovely combo of flavors.   Will make again.

I have been making this type of soup for 2 years. I found that baking the squash and sweet potatoes, then cooling them is the best way to peel them. My additions are 2 Tbsp Cinnamon, 1 Tbsp Nutmeg, 1 cup applesauce. I saute 1 chopped medium onion,  1 clove garlic, celery and 2 cups grated carrots. I doubled the squash. I blend all with a hand immersion blender. Excellent results!

Terrific flavor!  A different twist that the whole family enjoyed with the inclusion of fresh peppers.  Served with a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds.  YUM!

I put together this recipe with a few others to match the ingred I had at home.  I wish one of the recipes had mentioned how hard it is to cut and peel the butternut squash.  I ended up microwaving it to soften it up.  10 min for parts of it!  It definitely made things much easier.

Wonderful soup! I used some coconut oil along with the butter, dried onion rather than fresh, and only one cloves of garlic.  Perfect medicine for the cold bones I have from outdoor activities today!

We loved it but we ended up adding to it a bit. We added extra carrots, celery, sweet peppers and garlic. We also put Rosemary, Basil, Thyme, Nutmeg and Turmeric in it. With all the additions my family loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

I made this soup very close to the recipe except I left out the celery and added some fresh ginger. I also roasted my vegetables first after reading another review. I really love the roasted taste. It was really delicious! I will be making it again for sure!

Great soup! Sweet and smooth. Added an extra carrot and an extra celery stick. Could use a bit more flavour/spice. Lots of cracked pepper is great to keep it simple, or some cayenne as well. A bit of ginger might also be a nice addition, I'll try that next time.

Only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (to taste) this really kicks up the flavor of this soup. I like this soup better than the more popular butternut squash soup as it doesn't have cream cheese.

Amazing hearty soup that is so creamy minus the cream.  I like roasting the veggies in the oven instead of cooking on the stove top.  I am making it again tonight.

I would definitely make this again, but would omit the celery. I'm not a fan of celery. The texture was wonderful. Smooth and not too thick  without adding cream or milk. I didn't change anything and followed the directions exactly. I do think it needs a little zing...it's a bit on the bland side...and, again, I think the celery overpowered the other flavors. Besides omitting the celery next time, I might add a little cheyenne pepper. Very good recipe.

This was good, but we have had better soups.  I made it as it said, but it was a bit sweet for our taste buds.  It wasn't  terrible mind you just not what we were looking for.

I used veg stock instead of chicken and yellow, red, and green peppers.  Taste excellent.

This was too thick for my taste so I thinned it with coconut milk. I also added minced ginger and half a minced jalapeño to the vegetables when I roasted them. Added a little curry  powder to the seasonings. Basicly though, a good and healthy recipe.

I made his recipe for my soup group at school and my colleagues LOVED it!  I was amazed at how hearty and creamy it seems without any dairy in it!  I made it the second time without using any butter (to make it even healthier) and it was just as delicious.

It was a nice twist on the classic butternut squash soup.
