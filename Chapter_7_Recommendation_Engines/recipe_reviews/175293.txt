Very delicate & delicious! It is very FANCY sugar cookie. I had made these for a childrens fundraiser and they sold out!   Another helpful hint, USE Parchment paper! lift off perfectly and with great ease! This is essential since you must work quickly to lift off pan and then roll before they cool.

This is a technically difficult cookie to make.  You need sides on your cookie sheet to contain spillovers. The dough liquified into a huge pancake the first time, and cooked unevenly the second.  It is hard to get the softer parts to roll up like the browned edges do so well.  I liked the flavor but need help with the execution of the wafers.

I was looking for ice cream cone recipe, but I stumbled into this. This reminds me of my childhood, my mother used to buy barquillo after coming out from the church. This barquillo taste better than the one I buy from the store, it is light and melts in your mouth. I even stuffed it with whipped cream. Since it is delicate, I only put 6 in the tray, so that I do not have to rush rolling it. After baking I place it on a cloth napkin where I will roll it and used the napkin to help me to roll. I put it on the kitchen towel with the overlapped edge down, just in case it unrolls. I baked it on silpat liner. The only problem I have was spreading it on the tray with my offset spatula. I will use this recipe again

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out AMAZING! The hardest part for me though was rolling them before they turned crisp. I ended up taking them out as soon as the edges turned color. I also used pandan extract instead of vanilla. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I just made these and they came out very good! I think I didn't make them thin enough when I spread the batter out, but they still tasted delicious, definitely going to be trying them again :)

I love this recipe. BUT the very best way to make this is to add an extra teaspoon of vanilla whip the butter, egg whites and sugar together before gently mixing in the flour. Makes them nice and fluffy without adding any rising ingredients and you have more time when they come out of the oven to smear some chocolate in them before you roll them up

I took one's advice to bake 6 at a time, allowing me sufficient time to roll the cookies as they came off the sheet. With each batch, my technique improved. I used a small cookie scoop, spreading with the back of a spoon (aiming to spread evenly), and rolled around a plastic chopstick. Fun and tasty (appreciatively not too sweet)!

It was awesome but I suggest to make it cookie style! If you don't have parchment paper you can make it cookie style and use wax paper instead of a cookie sheet or parchment paper.

I bake a lot and these were an epic FAIL.  Not sure if you were supposed to "fluff" the batter (which I didn't because the instructions didn't indicate to do that).  I'm not sure how anyone is able to "spread thinly" - the dough was just slightly softer than cookie dough, and for as thin as you needed to make them (probably 1/16") it needed to be much thinner, more like pancake batter.  Very disappointed in this recipe because I so many ideas for what to do with them!  I hope there's another one I can use!

Easy cookie to make but too difficult to roll up. It turned out thicker and more cakey than barquillos I've had in the past, which made the "rolling" turned into "folding" which didn't work. I quickly abandoned that effort and served the cookies flat. Got great reviews on the taste from all my guests.

I had a problem with the batter, I couldn't spread it thin enough, so it was like a thin cake.  Tasty, I'll have to give this another try
