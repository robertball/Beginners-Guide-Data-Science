This was an interesting salad - refreshing on a hot day. First, I must admit that I substituted toasted slivered almonds for the pinenuts. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. This would make a better side dish than main dish (as we had it). We found the salad very acidic overall, so I may try reducing the vinegar next time.
