This was a delicious recipe.  I followed the directions with the addition of the tomato puree. Like someone else mentioned, it does make quite a bit, but tastes even better when the flavors have had a chance to meld. I served it over farfalle pasta. To sop up the juices, I completed the meal with  crusty multigrain rolls. My husband said it was one of best meals I've made Ina long time.

Made this for dinner and it was wonderful! A few hints that might be helpful: this makes A LOT!  I cut the recipe in half and it still required me to use my large (14”) iron skillet to fit everything and there was still  plenty. The cooking times I thought were a little long. You should simmer 15-20 min covered and then remove lid and simmer about 15 min more. I used the optional tomato pureé. Also the ingredient list includes fresh tomatoes but they are not included in the directions. Just toss them in with the eggplant and zucchini. Make sure to use Herbs de Provence! It’s what makes it taste so good! I sprinkled with Parmesan cheese to guild the Lilly!

Thanks for confirmation this can be done "authentically" in a pot, rather than baked.  What a relief.  I always improvise but the ingredients and prep here are a good basis for that.  Personally prefer ground Romano or Asiago with black pepper to top.

This is an amazing recipe for a next day meal.  I like it best when the spices have a chance to really penetrate into the dish.  Wonderful over green rice (made with basil to make it green).

So very close as to i have been making this for many years.

I have made this once before and I enjoyed it very much.
I made it again and it is very good. The flavors work well together. I started this in the stove and put it in the oven to finish. I had it in at 250 degrees for about 3 hours, made it nice and thick. I like this over my eggs and it is good  over steamed rice. 
Thank you for the recipe.
June 25/2019.

Very good flavour and easy to prepare. Fresh local summer vegetables make all the difference! Made as written except I didn’t add tomato purée. I did add a summer squash I had no other plans for. I also added a can of drained chickpeas for a little protein. But it would have been equally delicious without my additions. The eggplant is what really sets this dish apart. Yummy & thumbs up from this family!
