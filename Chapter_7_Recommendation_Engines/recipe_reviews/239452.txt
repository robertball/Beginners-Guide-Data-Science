I made these for my 7th grade Teen Living class and they LOVED them.  They demanded for me to put them on my school website for access to make some at home.

Really great flavor! I brought these into work this morning and I had 2 people asking for the recipe, and the bars disappeared within an hour.  I didn't have any trouble with the bars falling apart. Here is what I did. I lined my pan with foil. When they came out of the oven, I let sit for about 5 minutes, then lifted them out of the pan using the foil. I sliced the bars immediately, and gently pressed down, and pressed the sides in so that they were compacted. I let cool, then placed them in a container, uncovered overnight. This morning they had a dense muffin texture and weren't crumbling.  I do have to say they definitely DO NOT look like the Mott's/allrecipes photo. They don't have a granola bar texture at all. They are moist and dense.  For the dried fruit, I used a mix called New England Crunch, made by Mariani. It is a mix of cranberries, almonds and dried cinnamon apple bits.  This recipe can easily be scaled down for 12 servings by using an 8 x 8" pan. For the egg, just mix the 1 egg with a fork, measure it, and use half.

Delicious and nutritious! I saw the photo yesterday in the photo voting and I had all the ingredients and made it right away. I took the other reviewer's advice and made half the recipe. Now I'm thinking I should have made a full recipe!  The bars made the whole house smell good! The kids loved these as a snack and hubby brought some to work today. No crumbling issues that a couple people mentioned.

We did not care for this.  It was bland and the bars were cake like and crumbled very easily.  They did not hold together.  I would not make this again.

These bars are delicious and easy to make.  I used Craisins for the dried fruit bits.  I really liked the addition of coconut.  I thought they were similar to baked oatmeal.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  I will surely make these again.

The flavor of these is good and somewhat reminded me of a baked oatmeal recipe I've made in the past.  I appreciate that they are a healthy, nutritious alternative for breakfast and snacks.  The consistency was a little more cake like than I had anticipated, but still, overall, a nice recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Mott's!

This recipe had great flavor and my husband in particular was a big fan.   I used a mixture of dried cranberries and raisins as my dried fruit.   I am not sure what the texture of the bars are supposed to be, but, I was anticipating it to be more of chewy granola bar from the picture Allrecipes posted.  The texture of my bars was very soft and more like a really soft cookie or cake.  I cooked for 23 minutes until golden brown on top and let it cool in the pan completely.    Personally, I would much prefer the texture of a granola bar and not the cake like texture.  The flavor is a four-five, but, the texture is a four for my family. 11/3/14 I have to amend my recipe from yesterday.  I covered the bars with plastic wrap overnight and after sitting a day they will not stay together.  Once you cut - it is very difficult to pick them up without them falling apart. I don't think I would make these again.

These reminded me of oatmeal squares more than a crunchy texture. (Which was what it looked like in the photo.) I even cut the applesauce by half and didn't get even a little bit crunchy. 
I THINK this would be a crunchier texture if I used regular, instead of quick cooking, oats. Toddler wasn't impressed, husband loved them, I was just okay with them. Overall, not the biggest hit in our family.

I used blueberry applesauce and it gave it a wonderful flavor. I also used old fashioned oat and added a touch of maple syrup. Next time I am going to add some chopped nuts. Another recipe I can play with. The amount of cinnamon sounded like to little so I added about a tablespoon and a dash of nutmeg.

They were pretty easy to make but I wasn't in love with the taste. It was a bit bland for me. I would use this recipe as a base but add my own touch to it next time to fit my personal taste

These are delicious! I'm impressed with how tasty they are and of the consistency. They will be great for horseback riding and to take to work. Thanks!
