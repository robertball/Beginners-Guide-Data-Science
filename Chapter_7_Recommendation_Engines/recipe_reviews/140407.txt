I made this recipe as written (though multiplied by 1.5) and took to a family gathering of 25 people.  They were snatched up faster than any of the standard favorites I brought as well!  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!  Definitely will make these again!

Great recipe.  Gave this traditional dish just the right amount of "something different" without going over board!  Took them to a pot-luck and they flew off the plate fastere than anything else.  I was lucky to sample one myself! Thanks!  Will make again!

These turned out really well, I made them to take to a Christmas lunch and got rave reviews on them! The only thing different I did was to use green onion in place of the chives and I didn't have any mayo so used fat free miracle whip, also the sour cream I used was fat free so that helped out also. I will make them again and one woman who is known to not ever do any cooking actually asked me for the recpie!!!

These deviled eggs have gotten me more compliments than any other appetizer I have made!  I do use bacon instead of the prosciutto and green onions instead of the chives but they are still wonderful.  Be prepared to be asked for the recipe!

These were ok, but not our favorite. I don't know what it was...maybe too many different things/flavors going on or something. Thanks anyway for sharing. :)

A neighbor brought these to a gathering and they were a terrific hit. Everyone absolutely loved them - even our typical picky eaters. She didn't have any difficulty making them. I'm grabbing this recipe so I'll be ready for the next occasion to take an appetizer.

Different from the usual.  Made them as directed.  Seemed to be missing something,  not sure what
