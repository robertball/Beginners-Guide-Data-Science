I have made this dip many times and it is always a winner. I chop the onions instead of slicing and they cook just fine. No crunchies. Also, if you use reduced fat mayo, it cuts down on the grease nicely.

Delish! I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan, and I caramelized the onions first. Also you really have to drain the oil off otherwise it will be too greasy.

I must say that it was lot better than I thought it would be. My friends loved i. made few changes. I diced onions, I used pepper jack cheese and used half mayo half sour cream. and some grated garlic. it turned out to be the bomb, on girl friend want me to make on saturday just to have keeper. don't get  me wrong it was very good the way it was. I being a chef always have to personalize everything. sorry.

Your recipe inspired me to make a bite sized treat. I added chopped vidalia onion to thawed frozen creamed spinach, added it to phyllo cups and stacked with swiss, asiago,and parmesan. Baked for 5 mins. Delish!!!

This Dip is excellent!!  The only change I made is, I sauteed the onions before making it, I did not want to have the crunch of the onion.  I put it out at a work function, was gone in less than an hour!

I have to admit, I could not use Vidalia for this recipe as winter is the completely wrong time to be able to find them. However, I did use yellow onions that I sauteed just a bit first to bring out their sweetness and then proceeded with the recipe as stated. Love this stuff - wayyyy too addicting and I could have eaten the whole thing myself. Next time I may follow another reviewer's suggestion and use lower fat mayo to cut down on the oiliness a bit, but it may have been due to a tad bit of overbaking as well. Still, wonderful, wonderful stuff. Thanks Jenn!

I sliced the onions and then cut them into quarters.  I can see topping slices of toasted baguette with this as well as spreading on crackers.  Really good and easy recipe with nice presentation.

I always get requests for this recipe wherever I bring it!  Delicious, highly addictive, the only change I make is I use light mayonnaise, as I find regular mayo is too greasy.

This was seriously one of the best dip recipes I've tried.  Aside from using light mayo I followed the recipe exactly and used a peeler to slice the onions thinly per other reviewers' suggestions.  This was slightly time consuming but the end result was worth the effort.  Served this with crackers on Christmas Eve and everyone ate it up.

A gal at work brought this dip in; it was so wonderful that I'm making some to bring to my brothers house today for Super Bowl Sunday!  It is a very yummy dip, but you have to really like onions and cheese.

I made this for a few parties and it was always a big hit. Very easy and delicious.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it tends to be on the greasy side, even though I used reduced fat products.

SOOO good. Made this the other night and we liked it so much i'm making it again tonight. Used light mayo - otherwise followed recipe exactly and was great. If you like spicy, I definitely recommend adding a good amount of hot sauce. Yum!

Loved the flavor of this dip, but I had a real problem with the amount of grease in the finished product even thought I followed the recipe to hat said, if I made it again I would try other reviewers suggegstions to decrease the amount of grease.

Absolutely loved the recipe.  Made this for a Christmas Day appetizer and EVERYONE loved it -- from ages 15 to 85.  Sweet, creamy  and delicious.  Enlisted the help of my food processor to slice the onions.  Used reduced fat mayonnaise, freshly grated gruyere and parmesan cheeses.  Served with Carr's crackers, Sociables and Triscuits.  Did not utilize any hot sauce with the initial try but might incorporate the next time I make the recipe.

Delish. I think the suggestions to use low fat ingredients are wise; this is very oily. Next time, I may chop the onions rather than thinly slicing (I used a mandolin, so it was easy, but I think I'd like the texture of the chopped better). Also, it's a little bland, so the hot sauce helps a lot; I'd like to think of an additional vegetable to use, but not sure what would be a complementary flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding diced garlic.  It was a huge hit at our family get-together and there was none left.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not think it was too greasy using all mayo as opposed to half sour cream and half mayo.  Absolutely great!

Followed exactly save for a couple of things: I sauteed the onions first to eliminate some crunch, and used mild cheddar instead of swiss and parmesan. Awesome party dip!

I do like this recipe as is. But to make it simple and easy to remember over the years I have changed it to three equal parts Swiss cheese, mayonnaise, and onion. And a big pinch or two of garlic powder. That makes it easy for me to make it for any size I need.

I doubled the amount of Parmesan and used half mayo/half whole milk plain Greek yogurt which gave it a little tanginess that complimented the sweet onion. If you can’t get Vidalias, a regular onion would also work, but you’ll cry a lot more while slicing them.

Delicious!!   The only change I made was using a little bit of sour cream in lieu of the mayo..  However, I’m a fan of mayo, so I only did it a quarter substitute ;) Will definitely make again..  btw, loved the hot sauce- wasn’t sure about that, but glad I stuck to recipe!!

Very easy prep which is wonderful.  

I should have put a bit more hot sauce in.  I used 1/4 ts due to my husband's taste buds.  When a recipe calls for  something "to taste,"  it can be hard to judge if you are making it the first time.

I am giving the recipe four stars, because the end result is very watery.  I will make it again with already sauteed Vidalia onions and see if that helps.

I made this for Christmas morning, and it was a hit! Using brioche bread (the only change I made to the recipe), it was easy to put together the night before.  I popped it in the oven the next morning right before we started opening presents, and it was ready when we finished. Very easy and delicious!

This dip is awesome! The only changes I made was instead of baking the dip I put it in a small crockpot! This dip was the first one gone at my party!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I made this at the last minute for a dinner party.  Many compliments on how good it was.  Made as directed excepted I chopped the onions and pre-cooked them as others did.  Will definitely make this again.

This was yummy. The Vidalia onions made it the right amount of sweetness.
