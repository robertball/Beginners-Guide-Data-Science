First time making these chocolate mint cookies they are very good but I improvised on recipe a little the door was quite soft so I added more flour and I needed to bake the cookies longer than nine minutes I would say 12 minutes I would make them again.

I brought these to a dessert potluck and everyone loved them. I added more peppermint extract for a bit of a kick, but I think even without that there's a definite peppermint aftertaste . I wish it were less of an aftertaste and more of an up-front taste, but I'm not sure how to correct for that.
