The citrus ginger flavor was very good and the steak turned out great.  Flat iron steak is my favorite.

My husband really enjoyed this. I used Sriracha sauce and also subbed dry ginger for the root; however, I think the fresh would have been even better.  We served it with black beans and steamed veggies.

I used a flank steak and only had it marinate for an hour.  It was delicious.  The flavors were very subtle and not over powering. I'll make it again.
