this was great.  I didn't really trust that it would turn out but it did. The only advice I have is to watch the pepper because the garlic can also have a peppery tast and it was a little strong.  But I will make this agian it is better than frying it or putting sause all over the eggplant.  I did call my mother in law and she was going to try it.

It is a delicous side dish or snack.  I did use olive oil and dried herbs, didn't detract from the taste.  I would suggest peeling the eggplant skins though.

Pretty good.  I peeled the skin off and put oil on the slices before putting them in the oven.  They came out a little tender around the edges, however, with some sauce and/or cheese, it's really good.  I may possibly use this recipe again in the future as a oven-baked version of eggplant parm versus frying the slices.

These were really good!  I was surprised at how such a simple concept could taste so yummy.  It was a great way to use herbs from the garden.  We served with a couscous cooked in veggie broth with pine nuts and parsley, and all mixed together it was delicious.

This was a good basic recipe, but nothing special.  Might be good with some kind of dipping sauce to go with it.

I used dried herbs and roasted a pint of cherry tomatoes along with the eggplant in the second 7 minutes. Delicious!

I would make this again but I only had dried herbs so I did add olive oil to it to spead it on.  Next time I think I will try grilling the eggplant instead of putting it in the broiler.

Delicious and simple, and quick to boot! My husband LOVED this recipe, and we were delighted to have dinner made almost entirely from the bounty of our garden.

Garden Fresh!  It was enjoyable to cook from my garden.  The amount of herbs called for was more than needed.  The eggplant was looking dried out rather than crispy so I brushed with a little oil and baked a little longer.  The end result was better than I expected.  It made flavorful baked eggplant slices.   Thank you NIBLETS for sharing your recipe!

Healthy and good!  I added some olive oil to combat the dryness and for added flavor.  Also good on the grill wrapped in aluminum foil.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It is a great side dish at dinner.  If you dont like garlic stay clear of this one.  However, the Garlic and pepper give this recipe most of its flavor so don't hold back on them.

This recipe was literally not edible.  We are sorry that we wasted an eggplant from our garden to make this recipe.  Don't waste your time or an eggplant on this recipe.

We didn't care for this. Followed directions. Ended up adding parmesan cheese then it became too salty. Finally topped with some canned diced tomatoes (Italian seasoning) to make it edible.

I'm not a big veggie lover, but this was yummy. I added a little more garlic and herbs to it and some parmesan cheese.

I cut the eggplant into 1" square pieces and pan fried it with a little olive oil.  I put the herbs on the eggplant with enough oil to make the herbs stick.  Came out great and didn't take very long to cook.

Very good. The eggplant didn't need to be salted first, it wasn't bitter). I used dried herbs/spices (didn't measure) in which I added olive oil to soften, it seems to make a lot of mix but doesn't taste overpowering.  The eggplant  was peeled into stripes. Cherry tomatoes and feta or mozzarella  were added for more flavor and now made a better presentation when all served on greens. I didn't broil it because I was too afraid it would burn  Served with olives, rice and chicken strips made  enough for a light dinner/lunch.

I thought this was extremely good. I added a little extra seasoning. The next time I make it, I'm going to go lighter on the pepper. Other than that, it was really tasty!

Served this as a side to mahi mahi.  Was surprised that it was tender and not dried out.  I thought about brushing with olive oil but didn't need it. Very tasty and easy!

This is a great recipe, and so healthy! When I make this again I'll make a little more herb seasoning, I ran out slightly. I also added some parmesan cheese.

I loved this and will definitely cook eggplant like this again, but next time I will be wary of "generously" salting the eggplants--mine turned out too salty.

Ok, I did not think this would be nearly as good as it was. I only used oregano and salt, and sprayed the eggplant with cooking spray. I also skipped the broiling phase because I didn't want to get another pan dirty. This was crazy delicious. I wish I had another eggplant so I could make some more right now!

This is absolutely delicious!  My only changes: I added in some fresh rosemary because I was trying to find uses for it, and I think I doubled the oregano because I love oregano.  This isn't a fat covered eggplant recipe, so it shouldn't be compared to one.  This is an incredibly healthy, delicious recipe and I really don't see how adding fat could even make it taste better.  My five-year old (who isn't picky, but a kid nonetheless) gobbled it up and asked for more.  I will be sharing this recipe with family and friends.
