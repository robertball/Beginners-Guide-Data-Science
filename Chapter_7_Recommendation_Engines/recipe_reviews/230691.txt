Like the flavors, like that it is a cold salad, so it is good to take to get-togethers.  Worked well with reduced fat feta cheese, and does not need, in my opinion, so much olive oil -- so then it ends up healthier.

Simple, light and very good.  I could eat a pile of this.  I will make it again with a bit of lemon or vinegar, but it is recommended to make as is first.  This would be very good wrapped in a pita or served with pita chips.

This recipe is very good and fresh.  I did use fresh Dill instead of the dried as called for in the recipe.  I'll make this again.

I made this with a 16 oz can of black lentils that I rinsed & drained. Didn't have yellow bells, so subst. red bell peppers. Instead of dill, I added 1/4 t. garlic powder and the juice of 1/2 lemon. It is very tasty!

I served this with Pineapple Grilled Pork Chops and it was a lovely favor combination. I wouldn't call it "creamy", but I used Gorgonzola instead of Feta, and it probably would have been better if I had added it when the lentils were still warm. The recipe should specify. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I were allowed to use cilantro. When it comes to cilantro, there's a deep divide in our home between the pro and anti-cilantro factions. Herbs, especially controversial ones like cilantro, should be a matter of discussion and deep contemplation before marriage. I was so head-over-heels in love with my fianc√©, I chose be blissfully ignorant of his deep-seated aversion to cilantro, and now I am paying the consequences.

Yum! Who would have thought that dill would pair so well with lentils? I like to use the steamed lentils sold in a vacuum packed box in the refrigerated goods of the produce section in the market. They're cooked perfectly, never mushy or gritty. Since they already have some salt in them I only added about 1/3 of a teaspoon. Also, I added less olive oil and a bit more feta. I'm serving this salad with fresh baked bread tonight. Thanks, Mcress!
