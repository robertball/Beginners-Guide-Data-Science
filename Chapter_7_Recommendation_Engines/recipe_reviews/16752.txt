Takes more than 15 minutes to prepare but it is yummy! You can use the leftover dip for salad dressing.

This recipe would be enough to serve 20 people or more!! I made 1/4 of this amount and it was plenty for 4 people. It is delicious. I used precooked bacon and just guessed on the amount and you want to make sure the bacon is finely chopped in a food processor. I used a few shakes of onion powder instead of fresh onion. I will make this again!!

Made this for a salad dressing only and it was excellent! I used red onion for the onion and I just can't say enough about this. Excellent! It looks too thick but it is not. Thanks for sharing!
