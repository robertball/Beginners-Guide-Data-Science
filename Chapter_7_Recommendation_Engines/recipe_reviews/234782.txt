I used steamed fresh broccoli. But more importantly I used one 98% fat free mushroom soup, and one cream of broccoli soup. my mayo is Hellmann's with olive oil. I only used half the cheese, all in my attempt to make this a little healthier. I was disappointed at first, because it was very soupy, and incredibly hot! letting it sit for 20 minutes is better after taking it out of the oven. then it set, and had a wonderful flavor. will make it again, will make a great pot luck dish!

Good basic starter recipe. I used leftover real mashed potatoes, used green beans because I didn't have broccoli, and I cut the recipe in half. Very, very good. I think any veggie can work...my next pick of a veggie will be corn. Family loved it.

Used a can cream of celery and a can cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup.  Also didn't thaw out broccoli, was still cooked perfectly.
