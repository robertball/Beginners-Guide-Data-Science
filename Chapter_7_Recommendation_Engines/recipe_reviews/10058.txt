I really, really liked this recipe!  Quick and extremely easy to make, and with a really good tasting, not-too-sweet cookie as your end result.  I particularly liked the fact that, though the recipe calls for real butter, you didn't have to refrigerate the dough before baking.  I adapted the recipe to a half batch with no problems.  The only thing I found I had to do differently was modify the baking time a bit:  I cooked them for about 11 minutes on a parchment paper-lined sheet, and they turned out beautifully.  My entire family loved these cookies, and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks so much, Arlene! :)

These are surprisingly good - nice and crunchy!  I added 1 t of vanilla.  Don't let the potato chips put you off.

Unlike others, my cookies did not spread when baking. They were perfect and like most cookies, though I only bake with butter. (sometimes overbeating/creaming has caused my cookies to spread). I did substitute toffee chips (with the chocolate on them) for the butterscotch chips.  They came out great, and the hint of chocolate was great. Also, they didn't seem to be as sweet as when I used the butterscotch chips.

Very easy to make and tastes great. Excellent way to get rid of the "crumbs" in the bottom of the bag. I put white choclate instead of butterscotch one time and that was good too! Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were interesting. Quick and easy to make but I don't think I'd make them again with the butterscotch chips. The butterscotch is a little too sweet so it overwhelms the salty taste. Maybe something like semisweet chocolate chips would make it better!

This cookie is a hit every where I go. People are stunned there are potato chips in them. I add a 3rd egg each time I make it then they turn out perfect.

I thought these were very good.  I saw an identical recipe somewhere else that called for 2 cups of flour, not 2.5, but I added the extra and thought that the dough was rather dry, but it still came together nicely.  My cookies did not bake up flat or spread - they were perfectly shaped.  I did add a bit of vanilla.  I liked them - unfortunately, my family did not.  They did not care for the flavor of butterscotch (wuzzies!) so next time I'll use chocolate chip.  I might add some peanuts too.. these would have been great using them.  Thanks for sharing, Arlene

These were good...but honestly...the potato chips did not add anything but calories. Very moist and chewy but I probably won't make these again.

This is one of the few items I bake well. They have been a staple in my holiday baked goods for years. Use thin potato chips such as Lays Original. Add a 1/2 cup of pecans to the recipe as well. I always chill my dough for 30 minutes before I bake them. I have found that men and boys absolutely love these cookies.

My kids love these. Even my husband said "These are awesome." He couldn't believe I used up all those mostly empty bags of stale chip crumbs in the bottom of the pantry-I was trying to be frugal! I made them in the food processor and just folded in the butterscotch chips at the end. I made half the batch without the chips and mixed them in with the last half. Very easy and very good! Thanks...

I'm a cookie novice and intermediate in terms of cooking food that I need in order to survive obviously. This sounds like an easy recipe but it isn't because the cookies spread out a little too much. They do taste wonderful and I love the sweet/salty combination between the butterscotch chips and the crushed potato chips. My husband loves these and asked for more some other time. I think what I'll do in the future is half the recipe per someone's suggestion on this board along with using parchment paper which was another suggestion offered as well. All in all I do like these cookies but they need to be tweaked just a little bit and I'll call my Mom to see what she suggests. If you do want a lot of cookies fast it is definitely a little cookie that makes a lot fairly quickly;)! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I didn't have enough potato chips so used 1 cup potato chips and 1 cup taco chips. Worked great. Good recipe and great way to finish off those bags of chips no one wants to finish.

I wanted a cookie that was a little different and this sure did it. I liked the sweet butterscotch mingling with the salty potato chips. My only change if I made them again would be to substitute shortening for half the butter as my spread a little too much. But they taste delicious.

Just made these. fabulous! Who would have thought butterscotch & potato chips would blend so well!? At first glance they look like white chocolate chip cookies. I followed the directions exactly and the dough was very easy to handle. It held it's form and I was able to space the cookies close together on the sheet and didn't have any of them melting together.The cookies turned out round and thick. Very moist and full looking. Mine didn't look like the picture... A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I made a half batch of these which yielded 25 cookies using my cookie scoop. I was disappointed that these cookies for me anyway came out incredibly flat and they crack and crumbled apart easily. But I loved the flavor so I may try again.

These are tasty! I added 1 tsp of vanilla extra and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I wish I doubled the crushed chips because I wanted them to come through more but overall really good!

I woke up yesterday morning remembering a potato chip cookie that my mom last made probably 30 years ago. I did an ingredient search and couldn't believe a recipe was posted. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly -- just the way I remembered them. I took them to our family reunion and they were a huge hit -- at least two of my cousins asked for the recipe! These were a great hit and my daughter told me I should quick working and just bake these every day. Thanks for posting!

Pretty good cookies. Interesting. I used sweet potato chips since I don't have potato chips. Bf said he couldn't really taste the chips which is good. They certainly offset the sweetness of the butterscotch chips which made me happy. A little chewy and flat cookies. They look puffy when you take them out but if you leave them on the cookie sheet for 3-4 minutes they flatten right up. thanks for the recipe!

One of my friends made these for me growing up and I really liked the salt and sweet combination. I used half shortening and butter and also added pecans. You can add less butterscotch morsels to your liking and replace with nuts.

Even though they sound bizarre they are very tasty. I did these for a project and my teacher thought it was very cool. I wouldn't cook them for as long though just keep a close eye on them:)

Just whipped these up for the first time and I'd have to say they were some of the easiest to make yet most delicious cookies I've ever made. Hardest part was staying out of the dough until they were done. Just the right sweetness and a nice chewy texture. Excellent

I found this recipe not long after discovering there was even such a thing as a potato chip cookie. The first recipe I tried didn't quite have the balance I was looking for and I thought the butterscotch chip was a great addition. Knowing how overly sweet these chips can be I did cut back on the sugars by 1/4 cup each and only used 1 cup of chips. We preferred the addition of the butterscotch flavor over the plain version.

Great cookie! I really hate when people totally change a recipe and then give it a 4 or 5 rating. In my opinion a recipe should be rated on how good it is based on how it was written; but having said that I have made these cookies six times and I have used a few variations. The first few times I made them as written and then I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch & added some pecans I made a batch for my family then 2 batches for work and they were all snapped up within a few minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

These were surprisingly yummy and crunchy. In retrospect I would have decreased the butter by 1/4 cup since the chip crumbs were oily and made the cookies come out flatter than I like. Added 2 tsp of vanilla and chocolate chips to the second half of the batch after baking 2 trays.

My cookies turned out thin and crispy and the dough melted and spread out in the oven while the butterscotch chips stayed mostly in the center. They aren't so much sweet/salty although they have a good sweet flavor (I love the butterscotch). My kids couldn't get enough of them! I agree with another reviewer and think I might like them better if they didn't spread so much during cooking.

Very good. Thought it would be more salty/sweet but really was more sweet. I will make these again but may add more potato chips. Very unique recipe.

You just can't beat sweet and salty, and these cookies deliver! Whenever I bring these to a potluck, I call them my secret ingredient cookies. People really enjoy guessing what it is.

A note to anyone making these, you'll need about 2/3 to 3/4 of an 8 oz bag of ridged chips to get 2 cups. I use my food processor for this, pulsing until I get a good consistency.

These were good but not as amazing as I anticipated. I subbed the butterscotch chips for a mix of white milk and dark chocolate chips and I added 1 tsp of vanilla. It is very hard to detect the potato chips. Baked 4 min and then rotated trays and baked for an additional 4 minutes. They are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and a nice size and consistency. Just nothing special I prefer regular chocolate chip cookies.

These were good I will probably make them again maybe with chocolate chips next time. All three kids loved them and were very suprised when I told them they had potato chips in them will probably make again but maybe try with chocolate chips. Mine did thin out a little but not too bad.

Thought chips would add a little more crunchiness to cookie. OK but nothing great.
