This recipe's a great combination of flavors & veggies! Unfortunately, I got our spinach out of a bullk bin & wasn't spot-on w/the measurement of 10 oz. So, when I blended the spinach mixture, it came out really liquidy & less pesto-y.  It's also possible the the potatoes I bought were smaller than what the author of the recipe used. Overall though, the taste is great, but my mashed potatoes came out more like a thick soup (we cooked out a lot of the liquid though, by keeping it on the heat a little longer). But it tastes good & I'll try it again next time w/more exact measurements & maybe less veggie stock, to start off with, at least.  I would also suggest sauteeing the garlic for a better flavor before adding it to the spinach mixture.

This is a hard one to rate because as this recipe is written it is doomed to fail BUT using all the same ingredients just a different method these were a huge hit.   First, I didn't have red potatoes so I used russets, cooked in the chicken broth.  While the potatoes were cooking I made the spinach pesto in the food processor - garlic, spinach & olive oil - pulse to get it moving then let it run.  Then added the Parmesan to the food processor.  When the potatoes are tender - drain but reserve the cooking liquid (broth)  mash the taters with a hand held potato masher - adding a little bit of the reserved broth.  Add the spinach pesto - mash - add more broth if needed.  They are really delicious and low fat too.  If you don't want the garlic flavor - just leave it out.   Perfect for St. Patrick's Day!

The mashed potatoes part of this recipe for me turned out AWESOME,  and I will definitely cook those again! My pesto, like the previous reviewer's came out too liquidy, maybe because I used fresh spinach that I had on had measured out in cups yet might have messed up in the quantity conversion. Next time, I will put in the vegetable stock a bit at a time until I get the right consistency.

OK taste, but too runny.
