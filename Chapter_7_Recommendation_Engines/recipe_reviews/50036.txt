Really good and super moist.  I use fresh strawberries (halved, then sliced, about 2/3 cups worth) and add one medium diced banana.  Omitted the nuts -better this way.  (It's now my famous Pineapple Strawberry Banana bread - like the yogurt flavor)  Save the juice of the drained pineapple to make a glaze.  Glaze: 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 tablespoon pineapple juice.  Remove the bread from the pans and pour on top while it's still warm.  This adds tremendous flavor and keeps the bread SUPER moist.  If you want the glaze a little tangier, substitute w/ one tablespoon lemon juice.  If you want a sweeter bread, generously sprinkle light brown sugar on top b4 baking.  Fun, easy recipe that makes great dessert bread.  (Next time I'll make Strawberry Kiwi Bread)

This is soooo good and so quick and easy to make!  I used an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple instead of 1/2 of a 20 oz. can and it turned out great.

I wish I could give this more than five stars because it is SO GOOD!!!!  I chopped up some of the strawberries and halfed the rest.  I drained both the pineapple and the strawberries well before adding them in.  I used just a dash of cinnamon, substituted applesauce for half the oil, 1/2 cup of splenda baking mix for the sugar, and used whole wheat pastry flour.  Despite all these "healthy" changes, this is still the BEST quick bread I've ever made!!!

I made this recipe the first time, just as it is, but without the nuts. I loved it! However, I wanted to make it lower in fat and sugar, and I like muffins better, so I played with the recipe a bit. I tried using different sugar substitutes and found splenda to be the best. This is the new recipe with the adjustments I made: Strawberry-Pineapple-Banana Muffins. Preheat oven to 350. Grease two muffin tins, or line with muffin papers. Use 10 ounces of frozen strawberries (slightly thawed and cut up small); 1/2 (20 ounce) can of crushed pineapple, drained; 4 eggs, beaten; 1 cup applesauce; 2 small well-ripened bananas; 1 1/3 cup splenda; 1/3 cup honey; 1/3 cup sugar; 3 cups whole wheat flour; 1 tsp. baking soda; 1 tsp. salt; 2 tsp cinnamon. I combined all the dry ingredients, and all the wet ingredients, then added the dry to the wet like the original recipe. Bake for 15-20 minutes. They are so moist and delicious!

Excellent!  I used fresh strawberries and fresh pineapple, and Splenda instead of sugar, and it was delicious!  I had to bake it longer than an hour--maybe because of the fresh fruit?  But, it had a great flavor--we could taste the fruit easily--and my significant other has eaten almost an entire loaf since yesterday!  I would have made a glaze for it, but I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I sprinkled it with cinnamon-sugar before I baked it ... tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was as wonderful as I had hoped it would be!  I, too, had to make a few substitutions as my pantry was a bit low on some things.  I use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup peanut oil and 1 stick of margarine in place of the oil called for.  Otherwise, I made this recipe exactly as called for and it turned out deliciously!  I am a totally blind cook with chef aspirations so I love it when something like this comes along that is all but foolproof!  And, by the way, the peanut oil seemed to give it a bit of a nuttier flavor that enhanced the pecans that I used, since I was also out of walnuts.  I'll be watching for more recipes like this to make and give as Christms gifts this year!  Thanks so much to the contributor and all of you who wrote reviews.  It was all very helpful to me!

This was a great recipe!!  The bread is wonderful.  I'll have to grease the pans a bit more than I did this time because they stuck, but they were still fantastic!!

I did tweak the recipe from reviews.
I used whole pineapple slices, and just chopped them into chunks ( i used 6 slices or about 10 oz) i also used frozen whole strawberry, and just chopped those up too ( i used 12oz) I used only 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon of taste. I sprinkled about 1/4 cup of brown sugar onto the bread before baking. I also made the pineapple glaze. The bread was really good. And was house smelled sooooo goood !!!!! Must try

This recipe is definitely a keeper and a really nice alternative from banana bread. Only problem I had is that it burnt slightly, next time I'll reduce the cooking time a bit.

Firstly I would like to thank SUSIEQ203 who recommended this recipe to me via RE when I posted a request for a recipe to use up some strawberries.  I did make a few changes, not that the recipe required it but for my own personal preferences.  I am not a big fan of both pineapples and nuts so left them out.  I did use 4 mashed bananas in place of the pineapples.  I omitted the vegetable oil and used 1 cup of applesauce and Â¼ cup of walnut oil.  Used fresh instead of frozen strawberries.  I was just so pleased with this loaf, the taste and texture is wonderful.  One of the loaves is to take to a friends coffee morning tomorrow, looking forward to tasting the loaf once the flavors have sat overnight.  Thank you for sharing, just know I will be baking this again!

I thought this was delish.  I left out the nuts since I don't care for them.  I put in the whole can of pineapple, very well drained.  I used about 1 1/2 cups chopped frozen strawberries that I partially thawed, rinsed and drained to get rid of any extra water since they were a little frosty.  Because I had added a little extra fruit, I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup which still seemed like oodles. I also sprinkled raw sugar on top before I popped it into the oven.  This was a hit with my Bible Study group and my reputation as "the good cook" in the group remains intact!

Holy smokes - these are fabulous!  I made just a few changes - applesauce instead of oil, fresh fruit instead of frozen or canned, and no nuts.  I made half of the batter into muffins and half into a bread loaf.  These are some of the freshest-tasting I have ever made.  Will definitely make again!  
*Update - The muffins turned out better than the bread loaf.  I didn't bake the muffins for as long as the loaf- but the loaf ended up a little under cooked. May want to increase the baking time.

This recipe is really good although I did make some changes. I baked them in muffin cups & in my convection oven so between 35-40 minutes was sufficient to bake them. I also used chunks for the pineapple but that's a matter of personal preference! thanks!

Excellent!  My home frozen strawberries are in greater than 10 oz bags so I used some frozen cherries instead.   Gave one loaf as gift, other loaf didn't have a chance to cool before it was gone.

This is off the charts delish. I halved the recipe & got 3 mini loaves. I subbed most of the oil with applesauce (I did use a bit of oil). I left out the nuts, but added in 2 kiwis. So good! Almost like a cobbler baked into a bread. Yum!

I made this for my 2008 Christmas baking, and the "guinea pigs" were divided on the macadamias. The rest of the bread was delicious (I upped the amount of strawberries to about 1-1/4 cup) and used pecans instead of walnuts. I think, although macs are good, they may be a bit redundant in this recipe. Maybe double the pecans? Regardless, macadamias aside, everyone who tried this bread loved it. I will put it in my regular rotation, and those who would rather no macadamias will just get another flavor bread. :-)
Thanks!

Very good and easy to whip up.  My boys loved it.  I have a son who can't have dairy so I liked that there was none but still great flavor. The nread was very moist. I subbed some applesauce for the oil(I often do this with quick breads) and added one chopped banana that I had to use up).  Was too lazy to chop the nuts but will try next time. I may try cutting the sugar a bit...to  1/2 cups.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!!

This is fantastic! I made 2 loaves for our teachers' bread exchange, and thankfully had enough batter leftover to make a few mini muffins (otherwise, I'd have no idea how this turned out.) I took a few sugg'ns - reduced the oil and sugar a bit and added a mashed banana as well as a dash of vanilla...took a while longer to bake (~ 65-70 min) but so yummy. Very quick to whip up, too! I diced some frozen strawberries up the other day, kept thawing them to bake, then re-freezing when I realized I didn't have time...happy to say it didn't mess with end result.

Great bread and easy to make, followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved it too as strawberries and pineapple are his favorite, he even overlooked the nuts (as he usually doesn't like them).  Will make again!  Sold very well at a bake sale too!

This is ssooo yummy!  I used freshed strawberries, a little less sugar than called for, and replaced half of the oil with applesauce.  I also added a splash of vanilla. I was out of walnuts and was too lazy to chop up my macadamia nuts, so I just used pecans. We're eating it for breakfast this week and I'm givign the second loaf to my in-laws. I will make this again for sure!

I made half this recipe using fresh strawberries, an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple and I skipped the nuts.  In hindsight, I should have added the nuts, because I found I missed the crunch they provide.  This was moist and flavorful.  We liked it.

What a great idea. This recipe helped me use up some really ripe strawberries. I used another reviewer's suggestion and added a mashed banana (also overripe) in addition to the pineapple. This turned out very moist (I may decrease the oil next time though) and had a deliciously unique taste. I used pecans as these were the only nuts I had in the house, but they tasted very good. I'm thinking some coconut might not be bad either. I will definitely make this one again.

Very yummy and great way to use up strawberries! I gave it four stars just because if you made it with nuts, I think it would be yucky. I left out the nuts and used frozen strawberries that I sliced. I also used 1 c. unsweetened applesauce and only 1/4 c. oil. I used organic cane sugar instead of regular--I think it gives it a warmer/richer flavor. And the next time I make this, I will leave out the cininnamon--I don't think it goes well with the straberries and pineapple. That all said, my husband loved this, and took it all to work with him!

This recipe is great! I'm not a big fan of nuts so I left them out and added a banana. The bread was super moist.

Yummy bread! I used half oil, half applesauce, added 2 over-ripe bananas & a handful of blueberries. Loved the additions! I used a cup of chopped strawberries; however, next time I will add more because I couldn't taste them in the bread too much. My knife came out clean at only 40 minutes, but the top was a tad mushy when the bread cooled. Another 5 min. would have been perfect. Watch your time! Enjoy!

This is fabulous!  I had very large frozen strawberries, so I thawed them and mashed them before mixing up the recipe.  The can of pineapple I had was chunked rather than crushed, so I drained it and mashed those as well.  It was so juicy that I left out half of the oil that was called for.  I also left out the nuts, because of personal preference.

End result - Fabulous!

(Next time, I will try replacing the oil with no-sugar-added applesauce, since that seems to work well with most recipes.)

Better the second day!! I made a few revisions....I used all whole wheat flour (slightly heaping cups), 1/2 cup Splenda, 1 mashed banana, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts or macademia nuts. I did use whole strawberries, but next time I would use the sliced ones. I also glazed the loaves with a pineapple juice/powdered sugar glaze with some True Lemon powder while still warm. I didn't think it was very good at all right after it came out of the oven, but today I took it along to church and lots of people fussed about how good it was and even asked for the recipe!! I tasted it again today to see what they were talking about and it was a LOT better.

I thought this was OKAY....I used unsweetened strawberries and it wasn't as strawberry-ish as I would have liked.  The crust on the outside was really nice though--it had a nice texture.

I followed "Mommy From Seattle"'s recommendations. I have difficulty baking since I'm at about 6,000 ft. altitude. Considering that, this came out pretty good. It did seem a little too brown on the outside and slightly underdone on the inside, but I think this might be the altitude or perhaps the pan I'm using, because this is a common problem I have here with loaf breads. (For altitude, I adjusted the recipe by putting in just a smidgen less baking soda, less sugar and a little more flour.) My personal recommendation: this bread is better WITHOUT a glaze. For me, it was too sweet with the glaze.

It didn't say if the berries are the whole ones or the sliced ones with juice. I used a combination. It came out good except as it was cooling they fell in the middle. I put a almond flavor glaze on them and they tasted great. I'll try again with just whole berries.

So delicious and moist. Next time, though, I would use a shallower pan because baking it as a loaf took a much longer time to bake all the way through.

We enjoyed this mildly sweet & tasty fruit bread, thank you for the interesting recipe.
I found I needed to cover it with foil to avoid burning the top crust, and it needed an extra 12 minutes of baking time as it was still a bit wet in the center after 60 minutes. I used both fresh chopped strawberries (instead of frozen) and fresh chopped pineapple (instead of canned) because I had them on hand & needed to use them up.

Great way to use up strawberries. I use this recipe and courtney's muffin recipe (see reviews) as a guide, make my own alterations and use up my bananas and fresh pineapple as well. I double the baking soda and decrease the sugar in mine.

This was excellent! I had too many strawberries and wanted to use them while they were still good. Fresh strawberries, added a banana, and the rest of the recipe as is. I want to make it again using applesauce and other calorie cutting substitutes - this is a recipe you can definitely play with.

This was very moist and delicious. I used fresh strawberries because I had them, subbed half the white flour for wheat and used applesauce instead of oil. It was still very tasty.

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as directed with the exception of using a 14oz bag of frozen strawberries because that was the smallest the store had.  The cook time was exact.  Thanks for the yummy bread!

I also added some grounded flaxseed and a handful of rolled oats. The only nut I had on hand were almonds, so I used that instead. The applesauce idea sounds good, too!! This was amazing! (:

This recipe is AMAZING!  I made a few adjustments based on what ingredients I had on hand.  I used 2/3 cup fresh strawberries, diced.  I also included 2 medium-sized bananas, mashed.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  I only had 1 cup of vegetable oil, so I used 1/4 cup pure mango and orange juice to keep it moist.  I substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar and used sugar cinnamon instead of plain cinnamon.  Instead of making 2 loaves, I made one loaf and a dozen muffins.  Be sure to grease everything VERY well.  Finally, you may need to tent both the loaf and the muffins about twenty minutes in.  Together, both trays needed only 40 minutes baking time.

YUMMY!
   I made this bread (which is more like cake!), took it to work for a get- together. People raved about it and I had to give in and tell them that it wasn't my own recipe! I gave them the Allrecipe's website and by the end of the day someone had a stack of copies of the recipe. What a truly yummy recipe! Thanx much!

This bread is good, and I like the texture of the crust, but I think it lacks strawberry flavor. Maybe its because i put the strawberries and pineapples in a blender before adding them, but I'll definetely try adding more strawberries next time. However, worth the effort! and worth tweaking to make it perfect.

This was so yummy. I will definitely make this one again seeing as how the first batch will not last through the day. Adding the glaze that was recommended in another review was delicious.

What a wonderful quick bread!  And it was a hit at my church.  Don't change a thing in this recipe--except you might throw in some big hunks of macadamia nuts so people get an extra treat once in a while!

This recipe is fantastic! I adjusted according to the first reviewerâs recommendations (except didnât add bananas), and I baked in a bundt pan and added pineapples on the top (see photo). Then I glazed with the pineapple juice and powdered sugar. Tasted amazing and will make again!

This is delicious!  Very easy and tasty.  It makes two nice sized loafs.  We gave one away as a thank you present to the store manager of Lowes and he absolutely loved it!  I will definitely make it again!

Disappointing. Just not a lot of strawberry or pineapple flavor. Actually, really only tasted Like cinnamon   The  only modifications I made was to use fresh strawberries (even added a few more than the 10 oz recommendation) and split the oil with 1/2 portion of applesauce / half oil.  Won't try again.

I loved this recipe! Decided to make muffins sine I was taking this to the office, and they turned out great. The reviews on Allrecipes are awesome, and I followed suit, using 1 cup canola oil, 1 1/2 cup sugar & a tablespoon vanilla.  These are a great in-the-go breakfast, too!

Second review:
I really wanted to make this again but the strawberries went bad so I knew I had frozen blueberries and tried it. 
I stuck to the recipe, aside from the berries, and added two bananas.
A total hit!

I made this recipe to use the fresh pineapple and strawberries I had leftover from a party. It was a great recipe to try. I took tips from a few others and made the bread into muffins, reduced the amount of oil by using 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 of oil, and omitted the nuts. I also put the glaze of pineapple juice mixed with powdered sugar and it work out great.  Yum, I'd make it again.

This is a delicious quick bread.  I did make a few changes after reading reviews. I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 3/4 cup canola oil, cut down the sugar to one cup and used pecans instead of the nuts in the receipe.  I will be making this again!

Made it just as instructed but added 1  1/2 cups blueberries. I used walnuts  only because I didn't have  macadamia nuts. It was wonderful. Will be making this again. It is a keeper.

This bread is AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used cashews instead of macadamia nuts. Also used the pineapple glaze recommended in one of the other reviews and added some extra crushed pineapple on top after cooking. I baked one loaf in a glass loaf pan and the other in a circular metal cake pan and both turned out wonderful (for the glass pan I lowered the temp 25 degrees to 325F and cooked it for a little longer than the recommended time). This is definitely a fool proof recipe that yields fantastic results! Much thanks to the poster!

Pretty darn good - tastes better the longer it stays in the refrigerator. A bit sweet and a tad too many macadamia nuts for me.  I used 2 bag that said about 1/2 cup each and when I put in cup it measured 3/4 cup as in recipe - I think I would stick to 1 bag. I used 12 oz fresh strawberries and one 8 oz can of pineapple as someone else suggested so no leftovers. Very moist.

This bread is delicious!  I made a couple changes; I used whole wheat pastry flour, no nuts, egg replacer, and the whole can of drained pineapple. It was moist and flavorful. I will definitely be using this in my Christmas baskets.

This was very good and I will add this to my recipe box with my alterations to our taste.  I did make this exactlly as written.  I did not like the nuts and prefer fresh fruit and half a cup less sugar.  Also I will probably puree the fruit from now on so there are not gaps when the fruit cooks down.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe.
I did a few changes:
 (1) Used the juice from the pineapples as part of the liquids. 
 (2) Replaced the oil with 3/4 cup of applesauce (see juice above)
 (3) Replaced the eggs with egg beaters
 (4) Cut the sugar inhalf
 (5) Omitted the cinammon; I did not think it would go well with the strawberries.
 (6) Made muffins instead of a loaf and cooked them 25 minutes.

They came out perfect!

This is a great tasting bread, but the strawberries ended up leaving big holes in the bread and kind of cooked down to nothing. Not sure how I can avoid this. Still, very tasty!

Great recipe excluded nuts as a personal preference!! The Pineapple flavor is not very prevalent, but it is still a very good and unusual sweet dread. I would think this recipe could be made using any fruit and or fruit combination. I topped each loaf with a crumb topping.
