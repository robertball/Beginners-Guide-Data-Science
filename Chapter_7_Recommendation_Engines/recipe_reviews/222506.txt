Great recipe ! But it really doesn't need the beef broth. just saute the cabbage , adding a little bit of sugar (it brings out the natural sweetness of the cabbage and onions) with the kielbassa.  when it gets to the texture you prefer add the boiled pierogies.  toss together--YUM

Mmmm Mmmm! Delish! What a great comfort food. I didn't add the beef broth, this recipe doesn't need it. The cabbage & onions will get tender enough in the skillet with just the butter. A+!

This was delicious!!!  I made this using the "Pierogi (Polish Dumpling)" recipe on this site intesd of using frozen.  Also, I cooked the onion and cabbage for a little bit, then added no sodium beef broth and covered.  When the cabbage was done, I put it in a bowl, melted a little butter in the pan and added the kielbasa & pierogies until they got a little carmelization.  It was amazing!

Our favorite recipe using kielbasa.  I pre-cook the kielbasa on the grill for added flavor.

Great recipe. I didn't feel like it needed the broth either. The sauteed onions and cabbage are a perfect match for the sausage and pierogies. Mmm!

Pretty tasty. I ended up cutting keilbsas into 1/2 moons, and mixed it all together to cook after the initial cabbage and onion cooked for a whole. Served with mustard to dip sausages in.

I thought it was great. Smelled yummy, tasted yummy. I used the broth, but didn' t follow the cooking instructions, kind of just used one pot - started w/cabbage and onions, threw in the pierogis, about 10 min later threw in the kielbasa and broth, and let it simmer for about 10....yum

There is no need to call them to dinner, the smell of this cooking takes care of that. This is a five star meal! I followed the recipe except I added a sprinkle of smoked paprika with the salt & pepper. It's a keeper!

This was good.  My kids liked it.  I did not have cabbage, so I just left it out.  Left out the broth too.  I will probably make it again.  I never know what to do with pierogies, so this was a good change.

The dish is pretty good but be sure to use a very flavorful sausage or the dish may come out a bit bland. The sausage is definitely the star of the dish.

I was looking for a good polish home cooked meal to serve to my husbands family and found this recipe.  It is absolutely delicious!! I flowed directions but substituted an amber beer instead of the beef broth.  I doubled the recipe to feed more and had to transfer all of it in a large stock pot to simmer at the end.  I also  made sure to use a quality polish kielbasa.  Everyone raved and complimented the dish!! Great recipe!!!

Love this recipe, it's so easy!  I made it with pierogi's then I made it with chunked potatoes about the size of the cut of kielbasa, both ways were really nummy.  Didn't add the beef broth either time and all was okay!

I liked this. It made an easy one pot meal. I didn't have 20 full oz of pierogies, so I cut the recipe in half. I used red cabbage and sliced pre-cooked flavored chicken sausage, because it is what I had to use. I am certain it would be even better with the green milder cabbage. The only issues are, I made 1/2 recipe and using a pan with 3" sides it just barely fit the ingredients. I suppose the full recipe would require cooking in 2 batches. I also cut the cooking time way down after adding each ingredient to 5-6 minutes or less. I would consider making this again, if even for convenience sake. ty

We made this last night, exactly as stated in the recipe, with no alterations. It was wonderful. Everyone in the family loved it and ate most of it. The little dab left over I saved for myself for lunch today. It was just as good reheated.

This was excellent. Very easy to prepare, comes together quickly. I also didn't use beef broth, and I wonder if beer would have changed the flavor in a negative way. Although I didn't add sugar, it had a bit of a sweet taste, probably from the onion. I would definitely recommend this dish without any changes.

This is VERY good. Like many others, I didn't use the broth. I am however wondering where to find more flavor for this. I charred the sausage and perogies a little for the candied flavor..very nice but I'd like to find even a little MORE flavor. Perhaps just a stronger flavoured sausage next time.

My husband loves this recipe so much he asked for it for Valentine's Day.  Instead of broth, I use 1 can of  french onion soup.  It makes the dish taste so much richer and flavorful.  We usually double the recipe to have enough for planned-overs.

I absolutely love this dish! The only thing I did different than the recipe is I used the crockpot and instead of chopping an onion I bought Mr. & Mrs. T’s potato and onion pierogis. It is now one of my favorite meals!

Great!  My 15 year old LOVED this!!  I tried to do it exactly as written, but didn't quite know how it would go with the approx. 20 minutes of browning the pierogies.  I kind of accomplished it and liked the flavor it added (I wasn't sure what temperature to set the stove and was afraid of scorching them).  In order to get extra sausage flavor, I browned the kielbasa sausage first, and then added the onions and cabbage to that.

Delicious! Cooked cabbage and onion in butter.  Removed from pan and then melted butter before adding boiled pierogies and kielbasa. Browned these, added back in cabbage and onion and served! Voila! Delicious dinner!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made it without the cabbage because I didn't have any and my daughter doesn't care for it.  I cooked my sausage first and browned it. I removed it and cooked the onions in the butter until almost caramelized in the same pan. Then I added the sausage back in. I made the Pierogies as directed and added only a 1/2 cup of beef broth. Came out great! Family loved it! Quick and Easy! Will be making again.

Great dish, my pickey eaters even liked this dish! I doubled the recipe and tried to make it...difficult, didn't have a large enough frying pan to fry the pierogi eps with the cabbage and onion. Do your self a favor, don't double the recipe, just make it multiple times. Great dish as a main or a side!

This was a big hit with my husband. We didn't have an onion so I used dried chopped onion, and consumme instead of broth, but it turned out excellent! I cooked the pierogies a bit too long so they were kind of mushy, and didn't really have a pan big enough to brown them all in the bottom with the other ingredients, but they still turned out good. I'll be adding this to my regular dinner menu.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. However, I'm not sure about the directions as written, so I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I have what I consider a "large skillet" , but for the life of me I don't know how I could "push aside the cabbage/onion kielbasa" and put all the pierogy on the bottom of the pan. I had to take it out of the skillet entirely.  Also, cooking them in the skillet for 20 minutes would probably burn them. I cooked everything for less time than stated. I think you do need some of the beef broth, but maybe not the full cup.

I mixed pierogies and cabbage together.I just forgot to brown them on skillet before. I used boiling water from pieogies instead of broth.It came out good too.

I made a gluten-free version of this by subbing steamed cauliflower (al-dente) for the pierogi. I added the cauliflower after the kielbasa pieces. Just added freshly ground pepper as the kielbasa and butter has enough salt flavor. Great taste without pirogies.

Delicious! The whole family loved it. I excluded the butter to make it healthier. It was a hit and I will be making again soon.

Normally I like to follow the recipe provided but I took the suggestion of many and left out the broth.  It is sooo good without it.  Tonight I don't have pierogies like I did the first time I made this so I'm using gnocchi instead.  They also require boiling first and are made from potatoes. 
Thanks for a non tomato based option for kielbasa!

This was and continues to be one of my families favorite winter night meals. This is so easily prepared and is great just on its own or paired with a fresh green salad and a nice beer, makes a company meal as well.
