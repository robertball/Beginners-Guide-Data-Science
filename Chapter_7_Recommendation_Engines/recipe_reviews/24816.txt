Very nice! fresh and tasty... didn't care too much for vinegar, so I added a tablespoon of lemon juice for the zing part, it also helped keep the apples crisp white. Might try adding raisins next time.

I added roasted pine nuts instead of the walnuts and a bit more vinegar. Very tasty that way. Thank you.

Loved this Salad. So much you can do with the basic concept. Made it last night but with ready to use coleslaw from the store. Cut up one apple, one stalk of celery, handful of walnuts added to coleslaw.  For the dressing I like to put 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vinegar added to the mayonaise and mixed together. The vinegar helps the apples to keep from going brown.

Lemon juice on the apples was someone's good suggestion for this recipe. Fresh apples and the mild crunchy cabbage together were just what my body seemed to need tonight. My 7-year-old even said, "For some reason, I like this salad."

I enjoyed this recipe and am making it again today.  Easy and tasty.  Not quite as zingy as I would like, but very good.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good!  I added a tablespoon of vinegar after reading the review of wanting 'zingy'.

Very easy salad to make and delicious.  Didn't have walnuts so used chopped almonds.  My husband is picky on salads and loved this, great summer salad!

Very good. I tossed the apples in lemon juice before adding them to the salad. I also threw in some dried cranberries and green onions that I needed to use up. Rather than mixing in the walnuts, I sprinkled them on top for a prettier presentation.

Wanted to use up leftover cabbage, and decided I wanted a cabbage type of a salad.  Well I found this gem and it’s delicious.  We all loved it.  Each of us discussed certain things we would put into it like Feta and Bleu cheese chunks next time.  This recipe does not need to be adjusted unless it’s for dietary reasons.  It’s simple, basic ingredients and I intend on making it weekly.  Served it with fish and Brussels sprouts.  Thank you for your submission!!

This salad is really delicious!  I made it for a large group so I used a huge cabbage.  I doubled the mayonnaise to cover the extra cabbage, and left the other ingredients the same.

We really liked this salad, so fresh tasting. I made two changes, I forgot to put the sugar in and I didn't miss it. The other change was adding 1 tbs of white wine vinegar to the apples. I will make this again, thanks for sharing.
