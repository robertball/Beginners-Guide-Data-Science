These are excellent cake-like brownies. Great flavor and easy to make. These are ingredients that I usually have on hand. I also added 1/2 C. of chocolate chips. I will definitely be making these again!....I just made these for a second time, but decided to try to make them moister. They came out even better! Not quite chewy, but definitely very moist. Here are the changes: use less than half of the butter to melt with the chocolate. Use the remaining butter, softened, to cream w/ the sugar. Add eggs and then chocolate mixture with liquor. Then add the remaining ingredients...I decreased the flour to  1 1/2 Cups.

I found a similar recipe online before I found this one.  It called for 4 TBS of coffee liqueur instead of a 1/4 cup... I wish I used the 1/4 cup!  

Glaze with 1 1/4 cups Powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons Coffee liqueur 

Best brownies ever!

I just did not like these at all- reason being- mainly- they ABSOLUTELY should nt be called "Brownies".  They are not a brownie in any way shape or form.  They are a cake- not a wonderful cake, but it could just be because I was desperate for a brownie.  This did not at all fill the need.  Sorry.

Im going to retry the recipe and add some salt as well as take the suggestions above on the first review.  The brownies came out moist, but there is too much flour in the recipe. To compensate I toasted marshmallows under the broiler with some chocolate chips, exgtra walnuts and a bit of Hershey's syrup. I put a kaluah and powdered sugar glaze on it to give a caramelized topping effect.

Very rich.  I successfully substituted one-third of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and replaced the nuts with chocolate chips.

Very good and rich.  They are very cakelike instead of fudgy.  I have tried using two eggs instead of three and they are pretty crumbly without the extra egg.  If anyone else has any ideas about how to make them a bit more fudgy, they would be about perfect.

Definitely needs a glaze.  The marshmallow idea below sounds good, and I am doing that next!

I can't get over how amazing these brownies are.  Best I have ever tried making.  I LOVE Khaluah so I used it in this recipe and they came so moist.  The alcohol just gives it an extra boost.  I am going to make these again and again!

They tasted fine straight out of the oven, I added more alcohol than it called for and still they were not very boozy.  The next day they consolidated into quite moist unappetising bricks though, brrr I didn't like these at all and wonâ€™t make again

Good tasting, but slightly dryer than I expected, and I usually prefer fudgy brownies to cakey ones.  Does anyone know a good conversion to make this recipe fudgy?  Fewer eggs?  More liquid?

This is a nice variation on the typical chewy brownie.  I drizzled a little mixture of confectioner's sugar and Kahlua to jazz them up a bit.
