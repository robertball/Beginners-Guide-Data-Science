This recipe was scrumptious. I dipped the veal in egg before coating with flour mixture with a small amount of seasoned bread crumbs (just enough to give the veal more texture when cooking)
I also doubled all the ingredients (except veal) and added mushrooms in step 3.  Before adding the remaining chicken stock (I used chicken broth) I mixed 2tsp of cornstarch w/ the broth.
This Recipe is definitely a keeper
Thanks Terri!!

I was so tempted to rate this significantly lower than four stars, for the sheer reason that if you were to cook veal scallopine as long as this recipe tells you to you'd totally ruin this dish. Totally.  Saute the veal 2-3 minutes a side and leave it at that.  Lean, tender veal needs very little cooking time. Having said that, if you don't overcook this, it's out of this world, (5-star) awesome delicious.  Chicken breasts, turkey cutlets or lean pork, pounded thin, would be fine substitutes for expensive veal scallopine.  Best served with a lightly seasoned pasta (garlic and olive oil).  For something a little different, however,  I served this with "Linguine with Marinated Tomato and Basil," also from this site.

very good recipe!  My husband, who normally doesn't like marsala, thought it was great!  So did I!  Just be sure to pound all veal before breading so that it will truly be tender!

This came out very well.  My mother couldn't stop obsessing about it tasted like 'restaurant food'.  I substituted chicken breasts for the veal due to budget constraints, but I think the general idea of the dish was able to shine through despite this.  One thing I would change for next time would be to use reduced salt chicken broth instead of the bouillon, as I found it quite salty.  I must reiterate that this is really good though.  Hell, my mom's making tomorrow night she liked it so much!  Thank you Terri Lyons.

This was very good. I used half chicken stock and half beef stock for a more full bodied sauce. I also used sweet marsala and a bit of sherry as that is what I had on hand. I increased the stock to compensate for the sweetness of the marsala and added a bit more butter. Very good recipe!

We had terri's veal tonite what a dish was simply delicious. I made very few changes, I added mushrooms unforunately I only had canned mushrooms. This would have to do, so after I cooked the veal and removed it from the pan I added the mushrooms saute them a little while looked nice in color and removed them I then continued with the reciepe just as it was. we will have this dish again and again. we loved it thankyou terri

to the previous reviewer, the term scallops in this recipe refers to the cut of the veal, not actual scallops.

This was a hit. I made it ahead following the steps being careful not to over cook.  Sauce separated in reheating but it was still delicious.

Very good. I used more Marsala wine and added a thickening agent. I also added one apple, sliced thin and quartered as well as some rasins. It made a Great Sauce that I plan to use on pork chops as well.

a little sweet, added a bit more stock to tame down the sweetness.Added fresh mushrooms at the end that I had sauteed in some butter.  I think the cooking time is a bit long, but not a bad recipe all in all.

This was excellent.  After browning the veal, I placed it in a crock pot.  I sauteed some mushrooms and doubled the sauce and put it over the veal in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 3 hours - it was so tender.  Will definately be making this often!

8/2008 -- made with pierogies.  Kevin thought it was the best meal I ever made! I took the pieropies out when I egan to start cooking...they were half frozen, half defrosted by the time I put them into the pan.  they came out great (used 1/2 butter and half live oil) for cooking them.

Sorry but I just did not like which is a shame because veal marsala is one of my favorite dishes.  I also think the cooking time is way too long.

Very good base recipe which to add one's personal preferences. I used pork scallopini and added mushrooms, sliced baby carrots, and crushed rosemary to bring out the pork. Next time I think I'll try veal and pair it with spaetzle.

Oh my word!!  This was absolutely awesome!!  I basically followed this recipe but also used some other reviewers techniques too.  I added Italian Seasoning bread crumbs to flour mixture and garlic powder.  I dipped the veal in egg first then flour mixture.  When it came to the sauce I used marsala and chicken broth, brought to boil, then added fresh garlic, fresh mushrooms, and the meat back in the sauce, simmered on low for 15 min., while that was simmering, in a glass measuring cup I added 1/4 cup more chicken broth, 1/4 more marsala, and 2 tsp. cornstarch, mixed up well.  Took meat out, and added cornstarch mixture.  Totally delightful!!!  :)

This was a quick, easy and tasty meal.  I used chicken breasts instead of veal and made a little more sauce to make sure that I had enough.  I also added minced shallots and garlic.  The recipe also doubles very well!

Just tried this recipe tonight and it was a huge hit! Followed the recipe just as written but used chicken.  My husband loved it and was quite excited to learn there was enough for seconds.  I can't wait to try this with veal!  Thanks Terri for a delicious recipe.

It was pretty darn good! Although it needs more sauce ingredients as my sauce basically just dried up in the cooking process.  But honestly the tenderness and flavor more than made up for it! Definitely restaurant quality when perfected! Made it with some buttered noodles, Italian bread/herb dip, and some spinach salad and I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant!

Once again I made Terri's awesome veal recipe and consider it my go to recipe for quick and scrumptious.  I'm very proud to call her my personal cooking inspiration and friend.  I don't change anything in the recipe and it always turns out like restaurant gourmet.  My husband, who's quite picky at meals raves about this one.  Thanks for this recipe Terri.
