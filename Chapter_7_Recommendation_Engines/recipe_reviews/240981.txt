Best brats I ever had. The thing is I pierce each brat a number of times and simmer them on low in a slow cooker over night.

This is one of my husbands favorites!  We have ate this several times.  We purchase the German Brats from our local butcher shop who always has  quality meat & brats.   This receipe has  great taste & the Brat just melts in your mouth.  I do use  organic maple syrup, have not tried the honey,concerned my husband would notice but, that too sounds good!

Unique way to serve bratwurst!  I used a dark German beer that had a little taste of molasses.  Maple syrup went well with it. This recipe is not sweet. It doesn't taste like maple. All the ingredients blend well with the sausage  spices to create a delicious flavor. The onions are wonderful.  I'd add even more than a cup. The sausage is very tender and melts in your mouth. The left overs are just as tender.  I gave this a 4 because not all my guests liked it. Some were expecting the traditional bratwurst,  and were disappointed.  The majority loved it, including my family.

Good flavor; used honey instead of maple syrup.  Doesn't have as nice a texture as when finished by grilling, but still enjoyed.
