This was excellent and super simple. I didn't expect to like the cream cheese in this but it worked very nicely. It gave the chicken a nice creaminess but it wasn't so much that all of the other flavors got lost. Even the 15 minute bake time was spot on. The tortilla's were perfectly browned and the cheese perfectly melted. The tortilla's I had on hand were much bigger so mine were more like burritos but same principle. I've made similar recipes in the past but this one has them all beat. Thanks for sharing!

Great taste. Made by the recipe. A little too hot for us, but that is just a personal preference. Good recipe.

I made this and it turned out great. Depending on the size of the tortillas and weight of the chicken you'll get closer to 20. I used most of a Mission taco size flour 20 pack.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Sauce. I'd add some hot sauce next time to boost the spice to my taste, but as is they'd please a crowd.

This is an excellent recipe once you adjust to your preferred heat level. I used Sweet Baby Rays Buffalo Wing sauce. I used the recommended amount (3/4 cup) and it was hot!  My first batch of taquitos were barely edible due to the heat. I like mild heat. For my second batch, instead of using a spoonful of chicken I did a small layer of the chicken and a ton of cheese (approximately 4:1 cheese to chicken ratio) and they were AMAZING!  Next time I make it I will dramatically reduce the amount of Wing Sauce so I can have more chicken in each taquito.  
I used a convection oven. I kept the 425 degrees temp but the cook time was reduced to 8-9 minutes. No need to flip for browning purposes, but if you donâ€™t flip them the cheese runs out as it melts.

Great taste! Turned out a little dry, however - but it may be because I only used about 1/3 of the hot sauce because my wife is a wimp. I may add  some black beans to the mix next time, or use a milder sauce, or find a new wife (just kidding!)

Second time I made it, was better - not as dry. Added a little more sauce and chicken broth.

Family loved it! We used light ranch dressing instead of the ranch packet, light cream cheese and low fat cheese as well as low carb tortillas.

Loved it!  The only change I made was I added fresh spinach. We made some with whole wheat tortillas and some with white. The white turned out crispier but I liked the flavor of the whole wheat better. My son liked these and that never happens. I served these as a meal with a ramekin of blue cheese dressing on the side.
