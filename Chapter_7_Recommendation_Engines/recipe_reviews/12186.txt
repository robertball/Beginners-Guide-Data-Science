dough was hard to knead. fell apart whenever touched. and was impossible to get thin enough for pie. i definitely will not be going through that again!

I used half lard & half butter - it came out flaky, tender and yummy. It was a little difficult to work with, but I think that is my peoblem with pie crust in general, and not necessarily the recipe. I would definately make it again!!!

I have made my pie crust this way for years, except my formula was also half as much water as shortening.  If it's too "wet" you can always add a little more flour.  Too dry, add more water.  I also add just a pinch of salt mixed in with the flour.  Have always gotten compliments for my pie crusts.  Grandma used to use lard, but I've always just used white shortening. Also, I never chill it.

A bit of salt will help it brown.  About a teaspoon should be right.

This has always been my "Idiot Proof" pie crust recipe that I originally got out of a Peg Bracken book and also from a magazine where it was called Grama Rose's pie crust.  My version has always been 1/2 as much water as lard/shortening/butter combo,and 1/2 as much lard/shortening/butter combo as flour.  Could it be any easier?  Easy to roll out and can be chilled or frozen. Used and approved by Sue in Kanada.

I was in a hurry when I made this, and I halved it.  I also did not pay attention to the directions and in my infinite wisdom decided to put it in the food processor.  My suggestion would be to not do those things.  I ended up adding flour bc I messed it up so much, which ended up with a really flaky and floury crust I could only press into my quiche pan.  It worked okay, and no one but me knew I messed it up, but take note and try not to do what I did.  I'm definitely not marking this recipe down for my mistakes, but I'll try it again--as directed--to see what I think then.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the same recipe that my grandma has been using for years. Good tip -chilling the dough makes it a lot easier to work with, but you can roll it right away if you like.

i was going to reserve judgement until after i ate this but this was the worst pie crust mess i ever had...and that was without adding the water. way too much shortening. i had to add at least another cup of flour and then doctor it up so ended up with twice as much (hopefully salvageable) pie crust than i needed

I have been making my crust this way since watching Alton Brown make it.  Don't over mix and the crust will be perfect every time.
