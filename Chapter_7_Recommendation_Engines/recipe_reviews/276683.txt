I made this several times, and it was delicious.  For us, I omitted the additional 1 tsp. of salt, which we didn't miss at all.  If you can't find Boursin, you can use Philadelphia (spreadable) cream cheese w/herbs.  It comes in a little tub.

I think it’s only fair that I rate this recipe highly because I didn’t make it according to the instructions so anything I didn’t particularly care for might have been of my own doing...although I liked my changes. I used rotisserie chicken because I was lazy, I forgot to get mushrooms at the store, and I added frozen spinach to make it a one skillet meal. The next time I make it, I will try to remember to get the mushrooms because I think they’ll be good but I am going to continue to include the spinach, it was an excellent addition!
