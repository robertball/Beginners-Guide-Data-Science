This recipe has been in our family for over 40 yrs. But my goodness, whats with all of the sugar. This is not dessert. Less is more ! Also WAY TOO much sour cream , a goodly dollop will do. Also I always add garlic powder to give it the best flavor. Otherwise it is a great recipe. (from my precious Hungarian mother in law).

Delicious cucumber salad!  I put a little salt in with the water so I didn't have to let this sit overnight.  It works with or without dill (did half and half).  The dressing is very good, the perfect mixture of sweet and tart.

I make a very similar Cucumber Salad but instead of soaking overnight I peel, slice super thin into a colander over a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt.  Put a bowl or dish on top of the cucumbers to press out the liquid.  Let stand for a good hour or more.  Mix up your dressing in the meantime--I always add fresh dill 1/3  cup or so and Fresh parsley also about 1/3 cup or so.  Sugar to taste.  I like to let the dressing and drained cukes meld so usually make this in the morning for an evening meal.  Delicious with Steaks and Baked potatoes!!---I usually do my potatoes by slicing them into thick disks and inserting onion between each disk.  Sprinkle with seasoned salt and fresh cracked pepper, then drizzle with olive oil right into the foil packet.  throw on the grill for 45 - 60 min---so deelish!

Ding-Ding-Ding We have a winner! The cucumbers came out sooo crispy and the sweet tart dressing was just perfect. If you are a dill lover, this would be good to add as well. Now we know what to do with that bumper crop of cukes. Additional note: Serve Immediately!

I have been making this for years, except I add sliced sweet onions and only use english cukes (burpless). I have never soaked the cukes first. I just add the cukes and onion to the dressing and refridgerate until the flavors blend. (at least 3-4 hours). If you want to take this recipe one step farther, add cooked rotini pasta before refrigeration. The grandkids Love it.

This as is was WAY to sweet for me!  So here were the changes I made I only added 2 tablespoon of sugar to this.  The mixture was very soupy which I didnt mind to much.  I also added some cracked black pepper.

I forgot to add that it works best if you peel the cucumber beforehand.  Thanks for the great reviews!

This is very good and a great summer side-dish. I think the next time I will reduce the sugar some.

I thought I invented it myself - which I did, that's funny.  I cut the cucumber down the middle and remove some of the seeds by running a spoon down the middle.  I add sliced red onion and radishes sometimes for color.

It's not necessary to do the 4 hour or overnight soak in my opinion, just mix it all up (with some sliced onion if you like!) and refrigerate while you fix the rest of your dinner. I thought the vinegar to sugar ratio was perfect! I have used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and you can hardly tell the difference!

Great sauce recipe. I slice my cucumbers as paper thin as possible. Second time I made it, I added paper-thin sliced onion, and a tablespoon of Dill (to taste!) and a little extra vinegar. Also used Apple Cider vinegar instead of white. Thanks! :)

I will have to agree with the previous review. Too sweet and too much sour cream. I will try it again cutting back the sugar in half as well as the sour cream and vinegar. I did add thinly sliced onion and garlic powder for taste.

Wonderful! I've eaten cucumber salad over the years, several different family members make it, but I've never actually made it myself. So when I found really fresh, great looking cucumbers at a REALLY low price at the farmers market, I knew what I wanted to make. Only one problem...all those years of eating cucumber salad and I never bothered to ask anyone for a recipe! Allrecipes saves the day again! This is a great base recipe to get the vinegar/sugar ratio correct, then it's easily customizable. I added dill, lemon pepper, celery salt and onion powder(not a fan of raw onions). I also used fat-free sour cream, going to try plain Greek yogurt next time. Even after salting(to get the water out) 4 VERY large cucumbers, the sauce was a little thin(although the sauce still clung to the slices). Next time I'll have to serve it with a slotted spoon, but I think my family might disagree with me on that, as they used their dinner rolls to mop up the sauce that pooled on their plates...yes, the sauce is that good! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this salad!  I use light sour cream and add finely chopped vidalia onion. I serve it as a topping for cubed boiled potatoes or just as a side dish.

Very, very good! II made this without any changes, using a scant 1/3 cup of sugar, and adding a few thin sliced onions. I have a feeling this will be a staple around here this summer. Would be great to take to potlucks! Delicious!

I wish I could give this more stars. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Now I double the number of cucumbers, and add thinly sliced Vidalia onions. Great way to use up a garden full of cucumbers. thank you tarawvu for a great recipe.

This is a tasty recipe for cucumbers.  I made two changes; I only used 2 teaspoons of sugar and 3 teaspoons of vinegar.  Otherwise it would be too sweet.  There is no need to soak the cucumbers for 4 hours.  Add salt to them and let soak in a colander for an hour.

I made these as written and didn't quite like the taste at first but after they set awhile, I loved them.  I would definitely make these again and let them set before serving.  They make a quick, easy side dish.

I add dill weed for flavoring.  I also use a lot of salt to draw out the moisture from the cucumbers.  Just layer the cukes with salt and draw out the water.  Then rinse it well to get as much salt off as possible.  I've made this both with the sour cream and without.  Both are good.  I also slice in an onion.  Recently I had some summer squash that I didn't know how to use.  I prepped it just like the cukes and got a nice side dish.  The recipe as presented is really a good basic one.  Take it to the next level with your own touches.

Wonderful recipe.   With the exception of adding onions, I followed the ingredients exactly.   I did not soak the cukes overnight and I don't really think that part is necessary.   I will make again.

This is a recipe I grew up on. My Hungarian Mother made it weekly, though she added a little paprika for garnish and flavor. I also add just a bit of garlic. Less sugar, closer to a 1/4 cup. It's a favorite and a unique side dish for the holidays.

Good basic recipe  Recipes are meant as a guide can can your own touches 2 Tablespoons sugar is plenty for me I usually use Splenda or Sugar twin  you can also use dill and/or garlic or garlic powder After browsing thru these recipes, I found found some that use up to 2 cups of sugar making it like candy not a salad

So happy to see this recipe. My grandmother would always make this when I was growing up. I remembered the sour cream and vinegar and sugar but not the ratio. Brings back great memories. Thank you

This has such a yummy, quick and very easy dish to make and serve.  I made a few changes that I feel made a huge difference.  I added some finely chopped red onion and a couple teaspoons of dill.  We were going to eat it quickly, so I didn't even bother to soak the cucumbers.  We didn't have any problems!  Pure yummyness!!

I'm making it for the second time!!! So good and easy. I salted the cucumbers lightly and let them drain in a colander for a half an hour first. I also found that this makes quite a bit of dressing so I added two more cucumbers and a quarter finely chopped onion.

Good cucumber salad, but it's very sweet. I added a dash of onion powder to the sour cream mix for a bit more flavor & used apple cider vinegar only because I ran out of white. This was good, I will make this again, but probably cut down on the sugar a bit. Thanks for sharing :)

I reduced serving size to 6 and used one cucumber.  It was pretty good and I've made this several times. I like this recipe better with no fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

I cut the recipe in half since I only had one cucumber and I have to say, I'm rather glad I did. This really didn't go over that well. I only added 1 tbsp on sugar and it was still too much. This would be a much better dish if the sugar was completely omitted.

If you like them less soupy, which we do, salt the cucumbers and let them set for at least 1 hour.  I rinse the salt off but you don't have to.  This is actually a very good base for a sauce.

This is the same way I make mine but with less sugar. I like the "slightly" sweet and sourness 1/3 cup is way to much. I also like my cucumbers peeled and salted than rinsed with water, drained and with sliced onions added. This was always the way my mom did it!!

I don't know how they consider this to provide 12 servings.  It looks like it would make 4 servings at the most.  Clearly next we will calculate to double this recipe.

This recipe is great and we make it all the time, but we take it easy on the sugar. Less sugar as possible and a bit of garlic salt really does the trick. Other than that I definately recomend it.

This was tasty and refreshing on a hot summer day!! I did not bother soaking the cucumbers in water - my cucumbers were garden fresh and crispy enough already. I just mixed the sauce up and added the cucumbers and some chopped onion. It was a great side dish with sloppy joes and homemade oven-fried french fries!

I made this tonight only I added finely diced red onion to it and added that to the sauce while the cucumbers were soaking in salt water. Turned out awesome! Only thing I may do differently next time would be to reduce the amount of sugar.

I salted the sliced cucumbers and let them sit for half an hour. Rinsed and dried them. I cut the dressing ingredients in half since many reviewers said there was too much.  I’m one of those “dip your fork into the dressing” people, so too much is TOO much. The balance of flavors was spot on. This one is a keeper.

Way to sweet and to much dressing for the amount of cukes called for in this recipe.  I really wanted this recipe to work, as I was searching for a similar recipe.  Cut back on the sugar and amt. of Sour cream and it might work.  However I always give it a try as the recipe is written, and this doesn't work.

As written, it's okay, but I should have heeded other reviewers' warnings that it was too sweet. The flavor was very good other than the overwhelming sweetness.   I used three cucumbers.  There is plenty of dressing.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will use 1/2 the sugar.  This would really be good with some dill.

Closest I've been able to find to my Mom's and Mother in law's recipe for this dish.  My husband and two sons really enjoy this dish.  The only thing I have substituted is the sugar for another sweetener because my husband is a diabetic.

Great recipe, excellent side dish. Couple of changes: 
-Half the sauce or double the cucumbers
-Decrease the sugar from 1/3cup to 2tbsp
This recipe requires time to sit in order for the flavors to integrate; you can tell a clear difference after the first 4 hours, so this is not an optional step. Happy eating!

I used the recipe shown but next time I'll use less sugar, probably 1/4 cup because it was too sweet for me. Nonetheless, it was delicious and very easy.

This is a tad sweet as other reviewers have said but oh so very yummy. Making this for the second time and looking forward to it being just as good the second as it was the first. I am using Penzey's black pepper, which is simply the best, in this recipe.

My mom always made these and so it's a favorite.  I make them the same way as this recipe except I only use a very small amount of sugar, just to taste....like a teaspoon!  It's just a matter of taste I know...so thank you TARAWVU for sharing this :-)

I thought these were excellent. I had been trying to make this type cucumber salad on my own and it never came out quite right.  I followed the suggestions of others and cut back on the sugar a little bit and I'm glad I did, they were perfect.  I have also made them where I added scallion and that was delicious also.  A perfect recipe for a hot summer day!

ive always loved this side. my dad makes it all the time, but not living at home means i had to figure out the sour cream/vinegar ratio on my own. i always add onions, either white or red. when i was pregnant this was all i wanted.

Didn't care for the tang of the sour cream and I thought it was a little too sweet. My husband seemed to enjoy it though.

After reading the reviews I used a little less sour cream otherwise I followed the recipe.  I really thought we were going to love this but it just turned out ok -nothing I'd make again though.  Thanks anyway.

I loved eating something like this as a kid.  I added thinly sliced sweet onion to it and I think that makes the dish.  I don't think soaking the cucumbers was necessary and was a pain to dry.  I will skip that part next time.  I wish the sauce wasn't quite so watery also.

I make this with seasoned rice wine vinegar and just about a teaspoon of sugar.  I tried this one and it was a little too sweet.  I think I'm just accustomed to my families version.

This is definately different. I cut down on the sugar just a bit and to me it was still too sweet. The sauce tasted a lot like a dessert dip you would make for fruit. A little odd with cucumber (for my taste anyway). Not great, but not horrible.

Great summer side salad, I used English cucumbers and added chopped vidalia onions. It was a hit! Will definitely make this again!
