Turmeric is supposed to be so good for you, so this hot drink seemed a no-brainer for trying. I used unsweetened almond milk and after tasting, added just a teensy bit of stevia. It definitely has a kick to it with the black pepper.

A comforting and soothing drink. I actually had a jar of  'turmeric tea' on hand, a powdered blend that had all of the ingredients called for including ginger. First time trying it, too. I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk. After it was hot enough for me, I added the tea mixture plus some agave nectar to sweeten and a small amount of vanilla extract. I let it continue to warm until all was incorporated, not the full 5 min.  It seems like this would be very good chilled with ice in the warmer weather; will have to try that. Thanks for this good and healthful recipe idea!

Very good. I need to use over time and see what beneficial anti-inflammatory there may be.
