These are delicious. I served them as an appetizer at a Christmas party and everyone loved them. A few of these along with a salad would make a great light lunch.

These were great - and easy.  Instead of putting the spices in the olive oil, I put about 1 or 2 tablespoons of pesto in the olive oil and brushed that on the bread.

Mmmm soo good!  Grilled cheese and tomato is my favorite sandwich, and this is like the sexier, grown-up version :) My only stray from the recipe was using grated cheddar cheese.  Thanks!

Mmmmmm, these are so delicious! And talk about easy?! Apart from using Viennese bread, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were absolutely perfect. I think I'll be having these for lunch on a regular basis (and I'm going to experiment with different cheeses). Thanks!

My Mom used to always cook this. I attempted to make it on my own several times but failed. Finally, I can make tomato bread like Mom's!!

Served this at our family Christmas gathering.  They were gone in a flash.  Will definitely make this again.
