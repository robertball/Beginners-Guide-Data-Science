I made these as an appetizer using a larger melon baller to shape them and rolled them in seasoned bread crumbs  They were a hit of the party.

I had half a package of sun-dried tomatoes, so I just used those. They turned out perfect.  I'll be making these again.

Very good recipe.  Added some Italian spices and cooked with a Marinara sauce.  Yum!  My son keeps asking for these.  My daughter has wheat and egg allergies.  So I used wheat free bread crumbs and it came out great!

Very tasty, however, I used a lean ground beef, and there were not enough drippings to make any brown sauce, so I just stirred in some ketchup, brown sugar, mustard into the skillet after taking out the meatballs for a more traditional sauce.

Very easy! Yummy!  I made them small and they turned out very good.  Instead of the gravy I added a large can of italian stewed tomatoes and made a marinara sauce.  It was very good and I would make these again.  I have a 3 and 5 year old and they liked them too!

Now these were unbelievably good! I used this recipe for meatball sandwiches and my family just loved it. I think I will use it again to make smaller meatballs for a party appetizer. These are simply awesome. The sun-dried tomatoes really do the trick. YUMMY!!

Made this tonite for dinner with egg noodles; unfortunately storms sent my men to the farm to take care of things there, but my Mom and I loved it! Only diff was I used milk instead of water for the gravy. The sun died tomatoes have it a unique flavor. A keeper for sure!

I give the meatballs a five, but the sauce a two.  It was virtually flavorless and was in desperate need of salt and pepper.  In hindsight, I bet a little Worcestershire would have perked up the sauce a bit.  The meatballs are something I will definitely make again though, they are yummers!
