I usually just make salmon with lemon pepper or salt and pepper with olive oil, but wanted to know some great ways to prepare salmon using sesame oil. I made this salmon without the ginger (we did not have this at the house) and it still came out so well. I can only wonder how good it will taste next time when we do add the ginger. Very easy to follow instructions and short preparation time!

Just curious why it’s called grilled sesame chicken and it’s not grilled. Other than that it turned out well in the pan!

It's better to sear the meat side for only three minutes and cook the skin side for 6 or 7 minutes to make it crispy

Delicious!  Eyeballed the ingredients.  Not exact measurements.  Marinated for an hour.  Watched the salmon closely on the frying pan as each stove is different.   Turned out flavourful, moist and juicy.

Perfect, flaky fish with the timings given and, surprisingly, despite the short marinade time, just the right amount of flavor.  I was concerned as I had no ginger, that the soy would be too strong but not an issue. This will be a go to.

I love salmon and I am always looking for new recipes to try.    This was an easy marinade to get together and the flavors complimented the salmon nicely.    The salmon was perfectly moist and flaky.   I didn't realize until towards the end of cooking that I was out of sesame seeds, but, the sesame oil did give it a nice sesame taste.  I am sure it would be even better with the sesame seeds.

This was an easy to follow recipe and the salmon turned out perfectly.  I would use less soy sauce but mainly because it was a little salty for me, otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars.

I forgot the sesame seeds, but still loved the taste.  I grilled it on my gas grill, it was great!  I added Mirin (rice wine), so not sure if that did anything special to it.  I'm going to make it again with the sesame seeds.  It'll probably be even better!

The oil and marinade burned in the pan. Mine looked like some of the pictures with a black crust.   It was OK - I prefer pan baked to frying in a pan. I also beg to differ that prep is 10 minute considering I had to measure the items, mince a garlic, and grate a ginger root it took a bit more time

Wow!  This is the best salmon dish I have ever made.  While cooking it, I felt like I was in our favorite Japanese restaurant having dinner because of the aromas given off.  My only mistake was that I cooked it in a skillet on my gas cooktop.  I had a lot of burnt flavors on the bottom of the pan.   It was too hard to maintain temp and it got too hot.  Next time, I'll cook it in an electric skillet and see if that works better.  It was so delicious!

I followed the instructions. The glazed burned the salmon. I had to cut off the burned crust.
