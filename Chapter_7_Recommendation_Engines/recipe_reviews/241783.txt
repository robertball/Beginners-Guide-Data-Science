I really wanted to like this dish. I used Maple bacon, which i though would go nicely with the banana. I cooked for about 7 minutes and had to turn over to cook some more to get all sides crispy(total about 14-15 minutes)I removed them from pan and placed on a paper towel to drain off the extra grease and then transferred them to a plate. The banana was mushy,and almost weird to eat.s) Perhaps if making this serve it over top of pancakes, for a fun topping or even on a Peanut butter sandwich-it might actually taste okay like that!
