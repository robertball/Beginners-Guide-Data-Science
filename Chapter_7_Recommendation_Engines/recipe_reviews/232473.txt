This is an easy, quick dessert recipe that can bake while the main meal is being prepared. Having 2 VERY overripe bananas, I mashed them and substituted for the pineapple. It came out great!

I just soften the butter before I mix it with the sugar until it's all blended before adding the eggs, then add the drained pineapple.  As much as I love it (especially leftover and extra toasted), it always tastes best at the holidays.

Upon mixing the liquid mixture with the bread cubes, it seemed way too wet, so added 2 more slices of cubed bread. Turned out yummy! (It took an hour and 15 minutes to cook. Might just be my oven though)

I absolutely recommend this recipe, I have made something similar to this before but with more ingredients. If  you want to go the extra step with a few tweaks I recommend:
Using Hawaiian sweet bread rolls instead,
While warming up oven, toss some broken pieces of bread on a tray and toast them. This allows different texture in bread pudding. I save them to add to the top of my dessert. 
I as well used both pineapple and 2 mashed ripe bananas. 
ENJOY :)

Great recipe! I recommend this for a quick and easy dessert. I ended up using more than five slices of bread (about half a loaf) and it was still perfect!!!!!!

I have made pineapple bread pudding for Thanksgiving for the past 10 years. I couldn't find my recipe this year.  This recipe was what I remembered mine to be. I have always doubled the bread.  It didn't have the normal crisp top. I don't think I cover mine. The taste was exactly right. My family didn't know it wasn't my original recipe. We definitely make again.

I had some bread that had baked in a bread maker a little to early in the morning. So when I got home later I found it very crusty and dry on the outside so I decided to make bread pudding. Your recipe is so yummy! So simple and it made enough for me to have breakfast for the next week, thanks for the awesome recipe. =D

I have used this recipe before and it is so simple and always a hit. I just used it today - but I had 4 over ripe plums to use up... And I threw in a handful of fresh blueberries. Turned out perfect.

Never made bread pudding before, and this recipe was so easy!  It was delicious, and I'm looking forward to making this again.

I made this with some leftover brioche so I cut back on the sugar since the brioche was already sweet. I think that the people that had problems with the recipe is due to the recipe not specifying that you should drain the pineapple. I read some reviews that said they used some of the pineapple juice in the recipe which I ended up doing as well but i don't think I will next time. My cook time was about 1.5 hrs and it was still a little mushy. It tastes great though.

This is a VERY easy, bulletproof recipe, and it tastes wonderful.  I serve it both as a side (usually with ham) or as a dessert.  I add a couple more pieces of bread for a slightly lighter texture.  I mix the softened butter, sugar, pineapple and eggs until smooth before folding in the bread cubes (crusts removed).  I don't cover the dish unless I need to use a much hotter oven.  When I serve it as a side dish I reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup.  For a dessert I sometimes sprinkle a little more sugar on top during the last 20 or 30 minutes of cooking.  This is a great dish around the holidays because it can be cooked at whatever temperature the oven is set at and doesn't need to be piping hot to taste great.

This was very good even though I didn't have enough pineapple (probably only half of what was called for). Will definitely make again soon since fresh pineapple is in season.

Tasted good. I added Mango to my mix to level out the tartness of the pineapple. Still couldn't do it without his recipe

My mom also always makes this recipe for holidays!  She always serves it as a side dish but it is definitely sweet enough that it could be a dessert, and I think she only uses 3/4 c of sugar (the recipe I have says 3/4 -1 c).  I was actually looking on here to see if anyone could recommend the best kind of bread to use?  I've always just used just plain white bread but I feel like something a little more artisan could be better?  Any thoughts?
