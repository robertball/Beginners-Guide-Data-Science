I've made this a few times now and really like it! I didn't have sun dried tomatoes tonight so did what another user did and used diced tomatoes with the addition of Italian seasoning. I also added some basil. It wasn't bad at all. I think next time I want to add mushrooms and sliced onions. It's a little off course but that's what I love about this recipe. It's simple and versatile!

Super easy and quick dish that's really tasty! The fifth star is because it was sooooo fast to prepare. Only edit I made was that we did not have the julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes in  oil but made up for it by adding a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. This will definitely be a recipe I repeat.

So quick, easy, and yummy!  I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I just threw in a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  

Will definitely be making it again!

Great simple, fast, easy weeknight go to recipe. I made it once with the sausage then the next time I used chicken since that is what I had in the freezer and still tasted great!!

It's a favorite at my house.  I keep the pantry stocked with these items in case we have the craving.  I add red pepper flakes.  It would be great with a splash of dry white wine to add a little liquid.

I made it. Since I didn't have any sundried tomatoes, I used a little tomato paste and added a bit of gnocchi cooking water for the spinach to wilt faster. I prefer mine without parmiggiano but my son wanted the cheese and he raved about this dish.

My husband said at first bite that it was good so I will be making this again.   I thought the quantities were off.  It could have used more spinach and more tomatoes and less gnocchi.  This was my first experience with gnocchi and I thought it was rather filling.

Great.  I love the fork impression shown in the vid.  Makes them look cool and they do hold the sauce better.    When I did it,  I dumped  two cups of flour as per the recipe  and it was way way too much.    I had to add water.   Probably a difference in the flour or the potatoes.  In future,   I will start with 1.5 cups of flour and add more if needed.

So yummy and so easy! It took longer to boil the water for the gnocchi than all the rest. The type of sausage I’m sure dictates a lot of the flavor.I did put some fresh basil in with the spinach (just because it was sitting in the counter). Husband LOVED it and wants me to make again. Next time I might try to mix it up and use Greek sausage and feta instead of Parmesan.

great use of gnocchi. I had to substitute a bit but it was still delicious.
instead of sausage, I used smokies.
instead of tomatoes, I used classico cheese sauce.

My husband said this was a thumb's up!  After reading other's comments; I made like the recipe, but added large slices of red onion to the sausage, tomatoes, and  garlic,  chunked up zucchini, and sliced banana peppers.  I threw in about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes too.
It was very easy and delicious.
The parmesan cheese topped it off.

I made this exactly as the recipe said with the exception of dumping everything out of the pan, deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of cooking white wine, added everything back to the pan, tossed and let the liquid evaporate.  This is packed full of flavor and is quick and easy.  Great for a busy week night .  Will be making this again.

We loved it. I made it very close to the recipe. I ended up adding a little more evoo after coming the sausage mixture to the gnocchi. Otherwise all the rest was the same as the recipe. Definitely making again!

I wanted to try something different to do with gnocchi other than my favorite soup recipe and came across this gem.  I used turkey keilbasa instead of smoked sausage because that is what I had on hand.  My family adored it!  I even thought it was pretty good and I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan. Oh and I have to give credit where credit is due... SUPER easy and fast to make too!

Honestly, my boys loved this.  I threw mine out and ate soup.  It was super easy and presented well.  I won't make it again but next time I'm out and they are in charge of themselves, they will make it.

I used Chicken Apple sausage because that is what I had on hand.  It was fantastic!  No leftovers for this!  It was a hit!

Easy enough for hubby to make and picky teenager even liked it! Had pecorino cheese gnocchi which gave it an extra kick as well. Will definitely stay on favorites list!

I added some Italian Seasoning to this and it was a hit! Different way to enjoy Gnocchi besides in a soup.

Made as is...I loved it.  Making it again tonight.  My husband refused to eat the spinach and sun-dried tomatoes, his loss.  It was quick and easy too; an added bonus. A keeper!

Very easy to make and fast. It it is super flavorful. The sundried tomatoes are sweet and tangy. Could use a little more garlic for my taste or chili flakes. Needs a little kick. I will make this again for sure.

This is a quick, easy dish, bursting with flavor (almost too much flavor if that's possible). 

The jar of tomatoes has a lot of oil and makes the dish feel heavy and quite oily. Next time I will add 2 packages of Gnocchi instead of 1 to hopefully spread the oil out. I don't think changing oils would work as the tomato flavor is infused in this oil so you want to keep that and changing to a sauce would make the meal even heavier. If you skipped the oil all together there would be nothing to bind the ingredients to each other.  

Overall this was a fast and delicious meal. I will make it again with that single change.

I really liked how fast this was to whip up. I started out by cooking up some diced onions with the garlic and also added Italian seasoning and white pepper with the sausage. I thought the spinach didn't quite taste right with the rest of the ingredients, but it wasn't bad. I wonder if a different green leaf would be a better substitute here. With the oil I cooked the onions in plus the oil from the sun dried tomatoes, the dish turned out very oily.  I would pair that down a bit next time.

This was delicious, and very light and tasty.  I added red onions to this too. 
My husband and I loved it!

I loved it!  I simply added a little Italian dressing and Italian seasonings. It was very quick and easy to make. Very filling, as well!

This will not make it into our rotation however, it was definitely quick and easy.  I don't know if the leftovers will be used by us or the dogs at this point.  Not certain if it was the brand of gnocchi or the off brand of sausage that I used, but there just wasn't enough flavor for our liking.  It was worth what little effort it took to make though.
