As is, this recipe is pretty good for a basic muffin recipe. But it lacks some helpful tips in the instructions, and the ingredient list is typical. So here's how I amped it up.  I whisked the melted butter with the sour cream first, before adding the beaten eggs - this adds fluffiness to the batter. Also, you never add beaten eggs directly into warm melted butter alone, or you might get wet scrambled eggs! In recipes like this one, it's also a good idea to toss fruit with a little flour so the pieces won't sink to the bottom of muffins or bread in a glob.  To improve the taste, I added vanilla to the wet batter. I left out the cinnamon in favor of an equivalent, combined amount of the following: some allspice in the dry batter, and some cardamom, dried orange peel, and dried lemon peel in the wet. You have to experiment with these spices to find the ratio you like best, but they balance out the flavor of apples (I used granny smith) and also, alone or in combination, of pears.   I also never use plain flour for toppings - it just adds more gluten without flavor. I substitute a slightly smaller amount of crushed cinnamon graham crackers, shortbread cookies, or butter cookies, depending on the recipe and my own preferences. This strategy uses up leftovers or stale post-party remains, and generally adds more oomph to my cooking.  Hope all these hints and tips help!

YUM! My family loves this(as do I). I didn't do much to it to change it. I only added a little bit of all-spice & nutmeg, and a little more then what the recipe called for in apples- only because I have 2- 5 gallons buckets of apples. The topping is perfect- tasty & crunchy! 
I made 12 muffins, with the remaining batter I made a loaf of bread, it was kind of thin, so maybe more like coffee cake? Anyway, that was delicious as well.

Pleasantly plump apple muffin, moist, but (gratefully!) not soggy. I prepared these exactly as the recipe directs and would do so again. Nicely spiced, tender, and perfectly laced with apples.   Since neither the muffin nor the streusel was overly sweet it was nice to have a real, apple muffin rather than a little apple cake!

These muffins were so easy and yummy.  I added maple glaze on the top of the muffin after it cooled. 
Next time I make them I will probably use more cinnamon in topping.  I will also add applesauce for moisture and 1/3 butter instead of 1/4.

I cannot say enough good things about these muffins!  These are by far the BEST muffins I have ever eaten or made.  I only did one thing different...I used 2 cups of chopped apples.  My whole family loved these.  I don't think they will last long.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.  I will be making these again and again.

These were delicious!  I made them with gluten free flour and they were moist and not crumbly at all!  I baked them at 375 degrees for about 25 minutes or so.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I made these for my daughter's kindergarten class & they were a hit!  I used applesauce (2 individual serving cups) instead of diced apples.  These are great even w/o the streusel topping.

I'm giving it 5 stars. Mine came out moist and delicious, and the crumble on top was the perfect foil to the texture of the muffin. I had to make 1 creative change, just because I didn't have a whole cup of sour cream... I did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese. Pretty delicious. I agree with some of the reviews that it needed a glaze or something extra. I will probably glaze half for a more desserty muffin, and keep half plain for something more breakfasty.

These were very tasty. I added a little extra spice and in the topping I left out one tablespoon of flour. I loved the topping little bit of crunchiness on the top was nice.

Made as they are these muffins leave a lot to desire. However, they are a great base. What I did: For the batter - I doubled the apples (used Winesap), beat the sour cream and butter for several minutes, then added eggs. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp banana extract. For the dry mix: kept everything the same and added - 2 tsp of apple pie spice (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg). I then folded in my chopped apples into dry mix and then folded that mix into the wet. For topping I used cinnamon sugar and crushed graham crackers.  Baked @ 400 for first 5 mins then finished at 350. (Done in about 15 mins) Cooled for 10 mins and then drizzled cream cheese frosting on top. Super!

Very yummy! If I feel like sweetening them a little, I use vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream, and top them very generously with the streusel.

I made these for my daughter's 1st grade Valentine's Day class party.  The kids will love them, me-not so much.  They are a bit too sweet for my taste and lack depth/texture.  They were very moist and are a good beginning.  I used 2.5 granny smith apples, grating one and adding it with the eggs, butter and sour cream.  The others I chopped.  I will make these again, but with some changes:  1/2 whole wheat flour, adding some oatmeal, maybe wheat germ and chopping the apples bigger.  Thank you for sharing!

Actually, 4-1/2 would be more accurate. Lovely little treats. Nice, moist texture. I doubled the cinnamon in both the muffins and the topping, plus added several grinds of fresh nutmeg to the muffins. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with the one exception of using brown sugar in the topping in place of regular, as we love the flavor it adds in baked goods with apple. We felt it to be short on topping, and the next time, I will increase it by 50%. This recipe yielded 22 regular muffins for me, not 16, which might account for the shortage of topping. Very, very good, but because of the adjustments that needed to be made, it narrowly misses the coveted 5 star rating.

These were pretty good - although, I think they need more than just cinnamon and apples (raisins? nutmeg?). My husband's been gobbling them up though, so I can't complain! 

I used a large cookie dough scoop to put the dough in the muffin cups - it worked great! No spills/overflow, and it left room for the streusel. I got 22 muffins out of this batch.

Easy and good.  Gave these as a gift to the preschool teacher and a neighbor for Christmas.  Instead of making the streusel topping just sprinkled on cinnamon and sugar, they were very good.  Great recipe! Next time I would probably add nutmeg.

Pretty good! THey stuck to my cupcake liners a bit but overall I think they turned out pretty good!

I did substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and I did not use the streusel instead i made a maple drizzle for the top with maple syrup, powdered sugar and water. Yummy!!!

Yum! Took the advice of many reviewers, added lemon peel and orange peel, extra apple, brown sugar in part.  The teenagers ate almost all of them before I could get to them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this recipe was awesome, and my hubby and coworkers agreed!  I added a bit more cinnamon in the cake and the topping, and used 1/8 cup white sugar and 1/8 cup brown sugar for the topping.  I made this as an 8"x8" cake (plus 2 muffins for hubby) and topped with a maple glaze, as suggested by joy.  Can't go wrong...rich, dense, moist and oh so yummy!

I enjoyed these muffins though they are a tad bland.  I added some extra cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the batter.  I also subbed half brown sugar for the white sugar in the batter and used only brown sugar for the topping.

Loved these! I only had pink lady apples but I can only imagine how much better they will be if I used Granny Smith. I took the suggestion of others and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping and it was magnificent!

GREAT muffin. Used half brown sugar, half white. Tossed in about 1/2 c. raisins too. Like another reviewer said, make sure you grease your muffin pans! I got 18 regular sized muffins, and using a non stick pan, greased well with Parkay, still stuck a bit. Took mine exactly 18 min.

Good recipe, these muffins came out nice.  I made the recipe non-dairy and used the Tofutti fake sour cream and margarine.  I also added a little vanilla.  The batter was a little too thick for me to stir so I added 1-2 tablespoons of soy milk.  I have a convection oven, baked them at 390 for 20 min.

Good and the kids liked them too! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and whisked the butter with it before adding the eggs. Next time I will use apples that are more tart (the gala's that I got on sale didn't have much 'pop' to them) and improve the streusel topping to make it stick more (maybe more butter?)

Not too sweet, very moist and flavourful. I used fat free sour cream and they turned out wonderful. Also threw in a 1/2 cup of apple sauce and cut back the sugar to 1/2 a cup.  Kids loves them, my mom loved them...HUGE HIT.

Loved these!  I did toss the apple chunks with a couple tablespoons of the dry mixture so they wouldn't sink to the bottom and I added 3 oz of cinnamon chips.  The second time I did them in a 9" round cake pan, baked at 375 for about twice the time.  Worked out great.  They are rich and moist and very tasty.  Everything you'd want in a muffin or cake.  YUM

These muffins were very good. When they were done I added a drizzle of powdered sugar glaze on top. They were very moist and tender. A sure winner.

Excellent breakfast or snack muffin. I doubled the streusel and substituted light brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping for a richer result. Watch carefully in last five minutes to be sure to not over bake. Best if slightly under done.

Yummy apple muffins...I made them in mini tins and included crushed candied pecans in the topping.  Remember to let butter cool prior to adding to batter.

I wanted so badly to love these muffins because of all the positive reviews but sadly I found them quite bland - the topping was dry and certainly didn't liven them up at all. While I'm glad others loved them, I thought they were only okay, not great.

I love, love, love these muffins.  I used half wheat/white flour once when I made them and they turned out nice.  I would make just a little more of the topping!  It's so yummy.

These muffins were okay, but I felt like they could have been better. I really don't like muffins that don't pop with flavor. I felt like these didn't. However, they have a great texture and are very easy to make, so I might try again using a bit of apple sauce and maybe a pinch more cinnamon to try and liven them up. They are decent muffins, but lacking. Thanks anyway!

These are great muffins.  I did follow advice from others regarding how to mix.  I also didn't have a cup of sour cream (I only had about 1/4 cup) so I mixed my sour cream with apple sauce to make it a cup and they are super moist.  I also did not use regular flour for the topping.  I used graham cracker crumbs, cinnamon and sugar.  I will definitely be making these again!!!

These are pretty good! I shredded the apples on a cheese grater instead of chopping the apples. I have a toddler son and if he sees chunks of apples he won't eat them. Will keep this recipe, thanks!!

I made the recipe as is.  Great taste-- next time though I would use brown sugar for topping, otherwise, they will look like they're dusted with flour.  I made 12 giant muffins-- I ate one out of the oven, and I'm having a hard time stopping there! =)

Very good! The only change I would make is adding more cinnamon to the topping as well as using brown sugar instead of white. Otherwise very tasty.

Loved them. I used the apples that were on hand so they weren't the best. But the muffins were lightly sweet and moist. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! It's going in the permanent collection!!! My son proclaimed they were the best things ever.

I'm amazed! I'm one of those cooks that doesn't eat what they make because they just don't think it tastes that good.... but I ate two muffins right out of the oven! I can't believe I didn't buy these from a bakery. The only thing I did differently was add a tad bit more cinnamon and for the topping I used brown sugar in place of white sugar. Delicious!

This is possibly one of the most delicious muffins I have ever made, and I’ve made quite a few muffins in my time.  The recipe produced 18 muffins and between my husband and three 7 year olds I only had 3 muffins left.  They all gave it rave reviews.  I had one myself, and I have to say it was perfect in every way.  I did add a pinch of nutmeg.  I would recommend this recipe to any one.

I really liked this recipe. It is very thick, but bakes up nicely, so don't panic. I think next time I may use brown sugar in the topping.

These came out so good!  Really grease the bottom of the muffin tin, otherwise they are hard to get out of the pan!  I cut the apples really small so you get a bunch in every bite and the streusel topping was excellent!

Ao far the recipe is simple and easy to put together. The one thing I did do different was add 2 cups of diced apples. Waiting for the muffins to come out of the oven!

Holy cow! I can't keep these muffins in the house more than a day or two! I make regular sized muffins for us and mini-muffins for our little guy (17 months) and I'm lucky if I even get one. My fellas love these muffins, and they're so easy to make. (I get 24 mini muffins and 6 large ones out of one batch, but I fill the  mini muffin cups to the top so they're slightly larger.)

These were so moist! I used half white, half brown sugar and added vanilla, raisins and extra apples and cinnamon, plus substituted oats for the flour on the crumble topping. I also used gluten flour, which usually makes things crumbly and dense, but these turned out amazing!

We just love this recipe.  I have also used wild blue berries in place of the apples. They are easy to make and so good as a snack.  They are my first to go to recipe when making muffins.

I made mini muffins and they turned out very tasty. I did substitute about 1/6th of the flour with wholemeal flour, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for ground nutmeg, and 1/2 of the sour cream with yogurt because I did not have enough sour cream on hand.  The muffins can be filled up almost to the top as they do not rise so much. If they are filled up to the top, they have a lovely dome shape :)  Thsi recipe's a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I added 1/2 cup more apples, and made an oatmeal crisp topping. They were absolutely delicious!

Yummy! It snowed here the other day and ever since I was craving something festive :-) The only thing I changed was I used plain yogurt instead if sour cream and sprinkled a little bit of nutmeg into the batter! They are amazing, just the comfort food I've been craving! Thanks for the recipe!!

I just took these muffins out of the oven.  When I added the wet to the dry ingredients, I found the batter entirely too thick - so much so that I couldn't even stir it. I had to add about a fourth of a cup of (almond) milk to make it movable. I did toss the apples in some of the dry ingredients mixture first to prevent the apples from sinking. I found that this worked for the most part - the most apple populated part of the muffin was indeed the bottom, but there were still apples throughout the top and middle also. I also used brown sugar in place of regular sugar for the topping.  So, I found these muffins to be quite delicious. I just took them out of the oven and had a warm one - it was great.

These are absolutely the best Apple Muffins we have fixed. They were just the right sweetness and the whole family loved them.

Great recipe!  I did change a bit of it however - I used white whole wheat flour, closer to 2 cups apples, and added small amounts of ground cloves, nutmeg, and allspice to to the topping in order to create a "mulled cider" flavor to the muffin.    I doubled the recipe and the lot still didn't last more than a few days!

these muffins were good...however the streusel melted through the muffin...so i was sad there wasn't the yummy crunchy topping. maybe next time add streusel at the end while still hot enough to melt the butter.

After going through recipes, it was nice to find one that didn't have changes suggested by reviewers. These are marvelous! Even without the streusel topping.

We loved these muffins.  I substituted fat-free sour cream, used Smart Balance instead of butter, and cut the sugar a bit--and they were delicious!!

The recipe is really easy to follow. I think that they could be baked at 350 F insteas of 400 F to prevent the sugar from burning so quickly. But once the smoke cleared the survivors tasted great...lol! I look forward to trying this recipe again soon.

I had some extra Macintosh apples I wanted to use up and this recipe sounded like a great match. They were fabulous. Very moist! I will keep this one! I wonder if it could be made into a coffee cake?

These muffins were moist but not sweet enough. Either the apples I used were really tart or I need to add more sugar next time. Great consistency though!
