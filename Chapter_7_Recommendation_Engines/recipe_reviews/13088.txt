While this is a very good soup, it's not Scotch Broth.  Scotch Broth is and always has been made with Lamb, usually lamb neck bones or lamb shanks.

The soup required more seasoning than was stipulated... and i added more carrots and potatoes to thicken it up a bit.  Other than that it was good.

This ended up very tasty, with only a few changes.  I put in a little boullion when it ended up being very bland.  I think that if the bones were roasted as I have seen in other recipes, it would have worked more to my taste.  Perhaps Scotch Broth is supposed to be bland?  But the basic soup was delicious!

Without lamb, it is not Scotch Broth. This is a recipe for a Beef Barley.

Not scotch broth.  Must use lamb.  This is beef and barley soup.

Added about 3 times the peppercorns the second time I made this to help bump up the spiciness. I also added about a tsp of salt. All in all a nice, simple yet tasty soup.
