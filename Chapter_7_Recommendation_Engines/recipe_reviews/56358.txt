I have used this same recipe for two years now and it is the best.  I have not used basil or coriander with it though but I will try it next time.   Refreshing with the lemongrass and sinfully spicy.  Great recipe!

mmmmm...YUMMY!  Tastes like the Tom Yum at the Thai Restaurant that will charge you 4 bucks for a small bowl full.  I was impressed, not that difficult either.  I used low sodium canned chicken broth and substitued tofu instead of chicken and it was fantastic!

This is a yummy soup! I found a fresh frozen finely chopped lemon grass in the oriental store that I keep handy all the time. I make a big batch of this soup and freeze it in individual containers. I just pop it in the microwave every time I crave for it.

Delicious! What a great flavor. We used lime zest insetad of kaffir lime leaves (couldn't find them), and it was easy and awesome. Next time, we will cut chicken in half and add shrimp.  Probably would serve 4 as a first course easily, but 6 is a stretch. All in all, a keeper that we will make again.

Very good, tasted very much like the Tom Yum soup from our fave Thai restaurant. To make it a little more authentic, I used straw mushrooms instead of regular. Good stuff. Thanks!

I only made a couple minor changes. I thought there needed to be more "broth to chicken" ratio..I added an extra cup of water and one chicken breast instead of two.Lacking the limes leaves I also used lime zest. The poster that put it in a tea ball...that was a great idea! The one hing Ifound though is not to leave the lime zest in very long. Short time = flavor. Too long = bitter.

YUM! I used canned straw mushrooms and had to leave out the green chile (had none).  I also left out the chicken because i was making this a starter.  Had I followed this exactly it would be 6 stars. Thanks

Soooooo good! And I can't believe how fast and easy it was. This is a definite keeper for me. My changes: used zest of 1 lime (in a tea ball so I could remove) instead of kaffir lime leaves, used half the chicken per another review, and added 4 slices ginger and canned straw mushrooms to make it like my local Thair restaurant. I love the broth so next time I will keep the chicken and mushroom amounts the same but make 1 1/2 times the amount of broth. Also, I'm storing the leftovers with the cilantro (coriander) and basil kept separately so I can add it fresh with every bowl.

The recipe was pretty good and authentic.  I added some scallops when I made it.  I always prefer seafood flovor for this Thai soup.

This turned out great the first time!  Next time I'll tweak by adding more mushrooms and going a little lighter on the fresh herbs.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent soup, I've been using this recipe for a while, when to the local thai food restaurant, which tasted the same as this recipe but a little sweeter, so I added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup, now it's a 5 star. Mind you I did double the recipe, so you might want to put less. Also I put half of the chicken required, otherwise it's too much. thank for this great recipe

Easy and delicious! I always get hot & sour chicken soup from the local Thai restaurant when i have a cold- this is just as good (maybe even better) and much cheaper. YUM!

This soup was awesome!!!  I only had 1/2 the amount of  lemon grass stalks and only dried coriander leaves and it was still fantastic.  I also added some diced tomatoes to finish it off.  I would make this over and over.  Great recipe!

Very very good base, perhaps not as hot as the Thai restaurant versions I am used to.  For more heat, I add one more teaspoon of tom yum, an extra cup of stock, and two ginger slices. And put sliced chicken in stock to cook. (I also omit the greenery.)  Great soup for snoy weather.

This was very good, much like you would get at a Thai Resturant....I had to add some red pepper flakes, because it wasn't quite spicy for us.

Family all enjoyed this soup - Very easy to make after getting a couple items(tom yom paste,lemongrass & straw mushrooms) from local Asian market - The tom yum paste is great - used twice the amount recipe called for & still added sirachi sauce at table since we all like spicy - also used extra mushrooms - was even better reheated

I tried a lot of recipes before I discovered this one.  A Thai woman told me that it tastes just like the Tom Yum that she used to have in Thailand!  You can find the Tom Yum paste in Asian grocery stores.

This tastes just like the one I get in Thai restaurants. I made a vegetarian batch for my mom using vegetable broth and vegetarian fish sauce (in your asian market) and it turned out great if not better than the meat version. I didn't have to use the chiles since the tom yum paste is plenty spicy for me. I cut my lemon grass into thirds and used the back of a knife to break it and release the flavors in the soup. Next time I will try using the actual kaffir lime juice and add more things like canned baby corn, bamboo shoots, and tofu.

This "Thai Hot and Sour Soup" turned out excellent. I made my own tom yum paste from a recipe I found online since I could not find any tom yum paste without MSG (which I refuse to eat) at the Asian grocery store closest to my home. I also could not find any tom yum paste at all at the large urban supermarket near my home, which quite surprised me. Tom yum paste is easy enough to make. This soup was a real treat. I liked it even better when I stirred in some coconut milk (my own addition: not the recipe) - as good as any soup I have had in a Thai restaurant. Thank you STEVE ALDER for sharing your recipe.

This was such an amazing soup rich in unique flavors that blended harmoniously. We just couldn’t get enough! Unfortunately, I couldn’t locate some of these ingredients so I had to make some substitutions. I used equal parts lemon grass paste and omitted the kaffir leaves because I could not find these. Had issues getting my hands on some fresh coriander so I substituted 2 tsp ground coriander at the beginning of the recipe.

I pulsed my chicken into small pieces using a food processor and doubled the mushrooms for more fullness. I’m going to find all the missing ingredients next time and make this again! We are sure it’s going to be even more amazing. This is the best hot and sour recipe I’ve had yet… Thank you so much for sharing, 5 stars!

This is a super easy and quick recipe.  The only thing that might be time consuming is shopping for the Kaffir lime leaves, Tom Yum paste and Lemon Grass if you live in a rural area without access to an Asian store.  The ONLY reason I am not giving this soup 5 stars is because a traditional Tom Yum Goong soup doesn't use chicken stock which is more of a Western culture thing.  However, Steve didn't call it Tom Yum Goong soup did he?  Ok, my bad, giving it 5 stars!  Thank you for a great recipe!  (tip:  using shrimp works really well too)

Haven't tried this yet but it's one of my favourite soups and I'm always looking for easy asian soup recipes. I have a hard time finding ingredients for them though and I know I'll never find Tom yum paste. Does anyone have any ideas for easy substitutes?

I make this soup all the time.  The only thing I changed was using regular lime instead of Kaffir lime (don't know what a kaffir lime is or where to get it).  I did not put lime leaves in.  Sometimes I use lemon instead of lime and it is still very tasty.  Since lemon grass stalks are kind of a pain to deal with, I just buy the lemon grass paste and use 3 tblsp. of that.  The outcome is the same.  Enjoy!

This was the first hot and sour soup I've ever made, and it was absolutely delicious! For a total beginner the instructions could have been more clear. According to a bit of research you should cut the lemon grass into long, large pieces, but crush them a bit to release the flavour while cooking. Remove them and the lime leaf before serving! (I chopped them and left them in, and they were very tough and inedible) 

My roommate and I prefer a brothier less hearty soup, so next time I make it I will double the recipe but use the same amount of chicken and mushrooms. 

I highly recommend trying this one out! It was really good.

I love this because it’s so quick and easy and has the authentic taste of hot and sour Thai soup.  I used shrimp and red curry paste instead of Tom Yum paste (didn’t have any).  I threw in a 1/2 tablespoon of Splenda brown sugar and Serrano chiles- awesome if you like it spicy!  I accidentally posted triplicate pics- sorry about that!

I really liked this soup. I made this to the letter, except I did not add a bunch of cilantro when I saw that this had only 3 cups of stock in it. I sprinkled a little on top and used the rest for another recipe.

Amazing.  I made it with shrimp and bunapi mushrooms and it is fast, healthy, and delicious.  I double the recipe and serve it with rice as a main course for two of us.  Absolutely delicious.

It tastes pretty close to authentic Thai soup.  It looks like not enough liquid at the beginning, but it is.  Don't add more liquid or it will be disproportionate.  One thing I would change is using a different mushroom.  Some Asian mushrooms probably will taste better.

Ok,to clear up some confusion I had I about fresh coriander, and I figured others might to. The recipe call for fresh coriander which is really fresh cilantro.  In many parts of the world cilantro is called coriander, here in the US coriander is the dried seed of the cilantro plant after it flowers. Since the recipe calls for a bunch of fresh coriander it means cilantro, not the dried round coriander seeds. They have TWO different and DISTINCT flavors.  So if you use dried coriander seed instead of fresh cilantro your soup will have a different flavor. I haven't made this soup yet but I will.  Hope this helps clear up some confusion. UPDATE:  Made this soup increased the broth to 8 cups and doubled the rest of the ingredients, used 1 1/2 lbs. shrimp in place of the chicken.  It is delicious!  I will be making this again and again.

Very good!  Spicy but not too hot.  I would use one chicken breast next time as there isn't a lot of broth.  I used low sodium chicken broth instead of chicken stock.

This soup was amazing. And really easy to make. It tasted just like the hot and sour soup from our favourite Thai restaurant. I made it for friends and everyone loved it. I used tofu instead of chicken and it worked really well. I also could  not find tom yum paste or keffir lime leaves so I used hot sauce and lime juice.
