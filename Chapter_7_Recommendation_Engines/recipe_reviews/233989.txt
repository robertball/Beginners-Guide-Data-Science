This is a great recipe, however I did make changes. I used about 3 T of Penzey's taco seasoning instead of the McCormick mix. I also added 1/2 T chicken base to the milk and left out the chiles. I cut the pepper and onion into small pieces and put a little bit of cheese in each tortilla. I covered the pan with aluminum foil for the first half hour. Then I took it off for the last 10 minutes. I'm sure this recipe is good as written, but I had to modify it with what I had. I will definitely make it again!

Himself has been looking for enchiladas like his mom used to make. This recipe is better than his mom's apparently. Only changes i made: 1.added two crushed cloves of garlic to the oil before i browned the chicken because garlic don't need no reason 2. I added a garden fresh jalape√±o to the green peppers and onion. He loved it. I loved it. I will make this again

This is really good.  The first time I didn't have green chilies to put in it so the flavor wasn't really there, but the second time I did add the green chilies and it made all the difference :).  Wonderful recipe!

It was ok. My husband liked it more than I did.  I followed the recipe exactly. I was just expecting more sour cream flavor than this recipe delivered and the tortillas came out very soggy.
