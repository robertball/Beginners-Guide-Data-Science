You people that write reviews and say, "it was SO good" BUT I CHANGED/ADDED a few things...You are ridiculous! YOU Change the recipe and ultimately change the rating of the recipe based off your NEW recipe.  My kids/husband didn't like this recipe (followed precisely as it is written). You should rate the recipe AS IS and not based off the things YOU add to it and change to it.

The idea of cream of celery with chicken is a great idea.  However, I changed the recipe a bit since I am only cooking for 2.  With 2 large chicken breasts (about 1/2 lb each),I used 1/4 teaspoon of paprika, celery salt, and ground black pepper.  1 tablespoon of fresh Lemon juice over the meat after sprinkling with the dry ingredients.  I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and just used 1 can  of cream of celery with 1/4 can of reduced fat milk and 1/3 cup of white wine.  The whole thing sat in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  It came out tasting wonderful.  =)  Thank you for the great recipe.

This was a good basic recipe for us.  I washed and dried the chicken breast the night before.  In a bowl I mixed 2 tbsp. of fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp. of paprika, 1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper.  I then brushed the breast with mixture, put in a zip lock bag added remaining mixture to bag which wasn't much.  Put in fridge.  I diced up some fresh celery and onion and put in a seperate bag.  Next morning I put chicken in crockpot, mixed together my fresh celery/onion with one can of cream of mushroom soup 99% fat free and in place of sherry used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and half cup of grated parmesen cheese. Poured over chicken and dinner was ready when we got home.  Served with brown rice and a salad.  Simple comfort food.  Thank you so much for the post.

My family really loves this.  I use 6 breasts, the same soup/seasoning/sherry combo.  I only cook it for 5-6 hours on low.  I take two forks and shred the chicken after about 5 hours, then stir in 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1/4 cup flour for the last hour of cooking.  The sherry makes the flavor difference.

Like so many others, I thought this was salty even though I omitted the celery salt. I used low-sodium soups so I think it might have been the cheap cooking sherry I used. When will I learn never to use a wine bought in the condiment section of the grocery store! ;o) While it was a little salty, it was still pretty good. I also used thin chicken breasts & thought they were a little overcooked; I only cooked them on low for about 6 hrs... maybe it was because I only used four breasts?  I added some chopped mushroooms & celery because I had some on hand, then I added 3 cloves of minced garlic because I love garlic. The garlic did complement the flavors of the sauce a lot. I added a little more than 1/2 c. of low sodium chicken broth to the sauce about halway through the cooking..,.I guess it needed it because of the lack of juices from the missing chicken. I did not add the parmesan to the crockpot (so I can't blame the saltiness of the sauce on that). Instead, after it had cooked, I transfered the chicken to a glass baking dish & sprinkled them w/ the parmesan & put them under the broiler until the cheese was melted & golden. Then I poured the sauce around the chicken, being careful not to pour it on the chicken, thereby maintaining my beautiful cheese topping. I served it w/ boiled new potatoes (really good w/ the sauce) & pan-fried asparagus (from this site). All in all a very good meal but it will better the next time I make it w/ a quality sherry.

This recipe gets points for ease but what it offers in convenience it lacks in flavor. To make it appealing to my family I had to add more ingrediants than the original recipe called for. The whole family liked it but only after I had altered the recipe so it barely resembled the original.
 I added more spices, spinach, garlic, shredded carrots, plus I doubled the sherry. 
 Good thing I started preparing this early.
This is a solid base for a more detailed dish but in my opinion, it doesn't stand on it's own. I'm sorry, thank you anyway.

A good easy weeknight meal.  I halved the recipe and used only one can of mushroom soup, and eight frozen chicken tenderloin pieces.  I put the chicken into the pot frozen, and when I stirred in the sauce, it looked like it would not be wet enough, but by dinner time (about 9 hours later) plenty of sauce had developed to serve over rice.  Thanks for this recipe.

This chicken recipe was soooo easy and tasted delicious. Just fix it and forget it until dinner time. What could be easier. I loved the hint of sherry in this one. I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans, and Great Garlic Knots from this site.My family loved it.

I made this with cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery, wine instead of sherry, added mushrooms, and omitted the celery salt.  It was quick, easy and really delicious - we had it over egg noodles.

Nothing to write home about.  Perhaps if I'd used the full fat soups my review would be different but because the sodium and fat contents of Campbell's soups are soups are so high I refuse to use them.  Using their low fat/low sodium soups results in a not so flavorful dish.  I think there must be a misprint as I cannot see how this sauce can accommodate 10 chicken breasts!  Any way, I won't make this again.

I used 3 chicken breasts, seasoned with lemon juice and seasoned salt, then mixed a can of cream of mushroom, diced celery, chicken broth and parmesan together and used this to cover the chicken.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours and it was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

Great base...needed a little doctoring up.  So a big pet peeve of mine is when someone totally changes the recipe and then gives it a bad review.  I made the recipe as is, came home and tasted it and then made changes.  Add apx 1 T of its better than boulion chicken base.  It makes a huge difference.  Then I shredded the chicken, and made a corn starch slurry using 2 T cream for the liquid.  I then added 1/4 cup light sour cream.  This now tastes awesome.  So I am giving the base recipe 3 stars, but the doctored up one gets 5!

Although I thought this recipe was a good base, I took the advice of some other reviewers and modified it slightly.  I used 4 chicken breasts, subbed cream of broccoli for celery soup, and also added 2 garlic cloves and chopped onion.  About 30 minutes before time to eat I tossed in the parm and a bag of frozen broccoli.  I think adding a veg to the gravy made it more of a meal, served over white rice and with a side salad.  It was really delicious, definitely will have it again. Sooo EASY! I thought the lemon juice and sherry added to the flavors of the sauce, made this recipe stand out from every other chicken w/ creamed soup recipe!

I've been using this recipe for a couple years and am just getting around to reviewing it! Sorry! We make this at least once a month, it's a total favorite. When you're in the mood for a savory, melt in your mouth meal, this is it. It smells soooo good when you walk in the door, too! Love it! Thanks so much!

I must admit this is one of my all-time favorite crockpot recipes - I have it memorized!  I place frozen chicken breasts in the removable part of my crockpot, mix all the ingredients together to make the sauce, and then pour the sauce over the chicken.  It is easy to throw together the night before, and the chicken breasts thaw overnight in the refrigerator.  In the morning, just pop it in the base and you're good to go.  I serve it with mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I made this for dinner last night, needing an easy recipe that I could just forget about since I had a lot to do and wouldn't have much time to spend on cooking. I read through some of the reviews before actually making this, and ended up tweaking the recipe using some of the tips I read on here. I only had 3 chicken breasts, and rubbed them with a mixture of 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp paprika. Put them in the crockpot and sprinkled with 1 tbsp of lemon juice. For the sauce I mixed one can cream of mushroom with one can cream of celery and 1/2 cup white wine. Poured it over the chicken and topped with about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and a handful of mozzarella. Then cooked it on low for about 6 hours. Right before serving, I shredded the chicken and just mixed it all with the sauce. Served it with butter and herb rice and it was delicious! My husband even got seconds which rarely happens. Will definitely be making this again!!!

This was a really easy meal to make for dinner and the whole family (including my six year-old) enjoyed it. I didn't have celery salt, so I used some celery seed instead and I cooked it for about five hours on low, served over rice. I also only used five chicken breasts. Great recipe!

This is very flavorful.  I added fresh mushrooms to the recipe and when it was done, I mixed in some spinach.  We ate it over noodles.  Easy and delicious.

A five star recipe with some modifications.  First, I went with two cans of cream of mushroom, as I don't like cream of celery.  Then, add a touch of dill weed, a spring of rosemary, some cayanne pepper if you like to spice things up like I do, and as much garlic as you so choose.  It came out much more flavorful than the soup mix alone.  You gotta spice it up a little and you'll have a new flavor-craze.

This was oh so good and easy!  I used sherry cooking wine, all I had, and forgot the parm. cheese.  I used 4 chicken breast but didn't decrease the sauce, since we like alot of sauce.  Will make again with the cheese.

Made exact the same way as Cooking 101 suggested except used 1tbsp sherry and the rest chicken broth & only had cream of mushroom soup.  I made 3 breasts with the amount of sauce for 5 and after 8 1/2 hrs on low chicken came out very moist & tender & falling apart BUT just didn't pack a flavor punch.  Probably won't make again.

I used 8 chicken breasts, and added 2 cups of mushrooms for the last hour. For both soups I used the 98% fat free variety. I followed others advice here and did not add celery or table salt, which I am glad I did not as we thought it was on the cusp of being too salty. It seemed too thick towards the end so I thinned it with approx. 1 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine. We served this over couscous (hubby's favorite) and served with a tossed salad. The most delicious "Quick & Easy" recipe I have tried in a long time!

great flavor, but did a few changes.  Put half the chicken but same amount of spices and liquids, except increase sherry and cheese to 1 cup each.  I also added some veggies as recommended by other reviewers and shredded the chicken.

This is amazing!  Made mashed potatoes to go with it.  Add rolls and that's ALL you need!  I could eat just the gravy with the potatoes - yummmo!  The gravy would also be amazing on pork chops.

I found this recipe on this site a couple of years ago and have made it several times but never got around to rating it.  It is just what the name says.  "Delicious".  I followed the recipe exactly and it's great, but sometimes if I don't have the right soups I have substituted cream of mushroom for one or the other.  I don't think it matters a lot, just get 2 creamed soups in there.  I haven't tried cream of broccoli but I think I will next time.  I fixed it for my daughter and her family when they came over once and now she is always asking, are you going to make that chicken again?  It was so good.

My whole family loved this dish, so it's a keeper!  I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs ('cause that's what I had) that were still frozen when I plunked them in the crock-pot.  I did follow the recipe as far as using the soups, but added a couple shakes of Fine Herbes and some fresh garlic and a shake or two of red pepper flakes.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to remove the chicken at the end and broil it with the parmesean and that was delightful!  I boiled some penne (because that's what I had), mixed it with the sauce that I defatted, and placed two or three chicken thighs on top for each serving.  The chicken was so tender! Next time I will use boneless, skinless breasts, but it's good to know that I acheieved delicious results with frozen chicken thighs.  I might even add the white wine or sherry (I used sherry this time) at the last hour because I like the taste, and I couldn't quite taste it this time, however, it was still delicious. I also might add some cream and/or cornstarch to thicken the sauce before serving (once it's done cooking)  Thank you for sharing.

This was so easy to make!  I made it for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time I'll use real sherry though.  All I had on hand was cooking sherry.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of celery.  Served it with basmati rice.

I typically don't try recipes that include canned soup (I prefer to know exactly what's included!) but this one was so well received and reviewed I thought I should try.  The wine and the lemon fancy this up quite a bit, and the family was shocked that 1) it included canned soup and 2) it was a slow-cooker dinner!  The first time made as it's given in the recipe, last night I took the chicken out of the pot after it was cooked, lined the breasts up like soldiers in a broiler-proof pan, put swiss cheese on top, and stuck it under the flame.  Oh my.....delicious indeed!  Paired it on the plate with rice and ladled the sauce over both.  I sprinkled fresh parsley on top because this recipe deserved to be dressed!   Thanks for the recipe!

This was so simple to make!  The flavor is fantastic buy mild enough (with the sherry) for the kids to enjoy!  Will definately be making this again, and again, and again!  Oh, we did add mushrooms to the top of the pile at the beginning and stirred them in hours later and they were great!

as other reviewers have written, this is not terribly flavorful, but I'm sure you can tweak it up a notch with additional spices. I only had 5 chicken breasts, so only used the one can of celery soup (no mushroom) and all remaining ingredients; just enough good sauce to cover the brown rice I made to go with it!

I've been making this for many years and its fabulous.  I find the chicken holds together better if you lightly flour, season and brown first.  Then I throw the soups, seasoning and sherry into the pan and deglaze it.  I've also thrown in various vegetables to make it a one pot meal.  Baby button mushrooms and pearl onions are the best.  Thanks for passing this recipe on!

It was very good! My Boyfriend works days while I work over the dinner hour and it was the perfect dish for him to come home too. After all the night before my tall skinny boyfriend has decided to eat whole pizza by himself so I decided he needed something alittle bit more healthy. When he came home he said the whole house just smelled so warm and comforting. I didn't measure any of the ingredients just kinda eyed what i thought looked good.  It turned out AWESOME!

This is a favorite for both of my daughters.  They just love to eat the sauce with white rice, so I double everything but the chicken breasts, which I cut back to only 4.  I also only cook it on low for 6 hours to be sure the chicken doesn't dry out.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I've had!  I did not have sherry but had some white wine on hand so I used that instead and I only had 6 chicken breasts but in a pinch that had to do. So I tossed everything in the slow cooker and when I came home, I had a fabulous dinner waiting. I will make this one of my regular dishes.

My family did not like this. I omitted the salt as suggested by others and I added a little more sherry than called for and it was just bland. The texture of the chicken was great. I cooked 3 boneless chicken breasts on low for 5 hrs. It just is lacking something, onions might have been nice. Needs more spice.

I am giving this 5 stars for ease, and 3 for taste. It was nothing extraordinary in the taste department (although it was good), but it was unbelievably easy & fast! I used cream of chicken, not cream of celery, and omitted the celery salt because I hate celery. I also added a bit more cheese and used thighs instead of breast, dark meat is my preference. Fabulous if you are short on time, and need supper ready when you get home! I will probably make this again.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious.  I only put in 6 chicken breast halves so that there would be plenty of sauce and it was perfect.  The meat was so tender and the sauce was tasty.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is so easy! Just fix some rice to go with it, and it is so good. I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, I think it turned out better with these, because they are not so big. The chicken just fell apart, so good. I did not have any celery salt, so I used garlic salt. It turned out good. And for all those weight watchers out there, it is pretty low in points!

I forgot to thaw the chicken breasts, so I put them in frozen.  Didn't have the mushroom and celery soups so we used cream of broccoli, white wine instead of the sherry and still turned out very tender and full of flavor!

This was pretty good, but too much on the celery. Next time I think I'd omit the cream of celery soup and substitute cream of chicken.

This 'exact' recipe was given to me YEARS (80's) ago....and I then made it in my new Rival crock pot!  Whenever my husband and I went out for an entire afternoon, this was such a welcoming dinner to come home to.   Back in them thar days, we didn't have, like now,  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, because what was on hand was skin on,  bone in.  Over the years, somehow, those old bone-in, skin on chicken breasts seemed to hold up better to the low, long heat and came through a tad better on the flavor.  BTW...a "must" have, is the sherry.  It adds a depth of flavor that you can really taste.

Cutting down on salt?  in place of using celery salt...use celery flakes.  Use low sodium soups.
I also use garlic or onion powder when recipes call for the salt versions.

I thought this turned out very dry...should have doubled the sauce.  it kinda reminded me of tuna casserole...on the other hand it wasn't that bad.

The chicken comes out tender and tasty.  I need to add something to it or, to me, it is just another chicken in cream of mushroom soup.   Play around with it to make it unique.

Recipe as is, is kind of blah. I added a chopped onion and some mushrooms. I skipped the cream of celery soup and used a whole can of cream of mushroom. Also, I added about 1 - 2 cups of heavy cream and this MADE the recipe. First time I made it with my alterations, second time I didn't have the cream and the chicken felt sticky in my mouth, and my husband said it was just like I made real chicken broth because of the texture of the chicken. ADD Cream, and some chopped veggies and serve over a bed of rice pasta, and it's to die for!

The name of this recipe says it all - it is truly delicious!  I didn't change a thing and I cooked it on low for ten hours.  I meant to add mushrooms about an hour before serving, but I got busy working in my flower beds and forgot!  I will add them next time. My guys LOVED this.  Served it over rice and with steamed vegetables.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I tried this with boneless skinless chicken thighs and it seemed a little over-cooked.  Probably will try again with chicken breasts as recommended.

This dish was delicious. I did make a few changes from the original - I added sliced mushrooms - and I cut the chicken breasts up into pieces. The next time I make this (and I will definitely make it again) I will not add salt - it was just a little too salty - but even then my whole family loved it!!!!!!!!!!

This was the first recipe that I tried in my new crock pot and it lived up to it's name! I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the chicken was so moist it just fell apart. I served it over chicken flavored rice and my husband ate every last bite. I will make this one again. So easy!

This was excellent--I cut my chicken into big chunks before cooking (about 2 ") and then served the finished product over egg noodles.  My company loved it too, everyone took seconds, and asked for the recipe.  YUM!!

Very good recipe.  I used chicken legs and it turned great.  The people who did not find this recipe flavourful may not have used the exact ingredients which I can see would make a difference.  The chicken must be seasoned generously with kosher salt, and freshly ground pepper.  You must use sherry not anything else as it may not give out the same flavour, and most important of all, use freshly grated "Parmigiano Reggiano" otherwise the dish will be not quite as flavouful as it should be.

Easy to make! I cut back on the recipe and only used 3 breasts and 1 can of soup. I also added mushrooms. I then made rice and put chicken on top and poured the soup and mushrooms over that. Wonderful and easy.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe, it tend to ignore the spice measurements and just go with what looks good, and you can use bottled 'real lemon' lemon juice instead of fresh (2-3 good squirts does it). I also don't salt/pepper anything when I cook...I added extra of the other seasonings and it was wonderful. If you have tried and like 'Anne's Chicken' you'll love this lower fat version that tastes similar!!

I made this recipe almost exactly as indicated, and it was easy. I used 6 lg chicken breasts & 4 thighs because it's what I had on hand. This was delicious! I let it simmer for 6 hrs on low heat, then cranked it up for an hour on high when I got home. 

After tasting I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder since some users suggested it, but it wasn't necessary. I'm not sure how some peoples ended up dry (maybe over cooking, especially on high with breasts) but mine was very moist. I didn't think the salt was overpowering either, just don't add too much 'to taste' because the cream soups have plenty. 

I served it over fresh basmati rice which soaked up all the extra juice. I will absolutely make this again.

The kids really like this.  I used frozen chicken breasts right from the freezer (does not even take longer to cook) so I didn't brown them or season them.  I put all the seasonings with the soup mixture and used less chicken than it called for because I basically just threw my chicken into the crockpot until I ran out of room.  Since it was so saucy at the end, I cooked egg noodles very al dente and added them to the crockpot to finish there.  I did this after the crockpot was off.  They soaked up much of the sauce and was very tasty that way.

This just did not taste good to us. The chicken came out moist but the flavor was not good. My husband asked me if my chicken tasted like tuna. It sort of did! The sauce was much thinner than I imagined and we did not care for the flavor of it. I had to promise to never make it again.

Tasty and forgiving recipe. I threw five frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot and followed the rest of the recipe as written, until I realized I was out of sherry. I used some marsala wine instead, figuring that was close enough. I'm sure the taste is different, but it's still great. I also put in about 2 cups of mushrooms and next time might chop up some celery as well. I cooked it on high for about six hours and served with egg noodles. This is easy and delicious comfort food. Thanks!

Followed the recipe,minus the celery salt & added carrots,cubed potatoes & mushrooms. My Hubby & I didnt care for it. We thought it 'lacked' taste. However, having to add a handful of fresh parm cheese per dish made a difference. So w/o the parm cheese we thought it was very bland. Thk you tho,for the recipe & various reviews that I typically scan while making a decision on what's for dinner.

Very good!  I used fat free cream soups and sub'd 2% for the sherry.  I also only used 6 chicken breasts.  If 12 breasts were used, there would be no gravy and that's the best part!  Served with rice and a salad.

Used 1/2 can chicken broth, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, cut two stalks celery, half an onion, and 7 cubed potatoes...it was great! Cooked on low for 10 hours.

Like a lot of reviews said, I used already seasoned cream of chicken soup but I used 2 cans for 4 chicken breasts.  I used about a can of water mixed in and cooked for 10 hrs. on low.  Towards the end I added shitaki mushrooms and a splash of fat free half and half!  My husband didn't even know it was made in a slow cooker, it was moist and delicious.  My only change next time will be to use low-sodium soup and add my own spices.  It might take a few more minutes to prep but will be better overall.

what to say about something that was about as ordinary as canned soup! It was easy to make, like everything else you place in a slow-cooker, but lacked the bite and flavor I expected from a slow cooked meal.

This was delicious! I altered the recipe to what I had on hand. I used 3 b/s chicken breasts. I squeezed bottled lemon juice over each one and sprinkled liberally with salt, pepper, onion powder (didn't have celery salt) and hungarian paprika. I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom and omitted the sherry substituting water, I then sprinkled each breast with shredded parmesan cheese and parsley. I cooked on high 5 hours and during the last hour I added a box of frozen steam fresh asparagus that I precooked for 3 minutes in the microwave. It really made the dish pretty and delicious. I made Rice-A- Roni parmesan and herb rice and served the chicken breast over the rice with lots of the gravy. The chicken was fork tender and very moist! There was just enough for 2 adults a 2yr old and 3 yr old. I will definitely make this again! The kids loved it!

This recipe seemed to be lacking something. Because it was so easy, we will probably try it again, but we'll have to play with it to get it so that it's great.

I had made a recipe almost the same as this several years ago and have been trying to replicate.  This is so easy and so delicious.  I used half the chicken and same amount of liquids so I have enough gravy to serve the chicken with rice.  My favorite!

WONDERFUL! I've never cooked with wine before, always substituted chicken broth, but the wine made all the difference. I baked this at 350 for about an hour and 15 min and served over egg noodles. The chicked was SO tender and the sauce perfect. I used 5 chicken breasts but kept the sauce recipe as is. A keeper!!

Easy recipe and Husband loved this.  Gourmet touch with the Sherry and Cheese.  Must remove skin and pat dry chicken to avoid thinning the sauce.  Must use good quality dry sherry and fresh intense flavored cheese.  No added salt needed.

I read other reviews, and decided to be lazy and throw everything in the crock-pot at once.  I used low-fat cream cheese and low-fat dressing, and I stirred the sauce 1/2 way through cooking time.  I would use a little less dressing next time, but otherwise THIS WAS A BIG HIT with everyone!  I loved it!  and sooooo easy!  Thanks so much!

Maybe it was because I used reduced fat cream of chicken/celery soup, but I thought this was really bland.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was really good.  I used seven chicken breasts and that seemed fine, especially since we love extra sauce.  I didn't have sherry so I used wine.  Next time I would like to try it with the sherry, but I will definitely make it again either way.  I will use the celery salt again, but no extra salt; I just don't think it needed it.  We had ours on hard rolls because my husband loves chicken sandwiches, and they were sooo good.  It was a winner with us.  Thanks Corwynn!

This was so easy and yummy.  I had company foe dinner and movies last week, and I threw this together before work and let it cook all day.  When I got home, I stirred it up, made some basmati rice and a green salad, and presto!  Everyone raved over it all night!

Good, but to me not great. My husband rated it higher than I did, so possibly my allergies just kept me from fully enjoying?? This was simple to make and will keep in my favorites for sure.

I have to agree with Julian.  I go to these reviews based on the high review rating only to find it's not the same recipe after all the changes are made.  Please reviewers......start rating on how the recipe is BEFORE the changes.  Submit your own recipe with the changes you make as a new recipe.  And no, I have not tried this recipe.  I got too discouraged with all the changes to it.

We love this recipe! Delicious as written, but very easy to change the flavor with different soup combinations and cheeses. I've added mushrooms, onions, or celery and it has come out tasting great each time. Thank you!

I made as written and slow cooked 8 hours  .I gave it 3 stars for ease of prep and good sauce that comes out of it but the chicken was dry.I never have had anything come out dry before in the crock pot and did not expect this. I don't think I would make this again, there are too many recipes out there to try!

I thought the chicken was dry but that might have been that someone else turned the crockpot on warm after the chicken was cooked.

Overall, for my personal taste, it was lacking in flavour. Also, four cans of soup was way too much liquid! The meat was very tender, but I would probably brown the meat first if I tried this recipe again.

We just made it, it turned out pretty good. i followed angila's review directions due to there are only 2 of us and the adjustment for 2 servings calculator was ridiculous measurements...I did not use the cream of celery since that would have been too much sauce..I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and about 1/4 cup of low fat milk and mixed it with a 1/3 cup of real sherry..the store/kitchen  stuff is nasty...I put in 2 large chicken breasts,  put the spices on them as angila recommended (1/4 teaspoon of hot Hungarian paprika, celery salt, and ground black pepper. 1 tablespoon of fresh Lemon juice over the meat after sprinkling with the dry ingredients.) i sprinkled parmesan over enough to cover the breasts,  poured the sauce mixture over top of them .i slow cooked on low for around 4 hrs..they were fine, i served with whole wheat pasta and poured some of the sauce over the breasts and the spaghetti...i thought it was enjoyable with the cream and sherry flavor and the hot paprika gave it a kick which i liked..my boyfriend liked it also and said he would definitely eat it again.

Use bone-in chicken pieces and bake instead of crockpot to get a nice Parmesan crust.

This was more like Chicken OK to us. It looked like from the spices on top it was going to be really flavorful, but was a little bland. It really needed extra parmesan cheese sprinkled on top after cooking to add enough flavor. Chicken was moist and tender after cooking on low for 7 hours. Good for a quick weeknight dinner, but would definitely add more pepper and probably some cayenne pepper or other spices as well next time. May make again, but only if looking for easy crock pot meals...not on regular rotation. Just made it again, and  forgot to add the additional spices I mentioned before. Would definitely say it is not "delicious" as is. I reduced my 3-star rating after making again, as I don't know if it's really worthy of the full 3.

the flavour was super yummy, but the chicken was a little dry. I don't think that it needs to cook as long as the recipe suggests.

For as QUICK & EASY as this dish was... it had fantastic flavor & will DEFINITELY be done again. My husband loved it. Think it's the wine (I just used a cheap white) that made the flavors really come out. We also cut the recepie to fit 2 small chicen breast for us... great great recepie!

Made this recipe per instructions with the exception of adding diced onion and celery (and yes, I used good sherry, not grocery store sherry). Found it to be bland. Added dried pepper flakes which helped but ultimately  my family did not like this recipe. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't "delicious". Will not make again.

good but not enough taste so I added some dill, 1/4 cup more sherry, chopped garlic,  1/8 cup capers, and some rosemary.  the herbs gave it a richer taste and the capers gave it a twang. I cooked egg noodles and ladeled chicken and sauce over noodles.  Made a great dinner and will be a remake with my additions.

I thought this dish WAS delicious and so did my husband.  The only thing I changed was that I used boneless chicken thighs (8) instead of the chicken breasts-just personal preference.  I think it would taste great with the addition of some sauteed onion, celery and mushrooms.  Served it over brown rice with a salad.  Couldn't be easier!

I've always wondered about all the 4-5 stars given a recipe. This one was just ordinary; nothing special. The classic dump mushroom/celery soup over chicken in a crockpot and serve over rice. I had hoped the slightly unusual ingredients would have a made a difference. It didn't! This is the same boring cream of mushroom chicken crockpot dinner!

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.  It was very easy to prepare, the chicken was pretty tender, but the flavor lacked something.  I don't know what else it needed...I will play around w/ it (add some garlic & some other seasonings) next time I make it and see what I can add.  I did use cream of mushroom and cream of chkn (didn't have cream of celery) and added some mushrooms.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  I used 6 (not 10) chicken breasts and there was plenty of sauce.

I made this for Sunday lunch, setting it on  low at around 7 a.m. and it was ready at 1 p.m.  I only used 3 chicken breasts with the same amount of soup so this wouldn't have been enough sauce with the full amount of chicken.  Very good flavor and my whole family (3 children) loved it!

Definitely not chicken delicious. The comments around the dinner table were more like "chicken ok" and "chicken alright". Kinda salty (even though I didn't add the celery salt) and I like salty things. Just nothing special at all. Very easy to put together. Might be better with Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Celery. Maybe milk instead of the sherry. And dark meat chicken instead of chicken breasts. I'm not going to bother trying again though.

Our first meal from allrecipes.com, and we picked a winner.  Easy to prepare and not very inexpensive to make.  We added some potatoes and carrots to get our vegetables.  It was so good that our 8 year old son loved it and wanted seconds, which is unusual.

I have been making this for years, since I was a beginner cook.  My husband loves it, but that's probably because it's so salty.  I use only one kind of salt (usually the celery salt), and sub low-sodium chicken broth for the sherry, because the sherry kind of gives it a throw-up taste, and cheap sherry can be salty.  Otherwise, it's decent and easy and we have it when we have a busy day planned.

Outstanding!  We are in the middle of a kitchen remodel and I'm looking for quick easy meals.  This was quick and delicious.  I could not find the paprika, so, I put in some garlic powder instead.

I will probably make this again, it is very easy. But next time I will probably add more seasoning to the chicken - we thought the chicken was a little on the bland side.

This was pretty darn good for a slow cooker/canned soup recipe. I realized that I wasn't going to be able to make what I had planned for dinner, so had to look for a recipe I could cook in the slow cooker. I used low sodium soups and Spanish smoked paprika.  My daughter thought it was bland, but I think she just likes more salt than I do.  I served this with rotini whole grain pasta, baby carrots and broccoli, and I would make this again. The sauce is a bit thin, so I might thicken it next time.

This recipe had mixed reviews, but I gave it a try and it was AMAZING! Followed everything exact, except I didn't have wine or sherry, so I put water, which I was worried would ruin it.  It came out GREAT! I used 8 large chicken breasts and cooked it for 10 hours on Low.  Served it over rice with french cut green beans and crescent rolls. DELISH!

The name says it all.  This was a simple and delicious meal.  Since there are only 2 of us, I used 4 small boneless breasts and only a can of cream of celery soup.  I followed the rest of the recipe as listed.  This was great served with a salad and over hot buttered noodles.  My husband raved and is asking to have it again.

definitly one of our favorite chicken dishes. after my husband and i got married in june of 05, i went recipe shopping online and came across this. it's now what i make when we have friends over for dinner. and we like it best with rice. i dont eat celery stuff so just use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and usually will add extra sherry (a little extra alcohol is always good, right) anyone i serve this to loves it, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy but tasted like dinner from a restaurant.  We poured the chicken and sauce over noodles which made it taste similar to alfredo.  Next time I'm going to try adding mushrooms and other vegetables with the pasta.

This was so good!  I added chopped onion and garlic and omitted the parmesan since I didn't have any.  I only cooked 4 chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was perfect so, if cooking for 12, I would triple the sauce ingredients.  Served it over mashed potatoes, yummy!  My fiance loved it and he's picky about new recipes.  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

This is really good.  I used 2 cans Campbell cream of mushroom soup, used dry herbs since I didn't have any fresh at hand and about 1/2 hour near the end, added 1/2 c cream and about the same of added parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

Very good dish. Quick & tasty. I noticed that other raters said it was salty so I omitted the celery salt and some of the cooking sherry. However, I found it to need more salt! So next time I will try it with the celery salt. Very creamy sauce, tender chicken and very easy. Definitely a keeper! Rice or egg noodles are a great compliment.

As other posters said "too salty!" i ended up adding half and half and brown sugar to decrease saltiness (which probably negated the fat free soups i used-98% ff cream of mushroom and cream of celery) I usually make this with just cream of chicken soup or cream of mushroom. I wouldn't cook with cream of celery again! chicken was VERY tender which was the main plus. I'll go back to doing it my way.

I used the 98% fat free soups, and took the advice here about not adding any salt... I think I used too much parm cheese for my husband's (I'm a vegetarian, made it for him) taste, however... BUT the chicken was sooooo tender. The sauce was a tiny bit weird but the chicken was wonderful, he said.

The chicken was wonderful and very tender.  However, the cooking wine taste was a little too strong.  I would probably use a little less wine next time.  I served it with rice and veggies and it was a good mix.  Will make again with less wine.

The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful, but as other reviwers have noted, the sauce was too salty even though I'd skipped the celery salt.  I suspect that most of the saltiness was due to the parmesan, which had disappeared into the sauce during cooking.

I halved the number of chicken breasts but made the full quantity of sauce and cooked the dish on low for 7 hours.  At that point, the chicken was cooked but the sauce was extremely salty, so I removed the chicken, added 1/3 cup of white wine and 1/3 cup of milk to thin it (didn't have any cream or half & half to hand), and 6oz of sliced white mushrooms.  After stirring the sauce, I replaced the chicken and cooked it on low for a further half hour.  The modified sauce was creamy and tasty without being too salty.

I'll make this recipe again, but next time I'll omit both the celery salt and the parmesan, and add the extra 1/3 cup of white wine from the start.

Me and my fiance loved it, it made the whole house smell good.  I added a bit of garlic.  I had no white wine or white grape juice, I freaked out and was scared the recippe would be a disaster but it was great, I am going to make it again and add white wine.  It was tender and juicy.  It fell apart and that is how we like it.  Thanks for the great recipe, i will be making this keeper again!

I'm giving this 3 stars because I liked it, but my husband did not.  I made it by mixing all ingredients first and then pouring over chicken.

The flavor for this one was okay.  Someone recommended throwing in instant rice to cook in the sauce for the last few minutes.  DO NOT do that.  I did and it dramatically took away from the dish.  Cook the rice separately.

I used 7 chicken thighs with skin removed and served this over tri-colored rotini noodles and it was delicious.  Hubby really liked it - this is his type of dish.  

The very dry sherry I used really added to this dish. I used Campbell's brand creamed soup which seemed slightly less salty than my usual store brand.  I did use the celery salt (just a sprinkle) and didn't find it too salty.  My parmesan cheese was green and purple so I threw it out and used this intense extra sharp cheese I had bought from Costco.  That turned out really well.  Next time if I'm using chicken thighs I will use 9 or more as I had plenty of sauce left over this time.

Fresh sliced mushrooms in this dish would be great. Will add that next time.  But even as is, excellent dish.  Nice sherry flavor.

Typically I really enjoy recipes from this submitter, but this recipe was a unique bomb.  I thought it tasted and smelled like cat food and I followed the instructions to a t, though I used 4 breasts with the bone in instead of 10 skinless boneless, which is about 15 dollars worth of meat.  Husband said he'd eat it, but it was unbelievably salty and the flavor was just downright bad.

This is a regular in our house!  I usually omit the celery salt and go easy on the regular salt because canned soups tend to add a lot of sodium anyway.  I also add some instant rice in the last 10 minutes or so and it turns out great.  This is great for working moms like me!

I just tried this recipe today and it was delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and only used cream of mushroom soup.   Since I didn't have any dry sherry I used white wine as a substitute.   When the chicken was done, I removed it from the pot and thicken the gravy with some flour and milk and included some onion flakes.   Then I put the chicken back in the pot again to reheat.   I made vericelli with this and when this was done I put in a tablespoon of butter and some garlic oil.    Then, it's just a matter of putting some pasta on your plate and covering it with a piece of chicken and some gravy.   Delicious.

Tasty meal.  I served over rice in my version of chicken a la king.  I was worried about the sherry overpowering the flavor.  No worries, mate.  Everything turned out fine.

I usually do not enjoy chicken breasts made in the slow cooker.  For some reason, they always seem to have a funny flavor.  However, I decided to give this one a shot and it was a big hit with my husband and I.  I used only cream of mushroom soup since I halved the recipe.  Will definitely repeat!

Everyone in the family agreed-this was wonderful!
The chicken was so moist and tender.  I especially loved it because it was so easy.  I didn't have parmesan cheese in the morning so I picked some up during the day, served the chicken over egg noddles and sprinkled parmesan and mozzerella cheese on top.

This was good!  I will leave the paprika out next time; it left a slight after taste.  I am glad that I had already decided to shred it, because it was so tender it was falling apart.  I added sour cream to it too and served it over rice.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks so much!

Easy, simple, and good for hectic days.  I used white wine instead of sherry and it was good.  My thing is this...I have seen tons of ratings and people say my kid is so finicky and loved this dish...I would serve it to my finicky daughter and no go.  My girl eats, cheese, bacon, and sometimes potates...and she is 7.  She ate every bite of this chicken and the rice.  OMG!  I thought she fed it to the cat. hehehe!

I was really psyched to do this recipe.  It came out very tasty, but one thing I've 
learned from slow cooking is that chicken breasts just always tend to come out too
dry and mealy.  If this recipe is adapted to a conventional cooking method then
I'll bet it'll be a real winner.

Marvelous! This recipe was so easy to prepare. My picky 10-year-old eater cleaned her plate. Miracles do happen. Will try this recipe on the inlaws.

We really like this recipe. I omitted the celery salt as suggested. The chicken was really flavorful. I served it over seasoned sauteed cauliflower rice with a side of green beans sauteed in olive oil, garlic and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.

Most articles indicate we are not to wash chicken due to spread of bacteria in the area of the sink.
Also is it possible to make this without canned soup.  I never use them any more.  Too much salt and unnecessary ingredients.
I never even try a recipe if it calls for canned soup.
I really can't rate the recipe, I just had questions/comments but I bet it would taste great.

Was easy to half..used 1 can mush. soup and fresh sautéed mushrooms, 2 large breasts.  White meat does not need so long to cook.  Brown them in butter and give the recipe less hours.  we have different crock pots so check after 2 hrs on high and proceed from there.Edit the new safety on washing chicken or other meat is DON'T … it spreads salmonella or listeria , Ecoli whatever all over your sink, towels etc.  The cooking will kill the bacteria if  heat is applied as recipes suggest.

I've made this countless times. Very tasty and easy. It works just fine with the "healthier" version of creamed soups (lower fat and sodium). Mushrooms canned or fresh make a nice addition too. Perfect over rice or with a side of mashed potatoes as it makes its own gravy.

I had no celery salt or celery soup, so I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and Everything Bagel Seasoning instead of salt and pepper. A little different flavor..,but good!

Delish!  Since it was a meal for two, I used 2 chicken breasts, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, about 1/3 cup Fairbanks sherry, 2 stalks diced celery, celery salt pepper, dusting of garlic powder and a generous coating of smoked paprika -- it makes a big difference!  The gravy was excellent; served it and the chicken over Cajun rice with Louisiana hot sauce.

It's a good start! This needs ALOT more spices added into it. We added more onion and garlic powder, added dried parsley and chives, and extra salt and pepper. I prefer to make this with season-all and cajun seasoning as well. We serve this with rice, and it comes out great for a crowd.

OK, so I didn't have ALL the ingredients but substituted.I didn't have celery salt, but I did have celery seed and paired that with salt. I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of celery soup. And I didn't have dry Sherry, so I used whiskey instead. Didn't have Parmesan so i used a Monterrey jack and cheddar blend. I cooked (half thawed chicken) on low for about 4 hours and then added two fresh pints of mushrooms, let it cook for about another hour. Looked too soupy for our liking and added dry egg noodles. I mixed and let cook for another 20 minutes. Noodles are soft and cooked through! Tastes GREAT!

Will definitely make again. Very good taste. I did blow it however by using red wine instead of sherry or white wine. The red color combined with the celery soup made the sauce a dark purply gray. Not something you would want to serve guests!!!

Man this recipe is dangerously addicting. I made it just as described except I didn't cook it quite as long (only 3.5 hrs. on high). I think my crock pot cooks a little hotter, however, I followed the remainder of the recipe just as posted. Chicken was tender and not dried out, I put it on rice, but I think it would be just as good on egg noodles. It made a lot for two of us, but it is as good cold, so I have plenty of leftovers. Only con; is it was a little salty for my wife (she still said it was good however), I on the other hand loved it.

I forgot the Parmesan cheese. Didn’t have Sherry so I used Port (per website search for substitutes for Sherry).  Added 1/2 small can of mushrooms. 
The sauce was runnier than I’d like. Serving over rice helped. The flavor was great. Could taste the Port but wasn’t overwhelming. Cooked for 8 hours on low and chicken was perfect. I halved the pieces prior to serving. 
Next time I’ll add more mushrooms. And remember the cheese. :-)

My family loved this recipe! I made it as is and it was delicious! It was so creamy. I made Mushrooms on the side and threw it top of the chicken. I also made a side of rice pilaf. I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker so I put it in the oven at 350* for 1 hour. Thanks!

Not much flavor to this.  I would add some fresh mushrooms , and try the sour cream/flour advice as well.  My chicken breasts were dry because I cooked them too long (6 hours).  Next time I will try 4 hours instead.

This was actually inedible. Made as specified, except used Pacific Foods gluten-free soups. Maybe that was it, but I doubt it. I think the combination of the wine, cheese and soup just didn't work out.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have cream of chicken and celery so I used the cream of chicken and mushroom I had in the pantry.  Other than that, I used plenty of salt, pepper and smoky paprika. I served it over mashed potatoes and it was yummy!

My husband loved this. I pounded the chicken breasts out to make them an even thickness and bakedit in a 350 F oven for about 40 minutes. It was perfectly paired with wild grain rice and a green salad.

This was absolutely amazing and definitely one to add into the rotation. I'm more of a "guesser" type in seasonings so I just plopped as much as I wanted in a cup. I added garlic powder to the mix and stirred well, then rubbed the mix in the chicken on both sides. Since I was making double servings I double the soups (two mushroom, two celery, 2 1/3 cups of sherry). I mixed in some parmesan  cheese in the mixture too. Before putting the soups on the chicken I just squeezed bottled lemon juice over the chicken then spooned the soups over and placed it on high for 3-4 hours. About an hour before serving I added some baby bella mushrooms and some extra garlic and onion powder. I served it on top of cooked farfelle noodles and it was a big hit! My brother said to make it again, and he doesn't usually say that unless he really likes it!

Very easy to make and taste like you spent a lot more time on it then it really took.  I added a 12 oz package of cleaned sliced mushrooms to the recipe.  I just layered them on top of the chicken before pouring the sauce over. I will definitely make again.

It was good but definitely needed some more spices.  For a thicker sauce, perhaps take the lid off the crock-pot for the last hour.  Less time in the cooker would have been good, too, as it was falling apart as I scooped it out.

I followed the recipe and cooked 8 hours. Flavor was okay but breasts were dry. If I make it again, I will probably try it in the oven. Hubby and I weren't impressed especially since it was dry. Maybe add more lemon juice.

I made this recipe pretty much according to how it is written. I used cream of celery soup and low sodium cream of mushroom soup. I skipped the celery salt, and used some Montreal Chicken seasoning instead. I did use actual cooking sherry--got it in the cooking aisle, not the wine aisle. I forgot the parmesan cheese, but it totally didn't need it! I used 3 chicken breasts, and this was not too much extra sauce. I served this over tri-color bowtie pasta and with mashed cauliflower. My husband and I both loved it! This is a keeper!

I always follow recipes to the letter. Rarely do I alter,  change , add or omit ingredients. As long as my family like what I put on the table, that tells me I did it right. I always get compliments from family and friends.

I didn't realize this was a slow cooker recipe and it was almost 5 p.m. when I started this recipe.  So I popped the whole thing in the oven and it still came out fabulous.  Next time I will put it in the crock pot and I'm sure it will be even better.

Chicken is tender and moist.  I set the crockpot  on High for about 4 hours.  Then I lowered it to Low for a little more than an hour because it was boiling rapidly.  I also started off with frozen breasts.  Husband really enjoyed it!

Husband loved it.  It is so easy and very tasty.  I added 1 can of whole potatoes around 30 minutes before serving and topped them with the sauce when serving.  As always, I added garlic powder to the chicken; otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I didn't use the crock pot since I had 1/2 of our home grown chicken.  It was very unpleasant. I threw away the copy of the recipe and will try to remake it into something else tomorrow night.

Love reading all the reviews for the changes everyone makes to the original recipe but I made this exactly as written and found it quite excellent.   Sorry I did have to use white wine instead of sherry.
Another time I will like to try the suggestion of frozen chicken breasts when that might  be what I have on hand - a useful tip. And an addition of garlic or onions would be good.  Like so many recipes on this site - the user  variations and suggestions are why I subscribe.  Each reader can take it or leave it!

I really wonder about people sometimes.  Doesnt anyone look at the ingredients first? this recipe is wonderful, it's meant to be a hands off one pot time saver, thus the soup versus fresh mushroom and a creamy roux. as far as bland, again, did anyone look at the ingredients? this dish is supposed to shine on the sherry and the chicken.  and it does! If you see the ingredients and you dont see your cayenne or your special black pepper from the far east.. do you think you're going to taste it?  you know your tastes, theres no harm in expanding on a recipe to include it.  and if you dont like the soup idea , do this the old fashioned and time consuming way of on top of the stove with a cream roux. If you are going to use soup, dont use bargain canned soups, get a good knorr soup, or a premier brand.
And for the people who pitch a fit over adjusting a recipe to your own taste.... recipes arent laws, they're methods, they're ideas, they're meant to be individually tailored to taste.  Heres some more ideas, to change it up a bit more add some crispy bacon crumbles on top before serving, some celery seed, and some ground black pepper  in the crock pot, give it a cajun twist with some cajun seasoning. Enjoy!.  This is a wonderful recipe and Im glad to see it here.

Really good! Only made four chicken breasts but kept amounts the same. No cream of celery on hand and added a bit of adobo. There were no leftovers the family ate it all up and dipped bread in the sauce to clean their plates!

We really enjoyed this. We wound up shredding the chicken (2 large breasts and all other ingredients stayed the same) and served with green beans and mashed potatoes. Would definitely make this again! We didn't think it was too salty.

This was easy to put together and it came out great! The chicken just fell apart with a fork. Yummy! The only change I made was to sprinkle a little garlic powder over everything once it was in the crockpot. I will definitely make this again. :)

skipped the celery salt and paprika, as we just moved a month ago and I haven't restocked all of my spices yet!  I put it on high for 4 hours and the chicken was already rather dry. The sauce was great, though! Next time I'll do it for less time or on low and see what happens. I'm thinking of adding mushrooms and carrots in the future - will definitely try again! I did only have 6 chicken breasts, but they were pretty large!

It was okay. I served it over orzo. My chicken didn't get cooked all the way through and it was on low for 9 hours. That's never happened before. I prefer crock pot meals that include vegetables so I probably won't make this again.

Excellent!. I added some onion flakes and a little bit of garlic to the soup mixture.

I also shredded the chicken  after it was cooked. Stirred in 1/2 cup of sour cream into the crock pot. Added the chicken back in and then served it over white rice.

Made this as stated, other than used cream of chicken soup along with cream of mushroom, didn't have celery.  Great flavor
served with rice and mixed veggies, and homemade bread. 
Will surely make again.

I've had this recipe for years. the first time I made it my family devoured it. It is such a good dinner.  We (married daughter and I) make it for our families all the time. It's a good company dish also.

This was excellent!  Hubby made it and used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup with the cream of celery because that's what we had.  He was also a bit more liberal with the paprika and the sherry.  It was excellent!  The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  We served it over jasmine rice with cooked carrots - yum!

My family and I did not care for this dish.  Every time I make chicken breast it turns out dry.  I will not be making it again.

Absolutely delicious! I had no leftovers becuase my family gobbled this up! I used a can of Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom and it worked just fine. Highly recommended, I can't wait to make this again!

This was decent.  The only change I made was to sprinkle the chicken first with lemon pepper.  That was tasty.  The only minus is that the chicken breasts were a little dry.  I'll try with bone in chicken next time.  Will definitely make it again.

I want to start off by saying that I am not a measuring type person, I am more of a "guesstimator" the reason that I rated this 5 stars is that my WHOLE family it. This includes a very very picky two year old who cleaned his plate!! I would like to note that i did add a small amount of sour cream and replaced celery salt with celery seed because that is what i had. I will definitely be making this again!

We really liked this a lot....considering I really do not like chicken breast because it is always so dry this was very moist and the gravy was excellent especially on the mashed red potatoes that I made to go along...I was out of paprika and celery salt so i just used a little celery seed, salt and pepper...I also cut recipe in half with chicken breast but still used full cans of soup and just 3 tablespoons of sherry...will make again!  Also only cooked for about 8 hrs not 10...Thanks!

This was very good.  I didn't use any cream of mushroom soup because I don't like it, but the cream of celery soup with the wine was plenty of moisture for the recipe.  The chicken was incredibly tender.  I served it over brown rice with some fresh sauteed veggies.  Yum!

My hubby and I LOVED this recipe!  I had followed some other reviewers' suggestions, by adding heavy cream.  I had also scaled down the recipe for our smaller family, and used only one can of cr. of chicken and 1/2 can of heavy cream.  It was AWESOME!

I used the suggestions of a previous review and omitted the celery salt and cream of celery soup.  Instead used one can of cream of mushroom and the a soup can full of heavy cream.  Yummy.  A great comfort food, I served over rice with some steamed veggies and put a little of the sauce all over.

I have used this recipe a couple of times but today I used white zinfadel (1/4 cupe or so )and a small sliced peach.  It came out with just a tinge of fruit flavor and a very slight sweetness.Becasue the sauce was thin I just thickened it with corn starch.  It is indeed a "company" dessert.  Fast prep which is always appealing!

This is a great, creamy, flavorful recipe!  So easy and great served with rice.  The only change I made to the recipe was to slice an onion and place it on the bottom of the slow cooker before I added the chicken and sauce.  The onion becomes so moist and adds a delicious sweetness to the dish!  Very yummy!

I thought it was pretty good. My only problem is that I think that it sat to long. I leave at 6:30am and do not get home until after 7:30 pm, so I think it sat on the "warm" setting to long. But all in all, I really liked the taste of it. This was the 2nd recipe in my crock pot. I think that I might add some additional seasonings next time I make it.

A very easy recipe which I will use often. I had leftover rice, so used the full recipe for 12 servings for two people, only decreasing the chicken to three large breasts. I added about 10 oz of fresh mushroom quarters and one chopped stalk of celery about an hour before it was done. I made another dinner with the leftovers, heating up the chicken and sauce and adding Bisquick dumplings. Great!

It was pretty good but I had to doctor it up quite a bit I thought with parmesan cheese and more seasonings.

Wow!  Made this last night & everyone loved it!  I put it all together in the crock pot the night before & left in on low for 8 hours.  The chicken falls apart it is so tender.  Served it over noodles with mixed veggies on the side.  My husband & son added their veggies into the sauce & said it was a chicken pot pie filling.  Husband said it was the best crock recipe he's tasted!  And I loved it because their all ingredients that I had in the house.  It's a keeper...thanks for sharing!

My whole family really liked this including my 3 young children.  I added green onion & garlic to the crock pot & that really gave it a nice flavor.  I served over noodles with fresh spinach & chopped tomatoes & fresh parmasean cheese.  We really enjoyed it.

This recipe wasn't so good.  I cooked it in the crockpot for five hours on high.  The chicken was basically like a creamed chicken which probably would have been better served over biscuits.  Not much flavor to this one.  Won't make again.

I served this at a Christmas dinner and everyone raved about how tender the chicken was. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems with salt content. I would add some extra vegetables next time though.

This recipe was delicious. Wonderful smell while cooking.  I served this dish with long grain and wild rice, and a hearts of romaine salad with Basalmic Vinagrette dressing...my guests asked for seconds, and the recipe!

This was quick and easy.  The dish has good flavor.  However, I will reduce the salt the next time I make this.

Very good. Chicken was tender but not dry and very flavorful with the sauce. Great, easy weeknight meal.

This was pretty good.  My kids loved it.  It was very easy.  I did not use 10 chicken breast halves which made it possible for extra sauce.  I also love parmasan cheese so I added lots and loved the crunchy brown top.

Too salty for us... and we love salt.  I made the sauce as written (soup + sherry) for our 4 breasts, but added just a pinch of celery salt (and no other salt to taste).  The chicken was dry and tough.  My first real crockpot flop.

As written I'd give it 4 stars.  It was a really easy to prepare.  Basically I just threw everything into the crockpot and went from there.
I added  some garlic, extra pepper and a little bit of italian seasoning to mine.  
BTW...I didn't have celery soup or celery salt.  I substituted chicken soup and just skipped the celery salt.  I also didn't have lemon juice.  
Anyway, really easy and really good.

I have fixed this twice now. Tried it on my husband then felt it was good enough for my daughters birthday. They have 3 children and all loved it. I added mushrooms to the sauce for the last hour.The gravy was wonderful and went great on noodles. Great crock pot receipe. I also used cream sherry as I did not have dry sherry.

Very good and very easy.  I only used four chicken breasts but kept the same amount of sauce because I like my food saucy.  Will definitely make again.

The chicken is very tender out of the crock. It needed more pepper and a lot less salt. Next time I'll add a can of mushrooms to the mix; and I used bourbon instead of sherry.

This was OK.  I sliced an onion over the chicken and added garlic and some Cavender's Greek seasoning.

After reading some of the other reviews, I guess I must have done something wrong.  My whole family did not like this at all.  I did not like the flavor or taste of this, found very bland.
