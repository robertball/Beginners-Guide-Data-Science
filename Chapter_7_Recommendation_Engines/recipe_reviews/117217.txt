We are innsitting for some friends and served this as the fruit appetizer at the Royal Folly B&B in Annapolis.   We served 2 halves to each person with a scoop of mascrapone cheese (which had toasted pecans and maple syrup blended in) in the center of each.   Reduced the liquid quite a bit, drizzled it on the plate sprinkled with more toasted pecans and a few raspberries.   Awesome!   Everyone ate every drop!

I used 1.25 cups oj and .25 cup rum - could probably have even gone 2 parts to 1 part rum.  Also, had to poach for closer to 35 minutes, and this was with quartered pieces small pears. Overall, delicious!

Oh my gosh is this ever good!  I don't even like pears generally but these were great.  I used ground cinnamon instead of a stick.  I also cooked the syrup a bit longer after the pears were done just to thicken it a bit.  I made a mixture of softened cream cheese, honey, and toasted pecans to top the pears with.  Then I drizzled over the thick syrup.  We are having these again very soon.

Very tasty.  Very simple.  Nice light dessert.  I didn't have cinnamon sticks, so I substituted ground cinnamon and it was fine.

We loved this recipe!  I've never made poached pears before and was pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of it - and the awesome results.  It was delicious!  I topped the pears with homemade Cardamom Cream (Just 1 cup heavy cream,1 Tbsp superfine sugar, and 1 teaspoon ground cardamom whipped until stiff peaks form)It was a very interesting, delicious pairing!

Followed the recipe exactly (using canned pears) and it was awesome the first day. However, in the fridge we kept it in the syrup we served it with, and they dried up and turned into rocks. Store separate from syrups, and add them when you serve.

These were delicious and very easy to make. They would also be very tasty  with the pears served warm alongside a small scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream!

I thought this recipe as is was only OK.  I probably won't make this again.  I'm sure a little whip cream and some additional fruits or nuts would improve this a lot.

Sooo good! I'm not a pear fan but now have a good reason to buy them. I made the recipe exactly as directed and it tasted great. I then decided to experiment and take some soft honey nut cream cheese, warm slightly in the microwave and add a tad of maple syrup to thin and then drizzled on top of the whole thing. Great recipe, will definitely make again.

Absolutely Fabulous!  Once I removed the pears from the liquid, I let it reduce for more of a saucy texture and served it over the pears!  Fresh squeezed orange juice is best.

Increased the recipe slightly for a large group we were making dessert for.  It turned out awesome.  Agree with others to reduce remaining liquid to a syrupy drizzle.  Definitely use the cinnamon stick.  It added such a nice subtle hint of flavor.

This was amazing.  Great dessert which was quick and easy to make and will WOW your guests by the presentation (looks like you would get it in a 5 star restaurant).  I added 1 cup of white wine to the sauce and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. YUM!

Wow...seriously good! Had it with whipped cream and topped it with macerated strawberries....soo yummy. I took out the pears when they were tender and simmered the sauce a little longer to thicken up.

Delicious and extremely sweet!  I used maraschino cherries as a garnish instead of raspberries, but I bet the tartness of fresh raspberries would set off the sweetness even better.

I  added chocolate (semi sweet and half and half)  and toasted almond slices.  My pears were smallish so I simmered them whole. Swapped what I had, strawberries instead of raspberries. Big HIT!

These were very easy to prepare and turned out to be an elegant dish!  I loved that the rest of the ingredients are items I often have on hand.  I served these over warm ginger bread cake (from a mix) with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and the syrup from the pears poured over the top.  Delicious and great for guests!

I loved these! Served with whipped cream and a sprinkling of sherried orange pistachios. I used the "Sherried Orange Walnuts" recipe also on this site, using pistachios instead of walnuts. I didn't have raspberries on hand, but nobody missed them.

Excellent but added a little Grand Marnier to the poaching liquid to make it a little more special. I served this with a topping of whipped cream.

This is absolutely delicious and so simple so make! However, the syrup is VERY sweet so you only need a little drizzle to serve.

I made them as instructed with a little twist. Lots of Cinnamon (ground), 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/2 c. white wine, served with Marscapone, the sauce (boiled down with some sugar) and melted semisweet chocolate drizzled on top. It was enjoyed by all. My pears were organic and a little under-ripe so I let them simmer for about an hour on the stove. Very Yummy. Will make again. :)

A light and delicious dessert to serve with whip cream or ice cream.  Made the recipe with no changes and it was perfect.  Held up well in the fridge for several days.  I cut each pear so the stem remained on one half of each pear for a decorative effect and it made the dish look lovely.

I don't really care for pears, but I loved this, the whole family did. I made it two days in a row, then ran out of pairs, so sad. I used ground cinnamon, served with quality vanilla ice cream, and reduced liquid to make a heavier sauce.

I was looking for something interesting for a waffle topping and decided to try a variation on this recipe.  All that I did differently was to dice the pears and just before serving I thickened up the juice with a spoonful of corn starch.  The sweet/tangy flavor was a lovely complement to Whole Grain Waffles.  I can't wait to try this recipe for a light dessert next winter when Bartlett pears are one of the few decent fruits in the store.

Simply amazing. I cut the recipe in half (I only had two pears) and threw some candied ginger into the sauce (in order to tie in the Asian meal I was having for dinner.) My guests LOVED it - even the one who doesn't like cooked fruit. Simple. Easy. Elegant. What more can you ask for? I paired it with a honey & simple cream ice cream. TOP NOTCH!

The 4 star review is only because of my family's response...I can't give a 5 if they don't like it:( One refused to touch the syrup, another said it was too cinnamoney and only good after drowning with vanilla ice cream, and the other said it tasted like canned pears...which, in my fresh-fruit loving family, is the ultimate insult. I adored it though:) I halved the recipe and usd 2 TB of sugar, but I think 1 would be good too...I tried it with ice cream like others suggested, but that wasn't appealing to me...the ice cream melted, making the syrup thicker and excessively sweet. But then I tried the leftover syrup over plain yogurt...oh, yummy. Now I'm considering making a batch of the syrup for my morning yogurt, instead of the molasses I usually eat it with:)
Oh, and I had no raspberries...really wish I did.

I left out the berries since I did not have any on hand, but I will try them next time. I served the pears over those little shortcakes and topped off with a little cream. Very easy and elegant.

These were great!  I added a a dash of vanilla and a dash of rum to the orange juice.  Topped it with cream cheese mixed with maple syrup and topped with toasted pecans.  Wow.  loved it!

Instead of adding just orange juice, I added orange juice, apple juice, and cranberry juice. Also, I had to boil the pears for about an hour...

This was a big hit for those dieting and the men who weren't. I used blood orange juice which gave the pears a wonderful rosy color.  I added large pecan pieces with less brown sugar than the recipe. I also thickened the sauce before I topped the pears with organic raspberries and blueberries.

FABULOUS!  Used red skinned pears.  Followed recipe but for berries.  Used another suggestion and put flavored cream cheese (i used almond flavoring),and drizzled butterscotch sauce on top, with some crushed pistachios over.  It was a huge hit on 'games night', and was nice that i could put the pears in and play with my guests w/out standing over the stove.

Very nice little treat.  Served it with vanilla ice cream.  Didn't have cinnamon stick so used some ground cinnamon and it worked great.  Thank you.
