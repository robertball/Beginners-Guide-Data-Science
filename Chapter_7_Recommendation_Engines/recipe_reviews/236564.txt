I just made this tonight. I made some modifications…used a can of tomatoes, 1/2 can diced green chiles, used 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger, added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, and left out the coriander because I didn't have any. This recipe only took me maybe 15 minutes to make because of the canned ingredients (oh, the canned tomatoes made it so that I didn't have to add water at the end). This tasted wonderful! I go to Indian restaurants often and it definitely rivaled the chana masala I've had there. My husband also loved it. There was enough sauce that I probably could have added another can of chickpeas and it would have still been fine. Thank you for the great recipe!

Absolutely, fantastically, delicious. My son's East Indian girlfriend gave it her blessing and said it was a very authentic tasting dish. For that, I'm thrilled.

I found that to get a 'golden brown color' and 'separation of the oil', I had to saute this for 20-30 minutes instead of 2-3. The overcooking must have released a bitter component (from the onion, garlic or ginger). I like the idea of using the blender instead of chopping and grating, but next time would follow the direction to saute for only a few minutes and ignore the direction to saute until golden brown or until the oil separates. Doing the latter two ruined the dish.

I just chopped the vegetables, I did not make this into a paste.  The taste was hot and spicy, the way I enjoy my food!

I tasted this dish at Costco, and loved it! I cook with chick peas a lot, so I was game to try making it myself. It was very easy, I had my 13 year old daughter make it, and it came out pretty good. We skipped the green chile and bay leaf, we didn't have any in the house. It is very savory, and very mild tasting- not one spice overpowering the dish. I used 2 cups of organic dry garbanzo beans, which I soak all day, then boil for about an hour. They were nice and tender, and from that point the preparation of the dish is very quick. Looking forward to eating over some brown rice tomorrow.

Loved it!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is sauté the onions and garlic before blending them.  They never quite cooked, but even still the end result was pretty great.

I prepared this recipe a little differently than indicated, but thought it was a great tasting dish.  I had no garam masala; so I found a recipe here on All Recipes and used it.  That made the recipe a little more time-consuming.  Basically, I heated the olive oil in a pan and added the  onions and then remembered the bay leaf...then I prepared as indicated adding fresh tomatoes, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes and the garam masala.  Then I added in some chickpeas in their juice I had previously made and served it over jasmine rice.  Important note, at first it was bitter, however, when I added the tumeric it toned it down.   Next time I will increase my tomatoes or used canned.  Also, as it was very spicy with the chili I will add in carrots or sweet potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this lovely dish.

We enjoyed this.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients, just went by smell and taste, but kept the proportions close to the recipe, because I started with dry garbanzo beans.  I would surely make this again.

I loved this recipe!  The second time I made it I used canned tomatos and it turned out just fine!  I prefer fresh, but in a pinch canned worked well.

Wow. Really disappointed in this. I followed the recipe exactly and the spicing tasted off, the paste was too liquidy, etc. I actually ended up washing off some of the chickpeas and just eating them plain for dinner. Oh well.

This recipe is very poorly written. 1 tomato, what size how many cups, tablespoons? Tomatoes come in many sizes same with the onion, garlic, and ginger. Then in the preparation it says to turn down to medium but never says to turn higher than medium. There is absolutely no reason to add any water to this. You can’t possibly brown the puréed mixture.  Clarity is a great thing.

WOW!  I used to eat Amy's Matar Paneer and Chana Masala frozen dinner and always loved the chick peas.  This beats that hands down!  My tomato was pretty juicy so the initial ingredients from the food processor weren't technically a paste, but the good news was that I didn't have to add any water.  It kept reducing for the cook time and by the end they were golden and gorgeous.

I knew that the gravy wouldn't be like a beef or turkey gravy rather a thick sauce that would stick to the chickpeas.  I love the grainyness of the sauce.

I made this for a (large) family dinner, so I tripled the recipe. My daughter-in-law is Indian and she has a recipe, but it takes hours to cook down, and this was ready in about 45 minutes and tasted just as good as hers does (she said this). Several of the family are not good with a lot of heat, so I left out the peppers, and I made a mistake and added a heaping teaspoon of cumin thinking it was the chili powder, but it didn't ruin the dish, it just added a bit of complexity to the sauce. I puréed the onions and tomatoes in my blender, and they came out almost the perfect consistency (I did have to add a little bit of water). This was a big hit with young and old.

It's not EXACTLY like the restaurant chana masala I am used to, but it is very good. If you want chana masala in a pinch and don't have the special ingredients like chana masala spice blend and amchur powder, this seems like a great go to. We ate it with basmati rice and naan. I will probably make this again, though I may keep tweaking the spices to get the perfect flavor! I mostly followed the recipe but I made a few little changes 1) I probably used less ginger because I doubled the recipe but only had one inch and a half-sized knob. 2) I used roma tomatoes, which were small, so I doubled the amount of tomatoes 3) for the spices, I added a teaspoon of cumin and cut the chili powder in half because I wasn't sure it was the right kind. 4) like other reviewers pointed out, the paste didn't cook as fast as the recipe seems to say it will, so the chickpeas were in a sort of crunchy gravy. My canned chickpeas were also sort of too firm, so I simmered them in the gravy for 20 minutes which cooked down the paste and made the chickpeas more tender (and melded the flavors a lot more). 5) I added a dash of sugar, 6) I used some veggie broth instead of water because I had it opened in the fridge and it made more sense. 7) It seemed like it was missing some acidity, so I added a few good splashes of  lemon juice. Overall, very yummy and definitely worthwhile!

This is one of our favorite regular meals. We serve it over brown rice. Always double the recipe (triple chickpeas) so there's plenty of leftovers for lunches.

I browned the onion and garlic as the comment said below, a very good suggestion! What an amazing recipe! I ate it with rice and cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli! I think it would be amazing to experiment with a rich nut like pine nuts or cashews

definitely needs at least a tsp of salt rather than the suggested "dash", but otherwise this was great! I'll be making it again!

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. I used two jalepenos, 6 cloves of garlic, half a can of coconut milk instead water, and added an extra can of chick peas. My little ones ate it, even the hot peppers.

We loved it- with a couple of exceptions.. I did not make the paste- just finely chopped the onions, garlic and ginger and cooked til soft, added the dry seasonings and let cook  about three minutes.  Added water to make the gravy and then drained chick peas and three cups of cooked cauliflower.   After testing  I went back and doubled the cumin, chili, coriander and turmeric- PERFECTION!

This was pretty bland (even with the chili). I may not have made it right since I found some of the steps in the instructions pretty ambiguous or difficult to follow. I couldn't get the golden brown color within a reasonable amount of cooking time. The "paste" was pretty liquidy. A thick gravy consistency could mean a wide range of things.

I modified this slightly... Used 3 roma tomatoes) that's all I had) I omitted the chilies because I didn't have any, I used nearly 2 inch knob of ginger and grated in fresh turmeric.  I added cubed sweet potato with the the chick peas and a block of frozen spinach.  

I sautéed for about 10 minutes until it was no longer vibrant red and really until it dried up all the moisture from the tomatoes.  Added about a cup of water as needed and simmered.  Oh my goodness it was absolutely delicious.  Wanted to swim in the pan!  Perfect dish for whole food plant based lifestyle.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. Best Chana Masala I've ever made . I did use red chili peppers instead of green, and used dried cilantro instead of fresh, but I like it spicy, do I added a little more of the spices. Still, soooo good. Make This Recipe!

I modified this recipe by adding two cans of chickpeas. I initially used one can, but it tasted too onion-y. Either add less onion or put more chickpeas. Pretty great recipe overall though! Next time I’ll make two batches though because this got eaten up very quickly! :)

This  was exceptional! I made it exactly as written except I added coconut milk instead of water as it thickened. I could have eaten a whole bowl of it. Its also very quick to make. Make sure you use garam masala. Also I garnished each person's serving with red curry paste to mix in. Fabulous!  PD - this tastes like a very authentic Indian dish

I made this dish following the recipe... taking liberties only with adding a 3rd bay leaf and more garlic. I also dashed some cumin in there now that I'm thinking about it. I was concerned using a whole onion but it paid off. The key was the slow simmer for sure. It ended up in simmer land for about 2 hours I think. I bet it's gonna taste better tomorrow! This is totally a new fave!

With a large tomato and onion, definitely use 2 cans of beans. You will love this.  Otherwise I left it unchanged and enjoyed it several times

Tasty, though my onion and tomato mixture never quite browned.  After adding the spices, it was definitely looking more like it "should have", though.  Definitely needs some salt at the end to bring out the spices, but easy, fun to make, and tasty.

It’s good but not nearly as good as I’ve had at a few restaurants. Not spicy enough and flavor isn’t as complex.

My wife and I finally purchased the missing seasonings for this and made it tonight. The aroma of the sauce/paste cooking in our small sauté pan. The instructions weren’t super clear but we figured it out easily enough. We used one of the suggestions of using canned tomatoes and chiles and added some cayenne pepper. We wanted this to be more filled if so we topped basmati rice with this and it’s a match made in heaven.

I loved the combination of ingredients but I don't think it's possible to make this recipe as it's written.  
The tomato "paste" had a high liquid content.  It would be very dangerous to add this mixture to hot oil.  A novice cook could really hurt themselves.  
Really nice flavors, quite a bit of tweaking required.

It’s pretty good! I didn’t have tomatoes so I used Rotel hot tomatoes (the Mexican flavor kind) and didn’t add chili because of this, and it worked out well!!!

This was a big hit, and really easy considering it was my first time making chana masala. The only thing I would change is perhaps to use a little less chili powder if you're sensitive to spiciness. And I added some green onions on top for additional garnish. Otherwise, pretty delicious.

I did not use oil but just used water to sauté the bay leaves. I used 2 cans of chickpeas (with the juice of only one can) and added a half teaspoon of cumin. Oh, I also used a jalapeño instead of a chili pepper! I like my foods spicy spicy, so this worked out perfectly. I didn’t have to add any extra water in addiction to the juices from the chickpeas. Absolutely delicious!

I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but after grinding the tomatoes, onions, etc. it did not form a paste, but was very watery.  I still proceeded as per directions.  There was something very bitter tasting in the liquid - and trying to find out what made it so bitter.  After I strained the chick peas of the bitter liquid, they were delicious and am glad I doubled the recipe.  In spite of the bitter taste, I still gave it a five star rating because this recipe is easy and delicious.

I enjoyed it and it had just enough spice for me. I used can tomato and can green chilies and canned click peas. I think a second can of chick peas could be added because there was a lot of sauce. The sauce had a good flavor and could probably be used to cook chicken or shrimp. I will make it again but might try using the fresh tomatoes and green chilies.

Not sure what to make of this.  When I first prepared it, the onions tasted raw, even after cooking for an extended period of time.  However, when we ate it (I purposely cooked this a few days prior to when we planned on eating) it tasted great!  If I make again, I will make sure to prepare days in advance once more.  Spices as listed are pretty mild here and can be amped up to taste.

Made this last night it was very good and my husband loved it. Only changes I made was I added two tomatoes instead of one and also i added a small packet of sugar to the sauce. The sugar cut out the sourness. Also I didn’t have any cilantro so I omitted it and added tiny bit of dried parsley.  Dish came out tasty.

Great recipe. I messed my first batch up with too much red  pepper. That's what I get for not following exactly- Less pepper next time. I let the paste cook more in the beginning after reading reviews. I ate it over riced cauliflower, which "sucked" the flavor out of it (heat from the red pepper was still in tact though. .) Recipe isn't the same taste as my favorite restaurant channa, but a definite keeper because it tastes good & is easy to make.

Had the ingredients so decided to try making it, and it turned out amazing! I added yellow peppers and omitted ginger, and it’s going to be a regular dish in my house now!!

I substituted an Anaheim pepper for a Chile pepper and added another can of garbanzo beans and it turned out great! Even my mom who doesn't like spicy food thought it was perfect.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe with the exception of only using one hot pepper (jalepeno) and choosing one large-sized tomato with the thought that more pulp and tomato juice would yield a more sauce-like texture after processing with the onion, ginger, etc. This method seemed to work, and I did not need to add more water to create a gravy—the sauce was perfect as is.  The leftovers are sitting beside me as I write this and anxiously await my lunch break so that I can enjoy this dish again!

Will make again. My vegan son loved it - he always orders it when eating Indian out, so I thought I'd give it a shot at home. The only thing I did differently was to thin it with coconut milk instead of water. Oh - and for us the salt was way off - I put in 1/4 tsp at a time until it tasted right and ended up doing that 4 times. So a whole tsp. of salt. Thanks for the recipe, latinmama!

Followed recipe. Didn’t add anything not listed. Didn’t change anything that was listed. Dish turned out wonderful. 
I wondered if the can of chickpeas should be drained before adding. I didn’t drain mine and simply cooked the dish a bit longer to get the thickness desired. 
I used an actual tomato, not canned tomatoes and everything did fine. I used a little higher heat than medium to separate the oil and brown the sauce faster. 
This is a very adequate and delicious recipe. I’m keeping it.

I used dry chana soaked overnight and pressure cooked, three medium roma tomatoes, 3/4 a large white onion. The green chili I used was a small thai chili and the chili powder hot Indian pepper. I also used a pinch of hing. Very good! Thank you so much!

Excellent.  Just like my Indian friend used to make for me.  Now I can make for myself any time I crave this spicy treat.  Combine with white rice and naan bread for a meatless meal of its own.

Delicious! I left out the chili pepper to make this less spicy and apart from that followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and I'll make a double recipe next time.

Not with Olive Oil, Didnt mash the tomato with the onion. It turned out lovely  with a little bit of Channa Masala powder from MDH. Loved it more than the one my wife makes - just lip smacking and beautiful to look at

I was in India in December and bought many spices.  I used a very spicy garlic masala, garam masala, tumeric.  This recipe is delicious.

I made this for my husband, and he loved it! I used serano chilis, so it was very zippy (a bit too much for my taste). Served over cauliflower rice, and it was very healthy meal.

This was an incredibly easy, fun, fragrant dish to make. My daughter and I loved it. I served it with samosas I bought from the corner restaurant. I forgot to buy ginger so I used ground ginger and I also used canned diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this again.

i think the water as needed threw it off. I wasn't sure what the consistency should have been. I found the flavor to be bland. I ended up adding curry and more seasoning to get more flavor.

Dish was good not great and a bit too bland for me. I thought the base was too thin and not flavorful enough so I added a can of tomato paste cilantro and cayenne pepper, and cumin. Then it was pretty good.

Really enjoyed this dish. I would add more chickpeas to it or possibly double the recipe if this was going to be your main entree.  I served mine over rice and it was enough for my wife and I. However it didn't leave any leftovers.

It was really great.  However I found that I could not make it according to your recipe.  You said to cook the onions, etc.  until the oil separates from the vegetables, but even though it said to grind the vegetables first, I had to cook the vegetables much longer.  I'm familiar with cooking onions and garlic until the oil separates and that alone can take up to 30 minutes, not just the 4 to 5 minutes you stated.  Also, serrano peppers can vary in spiciness, you should check them for heat first.

Excellent recipe. I did not use a food processor but rather tossed those items in the skillet. I also did not measure anything and used canned tomatoes.   Definite make this again.

Recipe followed exactly, used 1 large fresh tomato although added a little left over tomato sauce from my mum's dinner to add some more tomatoeyness! Love Indian food and feel that this tastes very authentic. I agree with others that the paste doesn't really brown but I cooked it for about 3-4 minutes on high heat and followed the rest of the recipe and it came out beautiful! I made it for lunch for tomorrow but I can't stop eating it!

Just ok. Didn't taste like I was hoping(closer to an Indian restaurant Chana masala). Too much garlic and I love garlic.

Excellent! The only ingredient I didn't add is water. The tomatoes I used had plenty enough water for the receipt.

Very good version of Chana Masala!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also omitted adding any extra water.  It's a fast meal as well--30 min. start to finish!

Its not possible to brown the blended mixture unless you stand over it for a very long time. Theres something missing from this recipe  but I cant put my finger on it.  I am a very good cook with commercial cooking experience and dont know enough about East Indian cooking to master it. Thats why I give it 3.

Very tasty I put ghost peppers in instead and didn't make paste at beginning but grilled the onions and garlic then added the spices.  Added double the curry spice as I like it spicy and curry flavour.  Big hit on basmati rice!

I just made this today and it came amazing. I also made a double batch and had no issues in flavor I literally just doubled all ingredients. Only thing I did add was some  spinach and  left out the cilantro garnish. I will most definitely be saving and coming back to this recipe. I no longer have to buy this premade in the frozen section.

Amazed I could make Indian food with what I had in my pantry! I used black beans (what I had on hand) and it was great. Chopped up a bulb of garlic instead of onion and used powdered ginger and red pepper flakes. No need to haul out the food processor. Was a bit too liberal with the red pepper flakes. Very spicy!

I made it tonight for my family.  I did not make any changes but,  as the recipe suggests, I left out the green chiles since I was cooking for two young children.  They both ate it ... willingly!!  This one is a win.

This was alright as written.  I do try most recipes as written first.  It was a little bland.  After I added some additional ingredients it was good.  I'll make it again but only with my additional spices.

I meddled with the quantities and prolonged the cooking times a bit, the result was much appreciated indeed by whoever got a taste of it. Especially brilliant was the initial vegetable paste, which blended really nicely with the peas and gave them that thick feel. Tasty and savory.

I made this last night with a couple of changes. I doubled the recipe, used fresh garbanzo (from dried) instead of canned, 2 fresh jalapenos from the garden, about 6 smallish tomatoes from garden (skinned). Instead of all the listed spices, I used "Simply Organic Curry Powder," which is a mix of the spices in the recipe along with some additions. I didn't have ginger on hand, so left that out. At the very end of cooking, I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of organic sour cream. I served over white rice.

Having never ventured into the curry arena before, I was surprised at how well this turned out. My family was really impressed, and it was really delicious! I plated it by molding the white sticky rice in circular molds, then carefully heaped the curry on top and down one side of each rice mold. It looked really gorgeous and professional. Success! This recipe is a keeper!

I made it as directed except with dried, cooked chick peas instead of canned.  I feel like I'm eating in my favorite restaurant.  I will make it again.  Next time I'll serve it with Palak Paneer.

Rich, exotic flavor and meaty texture. I used dried chickpeas and pressure cooked them. The texture is more firm than canned chickpeas but either works.  Naan bead makes a nice addition.

Wonderful meal.  We had company with children and the kids asked for seconds (as did the adults).  Only change I would make is to drain the peas before adding them to the sauce.

I followed two reader's suggestions and sauteed the onions and garlic together before I added them to my Vitamix. However, I did use a can of diced tomatoes with their juice so my sauce was not really a "paste" but rather a thick "soup". 

I followed everything else almost to the letter, although I didn't wait for the oil separation to occur because after 2-3 minutes it still wasn't happening and I didn't want it to get bitter (which happened to someone who made this!). 

I think the key to actually get the separation is to actually use fresh tomatoes and get an actual paste and not a "thick soup", I cooked mine in a big pot so when they say "large saucepan" I think it's an actual large pan so you can spread ALL the paste and it gets direct contact with heat/oil. I'll do that next time. I didn't add any water because of the juice of the canned tomatoes and also used TWO cans of chickpeas because it was way too much sauce for just one can.

I managed to separate this into 6 servings and they were very generous. Very filling when paired with a serving of rice :)

I wanted to use up some cans of chick peas so I was looking for an quick, easy recipe. I didn't change anything at all, just substituted some dry ingredients for fresh and it was so good. Everyone raved. With the rest of the dinner coming from our local samosa hut, it was the perfect companion. I will be making this again for sure, but will get the fresh ingredients on hand this time.

I loved the flavor of the recipe!  it was easily the best chana masala I've had.  I have used a spice mix in the past but couldn't find the spice mix anymore at the grocery store so I decided to try and make it from scratch.   I will make it from this recipe from now on, I liked it so much!

Bitter. Had to fix with other ingredients to be edible. I suspect the proportions are off. Too much onion, ginger, garlic & other spices for the amount of chickpeas. Not sure.. but I too, followed the recipe exactly and the result was poor. 
I added a bit of white vinegar. Helped a bit.

My Chana Masala turned out perfectly! I used a 15oz can of petite diced tomatoes with green chilies, and bought the "hot" version for some extra spice. I also used ginger garlic paste that I picked up from the indian grocery store, and used about 2 tablespoons. I loves cilantro so I threw a handful into the dish as well as garnished with it. Finally, I think I did add about a tsp of salt versus a 'dash'. It turned out spicy and flavorful, just how I like it! It's very filling and so quick to whip up! I will definitely make it again.

Bland for my palate.  Added another teaspoon gaman masala and over one teaspoon of ground cumin.  Extra salt.  Next time I will add another jalapeno.

I added juice from half a lime. And a lot more garam masala and cumin than a teaspoon, like 1/4 cup each. So good!

I put in an entire head of garlic and doubled the ginger and spices, and still found this really bland. Won't make again.

Quite easy to make. It ended up being a bit too spicy for me (but I can't take anything spicy! So don't worry, it's me, not the recipe) so I added some coffee cream in to counteract it. Turned out tasty.
