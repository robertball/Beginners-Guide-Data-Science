This turned out GREAT but I did make some modifications.  Substituted muenster for the swiss, increased milk to 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 c. dry sherry to the soup/milk mixture.  Sprinkle chicken generously with garlic powder, poultry seasoning and some black pepper before placing cheese on top.  Pour sauce mixture evenly over and then top with 1 1/2 cups Stove Top Stuffing mix(chicken flavor) mixed with melted butter.  Followed baking directions as written.  Sprinkled some grated parmesan over the top for last 5 minutes of baking.  Also, using lowfat evaporated milk is a great way to cut some fat and get a real creamy result.

Very delicious!! After reading reviews I decided to add two pieces of swiss and I used 2 cans of cream of chx and mushroom soup. One can of soup didnt seem to cover all the chicken. I also topped heavily with chicken flavored stove top stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs. That added alot of flavor. The only thing I will do differntly next time is use the low sodium cream chx/mush soup. My family absolutely loved it. The melted swiss chees and soup combo couldnt of been tastier. Will definetly make again!!

This recipe has turned out to be the basis for one of our favorite recipes.  I, like many others, have made some changes to the base recipe.  I use combinations of soups to get different flavors.  My favorites are the Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs combined with Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic.  I also use sour cream instead of milk with the soups.  I add some dried lemon peel and top it off with poppy seeds, Cheddar Fried Onions, and grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I'd tried it with crumbled Ritz crackers, and I loved it, but my husband is not fond of the Ritz on oven-baked foods.

No matter how you flavor it, these chicken breasts always come out juicy and tender.  Thanks!!!

This is a great, easy recipe with endless variations.  Here's how I did mine:  I rinsed two chicken breasts, split them length-wise, placed them at the bottom of a le creuset French oven (it's all I have, but it worked just fine anyway), threw some minced garlic and fresh black pepper in there, layered ripped slices of Swiss cheese over the chicken, spread the condensed soup over it, poured about 1/3 cup of milk on top of that and then an equal amount of water on top of that before pouring a bag of stuffing on top. Then I left it in the oven covered for 40 minutes, removed the cover and poured a bit of melted butter over the stuffing, and let it cook for another 20 minutes. The stuffing cooks completely through without being dry, and while not excessively saucy, the chicken is moist and terrific with some plain rice and a side of grean beans. My boyfriend and I had enough for two dinners (it was even better the second day).  I would have added a little white wine with the water, but I didn't have any on hand.  Still, a yummy, easy, one dish meal, definitely worth trying.

This recipe turned out amazing. My family and friends love it!! They all want the recipe. I made a couple of changes however, I used more seasoing on the chicken breasts. I used salt, pepper, seasing salt, and garlic powder on both sides of the meat. I also put the one cup of bread crumbs inside the butter and then sprinkeled it evenly over the chicken. The chicken came out very moist. If I could give this recipe ten stars I would.

This was delicious but next time I make it I will mix the bread crumbs into the melted butter and then sprinkle it over.

My only change: I added a slice of proscuitto on top of each breast (under the Swiss). Turned out perfectly!

Very good. We don't like Swiss cheese so I used mozzarella instead. That was the only change I made. My family really enjoyed it.

Super easy and very yummy.  I made two pans of this recipe a few weeks ago.  We had one right away and froze the other.  On a busy night this week I cooked the frozen pan and it was just as good! This recipe will go in my rotation!

delicious! my boyfriend said "save this recipe!". I used a can of cream of chicken and of broccoli cheeses and mixed it up with sour cream. Then poured it over the chicken in an 8 by 8. I then put two slices of swiss and two slices of cheddar cheese over the chicken and topped it with stuffing mixed with melted butter. Baked it for 30 covered and 20 uncovered. couldnt have been better.

This was very good. I did alter just a couple of things based on personal preference. I had 3 large chicken breasts, so I placed them in an 8x8 pan. This solved the problem of others saying there wasn't enough sauce to cover. I seasoned them to our preference, and covered them with the soup mixture, then covered to bake at 375 for 30 min. Then, when I uncovered them, I topped them with 1/2 cup bread crumbs & 1/4 cup parmesan (in the green can) cheese mixed with 3 Tblsp melted butter to finish cooking uncovered. Very good, and SO easy!

Sometimes you something easy to make.  I read almost all of the reviews before making and this is what I did.  I layed chicken in 9x13 pan and seasoned both sides (most people said it needed more seasoning).  I used a little salt, freshly ground pepper, paprika, garlic powder and onion flakes.  Top with thinly slices of swiss cheese.  Mixed together two small cartons of organic cream of chicken soup with 1/2 cup of milk and poured over chicken to cover.  Covered and baked 40 minutes.  Mixed together 1 cup of panko bread crumbs with 4 tab of melted butter, and then sprinkled over chicken.  Sprinkled parmesean cheese over crumbs.  Baked uncovered another 20 minutes until lightly brown.  Rested 15 minutes and served over rice.  You could also serve over noodles or mashed potatoes.  Next time, I would use 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs.  The panko comes out really crunchy.  Some people used stuffing mix, but not a fan of this.  I used organic chicken, organic soup, organic milk and butter.  Very healthy dish.  Very easy.  Takes five minutes to put together and ready in an hour.  I served peas alongside too.  I do a lot of cooking, but sometimes  you need something easy and quick.  Everyone loved it.

Just a few substitutions...as always, I substitute any recipe for chicken breast with chicken thighs. Also--I'm bad, I know!!--I used 
whipping cream in place of milk. (BAD GIRL! LOL!) And doubled the butter--actually, more like tripled (where it comes to butter, color me Paula Deen...) it. Was REALLY amazing!!!! And no one even had a cardiac arrest afterwards, so also a plus! Overall, I LOVE this recipe!!! ???

Living in the southwest we used cream of poblano soup instead of the cream of chicken.  We also chose to use panko crumbs since we think it gives a better crunch. At the very end, we put it on broil for about 5 minutes to get a better crunch.

I did my own variation on this.  For one thing, I added salt as well as pepper.  I also quadrupled the sauce, using 2 cans of cream of chicken, one cream of mushroom and one cream of celery, with one cup of milk.  I submerged the chicken breasts in the mix and let them soak for about 2 hours.  I then put them in the dish, put the cheese on and poured the full load of sauce over them, skipping the bread crumbs.  Baked covered for about 20 minutes, then uncovered for another 20 minutes.  While it was baking, I made spaghetti and steamed some broccoli and cauliflower, and when the chicken came out, I put the sauce on the spaghetti.  I then placed the chicken breast on top of the spaghetti and arranged the steamed veggies around the edge of the plate.  To say it was a big hit with my family would be putting it very mildly!

Not bad, I read some reviews and made some changes.  Used 2 lg cans of cr of mush soup and some milk to make extra sauce and served with egg noodles.  Also used the stuffing instead of bread crumbs and doubled the cheese.  Hard to tell if the chicken was done because it was smothered.  Not bad though.  Oh, also seasoned the chicken with onion salt, pepper and minced garlic.

I have  made this recipe for years and it is so an easy and delicious  for company. I serve it with rice so I use 2 cans of soup for extra sauce. I use chardonnay in place of milk and a box of Stove-top stuffing(dry),instead of breadcrumbs.  These changes put this recipe over the top taste wise.

This is a delicious, company-worthy dish. A half-cup or so of white zinfandel, stirred into the chicken soup mixture, is a tasty addition.

This is THE BEST chicken recipe I've ever eaten in my LIFE! I tried it out thinking it would be pretty dang good but OH MY! The taste is HEAVENLY!! I would suggest adding 2 pieces of swiss cheese to each breast instead of just 1 though. and I even added a 3rd after it was done baking because most of it melted off the breasts. If i could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!! You have to try this at least once!

I made this last night for 3 teenage boys and my husband.  Everyone LOVED it!!  I had to make a few changes because I was lacking a few ingredients.  I decided to use two cans of cream of chicken soup after reading the reviews.  I did not have two cans, so I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of fat free cream of mushroom, and I doubled the milk it called for.  I also did not have any bread crumbs on hand, so I used some Ritz crackers I had.  I just crumbled them up really fine and sprinkled them on top.  I will be making this again, but I don't think I will ever try it with the bread crumbs.  The crackers on top were delicious!!!  This is a keeper!!

This was excellent!  My husband and his 91 year old Dad loved it.  I'll definitely be making it again.  I loaded shredded Cheddar and Mexican cheese onto each breast.  I had mixed cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups and poured it over the chicken.  Sprinkled lots of bread crumbs and drizzled melted butter over everything and it was the most delicious and tender we have had in a long time.  No knives needed.  This is definitely a recipe we will be making over and over.

This dish was out of this world!  I used three large skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I made up a rub using Montreal Chicken seasoning, garlic powder, dried basil, and ground red pepper. I gave my chicken breasts a front and back rub to really give them a generous coat of spice.  To each breast, I layered with two slices of Pepper Jack cheese. My soup mixture contained two cans Cream of Chicken and a 1/2 cup of white whine whisked in.  I omitted the milk in favor of the wine.  After covering with mushrooms and smothering with soup, I topped it all off with cornbread stuffing drizzled with the butter.  Whooooo Buddy!  What a heavenly taste.  And, it caused my loco gato to do a backward somersault.  I served it with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.

Oh this was gorgeous!    I don't write many reviews.   But I needed something quick and easy.

I used sharp cheddar and a bit of mozzarella and exchanged the breadcrumbs for Ritz crackers.     I used cream of chicken,   and golden mushroom soup.

It was so easy,  so quick,   and so delicious.

Definitely one to keep!

good and simple, great "safe" meal for a beginner cook too.   If you like the flavor of french fried onions, top it with 1/2 cup or so of them just as the dish comes out of the oven.  It makes for a very flavorful addition.  I made it with the suggested two different soups, I kept the swiss and I also added several squeezes of fresh lemon juice to pull all the flavors together.  Tasty!

I love this recipe. Its only me and my husband so I only use two chicken breasts, remove the skin, season them with garlic powder and poultry season, use procutto and swiss cheese and I use white wine instead of milk. I use crackers instead of bread crumbs because thats what I usually have around. This comes out tasty and just the right amount of gravy for both chicken and rice. I will most certainly make this recipe often.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I read the reviews and changed a few things.  First, I used 2 chicken breasts as there are only 2 of us.  I seasoned the chicken with a no-salt seasoning (Mural of Flavor from Penzey's), garlic salt and black pepper.  I used about 1 cup of sliced mushrooms over the chicken before the cheese.  I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and about 2/3 C. sour cream blended well with 1/4 C. white wine.  I topped it with a combination of Italian flavored bread crumbs and Fried Onion Rings (the kind you put over green bean casserole) - I pulsed them in the food processor to combine and chop the onions, then sprinkled them over the top, covered and put it in the oven.  I served it with steamed rice and Lemon-garlic-buttered broccoli.  This was good! (not a 5 star, that's reserved for only the best) but still, a keeper.  Thanks, Leagle, for a great recipe.

The first time I made it, I thought, "Good, but could use a few added enhancements".  - The second time I made it, I used Mrs Dash, and I pounded the chicken first to avoid it being dry. Also added a fresh clove of chopped garlic and a handful of chopped mushrooms before adding the cream of chicken soup.  I also added a 1/4 c. water to the soup mix.  I used panko bread crumbs and thought they were tasty :) Overall, a great basic recipe! Thanks

I have made this about 3 different times already and my husband, kids, teenager's girlfriend(who's usually a  picky eater) and I love the recipe just the way it's written.  Chicken comes out moist and flavourful everytime.  Thank you!  I'm going to try the variations suggested by others just for fun.

Wow this has a lot of reviews! I know people get mad when you change the recipe but, I think your a good chef when you use what you have on hand and still make it taste good. This is an excellent recipe you could do so much with. I had 3 large chicken breast that I cut in half, used Monterrey Jack cheese (its what I had) added 1 can of mild chopped green chili to the cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I seasoned the breasts with poultry seasoning, garlic and tad bit of cumin, put the shredded Jack on top and then poured the soups with the green chili over the breasts, last went the bread crumbs. It was deliciousss..... with a hint of mexican flair. I did have to bake it longer than it said.

Made it twice so far.  First time used chicken breast and second time used chicken leg quarters (more time in the oven), both were super yummy!!!  I did take someone's advise to generally sprinkle garlic powder and onion powder with black pepper and salt, I also sprinkled salt free Mrs. Dash original blend seasoning.  Both times I used cream of mushroom and chicken soup.  I also sprinkled shredded parmesan cheese on the chicken for the last 5 minutes.  will definitely make this again and again!

My picky husband loved it, but my kids didn't like it at all. It didn't think it was horrible, but I didnt think it was that great, not alot of flavor. It does have some potential though. Not enough sauce, I think I would add more milk. I didnt taste the cheese. I used shredded swiss because that was all I had, so maybe that's why. I also thought it had too much bread crumbs. The breadcrumbs pretty much just turned into a soggy mush (I mixed the butter w/the breadcrumbs before putting it on). I also had to cook it about 20 mins longer than what the directions said. I probably will try this again since my husband liked it so much. I will do it a little different next time though.

GREAT recipe! If you're looking for a super quick, easy, absolutely delicious dinner that'll win over all your family & friends, this is your best bet!!! I've modified the recipe plenty of times using munster cheese, colby jack shredded cheese, ect instead of swiss. I've also done it where I've added frozen veggies & green onions. LOVE IT! Such a great find :)

Loved this recipe! A super easy and low cost meal that tastes wonderful! I love that you can add your favorite cheese, or use cornflake crumbs as a delicious option! One of those recipes that has ingredients that are usually always in your kitchen! (And to make it with a few less calories and fat, opt for reduced fat cheese and fat free milk! I did! And it was great)!

This recipe lived up to everyone's positive review. Most notable is the moistness of the chicken. I also appreciate the creative possibilities in the ingredients. Here are my variations: I used low fat cream of chicken soup. I seasoned chicken with pepper,oinion and garlic powder. Instead of milk I used       white wine. I also mixed some dried green 
and red bell pepper into the soup. I served over a bed of Orzo with whole green beans on the side...quick,easy,  excellent!

I was apprehensive to try this recipe.  It looked way too simple and bland to be anything good...but I was TOTALLY WRONG.  It's amazing how such a simple mix of basic ingredients was so delicious!  I make my own croutons at home, and as another person suggested here substituted croutons for the crackers.  Simply amazing...thank you for a great recipe

BOOM!  This was toooooo good!  I seasoned the breasts first with onion and garlic powder, as well as poultry seasoning.  I used fresh, smoked swiss from the deli and used a little over an ounce (about a slice and a half) per breast.  I used a 1/2 cup of evaporated milk with 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I like a lot of "gravy" and this was plenty!  For the topping, I used one whole box of stuffing.  Now, the stuffing wasn't as "done" as I had expected it to be, but I didn't care that it was a little mushy.  The flavor of this dish was outstanding.  Perhaps I should I have broiled it for a few minutes at the end?  I served with fresh, steamed broccoli.  I can't wait to make this again.  I will be adding fresh mushrooms next time around!

this is delicious. More snow in the midwest had me scrambling for something to make without going to the store.  This was so easy and flavourful.  On low carb this week. so does anyone have suggestions as to what to pair it with other than potatoes  rice or noodles.Yum

This was so easy and delicious!  I actually used shredded swiss, Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup and added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I used 2 slices of Nature's Own Honey Wheat bread I had on hand to make the bread crumbs.  Served atop fettucine!  Excellent!!!  First word out of my 7 year old daughter's mouth was "YUMMY"!

This was a delicious dinner idea!  I used some of the suggestions of others when making the sauce.  I used 1/2 C. milk and two cans of Cream of Chicken soup.  I also seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic salt before topping with the mixture of milk & soup.  I would think anything less, wouldn't be enough sauce!  I used bread crumbs as stated in the recipe and thought this was a yummy dinner...my whole family enjoyed it!  I made fettuccine and served the chicken mixture ontop...very good!!

Everyone raved about this one, even my pickyune 6 year old grand son who exclaimed, "This is the best chicken I've ever had!" My husband and I couldn't believe our ears.  I seasoned the chicken with a little sprinkling of garlic powder and fine herbs along with the pepper, doubled the sauce ingredients and used Panko bread crumbs mixed thoroughly with the butter.  They didn't know they were eating Swiss cheese because I didn't tell them.  Sometime when it's just my husband and myself I'd like to try the suggestion of using a little splash of white wine.  Thanks for this miracle recipe that even my grandkids like.

This is my "picky" child's all-time favorite chicken recipe and she requests it often. I probably make it at least 3 times a month!  I follow the recipe exactly except use low sodium soup and lowfat cheese.  It doesn't affect the taste. YUMMY!  Thanks for a family favorite!

I liked it this way okay.  I pumped it up a bit the second time by replacing the milk with 1/4 cup of dry sherry, and replaced the bread crumbs with dry stuffing mix.  DELISH!! Four stars as is, five stars with my replacements.

Really tasty recipe!  I would have given it five stars except the chicken needs to be seasoned better. Knowing this ahead, I seasoned with Adobo seasoning and Garlic Powder and the chicken came out great.  My husband loved it! oh,  I followed the advice of others and put the bread crumbs in the melted butter.made the top nice and crunchy. will def try stove top on top next time instead of the bread crumbs.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  My husband raves about it everytime I make it!  I like to use sliced pepperjack chees for a little kick.

Loved the ease and the flavor of this but for some reason the chicken was a little rubbery. Next time I'll pound them a little before seasoning and baking. Oh - also added a little garlic powder with the pepper, used seasoned bread crumbs, and took the advice of another rater and them with the melted butter before sprinkling on top.

Great and easy to fix meal.  I did use 2 cans soup vs what recipe called for, one can cream of mushroom, and one can of cream of chicken, it turned out great. Will make again.

Make sure to really use the appropriate amount of everything. I halved the chicken and everything but the soup (didn't want to waist). There was too much soup and not enough bread crumbs to make up for it. Had to bake longer because of this, too. Still, really good!

I made this dish tonight for dinner and it was great! I was sure to season my chicken breasts well before adding the cheese topping. I also used sour cream instead of milk. I used Provolone cheese, Stove top stuffing for chicken, and like others, 1 can each of cream of mushroom and chicken soup. I buttered the stuffing mix before topping the dish.  It was easy, quick and delicious. A perfect recipe for working women with hungry families to feed in a hurry. Thanks for sharing

This was pretty good.  I made small pieces of chicken instead of large breasts and only cooked it for 25 minutes or so uncovered.  I would be curious to try it with more seasonings on the chicken or in the crumbs as it was very bland, but sometimes bland is fine.

I made this even easier. I coated the chicken with garlic powder, pepper and poultry seasoning.   I used shredded Mexican style cheese and just spread it all over the chicken.  I also used evaporated milk and Cream of Mushroom soup and added 1/4 cup of dry white wine to the soup mixture.  I also used Ritz cracker crumbs.  It was scrumptious.

After reading other reviews, I made a few changes.  Seasoned the chicken both sides with ground pepper, garlic salt, and paprika.  Put two slices of swiss on each piece of chicken, low-fat cream of mushroom soup, milk, can of mushroom pieces, and buttered bread crumbs from the skillet.  Yum, yum, yum!  Will make again and again.

I had forgot about this recipe. It's really good! Even my kids said it was okay, which is high praise from them! I made a few changes. First of all, Campbell's has a Cream of Chicken & Mushroom Soup, which added extra flavor. When the dish is just about done I add a few ounces of beer (any kind). The alcohol cooks off and it adds a great flavor. This dish is also versatile and can be served with mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.

This was really good. I like simple recipes. I prepared it and stuck in the fridge until I got home and just slide it in the oven. I didn't have swiss so I used cheddar and my children devoured it. GOLD STAR for LEAGLE!

I actually used a similar recipe on here called Swiss Chicken or something.  Here's how I did it:  Had 4 breasts, but based on a couple of comments on the other recipe, split breasts in half thickness wise.  Put into my 13 x 9 pan; mixed can of cream of chicken with some white wine (had it on hand) and milk, poured over the chicken, which I lightly sprinkled with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and pepper, covered that with several slices Swiss cheese to use it up, topped with Pepperidge Farm Herb stuffing mix and panko bread crumbs mixed with some butter.  OMG!  We loved it!  What I'll do differently next time is use 2 cans of the soup and liquid just to have more sauce.  Also, will top with the stuffing/bread crumbs then just pour the butter over.  I don't like packaged foods much, but do use cream soups often, and I can tell you from someone who turns up their nose at cake mixes and many processed foods, this stuff is so, so good!

With changes I can give this 4 stars. I butterflied the chicken stuffed and rolled sliced block cheese on the inside not the individually wrapped kind, dipped in butter with seasonings(use your faves) and then the bread crumbs instead of pouring butter over the top.

I dont know how you cooked it in 50 minutes cause Mine took about 2-3 hrs at 350.  I did it twice, 50 min at 350, 20 min at 500 and 1hr or so at 350 again..The chicken was very juicy and delicious.  I put 2-3 slices of cheese on each breast, and mixed the crumbs with the butter plus added bacon bits on top....Delicious

I made this with Cream of Mushroom (didn't have Cream of Chicken on hand) and panko bread crumbs.  This was really good!  I had massive chicken breasts which, next time if they're so big, I'll cut in half longways.  Still, the end result was moist and everybody really liked this.

It was a little salty for our taste.  I followed directions exactly and didn't care for it much.  Besides being salty it was too greasy from the buttery bread crumbs and cheese.  I would use a different soup base too because it was "too chickeny" according to my husband.  Maybe cream of celery or mushroom?  Probably won't make this again.

Simply awesome. I was looking for an easy chicken dish that would impress and taste like I spent hours without the effort and this is it! It is perfect. I've made this a couple of times and everytime people inquire about how good this is.

I didn't really enjoy this, but it's most likely my fault.  I pared it down to two servings, for my husband and I.  I added a few french fried onions to the top and a little touch of white wine to the sauce.  After the full 50 minutes, I was horrified to see my husband's chicken was still raw!  I had to put them back in and up the temp to 400 for another 15 minutes.  Perhaps the chicken breasts were abnormally large, but they didn't appear to be, to me.  It was very puzzling.  In spite of the undercooking mishap, I didn't really enjoy all the flavors together.  I think I am just coded to want turkey if I taste stuffing.  :)  It might be better if I use solely the french fried onions.  But I doubt that I will be making this again.  Thank you, though, I always enjoy making a new recipe!!

DE-LISH!! Very very good recipe!! I changed the cooking times though, I browned the chicken in a skillet with a little bit of ex-virgin olive oil, and sesoned with Seasoning Salt and garlic powder, then I baked in the the for 30 mins on 375. The chicken was very moist, and the swiss combined with the soup was outstanding. I am going to make this all the time!! UPDATE: I tried this with Cream of chicken and herbs soup... outstanding!!

This was the best thing I've had in a while.  So yummy...the chicken was very moist and juicy...the sauce was so creamy and rich along with the cheese.  My husband comment that he liked the buttery bread crumbs.  I will certainly be making this again very soon.

This dish was awesome!  I lightened it up by using Campbells's Healthy Cream of Chicken Soup, 1% milk, Smart Balance Light (instead of butter) and reduced fat swiss cheese.  I used some garlic and herbs in the soup mixture... YUMMY!  So easy... I will definitely make again.

This was so wonderful! I had to make a few changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I used shredded Cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, and crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I then added some canned mushroom to the sauce. This chicken turned out so tender, I could cut it with a fork. Wonderful recipe! Thanks so much.

Very good easy recipe.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead and put a slice of ham on top, to make it like chicken cordon bleu.   My husband and I loved it!!

This was awesome!  I changed the portions just a tad, I did not have time to de-bone the chicken breasts and I needed 6 of them.  I just doubled the other ingredients, increased the baking time by 20 minutes and it was perfect.  I will make this often, especially on rainy days!

I made this recipe tonight, with a couple of variations:  I used chicken tenders (uncooked boneless/skinless chicken breasts pre-sliced into strips); I sprinkled the chicken with dried onions, garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning mix; Velveeta cheese; 1/2 cup of half and half instead of the milk; cream of mushroom soup.  It came out great!  I can never get my daughter to eat all of her meal, but she slurped this one down in minutes and enthusiastically said she wanted me to make it again.  Another reviewer said that using the tenders resulted in dry chicken, but mine came out perfect.  Also, although I used regular half-and-half this time, I've used fat-free half-and-half in many, many other recipes before and would imagine that it'd be great in this one as well.  Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much)!

This was very, very good!!  I took other people's suggestion and used seasoned stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs and I think it made it taste a lot better. I also combined the stuffing mix with the butter before sprinkling it over the chicken.

I followed previous suggestions when making this and was pleased.  I scaled the recipe to 2, and instead of using 1/2 can I used 1 whole can ( chicken with herbs) and 3/4 can (1/2) half and half and(1/2) water. Prior to adding the soup mixture, I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried parsley over the chicken, then partially melted the cheese over the chicken in a warm oven. With the bread crumbs I did not measure, I simply sprinkled them over the top to cover. Following the cooking directions, I did lose a small amount of bread crumbs but just srpinkled more ( did not make sauce too thick), however I had to allow an extra 15-20 mins to get my chicken to 180 degrees.  Oh yes and I used 2 slices of cheese per piece of chicken. After a lil "doctoring up" this recipe is well worth 5 stars  (4 stars as is though ) considering the ease of preparation and the very small mess to clean up :) Thanks Lori

What a great recipe!! It was so easy to
prepare, and I had all the ingredients
in my cupboard! The taste was absolutely
spectacular, and I'm sure this will now
be a regular feature in our weekly menu!
P.S. I used low fat cheese and soup, and
it still tasted great.

Great.  Easy.  Modified recipe because I was short on time.  Broiled the chicken breast with pepper until it was just cooked through, be sure to flip the chicken. (12 min).  While chicken is cooking, I warmed up the chx soup/milk sauce in pot. When the chicken is cooked, put the cheese on, poured the chx soup/milk sauce and topped with herbed panko crumbs.  Back in the broiler for 7 minutes.   Served with white rice and broccoli.  Skipped the butter - it doesn't need it.

I also lined the pan with foil for easy clean up.

Yummy!

I will definitely be adding this the rotation. Great reviews from family and it was easy to make. My only issue was not enough breading because it slid off during the baking process. I just added a bit more bread crumb mixture  when I took the cover off before the final 20 minute baking and that fixed it.

I love this recipe and plan to make it again.  I would also make it for company.  I did substitute cream of mushroom soup only because it was what I had on hand.  Same with using combo jack & cheddar cheese and seasoned bread crumbs.   I can't wait to make this again using the recipe as is,  and then using some suggestions I read in reviews.  This way it will always be great but just a little different.

This was pretty bland to us. However the chicken was super moist. I did add some seasoning to the chicken but it wasn't enough.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  This is now my all-time favorite chicken dinner recipe.  The chicken was delicious and moist while the stuffing gave the meal a bit of crunch.  I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers and used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup instead of 1 can so there was enough sauce to cover the chicken.  I also used 1 cup of milk instead of a ¼ cup and used 1 box of chicken flavored Stove Top Stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.  It was a tiny bit too salty so I’m going to try the low sodium soup and low sodium stuffing next time to see if that helps.  Clean-up was a snap too with only one bowl and one dish to wash.  I am a novice cook and found this recipe very easy to make.  I’d strongly encourage other novice cooks to try it.

I really thought my family would be pleased. A nice hot chicken dish with creamy sauce but instead I got no response. Not even a thanks for the meal,so I will have to pass on this one. Nothing special to report.
The search continues for food with piazza .

I have been making this recipe for years but mine is a little different. Instead of the milk I use white wine and for the bread crumbs I use an herbal stuffing on top. My family loves this dish.

Simple, tasty, and easy!  My only recommendation is to double the melted margarine/butter so that more of the bread crumbs were crispy.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. Delicious and super easy. I did take a other reviewers recommendation and also sprinkled Season-All and garlic powder lightly on the chicken.  I did add a tad more milk because I wanted then chicken soup a little creamer, but not sure if it did anything!! Also some one suggested mixing the bread crumbs, (I used Panko crumbs since that's all I had) with the butter and them drizzled it over the chicken. Wonderful!!!

I thought that this recipe was just ok. I followed it as recommended, but added season salt to the chicken before cooking and used cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken soup. My only complain was that this was ridiculously thick and rich and incredibly salty. I would definitely not add anymore salt to it next time, and would probably even use a low sodium soup next time. 

We served the extra gravy over garlic mashed potatoes and it was really delish.

Thanks!

This very good recipe can be made a little tastier if you use Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mix (blue package) rather than bread crumbs. I don't think cream of mushroom soup compliments the dish as well as the cream of chicken soup. Of course, it's all a matter of taste preference. I also just spread a can (or 2) of cream of chicken soup over the Swiss cheese rather than diluting it with milk.  It makes for a creamier "gravy."  Either way, it's a great dish.  Thanks for the posting.

Haven't made it per se (this is real similar to the recipe on the Stove Top box), but I totally agree with Cdabis.

Please don't rate these recipes unless you have tried them as posted.

I love this recipe. Call it swiss chicken bake, and there is never anyone who complains about the "mouse cheese". Obviously, they don't even know it's in there. For personal preference, I have always cut the bread crumbs down to 1/2 Cup, I also use Italian Bread Crumbs for that little extra flavor. I omit the milk, and use either white wine or water. Either one works well, and this is an awesome dish.

Have made this recipe for years. Known as Sandy's Chicken at my house in honor of the lovely lady who shared the recipe with me.Only change is the original calls for Pepridge Farms seasoned stuffing crumbs....gives it a bit more flavor. A definite go to recipe. Delicious!

This was so quick and easy and YUMMY!! I used cheddar and also a "mexican style cheese mix" as well as adding cooked bacon bits and some chopped onion! Came out FAB!!! I made stove top stuffing chicken flavor, once the chicken was out of the oven I served stuffing and placed the chicken over the stuffing.  It was SOOO yummy and filling.  All kids and hubby ate it and asked for more! A new fav epescially if you are in a bit of a hurry.

Fantastic!!! Modified it a little by adding 1 can of Swansons low sodium chicken broth and added more stuffing on top of chicken. It takes longer to cook as you have more liquid but it tastes great! I kept all other ingredients the same. ( I used Pepperidge Farms stuffing instead of bread crumbs).

Very moist and tender.  I, like other reviewers seasoned the chicken prior to placing the cheese on.  I did, however, use too much poultry seasoning.  It was a little too Thanksgivingy.

I was skeptical but this turned out great. I did use two cans of soup and seasoned the chicken my own way.

Not a fan. Should have went with my gut, but with all the good reviews I figured I would give it a shot. If you're into more complex flavors, don't even bother. Two stars only because it was easy. I hate leaving bad reviews, but we will not be making this again; sorry!

We did not like this at all. I made it because I had all the ingredients on hand. Too creamy or salty or something. Basically just tasted like chicken with soup on top to me. But judging from the reviews, many people really love it! Different strokes I guess. Thanks for the chance to try it though!

The Swiss cheese was strong for our liking.  I should have gone with provolone or muenster.  Otherwise it's a keeper.

I followed this recipe exactly, and no one liked it. The bread crumbs became completely mushy. I bet it would have been better if it were topped with croutons, or any course bread crumb. At least the chicken was still moist after scraping off the topping.

I can't believe something so simple is so good. I substituted provalone cheese for the swiss and used ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.
It was easy and very good!

This recipe was delicious, the things I did differently was to pepper both sides of the breast and add a bit of minced garlic, as well as add an additional 1/3 cup of water which I poured over the breasts with the soup and milk. The meat was juicy and, with the excess  sauce, I made noodles to go with it. Thanks for all the tips! 

I also tried my hand at a condensed tomato soup, cheddar cheese chicken breast with the same approach. It was pretty good too, but not as good as the original version I think.

After work, traffic and the endless daily rushing around, this recipe is so simple and quick!  We have a house full of college football sons and nephews that not only eat a lot but eat late so I can quickly pop chicken in a 2nd time in a day if I need to.  Our only changes are provolone cheese, add garlic powder to the soup, an entire stick of melted butter drizzled on top per pan and less bread crumbs.  We serve with a hot pot of sticky rice and tossed salad.  Easy for the boys to warm up the next day...and get this, they even learned to make it themselves. Hallelujah.

I thought this recipe was great, although I made some changes. But that is just my style, I change every recipe. I added diced onions and garlic to the creamy mixture. I also used 8 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese instead of Swiss. I seasoned the chicken breast with Lawry's season salt & fresh ground pepper before topping it also. This came out very good. I also followed other suggestions and mixed the bread crumbs and butter before putting it on the chicken. TIP: Crush bread crumbs if you do not have store bought ones.

Hubby thought this was too bland even though I sprinkled some garlic powder and Italian seasoning on top.  Next time will have to season both sides of chicken breast and try to jazz it up a little more. Overall a good, easy dish though. Served mine with egg noodles. Made 7 breasts in an extra large pan, doubled the chicken soup part and there was plenty of sauce, would have been way too much for only 4 breasts, that is for sure.

I seasoned the chicken w/ Adobo, pepper & garlic powder.  I made more chicken breasts than the recipe called for so I used 2 cans of soup (1 cream of mushroom & 1 cream of chicken) & used about a 1/2 of a soup can of milk--it was a little too much sauce, but not bad.  I added mushrooms & topped w/ french fried onions.  All in all, a good recipe!

This was good.  i used only 2 bone-in skin on breasts but same amounts of everything else.  The sauce was rather thick and wasn't enough so I couldn't imagine this with 4 breasts.  Will just thin out next time or double.  Added some mushrooms too.  This one is worth making again!

I give this 5 stars for ease and versatilty. So good, i made this with provolone and cornflakes mixed in the 3 tbs of butter since i didnt have swiss or breadcrumbs. I like and prefer the other ingredients but didnt have them on hand...will try several variations of soups and toppings. Thanks for a great weeknight recipe.

Been cooking for 20 yrs.  Followed directions methodically.  Dish came out slimy with all the bread crumbs in the pool of cream at the bottom.  Oh yeah one other thing.  You may want to add some cooking time for chicken breasts that are larger then a cassette tape.

Based on the reviews, I also added garlic powder on the chicken breasts, used 1/2 cup of 2% milk, 1 can of cream of chicken, and used Stove Top instead of breadcrumbs.  In addition, I used white american cheese and added a little dijon mustard to the soup mixture.  Delicious!

This chicken recipe is one of the easiest and tastiest I've ever tried. I modified it for what I had on hand. Used Season All, fresh ground pepper, & garlic. Didn't have any Swiss, but had bagged cheese, so I sprinkled the chicken with finely shredded blend of cheddar and Monterey jack. Used cream of mushroom soup and sprinkled Panko bread crumbs lightly on top. Didn't use any melted butter. I was serving 6, so I baked it covered for 40 minutes, then uncovered for 20 minutes more. The chicken was moist, fork-tender, and delicious! Will definitely be making this often. Thank you LEAGLE for sharing your recipe.

Was a big hit in our house. I used some ideas from other ratings and added some of my own. I sprinkled both sides of my chicken with chicken rub and cut them into strips. I used cream of chicken soup and a half can water with half can white wine. Used box of chicken flavored stuffing mixed with 6 T butter to sprinkle over top. Came out great!! I'm thinking next time of adding some sliced water chestnuts for some crunch.

One of our favorite meals. I've been making it for years (got it from a friend) and everytime someone new tastes it they rave. I also use stove top instead of bread crumbs.

This Recipe came out really good.  I was tired of the same old chicken, tried this and everyone loved it.  I used stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and chicken rub instead of pepper ... adding more flavor.

this chicken is amazing!  everytime i make it for my fiance' he gets so excited!  Instead of using swiss cheese, I use cheddar cheese and I also sautee onions and add it to the dish.  I serve the chicken over rice.  Im making it for my dad tonight for the first time, and he's a very picky eater.  I'm not worried though because I know this dish is a hit!

Excellent dish! I made it using two large chicken breasts, cut into smaller pieces, arranged in an 8x11 pan and seasoned with black pepper, seasoning salt, sea salt, onion powder and garlic powder. A few frozen veggies were then tossed in, and slices of swiss and provolone were added. Instead of breadcrumbs, I used stovetop chicken-flavored stuffing mix, fixed according to the package instructions, which was then dished in in part. For soup, I used Campbell's cream of chicken and cream of mushroom combo can (condensed) and mixed with .5-cup of milk. Pour that in and top with the remaining stuffing. Cooked for 40 minutes covered at 350, then 20 or so minutes uncovered. Came out sufficiently moist and tasty. So easy to prepare! :)

This was an awesome dish!  My kids absolutely loved it and it was very easy.  I did add some of the ideas from others, like a slice of ham then cheese on top, and fresh mushrooms to the soup mix.  Delicious!

I love this recipe.  It's so easy and very tasty.  I modified it a bit by adding a bit of salt with the pepper, using American cheese instead of Swiss, reducing the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken.  I also use 5, 1/2 chicken breasts instead of 4.  My family loves it!  Thank you!

I'm always trying new chicken recipes. This was pretty good. However, I added some spanish Sazon Goya seasoning, which is why my version has an orange color to it.  Delicious as prepared.

This is very good but has way to much bread crumbs. If I make it again I would use maybe 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. It is very similar to Swiss Chicken Casserole II which is much better even made with bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix.

This was good, I used oyster crackers (put in my word processor to grind up) and I used Cheddar Cheese instead of swiss.  Kids loved it, will make again.

Sorry,
Boring as written.  I love good chicken, and this was way below "good eats".  Tasted like the first chicken breast recipe someone cooked before they learned how to cook.  Boring.  Sorry, gave it a try, but no way will I save this one.

This was really good.  I was a bit worried that it wouldnt have enough flavor so I did make a couple changes.  First I used provolone cheese as I didn't have swiss.  I placed a slice of cooked bacon on the chicken before topping with the cheese.  I also used crushed Cornbread stuffing mixed which I added italian seasoning to before topping.  This was very juicy and flavorful.  The only thing I will do differently is I will cut the chicken down and cook it more like a cassarole next time.  The whole breasts were hard to cut while keeping the topping on them.

I found this recipe in a Gooseberry Patch cookbook and fell in love! Instead of regular bread crumbs I used dry stovetop stuffing mix, something about the extra spices made it absolutely delicious!! VERY GOOD and my boyfriend keeps requesting it :)

Great recipe - I broiled it for a couple mintues at the end to add a little crispyness to the breadcrumbs. Also mixed the butter with the breadcrumbs before putting on the chicken.

This is my boyfriend's favorite dish! Sometimes I substitute a 1/4cup good dry wine for the milk, it makes the sauce more tangy. I also switch up the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom. I use crushed StoveTop for the topping and I reduce the butter to drizzle on top.

Great recipes and easy to prep!  I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand and also added sliced fresh mushrooms.  My husband said it was excellent and enjoyed it even more as leftovers on day two!  He requested that I make this one again.

This recipe initially sounded like it would be rather bland, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it and I'm glad I did.  I was completely surprised at how good this was.  With all due respect to the originator of the recipe, I made a few changes. I liberally seasoned the chicken with sage, thyme, paprika, rosemary, salt and marjoram. (Without the strong seasoning, it might have been a little bland.) I used Campbell's "Healthy Request" cream of chicken soup and "skim plus" milk to cut fat. Finally, I substituted herb seasoned stuffing, crushed, for the breadcrumbs, and mixed the stuffing crumbs with the butter before topping the chicken. The recipe came out incredibly flavorful and juicy and the stuffing topping was crunchy and delicious. This was a bit hit with the family. Oh yeah - and this recipe was really FAST and not that messy to prepare. Thanks!

LOVED IT !!!!!!!  I took suggestions of several others- sharp Cheddar cheese, garlic salt, crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers, and mushroom soup.  Excellent!!  The only thing I will change will be garlic powder instead of garlic salt it was a tad bit too salty.

The only addition I made was adding garlic powder when adding the pepper. This is easy to make and works well over noodles or rice. It deserves 5 stars because you don't spend forever in the kitchen and it tastes good.

Loved it!  So good.. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans with home made potatoe bread.  The sauce was great over the potatoes and the chicken was very moist.  The only thing I did different was I used Cambells, healthy request reduced sodium soup. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very flavorful and tastey. I did not add the butter on top or use all of the bread crumbs, but it came out great!

The chicken was delicious and very moist.  I loved the taste of the swiss cheese.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't get much sauce with this recipe.  I followed it exactly and the sauce was very thick and I had to use a spatula to scrape it off the pan in some spots.  I will use more milk or liquid next time.

I love this recipe!  It was savory, indeed.  I followed recipe exactly except used chicken tenderloins and only had to cook for 25 minutes.  Flavors seemed to melt nicely and was just melt in your mouth delicious.  I also sprinkled some parmesan on top with the bread crumbs and used extra swiss.  Thanks!

My family LOVES this recipe, and so do I- It's easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I make liberal use of grated swiss cheese instead of using the slices and it turns out great every time.  The chicken is sooo tender.  Thanks, Lori!

I'm changing my rating from a 3 to a 4!  Made this again last night and tried it with the cream of chicken WITH HERBS soup instead and it made a huge difference.  I also seasoned the breasts with a dash of seasoning salt, paprika, garlic, and parsly prior to adding the cheese.  We used two breasts but kept the sauce at the given measurements.  I made mashed potatoes and used the "gravy" from this dish to pool into the potatoes... REALLY good with them!  We'll be making this comfort food again.

Delicious!  I didn't have Swiss cheese, so used Velveeta instead and was out of dried bread crumbs, so substituted oatmeal on top.  I made a fried rice almondine on the side and served the chicken over the rice...yummy!

This was a big hit at our house! I used Muenster cheese(2 slices per breast)instead of swiss and I mixed the bread crumbs with melted butter as others suggested previously. I also topped it all with Durkee Fried Onions. It went well with rice and a salad. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because the chicken was moist and tastey. I don't know what I did wrong, but the bread crumbs just fell off the chicken and into the gravy. This made the gravy very thick so there was nothing to put over the chicken or to serve over potatoes. I sprinkled the black pepper over the breasts and then I sprinkled some garlic powder over that. I used cream of chicken soup with herbs and added a bit more milk to the soup. I also used Italian bread crumbs. I will make this again making minor adjustments to the recipe. I will still use the soup with the herbs, but I will use 2 cans instead of one. I will also add more milk to the soups.I want more gravy to serve over the chicken and either potatoes or rice.  I will increase the cheese slices and omit the bread crumbs and butter.

This was a great recipe!!  My 3 girls, ages 7,5, and 3 1/2 who are very picky eaters even loved it.  I substituted mozzarella cheese for the swiss because that is what I had on hand.  I served the gravy over rice for my husband and I and it was wonderful!!  I saved this one and will be making it again.  It was VERY EASY!

I thought it was great, the chicken was so so juicy.  I did add extra swiss chesse and it worked out great.  The recipe does create a lot of sauce that would be great on potatoes or rice.
YUMMY!

The bread crumbs were soggy. There was hardly any flavor. It was like eating plain chicken breasts. I won't make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe. My Sorority served this for 75 people at our Founders Day dinner in April of 2000 and it was a BIG hit.  It's also really good used with seasoned stuffing mix.

This recipe is soooo easy.  I used cream of mushroom soup because that's what was in my cupboard and it turned out great.  I used seasoned croutons for the topping instead of breadcrumbs.  The sauce is great served over rice.  I'll be making this regularly for my family!

This dish was really good!  I made a few changes...I didn't have swiss cheese so used cheddar instead, sprinkled 1/2  teaspoon of garlic powder and juice from 1/2 lemon over chicken, mixed soup with 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup milk to pour over chicken.  Topped it with a package of chicken dressing mix.  Yummy...A keeper.

This recipe has been in my family for as long as I've been alive (48 yrs.)  The only difference is we use 1/4 cup of white wine instead of the milk and we use pepperidge farm stuffing (blue bag) instead of the bread crumbs.  Just adds extra flavor!!

I should start by saying that when it comes to chicken breast - the word dry always comes to mind.  These were so moist, tender and tasty. As the days go by they get even better. The recipe is simple yet amazingly tasty. Thank you - this was delicious!!

Second time making this dish and it is just as yummy! I followed other suggestions - I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder. I added provolone cheese and shredded mozzarella on top of chicken. I used 3 cans of soup, as we wanted extra gravy for the side of garlic mashed potatoes. I used Stove Top stuffing mixed with French's Fried Onions and melted butter. Covered with foil and baked for 35 minutes, then removed foil and cooked another 15-20 minutes. It has definitely been added to the weekly meal rotation!

I made this recipe exactly as submitted. During the cooking, as the cheese melted and the sauce spread, the bread crumbs went with them. The chicken tasted great, but the resulting sauce was thick with cheese and bread crumbs. I will make the recipe again, but I will make some adaptations to try for a better result.

This is good but I think it could be made even better.  I cut back on the bread crumbs.  I think it need some celery and maybe some parsley.

Loved this recipe.  So tasty and easy to make.  The only extra thing I did was seasoned the chicken breast with some garlic powder and onion flakes.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a T.  My husband and 5yr old daughter both liked it as well as I was told this was a keeper.

This has always been one of my favorite recipes growing up. My mom always used pepper jack cheese, though, which I didn't care for. I use whatever cheese I have on hand. So good!

Delicious!  I only had bone-in breasts so I cook it in total for an hour.  I also used two cans of soup and 1/2 cup of milk (cream of chicken and cream of mushroom).  Finally, I mixed the breadcrumbs with the butter before sprinkling on the breasts.

Way too much chicken soup sauce for my taste. Very ordinary. I added garlic powder as some others suggested. Without that there would be very little flavor. The chicken was tender, which is the only plus. I certainly can't understands the four and five star reviews unless people enjoy bland.

My whole family decided this one was a "keeper"...simple to make with ingredients that I typically have on hand, and really tasty. I sprinkled chicken with garlic powder as well as pepper, served with couscous and broccoli.

Instead of Cream of Chicken, I used Campbell's Creamy Poblano & Queso and Mexican Cheese Blend in place of Swiss. My whole family loved it and with all the different cream soups available, the possibilities are endless.

Followed the recipe and found it good but bland.  Second time added a package of onion soup mix (also added a little more milk to compensate for dry mix).  It really made the dish pop in the flavor department.  Downside is the rue went from cream colored to brown (the onion soup mix did that).

Made this a couple weeks back. Making it again. I used provolone instead of Swiss because neither I nor my husband like Swiss. Also added garlic to the soup mix and parmesan to the bread crumbs. This time I drizzled garlic olive oil instead of melted butted for the added garlic flavor. Served with baked potatoes and mixed veggies.

This was really good.  Hubby made it for us, but he used cream of mushroom soup and mushrooms instead for the gravy.  Don't know why except he likes mushrooms.  It was really good and really easy for him to make.  I will definitely try with Chicken Soup next time.

So very good! Delicious, moist chicken with a crunchy topping!  I pounded 3 chicken breasts and cut in half to make more uniform, seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. Used provolone cheese on half of them and sharp cheddar on the other 3. Used 1 can cream of chicken soup with 1/4 cup sherry.  Topped with 1-1/2 cups Panko breadcrumbs mixed with 4 Tbs. melted butter and mixed in a bit of garlic salt and paprika. Baked as directed in a 9 x 9 pan.  Used Low broil for last few minutes.  Let sit for 10 minutes and actually served over strained Ramen noodles -- was in a pinch but was perfection!

I read the reviews, and used more cheeses and used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom soups.  I broiled it for 7 minutes at the end to crust the top, nicely.  One of my favorite recipes for ease and deliciousness.  Served over rice.  Great base recipe, and so many ways to customize.  A saver for your recipe box.

I have made a variation of this recipe for many years and it is a family favorite!  My recipe calls for 1/2 cup dry white wine mixed with the soup and uses Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing mix mixed with butter for the topping. It's a winner!

I used spices and fresh herbs to season some mayonnaise instead of using the cream of chicken soup. I used Panko bread crumbs for extra crunch. I did not use any cheese. This is a basic recipe that you can change by using different spices and herbs in the mayonnaise. It is delicious and fun!

This recipe is my husband's favorite. I follow recipe as written, but add poultry seasoning to soup.  Instead of the oven, I layer in my crockpot, cook on high 1 hour, then on low 4-6 hours depending on number of chicken breasts. The chicken will be moist and fall-apart delicious. Cook21

This is similar to a recipe I make except instead of the milk, I use white wine. I've made this for years and have varied they cheese and type of bread crumbs and it always comes out delicious!  My family's favorite way to eat chicken. Usually serve with rice to put the gravy on.  Yum!

It was good.  Instead of regular breadcrumbs, I bought stuffing mix and crushed it to have more of the herbed flavoring.  The one can of soup worked for 3 huge breasts I first pounded then cut into 7 pieces.  I'm looking for more flavor, so next time, I'll try cream of mushroom soup and/or a smoked cheese, like smoked Gouda or Mozzarella.  And maybe season with Italian herbs.

This was the best chicken recipe ever.  My husband loved it.  He said it was the so good at least five times.  This is a winner.  I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Swiss.  I also used seasoned bread stuffing in place of bread crumbs. And I used two cans of cream of chicken soup.

This recipe was easy to prepare and very tasty.  Based on other reviews, I made a few modifications.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with a little bit of garlic powder, in addition to the pepper.  I doubled the amount of soup (1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom) and added about 1/4 cup of cooking Sherry.  I mixed in bread crumbs with the melted butter, before sprinkling the mixture over the chicken.  I ended up cooking the chicken for about 15 extra minutes because the chicken breasts were very thick.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and I'll definitely make it again.  Next time, I'll try using a box of Stovetop stuffing, as others have suggested, since that sounds like a great addition.

This was my  first time making anything from a recipe on allrecipes.com and it was fantastic!! My fiancé absolutely loved it. I added a few different things that I had in the kitchen. I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half crushed townhouse crackers. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I added additional milk and some chicken stock to the canned soup to thin it out a little more and make more sauce. It was really easy and really phenomenal. I will definitely be making this one again!

This was so delicious and moist there was nothing left so no lucnh for hubby the next day he was sad :(  I added 3tbl of sour cream for a little zing, cream of chicken soup because that was what I had on hand and use 2 slices Jack instead of Swiss since we are not fans of Swiss cheese.  I used 6 breast and doubled the recipe and had plenty of gravy to serve over rice, next time I will try noodles next time

Delicious! Subbed white wine for the milk (chardonnay) and used packaged stuffing mix for bread crumbs, everyone loved it!

Anything my boyfriend actually likes automatically gets five stars! I threw in a few drumsticks because a couple people in the house prefer dark meat. Had to cook it longer that way, and the breasts got a little dry. So next time I'll have to put the dark and white meat in different pans. Great flavor, though. I mixed the melted butter with the (Italian seasoned) bread crumbs, got a nice overall golden color on the topping.

This was really good! I used muenster cheese instead of swiss and shredded some fresh parmesan on top of breadcrumbs after uncovering for last 20 min. Also put minced garlic on chicken. HIGHLY recommend.

I have a similar recipe called stuffing good chicken.  I add two cans of cream of chicken or cream of mushroom, peppridge farm stuffing, and 1/2 cup of white wine.  Another option is to add a few slices of prosciutto or ham.  Lighter version - prepare stuffing  and then top that way you can omit the  the butter

This recipe is very good but I've made a similar recipe for years while my kids were growing up. They loved it! They didn't like the bread crumbs so I altered it.  Cook chicken breasts in chicken broth until just done, remove and cut in small pieces, cook cut up fresh broccoli in the chicken broth with small amount of onion. This gives the broccoli very good flavor. Remove from liquid. Then layer chicken, mushroom soup, broccoli, and cheddar cheese, ending with cheese.  Heat in oven until cheese is melted.  So easy and great way to get kids to eat their broccoli.

When my first child was born nineteen years ago, I was given this meal by a friend.  We have been eating this ever since! It's one of my "easy meals" to throw together.  I have never had it with bread crumbs, we have always used a package of croutons.  This can also be prepared ahead of time and frozen or reheated.  However, it is best fresh out of the oven!

This has also been a long time favorite in our household with one exception.  We use Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mixed with melted butter as the topping instead of the bread crumbs.

I've cooked this dish twice.  The first time I used grated Parmesan Cheese instead of Swiss.  I find it allows the soup mixture to fully coat the chicken breast as it's baking.  My wife loves it!

I've made this for years based on a dish my Step Mother makes, in fact we call it Marya's Chicken, it's become a family favorite.  I suggest topping this recipe with crushed Stove Top Stuffing chicken or turkey flavor.  It makes the dish.

I love this recipe! I tried it two weeks ago, as written, but again tonight with a couple of changes. I added gouda cheese as it was all I had, used cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of ragu fetuccini sauce,and half a can of fat free milk used stove top, didn't have bread crumbs or crackers and I topped one flat with fried onions, sprinkle with parmesan for last 5 minutes....wow. you can really go nuts and make all kinds of yummy things with it!!! served with green bean cassarole and fetuccini noodles....:)

My first time making this dish, I served it to guest, something I just don't do. They loved it and so did I. Now, I've made it two more times and it's just as delicious as it was the first. I did add a little of my own seasoning directly to the chicken along with onion, bell pepper and celery in the mixture for extra flavor.

I was stuck in an "I only have an hour to get something on the table" rush.  I remembered seeing this recipe, so I crossed my fingers and gave it a shot.  I only had frozen chicken breasts and no time to thaw them, so I increased the cooking temperature.  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I baked it at 400 degrees; chicken was at 165 degrees when finished and was very juicy and flavorful.  Kids and adults enjoyed it.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe. Didn't change a thing only because I only had 3 chicken breasts.  Only used 3/4 cup of dried bread crumbs(used Panko)which was just right.  I will definitely make this again and will try different cheeses.  Thanks for a great recipe.

No but I'm going to tonight. I have one suggestion that might make this recipe even better... make your own cream of chicken soup. I do and the difference is like night and day. :)  Kind regards and thank you for this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for over 40 years and call it by a different name which I won't divulge.The main ingredient that adds the most flavor is a dry white wine, 1/2 cup which you mix with the soup prior to pouring over the chicken and cheese before adding seasoned stuffing mix ( chicken ) over the top.

Good stuff! When I make this I cube the chicken into about 1 inch pieces rather than using whole chicken breasts. It distributes everything a little better. And of course I HAVE to sprinkle a little garlic powder on the chicken with the pepper. (We love garlic). And use stuffing mix on top.

Easy and good, but needs more seasoning.  Some seasoned salt and poultry seasoning would have really helped

Outstandingly recipe!  My husband usually does not like chicken breasts because they tend to be dry.  This chicken was moist, tender, delicious, and very easy to prepare.

Wanted to try this, but did not have all ingredients. Used Golden Mushroom Soup, white sharp cheddar cheese and crushed tortillas. Whole family loved it! Cannot wait to try it according to recipe. Chicken is juicy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good!! I have a very picky eater boyfriend who also tries to stay healthy so he is big on baked chicken. I wasn't sure if he would like it because of the swiss cheese but he lived it. I did everything the same but I put black pepper and Italian seasonings on the top and bottom of the chicken and I mixed the butter with the bread crumbs. It was so good!

This is the best recipe I've ever tasted! The only change I made is I changed the swiss to cheddar cheese because it was what I had on hand and it was amazing! I would serve this to company.

I've been making this for years! I rated it 4 because I change a couple of things. I substitue havarti for swiss (personal taste) and instead of bread crumbs on top I use stove top stuffing. It is delicious and get praises from every person that has tried it from kiddos to my grandparents!

"Savory" is definitely the right word! I made this for the second time tonight, doubling all but the chicken -I love everything saucy! I added about 1/2 c. dried onion (out of fresh onions) and about 3 cloves of minced garlic. RIDICULOUSLY YUMMY! Will keep this on file for a quick, easy, low hands-on meal!

I have been making Swiss Chicken for my husband for years.  An easy alternative way is this:
In a baking dish:
1 can of Cream of Chicken, spread evenly.
Chicken (4 boneless breasts)
Layer with swiss slices
1 can of Cream of Chicken, spread evenly
Top evenly with bread crumbs.
350 for 45 minutes.
Serve with Mashed potatoes.  The sauce becomes and excellent gravy!  

My husband absolutely LOVES this quick and easy recipe!  If there are leftovers, we always fight over who gets it!!!

I followed the advice of others and seasoned the chicken with some garlic powder & seasoned salt. I didn't have any swiss cheese so I used shredded cheddar & montery jack. I loved it & thought it was delicious! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! I will definately make this again!

Excellent with the addition of sherry mentioned by another reviewer. Definitely mix the melted butter and bread crumbs together (I used Italian style breadcrumbs) in a bowl first.  Then to the breadcrumb mix, I added coarse chopped french's fried onions.  This change eliminates the need to use stuffing mix which would be a little over the top for my palette, no pun intended.  I also seasoned my breasts before putting the toppings on and used provolone as it was all I had on hand.  I liked it well enough with the sherry and cream of chicken soup but next time I will add the cream of mushroom to taste the difference.

Very good, awesome!  Made this using some of the changes that others did and it taste really good!  My girlfriend loves it, and she is way pickier than I am, so this is definitely a winner in my book.  Used 2 cans of soup, added a little extra milk and used Pepper Jack cheese.

This was simple and awesome! Had a few changes since I didn't have the same ingredients: used alfredo cheese sauce instead of the soup, used sharp cheddar cheese slices instead of the swiss, used Stove Top bread crumbs, used olive oil instead of the butter. My family LOVED this dish!!!

I tweaked the recipe a little to make it amazing,
I breaded the chicken before adding to pan. It 
gives the chicken better texture. then layered cheese and bagged dry stuffing. I also used cream of mushroom. Its what I had on hand mixed water and soup together before pouring over top then baked. Not one bite was left Husband and Kids loved it.

I wasn't sure if I would like this. I am not a huge fan of cream of chicken soup. It was delicious. I am glad that I was wrong. I am a huge fan of spices and flavor, which my husband and children are not a fan of. They all loved this and requested that I make it again. I did add extra cheese, which was very, very good. I also added some poultry seasonings and a little more pepper. Very, very good.

WOW WOW WOW....this was an amazing meal.  Very easy and very very good.  I did add curry powder to the chicken soup -- other than that I did what the recipe called for.  Really one of the best meals I have made and enjoyed!  I paired it asparagus and mashed potatoes. Bravo.

This was seriously delicious.  I used stovetop stuffing for the topping as suggested by other reviewers.  It reminded me of a turkey dinner.  I've never used stovetop before and it was tasty!  The chicken stayed pretty moist.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers.

Comfort food! I added a 1/4 cup of white wine to mine. Oh so good! Added s&p and garlic pdr to chicken before laying the cheese on. Used ritz crackers and added the butter to the crackers before sprinkling on top. I also made it a one dish meal by adding in quarted red potatoes. Really good!

I too changed up this recipe. I used 2 cans of Cream of Broccoli Soup mixed with milk. I melted the butter and added bread crumbs to melted butter per previous suggestions. I used shredded mozzarella cheese and I took it a step further and prepared 1 cup of Bisquick mixed with 1 egg & half a cup of milk.  The chicken came out juicy! Kids loved it and asked for seconds!! Definitely a keeper! Thx for sharing..

This was soooo good! One word of caution, though. Do not add extra bread crumbs! I made this mistake (since we liked that part the most) the second time I prepared this recipe and it was awful!

Excellent dish!  The husband even had a second helping.  Like many others I also made some changes.  Instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup I used 2 cans of Golden Mushroom Soup.  I substituted the bread crumbs with Pepperidge Farm Corn Bread Stuffing and mixed it in the melted butter before sprinkling over the sauce.  Instead of pepper I used Mrs. Dash Garlic Herb seasoning.  Instead of milk, I used evaporated milk.  What a wonderful, versitile dish.  Can't wait to have it again and try some new combinations.

This was absolutely awesome!  My husband ended up eating 2 whole chicken breasts--he just couldn't get enough.  I prepared it exactly as directed.  The only change I made was that it took about 15 minutes longer to cook after I uncovered it than described, but my chicken breasts were particularly big so that may have been why.

Great flavor, but poor rating because the directions lack specifics. I followed as the directions as stated, but the cheese and breading melted off the chicken breast before it was done cooking. Need to wait to add until the end of the cooking time. I also used Cream of Chicked w/Herbs and used Provolone instead of Swiss.

This was a great dish. I made it exactly as written, and it lasted me for two fairly big dinner portions. I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but I'll skip all 387 of them this time. It's already very well-reviewed, but I'll throw in my two cents. The taste was great, but if I might quibble a little, I think the amounts of the sauce and the bread crumbs were too much - if I make this again, I'd cut those amounts by 1/3 or even 1/2. And after the fact, it occurs to me that the recipe is light on spices; I'm not good at deciding what to add, but perhaps adding a little bit of one or more herbs or spices would make the taste even better. Lastly, I should mention that the leftovers, reheated 24 hours later, turned out just fine. Thanks for an easy, tasty dish!

Awesome. I did change it up a little. I used two cans of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of milk. To the soup I added: pepper (1/8 tsp), lemon juice (1Tbs), seasoning salt (1/2 tsp), garlic and onion powder (1/2 tsp each), oregano and parsely (1/4 tsp each). For my husband's and mine I used pepper jack cheese and for the kids I used provolone. I also sprinkled 1/4 cup cheddar cheese over the top before adding fresh, homemade breadcrumbs. Thanks for a great and easy recipe. Next time I will try the Stove top on top idea.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's simple, doesn't take much time and comes out fabulous.  I've used American cheese in a pinch and it comes out just as well.  Following the recipe exactly yields a great result!  Thanks for submitting this!

Very good recipe, and easy too!  I used this as one of the meats for my daughter's wedding reception.....I even used pre-cooked chicken breasts to make it easier.  I had many people at our church asking me for the recipe!  Thank goodness for the print button!

Yes, this was easy.  If it had ended up on my "best lazy meals" list it probably would get a 5 but not sure I'd ever make it again.  I couldn't taste the cheese at all, so seemed like a waste of fat.  (I also rarely have Swiss around.)  The crumb topping didn't look like too much, but I think it helped give this a sense of being drier than it is.  There's plenty of goop to spoon back over the chicken, and when it looked like plenty I thought it would go good on mashed potatoes, so I whipped up some instant real quick.  (That part did work out well, since instant taters are a little dull, shall we say?)  Not worth buying Swiss for, but I might make again if I happen to have some around needing used up.  (Which is probably how I happened upon this to start with.)

This was great! The chicken came out extremely juicy. It was a big hit in my house! I was asked to make it constantly! The only problem was I needed to use more than one can of soup, so I used 2 and it seemed like to much. The meal was very soupy. I did season the chicken with pepper and chicken seasoning. I covered the chicken with swiss, so about a piece and a half on each breast. But it was very good.

The only ingredient that gave this recipe any flavor was the cheese.  I did not like this recipe.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because my husband thought it was convenient.

Delicious!  I also changed the recipe a bit.  Instead of using whole chicken breasts I cut 2 breasts into 2 to 3 inch pieces.  I also used chicken flavored stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and then sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of that.  I served it over rice and it was great! Very juicy chicken.

I only rate recipes using the exact ingredients...this was was pretty good.  Did the recipe exactly according to the directions.   Chicken was moist and flavorful, but the 1 cup of dry breadcrumbs seemed a little overkill on 4 chicken breast halves.  Plus during the baking, all the bread crumbs slid off in the juices and kind of caked on the bottom of the pan.  Glad I sprayed it!  I did read some of the reviews after (wondering what I did wrong) and a lot of raters modified the recipe.  Maybe using stuffing would work out better than the breadcrumbs.  Thanks anyway!

This is delicious and I cook it all the time in our home. However I made some modifications too. I use mozzarella. I add 1/2 cup milk instead of 1/4. A little minced garlic and grated parmesan to the soup mixture. Also I use soft bread crumbs (toasted bread w/ butter) My picky husband loves it and my 2 year old adores chicken.

Wowsers! Just made this for me and my sweetie..so delicious! The only substitution I made was cream of celery instead of cream of chicken. I cooked it exactly as stated, 55 minutes total. It turned out SUPER moist and flavourful. I cannot wait to try this recipe with different  spices and stuffing as a topping instead of the breadcrumbs as mentioned in previous reviews..MMMM can't wait to make it/eat it again..

This was pretty good. I followed others advice. I mixed stuffing mix and breadcrumbs in some melted butter over the cheese, and I used mozzerella cheese.  The stuffing is what made it tasty. The chicken was still kind of bland so next time I may use some more seasoning on the breast prior to baking

I really liked this (with some alterations).  I did season the chicken with a garlic/onion seasoning and salt and pepper and drizzled olive oil on them.  I also seasoned the canned soup/milk with pepper, thyme and rosemary.  I used colby/jack since that's all I had and sprinkle the breadcrumbs with parmesan cheese.  It was really good.  I think this could be changed up a number of ways with different seasonings, herbs, canned soups and cheeses.  By the way, I love the breadcrumbs on top!

The only changes I made were to add a thin slice of ham over each breast, as was previously suggested, and coated with EVOO, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  The chicken breasts were tender and juicy.  The sauce was pretty good but for me tasted too much like the soup.  It needs a little punching up.

OH EM GEE!!!!! This was soooooo delicious!  I didnt tweak the recipe much but what I did, in my mind, made it yummy. Coated chicken in olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice. The swiss was perfect!! Used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup.  Added grated parmesean cheese under the layer of bread crumbs.  IMPORTANT!!!!  Make sure to melt butter in a bowl and gradually add bread crumbs to soak it up before applying the crumb layer. The picture does NOT give the flavor justice!!  YUM YUM YUM!

I just made this the other night and to my surprised was very tasty. I loved the creamy sauce. My only suggestion is to marinate the chicken overnight so the spices and seasons will soak in. Also the chicken breasts were big and thick, so it might be best to cut them into smaller pieces or half them.

very good!  I changed the recipe a little...I used Mozz cheese instead of swiss and used a whole box of stove top stuffing.  I also added 1 more tblsp of butter and 1/4 of water to compensate for the extra stuffing.  Even my picky 4 year old loved it.  I will def. make again!

delicious! i added a generous amount of garlic powder and fresh cracked pepper to the chicken before adding the cheese. i also substituted swiss for mozzarella since i don't care for swiss. i also added more mozz and parmesan 5 minutes before the end bake time, as someone else had mentioned.

This was very good. Did make some changes though. Insted of milk i used sour cream and ritz crackers insted of bread crumbs. Had a little trouble with everything sliding off of the chicken but it was very tasty!

My boyfriend and son LOVED this recipe, I was told I could make it weekly. I made it just as directed, except added an additional 1/2 can of soup. With the size of the chicken breasts, it probably wasn't needed. Next time I will take a readers suggestion and serve over noodles- great use of the extra sauce! I love this recipe because of how simple it is!

My husband raves and raves and raves about this recipe! After trying it  "as is" the first time, I added tweaks to cater to our family : stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs, extra spices on the chicken, etc. It's a no fail, that's so simple to make on a night after work!

This was great and easy! I seasoned the chicken breasts before adding the cheese. I added sherry to the soup mixture. Next time I will omit the butter and use less bread crumbs. Will also try with low-fat soup and a sharper cheese.

I changed the recipe somewhat and the whole family really liked the end result.  I used 6 slices of Swiss, added some bacon bits, a splash of white wine,  and mushrooms, doubled the milk and used both cr. of chicken and cr. of mushroom soups.  I liberally sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder, pepper and a French herb blend of seasonings.  Next time, I may leave out the bacon bits or use real chopped bacon I have fried.  I melted the butter and mixed it with Panko bread crumbs.  I liked the topping.

Loved it! I think the ingredients need to be doubled for 4 breasts if you plan to use the sauce with noodles or something. I used 2 with what the recipe called for and it was just enough.
Also, used cheddar and stove top stuffing. It was great!

Awesome recipe....my husband & son loves it and have requested that I add this to my "regularly used" recipes. The only changes I made were...I sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic powder and seasoning salt along with the pepper. I used shredded mozza cheese (that was what I had on hand) and used a combined mixture of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups. I also used half & half of regular bread crumbs and Italian style bread crumbs. Rave reviews all around! Thanks for a great recipe!

I also changed this recipe.  I used reduced fat cream of chicken soup, fat free milk, and weight watchers shredded cheese on the chicken.  It is a keeper.

mmm...These were so good. I used cream of chicken and mushroon soup and used sour cream instead of the milk and they turned out so good. Sprinkled the top lightly with italian style bread crumbs and sprayed with olive oil pam and they had a slight crunck which was perfect.  Next I'll experiment with different soup mixtures and cheeses. But this is great for weeknights when I don't get home until almost 6 o'clock! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful. My husband, who is a very picky eater, loved this dish. I made a few changes. I used wheat bread crumbs and seasoned the chicken breast with garlic powder, minced onions, seasoned salt, and parsley along with black pepper. We don't like swiss cheese, so I used shredded cheddar cheese instead. I did mix the bread crumbs with the butter before putting ontop of the chicken like a previous review said. I will absoutly make this recipe again, Thanks :-)

I made this dish tonight, making some slight alterations.  As others suggested, I seasoned the chicken breasts with pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder before placing the swiss cheese slices on the chicken.  I also increased the milk to 1/2 a cup and had no problem covering my 4 chicken breasts.  Lastly, I mixed 3 tablespoons melted butter and 1 1/2 cups of Stove Top chicken flavored stuffing and covered the chicken with the mixture.  I baked the chicken as directed in the recipe.  It came out tender and juicy.  And surprisingly, I got a rare thumbs up from a picky boyfriend!  I enjoyed the dish as well.  The only change I think I will make next time is to cut the breasts into halves.  Will be making this again!

It was a great recipe to build on! Of course, I too, added/changed some things. I spiced the chicken with garlic powder, season salt, pepper, and onion powder.  I used sour cream instead of milk. I added a little salsa to the soup mixture (for added flavor/color--it was a nice contrast against the green beans I served with it).  I also added sliced green olives and a little cayenne pepper to the soup mix. I crushed some Cheez Its and fried onions in lieu of bread crumbs. I was fantastic! I will definitely make it again!

Good start but this recipe needs the tweaking suggested by all the reviewers.  Definitely season the heck out of the chicken first.  I used cream of mushroom soup.  I also recommend a seasoned breadcrumb mixed with grated Parmesan and melted butter.  Tasty but not low calorie.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  Not at all bland like one of the reviewers said it might be.  Perfect the way it is, no need to change a thing!  Hubby also loved it, it's definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

As other users suggested, I added some sour cream to the sauce mixture, used stuffing with melted butter in lieu of the breadcrumbs, and added canned drained mushrooms. Excellent,moist and juicy and a crowd pleaser,  What a snap. With alterations I'd give it a 5 star. A keeper.

This recipe was great. I did make a few changes. I added some sliced mushrooms and I seasoned with salt and just a pinch of oregano in addition to the pepper. I also added garlic. Other than that, it was great! I will make this again.

At work we call this "the recipe" which means we cook this for every special occasion luncheon for a crowd.  We use Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Dressing (not the cubed version) instead of bread crumbs for the topping.  Adds a more savory flavor and more eye appeal.

This was a simple dish to prepare and turned out very tasty. Good comfort food and uses things usually on hand in the pantry, so no special trips to the store. I added a little extra melted margarine since it seemed so dry before I baked it and glad I did or I can't imagine what it would have been like before. This would benefit from a pinch of poultry seasoning, but this was decent on it's on as written. Thanks, Lori, we enjoyed a nice chicken dinner tonight.

wonderful - even my picky teenager liked it!  I substituted whole wheat Ritz Crackers for the breadcrumbs and it was delicious!  A keeper for sure!  Love that it has ingredients that are normally always on hand and is quick!

Although I made some minor changes out of necessity, these are delicious!
I had to substitute Cream of Mushroom since that's all I had, but it went great with the Swiss cheese! I took a couple of others advice and seasoned with pepper, Seasoned salt, garlic powder and Poultry seasonings before adding the cheese and soup mixture. When it was time to bake uncovered, I sprinkled generously with Parmesian cheese. It was absolutely delicious! Since I only used three chicken breasts, I cut reduced the bread crumbs by half but it made an almost stuffing consistency, which just added to the already great taste. I lightly sprinkled with fresh lemon right before serving.
Thanks so much for sharing this great (and easy) recipe!

I hate chicken breasts unless its grilled.
And the winter months prohibit me from the grill =(.  So I am always looking for great chicken breasts recipes.  This was one was pretty good.  The only thing is I did season the chicken breast a little more and decided to take the advice of melting the butter and mixing it with the bread crumbs and then topping the chicken with it.  All in all the chicken was EXTREMELEY MOIST and very tasty, great recipe to experiment with.

Really easy and quick to make. Very good, the only thing that I think could be improved is maybe a few more spices, and maybe some more cheese. One of my favorites to make.

This was delicious!  I seasoned with seasoned salt, pepper, onion powder, and just a touch of garlic powder.  Also, since I was making twice as many breasts (I have a husband AND a 14-yr old boy!), I used two cans of soup, one cream of chicken, and one cream of mushroom.  Excellent!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was very low effort and turned out great.  I did modify it by using sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss, using 1/2 c. milk, and mixing in some crushed up goldfish crackers with the bread crumbs to make it extra cheesy.  There were no leftovers and even my very picky son loved it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and cornbread.

I used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs (what I had!) and used a shredded cheese mix (also what I had on hand). Those were the only changes I made and it turned out pretty good. My kids and hubby liked it better than me, but I would definitely make again.

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have swiss cheese though, so I used motzerella and mild cheddar.  I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup for added creaminess.  It was very good over mashed potatoes.  I cut the chicken breasts in half and fork poked them, so they were very tender.  I will make this again.

I was disappointed in this.  The cream of chicken soup just made it salty and uninteresting.  I don't recommend this recipe at all.

i made this recipe tonight because i had most of the ingredients, only substituted condensed cheese and broccoli soup because i didn't have the cream of chicken.  i took the advice of other reviewers and used two slices of swiss for each chicken breast and also used ritz crackers and cheese and garlic croutons, smashed up, for the topping.  we all loved it and my husband said to make it the exact same way everytime.  thanks for the super easy and delicious recipe!

this recipe is a favorite but gets 4 stars because I modified it a bit. Instead of swiss I used muenster cheese and also added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, a few dashes of worchestershire and replaced the milk with sour cream to make a thicker sauce. I also made the topping using crushed ritz crakers mixed with a parmesean cheese and melted butter and sprinkled it on AFTER I took the foil off. I cooked some medium egg noodles and served the chicken and sauce over them. AMAZING flavor! A world of difference. Our favorite chicken recipe!

This was very moist & good tasting, although there should be some modification to the bake time, I ended up cutting up RAW chicken pieces so I had to nuke it for a while before I could serve it to our family.  I even cut my chicken breasts butterfly style, so they weren't even thick... I also used a Pyrex dish, but I did compensate by adding a bit more time, just not enough.  Will make again but with more time added, like 20+ minutes.  (Probably in the crock pot for certainty on done-ness.)

I got a better response from my family the second time around.  This time I double the swiss cheese as others had advised, and I used a cup of crushed Townhouse crackers, and a half cup of seasoned bread crumbs.

I thought this was great.  Like others suggested, I sprinkled a little garlic salt on the chicken along with the pepper.  I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and used shredded swiss cheese.  Next time I may cut back on the bread crumbs a little, but otherwise I loved this.

very good.  We tried ours with stuffing and it came out great.  The bake time however was way too long.  I baked it covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for about 15 and it was still slightly dry.  I normally only cook chicken breasts for about 20 minutes total.  Still a great recipe and we wil make it again but maybe with cream of mushroom soup or a tastier cream of chicken.

The flavor was really good, but it did seem as though it was missing something. Maybe I will try it again using less bread crumbs and serving it over mashed potatoes.

I made this last night for my nephew whose mother is a fabulous cook.  He loved this.  The only substitution I made was cream of celery soup since I did not have cream of chicken.  I made NO other substitutions.  
I would make this again and again.  Is a quick and tasty way to serve chicken breasts.

I seasoned the chicken with Herb & Garlic Seasoning & pepper, used Provolone cheese slices, and Peppridge Farm Stuffing Mix, in place of crumbs, for topping. Used Chicken/Mushroom soup. It was a little bland, but it's a good, easy main dish.

This is a must keep chicken dish!  My fiance' who hates eating chicken loved this dish and even my extremely picky 5 year old finished his plate way faster than usual.

This recipe is okay. I sprinkled poultry seasoning directly on chicken before covering with soup and bread crumbs. I wish I had used stuffing instead like some others suggested.

Just tried this for dinner tonight and LOVED it! The chicken is so moist and flavorful. I had to use velveeta cheese, but it was so good with that. I may use stuffing like others suggested, next time. But this is a keeper for sure!!!

Delicious! I usually use Pepperidge Farm stuffing instead of breadcrumbs. I have interchanged the cream of chicken soup with celery and/or mushroom soup. I have also successfully done this in a slow cooker. Very tasty, thanks :-)

Although the chicken turned out very juicy we did not care for the chicken soup.  I think next time I will try mushroom soup, which seems to taste far less salty.

Ok, I have made this two ways, one is following the recipe and the other is substituting cream of celery and using italian bread crumbs. Our personal favorite was the substitutions. Its too bland using cream of chicken. This one is really easy to make and my four year old likes it.

This was delicious. I altered it in a few ways because I didn't want to go to the store and so used what was on hand. Instead of swiss cheese I used American and instead of cream of chicken soup I used cream of mushroom. I didn't have dry bread crumbs so I blended up a slice of bread and put those crumbs on there. So it didn't have the crunchier taste BUT with all the changes my husband still fell in LOVE with this dish. All I head were Mmmmm from his side of the table. The chicken is very tender and the mixture is just delicious. This is definately going in my favorites list.

We will be keeping this recipe. I followed the suggestion of two slices of swiss on each chicken breast (which I flattened beforehand) and used the cream of chicken with herbs soup, since that was what was available at the grocery store. Delicious with rice.

My husband loved this and said to make this again.  I used Italian Style bread crumbs for more flavor.  Also mixed the bread crumbs with butter as suggested from other reviewers.

My boyfriend and I thought the chicken was moist and tasty.  I made it with a wild rice casserole (chicken stock, mushrooms, water chestnuts, onions, garlic) and these two paired perfectly!!  The only thing I would do differently next time is season the chicken more and cut down on the bread crumbs as well as mix them with the melted butter before adding it to the dish.   Nummy!

This was very good.  The next time I make it I will add two slices of swiss instead of one (per requuest of my kids), and as someone else suggested, I will mix the melted butter with the bread crumbs before putting it on the chicken.  My family really liked this meal and the chicken was very juicy.

Wow! This is an unbelieveable recipe! Everything about it is perfect! My husband would like for  me to cook "that good chicken" every night, I swear. I'm actually making it tonight! I like to serve it over rice... it's an incredibly hearty and moist dish. I can't say enough about it. Thanks, Lori!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I followed the basic recipe and added a few extra spices with cream of chicken and mushrooms soup. The chicken was very tender and moist.  Everyone gave it 2 thumbs up.  I will definitely make it a regular part of our rotation.

It’s so crazy to me that people change and add 9 different items to a recipe and then give it 5 stars. They’re rating their own recipe and not the one written. How does this help anyone trying the recipe ? If you want to do that submit your own recipe and rate that one ! Valerie changed the cheese, increased the milk, added sherry, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, stuffing mix and Parmesan! Then gave it a 5. How is this even possible !!!

The whole can of soup was a little too much. If I make it again I’ll probably use half a can. Less panko bread crumbs too. I’d use the Italian ones, gives it more flavor. I also used the Mexican cheese we had at the house and went crazy with it, but we love cheese. I did a broccoli and rice packet for a side. A touch over salty tasting but that could be the bread crumbs I used.

This is a simple recipe that satisfied my craving for a good curry. I added some red peppers for spice and 2.5 table spoons of curry and 1/4 tsp of turmeric to give more of an Indian curry taste. 

Thanks this will definitely be my go to for curry recipe.

It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious! My family enjoyed it! The only change I did was sprinkle some onion and garlic seasoning over breadcrumbs.

I made the recipe but only have family of three so only 3 chicken breasts. I think it would of been better with the extra one to much left over soup. It was good.

My family enjoyed this very much. After adding the bread crumbs and then the melted butter, I found that the ratio between the two isn't equal. I have a lot of dry breadcrumbs. Next time will add more butter or use maybe half of the breadcrumbs.

Quick and easy recipe, I used both cream of chicken and mushroom. I’m not used to using canned soups so this was kinda like an old school recipe mom would have made back in the day. It was flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender

I’ve been baking this dish for years. I first started with just the dry bread crumbs. But the original recipe is a bit bland with just pepper. I use pepper,salt and garlic and rub it all over the chicken. I use shredded Swiss cheese or sharp cheddar. I use the soup and milk and pour that over. Sometimes I use cream of mushroom. But on top I’ve been using Stove Top Dressing for chicken. I drizzle more than 3 tablespoons melted butter. Maybe twice that. I bake it the same way. It’s so much more flavorful that dry bread crumbs. Yo can also use Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix as well. Excellent base recipe so I give it 5 stars! I don’t think it’s fair when people change the recipe and then give it less than 5 stars.

Was ok. Think it needed more than the bread crumbs listed in the recipe. The cheese was almost un-noticeable.

I made this last night for dinner and it we enjoyed it. Others have said they used 2 cans of soup but I found 1 can sufficient, however I did use the low fat option of soup and added about a 1/3 of a cup of milk. I also  substituted the only cheese I had which was Gouda, but I think it would have tasted fine without the cheese.   I mixed the butter with the breadcrumbs before sprinkling over the  top. They  were yummy  and added a bit of texture to the dish.   I made my meal in a metal pan and place the pan under a broiler for a minute or so to brown up the bread crumbs a bit. All and all a nice simple meal without spending a lot of preparation time.

We added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Topped with a little extra Swiss (who doesn’t love more cheese?).  My son is one of the most pickiest eaters, and also doesn’t really care for chicken. He CLEANED his plate before WE were even done.  Delicious!

I made this and it was delicious! I  didn't have Swiss cheese so I used shredded cheddar cheese and it turned out great. I definitely will make it again.  I will experiment  like other people did.

I was so excited to try my first recipe. I did this with a few adjustments and only because I did not have all of the ingredients listed at the time.  I substituted the condensed cream chicken soup with Continental’s Creamy Chicken Soup in a cup.  I added a tablespoon of cornflour to the mixture to thicken the sauce a bit.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of plain breadcrumbs.   Unfortunately I had to bake it without the foil because I had none left ??.  Turns out covering the dish with foil is an important step because the chicken did end up a little bit dry.  I followed everything else and was so thrilled to have a yummy homecooked meal that was so easy to make!  My family loves it. I’ll be making this again for sure.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Amazing.  Admittedly made a few changes: doubled the cream of chicken, used dry white wine instead of milk, sharp white cheddar instead of Swiss, and stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs.  That being said, I would’ve never come up with this on my own.  My husbands request “Can you make this everyday?”

This turned out great and I will definitely be making it again. I didn’t have Swiss on hand so I used sharp cheddar (I think Swiss or Muenster would actually be better). I think I’ll also occasionally make this without the cheese. I used two chicken breasts, the full can of soup and 1/4 C milk but half the bread crumb/butter mixture. This is super easy.

Made no changes. Chicken was moist and had good flavor. I thought there might be more of a gravy-type sauce with it but the breadcrumbs kinda thickened it. Might make again but I would probably use 2 cans of soup next time.

I made reviewer Valerie Brunmeir's modifications with the exception of 1 cup of plain store bought breadcrumbs instead of 1.5 cups of stovetop stuffing mix. It turned out very well and my family enjoyed it. We had leftovers and the now day-old topping was mushy but still good , more like a thick gravy, so that worked out well it seemed like a slightly different dish to my family.

I happened to have cherry wood smoked deli ham on hand for sandwiches, so I added that with the Swiss cheese on top of the chicken.    I was really surprised at how good this was.  Will definitely be making it again!

I made it just as the recipe stated and it was excellent, very tender and the swiss cheese didn't take over the flavor, it gave a thicker sauce near the breasts.  
This recipe is officially on my favorite chicken list.

I substituted the cream of chicken for golden cream of mushroom. We weren't able to really taste the cheese until I had leftovers the next day. Overall it turned out quite well and my husband definitely would like it made again.

I adore this recipe and I make this dish a couple of times a month. My family loves it, too. The only change I made was to combine Stove Top Stuffing (Chicken) with the melted butter and I sprinkled that on top. This gives great texture to the dish. I like to serve this with rice pilaf and a green salad.

I altered the recipe based upon earlier reviews.  Instead of water, I used all beef broth.  Also, I browned the chicken breasts in butter in a skillet first, then sautéed mushrooms with some garlic before putting everything together into the pan and then into the oven.  Basically, the dish turned out well, but, if I were to do this again, I would omit the breadcrumbs, as they didn't seem to add much.  I served the chicken with sautéed spinach, but next time I will use something different because the spinach didn't seem to complement the dish.

Made this following recipe with the exception of using 3 chicken breasts rather than 4. It was delicious and easy to assemble. Would consider adding fresh mushrooms next time. A definite winner!

Simple & delicious.  I made half the recipe (there are only 2 of us) and used American cheese and panko crumbs.  Then went by the recipe as is.  It's a keeper!  Hubby love it.

I followed the recipe very closely. Used gruyere cheese instead of the Swiss, and white wine in place of the milk. Wish I had taken the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, because it was great! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Hubby says I should make it at least once a week!!

This was an excellent dish. I know that I will be making this many more times in the future.  However, I believe that the amount of bread crumbs could be cut down to about 3/4 cup.

Fun recipe and presentation.  I meant to bring the eggs and milk to room temp, but forgot.  Nevertheless, the method and recipe worked fairly well.  I had to bake longer, and even put the broiler on low to finish the middle a bit.  I used cinnamon and vanilla instead of nutmeg (personal preference).  We all enjoyed this, some with applesauce, or almond butter, or berries.

This is a variation of a recipe that my family has been making for years. We use cream of mushroom soup and mix in a 1/2 a cup of white wine. So first the chicken breasts (cut into quarters) and swiss cheese on top and then pour on the soup/wine combo and instead of topping with bread crumbs, mix a melted stick of butter or margarine with the bread crumbs in a chicken stove top stuffing recipe and put on top. Cook at 325 F for one hour and a quarter to one hour and a half. Amazing with cranberry sauce and broccoli or carrots - a mini Thanksgiving dish!

Delicious!  I followed others' suggestions and used stuffing instead of bread crumbs, and Muenster cheese instead of Swiss, but I am sure it would have been great the original way, too.  I was cooking for two, but made the full sauce (didn't want half a can of soup left over); this made it extra saucy, but it was so good, we didn't mind at all!  Will definitely make again.

Made it according to instructions. Probably should have left it in the oven, uncovered for an additional 10-15 mins to really brown the breadcrumbs but was afraid chicken would be overdone - I used chicken tenderloins rather than breasts. Delicious meal. I served it with rice and even mixed the sauce into the rice. Really delicious and easy meal.

I used cream of mushroom soup and a smokey provolone instead of swiss cheese. This is a very versatile recipe. Yummy!

This was excellent!  I happened to have sliced Muenster cheese and Italian breadcrumbs.   I used frozen chicken breasts and changed the temperature to 375 degrees.    Can't wait for lunch tomorrow, so I can try another portion!

Delicious! Moist, tender, fragrant and best of all...so easy. I did read the reviews and made a few excellent alterations. I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I added the butter to the bread crumbs and used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of white wine. Cooked it for  55 minutes and PERFECTO! This will be my go too recipe when I'm at a loss  for what to make. I'll try this with noodles next time.

Thank you Leagle for providing this recipe! While like so many others I did not follow the recipe as noted it did provided a great starting place. 
I replaced the milk with sour cream and added about 2 tablespoons of honey mustard dressing instead. I also mixed the butter with the breadcrumbs first. 
It was a big hit! Will definitely make it again.

Incredibly easy and so delicious and moist. Used garlic and onion powder to add more flavor. Used Ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs. Was a big hit!! Will definitely make this again and again.

Cooked as the recipe indicates and it was great, meat was tender, cut with a fork. 2 seasoned chicken breasts in a glass dish, covered with the mixture of chicken soup and milk and topped with bread crumbs moistened with melted butter. 30 minutes at 350 covered and 20 minutes uncovered, perfect. Know it's good when the wife says I can make it again.  Thanks

Really great base recipe. I long with others made changes. Only slightly. ??Added salt and pepper and garlic power and extra milk. My bread crumbs didn't brown. I put a pad of butter in a frying pan. Then added Italian Panko  bread crumbs to the butter and browned mine that way. Turned out great. Will make again. My 12 year old son loved it. Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe. I used cream of mushroom. Not so fond of cream of chicken.

I was hesitant to try this, but all the excellent reviews got my curiosity aroused. This dish is WONDERFUL. I used one 35 calorie spreadable Swiss cheese wedge on each breast and added an extra grinding of black pepper before baking. Cooking in the sauce covered with foil made the chicken turn out unbelievably tender. There was enough sauce left to enjoy over mashed potatoes. YUM!

Awesome!  Mixed butter & crumbs together then generously topped.  Made it " Cordon Bleu"; thin slice of deli ham under the cheese.  It was wonderful!!

I made this for my extremely picky husband (a meat and more meat guy) who hates breadcrumbs on top of anything.... 
He inhaled it and went back for seconds...!!
- I had 3 really large boneless breasts with rib meat so i cut them down to more like a thigh portion size - it made 6, so i doubled everything else too.
- added some cajun seasoning mix that we use on everything to the chicken, and then again to the soup - not a lot though, just enough (maybe 2-3 tsp total?)
- used sliced gouda instead of swiss (none of us like swiss) - 2 slices per chicken portion
- added Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs - quite a bit too, maybe 2-1 breadcrumbs to parm ratio, and put it on very liberally all over top
- only drawback was the time, since I had thick chicken, i had to put it back in longer, probably closer to 40 mins + 30 mins
- i served this with garlic mashed potatoes (quick bag mix) and steambag green beans - YUMMY! Daughter ended up grabbing some bread to sop up the remaining sauce it was soooo good!!
** thinking next time to add mushrooms or change to 1 can crm chicken, 1 can crm mushroom (remember i had doubled everything because i had a lot of chicken)...but then again picky doesn't like mushrooms either lol**

Chicken breasts in cream of chicken soup combo is one of my family's faves and I've always struggled with getting it just right. This recipe does it. The only thing I added was marinating the chicken in a olive oil, water, cooking sherry with fresh rosemary, oregano, and majoram marinate for 6 hours before cooking. This will be a regular. Thanks.

This was amazing.  Will definately make this for company.  I used 6oz chicken breasts.  Half a slice of cheese on each.  I also used cream of mushroom with half a cup of milk and added a small can of sliced mushrooms.  I make my own seasoned bread crumbs so I'm sure that changed the flavor a little.  My chicken was a little dry so will cut the covered time to 20 minutes next time.  I served this with noodles and green beans.  It was very, very rich and creamy.  A winner!!!

I used frozen chicken tenderloins, thawed, instead of chicken breasts.  I filled the bottom of the 9 X 13.  The family liked it, but the chicken was not very seasoned with just the pepper, so I would lightly season the chicken with some garlic powder and maybe a very light sprinkling of season salt.

Best chicken ever. Will definitely be cooking this again.

as written I would rate this about 3 stars.  I would rate it 5 stars with a few alterations - so giving it in between rating of 4 stars.. I layered thickly sliced mushrooms on bottom of pan - at least 8 oz.. Then chicken.  Added pepper and garlic powder. then cheese.  I make a homemade cream of mushroom soup from allrecipes and add about 1/4 c chardonnay and 1/4 c marsala wines instead of milk.  Put a little more swiss cheese on top.  Cook covered then uncovered.  Last 10 minutes I melt the butter, mix with Italian panko crumbs and pour and bake for remaining time.  I also throw under the broiler for a minute or so.  If you want to add a little parmesan cheese on top at end that is ok too.
The panko is nice and crunchy if you do it this way, the wines add a nice flavor and extra mushrooms - what is not to love.  It does have a high fat content - however we only eat 4 oz and have with 6 oz or more  steamed veggies - no carbs so overall the meal is not so bad for you.  All in moderation.  Thanks Leagle for a great recipe - the chicken comes out really moist and the whole family loves with the few modifications - which you can adjust  for your own families preferences.

Tasted good, even better reheated the next day.  I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of celery soup.  In place of bread crumbs I used a box of chicken seasoned stuffing mix.  Even my picky 9 year old liked it.

This recipe was delicious, easy, fast, and really made a great hit when I served it for my family and company. I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers and added 1/2 cup dry white wine in with the milk and soup. I also substituted a box of chicken flavored Stove Top Stuffing mix in place of the bread crumbs. I will be making this again.

Easy and delicious! Prepared  using gluten free soup and breadcrumbs, so good.  I can't wait to try with other combinations of cheese and soup.   Use 2 cans of soup if you want extra gravy.

I added a 5th chicken breast to the recipe in order to have enough. I still used the same amount of soup and bread crumbs on top. It was still enough liquid for the dish. Everyone liked it very much.

This was fab.  I read the reviews before proceeding and made the following changes:  I used broccoli cheddar soup and blended it with a combination of sour cream, milk, and white wine.  I added a head of steamed broccoli florets to the soup mixture before pouring it over the chicken.  I topped it off with a box of chicken flavored stuffing that had been pre-mixed with two sticks of butter.

I made it, but I used cream of potato soup with 2 chicken bouillon cubes (mashed to a powder), and shredded cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Everything else was the same. Makes for an awsome meal. You must try it!

I made this chicken as a trial run for supper tonight to see if I would want to serve this to company.  This was a fabulous recipe and I definitely wouldn't hesitate to make this for guests.  I used havarti cheese and placed 2 thin slices of deli ham between the chicken and cheese.  I also seasoned the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning and Lawry's seasoning, in addition to black pepper.  I wouldn't season with salt as the soup has a lot of sodium.  I used low fat cream of chicken soup and panko crumbs.  I ended up baking the chicken for 70 minutes in total.  My husband gave it a thumb's up!

We both loved this. Seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning and Lawrys salt, black pepper and garlic powder.  Used a slice of pancetta over chicken before adding cheese (used pepper jack on Dave's serving).  Used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Sprinkled Parmesan over dish 5 min before taking it out of oven. Very moist.  Served over white rice. Gravy was very good, next time double it.

This is the BEST chicken recipe I've ever made or tasted.  I'm 81, married for 61 years and made a lot of chicken.  Not complicated.

Since there are only 2 of us, I used just 2 chicken breast.  They were quite large and paid more for chicken that does NOT use anti biotics.  EXCELLENT!  BTW: I I used Panko crumbs.)

Our whole family LOVES this dish!!!  I have made it a constant dinner in my rotation and it is always a hit!  The only changes I make are adding more chicken and another can of cream of chicken soup. I also season the chicken a little more with some garlic powder, but basically this recipe is perfect as is!!

Not bad, I read some reviews and made some changes. Used 2 lg cans of cr of mush soup and some milk to make extra sauce and served with egg noodles. Also used the stuffing instead of bread crumbs and doubled the cheese. Hard to tell if the chicken was done because it was smothered. Not bad though. Oh, also seasoned the chicken with onion salt, pepper and minced garlic.

I've been making this dish for many years. I got the recipe out of a  Southern Living cookbook, and  it's my go-to when I'm in a hurry. Easy and delicious.  Only difference in the recipes is that mine calls for some garlic powder and white wine or chicken broth to thin the soup. I like to use Marsilla.

Made this tonight. Pretty good. The chicken came out really moist and the topping came out really crisp. Didn't use Swiss cheese but cheddar and even if I had used Swiss, it felt like something was missing, additional herbs or spices in the topping might be needed. Overall, a good recipe to play around with & add different condensed soups, seasonings & cheese.

This is dangerously delicious. I added an extra clove of garlic and had a side of mashed potatoes with it. Yum! I also tried it again using cream of mushroom. It's just as good.

This was super easy to make. I wanted something different with boneless chicken. I did modify it slightly. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I made my own with chopped onion, parsley, butter, flour and chicken stock. It turned out better than canned. I used provolone instead of Swiss and I added crunchy onions to panko breadcrumbs. Very tasty.

This was a huge hit with my family!  Next time I'll need to use more chicken breasts so there's' some leftovers for the next day :) Made a couple changes since I didn't have all ingredients on hand. Used thick slices of Sargento Monterey Jack, 2 cans Cream of Chicken (based on other reviews), increased milk to 1/2 cup, and Italian bread crumbs instead of plain crumbs.  Also, sprinkled both sides of the chicken (prior to cheese placement) with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  Instead of drizzling the melted butter, I mixed it with the bread crumbs and evenly sprinkled over the chicken.  I'm not a huge chicken lover, but it loved this!  Great flavor and chicken was very moist. This will become a regular rotation in our house.

Tasted great but way too much soup mixture. Next time I will omit the milk and only put the thicker and less soup on the chicken. Serve with green vegetable for color.

I read several reviews and decided to make the changes that Valerie's Kitchen suggested and am very happy that I did. The sherry was a nice touch - it gave the dish more dimension (not sure how else to describe it). My husband told me it was a home run. That is HUGE because he is quite picky, and I am still trying to learn to cook (still newlyweds). Thank you for the recipe AND the suggestions!

As always, I used this recipe as a starting point, so my rating is for my variation not the original recipe. I'm not a fan of swiss so I used provolone. I used low-fat cream of chicken, which worked out fine. I added fresh spinach, because vegetables. I also cut the chicken into smaller pieces so it'd be easier to serve and line the dish. I also only used 2 breasts but still 4 slices of cheese, because cheese. I used about 2/3 of the sauce because I thought the spinach might need a bit of help. My only problem was that the spinach released some water as it cooked, so that had to be spooned out, but not the end of the world. I forgot to pepper the chicken, so I salt and peppered the bread crumbs instead. Also threw in a sprinkle of garlic powder, because garlic.

It seems weird to me to use cream of chicken soup on chicken. Next time I'll try cream of broccoli to add a bit more veg and a little less redundancy. I also wanted to throw in some broccoli florettes for more veg, but my broccoli was bad. Next time I'll probably use enough vegetables to make up the 2 missing breasts, and double the cheese, and use the full can of sauce.

I had to cook it an extra 15 minutes. The chicken was not done after the allotted 50 minutes. The bread crumbs were dry and bland and I even used extra melted butter. And the Swiss cheese was just strange.

Followed this recipe exactly as it stated.  It was so easy and delicious! I served it with egg noodles on the side that were tossed in butter with a bit of Parmesan, along with some corn on the side.  Even my 10 year old daughter loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.

I found it fatty and kind of gross. It was just OK (taste-wise). Then I tried to warm it up the next day and everything  had congealed (all the fat) so when I microwaved the rice with the dry chicken on top I ended up with crusty ick.

We really liked this with a few changes. I butterflied the chicken breasts and shortened the cooking time to about 20 min covered and 15 uncovered. The ratio of topping/sauce to chicken was perfect this way. If I had left the breasts whole, it would have been too bland and a bit dry. I also seasoned the chicken with a garlic seasoning blend along with the pepper, and I mixed the melted butter with the breadcrumbs before sprinkling it on top. Definitely a keeper recipe for busy nights. It was so quick to put together. Next time, I might try adding a slice of ham or prosciutto on top along with the cheese. Switching it up with cream of mushroom soup as others suggested sounds great too!

My husband is a picky eater... However this was a hit... I used mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss... But it was juicy and moist... It's a lot of butter so I wouldn't make it all the time but serves as a wonderful comfort food... Made it with Mac and cheese and roasted green beans ... Amazing

Sorry, this one didn't work for us. I followed the recipe but found that the chicken didn't cook fully (it was still quite pink) and the sauce was gloppy. I ended up taking the part-eaten chicken off our plates and putting it back into the oven without the sauce to bake for another half hour.

LOVED it and so did my husband! So easy to prepare after a long day at work. I did change a couple of things though. I used sliced mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss and I mixed plain breadcrumbs with panko crumbs on the top. Served it with some mixed veggies on top on a bed of linguine . Yum will def make it again!

I've been making this for years, but instead of breadcrumbs I use Pepperidge Farm dressing crumbs and add a bit of white wine to the soup mixture. It's always a hit with the family. Serve with egg noodles and salad.

I have made variations of this for years, also. The Stove Top stuffing really adds to it. I like wine in everything so have also added.
I prefer cream of mushroom soup, too. I could even do without the cheese and I like the idea of the sour cream rather than the milk. Now I've changed the recipe completely...haha

I made this recipe and my husband and I both loved it. I used a can of chicken soup and a can of mushroom soup, with a little more milk, subbed Stove Top stuffing for the bread crumbs, and served it over noodles.

Have to give it five stars just because it's such a good idea.  I didn't have Swiss cheese but I had Mozzarella and parmesan.  I made it as instructed using the Italian cheeses.  Then I added a sprinkle of Garlic powder, just a touch.  I mixed the butter and crumbs as other's suggested and to them added Parmesan and Italian seasoning with a little more garlic powder.  I also cooked the chicken and soup for the half hour, covered and then put the crumbs on till they were browned.  It turned out great.  I want to try it with the Swiss but I think I'd like to slice the breast and slip a slice of ham in the middle.

I made this as is the first time and it was okay. The second time making it I pounded the breast thinner and sprinkled on the herbs and spices we like. I then put them into the casserole dish put 5 Italian cheese blend on top then covered that with fresh green peas and cream of chicken soup 2 cans with milk then topped with a savory herb blend stuffing mix and I mixed the stuffing as per package then topped it on top of the soup and baked for 45 min @ 350 and it was a hit... the meat moist and tender the cheese blend gave a nice flavor and the peas were done and crunchy top along with the stuffing it was a meal in it's self I had made this for a family of 6 with 6 chicken breast and made  a chicken and wild rice blend for a side dish and there were no left overs the  kids said it was just awesome grandma....your the best cook in the world lot's of laughs what come's out of the mouth of babes.... but made this grandma smile.... thanks for sharing!!!!!!!!

This is my daughters new favorite chicken recipe.  The only changes I made  was adding italian seasoning ontop of the chicke breast prior to adding the cheese (my family is a fan of swiss and provolone).

Wonderfully moist!  I omitted the canned soup and substituted with a cup of skim milk and a TBS of flour whisked together.  I followed the suggestions and blended seasoned bread crumbs and butter with a fork until crumbly before topping the chicken breasts.  Fantastic to eat and looked nice in the casserole dish.

Just made this tonight.  Added one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  Took advice from someone who used crushed Ritz crackers and Colby and Cheddar cheese.  This dish was a hit with my family.  Very tasty and moist.  The only thing is it took a lot longer to cook.  I would use tenders next time.

This recipe is similar to one I used years ago for pot lucks ... only difference is that instead of bread crumbs I used Pepperidge Farms Herbed stuffing since that is the recipe given to me at the time.  It is very good and very useful for potlucks.

This was great!  I took some of the other posters advice and added a can of cream if mushroom (I had 6 breasts) and mixed the bread crumbs with butter prior to adding.  A nice dish to add to rotation.

Seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning.  We thought this turned out a little salty from the canned soup, but still tasty.

This is now my favorite recipe, but what's even better is that my girlfriend loved it. I wanted to make something different and delicious for her. Not only that, but I WAS in the dog house ;)
Before going out to buy some of the things I needed, I read some of the reviews on this recipe. I took some pointers from Valerie's Kitchen's and Christina's post/feedback. I used Muenster cheese instead of Swiss cheese, I used a 1/2 cup of 2% low fat evaporated milk, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken, and I also  used LOTS of Stove Top stuffing mix (chicken flavored). For sides I made sweet potatoes (candied yams) and fresh green beans (from thee market's garden). I fried the green beans in light olive oil (extra virgin) and sprinkled chopped onions, salt, and black pepper over them. The sweet potatoes were drowned in cinnamon, brown sugar, butter, and pure can sugar. Mmh mmh mmmmh!!! I'm going to make this again, I know that without a doubt!

This is quite easy and delicious.  I agree that the butter should be mixed with the bread crumbs and less crumbs and slightly more butter.  I didn't like the presentation with dry looking bread crumbs so I added 1/2 can Durkee onion rings  and broiled them for 2 minutes.  Great mouth feel.  So basically I had a green bean casserole with chicken instead of beans.  Will do again.  Abbagran

QUICK AND FANTASTIC

I replaced the Cream of Chicken Soup with Cream of mushroom and added a tin of mushrooms to the soup mixture and increased the milk to 1/3c. It was really good, even my fussy 8 year old grand daughter loved it.  Served it with fresh carrots and backed potatoes.

Very good,I always make it with cream of chicken with herbs because I love the rich flavor of that soup. Also I mix the butter and bread crumbs together before putting on top, other than that I make as is and serve over rice. It is definitely a regular recipe that I use.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tender and flavorful the chicken turned out. I'm usually reluctant to make any recipe that has a can of cream of whatever soup, but decided to give this recipe a try. 

I followed the recipe as written for the most part, but made the following changes and substitutions based on what I had on hand and others' experiences: (1) Sliced the chicken breasts in half on the bias, making two even pieces. (2) Added a teaspoon of onion powder to the cream of chicken soup (3) Sprinkled shredded mozzarella over chicken. (4) Mixed melted butter with bread crumbs along with a teaspoon of italian seasoning before using as a topping for the casserole. 

The only thing I would have changed is letting the crumb topping brown a little more since it tasted a little "bready," according to my husband. Great to find a new, easy recipe for boneless skinless chicken breasts!

The flavor was good, but I probably won't make it again. It was a little bland, and the chicken itself was rubbery in texture. I don't know if that was due to the cooking method, or the quality of the chicken breasts.

I made this recipe on the weekend. I added cheddar cheese because I didn't have swiss and I added stove top stuffing instead of bread crumbs. I put in 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1 cup of milk. OMG, this recipe was amazing. Thank you so much for sharing!!

I will definitely be making this again.  I made this the day before and reheated it at my mom's.  The chicken was still very moist.  It worked very well.  I did use 2 cans of soup and 6 chicken breast instead of 4 only because I had extra mouths to feed.

I made this recipe as described. It was good. This was the juiciest chicken breast I have ever made. The swiss melted off of the breast and pooled around the meat. I barely noticed it was present in the dish. Next time I will use a more moderate cheese. Other than that, the dish was a hit. Long live the Republic!

I gave this 4 stars as written.  I have made it twice, the second time with some adjustments to suit our tastes:   I used sour cream instead of milk, cream of mushroom soup, proscuitto wrapped around the chicken, no salt and a teaspoon of Herbes de Provence added to the soup mixture.  Flavourful and moist!

I just tried this recipe today and I must say it was absolutely delish!  I followed some other commenters suggestion to use dry chicken stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs, and I really think it added an extra plus to it.  The Swiss cheese was excellent paring and the chicken breasts were unbelievably moist and tender!

I enjoy chicken meals so I tried this one. I substituted the cream of mushroom soup 
for a  1 cup of mayonanise and 1 cup of sour cream.  the rest is the same. I serve with rice or noodles. if I use rice I put par cooked rice underneath the chicken and sauce.and it becomes all flavored with the sauce. o sometimes add broccoli on top at baking time. G

This was so easy and SO good! Both my 6yo and my 3yo ate every bite!  The only things I did differently from the original recipe was to add a bit of salt and powdered garlic to the chicken before adding the cheese, which I also added more of.  This will definitely become a staple meal in our house!

This recipe came out great! It was delicious, I did substitute mozzarella for the Swiss chesse due to a allergy! And I took the advice of others and used two cans of soup for the sauce ( one cream of chicken and one of cream of mushroom).

Very good and easy. This was perfect with rice and mixed grill vegetables. I used the stuffing crumbs which gave it added flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Yummy!   I only had provolone, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I used panko breadcrumbs, which are really light and crispy.  The soup, milk, and cheese make a delicious sauce.  I served with noodles and petite peas.  A keeper.

My family LOVES this meal. I've made it many times now. I used 1 cream of Mush and 1 chicken. I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 of milk. I seasoned that mixture with garlic salt, minced onion and pepper. Poured that over the Muenster covered seasoned chicken breasts. This time I used Pepperidge Farm Onion/Sage bread cubes. Using Stove Top makes it *ridiculously* TOO salty. If you have Swiss cheese, use it but the Muenster was ok.

Only 4 stars because I make mine a little different.  I use 1/2 soup can of white wine and mix with the soup, and I put stovetop stuffing croutons on top instead of breadcrumbs, then drizzle butter on top.
So good!

I've used a similar recipe for years, BUT! instead of milk, I use white wine...... be sure to make enough liquid to cover chicken in pan........ the wine makes it good enough for company or holidays!
The sauce is wonderful on rice!

I wasn't that impressed.  It needs something else.  I used cream of broccoli soup and added parsley and tarragon at the end of cooking, but I found it a little bland.

I have been making this recipe for 25 years BUT I ALWAYS brown my chicken first. That's where the flavor is. I also brown a whole diced onion. So,for a really delicate 'gravy' Cream of Celery is my #1 go to of choice. This recipe is always a great family pleaser. Also this recipe works very well with pork steak.

I saw this exact same recipe on this site, but it also included dijon mustard in the sauce. I have made it many times with the mustard, and amount of mustard can be varied for taste. It is both great as a family dinner, and also can easily be made for company and entertaining.

A few changes, cream of mushroom soup, chicken tenders and stove top stuffing drizzled with butter for the topping.

One of our favorites, too!  Except we use Stove Top stuffing (dry) instead of bread crumbs and add fresh mushrooms on top of the chicken.  We have it at LEAST once a month!

I have made this for years! My alterations include diced onion, chopped mushrooms, cream of mushroom soup works as well as cream of chicken, and sherry. A friend uses stovetop stuffing instead of bread crumbs and that is a very tasty exchange for bread crumbs.

I make a dish very similar to this but use white wine instead of milk.  Delicious!  Also, depending on my pantry contents, I might use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

I was so excited to try this recipe because of all the great reviews, but I was sooo disappointed! Even after ADDING seasonings to the chicken breast (garlic powder and poultry seasoning) this was really lacking flavor. Another change I made was to use Stove Top stuffing instead of breading, and the stuffing was the only part of the meal that had flavor. Oh! AND... I added dry sherry to the soup mixture... I had to bring leftovers for my lunch today so that I didn't waste it. I may just have a packet of oatmeal instead...

I just made this recipe for dinner and my kids and husband loved it! I did try some slight changes though. I seasoned the chicken with pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning, all around. I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom, as suggested by many. And I sprinkled the box bread crumbs on top then with home made stuffing. (The butter went into my home made stuffing, along with onions and seasonings.) Came out very moist and the flavored of the soups, mixed, were very tasty! And the stuffing on top was crisp and perfect! Will make this one of our new family favorite meals. Thanks!

Good, easy.  Try sprinkling chip w/garlic powder poultry seasoning, pepper b/4 cheese.  Used Herb & Garlic bread crumbs.

I loved this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add another 1/4 C. of milk to the Soup mixture.  It was a little too thick.  Other than that, it was great.  My boys loved it!  Thanks!

This was fabulous!  I also made modifications being I also used more spices being pepper, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and cayene pepper.  I fried some mushrooms and added on top of the cheese and used 1/2 cup of milk with Cream of Mushroom soup and then Stove Top Stuffing with 3 tbsp of butter on top.  It was incredible. 

Thank you for this very easy and great dish.

Oh my gosh I cannot begin to tell you how yummy and easy this was.  I used more Swiss cheese than called for since I used six piece of thigh meat (not a fan of white meat) and added cubed potatoes for a side which I covered in Stove Top (sage) stuffing instead of regular bread crumbs. My husband said this was the best chicken dish I have ever made.  This is a new family favorite and after the first bite was dubbed a make again meal.  So good!!!

SO easy to make and my family loves this one. I've made it with other cheeses besides swiss and it's good that way too, but I would say swiss is the best. I make this at least a couple times a month. Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe that has become a go to meal in our house.

My family is full of very picky eaters and finding new ways to spice up our menu is pretty hard but this recipe was a big hit! They loved it so much that they asked for it instead of turkey this Thanksgiving. Because they're so picky I did make a few modifications though. I substituted the swiss cheese for mozzarella cheese because I'm the only one who likes swiss, and chicken gravy for the chicken soup. All in all a wonderful recipe that was easy to make and a great new addition to our menu. Thanks!

I made this today for the first time.  I was worried about the negative reviews but found this recipe to be both easy and tasty.  I cooked mine in a average size oval (Pampered Chef covered baker) dish that held all the chicken snugly so the soup mix did not just run off the chicken.  The only substitution I mads was the cheese, I used mozzarella cheese because that is what I had.  It was wonderful and I will make it again!

This recipe is awesome!  To make it Weight Watcher friendly and with only 8 WW pts +, use light mayo, skim milk, 2% Swiss cheese, healthy request cream of chicken soup, Land O' Lakes light canola oil oleo,  and 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of 1 cup.  Still tastes great!

I was a little hesitant about the swiss cheese in this recipe, but my family loved it. There wasn't the strong swiss cheese flavor that I expected. Instead it blended perfectly with the other ingredients. Chicken generally doesn't have much flavor, but in this recipe, the flavor was wonderful and no one flavor dominated. The swiss cheese blended into the other ingredients, and became more of a flavoring for the cream sauce and chicken. I think the long bake time worked to blend everything. The only change that I made was to use Kraft Oven Fry for Chicken instead of the bread crumbs.  I will definitely be making this again!

It was ok; but i don't want it again. i think i am spoiled to the Hellman's chicken breasts which is way better and easier with only 4 ingredients!Also, it is more moist.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I substitute cooking sherry for the milk, and I like to use dry stuffing mix on top.  Sometimes I use mushroom soup instead of the chicken.  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I also modified, using some other reviews.  I used Colby Jack cheese because I don't like Swiss.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup of sherry.  I omitted the sugar as well.  I mixed Italian seasoned bread crumbs with Panko, and it formed a nice crust.  I also cooked it for over an hour because I wanted to make sure the chicken was cooked through.  I served with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good,but made some changes too. Used muenster cheese instaed of swiss. I imagine you can use any cheese to your liking, gouda would be good so would provolone. Instead of milk I used a can of 1/2 & 1/2, and also used proscuitto. With the bread crumbs, we used panko, put them in a pan with butter, then on top of the chicken. Real comfort food, turned out great

Love this feel-good recipe!  Made mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy.  Will maybe add an extra can next time to give a bit more.  Overall, great dinner on a chilly autumn night.

I have been making this recipe (with minor changes) for years, our family affectionately dubbed it "Gooey Chicken."  My minor changes are substituting wine for the milk and seasoned stuffing mix (Pepperidge Farm) for the topping.  I also mix the butter with the topping before  putting it on the casserole as it bakes up more evenly and crisper.  It is a family favorite and a crowd pleaser every time.

Great recipe.....used my crockpot and got rave reviews from the hubby! Used garlic and herb breadcrumbs and velveeta white shreds......I also used the cream of chicken soup with herbs........turned out great altho the breadcrumbs did not come out toasted of course but you could broil them for a minute if that is important to you!

This was very good BUT I live at 9500 feet and it took me an extra hour to cook, so next time I will cook this at 375 and add an extra 10 mins during the cover time and the uncover time. I also used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and the stove top stuffing...Yummy...

Very easy to make, but our family felt it was very bland tending to a not so pleasant taste. It was unanimous that this was a one timer.

Our family has made variations of this yummy recipe over the years.  My aunt made it for my baby shower back in 1982!!!  I make this fairly often; it is a family favorite.  I like the suggestion of using chicken flavored stove top stuffing...am going to do this next round!

I have made this many times but instead of milk I use sherry or Marsala. I also use a couple extra slices of Swiss and give it a full cover of stuffing mix. Good enough to serve to guests!

I have been making this recipe for 20 years. It's my go to recipe. I have aways used the chicken soup but with just a little milk. I also add sliced mushrooms on the chicken than add the cheese.Then the soup and sprinkle a couple hand fulls of Petridge Farms crushed stuffing on top of that,then the margerin.

I've made this recipe for years, with a few changes. 1 can of condensed cream of chicken, 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom (you can use the low fat style), more Swiss cheese (enough to put an entire layer across the chicken - the processed cheese is the best, makes a creamier sauce) and I use Stove Top chicken stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. Serve it with rice and steamed broccoli. The extra soup and cheese makes more sauce to put over the rice and broccoli. It's a family favorite!

I really liked this recipe.  My family doesn't tend to like recipes that require a can of soup but it was a hit with everyone.  I changed it up a bit....I pounded the chicken, so it would be more tender and thin. I used Cajun spice and I grilled some onions and put it on top of the sauce.  Also, instead of drizzling the butter over top, I added it to the bread crumbs.  It was delicious.

This recipe is similar to one I use known as Swiss Chicken.  I add 1/3 cup of dry white wine instead of milk to my version and use Stovetop brand herbed chicken stuffing mix instead of plain dry bread crumbs.  I occasionally sub cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken soup...just depends on my tastebuds at the time! DH loves it either way! Delicious served with rice or egg noodles!

This is a quick and easy recipe for the new cook with canned soup.  The breadcrumbs need some butter to make them really good as without this the crumbs just sit on top very dry and tasteless.  I love chicken and I love swiss but they should NOT be used together in this dish.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!.  I used a little butter, but replaced most of what the recipe called for with olive oil, added Locatelli cheese, prosciutto and I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  Will definitely make this dish again!

Edible. Otherwise, my husband and I were pretty disappointed with the lack of flavor. Needless to say, we thought it was bland.

Man this was so easy and good!!  Like others who've reviewed this recipe and had suggestions, I too suggest that you add another can of soup, and stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.  I also served it with rice, and found that the extra soup gave me more sauce for the rice. Oh, and I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts... I like to get two pieces of chicken that are more manageable to eat, and they're thinner than a breast.  Keeper!!!

These were just ok. The flavor wasn't anything spectacular. I used 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken, shredded cheddar and I seasoned the chicken breasts with adobo, garlic powder and pepper. I also mixed the butter with breadcrumbs before sprinkling them on top.

I had an extra chicken breast to get rid of and tried this recipe.  Simple, easy and excellent!  I flattened the chicken breasts, used cheddar instead of swiss cheese, and added some sliced green olives as a topping.  When I make this again, I may try white wine instead of milk.

Pretty yummy dish.  I did add some extra spices to the seasoning of the chicken because I feared it would be bland, but other than that, I followed it exactly and had my son and husband lapping it up!  Quick and easy too.

I made this tonight for dinner.  This was an excellent dish!!  My 3yr old loved it too.  The only change I made was using crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs and I took the advice of another post and I mixed the crackers and butter together then topped it.  Everything was really good and I am definitely keeping this recipe thanks for the post..

Pure comfort food!! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a box of chicken stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  Then I doubled the "cream" sauce using 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1/2 cup of milk and poured it generously over the top of the stuffing.  I do agree it was a tad on the salty side, but I think that's due to the stuffing I choose to use.  But I had to eat seconds even though I was full after my first serving!!  It was wonderful!!!  Yummmmmm and EASY!!

This has become a family favorite in my house! I added a slice of deli ham on top of the chicken breasts before adding the swiss cheese and it's like an easy "mock" chicken cordon bleu! I also suggest mixing the bread crumbs with the melted butter before sprinkling over the top.

Chicken breasts prepared according to this recipe were just ordinary- not bad but nothing to rave about either. Personally i found them quite bland.

I tried this recipe on the family and they just loved it.  I did however moderate it a little I used some garlic salt, poultry seasoning on the chicken and stove top herb stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.  I also increased the wet ingredients to 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup mix and doubled the milk requierment

Not for me.  A little too bland for my taste.  Easy to make though and the ingredients were easy to find.  But didn't make me say w.o.w...

Perfect.  Easy. The only change I made was cutting the breasts in half lengthwise so they wouldn't be so thick. This was fantastic.

It was yummy and we are adding it to our weeknight meals.  Chicken was really moist.  I think I might cut my chicken breasts in half and add more cheese.  But truly, no changes are required.

Not bad but not great. After reading reviews about lack of flavor I added fresh lemon juice to the chicken, extra cheese, garlic salt, and ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. It still tasted like I had just dumped a can of cream of chicken soup on a chicken breast which was a little disappointing. I think the cream of chicken soup overpowered the dish, and I am a person who loves a lot of sauce in most cases.

very delicious, my whole family loved this, as suggested above I used chicken stuffing instead of bread crumbs. We had plenty of left overs( I cook for 15 people) so a couple days later I cooked three cups of rice added 3cups of chicken broth and then cut the left overs up and added the chicken and the soup mixture to it. The whole family loved this as well>

I made this tonight for dinner and used two chicken breast cut in half width wise! Followed all directions completely, chicken is very tender, but needs some extra seasoning! I did mix the bread crumbs and butter as others did! I liked breadcrumbs kids DID NOT!!! It was pretty good, will make again with no bradcrumbs and more seasoning!!!

Quick and simple. I used half/half since I didn't have milk, low sodium soup, and whole wheat breadcrumbs. The chicken was super moist!

omg this is the easiest thing ever and tastes great!!!!  you can't mess this up, it is so good and easy.  i have made it several times and it always comes out perfect.  you can use cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup instead if you want and any kind of cheese you like or whatever you have on hand.  comes out perfect every time.  i always make home made bread crumbs (easy-20 seconds in the blender) and mix them with them butter and spoon over the chicken and sauce.  i serve over pasta with the extra sauce and my kids and my bf ask for seconds every time.  you can't go wrong!

Really easy, but it takes awhile to make.  Ingredients are largely things that should be in the pantry anyway.  I used shredded mozzarella instead of Swiss.

Good basic recipe.  I doubled it for our family of 5 and used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of the bread crumbs because it was what I had on hand.  All in all, a recipe worth repeating.

Delicious and super easy! My family devoured this. The chicken was so tender. I used stuffing on top instead of bread crumbs as a reviewer suggested. Great Idea! I also increased the amount of sauce and thinned it out a little by adding additional milk.

I liked this recipe a lot but my husband just thought it was okay.  I used Stove Top instead of bread crumbs per reviewer's suggestions and husband thought it was too salty and a bit dry.  Maybe I will try it again with more milk and bread crumbs instead.

THis is my first dish ever being made here on allrecipes.com. The only change I amde to the recipe was to season the chicken prior to cooking. I seasoned it with a little curry, seasonall, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Overall, to me the sauce was a little too thick. Next time I will use more milk. My husband however, LOVED it just the way it was.. Very easy and great for a first time meal!!!

This was so easy and tastes amazing.  I used stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and spread herbs (poultry seasoning - thyme, sage, rosemary, cracked black pepper, sea salt) on the chicken before I put the cheese on.  This a going in our regular rotation.  If you don't like swiss cheese try substituting whatever cheese you DO like - the dish is very versatile and easy to prepare.   I served this over egg noodles with sweet peas on the side but it could easily be served with white or wild rice and the veggies could be layered in the pan on top of the cheese (but under the sauce) if you want - again, this sauce is versatile enough that you could use any veggie you choose - peas, corn, broccoli, even a bit of spinach.

I would alter it next time I made it.  But now I know what to do!  This was very good and we had NO leftovers... There's a number of ways to add your own touch to this simple recipe.  I would sautee onions and garlic first in olive oil - then pour it ontop of the cheese/chicken breasts.  Then put the bread crumbs (stove top) and soup mixture.  Definately needed a little more milk like one review said.  All in all - DELICIOUS!

Pretty good.  I used Stovetop stuffing fully prepared on top instead of the bread crumbs and that was nice.  If anything, the chicken seemed a little dry and boring on bites where you didn't get the sauce, but it was overall good and easy!

EXCELLENT!  I didn't have the soups, so used the sauce from a packaged (gasp!) Herb Chicken mix -- worked great!

I made this exactly as directed and it was wonderful. I did have to mix the crumb sauce mixture up a bit when all was finished but still a great easy dish, real comfort food :)

We loved this.  I followed another reviewer's advice and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and poultry seasoning -- also used meunster instead of cheddar.  I used an entire box of Stove Top stuffing.  I will definitely make this again and play with the ingredients to switch it up.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not like this  recipe. it was too bland for may taste. I didn't tweak it any but I should have. My husband liked it because he's diabetic & maintains a no-salt, no sugar diet. I should have added salt. My adult daughter didn't like it either. She told me not to try it again.

My husband and 3 yr old son loved this! I personally didn't like the swiss. I didn't know until I made this I wasn't a fan of swiss cheese. Other than that though it was delicious. I think next time I will try it with slices of provolone.

It was something different and very good. I thought it was just a teeny tiny salty, but I'm pretty sure that's something that can be fixed, no problem. I will definitely make this again, my boyfriend loved it.

Delicious! My boyfriend loved this dish. I think it was the cheese that gave it that different flavor. As other readers suggested, I used dry (stove top brand) stuffing in place of the bread crumbs and all I had on hand was cream of celery soup but it came out fantastic. Thank you for sharing!

Both me and my boyfriend really enjoyed this recipe and it has been moved from recipes to try to TOP RECIPES and we'll make it often. The only thing I noticed in the recipe was that it didn't have any seasoning besides black pepper so I added white pepper, garlic salt, dill, oregano and parsley. It was fantastic.

I use stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and typically make a lot of sauce just for dipping, but this is great! Really hits the spot when you want a little comfort food. I've made it several times to really excellent reviews!

So . . . I made this with things I had on hand.  I used skinless chicken thighs.  Didn't have any soup, so I used a couple packages of gravy mix.  I put the chicken in the baking pan and put the swiss cheese on top.  then I put half of the gravy, half a package of stuffing mix and the rest of the gravy. Oh, I also put 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary on the chicken before the cheese.  It was delish!!!  Even my picky husband said it was great.

I used this for a potluck and everyone scarfed it! I only used 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, and took the advice of another reviewer and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the chicken. I felt it was a little salty so only 4 stars, but really, really quite good and easy for after work dinners! Thanks!

I love this dish. I have made it several times and have found that I like it best with some modifications. I season the chicken with pepper and italian seasonings. Then cover each breast with a slice or two of proscuitto and a healthy sprinkling of shredded mozzarella cheese before covering with cream of asparagus soup mixture.

It was really good..but next time, I will probably add another can of the cream of chicken soup. I served it over egg noodles, and with just one can, there wasn't really enough sauce for the noodles. But other than that, really delicious!

This is SO yummy! I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. I also used less bread crumbs than indicated in the recipe and supplemented the bread crumbs with a thin layer of French's onions. So, so good! I will definitely make this recipe again soon!

This has become my families favorite! I always put extra mushrooms in the soup mix. Instead of swiss cheese I use a mixed blend or cheddar. Also, you can top the breasts w/ham, bacon, spinach..the ideas are limitless and it's always great!

So I really like dthis recipe, but made a few modifications of my own (based on other reviews).  Diced the chicken Added mushrooms to the chicken Spiced with granulated garlic Used Meunster cheese Added French Fried Onions to topping Used the Chicken Stove Top Stuffing  These changes added some flavor and really made it an even better dish.

This recipe is delicious and super easy! My family loved it and I plan to make it again. I did however make a few subtitutions that work just as well -- I didn't have any milk on hand so I used evaporated, and used cheddar cheese condensed soup instead of cream of chicken. Also in addition to the breadcrumbs I crushed up about 15 cheddar flavored FlipSides crackers which added lots of flavor. Great easy recipe that doesn't take a lot of time to prepare. I loved it!

I doubled the sauce and added 1 cup of beef broth (didn't have chicken) and 1/2 C red wine (had it left over from company).  I cooked the chicken from frozen with chunks of carrots and potatoes and flipped the chicken breasts over every 20 minutes for a total of an hour at 425.  When cooking was finished, I removed all of the chicken and veggies and added 1/2 cup of cream cheese and stirred until melted and spooned the sauce over each individual portion.  Yum!

My boyfriend and I make this meal every week, with a few little tweaks here and there.  One time I added Rice a Roni and another week I added canned green beans.  We've also used cream of mushroom in lieu of cream of chicken, but we prefer the latter.  This is a great recipe and I'm SOOO glad I came across it.

Everyone loved this.  I only had italian bread crumbs though and used half a cup.  It turned out great and the chicken was moist.  My husband said it reminded him of chicken cordon bleu.

My family and I LOVE this chicken. I did however, make some changes. They are as follows. I use provolone for the cheese, and Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. And we even omitted the milk last time. I wouldn't omit the milk again but this is one of our favorites!

This was so good and easy, too! The changes I made were to use cheddar jack cheese (what I had on hand) and I doubled the soup/milk (using one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken). Oh, and I did season the chicken first with paprika, garlic & onion powders, parsley & pepper. I put it under the broiler the last 6-8 minutes, at the suggestion of some reviewers and it browned perfectly. Next time I would mix the bread crumbs (I did user less) with the melted butter first. Even my husband, who is not wild over creamy recipes, really liked this and had seconds. :)

I followed others advice and used two cans of soup.  We did not like this.  My chicken was a purple color.  I kept waiting for it to brown and it didn't happen.  It looked raw, but was cooked.  ODD!!!!!

BASED ON ANOTHER MEMBERS ADVICE I ALSO ADDED 2 CANS OF CONDENSED CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP AND DOUBLED THE LIQUID SO IT WOULDN'T BE SO SALTY.  I ADDED 2 BOXES OF STOVE TOP STUFFING.  WONDERFUL.

This recipe is pretty easy to make and tastes good too!! I substituted muenster for the swiss, used condensed milk and added a bit more milk to the cream of chicken soup (I also used a fat-free soup). I topped it with Stove Top and added shredded Parmesan right before it was done baking. In the future I would add a bit more butter but overall it was easy and delicious!

This was OK, be sure to serve WITH the gravy on top of the chicken.  The gravy will 'slip' off of the chicken during cooking, and this is where all of the flavor of this dish is.

Delicious, the whole family loved it. It was quick and easy. I used provolone and my favorite spices. I also mixed the garlic and herb bread crumbs with the butter before putting on top. I will definitely use this often! Thank You!

This is so easy and so good!  I recommend pounding the chicken halves before placing in a dish.  I agree with others that this can be modified easily to add other flavors that you like.  This will be going in our regular rotation, my two children ate it right up!

This is a great recipe! So creamy and flavorful! I used Farmers cheese instead of swiss. Farmers cheese is just a lot creamier and melts well. I also used cream of chicken with herbs. Delicious!

I love this recipe.  It is an easy meal, but tastes great! The only real variation we do is I use parmesan cheese.  I always forget to get swiss cheese and normally have parmesan on hand.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and an extra slice of cheese to each chicken breast.  Next time I'll also mix the breadcrumbs and melted butter together.  This was very flavorful and delicious. Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe. Very flavorful but my favorite part is that it is quick and easy to make. I microwave some bacon and add it under the cheese before baking. I've tried both stovetop stuffing, and panko bread crumbs. They were both delicious but in the future, I will probably only use the panko. I also mixed the crumbs with the butter before adding it, flavored the chicken with goya adobo (at my bf's request) and broiled the whole thing at the end for just 8 mins since mine wasn't browing to my satisfaction when following the recipe instructions.

This is much better than the standard pan cooked version of this recipe. The chicken was so moist and tender. I used provolone cheese instead of Swiss. I salted the chicken along with peppering it. And I doubled the soup and milk. I thought that a whole cup of bread crumbs would have been too much, but it was perfect. My husband thought it was very good, but a little rich. The rest of us thought it was perfect.

I dusted the chicken breasts with garlic powder and added a splash of sherry to the soup/milk mix. Other than that, I followed the directions as is and it turned out great.

It's a great quick fix on the fly, however it was a little bland and the texture could have been more complex.

This recipe was delicious! I did add 1 T of mustard and 1/2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture to add a little zip and I followed the advice of fellow reviewers and melted the butter together with the bread crumbs. Overall, very moist and tasty!

This recipe was quick, easy, a delicious. I used a chipotle cheddar cheese instead of swill and I used italian seasoned break crumbs because that's what i happened to have around. Turned out wonderfully.

Wonderful way of having chicken breasts! I added two cans of soup, instead of the one, because I wanted to make sure it wasn't too dry (used cream of chicken and cream of celery). Added a bit of vermouth and extra milk to the gravy mixture so that it was a little less soup-thick and more gravy thick, if you know what I mean. Also, seasoning the chicken breasts before covering them is a must! I believe. I used the ground pepper as suggested by the recipe, but also added garlic powder and 'poultry seasonings' ie, sage, parsely, oregano, & thyme. I think this really helps the chicken flavour. I used a box of stove top bread crumbs with the flavor/spice packet mixed in and there was more than enough. It was such a great combo - soft, moist chicken with crunchy on top breadcrumbs! Yum!! Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe, and my boyfriend loved it!  I adjusted it only slightly.  I used 2 cans of soup for extra sauce, and added 2 small cans of mushrooms just before pouring soup over top. Used 2 slices swiss on each breast, and   took the advice of another reviewer and put bacon slices (soft cooked) just under the swiss cheese.. gave great extra flavor.  Also I had some seasoned breadcrumb/stuffing/shredded fresh parmesan/fresh garlic mixture from another recipe, so that's what I used for the bread crumb part.  The chicken comes out so moist and good.  Served it over wide egg noodles.

They were alright. Next time I would mix the melted butter into the bread crumbs. Also I would probably add less of the cream mix on the chicken because it seem to just run off with the cheese while it baked. It is a good "starting" point recipe for other variations.

This recipe was great. My husband loved it and he is the hardest to please. He said it didn't need the breadcrumbs. However, I think they added a nice touch. We did add the prociuto and also mixed the breadcrumbs and butter before topping. Excellent and will make again.

This is a great chicken dish.  So easy, it's perfect for busy week nights.  I used provolone as I didn't have any swiss.  Turned out very yummy.  Cooked up some egg noodles to put the chicken and sauce one.

Wow, very very savory.  I used lowfat cream of chicken and it was still really really good.  Made a judgment call on the amount of bread crumbs...only used 1/2 cup since 1 cup seemed like an excess. Husband raved.

I must have done something wrong.  This was not pleasing to the eye, however it did taste good.  I think it called for too much bread crumbs.  My husband and I was scrapping it off just to see the chicken. I think I will attempt again without the bread crumbs and add water for a thinner gravy.

This recipe was very simple to make and very good.  I would rate it maybe 4.5 stars, but it was a little bland. It needs a bit more flavor. I also used medium cheddar cheese rather than swiss.  The sauce was really good though.  I think it would be good over rice.

Mine didn't look anything like the picture but it was pretty tasty! I added onion powder, garlic powder, season salt and italian seasoning to the chicken then topped with cream of chicken soup, milk and sour cream (about 1/4 cup).  I also mixed the butter and bread crumbs before topping the chicken.  I thought this was a super easy weeknight dinner and will definitely make again!

I made this recipe last night pretty close to the original and it was great.  I marinated the chicken in a plastic bag w/ the cream of chicken soup, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder approx. one hour prior to baking.  I also substituted the swiss cheese for mozzerella and provolone.

This was WONDERFUL and so easy.  Perfect for cooking Monday after work dinner. I stuck to the recipe, but did use the stove top for topping.  I was out of bread crumbs.  We all loved it.  This recipe goes in my rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly delicious. I also seasoned the chicken well before adding the other ingredients. Based on other comments I used stuffing/dressing instead of breadcrumbs. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I followed an altered version (as mentioned by others) and was very happy with the results.  I added mushrooms, used Muenster cheese, herbed up the chicken and used shredded parmesan on top of crushed and herbed stuffing mix.  The only thing that could have been better is the breaded portion...I think I would use less or add more butter.  Good stuff overall.  The man in my life enjoyed it!

My husband claims to only like his chicken fried.  However, he thought this was very good. Some say it is a little bland. I used cream of chicken soup with herbs and thought it was just perfect! I also flattened the breasts a little and covered the top with Swiss cheese - using 1-1/2 slices. Very moist - very good!!!!!!!

Good base recipe, but needs some spice or flavor. I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and 1/4 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture and added Seasoning Salt when peppering the chicken and it was still a little bit bland. I did use Provelone instead of Swiss though and Swiss has a more distinct flavor, so that might have made a difference. Overall, it's a great base recipe.

This recipe is great. I've made it for my family five times now, and they love it! We never have Swiss cheese around, so I use pepper jack, and instead of Cream of Chicken soup I use Campbells Cream of Mushroom. It comes out so juicy and flavorful, I love it!

I liked this because it was simple and relatively fast.  As fast as chicken can be and still be moist anyway.  I substituted sour cream in for the milk and used stuffing instead of bread crumbs.  I also used a bit too much pepper and I wouldn't use garlic salt on the chicken... it came out a bit saltier than disired.  I will also use poultry seasoning again.  Gave it a nice touch.

This would certainly be bland made as is. I subbed stuffing mix for the bread crumbs, sprinkled the chicken with poultry seasoning and added half a bag of frozen veggies to the pan. Next time I think I will add some garlic powder to the soup mixture. Quick and easy, ideal for weeknight.

This is one of our favorite all-time chicken recipes. So tasty and easy to make! I highly recommend substituting stuffing (like Stove Top) in place of the bread crumbs. Also, I tried one of the other reviewer's suggestions -- using sour cream instead of milk. It turned out great!

Very easy (especially on a work night) and tasty...I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and muenster cheese. I seasoned the breasts wth garlic salt and pepper. It was delicious, I was very surprised. And filling. I will make again.

We all really liked this and it was quick and simple to make. I took advice from others and seasoned the chicken with salt, garlic powder and onion powder before adding the cheese. I did everything else as it called and then added a little garlic powder on the very top. 30 mins covered and then 20 mins uncovered turned out perfect. I made three larger breasts and used a glass baking dish that they fit perfectly in the bottom of so the sauce didn't spread out. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good stuff, instead of Swiss cheese I put grated Mozzarella on and I subbed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup & sprinkled some grated Parmesan on top.

SO EASY.  I should've read the reviews first though.  I will definitely try crackers or stuffing on top next time.  Maybe 1 1/2 slices of cheese next time.  Added some garlic powder too.  Way too many bread crumbs.  But I will try again because the kids didn't make faces.  Served with cauliflower and there was enough sauce to dip that in which was yummy.  thanks.

I've made this recipe countless times so thought it's time to rate it. I've followed others' suggestions as well and substituted pepper jack cheese, a little dry vermouth for the extra suggest milk and used Stove Top stuffing for the crumbs. Everyone, family and guests alike love this dish as full-flavored comfort food. Simple ingredients always on hand mean I can put this on the table without a special trip to the store.

My husband really liked it.  Next time I'll use a 8 inch square pan so there's less room for the sauce and topping to fall off.  I only used 1/2 cup crumbs and it was still enough.

This was fantastic!  My family absolutely loved it.  I only had cream of mushroom garlic soup but it worked out fine.  My kids asked me to make it again 3 days later.  Yummo!

Very good dish. I used 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs and 1 cup of crushed crackers as suggested by others on here. I will make again but with less crackers. Everyone ate this up. Thanks

i was expecting so much more, i took some of the advice of previous posters, but this really just turned out bland and uninspired -- it's nothing special. the recipe on the back of any breadcrumb container would do you better.

Love this recipe, it's a favorite in my house now! We prefer it with stuffing rather than bread crumbs, and ALWAYS use 2 pieces of cheese for each breast. Soo yummy!

tastes very good, but the bread crumbs did not work out well. next time I will make it without the bread crumbs, and serve it with stuffing.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and thyme. it was tasty.

this is a keeper, very easy. I covered this for the first 20min, next time I will bake it uncovered, the chiken was a bit rubbery. I also used a chucky salsa which was nice. I will serve this with tortilla's next time and salad no rice or beans this will keep the carbs lower. Great taste and very easy.Will make this again. Thanks for this great recipe. Heidi

I thought this was pretty yummy.  I followed some of the suggestions to season the chicken and used poultry seasoning on them, along with the black pepper.  I also increased the milk to 1/3 cup.  I thought this was good and my husband and 1-year old loved it too.  I will make it again with the mentioned changed.

I made this directly from the recipe and would say it's just "ok." My husband said not to fix it again for him. The chicken breast was very bland. It definitely needed more than just pepper. I would recommend adding some garlic salt. It was overall pretty bland.

I was sick and my stomach hurt. I threw this together and sat down while it cooked. It was really good, a comfort food. I didn't even make any side dishes, I left hubby to fend for himself. I put 1 chicken breast in a bowl and ate it. It made my tummy feel better. Good sick food. Made the medication go down easy.

This recipe was good. I only had chicken cutlets and think it would have been best to wait and use regular thickness boneless. The cutlets were too thin and chicken was a bit on the dry side.

All I can say is "Mm Mm GOOD!".  This is a fabulous recipe, and very easy to prepare.  Not sure why you add the cheese, but it tastes like chicken, stuffing, and gravy--all in one dish!

Came out excellent.  Substituted smoked provolone for the swiss.  Topped each breast with 1/2 strip bacon.  Oddly didn't have any milk in the fridge so substituted cream.  It turned out great, though not exactly low fat.

My b/f loved this.  Unfortunately, I  had to take a star away because I did not like the bread crumbs on top at all!  Otherwise it was very flavorful.  I seasoned the chicken to my taste with garlic and onion powder, parparika, pepper, and adoboe.  I also replaced the regular cream of chicken soup with cream of chicken and HERB as another rater suggested.  This soup made it really good.  Thanks submitter.

This was a good recipe.  I used about 3/4 of a cup of the bread crumbs.  1 cup would have been too much.  I used about 6 Tbs. of butter to get all of the bread crumbs covered.  It
could have used a little zip, like some chopped onion and green pepper.  The chicken was nice and moist and I liked the gravy/sauce that the cream of chicken soup made.  I'll make
it again with the zipping it up ingredients.  Thank you.

I tried this dish with only a few changes: a little more milk (closer to a half cup) in order to get the consistency I wanted, no butter on top, and a small amount (1/4 teaspoon or less) of nutmeg. This Savory Chicken was an instant favorite! I served it over white rice, which was good, but next time will try with mashed potatos with the sauce for gravy. Thanks Lori!

I'm going to have to disagree with the majority opinion here. This recipe really didn't work for me. The cheese melted completely into the souce, and the whole thing turned into a gooey mess, with the bread crumbs, soup, butter, and cheese running together. I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out like I expected. The chicken was still tender, and it was still edible, but it wasn't great.

I really loved this recipe but not everyone liked the bread crumbs. The chicken breast were very moist and the soup made a great topping for rice. I will deffinately make again with fewer bread crumbs.

My husband and sons loved this. I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used sharp cheddar. Yummy!

We loved this.  I used 98% fat-free COM, and a little less breadcrumbs and butter.  My husband had seconds (this is a very big deal since he doesn't like bs breasts).  I used a digital thermometer to insure the meat stayed moist.

I tried this recipe with a couple of changes. Instead of using cream of chicken soup, I used a can of chicken broth and 1 cup of half and half.  I also sprinkled parmesan over the top and baked for 1 hours. I uncovered the chicken and topped with chedder fried onions and cooked 15 minutes more.  Great flavor and thick sauce for hash browns. I would rate this receipe as is a 4, but with a little tweaking you can make it a 5.

This recipe was the best.  I read other reviews and used different cheese on all pieces. It was sooo goood.  I misread the recipe and added a can of condensed milk and it was still great.  My husband said a definate keeper. I even e-mail to my mom and sister.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Good recipe.  I made this with American cheese because I was out of swiss and it tasted good.  I used 4 lg. chicken breasts and the only suggestion i have is to use more cheese.  Thanks!

This was YUMMY!  The only thing I changed was instead of bread crumbs, I used cracker crumbs.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This recipe is very tasty. I used cream of chicken soup with herbs instead of the regular one.  I also used italian bread crumbs mixed with the melted butter.  The chicken was wonderful and very juicy and the sauce was very flavorful.  We had this with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy.  Yummy!  All in all this is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

These wer quite good, although very salty. I scaled the recipe down to 2 chicken breasts, but left the sauce as-is. I also layers the dish: chicken, sauce, fredsh mushrooms, sauce, breadcrumbs. Lastly, I shredded the swiss cheese and mixed it in with the breadcrumbs for a crispy-cheesy toping. All in all, a very good home-cooked comfort food type meal.
