I did this recipe with only 2 lamb shoulder round chops.  I altered the recipe and added 1/3 cup honey to the egg and Worchestshire mix.  I used flavored bread crumbs instead of plain.  I cooked them on one side for 20 minutes and then turned them over and drizzled honey on them and cooked for another 20 minutes.  They turned out juicy and delicious!  Very similar to the lamb I had at a beloved Morroccan restaurant in San Francisco.  Will definetly do again!

I had some lamb chops in the freezer that needed to be used and this recipe did the trick!  As other users suggested, I used half soy and half worcestershire sauce and marinated the chops in the egg mixture for about 1/2 hour before cooking.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic powder and a bit of fresh-grated parmesan to the coating.  I baked for a total of about 35 minutes and the chops came out wonderfully tender and flavorful - really delicious!  I will definitely make again and may try this same mix on pork chops as well. Just to update this review - I used this recipe with pork chops this week and it was great! The first time my baked pork chops have come out tender and juicy!

My husband (the lamb lover) goes crazy over this recipe.  I do add 2 tbspn dried parsley to the bread crumbs & lightly spinkle with Lawry's meat seasoning for a flavor boost.  It turns out perfect every time (although cook time may vary according to thickness of the chops - cook to 170 for med. rare or 180 for medium.)

easy to make!!, the kids liked it. didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I subsituted with soy sauce it came out very good. The only thing I would suggest is spraying down the pan maybe with a little Pam so the chops don't stick.

I added oregano, garlic powder, pepper, and Chef Paul's Poultry Magic. It came out very good and very easy to make. Next time I will reduce cooking time by 15 so the lamb chops are medium rare. The 40 mins the recipe calls for made them turn out well done.

This was my second attempt at lamb. the first time was a complete disaster but the  it wasn't great. so i was very pleased with this dish. i added honey to the egg mixture as well as a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick. just remember not to cover when you put in the oven or the bread crumbs won't crisps. overall a good dish, i will make again.

These were the simple answer to what my husband and I were looking for.  I am not sure why other users had a complaint about them not being crispy though, these were juicy, crisp and very tasty right out of the oven!  Amazingly quick and easy to prepare.  I would like to try flavoured bread crumbs next time!  Thank you!

Very tasty. A very simple and tasty way to serve lamb. I used shoulder chops which tasted good but next time, I will spend the extra money and get chops...much easier to eat, I think. I also added garlic to the egg mixture which added a nice flavour. Next time, I think I will add a bit of rosemary too. Excellent.

generic recipe...overall not bad but doesn't bring out the flavor of lamb specifically...could be used on beef or (without the Worcestershire) chicken.  they were very moist though...i would suggest checking the chops at 10 minutes rather than 20 before turning...i did 15 and 15 and they were well done...i prefer my lamb a little redder.

I didn't have much time to prepare my chops and chose this recipe as I had all the ingredients on hand. It was very good. I think the next time I will brown the breaded chops first before baking only to crisp up the breading a little more :)

4 stars because I personally did not absolutely love it, but my husband enjoyed it a great deal-- that always makes it better :).  after reading kdevitt's review I ventured to combine both soy and worstichire (sp?) sauce with the egg mixture and crushed caesar salad crutons and mixed them with italian seasoned bread crumbs for the dry mixture.  additionally, (after seasoning the lamb chops with Lowry's season salt) i added sweet basil, parsley, and oregano to the bread crumb mixture.  the varied texture of crushed crutons and more finely consistent bread crumbs made for just the right amount of crunchy.  the honey drizzle halfway thru and after the flip was a nice touch as well.  will most likely do again.  welcomed change from skillet preparation!

Tonight the first time I've ever prepared lamb chops, and I loved them!  I followed kdevitt's suggestion and added honey to the egg mix, and drizzled more over then lamb when I flipped the chops halfway through their time in the oven.  For the breading, I used 2 parts bread crumbs and 1 part grated parmesan cheese with about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  The parmesan adds a slight nutty flavor, and paired with the sweetness of the honey I was more than pleased with the results.  I served mine with grilled peaches and cinnamon-sugar gnocchi -- I will definitely make this meal again!

This was so easy and the lamb came out fantastic! Very tender and favorful. I added a small amount of honey to the egg and worchestershire marinade and used seasoned breadcrumbs to dredge in. Served the chops w/ couscous, tabouli, hummus and warm pita.... the meal got a big YUM from everyone at the table. Thanks for the recipe that is now my favorite way to cook lamb chops!

My family loved this recipe!  I usually don't eat lamb like my husbands likes to but, prepared this way I loved them.  They were scrumptious and tender.  My 7 year old liked them too.  I would make one suggestion, season the lamb with a little salt first to try to add some extra flavor to the lamb because lamb seems to be so flavorless. Also, I used store bought garlic and herb bread crumbs and they turned out great. But, overall we enjoyed this and this will be my new recipe for making lamb chops.

Delicious!  I only had 3 lamb chops so I only used 1 egg, 1t Worcestershire, & 1t soy sauce.  I let the chops marinate for 30 min, then coated them with Italian bread crust.  I did add some extra garlic powder, rosemary, thyme to the crumbs.  I baked for approx 30 min, turning half way thru.  They were so tender you could almost cut them with a knife.  Great with a glass of red wine.

I marinated 1" chops in worchestshire, soya sauce with rosemary and minced garlic.Then coated the chops in egg and Panko crumbs (available at an Asian market). The rosemary and garlic added something I think would have been missing other wise. Cooked for about 40 min. They were perfectly cooked. (I tented them and let them sit for a few min.)Tender and juicy.

Thank you!! Finally, a recipe that makes lamb chops tender, juicy, and flavorful.  All other recipes I've tried leave my chops rubbery, but not this one.  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle a little Mrs. Dash across the top for extra flavor, and broiled the chops for a few seconds to really give them a brown color.  Overall, an excellent and simple recipe that I will use from now on.

I was looking for a simple recipe for lamb and decided to try this recipe. It was easy to put together. I had plain bread crumbs and added 1/4 tsp of cumin 1,garlic powder, onion powder, and salt and pepper to 1 cup of bread crumbs . I had 4 lamb chops. My family thought it was a tasty change from how I usually prepare them

I followed the recipe to the letter but the cooking time at 375F was way off for me.  The chops were done within the first 20 minutes.  Internal tempeture was 140 F.  The recipe called for them to be turned over after 20 minutes and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  Did I miss something?

I had lamb when I visited London and hope this would bring me back to that rich, beautiful flavor but it didn't quite do it for me. I would be willing to try this again trying a few modifications from other members. My breadcrumbs didn't get very crispy but it could have been the baking dish I used. Maybe next time I would try a regular sheet pan. The lamb itself wasn't too bad, juicy and tender but the gooey crumbs kinda ruined it for me. Also seemed a bit bland and I even used flavored breadcrumbs. Thanks for the recipe, though! I'm sure it works better for others than it did for me.

This recipe is now a staple in our house, not just for lamb but also for pork chops. My husband and son love them! I do 1 1/2 teaspoons of Worcestershire and 1 1/2 teaspoons of soy sauce and marinate for a 1/2 hour in the fridge. I add a little fresh grated Parmesan to the breading and a few minutes before I pull it out of the oven I grate a little Parmesan on top. I love this recipe!!!

I was a little nervous because I've prepared lamb before, but this recipe is very simple.  I, too, added honey and drizzled them with it when I flipped them, my boyfriend really appreciated the extra sweetness.  I shortened up the cooking time by only a few minutes to make sure they weren't over done and they were perfect!

I was a little worried to actually cook lamb at home. Followed the suggestion to add a little honey and used Japanese bread crumbs for extra crunch.  Also added a bit of fresh rosemary.  Looked very impressive to my guests.

Wonderful!  Hubby and kids loved them too.  I had neither bread crumbs nor croutons so I used crushed garlic pita chips.  It made for a nice crunchy crust.  Thanks for a great recipe

Quite plain but good for every second week use. My 18th month old daughter loved it - maybe because it was really tender. A good way to use left-over bbq chops!

My husband and I love lamb chops, and I usually go for "the simpler the better."  However, for a change I tried this recipe, and I was very pleased.  As suggested I broiled for a minute or two to crisp up the breadcrumbs.  Easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Well, I had to ask my boyfriend what he thought of these as I'm not a meat-eater...His review was a big grin, a nod and "Very good, very tender." He gave it a four because it wasn't crispy like he likes it...but he definitely gave me a five star review with the first bite. Will make often...and try broiling for the last few minutes for crispiness next time. Thanks Leslie!

Weren't sure what to do with chops, tried this and added some Lawry's to the marinade, let it sit on counter for 45 minutes. Added just a sprinkle of parmesan to italian crumbs, dredged, cooked 20 mins each side and it was fabulous.

I made this recipe today, and it was definitely a HIT! I kept the basic ingredients and added a few of my own. I seasoned the chops with a chop seasoning, some garlic powder, parsley flakes, salt and pepper. Also added a little tenderizer. I used the egg and worcestershire sauce, and instead of regular bread crumbs, I used seasoned panko.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

I always try the original recipe first and it was good, but next time I will spice up the bread crumbs and maybe even try the honey.

I read all the reviews and followed the recipe exactly. I usually grill lamb chops.  My husband did not like the crust on the lamb and had a hard time separating fat from the meat because it was hidden by the crust.  He says, "stick to grilling lamb chops.  I have to agree.

Update 8/30/10

I still use this every time I make lamb chops.  I've switched to panko breadcrumbs and it's given the chops the crunch I like.

    This recipe is FABULOUS!  I had never eaten lamb before and was looking for something simple.  I used this recipe and I can tell you, I am a convert.  I've now made this twice in two weeks and am going to a local rancher to get more chops!  This is the only recipe I am going to use.

Thank you for this delicious recipe. I used the round chops and they were very delicious and tender. I didn't have bread crunbs so I used my rolling pin and rolled our garlic flavored crutons, and as someone else used honey, I did tool. Thanks again, will make again.

These were not very good at all with the lamb.  It probably would be better with pork chops.  The bread crumb mixture was not crunchy at all and I even broiled the lamb after.  Sorry:(

My first time making lamb chops...I liked it, my husband loved it! It was quick and easy--I already had all of the ingredients in the fridge.  I used italian bread crumbs and crushed garlic and cheese croutons for more flavor and crispiness and added pressed garlic to the chops after dipping in sauce.  I'll definately use this recipe again.

Absolutely love the prep time - approximately 7 minutes.  Chops turned out tender, juicy, and tasty.  My fiance grabed one right off the pan, and then asked for seconds.  
The only thing - not salty enough for me (My fiance, however, thought it was just right).  Consider adding some salt into egg/sauce mixture.  Otherwise, if you serve it with salty side dish, should be just right!  Enjoy!

A good basic recipe but the meat got to well done for medium or medium rare. Would suggest 17 - 18 minutes a side. Also added lemon juice and mustard to give it flavor with my own dry rub.

This is it !  I've been trying different ways to cook some lamb shoulder chops that went on sale recently. As others have suggested, I used Italian bread crumbs + some grated Parmesan cheese & rosemary in the breading. Also added some honey to the Worcestershire-egg wash. My chops were kind of thin, so only cooked 15 minutes each side, they came out perfect.

We didn't like this recipe at all. It did not turn out crispy, even though I turned up the heat. The chops were like pablum on the outside.

Tasty fast way to make chops and something different from just broiling or grilling.

I used the half soy/half Worcestershire sauce method.  Was going to add honey but I forgot.  =/  I do see how that would have been a nice touch.  I cooked them for about half an hour, as the boyfriend and I like our meat rare.  It was very good.  This was my first time making lamb.  My boyfriend said it was a little oily, but lamb always is, no?

The first time I tried it even with the 1/2 worcestire and 1/2 soy but I didn't love it.  This time I did that but also marinated it for 1/2 hour before cooking and only cooked for 35 minutes.  This came out MUCH better!  My very picky husband loved it and my toddler twins kept asking for more!  As my one son said, "Mmmm!  Yummy dinner!"

Great recipe.  I used pork chops instead of lamb chops and marinated them in egg mixture for about an hour.  They came out really tender and flavourful

I didnt have breadcrumbs on hand so I used crushed up maple flavoured shredded wheat cereal. (Weird I know) But it turned out delicious! This is the only way I make lamb now :)

I used the suggestion of seasoned bread crumbs and using half soy/half worcestshire sauces. This was fabulous! Tender, tender, tender, and flavorful! Will marinate the chops in the sauce for a bit the next time I make them. This will be a regular at our house!

My son had never eaten Lamb Chops and brought some home for me to cook.  Neither one of us realized that most recipes called for marinating lamb chops.  This recipe was one of the few that didn't take a lot of time (we decided to have them on a Saturday evening at 7:oopm)  We tried it along with mashed potatoes (the REAL thing :) & peas with mushrooms & pearl onions (canned.  We used Italian breadcrumbs because we had no plain, it added extra flavor that marinating probably would have!

Very Good!

it was a perfect recipe but I did made some changes first of all I bought the whole rack of lamb which was like 8 lambchops in them and then marinated the whole rack in the marinate for 40 min,,  I added some honey, salt, b.pepper,hot sauce a tiny amount of redpepper flakes..and ofcourse garlic and just one egg along with wro..sauce.
then I cut them and after dipping in the marinate and lightly dredge them in seasoned breadcrumbs bake them for an hr thurning them once after half an hr. and woala..perfect the best chops U will ever have even better then the ones I ate in retaurant.

This was very easy to make, and wasn't bad, but I gave it 3 stars because it was just "good," not spectacular.  A very solid, decent meal, but not really special.

This is a great recipe! It is quick and easy and the lamb chops are tender and moist.  I didn't have any rosemary and I think it would have added just the right touch.

I liked this recipe because it wasn't one for which you have to stand over it all the time. I prepped the chops (less than ten minutes, really)and other than flipping once, had no further work to do. Nothing spectacular about the taste of the chops, just good lamb.

While this recipe was very easy to make, I think that it would be better suited to pork chops than lamb chops.  It overwhemled the flavor of the lamb and made them tasted like pork

I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the regular.  The cooking times made the chops well done, I like mine medium rare.  The coating turned out very hard and had to remove it to eat the chops. I will try it again using the regular breadcrumbs.

Did the recipe exactly as written and it was simple and very tasty. Next time I'll shorten the cooking time by 10 min due to the thickness of my chops, but other than that very good!

This recipe is great. I kinda combined all the additions from the other reviews. I bake the chops 15-17 min each side and I did drizzle some honey. The chops were tender and superb. I will try it with pork chop as well. I marinate the chops for couple of hours.

This was another VERY simple recipe to use. It says that it will make 6 servings. I'm only cooking for myself so I divided the recipe by 3 using only 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. I sprayed them with a little bit of cooking oil and baked them in my counter-top convection oven. They turned out very well!! I will be making this again.

This was so easy to do. I used Panaku breadcrumbs and added a rather thick layer which turned into a fabulous crispy crust, paired with the juicy tender lamb was a wonderful contrast. I served mine with a side of mint sauce. Will make again without a doubt.

I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce and added a fresh squeeze of lemon juice and a dash of sea salt - the lamb chops turned out delicious!  can't wait to try it again with worcestershire!

Recipe was ok but not sure on the temp because my lamb chops were very chewy. I would probably put in lower setting next time to cook slower.

Yummy!  I like my meat on the rare side, so I cut the cooking time down.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and drizzled with honey like others suggested.  Fantastic - I will definitely make these again!

I don't understand the rave reviews.  These chops did not crisp.  I upped the temperature and shortened the cooking time as one reviewer suggested, but they were not crisp - simply overcooked.  I will not make this again.

We tired to lamb chops until I read this recipe.  The only change I made was adding a couple of teaspoons of honey to the egg mixture, after reading kdevitt's review.  Excellent!

This was an easy recipe for weeknights. I put one sachet of tomato cup a soup and some herbs and garlic salt in the crumbs - yummy!!. I also baked this in a very hot oven on a flat tray and they came out nice and crunchy, not soggy at all. I will definately make this one again. It was a hit with the family!

Most people expect their lambchops to be broiled, so this is a nice surprise.  Easier than broiling too!  Very tasty!

My Husband is the only one in the house who eats lamb so he usually makes it himself. This was extremely easy to make so I guess I can make it for him again. He enjoyed it very much. Thank you.

This was alright but not crispy, and the meat was very fatty with the topping mushy.  Good flavor, bad mouthfeel.

These were wonderful.  I am just learning how to cook with lamb and we really enjoyed this.  I was short on time so fried them instead of baking.  Will try this with pork chops also.  Thanks Leslie!

My husband and I love this recipe. It has a great flavor. It is very easy to make, and impressive to serve company. I use crushed seasoned croutons rather than bread crumbs - they are crispy and tasty!!

This was a good, easy way to prepare lamb. Nothing special though. I used seasoned breadcrumbs and followed the recipe exactly. Will probably make again b/c it is so easy.

I used this recipe for pork chops instead of lamb and it was super!  For the bread crumbs, I chose wheat crackers and it was delicious.  Very good with "Green Beans with Blue Cheese" by Kate.

This is a terrific recipe, perfect for dinner after a long day of work.  I added a bit more worchestershire sauce as my husband loves it, and it was delicious.  No kid-friendly rating included as, well, there aren't any in our house yet!

I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and added rosemary sprigs to a couple of the chops.

The meat came out moist and tender with a delicate flavor from the  seasoning.

Very good.  The crumbs definitely needed seasoning so I added S & P and also a little vegetable oil; mixed it thoroughly so they crumbs would stick better to the chops.  Result was a crispy coating, tender and juicy meat.  I was a little leery of  the Worcestershire sauce but followed the recipe...it was quite good.  Made this an all-in-one-pan meal by baking carrots and potatoes in the same pan.

This was a great way to trick my family into eating lamb. The only alteration I made was the addition of rosemary, thyme, garlic and black pepper to the breadcrumbs, to give it that traditional lamb flavor profile. I highly recommend it for people trying lamb for the first time.

There was only the 2 of us, so I only used 4 chops!  I cut the recipe in half and added some parmesan cheese, garlic powder salt and pepper and about 5 good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce..  The chops turned out really good, but I found them over cooked, so next time I would cut the timing down to 15 minutes ...turn chops over then cook for another 15

Delicious!! I used corn meal instead of bread crumbs, and added some different seasonings (per other reviews advice).  I'm not a big lamb fan, and I loved it.

THE BEST!!!! This is now in the rotation and has taken over the place of our pork chops.
I listened to the reviews and added honey and let it marinate for 30m.  I added parm chz. to the seasoned bradcrumbs along with parsley and garlic powder.  I drizzled honey on the chops after I turned them.  40 mins was spot on.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This recipe is outstanding!  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, while retaining their moisture.  The egg mixture added just enough flavor without overpowering the delicious taste of the lamb.  Like other reviewers, I marinated the chops in the egg mixture for 30 minutes.

It was very bland, had no taste whatsoever, and it was mushy instead of crispy. It could have called for mint jelly in the recipe because it tasted too gamy. I will not make this recipe again.

I didn't care for this at all, but it may be that I don't care for lamb, not this recipe in particular.  I won't make this again.
