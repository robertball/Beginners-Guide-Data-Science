Pretty good.   But I would cut the salt in half.  It was a bit salty.

The meat was so tender and the flavor was so good. Unfortunately it's was too salty. I'd make it again and cut the salt in half.

Sorry to say this was disappointing.  I found the recipe in allrecipes magazine & bought expensive sirloin from a good store before I noticed the lack of reviews.  Still I followed the recipe to the letter - well per the magazine recommendations.  (whole bay leaves, reduce salt, buy sirloin tip, and use metal skewers) While the flavor was good, the seasoning remained very mild & the meat was not tender.  My husband and I ate a few pieces each, put the leftovers in the 'fridg.

You must cook this with coarse sea salt to make this as intended.  I’m assuming those who complained about the saltiness failed to do so (FYI- you should always use the thickest sea salt available when grilling. The real thick stuff can be difficult to find sometimes in the US - I always bring sea salt back when traveling to brazil)

Excellent,  you must use sea salt coarse instead of fine salt. makes a huge difference. Tastes like it did in Portugal this past summer. I have made it three times.

Salt should only be added before grilling and use Madeira fortified wine instead of red wine.

I followed the recipe according to the adjustments suggested in allrecipes magazine. We were unable to eat it. It was very salty (even with the reduced amount of salt as suggested.) Also, I used a dry red cooking wine, but we didn't care for the flavor.

Great summer recipe.  Make sure to reduce the salt (I did 1 TBSP).

This is a good recipe. I have eaten Espetadas my whole life. The secret is in the length of time the meat is marinated for. The longer the better. Also, use rock salt and/or Kosher salt.

Very good. I marinated overnight and the beef turned out very flavorful and extremely tender.
