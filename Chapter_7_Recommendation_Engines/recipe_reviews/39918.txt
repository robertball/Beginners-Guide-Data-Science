I just came back to get this recipe because I lost it and I use it every Christmas to make our "Perfect Men" cookies: gingerbread men made of chocolate shortbread.  We love this recipe, but we change it just a little.  We use 1/2 cup extra cocoa and 1/2 cup less of flour.  This way, the dough is the same consistency, but flavor is much more chocolatey.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Substituted 1/2 c more cocoa for 1/2 c flour, added pinch of baking soda. Melted the butter, mixed the wet ingredients, sifted the dry ingredients together, added the dry to the wet. Chilled it for about 30 minutes. Rolled 1/4 inch thick. 1 1/2 inch heart cookies took 6 minutes, 3 inch heart cookies took 8 minutes. These are sturdy enough to use in cookie bouquets. I did not add chocolate, but piped icing. Excellent flavor. They are better after several hours rather than straight out of the oven.

Very good cookies!  I softened the butter instead of cutting it in- much less work and they turned out wonderful.  I took SugarPlum's advice and increased the cocoa (by 1/4 cup) and decreased the flour by the same amount.  I'm glad I did- the chocolate flavor is perfect for me.  Used organic cocoa and one cup whole wheat pastry flour.  Dough was a tiny bit sticky so I stuck it in the fridge for 20 minutes and rolled it out between wax paper.  Cut into heart shapes and frosted with pink frosting (Decorator Frosting from this site) for Valentine's Day.  I found between 7.5 -8 minutes to be the pefect baking time, depending on how thick the cookies were.  My babies helped me make these and LOVED it!

soooooooooooooo good! But...,my inexperienced friend( it was her first time making cookies) thought it was too dry and added milk...so it wasn't really a shortbread cookie in the end, but it tasted great! It was a bit gooey and ever so chocolately!!! The chocolate chips didn't really melt very well, and we accidentally burnt a little bit. It was more of a paste instead of something that you could dip in, so we kind of spread it on like butter. It tasted really good though and it's quite easy to make. (believe me, we succeeded and we are real cooking beginners. We can mess up even the simplest recipe...but, man they tasted good!) Even my mom who is really health conscious and looks down on fattening treats loved these and actually complpimented us (which is rare)

Soopooh and friends ^_^

After all the mixed reviews i decided to still give these a shot. They were great, not too sweet, but I liked that. The dough was so easy to work with and my cookies were sturdy. People who complained need a little lesson in cookie making i think. A shortbread cookie should never be rolled too thin. And I always roll cookies between 2 pieces of parchment paper, then i chilled the flattened dough and cut the cookies and bake. And you really can't over bake them. As soon as the tops were no longer glistening I took them out of the oven.  then i drizzled some melted chocolate over the tops. Beauty!

I loved these cookies. I did have to chill the dough for a little while before I rolled it out. I cut the recipe in half and was able to get 2 1/2 dozen cookies. Instead of dipping them in chocolate, i used the sugar cookie frosting recipe and added cocoa to it. I heated it up before spreading it onto the cookies and it was beautiful. These are so chocolaty, they taste great with a sweet frosting.

The cookie is okay but not at all "extra chocolaty".  The texture is good.  I own a cookie business and was trying out a few chocolate shortbread recipes.  The search continues!

I made these and brought them to the office--they were a big hit.  

Also, I used regular cocoa with a bit of baking powder as the recipe suggests, and they turned out fine!

These turned out perfectly. We made them exactly as shown in the picture, cut into hearts and sandwiched with pink tinted frosting.I did find the dough needed a fair bit of dusting with flour to prevent sticking. About half way through I switched to cocoa for dusting to avoid too much white in the dough. Loved them!!

This recipe made gorgeous cookies for our First Communion reception!  I formed the cookies using a chalice cookie cutter, then dipped the bottoms in Ghirardelli mint chocolate and "frosted" the tops with a raspberry glaze. Passing this recipe along has been a request gladly fulfilled!

I softened the butter slightly, cut into squares and added to flour/cocoa/sugar mixture. I mixed on low speed until the butter was "pea size." I lined the cookies sheets with parchment paper and lightly sprayed with Bakers Joy. I cut the cookies into shapes, lightly coating (using a pastry brush) with a mixture of one egg white and one tablespoon water. This created a lovely sheen and helped the sparkling sugar to adhere. I baked for 8 minutes, cooled for four on the cookie sheet, and moved to a cooling rack. I drizzled with melted semi-sweet chocolate. These cookies are the perfect chocolate treat without being too sweet. Enjoy!

Really tasty! Not overwhelmingly chocolatey, but a nice chocolate flavour and perfect texture. I did cutouts of stars and drizzled them in white chocolate, yummm! And because I can't follow directions well, I used regular cocoa with no added baking powder and they turned out fine.

It was so strange making these, but they're delicious!  I ended up having to knead the dough with my hands before it'd come together, but that just made it more fun to do.

Great cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly except swapping 1/2 cup flour for cocoa becasue I love chocolate!.  I chilled the dough overnight and rolled them out the next day.  They rolled out wonderful.  They made great Christmas cookies, used "Sugar Cookie Icing" from this site which also was wonderful.  Allrecipes and the member reviews NEVER let me down.

Good cookies.  I did as others suggested and used extra cocoa and less flour.  Cookies turned out great - I used a combination of flour and cocoa to dust them with when I rolled them out.  I used fudge icing and they tasted almost like brownies.

This is incredible!!  We followed the suggestion to increase the cocoa by a 1/2 cup and reduce the flour by a half a cup.  Perfection.  We rolled out the dough and placed the whole thing on a cookie sheet.  After it was baked, we then used cookie cutters.

Turned out absolutely perfect! After following the recipe, I added about a 1/2 cup of Chocolate Mint Baileys and then enough flower to restore the cookie dough's consistency. They taste delicious. :)

This turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly for the cookies except for refrigerating the dough and rolling them as thin as possible before cutting them.  I added more mint to the filling and they were a hit.  A surprisingly mild chocolatey-mint flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are terribly dry. I took them to a party and they got referred to as doggie cookies. They tasted a little better dipped in chocolate. Would not recommend this cookie!

Absolutely fantastic and to make them double chocolatey I dipped in melted choc chips/Almond Bark.  I made them look like biscoti dipped in chocolate.  And they freeze great.

As suggested by others, I increased the cocoa and decreased the flour accordingly. This was a tasty recipe with an easy to work with dough. It is too fragile to work with detailed or large (over 2") cutters though. :(

A great all purpose cookie. I placed them in the kitchen at work when I got in at 8:30 and they were all gone by lunch time. I will use this easy recipe for all holidays and occasions. Thanks Emily, where ever you are!

These were pretty good, not as sweet as I'd expected. I took other reviewers advice and upped the cocoa powder -- maybe next time I'll not and see if they're any sweeter. I like my chocolate goods not as sweet (hence the 4 stars), but I married a sugar addict.

Wonderful receipe, made the cookies for my son's 2nd birthday, all the mums loved it and asked me for this recipe. Just watch out that you don't bake the cookies too long or they will dry out.  For me 8 minutes was enough - as soon as the top looked a bit dry I took them out.  They were still a bit soft but hardened well when they cooled off.

These cookies are SO good!  Just a little drizzle of chocolate on the top makes them perfect; just let right sweetness.  The kids loved them, too!  Everyone who sampled them loved them.

They are very tasty.  I found it easier to roll out the dough with wax paper on top as my roller kept sticking to the dough and it wouldn't roll out smoothly.  Also, I found the cookies to be too soft for dipping into the melted chocolate.  the cookies would break.  So I painted the melted chocolate on with a silicone brush.

Really good.  Not too dry.  I added a little extra chocolate.  I was impatient and in a hurry and melted the butter in the microwave (didn't allow it to soften to room temperature) and the dough came out way too soft to use cookie cutters, so I just spread it in springform pans and baked it that way.  Probably could have chilled the dough to firm it up so cookie cutters would work, but like I said, I was impatient :)

I used other revierwers’ suggestions and added 1/2  cup extra cocoa and 1/2 cup less flour. I also added orange zest to give it a little extra flavor. Turned out great! Easy dough to work with and delicious to eat.

Great recipe, but kind of a pain in the butt to make!  To make it easier on yourself, cut in the cold butter using a food processor, then beat the eggs & vanilla together before adding.  The final mix is easier to do with your hands than with a spoon, but it's messy and sticky.  The cookies are delicious; great texture, just chocolatey enough, and the whole kitchen smells like brownies.  Thanks!

It didn't resemble a shortbread in taste at all.  It was a cookie so my kids ate it, but I wasn't impressed.  It wasn't buttery, crispy of chocolaty enough for the name.

Perfect! These cookies were exactly what I was looking for. I followed others suggestions of adding extra cocoa and I added some chocolate chips (about 1/2 a bag) at the end. After I added the eggs and vanilla I ended up having to mix the dough by hand. It was very stiff, but perfect for rolling and cutting. They are crunchy and delicious.

I followed one reviewer and substituted an extra 1/2c of cocoa for the 1/2c of flour. Lovely dense texture. The melted chocolate chip topping   makes the cookie. Really good.

I just love this recipe! I've been using for it all the wedding favors I make. I also make a version on a skewer stick, by inserting a wet skewer stick just before baking. My version of the recipe is, I add 1 cup of cocoa and 1 cup of cornflour but less cake flour.

Just used this as the "crust" for a chocolate mousse tart-I did decrease the flour and substitute cocoa according to other rater's proportions.  1/2 of the recipe worked great for a standard tart pan and I just pressed it in.  After cooling, I spread hot fudge (not warmed, but straight out of the jar) and then I topped with "chocolate mousse" (1 sm. pkg choc inst. choc pudding mixed with 1 cup milk and folded into 1 pint of whipping cream that was whipped).  Plan to serve with raspberry sauce-can't wait!  curious to see how the cookie crust will slice-but am sure it will be yummy.

I was making chocolate cut out cookies for a xmas sale and tried this recipe. I followed other reviewers and substituted 1/4C flour with cocoa powder. I found the cookies not sweet at all, and rather more on the bitter side. The cookies were also very crumbly. That did not help as I had to decorate the cookies. Every little movement crumbled a few cookies and it was really frustrating to me.  In the end, I tweaked the recipe by using the original amount of flour, reduced the cocoa powder by 10-15g, added a pinch of baking soda, substituted icing sugar with fine sugar and increased the amount of sugar quantity. That made the cookies more manageable and easier to handle. I made about 22 to 24 pieces of 4-inch cookies per recipe.

Delicious chocolatey cookie!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and increased the cocoa for my double batch by 1/2 C and decreased the flour by the same.  These turned out wonderfully, and it's too bad I'm selling them, because my kids can't keep their hands off of them!

Love this recipe.  A bit of salt on top of the cookie, without chocolate on top, really brings out the chocolaty flavor.

This is a great recipe. I followed some of the raters advice and added more cocoa and baked for 7 minutes and wow!I melted and swirled some dark and white chocolate over the cut out cookies.My testers said the cookies tasted more like brownies and not so much like shortbread.The cookies did not last very long...Delicious.

this is a great chocolate shortbread cookie recipe.  The taste is very chocolatey and is exactly what a shortbread cookie should taste like.  If you are looking for real shortbread cookie recipe- this is a good one to try.  Keeping in mind that shortbread cookies are not supposed to be chewy or intense in flavor.  This cookie turns out firm, yet soft and has a great chocolate taste without being overly sweet.  One thing to try is melting white chocolate chips to drizzle over the cookies- It makes them look very pretty.  And don't overcook them- 7-8mins. is ideal depending on how big a cut out you use, they will continue cooking on the cookie sheet as they cool.
thank you for a great recipe.

Good chocolate shortbread!  I tried them as sandwiches, with the chocolate drizzle and with a bit of icing on top and everyone prefers something different!

I also substituted in the 1/4 cup cocoa for same amount of flour and that did the trick.

5 stars with regards of ease for preparation.  3 stars for chocolately flavor.  Good recipe for mother's of toddlers.  I rolled the dough into balls and made thumbprints and put chocolate chips in thumbprints.  When cookies came out of the oven, I spread out the melted chocolate, doesn't look as pretty as drizling chocolate, but is a time saver.

Smelled lovely, and cookies baked up crisp. Maybe I rolled it out too thin? The dough was quite easy to work with / roll out though.
