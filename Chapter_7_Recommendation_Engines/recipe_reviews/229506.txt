This is really good, and fairly simple to make.  I used a good vegetable bullion, as the author recommended, and omitted the salt.   Couldn't find the correct pasta, so used salad macaroni which worked fine.  One note:  10 minutes at medium high heat was much too much for the onion and garlic (the mixture started to brown after 5 minutes at medium, at which point I proceeded with the rest of the recipe).  Healthy and very tasty!

So good!!! I only had 3 cups chicken stock, so I used that plus 3 cups water. Soup came out perfect, chunky and delicious! My husband said itâ€™s his new favorite and my 5 year old inhaled it!!! Serve with crusty bread.

Very good, fresh-tasting take on minestrone. I used white kidney beans and vegetable bullion in water since that's what I had on hand. The fresh herbs brought a lot of flavor to the simple broth I used.

This was a really nice change from the ordinary tomato based minestrone. I made as written except that I waited until the last five minutes to drop my zucchini in because I like it crisp. The next time I make this I will wait to put the peas and green beans in then too but that is just a personal preference. I find this works better for me when the leftovers are reheated as well. All the veggies hold their bright green color that way. This one is a keeper!
