First -- I quite often wonder why people post a review of a recipe, when they didn't follow the exact directions in the first place!!  e.g. “I made this recipe, but substituted the onion salt and hot sauce with ketchup…..... my husband didn't like it... 2 stars.”.  

That is my biggest complaint with the reviews that exist… those people are only reviewing their own versions, not the recipe someone posted, but I digress.

This is a good jerky recipe. I followed it to the ‘T’, and therefore can review it.  

I didn't give it 5 stars, because I felt it could have eased up on the Worcestershire sauce a bit.  I found that flavor overpowering, for the same reason I would never put a steak sauce on a good steak in a decent restaurant:  let the flavors stand on their own.

So less Worcestershire, and bump up the traditional jerky salt and pepper aspects, and you will likely have a winner.

Good recipe, worked well in my electric oven... I turned the heat up to 170 and cracked the oven door to exhaust the moisture.  I tried it a second time substituting teryaki (sp) instead of soy and added some liquid smoke and chili powder... Liked it better this way, not as salty.  Watch your time, don't over cook.  Should bend not snap.  Good stuff!

I followed the recipe to a "T" for my 1st batch and it was good. I used venison and after sliceing the meat I rinsed it in tap water to get out as much blood as possible. For my tastes I feel I made some improvements on the following batches. I cut the pinches of salt out and the worcestershire to 3/4 cup and the soy to 3/4 cup and the red pepper to 3/4 t and then I added 2T brown suger, 2T honey, and 1/4 mesquite liquid smoke. I like my version best!

Well T Bird my husband is a happy man!!  He's addicted to Jack Links (store bought) jerky, but complains about how expensive it is.  This jerky is VERY TASTY, not as good as Jack Links, but much more tender!  I added a tsp. of McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning, and used coarse ground pepper, it added such a nice little kick!  I saved the metal skewers from store bought shish kabobs & they work great.  The guys at our super bowl party ALL loved this, THANKS!

Great Flavor!  I used low salt soy sauce and it was enough salt for me.  Yum.
My comments: 
I cut a top round roast lengthwise into two thick pieces.  Avoid/remove the fatty or gristly areas (use for soup or stock). Lightly freeze the slabs.  Cut  along the grain to get the traditional texture - across the grain doesn't work well.  
Marinate two days for extra flavor saturation. A few times a day, massage and turn the bag to redistribute the marinade evenly.  
Line the bottom of your oven with foil to catch drips.  I don't turn the oven on until I have it all loaded so it's not hot to work with.  I also wipe down the door which gets VERY messy before heating.
Separate the thin cuts from the thick cuts.  Squeegee the marinade off with your fingers to remove excess.  String tips of like sizes onto wooden kebab skewers.  (I get 10 pieces easily on a skewer.)  Then lace them through your oven rack so they all hang down.  Alternate sides of the rack so you have them evenly distributed.  Place the thinner cuts towerd the front so you can easily remove them when dried.  Place a hot pad in the door to hold it slightly open to let the moisture escape.

The cooking method worked very well! If anyone tries to make this beef jerkey, watch the heat and time as they vary from oven to oven.  I cut down my baking time to 3.5 hours instead, and it was well done.  Another suggestion is that do select meat with least fat as possible, and you will reduce tremendous amount of grease dripping while the jerky's being cooked (and your oven won't smell like it's burning too!).

I'm totally satisfied! I followed all ingredients to a tee, but added a little celery salt and 1 tsp of brown sugar & cayenne 'cuz we're a bunch of daredevils. YEAH! ~that was my husband's sentiments. He, my 2 yr old and myself ate the whole batch last night. I used eye of round steak that had been marked down to practically $0! Also, slicing (across grain) is super easy if the steak is a little frozen. I got it paper thin with no trouble. I'm making more after a store run!

I cooked this two ways.  After the first 24 hours of marinading, I dried half of the meat in the dehydrator and put the remaining meat back into the fridge.  The 2nd night, I cooked the rest of the meat in the oven as directed, which was much better...I'm not sure if that was due to cooking method or marinade time.  However, my boyfriend and daughter thought this was too spicy while my roommate and I thought it was great.  Will make again.

My first time making beef jerky.  I followed the recipe quite closely, only leaving out the Italian seasoning and upping the hot sauce.  I didn't hang them, I put them on a rack over a sheet pan, and used balls of tin foil to make the rack tilt on an angle to let the juices run off.  I did four hours at 170 (lowest my oven goes, for some reason) and they were nowhere near done...did a further 2 1/2 hours at 190.  The texture is a bit off...any bits of fat (I did trim, but there's always a bit) are oddly chewy, and the rest varies from crunchy to tough.  I think that the marinade requires an acid such as red-wine vinegar or lemon juice to give it a better texture and tang.  It isn't bad...but it's not great.  If I try again, I'll use more hot sauce and some vinegar...It's a good thing I started early in the morning, or I wouldn't be making the (baked) dinner I had planned.  Thanks for sharing.  EDIT:  After letting them cool, they were MUCH dryer than when I took them out of the oven.  I think that the recipe should specify that they might not seem quite done when the time is up, but that taking them out and letting them cool will dry them out further.  I suppose if I had been experienced with this sort of recipe I would know that, but I didn't).  They are a little too dry now, a combination of my own mistake and unclear directions.  Again, thanks anyway.  :)

The best I have tasted.  Everyone at work waits anxiously until I make another batch.  I've tried other recipes but this one has them beat by far.  Thanks for sharing.  For true spice lovers 1/2 teas. of Dave's Insanity hot sauce does the trick.

Hey mysteryman, it messes with real ratings when you fool around with the given recipe and add stuff that obviously will not work. Please don't do that.

Excellent flavor, I subbed Italian seasoning for the dressing mix and added hickory liquid smoke.

I've tried this recipe several times over the last couple of months and it's perfect. I personally don't add the entire teaspoon of hot sauce, barely a half tsp I would guess. For some strange reason it always comes out slightly different, but always good! It barely lasts a few days around here. Just a little sidenote: I dump my marinated meat into a colander and then lay it out on sheets of paper towels before putting it in the oven. This speeds up the drying time without altering the flavor. I didn't do this with my first batch and it molded after the second day (not that there was much left)so I've since done the pre-dry drying and it works a charm. I've even used cheaper clearance meat and made this jerky for my dogs with less salt and no hot sauce.

I tried 3 different jerky recipes and this is the one. I make a lot of jerky now because every time I make a batch, it disappears within a day or two. My friends rant and rave about my jerky now and its all thanks to this recipe! I followed it exactly with the exception that I added a little bit of liquid smoke. Unfortunately it came out too salty for my taste (it was still delicious but just too salty). To change that I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1 1/2 cups. Tastes absolutely perfect! If you want a decent recipe without strange weird ingredients that tastes awesome this is the one.

So glad I found this recipe!! My husband is in Afghanistan and has been begging for beef jerky to be sent to him. He cannot have MSG, so I knew I was going to have to learn to make beef jerky if I wanted to be cost effective in sending him large quantities! He absolutely LOVES this stuff! (and so do all the other guys in his truck!) Thank you for posting!

I really liked this recipe.  What's more is my wife, who doesn't like beef jerky, keeps SNEAKING MY JERKY!!!  On the spur of the moment I rewarded one of my dogs for a particularly good behavior with a little lick of the fingers after I'd finished a piece, and now he hangs around me waiting to see if there's gonna be anymore.  He never used to beg like this.

So in short, this jerky is so good it ruined my wife and dog.  :o)

SOOOOO YUMMY.   this one is a keeper.  we made the recipe as directed and liked it just fine.  we 1/2 the recipe due to the amount of steak i had on hand.  now i wished we would have made the full batch.  make it worth while if you already have the oven on and it takes a while to bake.  our next batch we are going to add less wozzy, more soy, more hot sauce, and more pepper! we baked it in the oven cuz we don't have a dehydrator and it worked great.  170 deg for about 4 hrs.  we draped the meat directly on the oven rack and put a big piece of foil underneath to catch all the drippings.  it worked great.  at our local wal mart in the meat dept is a super thin cut steak called maleysia (sp?)  it also says on the pkg its round steak. fairly cheap and it is the perfect thickness and super easy to mix up your merinade put in ziploc and move to coat.  having that steak saved me tons of time.  thanks for sharing.

I only gave it 3 stars. I substituted yogurt and non-fat mayonaise for the other ingredients and cooked it at 550 for 2 hrs becuase I was hungry. Tasted horrible and was overdone. I think I'll stick with slim-jims. [just kidding] ha ha!

WE LOVED THIS! I made exactly as written. I used a slicer to slice the meat thin. I used partially frozen meat to slice it easier. I will be making this again. Next time I think Im going to add some liquid smoke like others suggested. Not that it needs it at all but just to try it. Thanks Dewy!

Probably one of the best jerky marinades I've ever had or tried.  Easy to adjust the heat level, too for those that want to.  Thanks!

I've been making this for a few years now.  The first time I followed it to a T.  I love worchestershire sauce, but it was overpowering in this recipe.  I've since cut it back to 2/3 c. and use 1 1/4 c. Light Soy sauce.  I follow everything else as written.  Thanks Dewy.

Made the recipe just as stated, and should have doubled it cause they vanished instantly!!! The next batch will have a little more cayenne pepper to suit my taste, but the jerky is great just as the recipe calls for.

I followed the recipe and marinaded London Broil for approximately 24 hours and then followed the directions. Someone mentioned metal skewers and hanging them in the oven. It worked beautifully! I took the Jerky out after 3.5 hours and it was perfect, the only problem is I only used about 2 1/2 pounds of meat and it is not enough!

This is our go to jerkey recipe.  The only thing I change is to add red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit and we cook it in a dehydrator.

Quite tasty!  I know we'll be making this one again.  Didn't change anything with the recipe.  Next time I might add some liquid smoke and see how that turns out though.

Everyone loved the flavor!  I used the recipe for Italian salad dressing mix from this site.  I used a dehyrator about 4 hours.

This recipe was excellent! I will admit that I did modify the second batch a bit (I skipped the hot pepper sauce and added a little extra garlic powder), but that was just to suit my personal tastes a little better. My husband loves spicy things, so the first batch was right up his alley!

I've made this at least a two dozen times over the past few years... I always follow the recipe to a "T" and have always enjoyed it. I'm married to a cattle rancher and we've always got beef on hand.  I would suggest though that if you enjoy spicy jerky to add more hot pepper sause and black pepper as this is not spicy jerky.   It is a great and easy recipe.  Thanks

i have to say this jerky is awesome!!!! i followed directions exactly. i wasnt sure what kind of hot sauce to use, so for future reference to anyone who is afraid of heat or is wanting heat, i used some crazy a** kicking hot sauce that my hubby doesnt even like to use on foods cause it is just too hot. i put in 1 tsp as directed and it turned out perfect for me. not too spicy, just a hint of heat. i may add a couple tsp. the next time now that i know it isnt an insane amount of heat. i think if i had used something like tobasco i would have been more disappointed. also i did add a couple dashes of smoke flavoring, not too much tho. i cooked it in my food dehydrator and it is perfect. i will definitely use this recipe again!!!!!!!

Thank you so much for the idea how to make jerky without a dehydrator! I did not use the marinade suggested, already had an easy one that we love. I use one bottle Sunbird teriyaki marinade and 1/2 bottle sunbird teriyaki/honey glaze, and 2 capfuls of liquid smoke, and black pepper! Very good. Also, the butcher suggested I use Carne Asada, wich is already sliced as thin as possible! It worked wonderful and all I had to do was trim off the fat! My stove only goes as low as 200 degrees, so I had it set between warm and 200. Cooked about 4 hours! Next time I will try tbirds recipe!

No suvivors!  We made this last year and the jerky was gone in less than a week.  The kids took it to school for snack.  Actually have some in the oven slow-cooking right now!  Such a great recipe!

well..  I'm surprised it has lasted through the drying process without being attacked and eaten raw..  I was prepared to rate it last night before it got into the oven, the marinade itself smells heavenly.  I did not have italian dressing mix, only an italian seasoning grinder mix which was amazing in it too.  Super, super recipe, if this rating had 10 stars I'd give it 11!

I'm addicted to this!  Used venison trimmings - no fault of the recipe, but make sure there is no fat on the venison otherwise it will turn rancid.  Going to make another batch with round.

Flavor = 5
Directions = 3.5

Very tasty stuff. Followed the instructions to the best of my ability: My Instruction tips and clarifications:

- Oven only goes down to 170, so started checking at 2.5 hours... pulled half at about 3 hrs.

- Aim for slices 1/8 in or less. Made a couple closer to the 1/4 in and ended up with some very tasty jerky chewing gum since I cut with the grain.

- Used skewers instead of the toothpicks to hang. Bit easier to load and unload, noticed no influence on cooking around the penetration point.

- SORT BY SIZE!!!! I know should have thought of this, but really the size will determine doneness, so i you have varying size slices, group on the skewers accordingly since the smaller/thinner will be done before the thicker pieces.

- When is it done? Take a piece out when you think it is where you want it, let it cool on the counter, try your handiwork.... IF it is good pull 'em, if it still needs longer then leave the rest in longer. (try not to eat the whole batch while testing doneness)

Again, Easy recipe, wonderful turn out if you watch it. Flavor is really close to classic Pemmican brand Jerky.

Next time, I think I might try cutting against the grain (I know blaspheme, but sometime I want the flavor without the  sore jaw)

The best ever! I have made 6 batches of beef jerky now and everyone loves it. I tried the recipe twice with deer and it was great as well. The last batch of deer jerky I added a tablespoon of honey and it made the meat a little more moist and less wild taste for my wife. A+ all the way! I was a great way to use up the rest of the deer meet from the freezer.

Great recipe!!  I made some changes but I'm sure it would've been 5 stars as written.  I used a bit less of the Worcestershire and onion powder and a little more soy sauce and hot sauce.  I also added a couple tablespoons of honey and brown sugar and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I used a bottom round roast, trimmed it of fat and sliced it myself (after putting it the freezer for a couple of hours).  My oven only went to 200 degrees and then to warm.  I stuck the thermostat halfway between and propped the door open an inch with a chopstick.  4 hours later I had the best beef jerky I've ever eaten.  My boyfriend agrees.  It's definitely -much-cheaper to make it yourself and I'm sure you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with the seasonings.  A little time consuming but well worth it.

I've made this twice now and it has turned out good both times. It's the first jerky recipe I've tried and I'm so glad I chose this one. I took another person's advice and used 1/2 cup worchestershire sauce. I used a little more soy sauce to make up the liquid. The first time I made it I didn't have any hot pepper sauce so I used some red pepper flakes instead. I used the hot pepper sauce this time and I like it better. I'm pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to make jerky.

Great recipe Terry.  My kids just ate it up, and I did too.  We followed your recipe just as written, next time I think we will cut back a little on the Worcestershire sauce and add more hot sauce.  If you have convection bake on your oven use it it works much better at drying out the meat. Thanks Terry

T Bird, my husband and I both thank you for this recipe. If I could give it 10 stars I would, it is the best. Have never made anything like this before but it is so simple anyone could do it. Added a touch of liquid smoke just to give it a taste of the outdoors. Husband said I can pack this for his lunch all the time and he would be a happy man. Thanks again..

Pretty good, just not quite the flavor I was looking for.  The cooking method worked very well though.  Also, be sure to cut ALL the fat off the meat slices, as the fat doesn't cook right.

Where do I send the reward, Dewy? This stuff is awesome (coming from someone who was never crazy about jerky)! I decided to make venison jerky for the first time and found this recipe and another recipe here (sweet & spicy)--this one was our favorite. Per one of the reviews, I did add a teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning and used a dehydrator. I gave a few samples away, and people who don't like venison really enjoyed this. I can't imagine jerky tasting any better than this--it was perfect. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe!!!! I did read in one of the reviews where they were concerned about mold on the Jerky... It has to be moisture to cause mold. Duh.... Now wouldn't that tell us that it wasn't dehydrated enough?? You know, give it more oven time so it dries out more.. I'm going to contiue this recipe from now on.  Thanks.  Gary.

This recipe works perfectly!  I didn't have enough worcestershire sauce on hand so I substituted HALF of it with liquid smoke (hickory), which I wanted to add anyway, and it came out great!  Other than liquid smoke I followed the recipe exactly.  I took it out after 4 hours and it's perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will make this for years to come.

Best  jerky i've ever had!
All I did different was minus the hot sauce and switched the salt with "hickory smoke salt".

Turned out great!

This was pretty good, although I do agree that the worcestershire taste is pretty dominant.  It gives the jerky a tangy taste which is kind of unusual.  I was afraid that marinating it overnight would make it too salty, but it turned out just fine.  Marinate in a ziploc freezer bag, kneading occasionally, for the best coverage.

Great recipe!  I trimmed all visible fat before cooking, and I also added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to the marinade.  Next time I make it, I will make sure to cut the meat as thin as possible.

I made this recipe with another, I followed the recipe to the t.  I live in Michigan and not sure if the recipe came from someome in higher altidudes.  The marinated beef smelled so good!  I used an "electric" oven.  I keep my eye on the jerky hourly, unfortunately it turned out very dry even when cutting back on baking time. I throw out the whole batch.  It appears that those that liked this recipe had "dehydrarors.  I think I will try the dehydrator method and may find I write a different review.

Never knew home-made beef jerky could be so easy to make and so tasty.  My husband and his co-workers said this was THE BEST beef jerky they've ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

This had great flavor. I did add a whole can of jalapeno peppers sliced the long way and seeded and added the jalapeno juice to the marinade, omitted the salt and used a dehydrator. This was just the right amount of soy and Worcestershire. I am making another batch because it did not last very long!

Very nice flavorful taste!  Dabbed the fat off the meat when it was done so it lasts longer.  Slicing the meat against the grain makes it easier to bite off pieces.

Simply delicious. The marinade actually makes this work, and the taste of that comes through even after a day or two.

I was afraid to add as much sodium to the meet as the recipe called for... but you couldn't tell once it was done - very tasty. It did take longer to cook than the recipe called for... I had some strips in the oven for 8 hrs.

Since I bought a food dehydrator a few months ago, this is the ONLY jerky marinade I use.  Absolutely fantastic!  While on a recent deep-sea fishing trip my four friends raved about the jerky I brought.  Because of this recipe, two were convinced to buy a dehydrator, and one has since bought 5 pounds of London Broil for me to make for him.

turned out like some really thin cooked meat. wasnt too excited. also it cost more than just purchasing the kind i really like. i did follow the recipe and dried in the oven. would be better from the smoker or dehydrator i think

I make this every year with venison.The secret is slicing the meat thin and it helps to have the roast somewhat frozen.I have a gas oven that will only reduce to 170 degrees so this is what I dry it on. I put the meat on cookie sheets sprayed with Pam and turn meat over halfway through drying.It shrinks alot and takes about 10-12 hours to dry totally but it is delicious.

I thought this was an excellent and flavorful jerky recipe.  It is not as salty as other jerky recipes I've tried, but i think that is a good thing.  The italian seasonign adds an unexpected flavor and the hot sauce gives it a kick that replaces the need for more salt.  Very flavorful!

Fantastic beef jerky.  This is probably one of the best recipes I've used for my home-made jerky.  Followed the recipe to a "T"(spoon) and it turned out tasty without being overpowering.

Thank you - This recipe is great! Tastes like store bought but w/out the chemicals! The only things I changed were to add about 10-20 squirts of liquid smoke, and I also just hung them right on the oven rack - since the oven doesn't get really hot for jerky, the rack isn't too hard to clean. Thanks T Bird!

First time I have made jerky.  It was a HIT!
My daughter and son both had to be rationed or they would have ate it all the first night. Both agreed that this beat any store bought jerky they had had.
My oven does not vent well so I cracked the door a bit to let moisture out.  Still took about 10 hours to fully dry at 160 degrees.

We draw names in our family each Christmas and make something homemade.  I have three grown nephews who always appreciate food.  I made this for one my nephews when I drew his name for homemade Christmas - everyone was trying to steel it from him.  Great taste and easy to make.

Very tasty! I added a small amount of brown sugar as suggested, and some liquid smoke. Also used a 3-4 lb rump roast. Wasn't sure what the directions indicated so I sliced it into 1/4 inch slices, then 1/4 inch strips, maybe this is why it seemed to cook quicker. In just over 3 hours mine was quite dry and chewy. Very easy to throw together - the most time consuming thing is toothpicking the meat and hanging it. And it does smell strong while cooking and leaves a mess in the bottom of the oven, I just used one of those disposable foil trays and then threw it out! I've never tried jerky before but we all loved it, especially husband and son. I plan to make it again, just wish I knew more about how to store it and how long it should last (if it didn't get gobbled so quickly).

I was happy overall how this came out, but had a tough start. I wasn't sure how to get the meat sliced thinly, so I asked the butcher. He proceeded to slice into chunks a $14 cut of meat. I almost cried. I took the meat home and cut it again, it took me almost 40 minutes. The marinade was great, but I like it spicy so I added 3 teaspoons of hot sauce, still wasn't hot enough, I then added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I was nervous about the drying in my oven, but I did exactly as stated and it turned out great.

well, t-bird, this is a GREAT starting point, but for me, the flavor of the worchestershire sauce is too overpowering.  i'm going to add some hickory smoked salt, more garlic and tone down the worchestershire in the next batch... the only change i made to the recipe was to add a little bit of brown sugar, maybe a couple of tablespoons, since i didn't really measure it.  i still give it 4 stars since it IS good and got a great review from my husband!  thanks for the recipe!

Everyone LOVES this recipe!!  I double the hot sauce to 2 tsp of habanero sauce.  Whenever I make it I always get asked for more!  I need a bigger dehydrator to keep up with the demand!  This is an AWESOME recipe!! Thanks for sharing  =)

This was the most disgusting recipe I have ever tried!  I placed even the thick foil down in the bottom of my oven and it still soaked through.  The drippings on top of the foil smelled like they were going to ignite any second and ended up causing all the "jerky" to reek of smoke.  I think I'll just buy my jerky from now on!!  Maybe with a dehydrator and a better cut of meat.  Yuck

Tried this after all the rave reviews. It's OK. All I can really task is Worcestershire and a little soy. I'll eat it, but won't be making this one again.

I was not at all impressed by the jerky.  The main problem is the  Worcestershire sauce.  The taste dominates everything else in the recipe, and, to me at least, it is not a taste I expect or like in jerky.  I prepared it as per the recipe, but I would not make this recipe again.

I made this recipe and "Jerky Lover's Jerky" recipe.  Followed each one exactly.  We did not like this one as the taste was too strong and there was WAY too much powder (onion and garlic) left on the meat.  The other recipe was perfect to our taste and the texture was great!  If the powder was reduced, it might make a difference but really, the taste was not to our liking!

I didn't use the exact ingredients from this recipe for my beef jerky. However, I just used it for tips on making the jerky. My oven does not go down to 150 degrees, so I put it somewhere between warm and 200. TIP!! = hang a thermometer from the oven rack to check and make sure your oven is at the right temperature. It was extremely tricky to get it to the right temperature and I had to make several adjustments. Another tip..I hung my jerky from toothpicks, but the meat kind of curled around itself, so after being in the oven about 2 hours, I realized it wasn't drying out completely, so I took the jerky off the toothpicks and laid them across the oven racks. (With the park that didn't dry facing down). This was extremely important to ensure that all the jerky dried properly! My jerky ended up being a huge success! However, I think I may buy a dehydrator to make it a little less stressful next time! =)

This turned out great! I made mine in my food dehydrator and I have yet to master that...as I dried it out a little too much... it was almost brittle. I will try a few more times and I will get it figured. It had very good flavor tho! Thanks!

I make this to take camping, but if I make it too far in advance it all gets eaten before we leave the house! It's one of the best jerky recipes I've tried. I've started doubling the amount of hot sauce to give a little more kick.

Awesome beef jerky! I bought a food dehydrator and couldn't wait to make some beef jerky. I choose this recipe and I am so glad I did. My 3 year old son loved it as well! I will be making it again and again!

This is a good recipe, almost idetical to mine. I do change mine often as my tastefor it might be different from one day to the next. 
The only thing I do different is I use skeewers to hang mine. Can usually get 8 or 9 slices on each skeewer. You just don't want them touching.

I have made this in the dehydrator several times.  i got the butcher to slice the meat for consistancy.  a few times i added pepper flakes and extra hot sauce for a spicier version and it is always been excellent.  my son has a teacher who offers cookies for my beef jerky.  I will always use this recipe since it NEVER looses!

I used this recipe with venison and it was very good.  Will try it with elk, next.  
I also used a food dehydrator instead of an oven.

This is easy and great tasting.  I skipped the toothpicks and hung the meat directly over the racks in the oven....that is what the invented self cleaning ovens for!  Have made numerous times in little and double batches.

Hey! This was a great marinade for jerky.  Only, I cut the recipe down because I used a 2 pound shoulder roast. I omitted the onion powder and hot sauce, and cut down the soy sauce to about an 1/8 cup. Also, I used a whole (small) packet of dry italian seasoning mix. And cooking time in my food dehydrator was about 8 hours.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I don't know what happened, but this turned out awful for me. I think it was too much worchestershire sauce for my family. The worchestershire sauce gave the jerky a fuzzy texture, too. It could have been the worchestershire sauce, but I'll stick with my usual recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't find this to be appealing.  I guess I like a sweeter result.  I may try this once more to see if I get the same results, but on a much smaller scale...

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. It took about 5.5 hours in my oven. Took the jerky to poker night to see what everyone thought. We all agreed it was the best we’ve ever had...commercial or otherwise. (And that’s saying a lot) For years I’ve tried to nail down a recipe and process. This is it!!!

This jerky is bomb.  Tip: after you cut your meat up, use a tenderizer before marination.  Then after marinating, pound it out again and it turns out really flavourful and tender.  I feel like the amount of Worcestershire is a little too much also so I cut that down a bit.  Fantastic recipe

I use a dehydrator for drying the deer and elk meat with a bit more pepper then add a small amount of  liquid smoke. I typically exclude the salad dressing  seasoning. I like to pair this with Teriyaki Beef Jerky or Jerky Lover's Jerky- Sweet,  Hot and Spicy for variety.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for...the only difference was that the meat marinated for 2 days as we prepped for Hurricane Irma.  My oven would only go down to 170 degrees so by 3 hours, it was done and delicious!!!  Will be making this again.

I made this according to directions leaving out only the hot pepper sauce as I cannot tolerate heat. I threaded the jerky strips onto long metal BBQ skewers and hung them in the oven over the top rack. The last bit of space I hung from toothpicks (I have a wide oven). Removed all lower shelves. Placed aluminum foil in base to collect drips. Put the oven temp on 65 C and timer on for 4.5 hours, with a wooden spoon in the oven door to keep slightly open and went to bed. The oven turns off automatically. In the morning I had perfect jerky!
I made this for a church pioneer activity. Some people who don't normally like beef jerky at all, tried it and loved it. They are looking forward to me making it again for another church activity coming up. I have made it 3 times so far. Went searching for the recipe again because I didn't save it. Took me a few months to find it again. Now saved. Making it again today.
PERFECT!!!!

I was looking for a recipe without sugar or honey and found it. Love love love this recipe. One thing I did differently was to cook it for the time specified then turned it and void for 2 more hours. I cooked it on a baking sheet with rack instead of hanging it. Yummy.

I felt I should write a review since we've been enjoying this recipe for a couple of years. Every time I want to try a new jerky recipe, my husband says no, it has to be this one. We buy London broil when it's on sale, freeze it for a couple of hours to make slicing easier (1/4 inch thick, remove all fat.) We then follow the recipe just as written. If I don't have Italian dressing mix on hand, I use some herbs I dried from my garden, such as oregano, basil, parsley, and thyme. We cook it in a dehydrator.

I changed it up a bit because my wife doesn't do well with pepper.  So I did 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp herb pepper and 1/2 tsp paprika. The flavor was intense. Most of the 4 lbs is already gone. Note to self. Volleyball teams (and their parents) eat a lot of jerky. Make more.

The seasoning worked out really well with the meat I used - beef eye round - sliced super thin from the asian market. I see myself making more very soon.

Probably the best jerky I've ever eaten. I used a thinly sliced venison roast instead of beef.  I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly and could tell it was a great taste as-is, but because of my own personal preference, I decided to add some brown sugar (about 1/3 cup) to the marinade.  After it marinated for 24 hours, I put it in my digital dehydrator at 158 degrees for about 3 hours.  It came out  PERFECT.  Not too dry, not too chewy, just tender and flavorful! This is definitely a keeper recipe for use after every deer season!

Very easy! Great flavor! No dehydrator needed.  Instead of toothpicks, I used skewers and chopsticks. A lot less labor-intensive and easy to arrange on the rack.

Like many it was my first time making Jerky, and this is the first thing that popped up on a google search. I followed the recipe fairly closely, the only difference was that I halved everything since I wanted to try something different with the other 2lbs of meet I had. Cooked at 170 (oven doesn't go down to 150) for a little under 4 hours and the texture came out as expected.  Only change I would recommend is letting marinate for 2 days rather than 1, which I'm going to try next time. I would also suggest cutting jerky into smaller strips and hanging from one end rather than looping them to get a evenly distributed cook through. Overall good recipe!

I followed the recipe quite closely and I liked the end result save one thing.  The soya I used was regular and as a result, the meat came out rather salty.  Still very yummy but not so good for you as a result.  Next time I would use salt reduced soya or cut it with some water.

It's not bad, but it's not great. Weird aftertaste. This was the last online recipe I tried before I listened to my friend finally who recommended that marinade jerky gold. That seasoning was fantastic! This wasn't bad but wasn't great.

I added minced onion instead of onion powder and garlic salt instead of garlic powder. Also, added dried basil and oregano instead of Italian dressing mix. Turned out great!

this was my first time making jerky.  turned out PERFECT on the first try! i only omitted the pepper and hot sauce.  you can simply hang it from the oven rack with great results and little cleanup. it is VERY important to cover the bottom rack unless you really enjoy the smell of burning fat and soy sauce. i cut mine into very small pieces so it only took 3 hours in the oven.  

trust me, it is hard to mess this recipe up!

My 14-year old son loves beef jerky and wanted to try making some at home.  We made this and it is absolutely amazing.  His eyes were so big when he bit into it -- I don't think he expected it to be that good!  We did use low-sodium soy sauce, and thought the saltiness level was perfect.  We also cooked one batch in the oven and one in our dehydrator so we could compare -- they were equally good, although the dehydrator took much longer.  We didnt hang the meet in the oven as directed in the recipe. We just put it on a rack in a roasting pan and turned it periodically.  Outstanding!

I have been through a lot of Jerky recipes and this recipe is definatly at the top of the few recipes that have turned out well. Tenderizing the meat is a great touch and help a graet deal with cooking times, texture after cooked and flavor.

Everyone who tried this loved it, and my  husband said "this is what jerky is supposed to taste like".  It's very tasty, easily customizable (I used Very Very Teriyaki by Soy Vay instead of soy sauce, and buffalo sauce instead of hot pepper, since I didn't have the other ingredients).  Great base flavor with a kick.  Will use over and over again.  Thanks!

I like my jerky to be pretty spicy so I added crushed red pepper and used about 4 tsp. of tabasco chipotle pepper sauce.  Everyone at work loved the jerky!  Awesome recipe.

I've been using this site for years and this is the recipe that made me register!  In a word, fan-freakin-tastic!  Had the butcher cut the meat, trimmed the fat off myself, let soak about 20 hours.  My oven only goes down to 170, but it worked out great... kept sneaking bites as it cooked :)  Can't wait to try the oven method with other flavor marinades! Thanks T-Bird!!!

Excellent jerky-made as directed and it was pretty tasty but I would add more hot sauce next time. This is an update to review  I've made this jerky at least 10 times now with just minor tweaks. (added a little red pepper). Literally everyone who tries it says it's the best jerky they've ever had! Way better than any store-bought jerky. Invested in de-hydrator to speed up drying time (4-5 hrs) and not having to hang with toothpicks is much easier.

This beef jerky was easy to make and the directions were great, but honestly I thought it was laking any real flavor.  Will continue to search for the perfect beef jerky recipe.

This jerky was great! The family likes it a lot. My oven worked great with this recipe and I hung about 10 bamboo skewars each holding about 6 strips of beef. Made the house smell wonderful and the dogs love it too. Easy and tasty without all crud that store bought has in it.

What a great recipe!  I used london broil and had the butcher slice the beef thin lengthwise and followed all the instructions.  When done I took the beef out of the oven and placed it in my dehydrator for an extra 4 to 5 hours.  I even tried teriyaki style using teriyaki sauce instead of shoyu (leaving out the Worcestershire sauce) and used more pepper, onion powder and hot sauce and it was also a hit!  Thank you for sharing!

The method works great, I just needed to alter the ingredients to better suit my taste.

I liked the flavor, but don't think I cooked it long enough. The meat was too chewy... I will re-try this one.

The firt time I made this I followed the directions to a T and it was very good.  The second time I omitted the garlic (NOT a big garlic fan) and halved the onion poweder and my husband and I loved it!!  Thanks for a wonderfull recipe I know I will be using for a very long time.  My search is finally over.

The taste is great!  I used round steak, the thinnest I could find in the store, and it still was pretty thick for beef jerky.  Next time I'm going to keep my eye out for london broil when it's marked down, and have the butcher slice it paper thin.  Other than the thickness, the taste was great!  It only lasted a day in my house.

A client of mine told me about this website and this recipe and i'm hooked on both. I made this several times. I usually have to triple the batch and hide some of it or my family has it gone in no time. I've taken it camping,its a great treat.
Thank-you Terry
