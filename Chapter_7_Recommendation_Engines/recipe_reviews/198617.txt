I will agree somewhat with WERFLY.  This was written toward my some of my families tastebuds (which can be a little wimpy at times).  That's the one I submitted.  I prefer it marinated all day with the rootbeer and a tablespoon of worchestershire, heavily salted/peppered prior to grilling.  2 teaspoons chipotle sauce and I also use Campbells 2x strength beef broth to start for this.  The reduction down to 3/4 cup is approximate (I tend not to measure things-rather go by taste), it should be pretty potent and salty sweet.  Remember, you have to taste everything and make sure to adjust seasoning to your families tastes.

This recipe is awesome!  I let the chops sit in the root beer for about 6 hours.  WARNING- Do not make if you don't love good food!  EDIT- I thought I should add I let the chops marinate for 6 hours because that is the amount of time I had.  Defintely will do it for longer next time.  Also, I used a charcoal grill, which lends a nice flavor in my opinion.  In addition, my pepper mill is filled with a combo of black, white and red pepper corns, which is a wonderful combo that adds another flavor dynamic.  Finally, I used habanero hot sauce (Big Ben's BBQ brand- which I highly recommend), instead of chipotle flavored.  Very tasty.  A tip of my hat to you Ken!

Because it's unbelieveably cold out, I can't grill these like I would have liked. So....what I did was combine all the ingredients (with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch wisked in), braised my pork chops and stuck everything in the crockpot. Only change I made was adding in some sliced onions and minced garlic that I sauteed in the pan that I braised the pork chops in. I didn't need the extra salt as my beef broth and the worchestershire was salty enough on it's own. This made for some very tasty and moist pork chops but it needs a little something else. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe a tablespoon of dijon? A bay leaf? I liked the combination of the root beer and beef broth, it was sweet and beefy all at the same time.....it's just missing just a little somethin'-somethin'. This went really well with mashed potatoes. NOTE: I also used Campbell's beef broth only because it's double strength and has a stronger flavor than your usual boxed broth. I used a quality root beer, too. I think that makes all the difference.

WOW, that was unexpectedly soooo good.  My husband doesn't really love porkchops but he said he would have liked a big pile of them.  I told him there was a secret ingredient (RB) and he forbid me to tell him because they were so good.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have hot sauce) and they were wonderful.  A++ and I will make again!

After talking to Ken about my experience with this recipe, I decided on reviewing it two ways. First of all, as written, while still producing a tender finished dish, I give it a 4, for the fact that, even beyond "personal taste", I think this would be a bit bland, but with SO much potential. That said, it turns into an easy 5 star with Ken's changes, which he states in his review.  So, I added more chipotle hot sauce, a fair bit of black pepper, more Worcestershire sauce, and I did marinate the chops in all of those ingredients, not just the root beer.  Followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  We used Barq's root beer because we much prefer the "bite" to it, as opposed to a sweeter one.  I would do it all the same next time, other than omitting the brown sugar, but, again, that's only a personal taste in not liking things as sweet as some, do.  That does NOT lower my rating. :) Thank you, Ken, for the addition and the clarifying review. :)

I really wanted to love this recipe.  I love root beer and I'm always looking for new ways to do pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly - marinating in the root beer and then using fresh root beer to combine with the other ingredients and reducing the liquid down to 3/4 cup and using it as a 'glaze' while grilling.  The end result was -- ok.  The chops were a little on the sweet side - but that's really all there was.  It seemed like a lot of effort for only an 'ok' end result.  For us, they were average - not bad - but not particularly special. **8/23/2010 update - I used the leftovers from this in the Pork Salad Croissant recipe from this site.  The leftovers worked GREAT in this salad.  The sweetness of the root beer was a nice complement to the spice of the chutney in the recipe and worked well with the apple and grape.

A keeper!  My husband and I made this for my mother visiting from out of state.  I did use a tsp of the chipotle tabasco sauce and I still felt it could have used a little more kick but my Mom thought it was perfect as I had made it, a good balance.

I'd printed this recipe off and gave it to my dad for him to make sometime (I'm not big on grilling, myself) and he finally got around to it tonight. It was a winner! We all ate it and enjoyed it. My dad said it took more work than he usually likes to put into cooking supper, but I consider that a good thing - much better than a bottled sauce or marinade. Thanks for the great recipe Ken.

DELISH! Another Ken winner! Used pork steaks instead of chops. Excellent! Mixed all ingredients with two cups root beer and marinated two steaks overnight. Upped Worchestershire sauce to a tbsp. and hot pepper sauce to one tsp., added four cloves minced garlic and two sliced scallions. Grilled five minutes on each side. Reduced marinade to thin bbq sauce consistancy. Nice grilled pork change all round. Thank you Ken!

Made as written with Ken's changes (see Feb. 20/10 review), My only regret was I didn't marinate the chops longer.  The reduction is delicious. A new twist for grilled pork chops.  Next time I plan on dividing the sauce - some for basting and thickening the rest with a bit of cornstarch to make a gravy.  Thanks Ken. terrific recipe.

Excellent! We loved it and it was so moist even though we cooked it a bit too long. It looks fabulous coming off the grill. This is a keeper for my next party!

What a great unique flavor these chops have. I marinated overnight. Did not have chipotle hot sauce so used Franks Extra Hot instead. I also added cornstarch to the sauce to make it more of a gravy. Who would have thought Rootbeer?

These were excellent.  I followed the directions mostly.  I marinated overnight, but I pricked the chops all over with a fork.  I used a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  I started to grill the chops and realized the marinade wasn't reducing as quickly as I wanted it to so I put the chops on the rack while I reduced that sauce.  As it reduced I noticed it needed a bit more zip for my liking and I added a couple of sprinkles of clove to it.  This turned out to be a good choice.  This recipe is incredible.  I will keep my modifications and no matter what this will be made again and again!  Thanks Ken from CA!!!

Wish I would have read Ken's update before I made these.  They were very bland even after marinating 6 hours.  Will remake with ken's changes and reviw again.  I agree with Werfly

We've made this recipe a few times now and it is one of our favorites!  My one tip is to use a good bottled root beer that has a good bite to it.

Ok, these were pretty good, but not "out of this world" good. Having said this, my hubs accepts full responsibility for the outcome of our dinner (he is the Grill Master at our house). :) My biggest gripe is simple.... Our pork chops were DRY! Either Ken's cooking directions (i.e. timing) are off or our grill was too hot. It could also be the cut of meat we purchased (center cut chops), but I'm leaning toward operator error lol. Another, albeit minor gripe is that I tasted very little of the glaze. I even chose Barq's root beer because of its spicy bite. I'm not sure If most of it cooked off or if my hubs forgot to slather what was left on each chop before serving. It's a real shame tho because the glaze was AWESOME!!! as Ken suggested, I upped the chipotle hot sauce to 2 t and used 2x concentrated (Campbell's) broth. If the marinade weren't so darn hot (whoa Ken!), I would have drank it all! :) in retrospect, i think a t of chipotle sauce would have been spot on. NOTE: I thought the glaze was supposed to thicken, but it didn't (don't be alarmed). Even tho it's thin, it coats really well. I just need to figure out how to do a better job of ensuring that it does its magic on the grill! Served with baked potatoes and fresh corn on the cobb, this was a satisfying summer meal. Thanks for sharing, Ken in CA! :-)

The glaze turned out good but I agree with another who said it didn't glaze the chop well.  The chop was bland with just a hint of root beer flavor.  Had I known I would have saved some, if not most, of the glaze for dipping the end product, kind of like an au jus.  Or thicken it and use as a sauce.  Preparing it as written was a big waste of time.

This is a great way to prepare pork chops.  The root beer gives it a sweet taste, but it's not overpowering - just right.  Everyone from my 2 yr old ds to mom really enjoyed these.  Thanks Ken for another great recipe!

KEN!  You did it again! :D  I had to do these on my indoor grill because (although it's mild for this time of year) it's still a little chilly to do anything outside.  I added a litle too much hot sauce, which gave me a heart attack (but I'm not cooking if there's not at least one of those per recipe)!  I added a little more brown sugar, root beer, and a couple shots of lemon juice, which cut the hot.  (Hubby's Irish descent, and I'm Norwegian so our taste buds are VERY boring!)  I overcooked the chops, but that was my fault!  The flavour and tenderness are amazing!  Thanks again, for spicing up our week with "to die for" food!  You ROCK!

Didn't love it...but it did make the pork chops moist.  Maybe next time I'll use "good" root beer.  I used generic.  It was kind of a weird flavor pairing for all of the family.  Most likely won't try it again.

So good!!! I was a little leary with the sauce the first time I tasted it, but once it reduced it was great!! I also used Franks hot sauce-its all we had. Will for sure make again!! We even used cheapy chops and off brand root beer! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Ken!

We really enjoyed this recipe. DH loves root beer soda, does not like pork,but  he did like them this way. Chops were very tender and flavorful. Great recipe Ken, thank you.

Good! I marinated the chops for 18 hours in rootbeer and Worcestershire and they were very flavorful. Served over white rice to soak up the sauce. Thanks :)

Nice change of pace.  We really enjoyed the flavor.  I did add more chipotle hot sauce and worcesteshire sauce and I am glad I did.  It might not have had enough flavor without the additions.

These pork chops were sensational!  My hubby grilled to perfection, they were moist & flavorful.  They smell so good while they are cooking.  I halved the recipe since cooking for two, but otherwise followed exactly.  If you love root beer like I do, you will be very pleased with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing this, Ken, delicious!

Excellent! Followed Ken's notes from 2/20 and these chops were delicious. Tender, juicy and full of flavor. A couple of the kids were here for dinner and wanted to know when we would be making these again. It will be soon and often! Thanks for sharing, Ken!

These were absolutely delicious! I followed the directions exactly except i did add a little more hot sauce because we like that little extra kick.  I will definitely be making these frequently this summer.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

4/11/2010:  First let me say that I hate pork chops.  I make them occasionally because my children love them, but I usually eat a couple bites and then give the rest of my portion to the kids.  NOT TODAY!  This recipe is amazing!  The weather worked against me, so I couldn't get my charcoal hot enough for a nice sear on the outside of the chops and I also got impatient and didn't let the sauce reduce far enough, so it was a little thin, but I still enjoyed my portion so much that I finished the whole thing!  Thanks, Ken, for giving me a pork chop recipe I can enjoy as much as my kids!!  7/13/2010:  UPDATE - I made these again a couple days ago, using Ken's suggestions for adding worcestershire to the marinade, upping the chipotle sauce in the glaze, and liberally salting and peppering the chops before grilling.  I also had better success with getting my coals good and hot (it WAS 100+ degrees outside, after all!) and was also more patient with the glaze, so it reduced nicely and got very thick.  With the changes and the increased patience on my part, these were even better than five-star good!  I had leftovers for lunch at work today and the chop was so tender I was able to cut it with a plastic knife.  These are now most definitely going to be in our regular meal rotation.  Thanks again, Ken!

Oh YEAH. Seasoned the chops with a salt-free seasoning blend before soaking in the root beer.  Reduced the root beer from the marinade along with the extra, used 1 beef boullion cube and "red hot" sauce (no chipotle), brown sugar, and the worcestershire. Had to strain out some solids and reduced it down to about a 1/4C (for 4 chops), so it took a while, but the reduction syrup was worth it. Peppered the chops and lightly salted with seasoned salt before grilling on the Foreman. Yum, Yum YUM. Great way to use up some root beer that had went flat. ;)

This was really good. My husband couldn't get enough and my kids happily ate theirs. Very good as is, or with bbq as a dip.

I put my chops in a plastic container and poured enough root beer from a 2L to cover them. 

For the sauce I used 12oz of the root beer from the chops. I didn't measure the worcestershire or hot sauce. After simmering for a while I strained the cooked bit of blood out of it and then simmered some more. I used steak seasoning instead of regular s&p and grilled the chops. Once they were mostly done I dunked them into the pan of reduced liquid. Cooked hte rest of the way and dunked again.  Very good.

We added a tsp. of dijon mustard to the sauce which made it much less cloying and actually much more tasty.  We found it way too sweet.  The mustard helped a great deal!

As other reviewers have said...SO wanted to like this recipe.  Everybody loves root beer, right?  The biggest problem I had was that the reduction sauce did not reduce. I was expecting a thick, sweet, almost bbq-y consistency but mine was all liquid despite simmering it for over half an hour.  So in essence we had no sauce. Not sure what happened but that is 3 cans of root beer I will never get back! :-(

This was okay. I marinated the chops all day in the root beer, but in the end, I thought they would have a lot more flavor. They has a slight root beer taste, but not much else. It did make the chops very juicy, so that was a plus, but I felt like there was more I had expected out of the recipe.

This was awesome.  My husband gave it an A+.  Two things:  (1) It took longer than I thought to make the reduction (more than 30 min!), so I turned up the heat and this helped. It was also the first time I've made a reduction, so I can blame inexperience.  (2) When it was reduced enough in volume, it was still too runny.  So I added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch and heated until it made a nice glaze.  I don't have a grill, so I broiled the porkchops and basted with the glaze.  I served them over rice with extra glaze on top and green beans.  The porkchops were tender and not dry.  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was okay.  I usually brine pork chops, so I thought a root beer brine sounded like a good idea.  The pork chops had too much of a root beer flavor for my taste.  I guess I expected a more nuanced flavor, but the pork chops mostly tasted like salty root beer.

I'm sure I didn't follow this recipe closely enough and made too many changes. Trying to make it diet friendlier, I used diet rootbeer, Splenda Brown Sugar, and thin pork chops. I loved the reduction sauce, but the chops didn't have much flavor after marinating all afternoon in the root beer. I ended up using the sauce like a French dip. I'm thinking it would have made a great marinade.

Wonderful! We really liked this recipe. Due to the temp being 19 degrees out, I cooked these on a cast iron griddle on my stove top. Can't wait to try it on a charcoal grill. We thought the chops were very good if just a little bland. We like spicy. Next time I will add more of the hot sauce for a bit more kick. Overall, we thought it was a great recipe. Thanks Ken from CA!

I love me some meat but pork is my least favorite of them with the exception of bacon. I followed the recipe exactly and went with Ken's review. This gave bacon some competition. I thoroughly enjoyed these and plan on making them often. Thank you Ken! As always, I appreciate you.

Awwwww Man....these were AWESOME!!!! Made them for dinner tonight and everybody's plates were cleaned. I didn't grill them though. I baked them in the over for about 10 minutes then poured the sauce over them and let them cook until they were done. Also, I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce instead of the chipotle hot sauce. Note: it takes a little time for the reduction, so start it a little ahead of time. Oh and I did marinate them overnight in root beer and worchestershire sauce.

We had these for dinner and they are fabulous.  Thanks Ken for a great recipe.  I like how the sauce did not over power the taste of the pork.  YUM

You know when a new movie comes out and everyone tells you it's the greatest movie of all time and when you're leaving the theater you're thinking well it was good but not GREAT. That's how I felt about this recipe.  It was good but all the hype made me expect more.  Made it for company and they thought it was OK.  We all did agree the pork chops were very moist and tender but still not that special.

I had thin pork chops and followed the recipe. I was worried that the thin chops would be too easily over done on the grill but hubby came through! We picked these up and ate them with our fingers like a pair of heathens and we loved every bite! Good recipe and thank you very much, Ken. Will make again!

These chops were excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except I let them marinate overnite. Even my picky eater son who usually will not eat pork chops loved them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Ken!

Very tasty.  The chops cooked up very nice and juicy.  Great flavor.  I increased the chipotle sauce to 2 tsp.

First of all, Thank you Ken! I did make this recipe with ribs instead of the chops. I marinated the ribs for 2 days. Really good tasting.  Take my advise, if you make the ribs, bake them, then finish on the grill. I know better, the sugars caused mine to get a little too scorched. The family ate them and said they loved them anyway!  Thanks Ken! I will make these again:)

I kept pretty exact to the recipe, save having a little less pork chop than recommended. I also did not have access to grill so I used a pan. I also was expecting the sauce to be a bit thicker than it was. I will definitely be making it again, I really loved it. I may need to figure a way to make it thicker.

Bought 2L bottle (cheaper)
. Marinate with root beer, remaining beef broth, and Worcestershire. 
Sauce - added more beef boullean (1tsp?), deleted brown sugar, added a bit of tobacco to hot sauce, a pinch of cayenne pepper, 1 tblsp Worcestershire (takes about 30-40 min to reduce to about 3/4 cup)

I made this twice with tenderloin rather than chops. First time per the recipe and it was good. The second time I added a shot of Worcestershire, a chopped chipotle and ground pepper to the marinade which stayed in the bag for 8 hours. Using my favorite go to, Tuong Ot Sriracha chili sauce in the glaze rather than chipotle, I reduced it to 1/4  and brushed it on the last 5 minutes of grill time and on the final 1 inch slices when plated. Wow! This it's a keeper now!

These were pretty good.  There was a lot of different flavors in there and for that, we decided we'd make them again.  The problem is we had to make them in the oven instead of grill due to the MN winter.  We'll try to grill them next time.

The men in my family who ate these this weekend for Sunday dinner don't even like pork chops, and they LOVED these!  The marinade adds a slightly sweet taste, which is perfect for pork.  I loved them too.

I have never reviewed a recipe - but this one is so good!!!  I planned to marinate overnite as another reviewer suggested, but due to circumstances I had to leave the chops in the fridge for an additional day.  I was concerned about the flavor, but it was delicious.  Even my hubby said this is a keeper!!!  Thanks for the interesting recipe.

I would never have imagined a sweet pork chop recipe but this recipe pulls it off quite well. reading some of the other comments it seems I would have been better letting them soak longer in the root beer. Which as an interesting side note, I actually had used a diet A&W root beer which came out quite well.

These smelled delicious but I did not like the flavor of them at all, and neither did my daughter. My husband loved them though, so I am compromising between his five stars and my one.

Far too much work for very little flavor.  The root beer flavor grilled well, but we still found it to be bland.

This was great!  I prepared it exactly as the recipe states (which is difficult for me, since I always want to change someting).  The only thing I would have liked is the glaze to be a little thicker with the reduction.  My husband who usually only loves breaded chops actually enjoyed these!  This recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was a weird combo to start with but thought we would give it a try but it just didn't work for us.

This came out delicious, just sweet enough, with a wonderful flavor.  My only problem was my inability to get the sauce to thicken up.  I still used it, it was just a little thin.  Overall nice recipe, next time I might add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it.

The reduced sauce had a good flavor but we thought it needed something so we added six drops of hot sauce and a tablespoon of datil pepper vinegar which gave it more zing. Still the sauce was thin and didn't glaze the chops very well. For all the time and work stirring to reduce the sauce, the results were lackluster. I ended up eating mine with mustard.

This was a very good recipe and is definitely on my list to try again.  I marinated for about 4 hours in the rootbeer but found the pork did not pick up any flavour from that at all.  I may do it overnight next time.  The reduction though was fantastic and totally paired perfectly with the grilled chop.

This was a very good recipe. My whole family loved it! I followed the directions but I substituted bbq sauce for the chipotle hot sauce, it was a very mild root beer taste witch was good it wasn't over powering the pork!   A+ for me

Died and gone to heaven via a pork chop marinated in Rootbeer. I let it marinate all day and it rocked. Won't waste my time though with the reduction sauce. Really not that exciting and the chops don't need it.

I thought these were really great, and my boys loved them (even the one who hates root beer). I made the adjustments recommended by Ken's update, and marinated for about 6 hours. They were fantastic, and I love that they are low-fat. I will definitely be serving these again.

Exceptional chops!  I let them marinate in the root beer for about 4 hours and they turned out great.  Tons of compliments from the family, and a happily full belly :)

These pork chops definitely had a different kick to them. I marinated them in root beer, salt, pepper, and Worchester sauce while I was at work. I followed the directions for the sauce exactly, increasing the hot sauce slightly. These pork chops were very tender and I really enjoyed the sauce. Next time I will increase the hot sauce because I like my food on the spicier side. Overall, I will be making these again!

My grill has been buried in an pile of snow 8 feet deep since December.  It finally broke free so I was looking for the perfect recipe to welcome it back and boy was this it!  These chops were so moist and tender with just the right amount of sweetness.  We enjoyed them tremendously.  My one complaint?  I wish I had made MORE!  Chalk this one up to another great recipe from Ken!  Please keep the recipes coming!

Super DUPER yummy chops! I'm not even all that great at grilling, but these really did turn out fabulous! We used some left-over, un-fizzified homemade rootbeer, and it worked great. We'll for sure be making these again. We had company over for this dinner, and everyone loved it! 5 thumbs up!

I made the recipe exactly as it was presented and the sauce didn’t set at all, just remained watery. As a result, the pork had very little flavor. I am not planning on making it again.

Very little flavor, despite marinating for 11 hours. Thought the sauce would thicken/caramelize after reduction, but it remained thin. Took the leftovers (since no one wanted seconds) and diced them up and put it in homemade BBQ sauce for sandwiches. Won't make this recipe again.

I thought this was a creative, exciting way to prepare pork chops, a meat I love to eat.  However, they were just sweet with a bit of spice on the back end.  No flavor of the root beer came through.  That's what I was really looking forward to.  It wasn't bad, just not what I hoped for.

If you're a root beer fan, you will LOVE this pork dish. If you're not, you'll like it anyway.  It was a big hit with my root beer lover . I wouldn't bother with the sauce again because I couldn't get it thick enough. Just marinating in sugar free root beer overnight was enough

My family wasn’t a fan of the root beer marinade.  I didn’t use the sauce to baste, as I didn’t car for the flavor.  Blah.  Used bbq sauce to finish grilling.

I didn't use the hot sauce which may have made the difference. The pork chops were tender but not overly flavorful. Probably won't make again.

Made the recipe as directed, but didn't find the chops to be any extra flavourful.  They were very juicy and did not dry out at all as sometimes pork chops can when they are bbq'd.  Next time I would make the reduction, let it cool and marinate the chops in the reduction.

It's a winner. The reduction sauce is delicious! I used 3/4 inch bone-in pork chops from Costco instead of 1 inch. I almost over cooked them after 5 minutes on one side and three on the other. They were still a little pink inside, and everybody loved them.

The marinade of 2 hours and the sauce put on the end was kind of Blah.

I made the following changes and it was amazing!

-Marinated overnight and added worcestershire sauce to the marinate
-Cooked chops in cast iron skillet (added liquid smoke to get that grill flavor) 
-Used Sriracha instead of chipotle sauce
-Added a corn starch slurry to sauce to help it thicken

I used Shiracha instead of hot sauce and I found that it overwhelmed the taste of the root beer. Next time I will cut the schiracha  in half. Good recipe!

Keeper - Really good flavor. 
I cooked the sauce down to thick or ~ 1 cup. 
Also added W sauce and 1 t garlic powder to root beer for marinade and let sit overnight. 
Used sriracha instead.

This was a hit with my family. I read some of the other reviews saying that they thought it was a little bland. Since I cook for 3 hungry teenagers and a husband who like it spicy, I generally double up on all the ingredients and triple or quadruple the heat factor. I found that using 4 tablespoons of chopped chipotle peppers and it gave it just enough kick. I paired it with a good Parmesan smashed potato. Will definitely be making again.

I can build nuclear power plants, war ships and complex skyscrapers, yet my cooking skills are so that I burn ice cubes... this sweet little gem ACTUALLY was perfect for me and turned out fantastic! I let my chops marinade overnight I’m not sure if I used the right hot sauce or not (-Texas Pete) but even the kids loved it! Great recipe! Thank you!

I was amazed at how tender they were. I made them according to your recipie and drizzled the sauce on it. The  only change I made was a little. Extra hot sauce. It was perfect. So tender and tasty.

Great recipe!  I made a few adjustments as recommended by Ken’s suggestions in his feedback/ratings—increased the amount of both the Worcestershire sauce and chipotle sauce in the glaze, and added both of these ingredients to the marinade mix. Our family of 5 picky kids and my husband all said these were the absolute best pork chops they had ever had, and begged me to make them again. A definite keeper!

My finace and I loved these they where different which was good because I don't like the same old marinades. The flavor was sweet and spicy which I liked but I did not add to much hot sauce because I don't like too much spice. Also I marinated them all day more flavorful that way. Yummy

Will reduce amount of sugar, root beer has enough of it and if you blink, you're gonna have a burnt part that has to go

Make these often, (my own recipe) especially with smoked ribs. Only issue is the brine time. Whether pork chops or ribs I brine 24-48 hrs minimum. 2 hrs is not enough time for the sugars to penetrate fully. Other than that, the ingredients and instructions are good to go. Tried the recipe as per (except the brine time) and the glaze was very good.

Well I had bigger expectations for this one.  I marinated overnight and my chops were pretty plump but the end result didn't wow me and neither my husband.  I expected more tenderization from all the sugar. I'm not a chef but I feel this recipe could be further developed with a richer and thicker BBQ sauce made from the Root beer.

My rating for this is 4 stars, but when I cooked it, it came out like a 3 star taste. i think that's my fault since I used pork loin that I sliced too thickly. It had a nice flavor. Pretty sweet. I wish the reduction sauce was thicker, like a glaze.

Not bad will use again. The glaze takes a while to cook down.  So give yourself 1/2 hr to hour to cook down.  Because of time I cooked in pan not on grill .  I ended up slicing pork chops, I got real thick ones, and spooned glaze in slice marks for more flavor.

I cooked the reduction down until it was nice and sticky. After brushing it on the burnt edges from the bbq were delicious! Kids loved this one!

2 stars because they were very tender and my son loved them! Guess I'm not a fan of root beer flavored meat!

I've been trying to find a pork chop recipe that my husband will like...though I thought this recipe was decent...he didn't care for it.  More because he doesn't like pork chops than the recipe itself.

This is our favorite marinated pork chop recipe. Hubby doesn't particularly care for pork chops, but he actually requests this one. I do follow the changes suggested by the submitter to add a little extra flavor. Overall, it's a winner for us. Thanks for sharing, Ken!

My husband and I love these!  I use diet root beer as we are watching our calories.  I have made these twice in the past two weeks.  These are by far one of the best pork chop recipes I have ever tried!  Thanks for sharing!

followed other's suggestions and marinated extra time (about 8 hrs.).  Not bad, but not great either...tender, but not terribly flavorful - will not make again.

Husband and I tried this tonight. We did not care for it. Kind of tasted like marshmellows.
