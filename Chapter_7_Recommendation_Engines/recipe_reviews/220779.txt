Excellent soup after my alterations! Everyone loved it! My initial reading of this recipe alerted me that it would be a very bland tasting soup. My only alterations were that I used 2 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes, added 1 sliced celery stalk and added a large bay leaf. I also substituted the garlic powder with 4 garlic cloves that I minced and sautéed with the leeks and onions. I used 6 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and omitted the parsley. I offered crumbled cooked bacon, fresh snipped chives and prepared garlic-Parmesan croutons as options for diners to top their soup serving with. Next time, I will use individual sized shepherd loaves as serving bowls and make homemade garlic-Parmesan croutons out of the scooped bread from the shepherd loaves.

Tips:
Yukon Gold potatoes won't get mushy like russet potatoes will when boiling them. Use russet potatoes if you want a thick soup and mash them when they are tender.

Rinse the leeks in a bowl of cold water so to remove any sand, remove the leeks and wring dry in towels.

Keep the cubed potatoes in a bowl of cold water till needed.

Always turn off the heat before stirring in the cheese so that the cheese won't separate.

This is a simple, basic leek and potato soup, unencumbered by a lot of unnecessary and distracting extra ingredients.  Leeks, potatoes, chicken broth and a little milk or cream is really all you need and that’s what you get here.  Still, I wanted a more pronounced leek flavor so I doubled up on that.  While the potatoes were cooking I threw in a bay leaf and a good pinch of fresh thyme just to brighten the flavor.  I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder and skipped the parsley and cheddar cheese.  When the soup was done I pureed it in a flash with my immersion blender. A drizzle of good white truffle oil took this soup from excellent to sublime.

I used 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. bacon fat and sauted 2 cloves of garlic with 3 leeks [that's how my grocery store sells in a bunch].  Only used 4 potatoes and 4 cups of chicken stock.  PERFECT.

To all of you kind and wonderful cooks who tried this soup (which was passed on to me by my late mother-in-law), I want to thank you for taking the time to submit your comments.  It is most gratifying.  And I can't tell the editors of this marvelous cooking site how honored I was to have it posted in the last issue of the AllRecipes magazine.  Thank you all!
Happy holidays and a healthy New Year.                  From Sassa

Simple and excellent! I only made a few minor changes. I used 1.5 times the half and half and cheese, and I used the Mexican cheese blend from Costco, since that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it had the perfect texture and flavor. Very nice.

I avoid dairy so instead of the half and half i puréed a cup of Cannelli beans with a little water. Worked great, was very creamy. Also the beans added fiber and protein, rounding out the nutrition profile well.

I was actually looking for a pepper jack chicken soup, but thought this would do. Very good. I did do 1/2 cheddar 1/2 pepper jack to get the taste I was looking for. Didn't have leeks so used more onion. Four cloves fresh garlic. I threw in a half bag of frozen corn as well. Used heavy whipping cream. Loved it!

I really enjoyed this.  I does need the garlic.  Also, I used 3 leeks and added an extra potato.  I like the soup creamy, so I held off on the cheese and put it through a blender to get it nice and creamy.  Then I sprinkled the cheese on top - super!!  Might try it with some bacon next time.

Oh my this was yummy! I loved pretty much everything about it. The only thing is next time I might add a little bit of fresh garlic when the Leeks saute and I might add more leeks (i'm a leek nut). I might add a little more half and half and cheese next time. It was a little on the runnier side. Tasted amazing though!

I doubled the recipe and it was fantanstic! I cooked some bacon and had it on the side for anyone who wanted some. I tried it with and without bacon. Yum!
If you make this trust me when I say you should double it! Leftovers are the best.

Stuck to the recipe but was disappointed in the flavor. Was too mild for my tastes, although I'm sure many people love it that way.  I doctored it up some, added thyme, some seasoned salt, more black pepper, additional chicken soup base, and a light sprinkling of cayenne (not enough to make it spicy). I liked it better then, but ugh the soup broke. Obviously my fault not the recipes, I must have let it simmer too hard after adding the half-and-half. Using heavy cream makes that less likely to happen, but I should have been more watchful. I'll revisit this recipe with the added herbs and real garlic, perhaps celery.

Excellent base recipe, delicious!  I used extra leeks like other reviews suggested, 1 bay leaf as suggested, fresh garlic instead of powder, cream cheese instead of cheddar, coconut oil instead of butter, whole cream instead of half and half and lastly, just me, but I left the skins on the potatos.  I added the cream cheese after using an emerssion blender and just hand whipped it together over low heat.  I make soups all the time and husband said this is one of my best!  Fresh cracked pepper was a great garnish, I could see some fresh leek or scallion being great too.  Enjoy!

Tried this recipe yesterday & it really was good.  I used fresh garlic rather than powder & red potatoes, which I didn't peel.  It could have used a little more salt but I go light on it anyway.  Even my 17 year old who likes nothing had 2 bowls.  The only thing I may change next time is I may add bacon to it.  I think it would taste awesome!

This soup was great.  I used 8 yucon golds and 8 cups of broth, added a little salt and pureed the whole thing.  When I put it back in the pot I added the cheese.  Even better the next day.  Awesome.  Thanks Sassa!!!!!

I agreed with a few other readers that the recipe would be a bit bland. Here are my modifications I used clarified butter (ghee) instead of butter, I used red potatoes... these are small, so 3 for every one of the russets. I added whole cumin and tumeric powderto the first step.  I also added about 8 oz of finely chopped mushrooms.  

Turned out great.  I will serve it with some shredded chicken for dinner.

We loved this soup with a few minor changes!  We added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and also used the immersion blender once everything was done cooking so it was a thicker soup.  We paired it with a ciabatta grilled cheese sandwich and it was a great dinner! Perfect for colder weather! :)

Great soup with slight modifications. I sautéed leeks and onions with 4 pressed garlic cloves instead of using powder. When simmering potatoes, I added 1 large bay leaf and pepper. We didn't add any salt and instead of using "store bought", I used my homemade chicken broth. I also used an immersion blender to make it smooth. We didn't use any Cheddar cheese but we will next time when we serve it. Thank you Sassa, it's a keeper!

As written this is a solid 4 stars.  I think it does need some garlic  with the leeks, or add the garlic powder with the broth & potatoes.    Also, I would not stir the parsley into the whole pot of soup (turns it green) but just use it as a garnish.  Bacon garnish would be great.

This basically was an awesome base for me! I ended up just adding a whole lot more of everything, and added cannellini beans, and spinach (right before serving).

This soup was a huge hit at my house and is becoming a regular. I made a few changes. I used olive oil instead of butter, fresh garlic, gold potatoes instead of russet, water instead of chicken broth, added 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, left out the parsley and cheese and instead  of half and half,  I made "buttermilk" using 1 cup light coconut milk with 2 tsp apple cider vinegar. I top it with fresh thyme and olive oil and serve it with a crusty bread. Seriously amazing! Must try!

Really good. I did not have cheddar , I used grated cheese. I also did not have onions but it turned out fine. Very filling. I added some bacon and used a blender at the end. I prefer the blended texture.

Potato lover in the house loved this.  Simple and easy to prepare.  Forgot to add cheese and didn't really miss it.  Will remember next time to add it.  Did use cream instead of half and half.

Fabulous soup.  Added my own twist:  instead of butter I added olive oil, that I have bottled with spices.  Also added grated garlic and feta cheese with fresh parsley to serve.   A definite hit in my house.  My husband just had it again for lunch.  Thanks for sharing :)

This soup is just splendid.  I added extra potatoes and another leek, and it was delicious.  The leek flavor was more pronounced than I expected which paired wonderfully with the potato.  I also didn't make it entirely smooth since I like some chunks of potato.  Very comforting and simple.  So yummy!

I didn't use cheese or cream or the garlic. It was perfect. Just used a potato masher and lightly mashed right in the pot.this is a nice light supper.

Amazing! Substitutions I used was used chicken broth, cut down the salt to 1/2tsp or so and put maybe 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2. Wonderful soup--perfect started soup could eat as is or add all kinds of yummy additions. I added chicken apple sausage... THANKS! This recipe is a keeper...

I just made Winter Leek & Potato Soup for the first time ever & it is phenomenal! The only things I did different were to add only one lg. leek & I added two packets of Goya to give it a smoked ham flavor. I will be making this often!

4 stars as written. I added 1 cup chopped celery and 4 minced garlic cloves (instead of the powder) to the leak and onion mixture before cooking. Very tasty and filling!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I made some alterations, based on other reviews and also made it vegetarian.  I added one extra leek, sauteed one chopped stalk of celery, one bay leaf & 4 cloves minced garlic with the onion mixture (instead of adding the garlic powder later), and substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  I crock potted the potatoes beforehand and reduced the simmering time for the cooked potatoes with the vegetable broth and onion mixture to 10 min to let the flavors combine.  I did not add the cheese to the soup so that it could be optional, but for my bowl, I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese and garlic croutons as a garnish.  Very hearty and warm for a winter's night!

I like it. I had leftover leeks in the fridge that needed to be used up right away so this was good. The only thing I did different was that I mashed up the potatoes as it got softer in the pot and since I didn't have half&half, I used milk and 1-2 Tbs. of flour and simmered until it got really thick. I also added some sliced mushrooms as well and only sprinkled a handful of cheese on top. Overall, it turned out great! I ate it with plain bread. Thanks; now I know how to make leek and potato soup. =)

Super easy and very delicious. I added a bay leaf, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, omitted the parsley, added a celery stalk and used 3 leeks as that's what I had and I didn't want to waste the 3rd in case I didn't get around to making more soup. I didn't have to add any salt at all as there was more than enough salt from adding the chicken stock. Great recipe! I look forward to making it again :)

This was very, very good. I used four cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder and whole milk instead of half and half. Because this made it a little thinner, I added some water with one tablespoon of corn starch just to make it a little less runny. The flavor turned out deliciously mild. I loved the addition of cheese--just enough to add to the flavor without making it a cheese soup.

Really good soup for a cold night.  When it was done cooking, I used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup so it was a smooth, thick consistency.  I still left some potato chunks to enjoy as well.  Served with sandwiches for a quick and easy weeknight dinner.

I made this recipe pretty much as is without adding the cheddar cheese and since I did not have half and half I had to make it myself with 1/3 whole milk and 1/3 heavy whipping cream. Whit that said, this soup is restaurant quality! Hands down. I will make it again. My only suggestion is to add chives instead of parsley. Once I blended it with a hand blender, I noticed it begged for chives! It is creamy and velvety! I had a small piece of celery which I chopped and added. I personally think the cheddar is unnecessary it could cover the flavor of the leeks.

Since leeks are sold by 3 at my store, I used 3 leeks.  Perfect application for the immersion blender to create a nice smooth soup.  Follow recipe as is for a simply delicous soup or take it up a notch with thinly sliced green onions as a garnish and drizzle with white truffle il as suggested by another reviewer.

I did make some alterations by collaborating various people’s modifications. The spices I used were thyme, parsley and cayenne. I added celery and ham as well. Rather than garlic powder, I used minced garlic. When the potato’s were soft enough, I mashed them in the pot to purée them a little. I would recommend puréeing it in a food processor once the potato’s are soft enough to break it down further. I only used 900ml of chicken stock (that’s the format it came in) which I think helped with the thickness. I would definitely make this again!!

I added celery and used minced garlic in place of the garlic powder.  I left out the cheese to save calories.  This is as close to the soup we loved in Wales as I can find and it will be a frequent meal in our home!

Delicioso! Everyone who's tried this has raved about it. Only changed powdered garlic for fresh and used enough broth to cover the spuds which was more than stated, then used a submersible blender to make into a creamy soup. So simple you won't be disappointed. Crispy bacon bits and sour cream could make a nice topping also. Props to the poster of the recipe!

I followed a couple tweaks from the comments and it turned out amazing! I added a dash of cayenne pepper and made bacon to sprinkle on top.  Family loved it and it impressed my mom who has a long tradition of making this soup. When serving, I added a splash of cream, fresh crumbled bacon, and chopped green onion. Yum!

The recipe doesn't mention to puree it even though the photo looks like it was pureed. Pureed was better even though we tried it both ways.

Loved it. Added a stalk of chopped celery, pinch of cayenne pepper, pinch of thyme and when emulsified with hand blender when potatoes ready.  I put the remainder of herbal cream cheese spread into it then grated a hunk of Monterey Jack cheese and lastly 10% coffee cream about half a cup. A bit of fresh chopped parsley....fabulous. The pinch of cayenne pepper lends just a pinch of  heat but not spicey.  Will make this recipe again and just add whatever is left over in the fridge.

Great soup.  I smashed it up with a hand blender at the end to make it creamy, it would have a weird consistency otherwise.

Lovely soup... didn't have half n half so used half full cream, half milk... delicious. I used the hand blender to smooth before I added cream, just be careful if you do, it can turn a bit gluey, don't over blend... excellent soup though, thanks Sassa :)

Instead of half n half I used heavy whipping cream, yes 1 whole cup! Plus I added celery and completely smoothed my soup with an immersion blender plus I added 1 bay leaf and let it simmer for about 1/2 hour.

Very good and simple. I made a few changes just for my personal sense of taste. I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and used a cup of chopped celery and added a cup of bacon. I used three garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder. I used three leeks rather than two. I had some french bread to go along with it and it was amazing :)

I added 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream and 1/2 the cream called for in the recipe. Gave the soup a nice tang. And less calories , too. Sprinkled some dill on top before serving.

Very nice soup! I was of two minds as to whether to puree it or not, but choose not to and the extra texture was good. It made more than the 6 servings advertised.

Next time I will blend the veg before so that the soup will be smooth
And add none or way less hard cheese it made it a little too heavy though I usually like fat.. ??

I plan on making this again. It was delectable. I use an immersion blender and I can control how smooth or chunky I want the soup. 

I saved the dark green leafy parts of the leeks and carefully cleaned them. I added them to some other vegetable peels I had, and made the most delicious vegetable broth.

This is fantastic! I also used fresh minced garlic, a bit of cayenne pepper, no bay leaf, and used immersion blender a little leaving some potato chunks. Stirred cheddar cheese into individual bowls and crumbled bacon atop homemade croutons! YUM! It's a keeper!!

I will most likely make this again. It is a nice soup to have on a cold winter day.

It seemed like the soup would be a bit bland if you follow the recipe exactly, so I added 2 bay leaves and a thyme sprig to give it some extra flavor as it cooked. In addition, I added about a third of a cup more cheddar cheese than the recipe instructed which was a very nice touch, giving the soup a richer flavor. Last, I replaced the garlic powder with fresh minced garlic which I felt would give it a better garlic flavor.

My first dish of the new year - and it was great!  My wife and I both loved it.  Left out the cheddar cheese and added fresh parsley and salt and pepper.  Preparation was easy and from start to finish only took about 1 1/2 hours.  I'll be making this again soon.  Perfect warm up for our freezing cold weather.

I made this soup again on 1/30/18.  It was really great.  I added the cheddar cheese which made the soup even better.  Just a little bit creamy with more taste.  This soup is definitely a family favorite.

Kept it vegetarian by using veggie broth. Excellent soup! Reminds me of a delicious soup I had once in a NYC Irish pub (boy, did I miss that, and this is the perfect copycat recipe)! Thanks for submitting it. Will make often.

A good, simple to make potato soup. I used some turkey stock made from our Thanksgiving turkey, which was a much richer and flavorful stock than packaged chicken broth. I noticed that there are a lot of mentions of the soup being too bland, and I think my stock was the reason it was not. My other change was that I ran the immersion blender in the soup for a bit to puree part of the potatoes and leeks, as I like it thicker, but still left plenty of chunks. Very good and I'll make this again with leftover holiday turkey stock!

The soup looked and smelled delicious, but unfortunately I had added a bay leaf, which I forgot to remove before I used the immersion blender. there were little chips of sharp bay leaf in the soup. I decided to throw it out rather than risk a GI bleed. At least I hadn't added the cream yet. I will make it again. I have tossed my bay leaves

I added fresh garlic to the leeks and onions. I thought it still was a little bland so I added more pepper and garlic powder. Next time I am going to add either bacon bits or chopped ham to the mix. It was a easy good recipe to make and you can make it your own easily.

It turned out great as it is. A keeper

Just finished a bowl of this tasty soup. I made just a few minor changes. I used milk instead of half and half because I didn’t have any. I also used fresh garlic and sautéed them with the leeks. I also had on hand some freshly roasted peppers so I used one. It added a nice little kick to the soup. I didn’t have fresh parsley or cheese so I skipped those. I mashed up the potatoes to make it a bit creamier.

It is completely bland w/ just S&P to taste. Roasted a Poblano as well as adding Cayenne. More black pepper, some seasoning salt. A little extra Cheddar plus a bit of leftover Velveeta. A couple bay leaves and fresh garlic...plus garlic granules. It's serviceable now.

When ever I make a nice Corned Beef and Cabbage I make sure to have about 6 cooked and quartered potatoes and 1 or more cups of Corned Beef broth and some small cooked carrots left over or on hand..  All I really need now are:  3 narrow LEEKS; Some 1/2 and 1/2; a little Chadonnay..Parsley; Shredded Sharp White Cheddar;  Some  Garlic ;                                                              Tip: a few Coriander seeds, and pinch of finely diced sweet red pepper. A few Capers as well as Little morsels of Fatty Corned Beef w/ a few Coriander seeds also enhances the Leek saute'- voila!

I took the advice of some of the reviews to add some extra ingredients. I added two chopped garlic cloves cooked with the leeks and onions.  I simmered with a bay leaf.  I garnished with crumbled bacon and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.
Everything else was done the same as the recipe. It was absolutely delicious!

I modified it by mashing the potatoes before adding to the soup and it is amazing! Creamy, without the cream soup base.
We have also crumbled bacon into the soup, and I can safely say it is good both ways!

Great winter soup. Easy and low cost to make but a heart dish that the whole family loved. I used more leeks, potatoes, and fresh garlic than the recipe called for and really liked the modification.

I only had one leek so I cut the recipe in half. I made the potato pieces too big so I used a blender to make it smoother. I put the cheese in the individual bowls or the whole pot would probably get a skin on it. I like it. My husband is more of a stew person so the bigger pieces would've been nice for him but chances are I'll eat most of it myself for lunch for the next few days

An excellent version of a soup I've loved for decades. I did not choose to purée the soup - served it as is after following the recipe as written. This recipe is simple enough that I was able to whip it up on the side while preparing a separate meal in the same working space. This is a fantastic soup - loved by adults and children alike!

We liked this soup a lot.  After reading some of the other reviews, I made a couple of minor changes.  I pureed the soup with an immersion blender once the potatoes were cooked.   Then, I didn't add cream and cheddar cheese but replaced both with Boursin cheese.  It was really yummy!

Wonderful soup.  I added a bay leaf, carrots, mushrooms, and celery, including the baby leaves  I just had braces and what I can eat is limited.  I forgot to add some garlic powder.  Just added and it's good.  Also added a tiny bit of Hormel bacon pieces.  This soup is delicious!!!

This is the perfect side soup to any dish. I altered the soup a bit upon reading the recipe and reviews of this having a bland flavor. I omitted the parsley and used fresh oregano and thyme. I added the fresh herbs while the soup was simmering during step 3. I did not add the garlic salt, but instead I used fresh garlic in step 1 and added salt and pepper to taste in step 3. I also used a immersion hand blender to smooth out the soup before adding the half and half. With those alterations, the soup was smooth, creamy, and very flavorful.

Great soup!   Definitely needed the seasoning and the cheese though.   Very filling, enough so for my hungry kids to have for their dinner with a wholemeal roll.  Will definitely be making this again.

We love this soup! Only change we made was to use Swiss cheese instead of cheddar because we love Swiss cheese.

So good!  Two changes I made - didn't have half and half, so I used a can of evaporated milk (I made a 1.5 batch, so this was the perfect amount) and I added a half a pound of soft cooked bacon.  This was easy and delicious, and I will definitely be making it again!

I've made this 3 or 4 times now and everyone loves it.  These are the changes I've made -- like Dale I prefer using fresh garlic and sauté it with the onions and leeks. I use bacon renderings rather than butter to saute the vegetables.  I also used 3 leeks rather than 2 because they are usually packaged that way. I add a celery stalk and bay leaf with the potatoes and stock and remove them before blending the soup to a velvety texture with my immersion blender.   We like to use gruyere cheese instead of cheddar for a more subtle taste and add it over the soup in the bowls.  We haven't bothered with the parsley because we don't have it on hand in the winter. Bacon pieces are nice with the cheese spread over the soup before serving.  ( BTW, one box of broth equals 4 cups of broth)

First, let me say this is an excellent soup, and tastes amazing. Even with all the onions and leeks, the soup doesn't have an overly onion taste. The pepper gives it a nice spice.

I used a "smart stick" to blend the soup a bit after the ingredients had cooked. And although I really liked the flavor "as is", I did add some bacon.

I'd never made anything with leeks before, so this was interesting.  And it turned out really well!  I did take suggestions for changes from other reviews though.

I used a 3 lb bag of Yukon Gold baby potatoes, 3 leeks, a medium yellow onion, 5 cups of broth, 3 minced cloves of garlic (instead of garlic powder), a bay leaf, and a stalk of celery.

I will definitely be making this again!

This isn't my 1st time making leek and potato soup. I know that  leeks have very mild flavor. Adding too much potatoes, herbs or even cheese will completely cover their flavor. So I chose to omit the parsley and the cheese. The 6 potatoes stated in here isn't a clear amount. A potato can be the size of a walnut or a foot ball.. I used 4 medium russet potatoes, totaling about 1 and 1/2 pound. I pureed half the soup and left the rest chunky. Husband and kids loved it.

I substituted two fine herbes bouillon cubes and water for the chicken broth, and I pureed it all before adding the cream, and really, the cream wasn't necessary - it would be easy to vegan-ize the recipe. Everyone ate it, even the kids, and it really was delicious. Made with the last of my  CSA leeks.

I have made this recipe twice now.  I followed the recipe with these exceptions:  I used 3 strips turkey bacon, chopped and cook with the vegetables . I added 1 cup celery chopped, 1 teaspoon minced garlic.  I served without the cheddar cheese - I saw no reason to mess with perfection.  The second time I used heavy cream instead of half and half because I was looking for a very rich soup.  Both times it was wonderful and received complements from all family and guests. A friend made this, and although  I am not sure what she did,  it was far too thin, so we added some instant mashed potatoes for a quick fix.  Even that was great!  Hope you enjoy this as much as we did.  Also., from start to finish, including prepping the food for soup, it is about 45-60 minutes to dinner with a completely set table.

I went by the recipe mostly. It was a little on the bland side, but overall really good! Next time I will try adding a little bit of cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce to taste. I didn't have bacon, but I did have a 1/4 inch ham steak, which I diced up and fried before adding to the soup. Delicious!

Delicious!  And I loved the fact that this recipe was much lower in fat content and calories than many of the other potato leek soup recipes.  You could make it even lower in fat by subbing fat-free half and half.  The only changes I made were to add an additional leek, and use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Great recipe, and even better the second day!

I switched to 4 minced cloves of garlic which was sautéed with the leeks and onions.  I also added  carrot for more nutritional value.  Switched up the half and half for milk.

This is a great starting recipe and you can add or subtract to taste.

I made this twice in the last month. It's a simple soup. My slight changes: I use vegetable broth instead of chicken, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder (sauted with the onion and leeks), and cheese on top before serving instead of stirred in.

Some tips: I slice the potatoes thinly instead of cubing them--they cook faster that way and it is easier to mash them in the pot. I mash them roughly before adding the cream. The soup ends up with a lumpy, rustic consistency. So comforting on a cold day!

This soup was excellent.  We puréed 3/4 of it at the end.  And we used Kraft Habanero Heat shredded cheese and light (5%) cream  And I added a bit of chopped garlic to the leeks and onions.  With a ciabatta roll and a salad, it was a fantastic meal.

I made this just tonight. I did one thing different, otherwise followed as written. I dredged some thinly sliced scallions in some flour and sautéed them in olive oil till crispy. I then used those for a topping when serving. Everyone here loved this hearty soup. I might add some carrots and/or corn next time. Even some pieces of chicken might be good. You could pump this up to be a chowder, more than a soup. Excellent recipe.

I've never ate or used leeks before, but I received some in my CSA box last week. Easy recipe. I made a few seasoning changes and didn't have cream (whole milk & butter). Even my husband enjoyed it.

Wonderful soup! I made it exactly like the recipe and my family loved it. I also love the fact it's on the table in just an hour.

I made this recipe when I saw it in allrecipe magazine. I made it exactly the way the recipe said except for using 8 ounces of cheddar and a little heartier amount of parsley and garlic powder. It wasn't super flavorful and the potatoes got kind of mushy (hence only four stars), but it did taste good and my husband really liked it, especially since I crumbled some bacon on top to give it a little more flavor and texture. Will probably make again.

I use extra broth (Knorr Vegetable stock mix) and no half and half.  I also use real garlic rather than powder.  I then use a hand blender to make it creamy.  Most people think it is so creamy that there must be cream in it.  This is my standard soup.  I grow leeks and cut them up in the fall in measured quantities and freeze so that I can quickly make up a batch of soup.

This recipe has a good base; leeks, potatoes & onions. There is absolutely no need for butter, cream or salt. All you need is a soup pot or a slow cooker; add leeks, potatoes, garlic, pepper, vegetable or chicken broth, nutmeg, ground gloves and 4 pears (peeled). Let it cook until the potatoes are soft, take a hand held blender & blend until smooth. No added fat or salt - lets face it we do not need it!

This is my favorite potato soup recipe because it is easy. I used a whole onion since I didn't have leeks. Used jack cheese because that is what was on hand. Fabulous soup. Served with hard rolls. Can't be beat. Throw some bacon bits in it and voila...heaven.

Kids loved it. I did all the modifications suggested in the first review, and my kids gave it a 9 out of 10. It doesn't get much better than that for kids and vegetables. Oh, and I only used skimmed milk instead of Half and Half,  and extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I love it.

This soup was wonderful.  I didn't measure anything so I am unable to comment on the proportions.  I did add a little bit of dill and next time I think I will have to take some other suggestions and add some bacon.

Very "comforting" - plus, not fussy: adjust quantities if desired and season to taste.

Pretty yummy. I'm interested in adding real bacon bits as a garnish at the end.

I’m a big fan of potato leek soup.  This was good, but did not have the deep robust leek flavor that I look for in a leek soup.

Great! Simple, easy and much more delicious than one might think. Added ham, and almost forgot the salt, pepper and garlic powder because it tasted so good without them!!!!
