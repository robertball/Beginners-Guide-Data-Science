Oh my goodness, this is incredible! Super easy and quick to make, and delicious! The only changes I made was using penne pasta instead of bow tie, 5 ounces of pesto instead of 7, and a blend of parmesan and romano cheese. Also, I'd say it makes more like 6 servings, not 4.

Fantastic and super easy! I used homemade pesto, vegetable broth, whole grain pasta, small white beans, and fresh tomatoes. Served it with garlic bread and a salad. It was so good I ate leftovers for breakfast!:) I'm sure I'll be making this again soon.

I have now made this recipe several times, and it is mighty good!  The first time, i followed the recipe and it was yummy, but it definitely needed more stuff in it.  Now, i double the fresh tomatoes and the cannelini beans and it's perfect!  thanks so much!

I really liked this.  I didn't find it all that salty, but they do make low sodium broth that you could substitute for the bullion and water.  The frest tomatoes really made the dish though.  It was great =)

I won't be making this one again.  This was extremely salty and I just didn't find it that appealing.

I used this as a great base recipe.  First, since others thought this was too salty, I halved the bullion (1 cube instead of 2).  I also used penne because I didn't have bowtie.  Then, I added some sauteed onion, garlic, mushroom, and spinach.  This made for an awesome presentation and was so yummy with the extra toppings!

I make this every time my pesto-hating husband is out of town! Usually substitute jarred sun-dried tomatoes and add some cut up rotisserie chicken to the mix. Last time I tried to use sun-dried tomatoes from a bag and it did not taste as good.
