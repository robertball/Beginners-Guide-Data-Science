Just what you need for a cold night! Warm, hearty.  One change - I did not put it in the blender - I kept it as a chunky stew.  Fabulous!  Made the work easier too.   I made it a week ago and we are still eating the leftovers.  And I don't eat leftovers - so that should say something!

This was absolutely delicous!  It was comfot food and I felt so good about eating it, knowing how healthy it was!  

I substituted corn oil, 1 large onion, 2 real tomatoes diced, chicken stock, cooking wine, 1/4 bunch of cilantro.

I also omitted the parsnip because they dont have them at the supermarket.  

Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out so great.  I served half as a soup (using most of the liquid).  And the next day I served it with    brown rice like rice-and-beans.  

Any vegetarian will be like "yumskers!"

Excellent soup for those chilly nights. This soup has a wonderful flavor and is easy to make. My only change was that I increased the amounts of vegetable stock, wine, and Worcestershire as the lentils soaked up a lot of the broth.

awesome soup.  i added 4 cups of vegetable stock instead of 3, salt, pepper, cumin, mustard seed, vinegar and tabasco.  i also pureed about half of the recipe to make the soup thicker.  amazing.

The recipe doesn't call for enough broth for the amount of lentils it tells you to use. I had to keep adding broth and water. but it's yummy!

Great recipe. I didn't add the wine and I didn't miss it. I substituted an onion for the leek and though I'm sure it would have been even more flavorful with the leek it was fine as it was. The root vegetables gave it a delicious taste. I pureed half of the soup for a semi-chunky consistancy.

This is a fantastic base recipe to create many flavours off of.  I used parsnips, potatoes, carrots, onions and green beans to create a hearty soup.  I found that I needed to add lots of herbs and spices to really get flavour out of the broth.  I definately recommend this recipe.

A very hearty soup.  The recipe made more than the 4 servings listed.  Had to substitute cooking sherry for the red wine.  Will make this one again.

This soup was very good.  I enjoyed its complex nature.  The cilantro added a lovely pungency which cleared my sinuses (added bonus). ;)

I used Columbia Winery Merlot for the wine.  I also added crimini mushrooms towards the end and a cumin/curry powder combo as one reviewer suggested.  Good stuff!

Add tomatoes AFTER the lentil are cooked, otherwise it is possible the lentils will not soften no matter how long you cook them for. Great hearty soup - and I agree, add more stock. Enjoy!

This was only okay until we added lots of black pepper to our bowls. DEFINITELY add a lot of black pepper to this. I also think it would be better with Italian-style stewed tomatoes and not regular ones, and that would give it a lot of flavor. As would topping it with Parmesan.

This is VERY good.  My husband looked rather underwhelmed when I handed him his bowl, but he happily announced that it was not only good but better than it looked.  (funny man!)  The changes I made:  olive oil, 2 carrots, no parsnip, 3 potatoes, not peeled, no worcestershire sauce, no wine, forgot the cilantro, and used fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic, added some pan-fried chicken and apple sausage and used chicken stock rather than vegie stock.  Very good flavor - no need for salt.

GREAT lentil soup recipe! I took the advice of past reviews and added salt and lots of pepper, some granulated garlic and oregano just to get a bit more flavor into it. The leftovers are delicious too! Definitely making this again and again.

Oh. My. Gosh. This was so good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the cilantro because I can't stand the stuff. Added frozen carrots and peas at the end of cooking, too. The flavor was just incredible! And so filling, too! :D I'll definitely be making more of this in the future.

This soup was warm and filling! The lentils had to be cooked an extra 15 minutes longer because they were not quite done in the time range it stated. Pepper.. I added a lot of black pepper and some salt. I think next time I'll add extra veggies.

I made this soup but added a pound of cut up smoked sausage and there was nothing left of the batch.  I will make this on a regular basis because it is easy and so good.  All you need to add is rolls or biscuits for the perfect meal.

Great taste. It's really more of a stew than a soup (and we added an extra cup of stock and extra water). In one bowl I added balsamic vinegar and in another added tabasco. Both were great. I highly recommend.

Due to the fact that I live in the middle of nowhere, I didn't use a parsnip, but didn't feel like it took away from the soup.  Still absolutely delicuous, the worcestershire, red wine, and soy sauce really added that extra flavor that I am always looking for in my lentil soups.

Absolutely wonderful!  The only changes I made were to add more potatoes and carrots, as well as some curry and cumin.  Delicious!  I made this only a few days ago, intentionally doubled the recipe to freeze a bunch... it's already been thawed and eaten. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup last night! It was soo delicious!! We've never cooked with leeks or parnsips before but the smell was so intoxicating we favored it before we even tried it! The only thing we didn't add was the celery( a great dislike by the bf)  or the wine, we where shopping on a budget but it tasted very good! Thanks for the recipe!

very, very good!  We're not vegetarian, so I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth. I chopped up all the veggies and then saute'd them in batches (all at once would crowd the pan) so they'd brown nicely before dumping them in the pot with lentils & liquids. I also added the green onions at the very end so they wouldn't loose all their flavor, and didn't use cilantro because we don't care for it much.  Also added extra liquid- a splash more wine, at least a cup extra of broth...  very, very good soup.  Topped it off with fresh cracked pepper and shredded parmesan cheese.

This was a good soup. We did not have all of the ingredients so substituted a little. I used chicken broth and added extra liquid as the other reviews suggested.  I did not puree it and left is as a stew. I will make it again.

This was delicious. I didn't have a parsnip or leak on hand. I substituted fresh parsley for cilantro because my husband hates cilantro. I also left out the wine and added an extra cup of vegetable broth like other reviewers suggested. I think this would be good any way you make it!

I thought overall it was pretty good.  I made a few adjustments though.  I couldn't find parsnip at my local grocery store, i had two medium potatos, no soy sauce, no red wine (b/c i forgot), but i added extra tobasco sause.  This was not very soup-like,  i think i was expecting it to be more watery.  a great overall taste though.

Excellent!  I didn't have red wine, so left that out, but it still tastes great.

Excellent fall/winter soup. Hearty, flavorful, filling. Lasted my man & I 3+ nights. I did toss after 3rd night only because it had been re-heated so many times it was looking a little sad. Highly recommend. My only change was 1 regular onion in place of green onions (& no cilantro). Will definitely need additional salt & pepper to taste. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I made this first as indicated in the posted recipe and thought it was good, but I didn't love it.  I didn't care for the broth and thought the spices needed a little tweak.  So I made it again, but this time, I sautéed one white onion (no leeks or  green onion used), and then added 1/2 tsp of both cumin and coriander to the onion in the pan.  I didn't use the red wine, but instead increased the chicken broth by an extra 1/2 cup to ensure the amount of liquid was the same as the original recipe.  With these changes, I thought it was fantastic.  Thanks for the kick start on this great vegetarian soup.

This was REALLY delicious.  But, you absolutely need more broth, even if you like it chunky (which I do!).  I had doubled the recipe and ended up adding 2-3 cups more of vegetable broth.  Didn't change anything else.

Orignally, I was going to give this four stars based on my first bowl. Even the second wasn't bad, but the thing started to become something other than soup, more like a stew. By the third bowl, it was a gloppy unappetizing mess.  I guess the lentils absorbed all the water. There are better soups out there. I'll try those.

Kind of bland. Needs salt. I added a little cumin and a little curry powder and it tasted great after that. Also, I added kernel corn and cut green beans. Very filling.

My wife said she wanted a hearty soup tonight, giving me short notice.  Finding this recipe on the site made the evening for us.   Since 'hearty' for me means meat, I cooked some sweet Italian turkey sausage on the side and dumped it in for about the last 10 min. There are myriad ways of successfully altering this recipe, and always coming out on top, I would suspect.  Thanks.

Excellent!  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  I also used red lentils since that is what I had on hand, and it was perfect.  My husband loved it, too.  Thanks!

I love lentils and this soup is delicious, my roomate wasn't as pleased though he thought that it should only be a 3, he must not love lentils.  Oh, yea, I cooked the veggies down with a half stick a butter with the vegetable oil.

Once the soup was done I took a cup out, blended and added back to the pot for a creamy texture and
I made chips by baking whole grain tortilla wedges as a side. 
Absolutely filling and delicious.

Very good! Lentils took longer to soften. I simmered for about an hour. As a result I had to add more liquid - about a cup more broth. Felt it needed a bit more flavor so I added salt and a tsp of cumin. Almost as an afterthought I stirred in a half can of coconut cream that I had on hand. This turned out to be just the right amount of extra liquid plus a note of richness.

I didn't have a leek, but I had a shallot that needed used. I used 4 cups of low sodium broth and could have used more, it took almost an hour for my lentils to cook. My hub doesn't like tomatoes, but I subbed a 10 oz can of salt free Rotel, after the lentils cooked, it kind of over took the flavor. I don't like cilantro, but he does, so I only added 1/2 a bunch, it made a huge difference, well worth it. over all a good chunky meatless stew

I doubled it -- used half veggie and half chicken broth.  Topping each bowl with a splash or two of balsamic vinegar and the chopped fresh cilantro elevated the dish immensely.   All of the Middle-Eastern lentil recipes add lemon at the end so I'm assuming that there is a good reason to include a comparable  "acid"  when serving.  Also tried it with some parmesan on top -- yummy.  (FYI -   added 2 more cups of broth for the double recipe) -- the seasonings need to be beefed up if you add that much.   I used RED lentils and they cooked in less than 20 minutes! (Also, I added the tomatoes after the lentils cooked as per another review.)    No parsnips.  Added garlic powder, extra wine (couldn't tell -- may be more noticeable when less broth is used).  I plan on making this again.  It was 90 degrees out (had the AC going) and we gobbled it down anyway.

It was pretty good... only added a few herbs and cooked for longer than it called for - 45 minutes (used Mung beans) so might be the reason.  Otherwise my partner and I enjoyed it!

This soup is awesome!  I also use it as a base for lentil shepherd's pie, just add less liquid.  My family didn't believe there was no meat in it!  I think when I make either of them I add more red wine than it calls for and I'm pretty liberal with seasoning.  Definitely recommend trying this and adding your own spin!

I love homemade soup and this one is a keeper! It's full of good for you ingrediants, low fat, high fiber and high flavor. 
My son's girlfriend and I love lentils, but no one else will eat them. So with Nikki was coming over, I made this just for the two of us. 
I left off the onions (allergy) the leek (didn't have any)
and used Italian diced tomatoes and Bragg's Amino Acids instead of the woy and worchestshire sauce. Then like the other reviewer, I used my immersion blender for half of the soup before serving so that it was a more blended consistency.  Thanks for sharing!

I used what veggies I had on hand, which differed a bit from the recipe.  I pureed about 1/2 of it and left 1/2 chunky.  Very good.  Perfect for a cold day.  I will make this again.
