Is baking soda missing from the recipe?  Just took out of the oven and they look kind of heavy and dense.

Did not turn out well at all. Bland - seemed to be missing ingredients and did not bake up well. I added vanilla to the frosting and it was better then. Would not make again.

This was amazing- I was very impressed with the moist taste and the cream cheese frosting was a great addition. I always have extra bananas with no idea how to use them and with this recipe, I have found a great use for them.

I just made this. I added 1 tsp Vanilla & 1/2 tsp baking powder. I didn't bother with the frosting, but I found that the cake/bars didn't need the extra sweetness. I drizzled melted hazelnut chocolate over pieces for my husband when I served him some.

Please do not  make this without  any baking power (which was left out of the recipe) you know why I know I ready it 5 times to make sure it did not have any in the recipe, but wasn't smart enough to follow my instinct

This recipe worked great! I followed other users advice and added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. It came out more like a cake than bars, but that was OK. I did not have all the ingredients for the frosting, so I made up a crunchy struesel with panko crumbs, butter, maple syrup and a touch of molasses, sprinkled it on top before baking, and it came out fabulous!

I made exactly per the recipe except I added 1/2 t baking soda.  I can't imagine baking a sweet treat with either baking soda or powder.  I think the end product would have benefited from vanilla extract.  I think they are good but not especially flavorful and I used really ripe bananas.  Thanks!
