I made this according to the recipe, in spite of the facts that I'm not a mint fan and the "Boss" (read  "wife") is not a big fan of lime juice. But we both liked this. We're what I call "heater eaters" so I was  more than liberal with the peppers.  A big THANK YOU,  moosie, for a solid repeater recipe.

I was pleasntly surprised with this recipe.  The mint and the basil really go well together and it's a good way to use up a bunch of stuff from the garden.  It has a very unusual flavor that your guests will love and remember.

This was excellent.  I drained a can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles and used that in place of the tomatoes and peppers.  No reason you can't make this all year.  Served it for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe!

Made this for a summer beach party of about 50 people.  I brought it with tortillas cut up, brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with kosher salt and broiled.  Of all the appetizers that were brought, this was the favorite!

This was great!  I was looking for a new dip to try with my guac, and this was so refreshing.  I wasn't sure how the mint would do in it - but it actually complimented the heat of the peppers quite nice!

This was a nice different "dip" that worked well for our dairy free friends!  I followed the advice of a prior reviewer and subbed a can of Rotel for the tomato/chillies with great success.  THANKS for the recipe!

It could be I butchered this recipe with my changes, but it came out really bitter for me.

I had a mix of mint leaves (previously frozen) and dried mint for the fresh mint, and the same mix of frozen leaves and dried basil.

I substituted jalapenos for the Thai chilis. 

I think the mint is probably what made it bitter so would probably try reducing the amount if I made it again.

This always gets rave reviews, and I don't put in half the stuff it calls for since I never have cucumber or Thai peppers and I pull a lemon off the tree to substitute for the lime juice. I put in a little bit of red pepper flake for the zing to replace the Thai peppers.
