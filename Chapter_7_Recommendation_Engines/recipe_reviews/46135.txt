It was a little bland, but it was a good addition to Carmelized Onion Pork Tenderloin.  I added a little brown sugar to sweeten it up.  If you can, be sure to use sweet onions in this recipe.

For those of you wondering where the sour cream is, it isn't an actual ingredient, its the flavor that comes from the buttermilk.  It tastes like sour cream.  Its basically a sour and creamy gravy with onion.

It was okay, but I made again and subbed the oil with butter, and the water with chicken broth, and I had a five star gravy!

I'm in the same boat as pinpin - where's the sour cream?  Is it just a typo?  Please clarify.

I really enjoyed this gravy.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 milk and 1/4 cup sourcream.  I used it over grilled chicken and for beakfast the next morning I ate it over my eggs and sausage.  YUM!

I was hoping for a little more flavour from this. Also I found the directions a bit confusing where it says add the oil and then later says add the remaining oil. I used all the oil to fry the onions and then added the flour straight in without removing the onions. Then I let it go on a very low heat for 15 minutes before adding the buttermilk and water. I think a few changes might give me what I was hoping for. I'm planning to try this again and use butter instead of oil and add in some garlic and onion powders. Thanks for letting me try.

According to the name of the recipe and the description, it seems to me that there should be sour cream somewhere in the ingredients.  But I don't see it mentioned anywhere.  What am I missing??

I modified this recipe to use for an impromptu dinner.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and not having any buttermilk on hand I mixed 1/4 cup plain yogurt with 1/2 cup soy milk.  In addition to salt and pepper, I added garlic salt and paprika.  Delicious!

With the following changes, this made a nice gravy: Used butter, not oil, a (half of a large) Vidalia onion,  mostly seasoned flour (leftover from breading chicken) for more flavor, chicken broth, not water, and added a little honey while cooking the onions.  A nice, creamy, very onion-y gravy.

I really wanted to like this.  I'm not sure what I didn't like about it, maybe it was the taste of the buttermilk.  I may try it again with regular milk.

Not the kind of gravy I'd eat with a spoon, but was good served over basmati rice.

It was really good!  I doubled the recipe but only added the assigned 1/3 cup of water because I like my gravy thick.  Adding a lot of ground pepper helps bring out the flavors, I find.
