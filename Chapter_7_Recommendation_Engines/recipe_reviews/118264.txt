These turned out rather crumbly for me as others have said.  They were still pretty tasty if you don't have graham crackers, but some of the other s'more bars reipes are better that have them.

I made this recipe as directed except that I used old fashioned oats,tossed in a Tb of wheat germ and used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. I was hoping it would be more cake-bar, but it was more of a crumbly crust. Certainly not something I could imagine eating in the car...I would have it everywhere! Over all it was tasty and easy, even though it wasn't the recipe I was looking for. I found that chilling the bars made them much easier to cut.
I'm sure my kids will love them.

This recipe is delicious! I found the crust a little too sweet for my taste, but my boyfriend really liked it, I will definately make again, but I'll cut the amount of sugar for the crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We made this for the first time this morning, doubled the crust & froze it as suggested by others.  This is a wonderful dessert.  My 7 y/o made it this morning & He won 2nd place in his age group at our Church bake off.

They satisfied my s'mores craving, but I found them to be a bit heavy on the margarine.

These rock!  I never re-make desserts/cookies...I'm always up for trying something new...but I tell you, these will definately be made again at our house.  So easy, my 6 & 8 year old could almost make them alone!

Delicious!!! Followed recipe and they turned out delicious.  Rave reviews from all who tried them.  Looking forward to trying this with variations(coconut peanut butter chips, or walnuts).  It may also be cute/ less messy if put in individual servings (paper cupcake holders).
