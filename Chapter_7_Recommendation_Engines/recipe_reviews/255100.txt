Shockingly easy.  I made with saut√©ed sugar snap peas, red peppers, cherry tomatoes, and spicy sausage.  Froze the excess gnocchi.

I have always made gnocchi by baking the potatoes first. I'd remove them from the oven and immediately cut in half lengthwise to allow the steam to escape. When ready to handle, I'd then scoop out the insides and spread on the counter to allow more moisture to escape. This recipe worried me a bit given it directs boiling the potatoes. After they were ready, I placed the whole potatoes on a cutting board, and once cool enough to touch, I used my vegetable peeler to remove all the skins, then cut in half as usual and allowed them to release steam. I don't have a ricer, so I used a large grater to grate the potatoes directly onto my counter top. Because I was having friends for dinner who are GF, I used gluten free flour as a one-for-one replacement in this recipe. Doing so meant I had to continue to add more GF flour and potato starch to help the dough become more dry and tacky. Also used one egg and one egg yolk, mixed together, to try to cut down on the wetness of an additional egg white. Everything mixed very well together and from there, the directions are perfect. When I pan-seared the gnocchi after boiling, I used a small amount of olive oil in which I warmed fresh thyme to help release the herb's flavor. I also added some slices of bacon  before tossing in the gnocchi. It was PERFECT. To get the ridges on the gnocchi, after cutting the dough into 1" squares, roll each piece against the backside of a fork's tines. This is a time-consuming recipe, but if you make this batc

Good recipe! This was my first time making gnocchi, I used instant mashed potatoes (time restraint) and it still came out really good! Real potatoes as the recipe called for would be even better. Liked the versatility of seasonal vegetables, I used closer to 3 cups of veggies (asparagus, broccoli, and onion), skipped the scallion (didn't have any on hand), and next time will toss in a leek. Rich and filling meal :-)

I made this recipe and had great difficulty. I can usually follow recipes to a tea and am pretty successful but not this. The russet potatoes were not cooked enough after 35 minutes which made them lumpy, even after I used my vitamix to soften and blend. The dough required 2 extra cups of flour because it was so sticky, this in turn made the gnocchi very dense as opposed to fluffy and light. I'm not happy with how it turned or at all and will be trying a different gnocchi recipe.  Very disappointed. Not sure if I did something very wrong but I don't recommend this!

This was very good.  I used premade sweet potato gnocchi.  Over did the pesto a bit but truly worth it.
