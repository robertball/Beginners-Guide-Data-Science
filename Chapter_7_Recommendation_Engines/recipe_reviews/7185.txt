This is by far the best recipe I've found for gluten free bread.  I made this the other day for my husband and was so excited at how it turned out.  It didn't taste like gluten free which says a lot about this recipe! This is better than Alison's bread which is also a good bread recipe on this site.  When i read the reviews before making the bread I found several people had bad results and "gave up" on this recipe.  Don't take their advice, this recipe does have one mistake: the liquid/flour ratio is off.  I had to add about an extra cup of flour/starch, (rice/potato/tapioca) and if i hadn't been watching the bread machine I may have been disappointed like the other reviewers.  The dough was more like a banana bread dough than a bread dough.  I just scooped it out of my bread maker and poured it into a loaf pan and baked for about 40 mins at 350.  It rose beautifully and tasted fantastic! the only other thing i changed was to use tapioca flour instead of soy.  Update:  I have made this recipe several times now (once as muffins with cinnamon sugar in the middle -see picture) Another time I tried adding a lot more flour to get it to a more "bread dough" consistency.  This ruined the loaf, it was so dense, it didn’t rise.  Stick with a banana bread consistency and you’ll be happy.

This GF family LOVES this bread.  Here's a summary of all the reviews below that I found work best for my KitchenAid bread maker (Costco 2011)...Use the crust color medium and set for 2lb loaf.  Use sweet bread cycle (NOT GF). I use Whole Milk instead of Buttermilk (mostly out of convenience as I have it on hand)...and when I did try the buttermilk, it came out tart.  Definitely add 1/2 tsp baking powder for better texture.  I replaced the soy flour with tapioca flour.  I use brown rice flour instead of white rice flour. Add an additional 1/4 cup of tapioca flour and an additional 1/4 cup of brown rice flour.  Here's the best thing I can send along....If you are like me, making 2 loaves a week, save some time and sanity and measure out enough of the dry ingredients for 6+ loaves.  In other words, place 6 big bowls on your counter and, for example, as you dispense the salt, distribute 1 tsp into each of the 6 bowls.  SUCH a time saver.  Do NOT add the yeast here--do this only when actually making the bread (as directed on the above recipe).  Mix the dry components well, then label a 1 quart glad bag and you're set.  When it's time to make bread, add  wet ingredients to bread machine, then dump mixed, dry components on top, then yeast.  Voila!  Hope this helps!!

Wow!! I made this in my bread machine just as a dough and baked it in my oven the first time and it was great.(I changed it to rice milk and honey)..comes out like a batter bread. Then I tried it by mixing it in a bowl and letting it raise for 40 minutes stirred it down and let it rise again for 40 minute..Don't need the bread machine...Then I tried something new I heated the rice milk with 4 chopped cloves of garlic..on the second raise I add chopped onion,sun dried tomatoe,chopped green, red,& yellow pepper and a little jalapeno..oh my!! It was the best Focaccia bread..Next time I'm going to try dill. This bread can be changed in soooo many ways...Thank you so much

This makes a really, really nice bread.  The bread machine needed a little extra help as the flours used do not absorb liquids as well as wheat flour.

I used semi-skimmed milk instead of butter milk, and Terrence Stamp multi-purpose wheat free flour instead of the soya and the result was great

I've just recently started using AllRecipes and for my first time trying Gluten-Free bread, it turned out amazing! My fiancee and I have wheat and dairy intolerances so I made this recipe with almond milk instead of buttermilk. And I also used tapioca flour instead of the soy flour (since didnt have soy). The bread does seem more like a batter but still turned out incredible in the bread maker. I didn't have to bake it in the oven like some users suggested. I'm going to try using some herbs and roasted garlic in the next loaf, or I'll try some sundried tomatoes and crushed chillies for a new kick on bread. Thanks so much for this recipe.

this is BY FAR the best gluten free bread recipe I've found.  I don't use soy flour, but tapioca instead.  Also, I add 1 TBSP. unflavoured gelatin with the xanthan gum which helps give more rise and 'stretch' to the dough.  Xanthan gum can counteract the yeast somewhat, so I find this helps.  I also do not bake it in a bread machine.  I don't own one, so I mix it in my kitchen aid mixer, and then proof it in the oven.  I turn the oven on 170 until hot and then turn it off.  I then put the loaf in the oven to proof for an hour and then turn the oven on to 375 for an hour.  I bake it until it sounds hollow when tapped.  part of the problem with baking gluten free is that the doughs are so delicate.  Proofing in the oven eliminates the need to move the bread and risk it falling in the process.  Hope this helps!

I am so pleased with this recipe.  The loaf is as close as you'll ever get to regular white bread (in look and taste) in a gluten free form.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  I used regular 1% milk instead of buttermilk and added a little extra rice flour during the mixing process (likely about 1/2 cup total) to get it to the right consistancy.  Thanks so much!

I'm rather miffed by this recipe. I followed the instructions carefully and ended up with the dough running all over the place. My breadmaker was next to ruined. I will not be trying it again.

I have enjoyed many great loaves of bread from this recipe.I chose from the early recipe soy beverage instead of water,tapioca flour in place of potato starch and soy was the flour. It toasted great and tasted great with soy margarine and wild berry jam.

This bread is fantastic!  I have been trying for over a year for a good gluten free bread and this one is by far the best!  It turned out really well in the bread maker however I did add another cup of a combination of flours (tapioca, potato starch and rice flour)
I also made it will 2 eggs and it turned out fine, not quite as tall as the first one but I may experiment with a little water and corn starch to replace the one egg.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a forgiving recipe that makes tasty bread! I make it in a breadmaker (on the regular dough setting), scoop it into a greased loaf pan and smooth the top with a wet spatula, put it in a cold oven and let it rise as the oven heats up to 350. I bake it for 45 minutes and it's perfect!  We like whole grain bread, so I substitute 1 cup of brown rice flour and add 1/3 - 1/2 cup milled flax seeds.  I haven't needed to add any extra flour this way and sometimes add a little more liquid to give it the consistency of a really thick batter.  In place of the buttermilk, I've used regular milk, soy milk, or water all with good results, and when out of honey I have used white sugar, brown sugar and/or maple syrup, all with good results as well.  Today I used tapioca starch instead of potato with no problem. Hence the "forgiving" nature of the recipe!  I've tried a number of other GF bread recipes that have essentially been a waste of ingredients, but this is a good one.  My 2 year-old, 3 year-old and husband agree!

Of the gluten-free bread recipes that I've tried so far, this was definitely the best! It makes a moist bread and does not crumble when sliced. The texture is the closest I've found to "regular" bread so far. Bread machine baking can be finicky, so just make sure to follow the recipe carefully and you shouldn't have any problems.

This is by far the best GF bread recipe...I also found that adding 1 tsp of baking powder, makes the loaf rise about 30% more and creates a finer texture (not denser). Also if some of the rice flour is replaced with tapioca flour, this results in a chewier loaf. (use a sweet tapioca flour such as one from Authentic Foods: Bobs Red Mill is good, but is a sour variety).

Absolutely excellent!  I made this in a $50 Sunbeam bread machine and I can't express how pleased I am with the reults.  After struggling to make gluten free bread in the oven for my MS afflicted husband, and failing about 10 times, I just about cried when I saw how wonderfully this loaf turned out.  I used 3 1/3 cups of Bob's Red Mill AP flour mix instead of the variety of flours and kept everything else the same.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made the mistake of assuming "check consistency" meant that it should be like bread dough. Not so - the consistency should be closer to cake batter. Instructions should be updated to clarify what the dough will look like.

I made this recipe with all the exact ingredients except the buttermilk- I used 1% milk.  I baked it in the oven.  I preheat the oven to 180 F. then shut it off and immediately put the dough in to rise for 2 hours. Then I turned the oven on to 350 F. and baked for 40 minutes.    Turned out great!! I highly suggest you give this one a try.

I made this in my mixer vs in a breadmachine. A tip that I had read was to whip the Xanthum gum in order to activate it so I added it to the liquids and whipped it for 2/3 minutes in my kitchen aid before adding dry ingredients.  I poured it into a loaf pan and let it rise for 2 hours on a heating pad, baked at 350 for thirty minutes and it is just incredible.  Fluffy, light, and delicious.  I'm in shock.  It's incredible.

The most delicious GF bread recipe I've made in 4 months of GF living!!  I did make some substitutions -- 1 cup each white and brown rice flour (to equal the 2 cups rice flour), substituted 1/2 cup sorghum flour for the soy flour and substituted tapioca starch for the potato starch since I am anti-inflammatory diet conscious as well (potato is a nightshade that causes inflammation).  Used the buttermilk left over from making my own home-made butter. Used only 1 tsp white vinegar instead of apple cider since it was all I had at the time!  Best GF loaf of bread I've had since beginning this lifestyle change in July!!  The bread kept well too, in an airtight container in the refrigerator. We ate on this loaf of bread all week long!  Thanks so very much!!!

I just made this bread for the first time, and it is so good!  I do own a bread machine, but so far, I haven't had much luck making gluten-free breads in it, and I decided it would be simpler to make this bread without the machine.  I proofed the yeast with the milk and honey, put the rest of the wet ingredients in my mixer and mixed them, then added the yeast mixture and mixed some more.  Instead of the flour mix suggested, I just used Domata Living Flour, which is an all-purpose gluten-free mix that already contains xanthan gum.  I add the salt to four cups of the Domata flour, mixed with the wet ingredients until just combined, put it in a 9x5 bread pan, smoothed down the top, and baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  It turned out beautifully!

A-MA-ZING!!!  Made this in a Breadman Ultimate, following the directions exactly and it was great!  My particular machine doesn't have a "sweet" cycle so I used the white bread cycle on med-dark crust and it came out beautifully!  Thank you so much!  No more buying $5 loaves of gf bread at the grocery store.  *smiles*

I wanted white wheat bread, and this hit the spot.  If you're looking for a light fluffy white bread, this isn't it.  It's a heavy, filling bread.  Most gluten free breads are.  One slice is easily equal to 2, maybe 3, slices of wheat bread.  But it smells right.  It tastes right.  I keep it in a ziplock bag in my fridge. About the 4th day it begins to dry out a little, but just warm it up and it's fine (won't toast like wheat bread though.  I actually warm it on a higher setting on my toaster than I used to with wheat bread, because it's so dense, and takes longer to warm up).  Here's what I've done: I replaced the soy flour with tapioca.  I've made it with both brown and white flour.  Some prefer it with brown.  I don't.  I think it tastes more authentic with white.  But ... that being said, brown or white, the taste is very similar.  I reduced the apple cider vinegar just a touch.  I eye it ... it's about, say 3/4 of a Tbsp, give or take.  I found I could taste it before this.  That slight reduction was all I needed.  Some suggested 1/2 a tsp of baking powder.  I upped it to 1 tsp this last bread, and loved the texture.  Delightful!  I also noticed when the baked loaf came out, there was some flour/starch that hadn't been mixed in on the side.  So ... when your machine begins the mix, just take a spatula, and carefully scrape down the sides that still have flour.  It'll mix right in, and the loaf will be perfect.  This is a great recipe.  I highly recommend it. Thank you!

The family couldn't even tell it was gluten free.  Very good bread!  Used only 2 eggs as that's all that had on hand, used organic sugar instead of honey, used extra potato starch instead of corn starch (allergic to corn), used tapioca flour instead of soy flour, used rice milk.  I've bought frozen gluten free breads before at the grocery store and they were horrible, this recipe however is fantastic!  Thank you so much!  Edited to add:  Next day the texture is much dryer, more similar to the loaves I've gotten frozen at the grocery store, but the taste is still really good - unlike the grocery store!

Until yesterday, this was the best gf bread I had ever had.  It's really good.  

I changed a couple things based on what I had:  
almond milk instead of buttermilk,
tapioca starch instead of potato,
millet flour instead of soy.

Started it out in the bread machine, and then realized it didn't bake (don't know why; it's never done that before).  My machine does not have programmable cycles, and the sweet bread cycle did the regular 2-3 kneads/rises, so by the time I discovered it hadn't baked and scooped it into a loaf pan, the dough had been through the wringer, so to speak.   GF dough only needs one rise and no punching down.

Nevertheless, it baked up very nicely in the oven.  It tasted great, and while denser than wheat bread, it was not as dense as previous gf bread I've had (homemade or purchased). It held together well and didn't fall apart, even when sliced thinly.  It lasted at least 5 days without becoming a dry, crumbly, inedible mess.  It made a decent turkey sandwich, and was good spread with pb and jelly.  I personally did not care for it toasted, or as a grilled cheese sandwich.

I did have a few inches of the loaf left by the time it was passed its prime, so I put that in the blender and it made very nice breadcrumbs to keep in the freezer for other uses.
Just to let you know, the even better gf bread is the brown bread recipe from 125 Best GF Recipes by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt.  The texture is very close to wheat bread, soft and fluffy.

I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out great!  I used 1 cup each of white and brown rice flour, substituted the buttermilk with coconut milk and added 1/2 Tsp of baking powder and 1 TBS of gelatin to the dry ingredients.  My biggest worry now is how to not eat the whole loaf myself!

WE HAVE A WINNER! This recipe is great! I've been buying a bread mix off Amazon for the past year, but I like the way this turned out a lot better. I still might try some modifications for my own tastes, but my son LOVES this bread so that's all that matters.

This recipe turned out great! I have bought many gluten free breads (none were eatable) and made several from mixes. This bread was wonderful and the best I have tried.  The only substitution I made was buckwheat flour for the soy (I don't care for soy). Several days later the bread was still moist and delicious.

This is my favorite everyday gluten free bread recipe so far.  A little idea to save time: I premix the dry ingredients (except salt and yeast) in large quantities and keep it in a gigantic zip lock bag.  I then use 3 1/3cups of it per recipe. I also add 1 tsp of baking powder to the mix. I find sifting the dry ingredients helps making it fluffier.  If not fluffy enough for your taste, beating the egg whites will resolve the issue.

This is the best bread I have tried to date!  I have allergy to wheat, gluten, dairy & egg so this is what I did:  I didnt use rice at all (trying to avoid too much of it)  Did 1 cupe oat flour, 1/2 cup sorghum, 1/4 cup flaxmeal (grinded it up, helps with binding since I used no eggs) & 1/4 up buckwheat.  Omited eggs and used 3 TBSP applesauce mixed with 1 tsp baking powder and used 1 TBSP egg free mayo mixed with 3 TBSP water & 1 tsp baking powder again.  I found I have to use less than 1.5 cups buttermilk, more like 1 1/4 cup, even though I didnt subsitute the 3rd egg.  I didnt use cornstarch, used tapioca.  I mixed it in my bread machine but transfered the batter into my bread loaf pan and put it in the oven instead.  To make dairy free buttermilk:  1 cup non-dairy milk (i.e. soya milk) mixed with 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar or even lemon juice (I always use ACV though)  Let sit for a couple minutes.

I've been making this bread for 2 years.  It is one of the best I've found that is GF and easily made in the bread machine.  I do use quinoa flour instead of the soy, as I'm not a soy fan.  It's a very attractive loaf as well.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about too much liquid. I thought this recipe was great. It is much better than the expensive GF boxed bread mixes out there. I adapted mine to my small 1lb bread machine, but cutting it back to 8 servings. Because I was so paranoid about the other reviews I added extra flour but then ended up having to add more liquid. I think it will be fine as is, if you make sure you are making the appropriate bread size for your machines size. This was great bread. It's texture and everything was very close to "regular" bread. I'm making another loaf now. Oh and if you happen to own a crisper pan, try toasting the bread on this. It is wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing this excellent recipe!

It also started molding within two days of baking. Crumbly texture, similar to dry pound cake. Will never use this recipe again.

I have made this bread twice now. The first time I made it per the first 'most helpful review' and added an entire extra cup of potato starch. The bread was good, but was VERY dense. I'm not sure if the recipe has been altered since that review was written and now the recipe is accurate, but do NOT add extra starch or flour. The second time I made it I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it came out so much better - much lighter and fluffier. It's still denser than your standard white bread, but it honestly taste identical to regular white bread. SO good. My picky toddler will eat a grilled cheese with this, which is a huge feat. I made this in my bread machine on the 'sweet bread' setting and it came out perfect.

Made this in the bread machine - and it turned out great. I did warm the milk slighty and brought the eggs to room temp. I've been searching for a "normal" gluten'free bread that tastes good for my 13 year old to take for school lunches.

Great gluten-free bread.  I followed the recipe but added a little bit more of the rice flour, soy flour and potato starch.  My bread machine is a Hamilton Beach HomeBaker bread machine ($45 Walmart).  I used sweet bread cycle.  I really appreciated the review from SMS on July 27, 2011, who summed up everything.  I will try the tapioca flour instead of the soy because I am trying to cut out soy.  "Here's a summary of all the reviews below that I found work best:  Use the crust color medium and set for 2lb loaf. Use sweet bread cycle (NOT GF). I use Whole Milk instead of Buttermilk (mostly out of convenience as I have it on hand)and when I did try the buttermilk, it came out tart. Definitely add 1/2 tsp baking powder for better texture. I replaced the soy flour with tapioca flour. I use brown rice flour instead of white rice flour. Add an additional 1/4 cup of tapioca flour and an additional 1/4 cup of brown rice flour. If you are like me, making 2 loaves a week, save some time and measure out enough of the dry ingredients for 6+ loaves. In other words, place 6 big bowls on your counter and, for example, as you dispense the salt, distribute 1 tsp into each of the 6 bowls. Do NOT add the yeast here--do this only when actually making the bread (as directed on the above recipe). Mix the dry components well, then label a 1 quart glad bag and you're set. When it's time to make bread, add wet ingredients to bread machine, then dump mixed, dry components on top, then yeast."

THANK YOU SO MUCH! finally, a bread that tastes almost like real bread! My husband loved it and said he wants it again and he can eat real bread! I had to sub a few things I didn't have. I used milk, used brown sugar syrup instead of honey and tapioca flour instead of soy. Took one of the reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Also added a little flax seed and sunflower seeds for extra flavor. I used the standard 4 hour cycle on my panasonic breadmaker, no sweet or gluten free cycle available.

I am overall very pleased with this recipe.  As other reviewers said, the bread is moist, tasty and not crumbly at all.  What I love the most is a "large" slice of bread that I can make a real sandwich with... and it bakes in my bread machine.
Before I continue, I'll mention that I also made some substitutions as necessary.  I used brown rice flour instead of white.  I also had to substitute quinoa flour for the soy.  
Contrary to other reviewers, I found that I had to add an additional cup of buttermilk because my dough was too thick.  I live in Calgary which is over 3000 ft above sea level and it is very, very dry.  I was trying to achieve the "banana bread dough" consistency that others described.  
My loaf eventually baked well but "fell" a little in the center.

What a blessing to have "real" bread again! I used a gluten-free flour mix instead of the different flours. You couldn't tell it wasn't a wheat bread, and I enjoyed a BLT sandwich for the first time in years! Thank you, Aaron!

I've made this bread many times exactly as stated in the recipe. It's my favorite gluten free white bread. It is very important to follow step 2 and check the consistency of the bread in the bread machine after 5 minutes.

I have made this bread 3 different times, the 2nd and third times I substituted ingredients according to what I have in my house at the time, each time it had turned out wonderful!
Substitutions I have made include:
-molasses instead of honey
- almond or soy milk instead of buttermilk
-more potato starch instead of cornstarch
-1 cup buckwheat flour & 1 cup brown rice flour instead of 2 cups white rice flour.
I am in love with this recipie & will continue to experiment with it too! Highly reccomended, even my non-GF friends enjoyed this bread!

I found this recipe on Monday. After reading such great reviews my boyfriend and I ran right out to get a bread machine, very excited to try this for ourselves. Six hours later we finally found a machine. (Apparently most are sold on line now) Tuesday morning we made the bread exactly as originaly written, didnt mess with one ingredient, put it all in our $46.00 Sears Kenmore bread machine, and much to our suprise...2 1/2 hours later popped out the best gluten free bread EVER! It was just like the old white bread I used to eat years ago and never thought I would be able to eat again. I am so happy to have found this recipe,I can now enjoy real peanutbutter and jelly sandwiches again! Thank you so much for posting this

My daughter loved this bread. It baked beautifully on the regular bread setting in our breadmaker and didn't make an overly thick crust.  I made the following alterations based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  1.5 tsps of white vinegar instead of cider vinegar, tapioca flour in place of potato, millet flour in place of soy flour, 1 cup of brown rice to replace one cup of the white rice, and rice milk instead of buttermilk.  Even my kids who are not gluten-sensitive loved it.

This is amazing gluten free bread. Closest "regular bread" mimic I've come across. No toasting necessary! The key ingredient in this bread is the xanthan gum so DON'T SKIP IT! This loaf has lasted me 7 days in the bread drawer. Used soy milk in place of the buttermilk. Just one added ingredient: Dough Enhancer, I highly recommend it for all your GF bread baking.

I can't express how happy I am to have found this recipe.   It's such a joy to have a slice of bread that tastes so good after years of going without. The proportion of ingredients is perfect.   The only thing I do differently is I mix all the dry ingredients together  in a bowl first before adding it to the wet ingredients.   Also, as soon as the machine starts mixing I help it along with a rubber spatula as my machine does not do a good job.   I always find gluten free bread tastes best when toasted.

This was the very first bread I had ever made. I love this bread. It comes out perfect in my cuisinart bread maker every time. I've made it now about 10 times in a row. My husband keeps trying to get me to branch out and explore some other recipes too. (He loves this bread). I can't seem to move on. This really satisfies my urge for a classic bread. I eat it mainly toasted with butter every day.
Used tapioca starch instead of cornstarch
Used almond flour instead of soy flour
Used coconut milk instead of butter milk
Used instant bread machine yeast
Pre-warmed liquids
Browned top in oven after. Love this bread!!

This was great!  I thought this was better than store-bought gluten-free bread.  I did make some changes however, so that is why it is a 4-star, but with the changes, it is a 5-star.  I didn't have honey so I used maple syrup.  I used an all-purpose gluten free flour instead of the soy flour and add about 1/2 cup flour because the batter was really wet.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder as recommended by another user.

After searching in vain for a decent gluten free bread recipe this exceeded expectations. Perhaps the toughest thing about having to give up gluten for health reasons is giving up such basic things as bread, and finding a palatable recipe has been an expensive, frustrating nightmare. Thanks to this recipe the nightmare is over! In my machine I had to increase the rice flour by about half a cup, but that may have been because my eggs were very large. All in all the bread came out very moist with an excellent texture. My dough behaved quite nicely and delivered a loaf that looked exactly as pictured. I did combine all of the wet and all of the dry ingredients separately, and added them to my machine wet first, then dry, as called for by my manufacturer's instructions. Thank you for this recipe! Aaaah, bread!

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I used potato flour by mistake (did pay attention when I was shopping for gluten free flours) and it turned out dense, heavy, inedible.  The second time, I used potato starch as it called for.  I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of probably 1/8 cup of rice flour while it was mixing.  I held myself back from adding too much additional rice flour and stuck with looking for that 'banana bread' consistency.  I'm very happy with the results and it's probably the best gluten free bread I've tasted. Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing!

I substituted whole milk for buttermilk and maple syrup for honey.  I also added a bit more rice flour and then a bit more soy flour during the "kneading" phases because the dough seemed very thin and batter-like.  Otherwise made as instructed on the "rapid" setting in my Biltwell Bread Machine.

The bread was tasty and came out moist with a crisp brown crust.  It was slightly granular in texture (probably having to do with the brand of rice flour I used).  I also thought it could use some more salt.  I will absolutely make this again!

This is a good basic bread for the bread machine.
If you don't want eggs or milk:  Use 1 cup of non dairy milk soured with 1tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of warm water. beat in 3 TBS ground flax to the milk. I make this recipe with besan flour instead of soy and 1 cup of brown rice + 1 cup of Oat flour instead of the white rice flour.Cook on white large in bread machine. Makes the best gluten free bread my family has tasted :)

Fabulous!! We have been gluten free for almost 6 years and this is one of the best breads I have had, especially out of a machine. (I usually make it by hand)

I did change some things: we are Dairy free also, so the milk I did a straight swap of buttermilk to Soy Milk+lemon juice (to keep the acid balance the same) I used buckwheat flour instead of soy flour and for the 2 c of white rice flour I used about 1  cups white rice flour, 3/4 c brown rice flour and 1/4 c corn flour.  I was using up an assortment of bits of flours I had. I have no doubt that it would be equally good with the flours as written.

I used the regular white bread setting on the breadmaker, as it gives more time to  work the dough and let the liquids fully hydrate the flours. I scraped about 2x. My dough looked thick, but not as thick as wheat bread dough.

This is a good loaf of gf bread and an excellent on for beginners to start with due to it's forgiving nature.  We are 3 months into living gf due to our 8 year old daughter and this recipe was used for multiple 'bready' items and had multiple substitutions as I acquired more of the different flours.  A few hints to help people tackling this without a bread machine and the recipe in general.  First, if you don't have buttermilk,warm whatever milk up and add vinegar (let it sit). Mix the dry ingredients and the wet seperate.  Combine all mixing well and it should be a batter bread consistency-think gloppy. Careful b/c if you sub. flours it can make it more dry so you might need to add some water.  This happened to me when I used buckwheat flour. Put it all in a greased loaf pan, cover, and put in a warm over that has been shut off.  Mine rises an inch above the edge of the loaf pan which is the norm for gf bread I've read.  I'm playing with times yet but as another stated 350 for 50 min. seems to be a good base.  It must sound hollow when tapped, another gf thing!  Also, I do have to cover the top of mine with foil about half way thru the baking so it doesn't brown to much.  I'll update this as I"m going to try a few loaves with the addition of 1 tsp of baking soda as another reviewer suggested.  Hope this helps!  Good luck!

Very happy about the result! Since I didn't have soy flour and potato starch, I used brown rice flour and tapioca flour instead. I used eggs from my happy chickens and organic ingredients except yeast. I made 2/3 of the amount since my bread maker is not so big. I mixed all wet ingredients first in a bowl and poured over the mixed flour in the machine. It turn out tasty and beautiful. I like its subtle sweetness.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe, Aaron!

This is truely a good gluten free recipe! It has a kind of stretchy texture, and is a littl different, but it is nummy! I used brown rice flour instead of the white rice flour, flaxseed instead of the eggs, and non dairy milk instead of the buttermilk. Great!

TASTE GREAT NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM GLUTEN FREE BREAD!!!. Changes I made used 1 1/2 C rice milk, 1 tbls + 1 tsp guar gum instead of xanthan (allergy issues), 1/3 + 1/2 C potato starch, tapioca instead of soy flour, 3/4 C 1 1/2 C wht rice flour, 1 C brown rice flour, 1 1/2 tsp yeast. I added home made dough enhancer 1/8 tsp ascorbic acid, 1 tsp pectin, 1/4 ginger. dough was perfect just like regular dough not like banana bread consistency. made on dough setting in bread maker then baked at 350 in oven for 25 minutes then reduced  325 because it was browning to quick for 15 minutes.  It taste really great and was soft on inside not hard like store brand gluten. would have given 5 stars if i did not have to make so many changes.

I think this was the best tasting Gluten free bread I've made from scratch or from a mix. My dough was sticky so I had to add more flour, and I had to add to the baking time when the timer went off. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own (I used 4 1/2tsp. of lemon juice then added milk to make the 1 1/2cups, then added 3 tsp. of baking soda) I even use lactose free skim milk. Also, I used 1/4c of egg beaters in place of one of the eggs to lower the fat!  I would definately make this one again. I enjoyed having a sandwhich for the first time since going GF!

I did not have the same stunning success most of you had.  I varied the flour and still the loaf was dense. I finally got a loaf that rose and was "fluffy" by replacing one cup rice flour with 1 cup soy flour.  I used the "dough" setting on my bread machine and baked it in the oven.

This recipe works well in my Cuisinart bread maker on the gluten free cycle.  I live in a very dry climate so I started with the 1 1/4 c of buttermilk (I used the buttermilk pwdr you keep in the fridge)and I did not have to add any extra water.  Also I did not have corn starch so I looked up substitutes and used 2 tsp of tapicoa flour for every 1 T of cornstarch. Do take the time to scrape down the sides of the pan during the first knead to make sure everything mixes right.  We loved this bread.  Even my non-GF kids loved this bread.  I am really quite surprised at how good it is.

I just bought a Black and Decker bread machine, (first one ever) online at Walmart for approx 11.00. i was just looking to see how much they were and then this one was so cheap, I figured it was a typo and they would catch it when i paid for it; but no i received it for that price and this was the first recipe i tried. The first round did not go so well since I missed a vital ingredient due to my printer not printing one main ingredient and i did not catch it! the 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk! don't know why or how the printer missed this but when I checked the recipe to see if I missed something (liquid, since it was not getting doughy in the machine) the recipe showed online with the buttermilk but not my print out. so I dumped the whole thing and tried again(don't want to do that too often $$). The second time was the charm! What an awesome loaf of bread! it is perfect! I love it! Thank you so much!

It looks and tastes like real bread. Amazing! I love it. I did substitute the butter milk with almond milk (all I had) and instead of using the bread machine I mixed all the ingredients in a food processor and baked the bread in the oven for 45 minutes at 350% F.

I made this recipe for the first time last night using "SMS" comments recommended modifications.  It turned out so good that my non-gluten free husband loved it too.  Most bread is wonderful when it is hot from the oven, but this bread was good the next day cold for my lunch.  I have no wonderful modifications to share, just the comments of a "new" gluten free person.  I will make this again and again.

The cost of ingredients - $70
The cost of oxo containers for the ingredients - $100
The taste of this bread -priceless.

I have bought every brand of bread I could find and tried numerous recipes. This is FINALLY something worth eating. It is a little yeasty, but otherwise, great.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC BREAD. I have to say whomever down grades this bread really doesn't know what they are talking about. This bread turns out beautifully if you just follow the directions and proper measurements you will not have a problem. Just add all ingredients in order on this recipe to your bread maker, set your machine to sweet breads and press start. There should be no need to add anything to this recipe. Before you know it you have a perfect loaf. I thank you very much for your recipe and I highly recommend to everyone.

I've been trying gf bread recipes for over a year now, and this by far is the closest I've come to in a long time to the real thing.  Dense enough to hold together, without being dry or mealy, and pretty close to the "bread" taste that I remember from 10+ years ago. I'll definetly keep this and use it to build on and tweak to my own personal taste.

The best! No more buying dry, expensive GF bread for me. My bread machine was given to me and by the time it beeped, I realized that it didn't bake; the heating element doesn't work, so I scraped it out and baked in it the oven at 375 for 35 minutes. Perfect. Thanks for such a great recipe.

My husband has gluten sensitvity.  I don't have a bread machine.  I used the ingredients exactly as listed.  I let the dough rise for about 2 hours, then baked it in the oven for about 40 min. at 350 deg.  My husband said it's better than Udi's.  I just hope it keeps well.

Yum!  Yes it is dense, but that is SO much better than dry and crumbly..  Slices wonderfully.  Put two slices in the oven with a little butter, garlic and parm cheese.  Hubby who is not celiac wanted more of "my" bread!

WOW!!!  I can't believe this bread!  I have spent SO much money on pre-packaged bread mixes only to have them fail miserably.  This bread turned out GREAT, it tastes great, it looks like normal bread, and I was able to make it in my bread machine.  Amazing!  Thank you so much!!  I am having french toast for dinner tonight!

This is the 2nd GF recipe I've tried and it is fantastic!  It has a nice consistency and it is truly like "real" bread.  I didn't have any white rice flour so I used brown, and since we can't do soy flour I used oat bran.  I let all of my ingredients come to room temperature before mixing and I did combine the ingredients by hand before putting them into my bread machine as mine does not do a great job of mixing without the help.  I followed the recommendation of adding about an extra half cup of potato starch.  I also chose to bake it in the oven instead of in the machine.  All in all we were extremely pleased with this bread and it will definitely become a staple.  I can't wait to try mix ins and variations as some people have mentioned.

This was my first gluten free bread and I loved it.  It doesn't feel so daunting to have to go gluten free with all these amazing recipes.  I used tapioca flour in place of soy flour and white wine vinegar plus 1 Tbsp sugar because I can't get Apple Cider Vinegar or soy flour here.  I also used rice milk in place of buttermilk. I added 1/4 cup tapioca and 1/4 rice flour for consistency.  I'll be using this recipe again!

good gluten free bread.  It was similar to "Gluten Free Pantry's French bread and pizza mix"  I rated it a 4 stars though because it was TOO SWEET so I will reduce the honey for next time.    I will also from now make substitutions with more nutritious gluten free flours, such as buckwheat, coconut flour and others.  The one thing that is really missing from a gluten free bread is the protein and fiber, so I seek to remedy that through substitutions.  Great base and cheaper to make it than to buy made or from a kit.

I made this for a friend who is gluten-intolerant, and who doesn't have time to bake.  Though I did not taste the bread myself, she emailed the moment she received it and called it "phenomenal" and asked for the recipe immediately!  I did substitute 1/2 cup sorghum flour for 1/2 cup of the white rice flour, and substituted gluten-free potato flakes for the potato starch.  The batter was fairly stiff, somewhat like a muffin batter. Using the buttermilk as called for kept the dough fairly stiff, so I did not increase the amount of liquid. I let the batter (or dough) rest in a warming drawer for about 15 minutes before spooning into the greased loaf pan. I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer. I tested it with a toothpick to test for doneness, since this isn't a typical yeast bread.  My friend raved about both the flavor and the texture, which she remarked was similar to a moist quick bread.  I can't wait to try some myself, even though we don't have problems with gluten in our family. Thanks for a recipe that really works beautifully!

Very nice texture.  I used green pea flour instead of soy flour because I didn't have any and tapioca starch instead of potato starch for the same reason.  Added Italian herbs and 1/2 teaspoon extra salt for flavour.  It turned out great.  Will experiment with other add-ins next time.

Surprisingly moist. After reading other reviews, I added a cup of flour to the mix. When I checked on the kneading process it looked quite dry so I added more buttermilk. It still tasted very good and met with my 6 y.o.'s approval. Next time I'll do recipe as written (again replacing soy flour with tapioca since I always keep tapioca flour on hand).

I tried ths recipe for my niece's daughter. I had problems the first time because I wasn't using a bread machine. I had no idea what the bread texture was supposed to be. When I brought it to my niece she was excited, she said it was great and she never tasted a gluten-free bread this good before. She said the texture was great too.Thank you for this recipe

This was a very different recipe than the usual gf bread.I liked the tangy taste of the buttermilk. I added ground flaxseed and a "trail mix" style blend of nuts to give any gf bread more nutrients. Pumpkin, sunflower, chopped almonds etc. Just add more milk and oil to compensate the dryness for these additions.

This wonderful recipe is the first gluten-free recipe I have made that actually tasted like "real" bread.  My bread machine has no trouble with it (although I substitute brown rice and tapioca flour for the soy).  It is so easy, my 7 year old daughter is now the bread baker for our house!  It also tastes great with a 3/4 cup flaxseed egg substitute.

This is the best ever gluten-free bread I've ever made! Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I added raisins and chopped dry fruits to my recipes. The first time I only added cynamon and cloves. It is very yummi-yummi.
Hey, just adding a comment: After making it for some 4 or 5 times, I noticed that it is sometimes kind of dry! So, I added a bit more oil. I'm using 1/3 of olive oil and it is far more better and soft. A bit more humid, very nice! I keep it on a plastic bag into the fridge. Great recipe!

Great Recipe!! I have tried many bread recipes without a machine and I have not been satisfied since I am trying to get as close to regular store bought bread as possible. I have purchased the frozen brands at the store and still was not satisfied. This is the first recipe that I have tried with a machine and it is a fabulous rendition of white bread. It cuts well, it holds together well and it has a really good flavor. I ate 2 pieces with butter while it was still warm and I haven't even tried it when it was cooled off on a sandwich yet but I am sure it will taste just as great. It was nice and easy to throw all of the ingredients in the bread machine and wait for the results which met my expectations fully!!

Great recipe, I read the comments and added 1 T gelatin, 1 tsp baking powder, and just used a combination of flours and starches adding up to 3 1/2 cups, about 2/3 of a cup being potato starch. the rest was about 1 cup sweet rice flour, 1 cup tapioca flour, and then some random amounts of quinoa and black bean flours until I had a total of 3.5 cups between the flours and the starch. I used the sweet bread cycle on my bread machine and popped it out warm...so delish! Thank you for your comments that helped to fine tune it a little, I'm sure it would have been fine straight off the cuff, but I like tweaking recipes when I can...

This bread is really good! I'm not a huge fan of the flavour of bean flours so I used sorghum flour in place of the soy flour. I also didn't use as much oil and used water & buttermilk powder. The bread was moist & flavourful. As with all GF breads, the batter is really like a quick bread and it should be! Don't mess with it. Tucked this away in the freezer for toast cravings. Very good. Thank you so much for posting this. It's given me hope!

I made this according to directions but with rice milk.  I used oven instead of bread machine.  I let it rise for 40 min..punched it down and let it rise for another 40 min.  While it had a wonderful taste..it didn't rise.  It was about 2 inches high after it baked .   If someone could tell me what I might have done wrong....or how to change a bread machine bread to an oven bread I would really appreciate it!  Thanks.  j. minton

I love this recipe but it doesn't always turn out perfect.  Wondering if it is because without weighing there is a slight difference with each loaf.  Does anyone have the ingredients as weights??

good for gluten free. really good fresh, but quite dry if you eat later. Probably typical for gluten free bread. Also, I did not need to add more flour then the recipe calls for.

Not substitute friendly!  I put in soured milk for the buttermilk and an All Purpose Gluten free flour to replace the 3 cups of other flours.  The goo overflowed in my breadmaker.  This was horribly messy to clean up.  I split it into two loaf pans and set it in the oven to finish rising.  It overflowed both of them as well, all over my oven.  I'm NOT a happy camper.  It's baking now, if it fills the whole oven I won't be surprised.

This the best bye far of all the bread out there that I have tryed all ready and I'm very picky in my tast. This bread you can do so much to and chance the flours all a round. It don't matter which one you use. That is what is so great and other things to it. I make noughthing else now. I'm even useing it for my stuffing mix this year...

I love this bread. My only complaint is that it is really dense, and sometimes seems soggy. It does not freeze well, always too doughy when it is thawed out. I may try popping it in the oven for a few minutes after the bread machine finishes with it and see if that   helps. Really good bread with some Nutella!

I converted this receipe to GFCF,  changed the types of flours, and it was delicious! I substituted quinoa flour for the soy, brown rice flour for the white rice flour, as well as replacing the dairy with Silk Original coconut milk. Yummy! Oh...for those wondering, it did not have a coconutty flavor. I think the richness of the flours I used and the honey keep that from occurring. Hope this helps some other families :)

Turned out GREAT! I substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk and almond flour for the soy flour. Turned out really well and rose nicely.

Replaced the various flours and cornstarch with 3 1/3 c. GF All Purpose Flour (krusteaz brand). Added 1 tsp baking powder. Dissolved  yeast in slightly warmed skim milk (instead of butter milk). Put dry ingredients in mixer and mixed on low to "fluff" the flour. Whisked the eggs, added other wet ingredients together & poured them into the mixer, mixing the dough fully. Made a thick batter bread consistency. Heated the oven to 170 and then turned off. Poured batter into greased loaf pan & placed in oven with door closed for 50 min. Left in oven, turned oven to 375 and let bake about 50 min. It started browning too quickly so I placed a foil tent over it.  Next time I'll add more salt and perhaps more honey or sugar. Needs a bit more flavor for me. Was great with butter and strawberry freezer jam!! The texture was heavenly!!!!! I want to experiment with this more maybe adding some pumpkin & spices!

What a fantastic recipe! The things I changed are simply because I didn't have all the required ingredients. I uses 1 cup brown rice flour and 1 cup white rice flour (didn't have enough white), substituted tapioca flour for potato, and since I don't have a bread machine, I plopped it in a bread pan, let it rise once, then baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe, it will make this whole gluten free thing a whole lot easier!

Since my husband is diabetic, to avoid a blood sugar spike I use a whole grain baking mix. I totaled the flours, gums and starches  to get an equivalent 3 1/3 cup GF baking mix. Based on other reviewers I added another 2/3 cup of mix for a total 4 cups mix and it had a "banana bread" consistency. 

Without the xantham gum (which I cannot use), it still crumbles. Next time I will add 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin and 1 Tablespoon Sure Jell pectin, which should help it hold together better. 

After  first rise, I scooped out the dough and split it between three GENEROUSLY OILED baking pans for the second rise, being careful not to fill beyond half full (preventing a messy spill-over). 

Both times I have made this recipe, the bread has fallen and sunk in the middle.  Next time I will probably set the timer for a 20 minute rise in my oven, and then turn my oven on to bake immediately - without moving the pans. Bake the mini loaves at 350 for 35 minutes. 

This is definitely a recipe for intermediate or advanced users. 

Despite all the issues above, this came out with a  wonderful taste - far better than the store-bought heavy GF bread that I have been paying $5.00 a loaf for.  

Thanks for sharing!

This is the BEST recipe we have found anywhere so far for a gluten-free bread.  It is moist, where every other kind we have tried has the dry, crumbly texture that is not favorable!  I actually do this in the bread machine on the basic dough cycle, and then transfer it to a bread pan and bake it in the oven for 25-27 minutes (just because the breadmaker makes more of a "bottom crust" than we like.  We love it!

As far as gluten free goes....this bread was great. It works well for toast or just bread with peanut butter. But it's too dry and crumbly for a sandwich.

this always turns out to be a bread sized version of a tea-biscuit for me, and it always caves in. I must be doing something wrong but I followed all the directions as listed and on GF setting on my bread maker.

I use this recipe as the basis for gluten-free bread-machine bread all the time now. I like to mix up the combination of flours. My personal favorite: 1 cup brown rice flour; 1 cup tapioca flour; 1 + 1/3 cup oat flour. I also tend to use less xantham gum (1+1/2 - 2 tsp) and substitute agave nectar for honey, and the recipe works out fine. I consistently have a problem with the bread collapsing, which I still haven't been able to get around.

This tasted awful. It gets two stars because eating it with honey and butter makes it easier to gulp down and it wasn't a total waste of ingredients.  Made it as written.  It was just SO bland. I know bread is supposed to be bland, but this was SUPER bland... I'm trying to find a recipe so i don't have to buy $5.50 loafs, but this recipe is definitely not it...

This is a very good gluten free bread.   It stays moist longer than most gluten free bread.  I' happy that there's no bean flour in the recipe. I substituted some ingredients that I'm allergic to and the bread still came out very tasty.

Very easy recipe. The only change I made was I used 3 cups of all purpose gluten free flour blend and 1/3 cup arrow root powder in place of the corn starch. Once loaf is completely cool it slices very nicely.  Toasts nicely too.

I agree with the reviewers who say the liquid to flour ratio is not quite right. I had to add about a cup more flour. Next time I will reduce the liquid instead because mine overflowed the bowl when it baked. In spite of this I still feel it was a success and the flavour is good. I am taking it to my sister's today to have with chili after the sleigh ride! Happy New Year!

Wow! This was so much better than the overpriced bricks that pass for GF bread in the grocery store! Great texture--nice and springy and didn't fall apart in a sandwich; very close to gluten bread. I followed other users' recommendations and used the dough cycle on the bread machine, then baked it in the oven (still in the bread machine pan). This will be my go-to recipe during the holidays, when turkey sandwiches are a must.

This recipe has made me love my new bread maker!  I did follow a few of the changes in the comments (added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup each of both kinds of flour)  I also used soy milk due to a dairy allergy and it came out great!!  I will definitely be making this again!

One of my favorite gluten free bread recipes.  I am always substituting some kind of flour or another, sorghum instead of white rice etc depending on what is in my cupboard..but as long as there is a good balance of very fine flours (tapioca, cornstarch or potato flours)to the heavier flours(rice, sorghum, soy) it always seems to work out.

I have tried A LOT of GF bread recipes and this one is by far the best! The only change I made was changing soy flour to sorghum flour because of personal preference.  Still, this turns out to be a great loaf!

I was dubious that ANY gluten free bread could be good, but this actually is. I checked it throughout the bread machine process and was surprised to see it rise. As suggested by others, I had added some baking powder and extra flour to combat the humidity of the day. Don't expect store bought type white bread. This is more like Irish soda bread...moist inside and crunchy outside. It isn't bland or weird textured as other things I've tried baking have been. This recipe is a keeper, which makes this recovering bread-aholic very happy.

I use this all the times, and its the best I have ever found, I did not have cider Vinegar so I used a little of wine Vinegar, it still came our fine.
I freeze and use when required, as always it a hit and miss at the beginning.
Good Luck to anyone just starting

This recipie is great. I can only buy boxes of mixed gluten free flour all incorporated (including xantham gum) and it still worked out great at these measurements. Few changes though based on other reviews:
Used milk instead of buttermilk. Used half tsp baking powder as well. Used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar.

This turned out okay, but more like a loaf or a cake. You could not make a sandwich out of it, but okay with butter and a soup side dish.

Tastes great! Moist and surprisingly fluffy for GF bread! Quite impressive! Like the rest, I used an extra 1/2 c of flour and it worked great!

Very Good! 

I didn't have Soy Flour - so I used Garbanzo Bean Flour. Also, I used a buttermilk substitute with Soy Milk & Distilled White Vinegar. (1 1/2 cup soy milk & 1 1/2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar.

Thanks Aaron!

I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing the soy flour and potato starch with tapioca flour, and using milk instead of buttermilk (because that's what I had on hand).  The bread turned out fairly dense and moist but edible.  There is an odd taste to it, perhaps from the tapioca or corn starch.  I've never tasted gluten free bread before this, but overall taste/texture of this gluten free bread is quite different from the tender, comforting taste of a regular loaf of bread!

This bread is good for a from scratch recipe.  I think a couple people mentioned about it being like a muffin batter...mine was more like a watery pancake batter.  I added 1/2 cup more of rice flour and followed everything else almost exactly.  No buttermilk...made my own.  It still didn't thicken like a dough but it did end up rising (but fell a tiny bit when my son bumped up against the bread machine.) Overall it was a little spongy but tasted ok and i'm sure it will make a good bread for toast.  Will try again.

Okay, this was my first attempt to making any gluten free bread and my daughter really liked it.  I did make some substitutions due to lack of ingredients, and the fact that my daughter can't eat soy.  So here are my substitutsions: agave for the honey 1 Tbsp of vinegar in 2 % milk for the buttermilk Teff flour for the soy flour  Brown rice flour for the White rice flour  I have a setting on my bread machine for gluten free bread and so I used that.  It came out a little underdone, so I threw it in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes.  Overall we're quite happy.  I'm going to reduce the rice flour and add some nut/bean flours instead and try that. =)

Well, I made a few changes after looking at the numerous reviews.  I used a combination of white and brown rice flour. Used chia seeds (1Tbs mixed with a  Tbs water) instead of xanthan gum and used arrowroot starch instead of potato starch.  First off, the amount of flour is definitely incorrect.   I looked at the gluten free recipe that came with my bread machine and it was very similar except that my recipe called for an extra cup of flour.  I put everything in the bread machine  on the dough setting and after about 10 minutes it looked like a cream soup.  I then starting adding more rice flour and added about an extra 1 cup.  I was sceptical when the cycle was done as it seemed so thin but I poured it into a loaf pan, into the oven, set it at 350° and let it go.  It baked for about 40 minutes and did rise and bake okay.  It is dense but the taste is better then I thought it would be.  In a nutshell, it needs an extra cup of flour!

This is a wonderful versatile recipe for a 'white' GF dough. I have used it to bake bread in the breadmaker, and in the oven make pizza crust , dinner rolls, and monkey bread. It always turns out well.  I sub the soy flour for either almond or oat flour, depending on what the end use will be. I often use just whole milk that I add the ACV to instead of buttermilk with good results.

As Lee would say, "something is wrong".  The video is different from the list of ingredients.  She says 3/4 cup of corn starch, vs 1/3 on the list.  Also, the list shows 2 TBSP GF.  GF what?  It is not in the video at all.  I read another reviewers note, from Jan 2018.  She says 3-1/2 cup flour.  This says 2-1/2 cups.  Why is it different?  Has someone changed the recipe?  Sorry, these are big changes.  Do you really expect people to follow your recipes?  At all?  Ever?  Buy the way, humidity  and seasons changes things on baking.  I think weight rather than volume is better.  Recipes with weight are different, and maybe more difficult for many people.  I hope this helps you.

Phenomenal.  Used almond flour instead of soy flour. Let batter rise is loaf pan for about an hour in a warm oven with  greased plastic wrap loosely on top. Took it out, preheated the oven to 375 and cooked for about a half hour, tested with a toothpick.

This bread was very good, Since I didn't have any soy flour I used sorghum flour.  Turned out a little dense, I may try to cook it in the oven next time as my bread machine tends to overcook.

This bread is so versatile! I have had to swap out flours and starches numerous times, it always comes out as long as the substitute ratios are there. Tapioca, garbanzo,almond, it all works if you stick with the banana bread consistency in the bread machine. Hot tip is to add two teaspoons of baking powder to get that vinegar to bubble, and add some of that milk to proof the yeast and get a head start, as the sweet cycle is shorter than normal yeast breads. I have also added interesting things, like a teaspoon of instant coffee and unsweetened cocoa powder,cinnamon, pecans, cheeses...not all at the same time. Holds together well enough for French toast!!

My husband doesn’t really like gluten free bread,  although I’ve tried many recipes in my bread machine trying to find one he’d like. This one hit the bullseye. It was moist, held together well, and actually lasted in our pantry until we finished it up during the week. GREAT RECIPE - give it a try.

After several attempts at gluten free bread (most turned out too dense), made this and it turned out extremely well!  Read the reviews and was prepared with additional flour - didn't need it.  I added up all the flour necessary, and substituted the 3 1/3 cup total with Better Batter all purpose flour.  It already has the xanthan gum in it as well so omitted that.   Didn't have buttermilk so used whole milk as 1 reviewer suggested.  So soft, light and airy - has the texture of white bread.  Tastes delicious!  This one is a keeper!

The best gluten free bread that ive ever tried ! I tried it a wee ago, it turned out amazing! I've made 3,4 loaf so far. it's been successful! I substitute the white rice with brown rice to make it healthier and used more of brown rice flour instead of soy flour. Then added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for texture as one of the reviews recommended and used coconut oil instead of olive oil. Regardless of the so much change, it just works right every time with no drama. I put ingredients in my bread machine at night, set a timer and let it go. In the morning, my home is filled with the delicious aroma of  fresh bread that makes my day! Before I tried this, I had been trying to find the best recipe for gluten free bread since gluten free bread on the market is too expensive and too small.  I tried all most all recipes on web, most of them were not successful. Either way, too dense or too chewy, almost like a rice cake. I'm so glad that I found this recipe. I'm so happy with how it turned out. I will sit on it forever ! Thanks :)

So far so good!  I made it, and my husband who's not gluten free said it was great - I haven't tried it yet and will for my breakfast tomorrow toasted, but it rose more than any gf bread I've made I'd say.  I took one person's advice about proofing it in a warmed oven and another person's advice about adding 1/4 t. baking powder.  I had no potato starch and not interested in soy flour so I used tapioca flour.  Mixed it in my bread machine and baked in oven after proofing (170 degrees and shut off, then cooked at 375 for approximately 45-50 mins I think).  Will update if can -

I've made this many times.  It's good, a little dense but what GF bread isn't...unless you want bread crumbs in your lap.  I've been curious about step 2..check consistency and adjust.  What should the consistency be?

I made as close to as written as possible.  I couldn't find xanthan gum so used dry gelatin.  Also only had skim milk.  The bread sunk in the middle.  It still is tasty though!  I will try again adding more dry ingredients and/or let the bread machine mix it up and bake it in the oven.  Not giving up yet!

Best gluten free bread recipe I've found so far! Even better that I can make it in my bread maker since gluten free dough can be so hard to work with.

Followed all instructions - including using the Sweet Bread setting on the bread machine (Cuisinart Convection Bread Machine). I think that was the mistake. Bread had been rising nicely, but second kneading and rise destroyed it. Machine has a gluten free setting with only one rise and I think this is essential. Flavor was great, but came out like a hockey puck.

It's the best tasting recipe I tried so far. I used regular milk instead of buttermilk because I had that on hand. I adjusted it to fit with my premixed 1 to 1 Pamela's flour blend.  I also used the 1/3 cup of cornstarch, 1/2 cup of coconut flour, 1/2 cup of arrowroot flour and then used 2 cups of the blend (it is sweet brown rice, white rice, potato starch, tapioca flour, guar gum and something else I can't remember). I also only used 1/4 tsp of xanthan gum since my blend had guar gum in it. I also added a 1/2 tbsp. of baking powder to help make it lighter.  This turned out perfect!  The only thing was my bread didn't round on the top, it came out just flat but the body of the bread rose really well and I am still satisfied with it. Next time I might use just 1/8 tsp of xanthan gum since I found it a little gummy in the center.  During mixing make sure you check your batter, I had to add a teensy bit of warm water to make sure the dough was wet enough.  Overall very thrilled with the taste of this bread!

Wow!  I had looked at the reviews before I made this bread and was skeptical that it could be as good as others said.  They were 100% right!  It is great.  I followed one reviewers suggestion and put it in a bread pan, smoothing the surface with a spatula dipped in water.  That worked great.  I just made hamburger buns using forms and they were great also.  Highly recommend!!!

I made this wonderful bread during a snow storm. I didn't have cornstarch so added more flour and it turned out great.

I have made this 3 times.  The 1st time, it  didn't cook through at all and was terribly doughy, but in all fairness, I made some substitutions.  2nd time, I again made some substitutions, and was determined to cook the bread 'til it wasn't doughy, and it turned out so dry that I had to just turn the whole loaf into bread crumbs.  The 3rd time, I made no substitutions - as my last ditch effort to see if this recipe would work at all.  Took the suggestion of another commenter and put the loaf in the oven for about 1 hour at 180 degrees before turning it up to 350 and cooking it for 35-40 minutes.  This time, it was cooked through, soft, and not doughy!  Very excited.  Now to try to make some substitutions so it's more healthy.  ;)  Thanks for sharing!  Glad I didn't give up on this....

This recipe is fantastic! Bread maker settings; sweet loaf, 2lb and medium brown crust. Replaced soy flour with tapioca flour and used brown rice flour instead of white.  Added an extra 1/4 cup of tapioca and rice flour. Turned out great! Yummmmm

I made a loaf of white and a loaf with add-ins jalapenos, green pepper, onion and minced garlic~ similar to another reviewer.  This was my first time making a gluten free loaf of bread from scratch.... no problems with rising and it was surprisingly moist.  The only thing I changed was using corn flour instead of soy flour (not a fan of soy).  I also added a drop of stevia in the white loaf.  I did mix it by hand and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees after the double rise.

Just made my first loaf.  It is still warm, already half gone and with requests to make more!  Very good loaf of GF bread.  Unlike other reviewers, I found I needed to add a little bit more liquid to the recipe to get it to mix up in my bread machine.  (I substituted tapioca starch for the soy flour as many others have done due to soy allergy.)  I wonder if altitude makes a difference for the need to add either more flour or liquid? -- I live in a "high" dry climate area and need to make adjustments for that in some recipes.  I'm not familiar enough with GF baking to know.

Everyone just loved this bread! I did like many people suggested and added almost an extra cup of flour.  The other change I did was to use about 1 1/2 cup of tapioca flour and 2 1/2 cup of Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour instead of all the mix of other flours and potato starch. I let it bake in my bread machine on sweet crust setting and it turned out beautifully. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Just made this twice.  I made some minor changes.  I added a package of gelatin for elasticity, and used millet flour instead of soy as I did not have soy flour.  I used white rice flour, and added a couple of tsp of baking powder to see if it would help with leavening.

The first time, I used the Sweet Dough cycle, but it was almost as long as the regular cycle, and had a second rise - no good for gluten free breads, and I ended up with a very flat topped loaf.  The texture was still pretty good and as my pan is small, it still made a tall enough loaf to make a decent sandwich.  For the second time, I used the Quick Bread cycle, which is about half the time of the regular cycle, and seems to have only 1 rise.  The second loaf also had the baking powder.  It turned out just as tasty, and slightly higher than the first loaf.

The loaf was moist, sliced nicely, and had a mild, slightly sweet flavour.  DH liked the texture of the fresh bread, and it made a nice sandwich that held to slicing and did not crumble apart like previous attempts. That is what DH wants, a bread that does not have a flavour that will overwhelm sandwich fixings, and that won't fall apart when he takes it to work and has it for lunch. If it continues to hold up to handling after a day or two, or after freezing, it may become our go to home made bread.

I followed the "proofing" from jaqui B. Review And made this in the oven. It was perfect and my first gluten free recipe ever!  It's a batter not a dough, but it's perfect when it cooks!

I tried making this recipe to cut down costs of pricey g-free store bread. Ingredients are pricey (xanthan gum was $13) but will make several loaves. This recipe is delish! I love the consistency. It is a very dense, hearty bread. Has just the right amount if sweetness. Gobbled my first loaf, second is in the machine as we speak!
