5 stars   Added garlic. Best meat loaf I've fixed for a while. Try new ones all the time. Very moist and kept its shape. Didn't fall apart when sliced.
Cooked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour.
The sauce was extremely good.
Will use this often

Excellent... I cleaned up some red potatoes and put them around the outside of the meatloaf for the last couple hours and they were yummy... seems to just steam the potatoes... also I put crunched up foil on the bottom of the crockpot and meatloaf on top so any grease would be drained away from meat... works great.

HIgh Five for this one...a tasteful meatloaf. I didn't have mushrooms to add to the meat, but my husband and I didn't miss them.  My only change is to reduce the amount of salt.  Next time I will  use 3/4 tsp.  Nice and tight texture and stayed together when sliced.  I will be making this again.

Very tasty. Didn't change anything in the recipe, cooked it longer (working). Everyone in the house liked it :)

it was definitely a yummy and juicy meatloaf and I would make it again.  I would make it with minced garlic next time, as other reviewers suggested.  It actually stayed together in loaf form, and I didn't expect that!  The main reason I give it only 3 stars is that it could have been more flavorful (although DOUBLE the sauce - it's delish!) but mostly because the recipe calls for sliced mushrooms.  When I mixed the meat mixture together I really felt like I should chop the mushrooms a little more.  But I kept to the recipe (I made it exactly as written.)  The sliced mushrooms were a little too big and looked weird and made the loaf fall apart more than it would have - again - it DID stay together better than I expected, but had the mushrooms been chopped, it would have been MUCH better, texture-wise.  I'd probably recommend 1/2 inch dice for the mushrooms or even, maybe I'll throw 'em in the food processor to get a nice even rough chop.  You could even throw in fresh onion and garlic too (first, before mushrooms) to get a nice homogenous mix before adding to the eggs, milk, breadcrumbs....I'll do that next time.

I have been doing meatloaf in the slow cooker for many years now....it truly is wonderful, moist & tasty.  Turkey loaf is great too.  If you have an issue with removing it from the cooker, just make two double strips of aluminum foil (or 3) and put them in the pot first, leaving enough foil to hang out of the cooker to help remove it to your platter.

I'm a fairly young chef (24) and this is the first time I've ever made meatloaf, since it's one of my boyfriends favorites. We both LOVED IT. I took the advice of other reviews: Add minced garlic (2 cloves), finely chopped onion (1/2 an onion), cup of mushrooms(finely chopped), definitely double the size of the sauce and I omitted the ground mustard & sage (none on hand). I baked it in a loaf pan for an hour, applied the sauce and cooked for another 15 minutes @ 350. 

I served this with cauliflower mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy. Needless to say I did not see leftovers...

Yum! This was absolutely fantastic!!! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this (which is a HUGE plus considering my husband isn't a meatloaf fan, let alone a GLAZED meatloaf fan!). My neighbor and I both like to cook and often share recipes with each other. She recently asked if I had a recommendation for a slow cooked meatloaf. I didn't (the last slow cooker meatloaf I attempted was not to my liking), so she did a search on here and found this recipe. She and her husband liked this a lot, so of course I had to try this out for myself. :) Other than omitting the mushrooms altogether (we hate them) and adding a t of garlic powder, I made no significant changes. I used ground chuck to ensure my meatloaf would remain moist (I was afraid lean sirloin would produce a dry meatloaf and ground round would be too greasy). My slow cooker has a thermometer / probe setting, so I used that to cook my meatloaf (FYI, it took about 4 hours to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F). NOTE: Once cooked, I carefully removed my meatloaf, drained the grease, added it BACK to the slow cooker and proceeded as directed. Homemade mashed potatoes, green beans and crescent rolls perfectly complemented our "homey" meal. Thanks SO much for sharing this easy and delicious meatloaf recipe, NightHawk! I wasn't expecting much, but you sure made a believer out of me. :-)

This didn't sound like it was going to be very good but it is delicious!! It sounded strange to make meatloaf in a slow cooker, but it works and is fantastic! I did not make any changes to the recipe :)

It has now become a family favorite. We don't eat meat loaf any other way in our house.

The only things different I do is I add about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and add the Worcestershire/brown sugar sauce on top when I put the meatloaf on to cook. The sauce seeps through the entire meat loaf makes a great dish superb.

What a wonderful recipe!  I never cooked meat loaf because they always tasted like a lump of ground meat.  This one is scrumptious!  I added 1/2 pound ground pork and minced garlic...flavors we both love.  The ground pork was also added because Hubby's Mom always added it.  Great flavor...great meat loaf!

This was very delicious - there were no leftovers.  I was a little unsure about using a slow cooker but it came out great - although it did burn on the bottom after only 3.5 hours on high so I would probably put this on low for 4-5 hours instead.

Wow - this was AWESOME!  It had so much flavor, and the sauce was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and it was still done within 6 hours of cooking.  Did leave out the mushrooms, but I'm sure they would have tasted great too.  Also, I put it in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes after putting the sauce on just to dry it up a tiny bit.  The only thing lacking slightly was the presentation because the loaf kind of spread out into the shape of the crock pot...but it tasted so good, I don't care!

This is seriously the BEST meatloaf I've ever ate - and I'm a meatloaf connoisseur, I have it every year for my birthday. We made this but instead we used 1/2 lb of turkey and 1 lb of homemade italian sausage. And in the crockpot it's so easy, and it stays firm and together. So delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

This is absolutely delicious. I made a few minor changes, decided to chop the mushrooms instead of slicing. And, like other reviewers, I added garlic to it and cooked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes. It is moist, tasty and my husband raved about it. I didn't have dry mustard for the sauce, so I used dijon. Turned out great. And as several cooks mentioned here, definitely make double the sauce, it is awesome!

This is the first time I have ever given a recipe a 1 star rating.  I like a good meatloaf.  And was concerned when this one added sage as an ingredient but did not list salt or pepper.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I did not like the taste.It was without flavor.  Bland in the extreme.  IMO the sage/beef combination did not taste well.  I tried spreading different condiments to the finished meat.  Nothing worked.   This recipe is very close to most meat loaf recipes sans the sage and the missing salt and pepper.  I can only conclude that the sage does not work with beef or the amount stated is too over powering for the size of this recipe.

This was amazing. This was the first time I've made meatloaf and I will definitely make it again! I used fresh onions instead of dried, added 2 cloves of garlic and used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs because of a gluten intolerance. It didn't hold together as well (Pretty sure it was because of the oats) but it was still great tasting. And I'll double the sauce next time- it was really flavorful!

This recipe is a great starting point. My hubby and I like things highly spiced, so I added 1tsp liquid smoke, and 1tsp Worcestershire sauce to the meat. I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs so I used panko which I had on hand and a pinch of Italian seasoning to duplicate them. I cooked in the slow cooker as per directions, and simply drained off the excess grease and juice before I added the sauce. Also, on the advice of other reviewers I doubled the amount of sauce and am so glad I did because it is amazing! I'm giving 4 stars because without the additional seasoning it would have been quite bland, but my hubby went nuts for it the way I made it.

Delicious!  I diced the mushroom, added extra onion and garlic, no sage and a little spicy sausage.  Threw some fingerling potatoes in for the last 2 hours -- sooo delicious!

We made this recipe without alterations and it turned out moist and tasty. The sauce is outstanding. It's so nice to come home to a ready to eat meal of comfort food! Like anything else, it's important not to over cook your meal as it can cook the flavor right out.  I suggest that you check the meatloaf with a thermometer on the short end of the time range.  My slow cooker has an electronic timer so I can set it to cook on high or low for a set number of hours. Then it goes to the warm setting so it doesn't overcook if I'm not home at the right time.

I made this with the ingredients as written, with the addition of minced garlic as suggested. I think the topping sauce is the BEST,  I guess that is what made it so tasty! Can't wait til tomorrow....COLD MEATLOAF SANDWICHES !!!!!!   However...I did cook it in the oven at 400* for about an hour...  instead of the slow cooker.  This  is my new meatloaf recipe!!!!

Made this tonight for a crowd so made one beef and one turkey and both were a hit!  I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any, but added some finely chopped onion, red bell pepper and garlic.  Delish!

Thanks NightHawk!  Very good meatloaf, I found it to be moist and held together very well.  I did omit the mushrooms, just didn't have any on hand.  A good go to recipe when you know you are going to have a busy day.

We had this tonight for dinner and it was fantastic!  It was unbelievably moist and full of flavor.  I used a fresh, small diced onion instead of the dried minced onion.  I also added some minced garlic.  Like several of the other reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce.  After exactly 5 hours on my crockpot's low setting, the inserted meat thermometer read 160 F and it was done.  This meatloaf does not disappoint, and we're looking forward to the leftovers.

I used ground sirloin so there was hardly any grease, as one reviewer complained about. I cooked it on High the first 2 hours, then Low for another 2 hr (due to time constraints). Hubby liked the sauce. This made a nice, dense meatloaf but not 5-star. Still, was nice not to have to use the oven on a warm day. May try this method again with "my" meatloaf. :)

I used ground sirloin.  I would not make a meatloaf or any other recipe with ground beef in the crockpot unless if it is with ground sirloin....its just too greasy using a ground chuck or hamburger or even round.  Nice recipe for summer in the crockpot!  Thanks.

DELICIOUS!  I only had a pound of ground beef so I changed the servings to 4.  When I chose this recipe I read the ingredients and felt it would really be good.  However, I failed to read "slow cooker"!   Fortunately I didn't read that until after I had mixed everything.  Feeling I had nothing to lose, I formed a loaf in my loaf pan and baked at 350 for one hour.  It was sooo good!  I loved the ketchup mixture and had spooned that over from the start.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make it again, both in the slow cooker or in the oven.  Thank you NightHawk for sharing such a DELICIOUS recipe!

So yummy.  Moist.  I cooked on low for 1 hour, then bumped it to high for 2, then back to low until ready to eat (didn't have the 6 hrs to wait); turned out fine.

This was truly mouth watering! I made some adjustments: I used 1.25 lbs. 4% ground beef, 1 lb. Italian bulk sausage, 1 cup Italian bread crumbs.  Also chopped the mushroom slices, and used 1/2 fresh onion, finely chopped. In addition, I added the sauce right from the start.  Will definitely make again!

I made this in the oven---next time I will double it. I love a cold meatloaf sandwich ! Lots of flavor, only change I made was adding a generous amount of garlic powder. Love the idea of using a liner to make removal (and clean up) easy. The mushrooms were a wonderful addition.

This recipes ranks high on my list. I didn't have time to put it in the crock pot so I baked it at 375* for 1 hour 25 min (meat thermometer read 170). I would suggest doubling the ketchup mixture and using half on top of meatloaf while baking and the other half (heated) for serving.

i made it with 1% fat turkey instead of beef - it was delicious. My husband really liked the firm texture of the turkey and found it was far more flavorful than most ground turkey meals.

Very good recipe,  but I put a metal rack  in the cooker under the meatloaf to keep the bottom from getting soggy,  I also wrap it in bacon and lightly spread ketchup on the top before wrapping it, and then decorate the top with thin slices of green and red pepper.

I love this recipe.  Only meatloaf, I make these days.  I've tried it with ground turkey as well as ground beef.  I like both but the turkey is our favorite.  I only put one egg in when using turkey and also reduce the milk a bit, @ 1/2 cup, because the turkey meat is moister than beef.  I've used dried stuffing mix for the bread crumbs - delicious.

It was one of the better meat loafs I've had or made. The texture was good and it held together well. The mushrooms definitely add to the dish. We really enjoyed the sauce that was put over the top toward the end of the cooking time.
I can see some additions to the meat loaf to make it your own. Such as Bell Peppers, Chopped carrots, Jalapeno peppers, the list goes on and on.
Great job Nighthawk. Will definitely be on my repeat list.

I can never seem to cook meatloaf thoroughly, but this recipe fixed that. I cooked it in the slow cooker first, and then in the oven to brown it more (personal preference) and it came out near perfect. Thanks!

I didn't realize until I went to make this that is was a slow cooker recipe, baked it in the oven at 350° for one hour and it was perfect. I used real onions and finely chopped the mushrooms, and doubled the sauce which was so darn tasty. My husband and son said it was the best meatloaf they've ever had. Thanks Nighthawk.

I've made this dozens of times now. I've made some changes to suit our tastes. First, I have to double the recipe to feed all of us. When I do, I swap out one pound of ground beef for unseasoned ground pork. It gives it a different flavor and texture. I use a whole onion, diced finely, and a handful of mushrooms chopped as small as I can get them while still keeping them large enough to come through against the meat. I use plain panko bread crumbs - a little more than the doubled recipe calls for, put in a couple good shakes of Italian seasoning, a lot of garlic powder, and a little black pepper. I include an extra egg to help bind everything together. No one could believe it came from the slow cooker the first time I made it, which was exactly by the recipe. I've continued experimenting until I got it to satisfy our tastes. I will definitely be cooking this again and again.

I wasn't sure about meatloaf in a slow cooker. Would it brown? What about the texture? My fears were unfounded because it was terrific. I didn't add the mushrooms. That was my only deviation.

This awesome recipe always makes a nice meal.  I  use about 2 lbs ground turkey, and also add a chopped onion.  The mushroom and sage combo make this a stand-out flavor for a meatloaf.

Melt-in-your-mouth Meatloaf Haiku: "Oops, forgot mushrooms! But this was still good meatloaf. Sauce a bit too sweet." I was intrigued by crockpot meatloaf, and while it worked, I don't think it was entirely necessary. I like to run the slow-cooker for 8+ hrs. when I'm away at work and need chow ready w/o any fuss, and for the 5 hrs. that this took, while I was at home anyways, I could've very well just baked it as usual, and the taste and texture wouldn't likely change. It was very moist and juicy, but I thought the sauce on top was a little sweet, so if I made it again, I'd reduce (or drop) the brown sugar, and bake it at 350 for, idk, 45-50 min. or until it was done.

It looked nasty sitting in all that built up grease in the slow cooker. Second, I couldn't find any way to get it out of the pot without it falling apart, so I ended up with more of a meat pile than a meat loaf. I didn't like the texture at all.  It was too mushy and greasy.

The meatloaf itself was bland but the sauce on top was great. I like the Lipton onion soup recipe better
for meat loaf, I think I will stick with that recipe but put this sauce on top.

Never have tried a slow cooked meat loaf.  Followed the recipe but after 5.25 hours it just tasted like over cooked soggy hamburger.  I prefer a low oven cooked meat loaf at 190 degrees for 2 hours and last 3-4 minutes on broiler setting for a nice glaze/crust on the top.  I think the taste would be enhanced with tomato sauce or paste and definitely some additional herbs,..ie. basil and oregano.

This recipe was awesome. Kinda tasted like my Grandmother's meatloaf. Was very skeptical about cooking this in the crockpot, but it turned out wonderful.  Thank you to the people who added a few tips about the tin foil crumpled on the bottom of the crockpot (so the meatloaf doesn't sit in the grease) and the folded strips of tin foil to lift the meatloaf out of the crockpot (made it so easy). The glaze was fabulous (my husband said it tasted better than plain 'ol ketchup, guess I will be making more to use for the side). Thank you, NightHawk, for this outstanding recipe!!

I changed a few things, such as: instead of using sage (I didn't have any), I mixed oregano and parsley half and half to the total measurement for the sage. Instead of onion powder, I diced 1/4 of an onion and mixed it in. I also minced 2 cloves of garlic. To sop up the grease from the meatloaf, I added about a 1 and 1/4 cups of rice (once the meat had browned) and a 1/4 cup of water (I added the water after the rice had soaked up the worst of the grease and only added the water cause the rice wasn't cooked all the way). I let this cook for about 7 hours on low. I served this over the rice and everyone enjoyed it.

I don't know what I did wrong? Followed the recipe but used ground turkey...cooked it for the recommended amount of time. When I went to take it out of the crock pot, it was mush?

We are always looking for away to have a nice meal after coming home from a full day of work.  The slow cooker meat loaf came out very nice.  We add potatoes to the cooker but after cooking all day we still needed to microwave them a for a while to soften them.
I was a little nervous that the texture would not be right but it was perfect. 
I did cook the loaf on two thick onion slices to try to keep it out of the broth.  I put a little of the topping on the loaf in the morning when we turn on the slow cooker to keep the top from drying out.

We will make this again.

I love to cook and try new recipes.  My family raved about this meatloaf. I made a couple of variations to recipe,  I diced the mushrooms, shaped it into several small loaves and cooked it in the oven instead of the slow cooker.  Everyone  should try this recipe and enjoy the compliments.

OMG the smell of this cooking is intoxicating. Made this as written and it was so tasty and moist (unlike my previous sad attempts at meatloaf making). In the numerous times I have made this since, I like to add more spices to jazz it up and depending on what I have handy in my pantry or fridge. I have also rolled the mixture into meatballs and cooked in the slow cooker about 3 hours on low then added my sauce and cooked and additional 1 1/2 to 2 hours on low. Going to use this mixture in some stuffed green peppers soon and I expect the same amazing result.

I've made more meat loafs than I care to remember, but without question, this one ranks right up at the top.  Being able to prepare it quickly and then cook it in a slow cooker was incredible. (I used canned mushroom slices because I didn't have fresh ones on hand.)  I actually got delayed coming home and the meat loaf stayedin the slow cooker on the Low Setting about two hours longer than the recipe specified yett it wasn't overcooked in the least. I couldn't believe it. The title really does say it all:  this meat loaf melts in your mouth no matter how many times you reheat the leftovers!  Five stars, absolutely!

Very good meatloaf. I used seasoned crackers instead of bread crumbs because I had a lot of 'Alabama Fire Crackers' from AR to use up. They worked perfectly in this recipe. I baked at 350° for an hour rather than using the slow cooker. Served this with 'Baked Potato' and 'Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce' from AR.  This is the exact recipe of another meatloaf on this site with the same name.  The only change to this one is the addition of the 1/2 cup of mushrooms.

This recipe was REALLY good.  I have tried it twice now.  The first time I made it exactly as stated.  The second time I added some grated celery and carrot to the mix to sneak in extra veggies.  I should have added an extra egg with the extra ingredients, because it fell apart, but it still tasted FABULOUS.  I'm not a huge meatloaf fan usually, but this will be added to my normal recipe rotation for sure!

Also, my kids request the "sauce" (ketchup, worst. and brown sugar) as a dipping sauce when we have chicken breasts for dinner.  They love it!

my husband and I both thought the topping was way too sweet. Also, although I commend the recipe for being super moist, even after 6 hours, some of the meat was still a bit pink.

Best meatloaf ever!!  My husband said this is the best meatloaf he has ever had! Very moist and flavorful.  Like previous reviews, I added fresh chopped onion and garlic, and doubled the sauce. I also kept in the mushrooms, but chopped them.  Perfect!

This is close to the way that I normally make meat loaf, but I seldom measure anything except in bread baking. The only changes I made was that I used canned mushrooms and 1/2 chopped onion instead of the dried. I also doubled the recipe and used 1 lb. of ground pork and 2 lb. ground beef. I baked the loaf in a 9" x 5" loaf pan at 350 degrees for a little more than 1 hour. The meatloaf was flavorful and very moist. The topping was great and much better than the barbeque sauce that I normally use.

Didn't change anything.... One thing I really liked was how well it sliced the next day when making sandwiches. It didn't fall apart like some of the other ones I fixed.... Very good and I'll make it again.  It's great when I'm gone all day and come home to a ready to eat hot meal!!!

I could not get the meatloaf out of the slow cooker without it falling apart.  Also, no browning of the top.  5 hours in the crock pot wasn’t long enough.  I put it in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.  Flavor is great!!! I will make this again but use the oven.

I made this just as the recipe said.
It was very good,and easy. Just the way I like to cook. Might put a bit more sage in next time, just because I like a stronger flavor in my meatloaf.

I have made this recipe for several years. I usually follow the recipe exactly....however, I lower the cook time to 3 1/2 hours as the meatloaf is done and it’s moister with that change. I also at times top it with our favorite salsa to change it up a bit. Delicious and foolproof - a real home run! Thanks.for sharing.

Excellent!  My kids have always liked Mom's meatloaf the best but this recipe knocks Mom's ol' recipe out of the park!  I made it just as the recipe called for but when I got to the part of mixing the sauce to put over it, I found I was out of ketchup.  So I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  It was still outstanding!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Yes, I will make it again! Husband loved it. So moist! I cooked it on high for 3 hours and 1 hour on low as I was scrunched for time. Turned out wonderful!

I was very happy with this meatloaf. I was also very happy I could use my slow cooker since my oven is useless. Flavor was good, cook time was perfect, texture was meh. The boy was happy.

Meatloaf....is there anything folks are more pick y about?   I loved this recipe and am going to keep it!  The only thing I "had" to do differently is the seasoned breadcrumbs as I didn't have any.  I made my own and added a little "italian" salt free herb blend and it was perfect and who said cut down on the salt?   Oh no, I do not use a lot of salt when I cook and this was seasoned perfectly.   SO....bottom line?  THANK YOU for sharing your fabulous recipe and I am making it again tonight.

Delicious.  I mix, make, and shape the loaf ahead of time and freeze it in a gallon size freezer bag.  When I place it in the crock pot I ball up a bit of aluminum foil, place the foil in the bottom of the pot, and place the loaf on top of the foil.  This allows the grease to drain down while cooking and the loaf doesn't sit in the grease.  I also added garlic and some chopped up onions.  It's super easy to grab out of the freezer on busy days.  Highly recommend.

Very, very Good Meatloaf . 
The sauce was incredible and the meatloaf was delicious.
I made it exactly per the recipe.
Definitely a keeper !
I do think that next time I will use fresh onions, instead of the dried and maybe a touch of fresh garlic also .
Thanks for sharing the recipe !

I just wanted to add my two cents along with the hundreds of others who have.  I made this recipe as stated with the exception of using  1/2 of a diced onion in place of the dried onion and garlic powder, (I like how garlic brings out the flavor in meat.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and boy am I glad I did that or there wouldn't have been enough sauce to cover my meatloaf.  The sauce alone is to die for, boy is it good!  I also half expected this meatloaf to fall apart in the slow cooker but to my surprise it didn't.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and put two strips of foil which I had folded in half twice and laid them in my crock pot before placing my loaf in which made taking my hot meatloaf out of the crock pot so easy.  I like to make a recipe as stated the first time I make it if possible and tweak it to better suit our tastes the next time.  Love the texture this meatloaf had (not mushy and falling apart) but I will add some diced bell peppers and maybe some diced tomatoes to it next time.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  I was a bit concerned about adding sage to my meatloaf, never done that before,  but it doesn't come thru strong in the finished meatloaf, it does however add just the right touch.   Who would have guessed?  Thanks for sharing this wonderful meatloaf recipe.  I think it would bake in the oven real good too.

This is my new meatloaf recipe for life!!!  Crockpot kept it so moist.  And that topping--YUM! Since, I had just 1 lb of beef, I had to add 1/2lb of ground pork.  That's a change I will continue with.  
  (Tip: once cooking is complete and while allowing the meat to 'rest' in the crockpot, prop one end of the crockpot up an inch so that all the grease drains away from the meatloaf.)

I try a lot of different meatloafs and this one is certainly not a favorite.   Sage just doesn't go well with beef.  And as the only added flavor it overpowered it.   I would suggest leaving out the sage and adding Worcestershire sauce,  perhaps garlic, or oregano or even a small amount of tomato sauce  to enhance the beef flavor... but NOT sage.

Meatloaf is my husband's favorite meals. He loved this one. I switched out half the beef for ground turkey. Next time around I might add a little more seasoning to help the turkey. Otherwise a real winner!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I did everything in the recipe except I baked it at 350 for 1 hour. I took it out & put the sauce on and baked for another 15 minutes. The inside was nice and moist while the outside is crispy. I would make it again!

I halved the recipe.  Didn't have any mushrooms.  Added 2 tsps real onion chopped small and added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder because others suggested it. I COOKED THIS IN MY AIRFRYER! 360 degrees for 15 minutes.  Real good!  Like other reviewers, I have made many different meatloaf recipes and a lot of them just aren't right.  I also hate oatmeal in meat, so the breadcrumbs were great.  Will definitely make this again.

Used 1 1/4 lb ground chuck, 2 med eggs, 1/2 cup bread crumbs and milk 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 cup finely diced onions-no sage or mushrooms.  Baked in a loaf fan with 2 pcs of bread to absorb juices.  For 1 1/4 hr.  Doubled the sauce and put  it on the last half hr.  Perfect and delicious.  To check the seasoning after mixing all the ingredients I made a quarter size meatloaf and fried it. Hubby loved it.

I didn't have 'seasoned' bread crumbs so I added a tsp of complete seasoning. I used 1/2 pound of ground pork. Didn't have mushrooms. BEST meatloaf I've ever made. I would give it 10 stars!

Can't give a fair rating, because I used pork sausage instead of beef, added a few stalks of celery to the mixture and added ketchup to the top before placing it in the oven. The taste was ok, next time will add more spices and chili. I would also make more gravy, this only gave 3 spoon fulls.

Fantastic recipe!  I add a pack of Onion Soup Mix in place of the dried onions, garlic, and a few other spices.  I also double the recipe and line the crock pot with raw BACON before I start cooking!  Makes for easy cleanup and a delicious topper.  Perfect for large family gatherings :-D

This was my first time making meatloaf and it was delicious. The sauce is great! I ended up placing it in the oven at 350 covered for 1 1/2hours. I tripled the sauce and added garlic powder. I think next time I'll leave out the mushrooms because it didn't really add any taste but maybe add a little bit of green pepper.

Exceptional, the sauce was really great also.
The loaf itself was pretty greasy from cooking in the  fat the entire time but it could be taken out and drained before adding the sauce on top.
Also would recommend dicing the mushrooms, it says sliced but I think sliced are too large and changes the texture as you are eating which I don't like.

5 stars. I added minced fresh onion and minced the mushrooms as well so they blended well into the meat. I also added a small can of diced green chilies just to add a bit of flavor. It was a wonderful combination of flavors and the fact that it can be done in a slow cooked in just an added bonus!

I took the advice of another reviewer and chopped the mushrooms. Instead of dried minced onion I chopped a half onion. I also baked the meatloaf in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour. I removed it from the oven and then added the glaze. I baked it for another 15 minutes. After removing it from the oven a second time I let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. The meat loaf was very moist and very tasty.

Wow!  So easy and so moist!  My kid-friendly changes: minced the mushrooms (they never knew they were in there!), used onion powder instead of dried minced, ground turkey instead of beef, and dried "poultry seasoning" instead of the sage (which I didn't have).  It turned out fantastic!  Thanks!

Yum!!! I mixed ground turkey & 95% lean ground beef, panko bread crumbs, onion flakes, garlic powder & lawry's seasoned salt & a dash of worcestershire sauce.  No milk.  Mixed it all up and placed in crockpot coated with non stick spray.  Definitely recommend doubling batch for the glaze.  Yum!!!

Very moist and tasty! I followed the recommendation in the magazine and cooked it at low for 2.5 hours when it reached 160 degrees. My children liked this meatloaf and they are very picky.

I made this meat loaf yesterday-and my family loved it! I seasoned the meat a few hours ahead and put it back into the fridge.
Once I was ready to bake it.. I added the main ingredients. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I crushed corn flakes and substituted it into the recipe. Tip: make your sauce ahead of time, so that when the meat loaf is ready to be brushed with the sauce, your sauce is ready.
I added paprika to my sauce as well:)
I served it with steamed broccoli.
Enjoy!

Made this today.  It was perfect and a big hit with 4 adults.  Served with Chef John's Cottage Fries.  One thing--I had no sage so I used Italian seasoning.

Meatloaf was very moist and had a great flavor.  Next time will make some additional sauce and heat up seperately so can be added if desired.

This was a very easy recipe that I could throw in the slow cooker and not worry about it.  I did not add the mushrooms (because I didn't have any), I added minced garlic, Adobo seasoning, seasoned Panko instead of bread crumbs, and yellow mustard instead of dried.  I tried to use what I had in the house.  I was pressed for time so I turned the slow cooker to high for about 4 hours and 45 minutes (could have been ready earlier though) and the meat loaf turned out very moist.  My husband and I both enjoyed it, but we agreed that we would leave out the rubbed sage next time...because it left almost too much of an earthy or odd flavor to the meat loaf.  I also doubled the ketchup sauce for this.

I loved it, my husband said "this is wonderful".  Added a chopped shallot and some garlic powder to the ground beef mixture.  Followed someone's advice and crinkled tin foil on the bottom of the crock pot so the the meatloaf wasn't stewing in the grease.  That was a great tip!  Turned out very well, the loaf held together so it's in my "regular rotation" folder.

This was a very nice meatloaf!  I realized I didn't have mushrooms so they were omitted - will add next time (and maybe garlic as suggested).  I had to use Panko crumbs (no bread crumbs).  Made in loaf pan in oven at 350 for just over an hour (ran short of time - so no crock pot).  The flavours were really nice and it was sliceable!  Most just fall apart.  Thanks!!!

The meat was good, I cooked it in the oven in a loaf pan at 350 for 1 hr and it turned out perfect. The sauce was a little too sweet for our liking, if I make that part again I will cut the brown sugar in half or more. 

This is similar to my dad's recipe where there is 1 pound beef and 1/2 pound pork. It works out if you don't have any ground pork on hand. I will be making this again.

Best meatloaf I have ever had!!!! 
I left out the mushrooms and sage and replaced the onions with Lipton onion soup packet because that is all I had.  After a few hours in the crock pot I put it in the oven for an hour   This is the only meatloaf I will make for now on.

Flavor was really good!  And maybe it's because I don't cook in the crock-pot much, but there was so much liquid and fat simmering all around that I had try to drain it without the whole thing falling out.  Did anyone else have this problem?

My husband liked this (although the texture wasn't firm enough for him). My kids and I did not care for the flavor. But I did appreciate the ease of the slow cooker, and the fact that it all held together, which surprised me. :)

This was a great meatloaf!  I will be making it again and again.  The glaze is excellent and it was so easy to make.  I did have some issues with the amount of grease in the bottom of my slow cooker so I drained it halfway through cooking.  I cooked this about 7 hours and it was still tender and juicy.

I really like meat loaf but was never satisfied with the  I made, until now. This is the best meatloaf I've ever tasted. Including the leftover sandwich I just ate for lunch. Only thing I did different was change the serving size to eight so I could use two pounds of meat. Thanks, the recipe is now safely tucked away in my recipe box.

Very good.  I made it easier - I mixed the sauce ingredients right into the loaf - didn't put anything on top.  I slow cooked two hours on high, then four hours on low.  It set up nicely.  Kids loved it.

AWESOME!  I used ground turkey, spiced bread crumbs (therefore I didn't add any more spices at all not even salt and pepper), no mushrooms (hubby hates them), used rice milk (lactose issues) and added chipotle powder to the meat (2 tbs) and chipotle salsa to the sauce!!!!   I also used a meat thermometer but opted to use the suggested cooking time per the recipe of 5 hours ... This is the best and moistest turkey meatloaf I've ever had least of all made and the easiest thing to make ever!

With the left overs, we fried the slices to brown the sides ... even more AWESOME if that is possible :0  I'd give it more stars if I could.

Hands down THE BEST meatloaf I have EVER had!! The only adjustments I made were I used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup Half n Half. I also used 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.

Made this tonight for dinner...my family absolutely LOVED it!  Per other reviews  added some garlic powder to the mixture.  Im thinking next time maybe I will add a packet of dry soup mix.  We used 92 or 93% lean meat for it.  Your family will love this!

Delicious! I did add a little ketchup & worcestershire into the meatloaf- then when it was almost done I just squirted ketchup on top. Yum!

My meatloaf loving family gave this one 5 stars. They've loved every one I've ever made! This was nice and moist and very tasty. I would have preferred the sauce mixed into the meat instead of on top but I still thought it was good. I was disappointed that mine stayed in a loaf shape but cracked in the middle and fell apart as I lifted it out of the crock. No one cared though; we just ate it in chunks instead of slices. I liked being able to cook it in the crock pot all day so finishing up dinner is so easy.

Really liked the recipe. Followed it to the letter except we did not have mushrooms so substituted green pepper and added garlic as some suggested. Will definitely make it again. The crock pot cooking made it easy and kept from heating up my house on an already hot summer day. Thanks for the recipe.

Meatloaf was mushy.  I turned up heat & cooked on high which helped a little.  Never make it again!

This recipe is so easy to make and turns out really moist. I wish there was a little bit more flavor from spices but it isn't a bad meatloaf and the crock pot convenience is an added bonus. I've made this three times now and on days when I don't have time to mess around in the kitchen or we are having people over after church, it's the perfect comfort food.

Because I have an almost 8 year old son the mushrooms or sage didn't go over well.  He or my husband didn't like the sage in it so I think I will do without these 2 items next time.  I usually use just ketchup on top but this mixture was different so I think next time I will use my 'old faithful' recipe with this topping.

I normally don't like meat loaf, this one however, I LOVED. It's moist has none of that off taste I find ground beef has. I also didn't use mushrooms as I'm not fond of them.

Fabulous and easy! My husband is a meatloaf fanatic and he thought it was very good. I cooked it in the oven because I was short on time but followed the recipe. I especially liked the glaze on top.

I was a little apprehensive about cooking meatloaf in the slow cooker, but this was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the mushrooms (because I don't like them).  It was a hit with the family and I loved that it came out cooked all the way through without being burnt or well-done at the top.  It was cooked evenly through out the meat loaf.  This is definitely going in the rotation!  Thanks for a great recipe.

The meatloaf was excellent.  I took the advice of others and diced the mushrooms and used fresh diced onions as well.  It was very good.  I gave it four stars though becuase the sauce was too sweet.  I doubled the sauce and only used 1tbspn of brown sugar and it was still too sweet.  I prefer a savory sauce.  Next time I will use a different sauce, but the meatloaf was very good.

The meat loaf was excellent!  Wouldn't change a thing about it for me.  I loved the sauce as well.  Mu husband, however, liked the meat loaf, but not the sauce.  He said he would rather have plain ketchup.  I am keeping the recipe and will take out his portion plain.  Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe.

This was great!  Other than the loaf spreading out in the Crock, it was the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I doubled the receipe and I also added garlic after reading other reviews. There were no leftovers! I would advise to make extra sauce and to put the loaf into a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes just to dry it out a little.  Fantastic dish!

I think this was the best meat-loaf I've ever made and even though I made one big change it still came out wonderfully.  I doubled the recipe which meant it was never going to fit in my crock pot, so I put it in a glass baking dish, covered it with foil and baked it in a 350 degree oven for two hours.  After that I added the sauce on top and baked it for an additional 30 minutes and it was so juicy, so moist, so yummy.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent meatloaf!  I did not change a thing except being that I did not have enough time to cook it in the slow cooker, I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes.  Can't wait to try it in the slow cooker next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is very good.  I omitted the mushrooms because I didn’t have any but will make it again with mushrooms.  I added minced garlic and doubled the sauce per the other reviews. Definitely double the sauce.  Hubby liked it so will make it again.  I was leery about cooking meatloaf in a crock pot but it works!  Very moist; not burnt.  Only thing is the grease collects underneath the meat so I would recommend taking the meatloaf out of the crock before layering the sauce on.  Finish in the oven for 15 minutes to heat the sauce through.  Not the best I’ve ever had but pretty darn good!

Delicious!!  Per other reviewers, I skipped the mushrooms and doubled the amount of sauce.  I haven't had all that many meatloaves, but this was hands-down the best.  Will definitely be making again.

It was delicious as it is.  I like the idea of extra sage in it. Makes a wonderful addition. I did substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs. I used to do this so it be more nutritious for my family. Delicious recipe. I would not change anything. Being in the crockpot cleanup is a breeze. I used groundround and Angus ground beef. It was really lean. There was no grease in the bottom

Fantastic Recipe! The most delicious, moist meatloaf I've ever had!  I did add diced Onions, minced garlic and Worcestershire to the meat mixture. I also omitted the sage.  This is definitely a keeper!

Instead of 1 and 1/2 lbs of ground beef, I used 1 lb ob burger and 1/2 lb of sausage.  This is the best meat loaf ever!!

Easy to make.  It was very moist.  However, mine didn't turn out quite as solid as the picture shows.  I used 90% lean beef.  The glaze was really tasty.  My husband told me next time make extra glaze.  Will definitely make again.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and eliminated the mushrooms (my husband does not like mushrooms).  I cooked the meatloaf in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Really has a great flavor!!  Will be making this again!!

We were staying in a time-share in Scottsdale, Arizona when I made this.  Delicious!  I'm always trying out different meatloaf recipes.  I made this dish along with Chef John's mushroom gravy.  Also delish!  I did not change anything in either recipe with the exception of adding fresh minced garlic to the meatloaf.  I also baked the meatloaf in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour as other members suggested.  I wish I would have had aluminum foil which would have made my cleanup easier.  This is a do-over for me and the meatloaf did not fall apart as my meatloaf sometimes will do.

I've made this many times, and it's delicious. (I didn't care for having the mushrooms, so I left those out after the first time.) My exceptionally picky husband loves it, too.

I had to adapt this to my low carb and gluten free way of eating and this melt-in-your-mouth meatloaf was easy to make some minor substitutions. I substituted crushed pork rind for the bread crumbs,and mixed red,yellow and green peppers because I didn't have mushrooms.  I used a mixture of ground pork and ground beef to make it more hearty.I forgot to add milk but it didn't seem to make much of a difference because this meatloaf was still moist and delicious. I did substitute brown sugar for a brown sugar substitute because I like to keep the carbohydrates as low as I can. Finally,I was short on time,so I baked in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour. The sauce was really good and I brushed it on top before baking the meatloaf,so I really didn't see the need to double it.

This was a great recipe and I'm glad I read the previous reviews. I used diced onions and  I drained the crock pot of grease during the last half hour of cooking and added twice as much sauce. The meatloaf turned out great. Would make this again... :p

Really liked this one. My husband said that he enjoyed it as much if not more than my usual meatloaf. I didn't have ground beef, but had ground turkey and pork in the freezer. It was very good and lean. Will definitely make again and put the garlic in the recipe.

Moist and flavorful, added minced garlic and did not add the mushrooms, will increase the sage and add parsley in future, a little too salty for my taste and sauce a little too strong, would decrease the ketchup next time and up the brown sugar.  Otherwise a definite keeper.

First time ever making meatloaf in a crockpot,  now I think I may never make it any other way again! Tender, moist and so flavorful!  Besides doubling the recipe I made a few changes. I put sliced Vidalia onions on the bottom  of the crockpot to help with the meatloaf not burning. I added diced vidalia onions and green and red bell peppers to it, as well. The only change I made to the sauce was to add a bit of apple cider vinegar. I just felt like it would add a great dimension, and I was right! Thanks for an AWESOME , easy recipe!

This is my go to recipe for meatloaf, it's always moist and delicious. I also put potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the pan, set the loaf on top so they cook in the juices. I work later than my husband so he can just come home to a fully cooked delicious meal! I omit the mushrooms as the boys aren't fans, and adjust the amount of milk, breadcrumbs, and egg when I only have a pound of meat. I also make extra "sauce" for the top. I actually just put it on from the beginning so it adds extra flavor. Now I have a ninja foodi, I also air fry the top so you get that nice crust before eating.

The sauce is the bomb!  I always make double and put some on the table to add to the meat as you're eating it.   Hubby loves it - I think it's on his top 10 list of dinners.

I usually try to make a recipe "as is" the very first time so I can give it an accurate rating.... but my 3 year old has been pretty picky on the veggies front so I finely diced the mushrooms instead of slicing them. Recipe turned out great, everyone loved it! Definitely held together and definitely was melt-in-your-mouth. Thanks for a great recipe :)

This meat loaf was so delicious.  The only exception was I did not put it into a slow cooker.  I baked it.  I put it into a glass loaf pan covered with foil and baked it 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Then put the topping on and cooked for 10 to 15 minutes more uncovered.  It came out perfect and stayed together when I sliced it.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this again.

My family loves this.  My 75 year old grandma says it's the best she's ever had!! I agree with adding some garlic, and I play around with the sauce. This 5 star review is coming from a vegetarian who hates to touch meat, and it's still a family favorite!!

I made a kosher version by swapping the milk for water and it came out moist and delicious. I also used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and in the glaze used deli mustard and skipped the worcheschire sauce. I baked it in the oven for 1.5 hours. Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this exactly as written.  I feel as if it would have been a bit better if I had baked it in the oven. The glaze didn't cook down at all in the slow-cooker.  It was as if it just had ketchup on it.  I do think that I would prefer this with peppers and onions.

I followed the directions but I cooked in a meatloaf pan in 350 degree oven for an hour and then put the sauce on and cooked for another 15 minutes.  It was fantastic and makes great leftover meatloaf sandwiches

I was looking for mushrooms to make this with when I came. upon a small package that the supermarket had made up consisting of approx. 1 large sliced mushroom, chopped mixed sweet peppers and about a half cup of chopped red onion, all together. I took this package home instead of just mushrooms and chopped these ingredients up much finer, making the rest of the meatloaf as per the recipe, except the 3/4 cup of milk was partly 1/2 & 1/2. This one of the best meatloaves I've ever had hot. It was awesome! But the story got even better! I left it to go cold in the fridge overnight, sliced it up and had it on sandwiches the next day with cheddar cheese and some mayo! Wow! It was so  awesome served like this, that I actually regretted having it hot!! (Yes, hot was extremely good too) You should change the name to "Melt-in-your-mouth Sandwich Loaf" to give people the right idea!!

The sauce is very good but additional seasoning is needed for the meat.  Next time I will try adding garlic and onions as others have suggested.

I was so surprised how good this was. I made it just as written and It held together which surprised me. I even used 20% ground beef. We both loved it and it was enough for two meals for two people. This I’ll make again.

This was the easiest, moistist and best tasting recipe that I've tried. I baked this in the oven, though, 90min at 350, spooned topping on then back in oven for 10-15 min. The only ingredient I added was some garlic powder otherwise I followed the recipe...except I didn't use the crockpot either.

When my husband says that something is ‘solid’ I know that it is a winner. I did not have sage so I tossed in a few shakes of Poultry seasoning and added some minced garlic. I did cut back on the salt,and it was great. The glaze brings it to the next level.  Great recipe!

I would have given this a 5 but with the seasoned breadcrumbs and 1tsp salt, I found the taste too salty.  Reading reviews, I also added garlic.   I’d make it again but with 1/2 tsp salt OR unseasoned bread crumbs.  Very easy to make!   Terrific comfort food and nice cold the next day in sandwiches.

I will definitely make this again but I must admit I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I used just under a half lb of angus ground beef so I omitted one egg and my family doesn’t do mushrooms so i made them on the side for myself. I also added a chopped onion, garlic powder, and black and red pepper for spice. Instead of making the sauce I incorporated those ingredients into the loaf and baked it at 450 for 10 minutes then reduced it to 425 for about 50 minutes until it read 160 on a meat thermometers. I made a brown gravy and my mushrooms to serve alongside. It had a really good flavor that i hope i can duplicate.

I wasn’t sure how a meatloaf would turn out being cooked in a crockpot, but I gotta say it was really good & a hit with my family.  I followed the recipe except I used fresh onion because I didn’t have dried onions. Pealing & dicing fresh onion created a little more work,  but the recipe was still easy . This is a winner for me because it’s delicious & easy!

Rodney.....I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your posting a meatloaf that doesn't have oats as a binder.  I love meatloaf but I think the addition of oats changes the texture.  Some tricks that I learned from an elderly friend is the addition of some vegetables.  She had a very picky daughter and had to resort to a few tricks.  A small amount of grated carrot, some diced green pepper, onion and celery and she substituted V8 juice for the milk.  My family loved the additions.  

My mother didn't like meatloaf so she never made it when I was growing up.  I had a great aunt that made the most wonderful meatloaf and I remember hers had onions and green pepper.  I wish I had been old enough to ask for the recipe.

This was definitely one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made! The only thing I changed was I left out the sage mainly because I didn't have any but I don't think it really needed it anyway. Like many other people that reviewed this recipe I also doubled the delicious glaze so there'd be some extra. And I raised the meatloaf on a little foil covered rack on the Crock-Pot too so it wouldn't sit in any grease. I will definitely make this recipe again and again. I served it tonight with mashed potatoes and peas.

Great recipe! Minced the mushrooms instead of sliced, minced a quarter cup of red onion, and one tablespoon green pepper finely minced.  Used tomato sauce instead of milk, and 2 teaspoons sage. Added 3 cloves chopped garlic. Placed 5 julienne strips of green pepper on outside of loaf before cooking. Turns out great!

My favorite meatloaf recipe! I did with and without the Worcestershire sauce (don’t always keep it around) and it’s great either way. I cut out beef & pork from my diet a few years ago and this was the only thing I really missed! Just tried making it with ground turkey and I’m pleased to say it’s still delicious! Also pleased my three little ones (literally an impossible task up until this meal).

I baked this in the oven because I ran out of time.  The meatloaf was so mushy that it fell apart.  And the sauce was not that good either.  I was worried about making it with milk as I thought the ratio between the milk and bread crumbs wasn't right.  The only way I can think of to salvage this is to fry it in a skillet, and pour a bunch of mushroom gravy over it

This recipe was delicious!  The only substitution I made was using ground venison instead of beef.  The seasonings and mushrooms kept the meat moist and delicious.  Will definitely make this again!

This was an ok meatloaf. I didn’t add anything so followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn’t call it melt in your mouth however it was tasty. I will probably look for another slow cooker meatloaf recipe.

Love this meatloaf.  I do add a few things like onion, green pepper and garlic. I always leave out the mushrooms cause nobody likes them. I always double or triple the sauce it is amazing the whole family uses a side of it for dipping. I don't actually make it in the crockpot I make balls and put them in a cupcake pan. I love this recipe. My go to meatloaf recipe. I have also made it without the extras and still just as good.

I make as written except I have subbed fresh onion (and I have used dried). I have cooked in a slow cooker and at 350 degrees in the oven for 1 hr- 1 hr 15 mins in a loaf pan. So good. My family asks for this.

I'm sure this recipe would have been perfect as is.  Because we have allergies, I tweaked it and my family still loved it!  I used Ian's gluten free Italian breadcrumbs, left out the milk (because it seemed moist enough, but I used duck eggs which are larger and have more yolk to white ), and also left out the brown sugar from the sauce since the ketchup is sweet enough.  We did not miss the gluten, dairy, or extra sugar and this will be a keeper.  Per other's suggestions, I did chop the mushrooms and added garlic in the food processor.  I left a small portion without the breadcrumbs or sauce (for me who is allergic to everything). My simpler meatloaf was delicious too, though my husband said his was better. Thank you for a great (and adaptable ) recipe!

We loved this recipe!  I left out the sage cuz this gives hubby heartburn.  I also used real onion and minced it.  I put the sauce on top and turned up the crock pot to high during the last hour.  I never would have thought meatloaf in the crock pot would be so good.  Many thanks for your recipe!!

Wonderful recipe! I made it with 4 lb 50/50 ground pork/beef, increasing other ingredients proportionally. Cooked in a large, foil-lined crockpot with temperature probe set at 165 F, then left on warm for 1/2 hour. Removed from pot and reserved flavorful drippings.

The meatloaf mixture itself is good which I will definitely make again.  
However, I won't make the sauce again.  I think the ground mustard ruined it.  It gave it a bad taste and we actually threw it out.  Next time I'll use the sauce from another recipe that we really like.

Made it for a family dinner for nine. Adjusted the recipe to serve 9 and there wasn't a crumb left over. Everyone loved it and wanted more. Held together great and next time, I will double the delicious sauce! Thank you for this winning recipe. My husband said that it was the best meatloaf he has ever had!

Easy, would double or even triple the sauce.  I only had 1# ground beef so added extra mushrooms, delicious, but could have used a clove or two of garlic. Have already shared and will make again!
Update: I make this about once a week, it is so easy. Always add 2-3 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp Colemans dry mustard, and a TBsp of original Worcestershire sauce. Hubs and kids absolutely love it!

The whole family loved it! 
I did add a few extra things (minced garlic, paprika, garlic powder), and skipped the mushrooms! Even substituted regular mustard for the groud mustard, and it was still great! So much flavor!!!

Forgot to get mushrooms, so will have to try those next time.  I did use garlic salt  and some pepper; also cooked 1/2 lb more meat for a few more hours on low in my slow cooker due to my work schedule.  It was very good and I didn't have to use my oven!  It was a humid, hot summer day, but I was hungry for meatloaf and mashed potatoes ( we always have glazed carrots the first night and sandwiches the next).

nice flavor but be careful with the salt.   seasoned bread crumbs have a lot, and the extra teaspoon of salt may be too much.      Holds together, slices nicely, delicious sauce.

Diced up the mushrooms, used 1/2 onion diced (or more), & added 2 cloves of garlic (minced). Sautéed those in olive oil & added to mixture. Made individual loaves in mini loaf pan. Took about 20 min to bake on 350. added sauce for last 10. made extra sauce for serving but left out mustard.

I added some panko breadcrumbs instead of regular and threw a few hits of Worcestershire and Steak Sauce into the meatloaf. Aside from that, no changes. Served it as sandwich meat with all the fixins' on fabulous rolls with homemade barbecue sauce and mayonnaise on the side. Cole slaw rounded out the meal. It made a fine 4th of July party.

Delicious! Fixed it in the slow cooker. Great texture and taste. Cooked as listed except replaced the mushrooms with green pepper. Some might prefer less salt, but was perfect for us.  I will make it again for sure!

I was surprised when this recipe came out of the crock pot in one piece.  I used 1/2 lb of pork sausage w 1lb of ground chuck.  On the glaze, I didn’t have catsup, so used barbecue sauce, mustard and a splash of liquid smoke.  The meatloaf had a very smooth texture which I prefer. Next time I will skip the mushrooms.

I added chopped onions and minced garlic but otherwise followed recipe as is.  I baked it in the oven for 40 mins covered on 350 degrees. I spread the sauce on top and baked uncovered for 20 more minutes.  This meatloaf is divine!   Will definitely make again.

Quite tasty and moist. I changed around the glaze, used 1 tsp minced garlic and some honey with the ketchup for a honey-garlic glaze. Also added garlic, chopped onions, and parsley to the loaf itself. The glaze doesn't seem to have set long enough (or maybe that's because I changed it), and there was a fair bit of liquid produced. I think next time I'm going to try with ground beef that's already been browned. Nonetheless, quite tasty!

Edit: Attempt with browned ground beef did not hold together, even with the addition of a third egg. Still moist and tasty, though!

I would give this 5 stars even if I didn't make any changes. Just added garlic and I chopped the mushrooms. Boyfriend said to save that recipe!  :)

The best part about this recipe was the sauce. It was delicious. Otherwise, it was just so-so and didn't really have all that much flavor. Although we like mushrooms, they didn't work for us at all. I probably won't make this again.

Great recipe. I liked how the consistency turned out. I added a bit of steak sauce, which I think made the flavor a little stronger.

Very good! Left out the mushrooms and added minced garlic. Also cooked in the oven for about an hour at 350- my whole family loves this recipe.

I made this loaf almost exactly as written however, I did put brown sugar in the meat mixture as well. Very tasty loaf! Mine fell apart in the pot and was done 45mins before the cook time.

Not my favorite meatloaf, but pretty good.  I used fresh minced onions instead of dried and sauteed them with the mushrooms (chopped finely) and a little garlic and red pepper before adding  to the meat mixture.  I found that the meat was extremely soggy when I shaped it into a loaf (maybe too much milk?) so I needed to add another 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to keep it together.  It still seemed pretty loose so I opted to cook it in a cast iron pan in the oven, at 350, covered for 1.5 hours.  Glazed for 5 minutes in the oven with the sauce.  If I make this again I would cut down on the milk and skip the sage - possibly even eliminate the milk if I was making in the slow cooker.

Believe it -- incredibly moist meatloaf in the slow cooker! *And* it keeps its shape when sliced -- my Holy Grail for meatloaf. I used ground turkey, subbed in half of a Liptons "beef and onion" dry soup and a simple glaze of ketchup, balsamic vinegar and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. It was even fantastic the next day! Be sure and spray your cooker with baking spray. This is 5-star meatloaf -- and so simple!

I doubled it and used 50/50 beef and venison. I used the drippings from the crock to make the gravy.  My kids like venison jerky, but are finicky with it in recipes.  They couldn't tell it was in there.  The sage masked the gaminess.  I can see several variations that would be good, but the as is in seasonings works very well.

True to its name this meatloaf melts in your mouth. I increased the ingredients since I was working with almost 3lbs of meat. Chopped the mushrooms as per previous reviews. Will try adding garlic to see of I notice a difference next time. Also skipped the sage since I didn't have any. This will be my go to meatloaf recipe.

I'm always on the lookout for great slow cooker recipes, and this is one of them. The only change I made was to mix the ketchup, ground mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into the loaf itself (omitting the brown sugar). I did this because my family is opposed to anything with visible ketchup on it, though they like the taste if they don't know it's there ;) A mom's gotta do what a mom's gotta do. The leftovers make the best fried meatloaf sandwiches I've ever tasted. Thank you for sharing!

EDIT:  I've made this many times and it's always great and now I have a question - I want to make it and freeze it so that I can take it with us in our RV when we go on the road.  Any ideas how to thaw and reheat it as I won't have my slow cooker with me?

I haven't made meatloaf in like 100 years so used this recipe - I didn't have fresh mushrooms but I had dried so I used those instead, otherwise made it exactly per instructions.  It was really good!  Good flavor, nice and moist.  I would make it again.

It was good, but I don't see the advantage of making it in a slow cooker.  I've been making meatloaf in the oven (in my covered "Corning Ware"  2-1/2 qt. casserole) for many years.... and it's always been tender & juicy.  I did however, LUV the addition of sage in this recipe.  I always add a large clove of finely minced garlic, and I use REAL diced onion (not dried).  I also like to add some diced red bell pepper for flavor, & a 'tiny bit' of sweetness in my meatloaf.  Since we don't like the traditional sticky & sweet meatloaf topping which is very popular, I top our meatloaf (thinly) with ketchup, and then sprinkle "French's" dried onions on top.

The meatloaf itself is very good. I was surprised how well it kept its shape! I used fresh chopped onion instead of dried and chopped the mushrooms. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste though. I think next time I'll either reduce the amount of brown sugar or leave it out all together.

I was surprised it held it's shape and wasn't mushy. The recipe itself is very similar to my own, so I knew it would taste good. But what I don't understand is people rating and reviewing a slow cooker recipe, yet are using an oven or convection oven to cook it. That makes no sense.

Yep! it truly was melt in your mouth. A light easy to make crock pot meatloaf with a yummy kinda glaze on top. My meatloaf is useably so heavy because I put sausage & a whole lot of ingredients in it. This was so simple & tasty.

I added some smoked paprika to it, only because I like some heat and smokiness, but that's all.  My sister and her husband were expecting it to come out soggy, but of course, it was awesome!!  Yes, I will be making it again many times!  Thank you for such an easy and wonderful recipe!!

Very good. I made a larger batch with 2# of hamburger and 1# of seasoned pork sausage. I also made it in the oven. Otherwise I made it pretty much the same.  My husband is raving about how delicious this is. He said I can make it once a week if I want to. That won't happen but he really likes it too.

I didn't make any changes and I cooked it in a crockpot.  I folded up a wide strip of foil across the bottom of the pot and up the sides making a lift to get it out of the pot without crumbling the loaf.  It was moist and wonderful tasting.  I will definitely make this again  rotating it with my 60 year old family favorite.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I increased the total meat to 2 lbs. and use 1 lb. of Italian sausage. Otherwise no changes. My problem with this recipe is using the slow cooker. Depending on your situation 5 1/2 hours is either too short or too long. If your desire is to fix before you go to work and have it ready when you get home. 5 1/2 hours is not long enough. I would suggest you just make it ahead of time and have it in the frig ready to bake when you get home.

I really liked this, and was amazed at how nicely a meatloaf made in a slow cooker can be. I'd expected it to fall apart (as some of mine baked in the oven have been known to do), but this held together perfectly, and sliced like a dream. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning as I do to all Beef dishes.

Am always looking out for meatloaf recipes and have decided this is a keeper.....added garlic and omitted mushrooms (only because hubby won't eat them). Was nice hot but enjoyed cold next day in a sandwich.

This meatloaf was delicious and very flavorful. I have to admit, I'm quite surprised it stayed in the loaf form. I expected it to fall apart. It was a savory recipe and was a huge hit with my children. I'll definitely make this again. It's so nice putting something in the slow cooker and not having to think about it until it's ready.

Tasty, even without the sage used 2 cloves of garlic instead. Will make it again. One of the best meatloaf recipes that I have tried and I try new ones all the time.

Made a few changes such using 1/2 lb of pork instead of all beef and fresh onions vs minced.  Tried cooking in crock pot atop tinfoil (another reviewer suggestion, but it fell apart in the cooking process).  Put it in a bread pan and convection roasted it for 45 minutes at 350. Poured off most of the grease  and added the topping and roasted for another 15 minutes.  Had doubled the topping as a lot of reviewers suggested, but I think it was too much (wife liked it that way).

The flavor of this meatloaf is fantastic.  I always want to find a meatloaf that doesn't fall apart and I am sorry to say this one did.  Also 5 hours in my slow cooker would have been way to long ...I cooked it on low for 2 1/2 hours and it was done

It was excellent! The only changes I made were no mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand and I added crumbled blue cheese to the center.

I did make some changes.  I used no added salt tomato sauce and it turned out really great. I really loved the sauce, I used  a small can.  also added 1/2 cup of oatmeal, I always use that in my meatloaf and do not use breadcrumbs.  I enjoyed using the mushrooms.  Thanks for the great recipie.

I cannot CANNOT eat anything with tomato sauce, ketchup, etc without experiencing SEVERE heartburn and upset stomach. I made this with brown gravy, used dried beefy onion soup mix and canned mushroom slices. It was GREAT.

I did not make any changes.  Best Meatloaf ever!!  And, I have tried many recipes.  If you do not like mushrooms, don't worry because they melt and other than being moist you would not even know that they are in the recipe.

My husband dislikes tomato sauced based meatloaf but loved this one.  I did follow others suggestions and added garlic.  I also sauteed the garlic, onions and mushrooms along with the sage before mixing.  Next time I plan on cutting the mushrooms smaller.

It was good and it holds it 's shape when you cut it...but it is still just meat loaf.  The sauce/topping was great and I doubled that.  Didn't have a slow cooker so baked at 350 for a while.  Slow cooker may make it more moist but the flavor is still just meatloaf.  I put the garlic in the sauce because I forgot to put it in earlier.

This was the first time I tried a meat loaf in the slow cooker. I don't know why I haven't tried it before. One of the best meat loaf recipes I've ever tried. Easy to make and came out incredible. I'll be using this one a lot.

Impressive! I did chop up fresh mushrooms, onion and garlic. The meatloaf stayed formed in the crock and had really good flavor. My house smelled amazing ??

This meatloaf was a big hit with my family. I increased the overall recipe by 25% (in hopes of having some leftovers), left out the mushrooms (so my daughter would eat it), and doubled the recipe for the  ketchup/brown sugar sauce. It was very easy, incredibly moist, and most surprisingly, it held its shape in the slow cooker. I'm definitely making this again.

The only change I made was using fresh chopped onion, because I didn't have dried onion on hand. I prepared the loaf and sauce and refrigerated overnight, turned crock pot on in the morning on low for 7.5 hours. Turned out perfect - kept its shape, moist and flavorful. Got a lot of compliments on the sauce! Will definitely make this again!

I made this the other night for dinner.  Based on other reviews I also added some garlic and cooked it in the oven.   I put it on for 350 degrees for an hour and the middle still was a little pink.   I never saw a meatloaf recipe with mushrooms before but it was good.   My husband didn't like the sauce--I thought it was ok.   It does stay moist.

This is a great recipe and the best meatloaf I've eaten in a long time.  I've made this recipe twice already-once using 85% fat free ground chuck and the other time using 90% fat free Angus sirloin.   The 85% ground chuck yields the most flavorful results for this slow cooking method.

I made this meatloaf according to the recipe and I would call it good but not outrageously so.  I doubled the sauce/glaze so I could have extra on the side.  Did very well in the slow cooker.  Slices well, especially next day when everyone wants meatloaf sandwiches.

Added garlic as other reviewers suggested.  Also, crumpled up aluminum foil to put under the meatloaf in the cooker so grease could drain as it cooked.  Strips of foil under the loaf also facilitated its removal. BEST tasting meatloaf ever!  The sauce is good, but it doesn't even need the sauce, it's so good alone.  Also, I diced the mushrooms instead of slicing.  This helped to disguise them so one non-mushroom lover in the family would eat it.  This recipe is a keeper.

Really melts in the mouth and yet cuts really well. Didn't use mushrooms as do not like but was lovely.  Put in slow cooker for 6 hours in the end. Every one loved it including the fussy 3 year old!

It was a yummy, easy meal.  I used recommendation from others to use the foil to lift out....worked perfectly.

Also doubled the sauce...definitely a good thing!

My crockpot, however, cooked the 1.5 pound loaf in 4 hours on low.

I made no changes and I will definitely  make it again.  Just be sure to use a liner so you can lift it out to slice it.  Family loved it and we are a "meatloaf" loving group.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a wonderful meatloaf recipe.  I lined my crock pot with aluminum foil and after following the recipe, I removed it from he crock pot and put it in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes to brown the top.
I loved the ease, and the flavor!

Very good, moist and tasty.  I followed the recipe except I chopped up the mushrooms.  Only issue was the loaf was done in 3 hours not 5-6 as stated in the recipe.

The sage made this dish taste awesome. I would delete the mushrooms next and take 15 minutes off the ending time so there is slight burning on the sides of the crock pot 
(i did spray Pam beforehand)

My first time meatloaf and I enjoyed it. I baked it in the oven at  350 for 1.5 hours (Should of done 1.25). I didn't use mushrooms or sage. My son poured extra breadcrumbs. The sauce was delish!

This is a keeper.  I added 4 large cloves of garlic and I also made a mistake by including the sauce ingredients to the mix, wow outstanding.  I made a brown gravy as well.  Yummy!

I didn't have mushrooms on hand, but stayed with the recipe otherwise. I really liked how the meatloaf came out in the slow cooker! Tasted really good and was moist. Next time I will keep it on for a little less time though. Every slow cooker is different, seems like mine, one of the newest, cooks at a little hotter temperature, even though I used a Low setting. I am also looking forward to trying it with mushrooms .

I gave it four stars because I changed a few things  I used 2.5tsp of dried minced onion, two cloves of minced garlic,1/2 tbs. of thyme, don't like sage. Also left out mushrooms because we don't like them also used Chili sauce not ketchup and 1tbs of brown sugar. Baked at 350 for 1hr15minutes.

This recipe was delicious. My husband told me I must keep that recipe for future use. I made no changes to the recipe. Along with the meatloaf I had the easy recipe for asparagus baked in the oven at 425 degrees. Yummy! In fact I look to All Recipes all the time because I have had such success with the recipes

I didn't have time to make it in the crockpot, so I cooked it in the oven for one hour. Only thing I would do different next time is only cook it for 45 minutes and then take it out and add the sauce and put it back in for 5 to 10 minutes. It was definitely finished cooking after one hour. I let it rest under the foil for 10 minutes, and it cut beautifully and was delicious! It was by far my favorite meatloaf to date.

Excellent meatloaf.  Sliced well.  Reading the reviews, I added garlic, a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce. I also replaced 1/4 lb of ground beef with lean ground sausage.  The simple sauce was very, very good.  Just the right amount of mustard to keep it from being too sweet.  I cooked in slow cooker by temperature using an excellent meat thermometer.  It cooked much more quickly than indicated by the original recipe.

My son and I really enjoyed this meatloaf. Since I didn't have sage it was omitted and I did add 1 t garlic powder, and doubled the sauce recipe. I took another reviewer's advice and drained the grease when it was done. and put loaf back in the slow cooker to complete it. Easy and delicious!

I cooked in a glass meatloaf pan at 350 deg. for 1-1/2 hours instead of in a slow cooker.  Very moist.  Made a mushroom gravy to top it off.  I would cook again.

The sauce is too ketchupy 

 The meatloaf is very good. The sauce is the average ketchup & brown sugar sauce, which I tried to alter by adding tomato paste. It was STILL TOO KETCHUPY! I will make it again but eliminate ketchup and use only

This meat loaf is tasty, and moist without falling part. A keeper! We will make this again with the slight variations we made.
Mushrooms are not a favorite in our house so I omitted them without sacrificing texture. I actually added all the ingredients together, omitting the brown sugar, cooked it in a 375 oven for one hour in a 9x12 pan after shaping it. when done, I moved it from the pan and made gravy with the drippings.

I show my respect for the creator’s recipe by following the instructions (as written!) How else can one make fair evaluation statements if personal changes have been added to the test recipe? I will make this recipe again soon with only one slight change, I will double the Worcestershire sauce.

Thank you so much for this easy and wonderful recipe!

Great starting point for delicious meatloaf. I used one pound of ground turkey and a half pound of lean ground beef. I used half of a medium size onion, finely chopped, instead of dried minced onion. The breadcrumbs I used were Italian-style seasoned, so I chose not to add garlic. I baked at 350 for one hour, checked internal temp (was well over 165), added topping (which I doubled), and returned to oven for 15 minutes. It was juicy and satisfying! I will make it again!

I added my own spices because it sounded a little bland.  I was glad I did.  It was still a little bland, but it was very moist.  It was pretty easy to put together.  I would probably make it again.

So I saved this recipe and totally forgot it was a slow cooker recipe. I did everything exactly as is except I substituted fresh onion for the dried stuff. Then I had to cook it in the oven. So I cooked on 350 for about 50 minutes, and put the sauce over it at the 35 minute mark. It worked just as well! So if you're like me, you can bake it like a normal meat loaf and it still tastes great!

I made it but I baked it in the oven at 375' for 45 minutes.  It is very tasty.  I love the topping with the brown sugar added and the dry mustard gives it just the right amount of zip! This will be my standard from now on!

It was wonderful!  I followed exactly except left out mushrooms and sage cause my hubby doesn't like those things.  I would never have thought of cooking a meatloaf in the slow cooker but all the rave reviews convinced me to try.  I will always cook that way from now on.  Easy clean up.  It was not floating in grease anymore than in a pan in the oven.  It came right out with a large spatula for serving.  You can add whatever you like to this basic recipe.

Excellent!
My husband and I loved it. I made a little over double the sauce, and almost doubled the ingredients because I used more ground beef, but I made as per instructions. It was very different from my traditional meatloaf, but in a fantastic way. Thank you for sharing. This will def be getting made again.

very good meatloaf! I have my own meatloaf recipe but decided to try something new and was very pleased. the meat itself was very moist but lacked slightly in flavor so will add steak seasoning and garlic powder next time I make it,. overall,  moist and tender! the sauce topping is delicious!

I sure wish this site still gave you the option to make your own notes on recipes. If I add  or replace an ingredient or need to note how long I needed to baked it,  I forgot what it was by the time I make it again.
This was really good but I probably wont remember I had to bake in the over at 350 for 1 hr 15 min. 
I didnt have 5-6 hours to spare for cooking in a crockpot.

I turned the mix into meatballs as they are more convenient for me. They were ok and would ha e been much better without the sugar. Leave brown sugar out. Otherwise ok.

I made this 3 times now and the only thing I changed was to omit the mushrooms and cook in the oven @350 for about an hour. The second time I made it,  doubled the sauce. We like lots of sauce on the side.  I never was into meatloaf, but this one is delish.

The wife and I were too hungry to do the slow cooker route, so I baked it  at 375 for 45 minutes covered, then spooned on i the ketsup mixture and put the pan back into the oven for another ten minutes.  No sage; substituted thyme.  No powered mustard; substituted some Grey Poupon.
Never made such delicious meatloaf!

Made with with a mixture of Ground Beef and Venison, added fresh garlic and doubled the sauce. Baked in the oven at 350 for one hour.  I have also made this into hamburgers instead of meatloaf,  spooned the sauce on top.  Excellent!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was awesome! We have tried many meatloaf recipes over the years, and this one is our new go to.  My favorite thing is that it is flavorful without garlic. I am not a garlic lover and most meatloaf recipes have it. This one provides plenty of flavor without it - my husband didn't even notice. The mushrooms are an interesting feature I would never have tried on my own -we loved the flavor as a result. The topping, which we liked, was a little too sweet for us, but still very good and I think most people would love it. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this meatloaf to company - it was that good. Oh, and it held together in the crock pot perfectly.

Well, It's not my meatloaf which is loved and begged for. It is  a notch or two above good and i'm sure it will all be gone by tomorrow. Put it this way & no offense, my son said I made lazy meatloaf.

My family loves this! I have made it probably a dozen times but tonight I made it in the oven for the first time. Definitely a keeper. I also don't always have the mushrooms on hand and they love it either way!

Personally I did not care for the sweet ketchup sugar topping.  I suppose some may but the whole thing didn't work for me or my husband.  I love mushrooms in my meatloaf but this is not a keeper for me.  I will stick to my tried and true...

This is now my go to meat loaf! I have tried so many over the years but this one has definitely won the blue ribbon in our house. Sometimes I use the slow cooker but if I forget to put the ingredients together in time for that I'll just bake it at 350° for @ 1 hr. It turns out perfect every time. Be sure to add just the right amout of sage as too much can be overwhelming. I also add a small amount of minced garlic. I have a small rack to place in the bottom of my slow cooker so that's a big help in removing the meat loaf when it's done. I highly recommend trying this recipe!

As I do not have a slow cooker, I used  a 350-degreee oven, based on a review from another reviewer.  I was a bit disappointed in the flavor, as I had expected more of a Hungarian goulash effect b because of the combination of ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar, which are  the ingredients of the glaze.  (In fact, the amount of glaze could have been increased.)  Next time, I'll include these ingredients in the meatloaf itself.  However, it was moist and also easy to remove from the pan.

I dont even like meatloaf but this I love. I omit the mushrooms, use ritz crackers instead of bread, only top in equal parts of A1 and ketchup and use venison. I modify it a lot but the seasonings and flavor is great!!!!

I cooked this in the oven @ 375 for about an hour.  Then added the sauce for an additional 10 min.  I didn't realize it was a crockpot recipe.  It came out great.  My kids don't like onions so this gave the flavor of them without them knowing.

Did not make any changes.  Prepared the meat loaf the night before, set it on a small round rack covered with foil, In the morning  set the rack with the meatloaf in  crockpot . Approx  6 hours later, meat loaf was well done, fat dripped in bottom of pot.  Poured the sauce over the loaf and baked another 15 minutes to warm the sauce.  We all enjoyed it and the following day, it sliced so nicely.  Used 80 percent lean hamburg. My go to meat loaf.  So nice cooking it in the crockpot , the only way I will no cook my meat loaf.  Thanks for sharing.  Dorrie

This was delicious! I'm super iffy about meatloaf in general, and meatloaf in a slow cooker seemed really odd, but this was simple to make and absolutely delicious! Oddly, it wasn't heavy at all and the flavor was wonderful. I excluded the mushrooms because I am not a fan, and it was still really great.

My husband thought it was great, but he was really craving meatloaf. I don't think it was any better than any other types of meatloaf I've made. I'm pretty sure meatloaf is just meatloaf no matter how much you want to make it special.

It tasted very good. It was quite soft however-may be a lot of liquid in the mushrooms? Biggest problem was getting it out of the crockpot! Think I will just do it in the oven next time. Hubby approved of this one! For seasoned breadcrumbs, I used the Garlic and Herb variety. Smelled great too!

I have been making meat loaf for many, many years.  Unfortunately I don't like to follow a recipe, this often creates a problem. If the meatloaf is good I can't usually replicate it.  So, this time I decided to follow a recipe.  I chose this one after reading several reviews.  The result...outstanding. My teenage son who admitted to not liking meatloaf much LOVED it, as well as my husband who considers himself a meatloaf addict.  My husband said this is the best meatloaf he has ever eaten! A bold statement to say the least.  I will be putting this I my meal rotation.  The only change I made was to add fresh minced garlic and omit the mushrooms as my son is not a mushroom fan.  I do recommend making more sauce ( I made 1.5 the amount called for)  and also baked it in the oven (1 hour @ 350 & 10 min rest before serving).  A super easy recipe that is quick to pull together at the last minute. Try it, I don't think you will be disappointed!

I didn't have time to make before work so I cooked it in the oven at 425.    It was delicious and moist.  I forgot to take it out to put on the glaze. so it was a bit crispy (and delicious) on top.  I added the glaze after I removed from oven and let sit for 10 minutes it worked out well.  Will cook again!

This has become a part of my regular meal rotation.  My family really likes this recipe, even my picky 7 year old. I do omit the mushrooms but it's still great dish without them.  I recommend doubling the amount for the sauce, it's really delicious.

Except for adding garlic, I made the meatloaf according to the recipe. It was very moist and flavorful. (I used Angus ground chuck.) I will definitely make it again. While the prep time to make this meatloaf is not any less than the traditional baked version, this slow cooker version is a fantastic alternative on a weeknight when you don't have an extra hour plus to bake.

Amazing! I hate meatloaf and cringe when my family wants it so reading these reviews I thought I would give it a try. It was fantastic! I made it as it is written but left out the mushrooms due to allergies to them with some of my family.  It had great flavor and held together and was very filling. I will definitely make this again!

My family liked the taste.  I did chop the mushrooms up much finer.  I used 90/10, so there was some grease.  Next time I'll use 95/5.  It turned out much better than I thought, being as it was in a slow cooker.  We'll make this again.

I left out the mushrooms because 3 of my 6 children don't like mushrooms. When I make it next time I plan on putting half the mushrooms in after they are ground up and not say anything and see what happens! I've done that before and the kids never knew the difference! Shame on me...Right! Oh well.

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made. It came out delicious! I used 80/20 ground beef (I had to Google what kind of ground beef to use and got that it should be fairly high fat so it would stick together). I made up the meatloaf the night before, refrigerated overnight, then put it in the Crockpot around lunchtime so it would be ready for dinner. The only change I made to the recipe was failing to measure the mushrooms (I used probably a full cup instead of half).

Although I didn't use mushrooms I found this to be a very good recipe.  I would never have thought to use the slow cooker to make meat loaf but it turned out very well.  The only thing I did differently was change the setting for the last hour to high so it would be ready in time for dinner.  Both my husband and I agree we will make this again.

The meatloaf is extremely moist, holds it shape and is quite delicious. I did add a tsp of pepper, 2 cloves of and I used 2 pounds meat making it a combo of beef and ground pork for added flavor. I also used a full cup of mushrooms. I substituted Panko bread crumbs and seasoned them with a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. 

The next time I make it i would also double the sauce on top. The base recipe is great for starting out but it did need adjusting.

Made it according to recipe, except omitted mushrooms. Formed meat loaf cup cakes with it and put mashed potatoes icing on them with green pea " sprinkles".
Good reliable recipe for homestyle comfort food.

I made this recipe as listed, but left out sage as I don't care for it.  The meat loaf was fantastic, so easy, my husband & I ate more than half of it the day we made it.  Leftover cold sandwiches were great too.  Have told all my friends about it!

I was in a hurry and instead popped it in the oven for 40 minutes at  375 degrees using a meatloaf pan.  I also used jalapeño ketchup as my hubby and I like spicy foods, plus a whole cup of sliced mushrooms and next time will use even a bit more.  I served it with simple mashed potatoes and carmelized carrots.   It turned out moist and delicious with plenty for leftovers.  Will definitely make it again.

This tasted too salty to eat.  Had to toss it.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe called for was I used a combo of ground beef and ground pork which I often do with meat loaf.  Perhaps that's why it was too salty.

This turned out nice. I made a few changes. I used a pound and and half of meatloaf mix (beef, pork, and lamb) and a pound of 85/15 ground beef. I chopped the mushrooms up finely and added another tsp of dryed minced onion and some garlic powder.  I doubled the sauce. It was a little too sweet so next time I'm going to omit a tbsp.

This was pretty tasty, and my picky husband loved it. I read reviews before making it and took the advice to double the sauce and added some garlic salt to the meat. Many of the reviewers said that it held together better than they thought it would, but mine was pretty crumbly on the edges making it kind of hard to get out of the slow cooker. Taste-wise, though, I would definitely give it 4 stars. **I've made this 3 times now and have changed the rating to 5 stars.  Definitely double the sauce! Instead of 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, I used 1/4 cup of diced mushrooms.  For bread crumbs I used Vigo Italian.  So easy and soooo tasty!

I am going to try to make it in my slow cooker and reduce milk to 1/2 cup and add 1/4 cup of smoked BBQ sauce into the hamburger mix.  I also add 1/4 cup sweet relish & 1/4 cup BBQ sauce to glaze.  I do both of these things with my oven meatloaf and I get rave reviews.  I am hoping that cooking it in my slow cooker will allow me to make it in the morning for busy day dinners and that it will cook more evenly.

Made this for supper last night.  We loved it.  My husband said it was the best I ever made.  He loved the topping that you put on in the last 15 minutes.

Used turkey instead of beef, can't eat beef. Came out very good, moist, held it's shape. Served with some mashed potatoes and green beans. Good meal!  I added a little garlic too.

I have been making this recipe since 1974, just not in a slow cooker. My family has always enjoyed it, especially the topping . I am going to try this in the slow cooker next time.

Really enjoyed this meat loaf. Next time will add garlic and will also make double the quantity of sauce as it is so tasty.

Great recipe and all, but I don't get the phrase "not your regular old meatloaf".  It is exactly your regular old meatloaf.  If I were to make meatloaf without any instruction or recipe, this is essentially what I would make minus the mushrooms.  Still delicious though.

Followed the recipe except I added garlic. The meatloaf was fantastic!!! However the sauce was a BBQ style sauce and very sweet. I think next time I'll use more tomato & a lot less sugar.

I didn't have time to cook it in the crockpot so I baked it in the oven like several other reviewers. It was delicious! Had lots of flavor and very moist. My husband loved it! Will definitely try again.  Hopefully, next time in the crockpot.

I have eaten and tried a lot of different meat loafs and most of the time just throw them together. But thought I would try this one. It was by far the best meat loaf I have ever eaten and my husband real liked it too. I how ever did not cook in the crock I will try that next time I make it. I also did not have dried minced onions so just diced up about half of a yellow onion it turned out so good. I bet I never just throw one together ever again from now on I will use this recipe.

I have made this meatloaf several times and it is my favorite meatloaf recipe by far.  I added a crushed garlic clove and a half teaspoon of black ground pepper of a little more flavor.

My boyfriend went nuts for this recipe!  This was my first attempt at making a meatloaf and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out, so flavorful and moist!  I did double the sauce and poked several holes in the top of the loaf about halfway through cooking and applied half the sauce.  I then applied the rest of the sauce at the end. Delicious!!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I made it. It was great.  I used carrots, onions, and substituted stuffing for breadcrumbs. ( i didn't have any bread crumbs). It turned out great.  It didnt fall apart at all.  
 Tip: I  wouldnt use all the milk, I would see what you think would be enough .   Yummy.

This is honestly the best meatloaf I've ever made. Our oven is down so I made it in the crock pot using a liner and it came out great. I also added garlic,  and I doubled the topping amount.

All I can say is thank you. My husband is the most picky eater in the world and he loves this meatloaf. Only change I made was to add a bit more brown sugar. This so moist and hold together perfectly. Love it!!!

This is hands down finger licking good. I am not blessed in the world of cooking as a 27 year old woman. However, these simple crock pot recipes from this site has been helpful. I followed the instructions on this and made it the exact way. The only thing I did not have was the ground mustard and sage. In the place of sage I used Italian Seasoning. It worked fine. I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours instead of the recommended low. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef. It actually tastes a lot better. It melted in our mouths. My neighbors and boyfriend said it was the best meal I ever made. SO FREAKING GOOD AND MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH>>> FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND GIVE IT A TRY

very easy, mixed it all up formed it and then froze it to cook later this week. I'm sure the cooking time will not be the same but i have a meat thermometer to test it with. I made two loaves , one with spices out of the garden and one with onion soup mix. with the later I did not have bread crumbs so I used two  pieces of bread instead. My mother made hers that way all the time so I know it will be great. thank you for such an easy, quick and wonderful recipe. I can't wait to put it in the crock pot. I will try and update as to how it turned out .

I made it according to the recipe and it was okay but the mushrooms weren't something I've had in meatloaf before and they just didn't work for me. Also it fell apart really bad but the sauce is a keeper. I went back to my old reliable meatloaf recipe but I switched to this sauce and my kids even have me making extra to serve on the side.

I wanted a meat loaf but did not want to use the oven because the house is hard to cool down this time of year and the oven makes the A/C work harder. I found this crock pot recipe and tried it. I didn't use the sage (not for my taste) but instead used about half of a brand name spice packet for meat loaf which had some dried onion in it. Next time I'm using chopped 1/2 onion. Sauce was good but not really enough. I used 1 pound locally farm raised ground beef  and 1 pound good quality supermarket ground sausage. Drippings were minimal.  The flavor was very good and the loaf held together nicely. Adding minced garlic next time , 1 tsp of worcestershire and the fresh onion. I didn't have mushrooms but will also chop and add next time.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Very good! I did make a few changes, I used canned mushrooms in steak sauce for a little more flavor, and chopped a fresh onion, added granulated garlic and pepper. Like another reviewer I cooked it in the oven, used 2 lbs meat so cooked at 375 for 1 hour 15 min. The family loved it, but next time I will double the sauce.  I gave it 4 stars because it was very good, but I made the changes which for us made it a 5 star!

I loved this recipe, so did my husband who said I could not make meat loaf. This meat loaf is so good and moist. I did not change a thing. The only thing I wish I had made more of the sauce to go on top of the meat loaf. Thank you sooooooooooo 
much. This will be how I will make my meat loaf from here on in.

The only changes we made were to use fresh onion, add a clove of garlic, subbed 1T of honey for part of the brown sugar,  and cook the loaf in the oven on a slotted pan at 350 for one hour (adding topping for last 15 min).  Stellar!  Great moisture and texture. We did use the food processor to finely chop up the onion, mushroom, and garlic.

This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe by far.  I have made meatloaf cupcakes and traditional loaf also.    I did make a few changes; I omitted the mushrooms , used 2 lbs of ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork which I think makes the meatloaf more render and definitely more juicy and cooked in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes .  We use a meat thermometer and like the temp to get to 160.  

Make this recipe if you love a good sage meatloaf you won't regret it.

I can't give it 5 stars yet because I didn't have all the ingredients to make it the "right" way. I did not have mushrooms or ground mustard. I ended up using prepared mustard and I added a few strips of bacon to the top during cooking. I will definitely make this again (the right way). Couldn't believe this came out of my crockpot!!! YUM

This meatloaf is fantastic! It's the perfect texture and the glaze on top is great. The only changes I made were that I used a half of a yellow onion and I doubled the glaze. Besides that, this recipe was great as is!

I made this twice, the first time I just left out the mushrooms (not a mushroom fan) and it definitely needed more flavor. The second time I doubled the sauce and it more than made up for the lack of mushrooms.

This is our favorite meatloaf recipe.  I've made it many times, sometimes I use 2lbs of ground beef and leave out the mushrooms.  We like it with or without the mushrooms.  Also, I usually double to sauce for on top and put half on the meatloaf and use the other half in case anyone wants extra sauce.

Really good recipe.   Love how the loaf stays together - it slices beautifully!   It has a really nice texture and is very moist.  I also love that this cooks in the crock pot!  Very easy and quick to prepare.   I did have to substitute quick oats for about half of the bread crumbs because I forgot to buy more.  And I used 2 lbs of ground beef - 85/15.   The taste was good, just a little too mild for us.  I will definitely use this recipe again & add some additional spices next time to kick it up a notch.

This was my first time using a slow cooker and it worked out perfectly, actually cooking an hour quicker than the recipe stated.  I added a dollop of bbq sauce to the glaze, used parsley instead of sage, and used canned (well-drained and diced) mushrooms.  Using a plastic slow cooker liner made clean-up a breeze.  So tasty and easy.

Very delicious and super easy to make! My family loved the topping; it's different that just the boring old ketchup topper and was so tasty! I did make a few changes based on reviews. I didn't have time for slow cooker so I put it an meatloaf pan and baked for an hour at 400 degrees, then added topping and cooked for 15 more mins. I omitted the sage and added two tsp of minced garlic. Didn't add mushrooms, I don't like that in my meatloaf. It turned out very well and my family raved about it! We paired it with the easy red potato recipe on this site and steamed broccoli. 10/10 a must make!

We really liked it. I made a few insignificant changes. Used 2 pounds of  lean ground chuck, didn't have mushrooms, added a little fresh ground pepper, and didn't have ground mustard so substituted prepared. I really don't think any of that made much difference except for eliminating the mushrooms. Used two spatulas to remove it from the crock pot - successfully - and after allowing it to rest for about 5 minutes, it sliced beautifully. We will definitely make it again.

Like others, I added garlic powder. I discovered that I didn't have ketchup so I substituted with spaghetti sauce. My family inhaled it.

It was a delicious and very tender meatloaf recipe! I added golden potatoes and added my own brown gravy to cook in, then put the suggested sauce on top. Marvelous tasting! Thank you for the great new twist to meatloaf, as well as a time-saver..

I make this at least once a week. If I don't have time for the slow cooker I put  it in the oven in a 9x13 pan in a loaf shape and glaze it and then bake it for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Throwing in some garlic never hurts either.

I will definitely make this meatloaf again, adding a bit more spice (probably Italian herbs) next time. Due to dietary restrictions, I substituted almond milk for dairy, gluten-free bread crumbs, no onion & no sugar in the topping sauce, but it was a BIG hit with my daycare kiddos and I loved it, too!

My whole family, who's very picky about meatloaf, loved this recipe. It was moist and held together wonderfully. I was out of bread crumbs so I crushed Ritz crackers and used them. I added garlic.  It was absolutely delicious!!!!

This is my first crock pot meal ever made and it made a believer out of my husband for sure. Everyone loved it except my son who is picky any way.  Made it exactly as said only i took out the mushrooms because we hate them and no sage because our store didnt have any.  It came out perfect. The only thing i would change is the sauce i would double it as others sugested. We will be making this again.

I have searched for years for a great meatloaf. This is IT. Terrific taste, easy and simple ingredients and a dynamite texture. The only variation on my side was going 1/2 ground beef (85/15), 1/2 lean ground pork ---- and adding three cloves of chopped garlic and 1 stalk of diced celery.  I also agree with other reviews that suggest chopping the mushrooms and doubling the glaze. I actually added the glaze about one hour left to cook. Making it in the slow cooker is best. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/3c of gluten free crackers (I didn't have breadcrumbs).  Also, I sprinkled with garlic powder.  It was delicious!

This is yummy!  I have made this a couple of times now.  I did follow advice of others by chopping the mushrooms, adding real chopped onion and adding some garlic.  And, yes, I doubled the sauce!  Looking forward to leftovers for tomorrow nights dinner!

Veery good. Third recipe I've used and it was amazing. I made a few minor changes after reading the reviews though. 

Didn't have time to use slow cooker, so I used the oven at 375 for an hour. 
Added fresh vegetables,  onions, bell peppers,  mushrooms and garlic. 
I sautéed the veggies first.
Also, someone said it was a little bland, so I seasoned my meat with Uncle Chris' gourmet seasoning. 
It was so moist and beutiful. Best recipe thus far.

This supper was enjoyed by all. Like others, I added 2 cloves crushed garlic, and omitted the mushrooms. The meatloaf was very moist and the parts that were glazed were very flavorful. The rest of it was a bit bland. Next time I make it, I'm going to try to mix half the glaze into the meatloaf, and see if that gives it more punch. 
I shaped the loaf so it only covered half the crockpot. Halfway through the cooking time, I poured in a bag of frozen carrots and 1/4 cup water. The carrots soaked in the flavor of the meat and were excellent!

Chopped the mushrooms and half an onion, used 1/4 tsp ground sage (since I didn't have rubbed sage), mixed three quarters of the sauce into the mixture and poured the rest of the sauce on top of the meatloaf before baking in the oven at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes....absolutely the best meatloaf ever! Thanks reviewers for all the helpful comments!

I add garlic and the last time I put a maple bacon weave on top.   I thought it would be hard to top the original recipe,  but bacon makes everything better.   My son told me this is his favorite meal I make, so there's that.

Way better than your boring normal meatloaf! Great taste & form. The only thing I changed was added some granulated garlic. I didn't have time for the crock pot, so I cooked it in the oven on 350 for 45minutes then added the sauce on top. Cooked for about another 15-20mins. Let cool for 10 mins before slicing. Awesome taste! Thank you for the recipe, will make this again for sure.

I have to admit, crockpot meatloaf didn't sound all that great to me, but tried it anyway.  Without a doubt, this is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I followed the recipe precisely with the exception of a homemade substitute for Worcestershire, also glad I took an earlier suggestion to make a lift out of foil.  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Absolutely great meat loaf! I will make it again many times. It was wonderful cold in sandwiches, too. I did change things because of what ingredients I had and didn't have. I used 1 pound ground beef, and  1/2 pound ground pork, and I didn't use mushrooms. The flavor and texture was perfect.

Just took the meatloaf out of the crock pot. I added garlic powder, about 2 teaspoons, I would of used fresh minced garlic bite but I realized as I already mixed everything that there wasn't seasoning I would normally use. I also added dried basil, 2 teaspoons. A couple family members do not like mushrooms so I omitted them. I also at the beginning put the crock pot on high for one hour to help set it. I then put it on low for 5 hours. It's delicious.

Meatloaf was definitely tender, but I did not like the slight taste of sage.  Maybe it would be better with ground turkey.
I used a liner and cleanup was easy!

Both my husband and I thought this was great.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I substituted canned mushrooms but I think fresh mushrooms would be even better.  I also used Italian bread crumbs since that is what I had at home.

I measured all ingredients exactly (as I do the first time with all recipes) and had to add a little extra breadcrumbs to make the meatloaf hold together.  The only other variation was that I used 1/4 c. minced fresh onions instead of the dried onions.  Otherwise this recipe came out perfectly.  Nice and moist but not falling apart, very sliceable.  For a Mexican variation I plan to add 1 small can diced green chiles and a 1 t. chile powder to the loaf, and the topping would be salsa-based.

This is our favorite meatloaf, after trying a few others that you make in a crock pot.  The only thing I change is that I make it with some fresh chopped onion, instead of dried.  Comes out perfect every time!

I didn't add mushrooms, only had unseasoned bread crumbs,  and forgot the sage and milk.   Added some beef broth later to add moisture.  Only had an 8 quart slow cooker and had to cook longer.  Yet very picky husband loved it.  Told me to make it exactly the same next time, lol.

excellent, but don't forget to place a small glass or other cylinder in the center of  meatloaf as it is cooking.  (Makes it shaped like and angel food cake.)  That lets the center cook as well as the outside, and makes it even overall.

Deliciously tender, moist, and does not fall apart. 

Changes I made: used 2 lbs. Ground beef., 6 Tbsps. liquid egg whites (didn't have regular eggs in hand) 2 tsps. onion salt (did not have dried minced onions on hand), 2 C. Sliced button mushrooms (LOVE lots of these) , 3/4 C. unseasoned Japanese panko bread crumbs (had on hand) ground black pepper (to preference),  and minced very finely in a food processor: a handful of baby carrots, 3/4 of a large green bell pepper and 5 cloves of garlic (because I LOVE that much garlic!)

This smelled awesome cooking in the crock and tasted sooo delicious. Made for a mouth-watering leftover meal too:)

Didn't change a thing this time but will substitute a chopped onion and add a bit a garlic next time. Very good as is though, easy to make and very flavorful.

This meatloaf is excellent as written.  Made it exactly as printed the first time and the only thing I didn't like was the large pieces of mushroom.  The mushrooms made slicing a challenge.

The second time I made it I chopped the mushrooms and used fresh onion.  I sautéed the onion and mushroom together and cooled on paper towels. This is the way I will make it from now on.  Oh, and double the sauce, definitely double the sauce. It's delicious!

This was really very good, a nice change from the onion soup mix style. One kid who hates meatloaf actually ate this "Ground Beef Dinner" lol. I doubled the recipe which fit just fine in my 4 quart slow cooker. I found it a little salty but I'm sensitive to it so will skip it next time. I used 2 lbs ground beef/pork mixture & 1 lb ground beef. Definitely a keeper.

My sister recommended this recipe to me ages ago and I finally made it last night for the first time.  Perfect comfort food, moist, and delicious.  Wish there were more leftovers!  Doubling the recipe for the next big family gathering.

I made this meatloaf for my family and they were crazy about it. My 15 year old son could not stop eating. 
The only thing I changed was instead of using the entire amount of milk I used half the amount and I did not have worcestershire sauce so I substituted soy sauce. I also made an extra serving of the topping to make sure there was enough to glaze all the slices. I will definitely make this one again, I even forwarded to my daughter.

I buy my meat at costco and their ground beef is only 12% fat so it's very hard to get a moist meatloaf even when I add fat. So I followed this recipe exactly except I added a pound of italian sausage. This came out fabulous. It was so moist. I will never cook a meatloaf in the oven again.

This meatloaf is wonderful. My husband said it's a keeper. I did make some changes to suit our liking though. First of all, I left out the mushrooms. I added a half packet of dry onion soup mix, egg, milk, bread crumbs, pepper and parsley added hamburg meat, mixed well, and put in a loaf pan, baking  1 hour at 350. A half hour before the meat loaf was ready, I mixed the topping, poured over meatloaf, leaving the foil off, baked for 30 min.This meatloaf had such flavor, and didn't fall apart, a problem I've always had with meatloaf in the past.

It was very good, I used fresh onion and garlic and herbs - chopped the mushrooms as per other suggestion, don't feel you need to double the sauce. I loved the convenience of using the slow cooker in the summer rather than heating the oven. I also added about a half pound of Italian sausage only because I like the addition of flavours but you don't need to do that! Thank you for the recipe!

I am a terrible cook but, can follow directions well.  Made this and now my wife thinks I am a cook.  Don't tell her but, I always hated her meat loaf (35 years).  Being the sometime good husband I didn't complain because at least she was cooking and always grateful for someone cooking.  Just loved this receipt, thanks Nighthawk.

This recipe was great!  A huge success at the family dinner table.  Also very forgiving lol as I had to substitute a couple of things!  I couldn't find breadcrumbs at the grocery store (like I lapped it 20 times!  Apparently I don't know where they exist!  So I used crushed crackers and jerk seasoning and garlic red pepper seasoning - also subbed HP for Worcestershire sauce).  It was tasty and delicious and tender and juicy.  Instant favorite!  *maybe next time I will actually have breadcrumbs lol

This was wonderful!! I admit, I was skeptical using the slow cooker for a meatloaf, but at the same time it's the reason I tried it instead of my usual meatloaf. I am IN LOVE with my slow cooker. I work 10pm-7am and sleep during the day, while my fiance works from 9am-8pm, so we have little time to eat and I sleep during the day so something I can put on and it cooks while I sleep is a great thing. All that said, the only change I made was adding a green bell pepper and omitting the mushrooms, since I hate them. I started it at around 4pm and when my fiance walked in it was ready for eating. Wonderful taste! This will be my new go to for meatloaf. Thanks for submitting a wonderful recipe!

This is the first time that I have given a bad rating, and I really hate to do it, but my family and I couldn't even finish what we cut off and put on our plates. The meatloaf itself maybe 3 stars, but the topping was worse than a 1 star. Going back to my recipe as I wanted to see someone else's take on meatloaf, and it was a terrible detour.

I have made this several times.  The first time I followed the recipe except to add garlic.  We thought the 
meat was very bland, but the sauce was great.  So next time I made the sauce and mixed it in the meatloaf.
Then made sauce again and put on top per recipe.  Took care of the bland taste.  Even my husband who
thought meatloaf was some kind of torture loved it.  Use a liner in your crock pot and you will have no 
trouble removing the loaf.

I actually haven't tried this recipe - because I need to know this first:  Doesn't the bottom part of this meatloaf get awfully greasy?
If not, how do you prevent that from happening?

Turned out fantastic with a few changes. Per the magazine recommendations,I only cooked it for 3 hours before putting the sauce on. I didn't have dried minced onion, so I used fresh onion and some onion salt. I also added some minced garlic and oregano. Wonderful! My husband said it was the best meatloaf I've ever made.

I really wish we could rate the sauce and the meatloaf separately. The meatloaf is EXCELLENT.  My extremely picky 5 year old and my meatloaf-hating husband both loved it, which was a miracle.  Due to food preferences in our house, I made this with ground turkey instead of beef, added garlic powder, and omitted the mushrooms.  I did end up having to add more bread crumbs because my mixture was too liquidy before it went into the pot.  I made the glaze exactly as written, but doubled it according to other reviewer's suggestions.  As I said, my whole family adored the meatloaf.  I thought that the glaze was edible, but nothing special, and had a little too much of the mustard in it for my taste.  Overall definitely something I would make again, this time without the glaze.

I give it 5 stars. It was delicious, cut the recipe down  for 3 people, big mistake should have used the original one :-)
I used Panko bread crumbs, only ones I had.

Wasn't a fan of this recipe. Why wait five hours to cook it in the crockpot when you can bake it in the oven in one? 
The ketchup topping was way too sweet and the meat was still pink in spots

My family absolutely loved this meatloaf.  We had one little slice left after multiple helpings to all.  The only change I made was fresh chopped onion instead of the dried. I made a double batch of the sauce for dipping.

Great dish! Very simple to make. I used 1lb of ground turkey with less of everything else. Next time I will add more seasonings just to make it more flavorful. I got a little nervous when the meat became diluted from all the liquids. Never made meat loaf so I didn't know this was common until I called mom. Overall, not bad. Family loved it! That's all that matters to me.

A really nice meatloaf recipe! I did bake it in the crock pot, as instructed. It only took about 3 hours in my crock pot, so I just shut it off and then turned it back on about 1/2 hour before dinner to warm it through. The sauce was a tad bit too sweet, so I'd cut the brown sugar back to maybe 1 Tbls. next time. It really does melt in your mouth! Thanks NightHawk!

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  My husband and I had seconds because it was that tasty.  I added a jalapeño and silk milk (vanilla)  and would definitely make it again ??

This meatloaf is so yummy and has become a staple in my house! I follow the recipe exactly, and it's the only meatloaf that my picky husband will eat over and over again! I make a triple batch whenever I make it so I can freeze two and make one for that day; freezing  and then slow cooking it always turns out wonderful! The only thing I can really say is that really crisp mushrooms never seem to make the meatloaf "stick together" very well, so this recipe is great for using leftover mushrooms!!!

Delicious and easy! I did make some minor changes after reading other reviews, such as chopping the mushrooms instead of slicing; and added chopped onions and a bit of garlic. Family loved it. Sauce was delicious so made more of that as well!

It was good. I found it kind of dry and not that much flavor to it. Next time I think I will add some more spices.

I've finally found the perfect family meatloaf. I adjust my serving size to 8 ppl and we eat leftovers the next day. This is a meal my kids are guaranteed to ask for seconds with. The only thing I drastically adjust is the sage. I use 1 tablespoon.

I've never posted a review, but this was so good I couldn't resist.  I love meat loaf and was hesitant to even try this thinking a meat loaf in a slow cooker would make the texture, for the lack of a better word, mushy. I followed the recipe as written except for, as others recommended, I went the Lipton Onion Soup route and doubled the glaze ingredients.  This meat loaf, honestly, was the best I've ever had.  The texture, which is very important to me, was perfect!  The overall taste supreme.  I will absolutely make this again (and again)!  The only change will be cutting back on the sugar as it was a bit too sweet for me.  Add mashed potatoes and a green veggie and it's the perfect meal.  My husband gave it two thumbs up and we made meat loaf sandwiches with the leftovers.  Delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've made this twice now, and it's an indisputable hit. Only deviation I made was where the sauce is concerned, I doubled the recipe because it was just so good. This recipe also works perfectly in the oven: 1 hour at 350F.

We loved this! The texture was fantastic I did leave out the mushrooms and I added about 1/4 cup of chili sauce to the meat instead just because I knew the kids wouldn't eat it with mushrooms. I will be making this one again. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

First of all, I HATE to cook. Hate it. However this recipe is easy and delicious. It's a no fuss recipe and what's nice is that most of the ingredients, except for the meat and mushrooms, once you have them, they last a long while so you are not constantly have to get them at the store. I highly recommend this for non-cookers!

Delicious! This has got to be one of the best meatloaf recipes I've very had.  I followed the recipe exactly, although next time I think I'll double the sauce. It was very tasty and I found myself scraping the side of the slow cooker to see if I could salvage a bit more sauce.

I tried this for the first time today and my entire family LOVED it!   I did change a few things.   I omitted the mushrooms, used oats instead of breadcrumbs and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 1.5 hours.   My family of 5 is extremely picky, but there wasn't anything left except one slice when we were all finished.

My husband used to make meatloaf, he and the kids thought it was better than mine. That was until I made this recipe. I substitute panko for regular bread crumbs and baked it because my crockpot won't work. It turn out fabulous! ! We thought the sauce was a little sweet so I cut back on the brown sugar.

Absolutely delicious!!! The only change I made was adding some minced garlic (and I used ground turkey). Will definitely be making again! Yum!

This wasn't too bad.  I think I prefer using the vanilla wafers instead and will omit the mushrooms next time.

We've always loved meatloaf in my house, but this is now my go-to recipe! It's super easy, and absolutely delicious! I always double it to make enough for us, and have a little leftover. The only change I make is that I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. The glaze on top is my favorite part. It's the perfect sweetness to go with the hearty meatloaf. The last two times I've made it I didn't have Italian Style breadcrumbs, so I used crushed up crackers that we had. Works just as well!

This was fantastic!  It even received rave reviews from my picky teenager.  I doubled the recipe for two meatloaves.  I used two 20 ounce packages of Jennie-O ground turkey.  I omitted the mushrooms.  I added one apple, skin on, chopped in the food processor.  The extra liquid from the apple required more bread crumbs.  I used about 2/3 of a can of bread crumbs - the garlic and herb flavor.  I used half the amount of brown sugar in the topping.  It still was a bit sweet for me, so next time I will use 1 Tbsp. brown sugar for two meatloaves.  I added the sauce on top before placing in the oven.  I baked them in two glass loaf pans in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes, when reaching an internal temperature of 165.  I let the pans rest about 5 minutes before slicing.  The meatloaf was firm and held together.  Sliced well.  I served with a green salad, carrot sticks and mashed potatoes and turkey gravy.  Delicious!

I cooked in crockpot for about 3 hours and then transferred to a baking dish to cook at 400 for 15 minutes with a double batch of the sauce.  I put cut-up garlic cloves from the Mediterrenan bar from Wegmann's (so they are soft and sweeter).  Next time I could transfer about 1/2 the juice from the crockpot to the baking dish.  I think it would be fine to cook the whole time in the crockpot too.  Sauce is delicious.

I really loved this recipe! I did make it with real minced onion though and I also added 2 cloves minced garlic (because garlic makes everything with a tomato base better!) :-) I also left out the salt (both the ketchup and the worcestershire sauce have a fair amount of sodium in them, so no need to add more) and used ground turkey instead of beef. Super, super yummy!!!

It was very good. My family enjoyed it and has requested it again. When the meat was done after 5 hours I took it out of the crock pot and put in a Pyrex pan. I put it the topping on and put it under the broiler. I was so good!!

this recipe was delicious!  i did as suggested and added worcestershire, real onions, two cloves of garlic, and salt and pepper to the meat mixture.  as suggested, i doubled the sauce.  i baked the loaf in the oven for an hour, and poured the sauce over to cook for another fifteen.  i'm sure the leftovers will be even better.  i'd like to try it again in the crockpot. definitely a keeper!!

I just made this recipe for the first time. It was definitely moist! I loved the flavor and the sauce! The only thing I did differently was brown the meatloaf in the oven at the end and add the sauce. I like a rich brown color that just didn't happen in the crockpot.

My young kiddos loved this ! I didn't have minced onions so threw in some onion soup mix. So don't add salt, the soup  adds its own salt.     This will be made again :)

Great meatloaf!! My 4 yr old and 2 yr old devoured it! I would add some garlic and chopped onion next time.  And double the sauce! Yum! The only thing I wish for is less grease. So if anyone has any tricks on how to lessen the grease, especially in a slow-cooker, please let me know!! I used 93/7 ground beef and even tried to pour out some grease before serving.

This is the recipe I have used for years.  Definitely don't leave out the sage and make double the sauce as everyone wants more on their individual plates. My family will not eat meatloaf any other way.

This was great! I've always had a hard time getting my meatloaf to hold together but this was nice and firm. My grocery store was out of hamburger so I combined a meatloaf mix of veal, pork and beef with ground chicken.  Normally I'd never consider chicken for meatloaf but it was so good I think I'll pass on 100% beef in the future. I also used fresh sage since its taking over my little herb patch. There was a lot of liquid in the bottom so I just poured it out before adding the sauce. I'll be using the crock pot for meatloaf from here on out.

Best meatloaf I have ever made! This recipe has made me a fan of meatloaf again.
The only changes I made were very minor- I left off the mushrooms, and I used real onions instead of dried minced onions.
I also love the fact I can cook it in my crockpot.
This recipe is going into my personal "cookbook"

I used everything for the sauce, but for the meatloaf mixture itself, I substituted sage and salt for a McCormick's meatloaf seasoning packet and I used the dried minced onions.  My husband loves when I used mushrooms in anything I make so I knew he'd like this but I've never make it in a crock pot before.  I think this meatloaf and sauce would come great in an oven as well.  So if I ever forget to put everything together in the crock before I leave for work I'll try it in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.

The meatloaf was very good! I was surprised. Very moist and the sauce is tasty too. I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand. When it's about 90% done and before I put on the sauce, I suctioned the grease out of the cooker. Everyone loved it!

I've tried this recipe a few times. I doubled the amount for the sauce, cause my dh loves extra. Recipe is awesome.
