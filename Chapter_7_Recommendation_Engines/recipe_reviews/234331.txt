We thought these were fairly yummy. I did not add any sweetener, only added coconut, raisins and walnuts. Be sure to add extra spices.

My grandsons love them! I switched out the walnuts for dairy free mini chocolate chips, and baked them in mini muffin tins. I also cut the cinnamon and nutmeg in half for the kids. I might like them better with full spice, and I think I will add coconut next time.

It was awful, what a waste of eggs and pumpkin. I followed the recipe as written, we are a family of 8 NO ONE could eat it. Don't waste your time :(

These are pretty good. They were a bit burned on the bottom (used muffin cups). I baked them a bit after 15 minutes at 4,000 feet.

These were just okay. My four year old loved them so that made me happy lol. But they were WAY too “eggy” for my liking.  6 eggs is a lot for one muffin recipe... ?? I used all the other ingredients except I switched out raw honey instead of agave. 

Honestly, they just didn’t have enough flavor for me. The 6 eggs dumbed down the pumpkin flavor. 

I didn’t add the nuts since my son doesn’t like them. But I added some unsweetened shredded coconut to the top of some. That added some texture. But the ones without coconut on top went pretty flat when I took them out of the oven... strange.

 Anywhooooo, won’t be making these again unless my son asks for them.

I am used to grain free baking so made a few tweaks using my usual ingredients..they turned out fine.  I changed agave to honey, used nonhydrogenated shortening instead of the coconut oil and cut the eggs back to 5 and added pecans instead.    They could have been a bit sweeter!

This is a good start, but I found these a little bit too dry
