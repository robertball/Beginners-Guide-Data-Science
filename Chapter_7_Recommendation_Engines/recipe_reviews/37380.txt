This is a terrific recipe and a nice alternative to meat-filled casserole dishes.  Try this one for sure!

This was easy to make and a treat to eat.  I can't say enough about it, and neither can my boyfriend!

To make it truly low-fat (I have a pacemaker), I used 1% cottage cheese instead of ricota, and part skim mozzarella instead of romano.

Thank-you all recipes!  Another hit.

This recipe was alright, but definitely nothing phenomenal.  I probably will not make this again.  I thought it was kind of dry and bland.

Very good and flavorful.  It had great color and my two year old son loved it, however, I think it should be called veggie macaroni bake, or something because it is not that cheesy.  All in all, we really enjoyed it and will make again.  (Great for potlucks or vegetarians)

I agree with another writer who said that it wasn't very cheesy. Still a great recipe though. I think addiing sausage or chicken would make this an instant side dish. Lots of possibilities for this recipe.
