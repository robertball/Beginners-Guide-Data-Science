Oh my goodness - these tender, delightful bites of goodness are amazingly flavorful, did I say tender?   
Call them a biscuit, call them a scone just call them to your kitchen, real soon.  
I made as directed but froze the butter and grated into the flour. The dough is very sticky, even after chilling, so I decided to just pat it into a round, score into eight pieces with a bench knife and bake on a silpat lined baking sheet. 
Note to self - try using 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of water - I bet that would be amazing.  If serving as a sweet, sprinkle with course grained sugar.  The addition of some cinnamon and or nutmeg would be great.
