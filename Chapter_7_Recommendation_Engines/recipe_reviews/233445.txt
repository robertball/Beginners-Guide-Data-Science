I can't believe this recipe has not been reviewed yet.   It is not your traditional stuffed pepper recipe, but this was just what I was looking for.  I used smoked parmesan cheese and roasted tomatoes in this,  otherwise I followed the recipe.  I like the idea of parboiling the halved red peppers.  This recipe got rave reviews at my house and I will be certainly making it again!   Thanks for sharing!

I liked this healthy alternative to hamburger.  I had a lot left over, you could have used three peppers instead of two.  I used the leftovers the next night and put it over spaghetti and it was delicious!  I saved it and will cook it again but as a nice alternative for spaghetti sauce as wekk

Made this as written and was a little "soupy". Next time I may add a little cooked brown rice, but was delicious!

I somewhat omitted step 4/ I didn't use the cream or milk our alot of other cheese in the mix. Just a few bunches/ pinches of cheddar cheese. They were delicious!

Nice recipe, enjoyed the mushrooms and ground turkey.  I like rice in my stuffed peppers so added whole grain Spanish Rice (already cooked) that added flavor as well.  Substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the chopped tomatoes and skipped the panko crumbs since using the rice.  Had more filling than the 2 peppers, could have filled 3-4 peppers

I made almost exact and it was delicious. The changes I made were based on what I had on hand (and didn't).  I used 1 lb Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey and canned chopped tomatoes. I also substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the Panko. I added some of the canned tomatoes to the turkey mixture as well as the Roux before blending.  I had 4 bells and was able to stuff all with the turkey. This dish was very delicious. Hubby said liked it better than ground beef/sausage stuffed bells.

I prepared as directed.  I love how a simple roux jazzes up a dish like this.  One thinks it we be the simple thing you grew up with ...  come to discover, it has fewer fat calories and better flavors.  Wow.  Thanks for another good one, Chef John.

I followed the basic recipe, though omitted the half and half, used half a can of condensed tomato bisque soup (only because I didn't have tomatoes on hand, will use tomatoes next time), added a pinch of red pepper flakes as suggested, then added spinach I needed to use and it was a hit! I also made more filling than peppers to fill, so I had a separate dish where I mixed the filling with some Italian seasoned bread crumbs. that was my husband's fave, I will make this again. thanks!
