If you add one more cup of sugar, plus more cinnamin it will taste great.  The first batch I made was not sweet enough for my family or friends, but when I added the extra sugar and cinnamin it was WONDERFUL!!!!

Fabulous!!!  I also added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used 2 large eggs instead of the egg substitute. I baked in a 9x13 pan - so I could cut into bars and freeze for lunchbox goodies!!....but would have been fab as a sort of sheet cake with a cream cheese icing - will try that next time!!

I substituted the applesauce for the oil and used dried cranberries instead of canned cranberry sauce because I had them.  I wouldn't suggest doing the latter.  I think it cut a little down on the sweetness.  Overall it's a tasty bread; I think it'd be even better if I'd used the sauce.  Also, the walnuts don't stay on the top very well when you try and cut the bread, so I'd suggest either punshing them down before baking or simply mixing them in the batter.

I made this incredibly aromatic and delicious bread with the few changes noted in other reviews: applesauce instead of oil, 1/2c more brown sugar, and 1tsp of each cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg.  This is going to become a family favorite and fall tradition in my home.

I made this bread for my Mother over the holidays, and she LOVED it! The cranberry and pumpkin really go well together. Plus, it was very moist. I will definitely make this recipe again - thanks!  :)

This tasted great, and was the perfect festive touch for the holidays. I made the following changes: added another 1/2 cup brown sugar; doubled the cinnaomn; added 1/2 tsp nutmeg; used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute; and mixed in chopped pecans instead of topping with walnuts.

Huge hit with my kids!  They cut into one I had made for a neighbor when they finished their own!  Substituted apple sauce for all the oil, added craisins to the batter and top (along with the walnuts).  Added more cinnamon in my second batch.  Modified slightly for elevation - less sugar and baking soda/power, a little more flour and apple sauce - very impressed with the rise and moistness.  Next time I'm going to add chocolate chips.

This is a fantastic bread!  Made this last year for Christmas gifts in small ceramic loaf pans.  This year, I already have people ordering it from me for the Holidays.   The only thing I changed was that I used 4 eggs instead of the egg substitute & added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Yummy!

I used Nutriblend Pastry flour instead of white -1/2 c. Br Sugar Splenda (in place of reg sugar) -more Cinnamon (1 1/2 Tsp) -1/3 c unsweetened applesauce (in place of oil) -zest of 1 whole orange -2 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. The rest I kept the same. This recipe freezes REALLY well & my husband has told me it's a KEEPER - I think so too... You certainly don't have to add more nuts like I did, but it works for us.  I've seen the applesauce sub for oil on this site and am grateful to eveyone who has made comments regarding it - it works fabulous.

Fabulous! I was worried about the egg substitute, not sure if a prepared powdered replacement would be good, but went with a few people that gave advice and used Egg Beaters. My bread came out wonderful. I did make one small loaf out of the batch minus the zest and walnuts because of one kid in the house. But added the complete amount of zest and walnuts to the rest of the batch...well I added more walnuts then stated for the top of the bread to make a great presentation and hmmmmm the bread was wonderful. It's a total keeper. Being able to use up lingering cans of things bought for Thanksgiving and Christmas on a rainy day...was perfect! I think I prefer this bread well over a plain pumpkin....don't get me wrong, that's good too, but this was great. It was moist, flavorful and gave that nice bite of citrus right at the end. And the aromatic of it baking in the kitchen made the whole house smell nice too. Thumbs up!

This bread turned out amazing! It's the first time I had attempted baking a treat-like bread, but I was so happy with the results! I also added a dash of apricot brandy to it for an extra moist texture - I love this bread more than at a cafe! Even after a few days, it kept it's moisture and seems to taste better after each day.  Thank you for sharing!!

I used 4 (organiic certified humane) eggs rather than substitute, and more nuts tho' I couldn't exactly say how much more.   Also, rather than 8x4 pans, I used 4 mini loaves.  Baking time was reduced minimally; perhaps 4-5 minutes.  Since it's mostly just the two of us at home, this worked perfectly.   We loved this bread, and it will become a staple.

I really liked the combination of tart cranberry with the pumpkin.  I did change 2 ingredients-used fresh chopped cranberries sweetened with a little sugar or splenda and 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.  Very moist and stays fresh for days.

It was very tasty. I followed the suggestions of using an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 eggs instead of the substitute. I also added a little ground ginger and nutmeg. I didn't have the walnuts so last min I threw some dried cranberries and white chocolate chips into the batter(happened to have them on hand) and it was very pretty and delicious.

After reading all of the other reviews, I added 1/2 cup additional brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, used nutmeg instead of cloves, used 2 large eggs instead of egg substitute and added about 1/4 cup chopped walnuts into the mixture.  Yummy!

I halved the recipe, then doubled the cinnamon, cloves, and sugar.  In place of egg substitute, I used 2 xlarge eggs.  Turned out great!  A moist, subtly pumpkin-flavored spice bread/cake.  Good with freshly whipped cream.

Delicious bread! Used orange juice because we did not have any oranges to zest. Would recommend using nuts or other topper in the future, the bread is a a bit dry/uniform otherwise. I would definitely make it again, though.

I made this into two coffeecakes. Take one to the office and the other for your family! I used jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole because that's what I had on hand. I also ground a WHOLE orange in my food processor and put half of it in the batter/saved half for the struesel. Added 1 c white sugar and 1 more tsp cinnamon to batter. Streusel: 1c trail mix(mine had almonds, raisins, dates, oatmeal), 1/2 c oatmeal, 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c white sugar, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 ground orange, and a little over 1/3 c butter-spin it all in the food processor and then divide evenly between the two cakes. Baked in a 9x9 AND a 7x10 pan. You'l LOVE the addition of the orange! Someone gave me several cans of the jellied sauce and our family really doesn't care for it but this was AWESOME!

Yummy, spicy bread. In hindsight, I think it would have benefited from dried cranberries in the mix too.

I thought this was great. My husband accidentally bought whole cranberry sauce and so I looked for a recipe for it. This is fabulous. Everyone that has tried it loves it. Now it has become a tradition the past two years and I'm sure will continue.

A delightfully dense and moist product!  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of vegetable oil and it came out beautifully.

I didn't like the flavor too much as it was too much like a pumpkin pie (I love pumpkin pie, but this is the wrong texture) Anyway, it's probably just personal.

This was really easy and delicious.  I don't like nuts and didn't have an orange on hand so omitted both and it still tasted great.  I'd definitely make this again and probably keep it in the oven for about 5 minutes shorter next time.

Really liked this recipe. Easy ingredients, easy prep and tasted delicious. I liked the fact it wasn't overly sweet and stayed moist and delicious for days! Only thing I did differently was to omit the nuts. Definitely worth keeping!!

Really delicious recipe!! I used fresh pumpkin & fresh cranberry sauce instead of canned. I added walnuts to the batter as well as put them on top.

Great recipe! The only changes I made were to use 2 eggs instead of egg substitute, and sprinkle a little more walnuts on top.

I made this as muffins with a few small changes and they're great!  I used 2 cups of flour and 1.5 cups rolled oats.  I skipped the cloves and I used a splash of orange juice instead of orange zest.  I also used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.  We'll definitely be making these again.

Amazing bread!  I used leftover homemade cranberry sauce for this and I didn't find the color to be strange at all (like some reviewers stated).  Moist and perfect and incredibly healthy!!!  No changes necessary!

I thought the recipe was great..I used two real eggs( from our chickens) and my own, homemade cranberry sauce from Christmas dinner so, that made it even better. Kids are allergic to nuts so I topped with brown sugar, oats, and coconut! I made mini loaves so that I could give them out at work! Everyone loved them..moist, delicious, and a great way to use leftover sauce from Christmas! Will make again!

1 cup of egg substitute equals 4 eggs. I made this using 4 eggs & a total of 3 cups of sugar, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white. I found that sugar amount to be just right. I put the nuts into the batter instead of on top of unbaked loaf. The cranberry taste was very mild. I had enough batter to make a 8X4 and a 9X5 loaf. I will definitely make this again. It was delicious.

I doubled the brown sugar. I even added half a cup of dark brown sugar, quadrupled the spices. I omitted the orange zest (I thought it would be great with out it and it was!) I made my own cranberry sauce with a package of fresh cranberries, 3/4 cup of water, Tablespoon of maple syrup, and some sugar on the stove. The bread was amazing!

We don't like too sweet cake, so I added only 2/3 cup of sugar.  I used 5 eggs instead of egg substitute).  I melted butter and let it cool down instead of using vegetable oil!!  They came out delicious (don't know how ..unhealthy it is!!  :)

I just couldn't taste the cranberries enough, and the over-all flavor was a bit blan for me. So, in my second batch I boiled 2cups of cranberries in 1 cup of sugar and 1tsp of cinnamon for 5 mins. then added it to the mixture

Much better!

I used the recipe with this changes:I used 2cups of whole wheat flour a 11/2 cups of white flour to increase the nutritional value, and made as muffins  for about 22mins. It was moist and delicious, I took some to work and it disappeared, my daughters loved it as well. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Love this recipe.  Easy to make too!  I did not use nuts as some friends are allergic.  I used a little more cinnamon, cloves and orange zest.  The zest of a medium orange work great.  The flavors are great together!  I've made this for 2 years and make loaves for gifts.

Thanks alot. Lovely combination of flavours. Really do appreciate the rich colour & texture, (in my culture, light coloured = undercooked). Also recipe easily lends itself to personal variations, although original is quite good.

I've used this recipe at least 3 times now.  Pretty tasty, not perfect, but tasty.

1 cup of egg substitute is about 4 large actual eggs.

This last time I used lemon zest rather than orange zest, which smelled pretty good prior to baking, but I couldn't taste it afterwards (neither can I of the orange zest).  Once I had put actual orange bits in the bread but I didn't like the texture.  I think I'll put 4x the called for orange zest next time, just to try.

I like mine to be rather cinnamonny, but even after I dump probably 4x the called for, I still can't taste as much cinnamon as I'd like.  :/    The pumpkin and cranberry flavor is good though, so I'm happy.

Nice moist texture.  I thought it could have a little more flavor maybe by increasing the amount of spices.  I did double the cinnamon and added ginger but it wasn't enough.  I also used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and added 2 tsp. of vanilla - may try orange extract next time.  My husband thought I should put the walnuts in the batter.   Will definitely make it again.

I did the suggestions of adding more sugar and cinnamon. I made my own pumpkin puree and cranberry sauce. I also used apple sauce instead of oil. Will play with recipe in making it even more healthier but will do again as is; it's a treat!

I used most of the ingredients, but substituted 2 eggs for egg substitute; applesauce for oil; and orange extract for orange zest.  This is the MOISTEST bread that I have ever eaten.  Even my picky eater loves it!

It was OK, but I was really looking for more of a cranberry impact than what I got with this.  Ended up making up my own recipe... If you're looking for a strong cranberry and pumpkin taste, this isn't the recipe for you.

The flavors were very good and intriguing. I definately thought it needed more pumpkin spices though. Also, I thought the texture was much too mushy, sort of like baked baby food puree. Next time I will use cranberrys instead of sauce and mix the nuts into the batter as well.

Moist and good, but I needed something more.  Next time I make it, I'm going to use more cranberries (dried) for some extra kick.

I was intrigued by the whole cranberry sauce, but not the best pumpkin bread we've had. I added two tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon and cloves. Still a bit bland. Good pumpkin/fruit balance with the cranberries and applesauce (instead of 1/3 oil). Good for a low-fat bread, but wouldn't make it again.

I added a bit of fresh nutmeg and used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute. It was moist, wonderful, flavorful and not as heavy and oily as most pumpkin bread.

I just made this, and it is fantastic! I used whole wheat flour, added some nutmeg, didn't have oranges so used lemon zest instead, and threw in a handful of dried cranberries since I had some in the pantry. I didn't have any nuts, so I omitted those, but I think this would also be great with the nuts mixed in. I'll defitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the easiest and tastiest quickbread I've encountered, and it's a great way to use up canned pumpkin and cranberry sauce! I'm not very religious about the spice ratio, and I usually use more than the recipe calls for, but the flexibility of this recipe is part of its charm. I also found that replacing the oil with applesauce tastes great and reduced the fat, though it shortens the shelf-life. This isn't a great concern, since it disappears so quickly!

I have gotten many requests to make this; it's becoming my signature at get-togethers! Also, my family reaps the benefit of the double-loaf production. (^_~) Thank you so much for sharing!

This was very good bread, especially after sitting overnight.  I may increase the spices and add nutmeg, just as an experiment.  Also, next time I make it I will put the nuts in the batter because the ones on top were great but there were not enough of them.

Used half whole wheat flour and half  all purpose.  Very moist.  Good warm or cold.  Just found there was too much ground cloves which overtook flavor.

The only changes I made were adding another 1/2 cup brown sugar, as suggested, and added about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter.  Oh, and 4 eggs, the equivalent to the cup of egg substitute.   I used the leftover cranberry sauce I had made for Thanksgiving.  Not sure what all the fuss was about the color of the bread?  As long as it tastes good, is all that matters.  And it is delicious!

I have made the bread using  the applesauce substitution, and found It to be a hearty flavorful loaf.  I agree with other reviewers on pressing the walnuts into the loaf or mixing it into the bread.  I'm going to try the muffins so I can have better control of the portions, and increase the spices.  Stay tuned for updates.

Well I had no idea what was meant by egg replacer... The egg replacer I have is a powder which would make the batter far too dry. Any idea what the author meant? I used 2 large eggs, as indicated by another user. I also forgot the nuts, I always forget them. I added a half teaspoon each of ground ginger, allspice and red mace. I rather liked that it wasn't overly sweet, just enough for me with 1 cup brown sugar. I would make this again, perhaps remembering the nuts.

Great way to use Thanksgiving pumpkin and cranberry sauce leftovers! Baked this for a holiday party, and everyone raved. I reduced all of the ingredients by 1/3 to make a single (large) loaf, EXCEPT (a) kept the quantities of the spices the same, plus added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg; (b) used the full amount of cranberry sauce (homemade); and (c) used 1.5 TBSP orange zest. Used two eggs instead of the egg substitute. The flavors were awesome and it was so moist! As I made an oversized loaf, I kept it in the oven for 65 minutes.

This was fun to make, and it was nice to use up the whole cranberry sauce can!  I brought them into work in as a cake (a very full 10x15 - 30 min) with a bit of cream cheese frosting.  In all honesty, the greenish-red color put people off.  If I make it again, I'd use red food coloring.  The people that tried it liked how moist it was and the flavor combo.  Thanks for the recipe JJohn32!

Bread came out moist and with a nice texture, but the flavors are way too overpowering, esp. the orange zest; I would omit that completely. It doesn't need it. This recipe isn't for me. Sorry.

I used part white/WW flour, added a 1/2 cup of white sugar, and used 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3 cup, then used Juliana's suggestion of 2 eggs. I had some leftover Pear Honey Cranberry Sauce from this site, so I used that instead of the canned variety. It may not have ended up as low fat as intended, but it was delicious. Nice texture, moist, and not too sweet, even with my addition of sugar.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it wasn't as great as I hoped.  It was good, though.  I used applesauce for the oil and 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and didn't have the orange zest.  I think I would rather make a regular pumpkin bread with dried or frozen cranberries in it instead of the canned stuff.  This smelled wonderful and was great while still warm, but the next day it just wasn't as good.

this recipe turned out very moist with the apple sauce substitued for the oil.  it could have used more spice to kick it up as it tasted good, sweet enough, but lacked something to make me say it was great rather than good.

I thought this bread was great!  Very moist, and lots of flavor.  I added nuts throughout the bread.  It made two big loaves, but they disapeared quickly.  This was the best recipe for Pumpkin bread ever.

Yum!
My kids are allergic to egg in any form...
So I used 1 cup apple sauce in place of the egg substitute.
Turned out fine with substitution.
Made two and froze one to have on hand for company!
Thanks for submitting this recipe Eleanor :0)

This is an excellent bread--my new favorite. Put 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.   Made 6 mini loaves and one 9 x5 loaf.

I thought the recipe was bland. It needs more spices. Using egg substitute is pretty weird. I also put the walnuts throughout the bread instead of ontop. My mother and roomate thought it was top dollar though.

This is an excellent recipe, and I've tried several variations on it, all with great success. I've used whole eggs, I've omitted the zest, and I always reconstitute dried cranberries instead of using sauce. It seems like you can't mess this one up!
