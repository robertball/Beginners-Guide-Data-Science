This a great venison dish!  The only issue I had was with the noodles.  They came out kind of mushy.  Next time I will cook them seperately.  But, that being said, this the flavor of the meat was perfect!

This was very good except for one thing.  I used the whole wheat noodles, and added them to the crockpot for 30 minutes.  They were gross, and turned to mush.  Next time, I will just boil the egg noodles separately.  The flavor was good, but I was extremely disappointed in the noodles.

My family loved this recipe.  I added a little red pepper for kick, shell pasta and ground venison since that's what I had.  Thanks!

Excellent.  Used 8 oz fresh mushrooms, Better Than Bouillon - vegetable for broth.  Pebnne Ritoni whole wheat pasta.  After browning venison - made think sauce from drippings.  Cooked pasta briefly before adding to crockpot.

Delicious, used  2 old gamey fillets but by the time it finished it was sensational. Highly recommended.

I used 1 1/2 pounds of pre-cooked frozen meatballs and egg noodles. Turned out very good.

Not bad, still missing something even after I doctored it up a little.  Or maybe it was the meat.  It was a mix of deer, elk, and beef that I needed to use up before it got too old.  I added two cloves of fresh minced garlic, and worchestire sauce to my taste.  Only put 4 oz of mushrooms in because its all I had.  Also skipped the step of browning the meat because I was short on time. Def was to try it the next time.  Made Amish white bread with this and it made it work, also from allrecipes.com.

This was excellent!  I'm not the biggest fan of venison, but this was wonderful and very easy to make!  No gamey taste whatsoever.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Maybe because this was our first venison in years, but this didn't appeal to us.

This was our first venison recipe ever... we wanted to ease ourselves into it. It was delicious. We used light sour cream, which is perhaps why it came out really thin. It was quickly resolved with some cornstarch. The recipe makes a ton of sauce. We had enough for two dinners, two lunches, and a container to freeze. Thanks for the recipe!

I took everyone's advice and cooked the noodles separately. I added some extra seasonings and cream of mushroom soup.  Towards the end, I added the sour cream, but it was still a little watery, so I added a tsp of cornstarch. Very good flavor!!

I made this with ground deer meat and it was wonderful (and I do NOT like the gamey taste of venison.  Don't know if it was browning it, crockpotting it, LOL or the other ingredients that made it great but thanks!!
