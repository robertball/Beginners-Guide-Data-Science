Delicious!  I had left over garlic mashed potatoes and left over cooked salmon so only had to make the bread crumb mixture.  We had them poolside with a light fruit  salad and ice tea......will do this again.

I love this recipe...I do it almost the same except sometimes I use mayo instead of egg. I think it is more flavorful and easier. If usually pan-fry the salmon or bake it because I think it has more flavor. To add season I use parsley, roasted garlic, and when I want an asian kick, I use minced ginger, soy sauce and cilantro and panko instead of regular bread crumbs. A must try and never skimp by using canned salmon. Salmon is so easy to find now and if you shop around you can usually find it for a very reasonable price.

These are really good.  This is an expensive recipe by using the salmon, but it's worth it.  I did have 2 of my cakes disintegrate in the frying pan while cooking but the rest made it.  They are really good reheated after storage.  They seem to hold together better.

These were good - don't know if I had the proportions exact but close enough.  Great use of leftover salmon.

These fish cakes were absolutely delicious!! I made it exactly how the recipe states, except used some leftover trout instead of salmon. These were better than any fish cake I've ordered at a restaurant. Will definitely be making these again and again.

SO GOOD!!! I made these for my 7-yr old grandson & he ate FOUR (& he's not that big an eater)! He loved them! I served them with sour cream mixed with a little dill pickle juice, dill weed and Old Bay.  

I made 1/2 recipe (10 cakes). I used panko & roasted red instead of green pepper. I couldn't really taste the pepper so I'll make sure I have green for the next go. I mixed the potato & egg together before adding the veg &, next time, I'll also mix the veg well before I add it to the potato/egg. I found that *folding* the veg/potato mix into the salmon worked well. About 10 folds & it was ready. I molded the cakes into a 1/4 cup measuring cup & gave the cup a good "thunk" to get the cake to release. 

Even though I gave it 5 stars, I think I'll halve the amount of potato next time & add another egg. I could taste the mash more than I wanted (too much I thought) & another egg might help hold them together better. Also, I will start each batch with fresh butter & oil. I used olive oil. I found with the second batch that, even though I added some more butter & oil, the original butter had browned to a point where the second batch came out pretty dark. 

I also used (go ahead purists, shoot me) canned Alaskan wild salmon. I use Costco's Kirkland brand. It is 90% as good as poaching fresh and I doubt if fresh would make a difference (Kirkland is a completely different canned salmon than anything you'd get in a grocery store). 

I think whitefish or crab would work here too.

Delicious! Added parmesan cheese to the mixture and reduced the amount of onions. I think I will add a little more seasoning for the next batch, but otherwise they were great!!!

This recipe was amazing! I didn't have celery or peppers, but next time I make these I will definitely include them! I am a poor college student so I only used 2 (4 oz salmon fillets) with the rest of the ingredients the same. I made 5 patties. I fried them in butter/olive oil. The sauce is a homemade dill sauce (mayo, milk, mustard, fresh dill, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper).

This recipe is good.  I like all the ingredients but I found I had to dip the patties in beaten egg and then in the bread crumbs so they would stay together when frying.  I used a combination of Panko bread crumbs, corn flake crumbs and home made bread crumbs and it worked very well. Oh, and I used my own canned fish instead of cooking the fish fresh.

Very good! Added an extra egg (was crumbling in pan), and also added some breadcrumbs to the mix itself as well as dipping them. Also used some Rachael Ray seafood seasoning and Old Bay. Delish!

It's a wonderful recipe. Very very tasty.
Loved them but might add a little extra moisture next time.

These were very good.  I used canned salmon as it's what I had.  I'm sure if I had followed the recipe exactly and used fresh fish it would have rated a five, so that's what I gave it.  Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe.

Wonderful!! I used a mix of my canned salmon and smoked salmon and added a tablespoon of capers. 
Topped with my smoked salmon cream cheese, fresh spinach, and poached eggs, it was amazing!

As written fall apart, mixture too moist and do not cook throughly. Vegetables raw.   Added flour, another egg.  Cooked without breading in three cups oil alone. Much better results.  Sprinkled Old Bay on patties after cooking, taste great.

flavour was great but mine fell apart during cooking.  

I would not recommend tasting when adding the salt and pepper as you already have raw egg in the mixture.

This was super delicious. I think next time I might add a few more bread crumbs. As far as cooking instructions go I might just sear the patties on both sides and then put them in the oven for about 15 minutes. I will probably also sauté the veggies before mixing them with the tuna.

Yes, just what I had in the fridge... Dijon mustard, mashed potatoes, raw egg, bread crumbs, S&P, fried till golden
