This recipe was a 'hit' at school for our teacher's breakfast.  The second time I made it, I was more careful with the syrup mixture to make sure it didn't boil and that way it didn't get so hard and chewy.  I sprayed my glass dish with pam and it did not stick.  I also added a dash or two of cinnamon to the egg mixture and it was excellent.  Definitely a quick and easy dish to make and very easy to increase or decrease the size!!

Don't waste your time or ingredients on this. I followed the recipe exactly as directed and couldn't eat it. It was soggy and looked like a sponge that needed to be wrung out. Besides that,the pan was a PAIN to clean! The syrup mixture hardened up so fast and needed a chisel to break it apart!

I had my two grandkids, my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law all here for the weekend and was looking for something quick and easy to serve for Sunday breakfast that would please all.  Well this recipe fit the bill.

I made the french toast exactly as the recipe called for but i used regular store bought sliced cracked wheat bread instead of the unsliced white bread.  I also buttered the baking dish before putting any ingredients in it.

Everyone loved it, and my sister-in-law took the recipe home with her to try it herself.

I was hoping to see how any leftovers would reheat in the microwave but needless to say there wasn't a scrap left to reheat.

I will definitely make this again and thank you for making our Sunday morning so enjoyable.

This is a good recipe,an alternative to egg casseroles, however I would recommend covering the casserole with foil wrap during cooking.  I used challah bread and cut into thick slices and the top/bottom was crusty and hard.

I thought this recipe was fabubous! I loved the syrup! However, I did make a few modifications. I added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I sprayed the bottome of a glass 9"x13" pan w/cooking spray. I let the syrup mixture come to a boil before I poured it into the pan. I layered sliced french bread, crust on, over the syrup and then poured the milk egg mixture over that. I let it sit covered overnight in the fridge. The next morning, I placed the glass pan containing the french toast into a metal pan filled with 1/2" of water. I baked it in the oven, covered, for 30 min. I then uncovered the dish and baked it for an additional 20 min. It came out fantastic! The caramel syrup didn't stick to the pan at all and the bread was lightly toasted on top. This is one of my favorite new recipies and I know I'll make it again and again.

This is fantastic.  Great even with crusts left on the bread.  Try variations using cinnamon toast or fruit.

I used challah bread with crust, and baked it covered with foil until the last 20 minutes.
The trick to keeping the syrup from candying/burning is to bake it in a "bain marie." It turns out perfectly as it should be: custard like french toast in pure buttery, syrupy sweetness.

**** Bain Marie (water bath) A cooking method where "one container with food to be cooked is placed in another, larger pan containing water... This method of cooking surrounds the food with very gentle heat and is used for cooking delicate dishes like custards..."

I made this for New Years day breakfast for a bunch of party goers and everyone loved it.  It was very easy to make, although I did not trim the crust of the bread.

Thought this would go over better with my kids but they couldn't stand it. I had to cook mine a lot longer than the recipe said to do. My husband and I liked the caramel flavor a great deal and think this would be nice for a brunch.

My family loves this dish.  After making it the second time I did butter the pan first.  We substituted a loaf of regular white bread so it did take a bit longer that way.

Very good custard/creme brulee' consistency.  We made it with the following modifications: Add 3 T water to sugar topping mixture & microwave 1 min. and STIR  till sugar is totally dissolved.  Pour into well sprayed glass pan and let stand for 10 min. Use enough bread to make 3 layers sprinkling cinnamon between layers. Make custard mixture with 6 eggs, 1 T. vanilla, 1 c . half&half, 1 1/2 c. milk and 1/3 cup Splenda instead of sugar if you want to decrease overall sugar calories (does it matter @ this point?) SLOWLY pour custard mixture over bread. Cover and chillovernight. Dot top with butter & bake at 350 for 50 minutes. Invert on serving plate to serve. ENJOY!

Delicious!  I made one minor change.  I used whole wheat bread instead of white bread because I prefer meals with higher fiber content.  Very, very tasty!!!

This was really good. Something quick and easy, but not a huge fan of how sweet it was and the Husband didn't like how soft it was in the middle. I toasted and double layered some left-over white bread because I needed to use it up, and I wonder if that's why it was a little squishy in the middle. It did get pretty hard on the top from baking which was good, but the center just wasn't done enough... Probably not the recipes fault.

Wonderful and quick weekday, weekend, or holiday breakfast.  Top (corn syrup, brown sugar, and butter) are same ingredients for caramel corn topping.  Really good!!!

This is really great if done properly. I turn the oven to 400 and it helps with the sogginess factor. I also cut the milk down to 3/4 cup. It is extremely sweet but worth it once and awhile. The syrup is great to make on its own for waffles, pancakes, etc.

I'm in a quandary over this recipe.  While the taste is unique and not unpleasant, it would best be described as a caramel breakfast custard as apposed to a "french toast".  These are the things that I think make the best casserole.  Use substantial bread, like a pan french loaf (crust on or off doesn't seem to make much difference).  I have added chopped pecans over the caramel and prefer it this way.  As per the recipe - I don't simmer the caramel - but just melt the sugar and butter together until well melted, then your caramel won't candy and crystalize on you.  I have also thought that maybe next time I would make in individual ramekins and serve individually.  This recipe definately has potentential.

I make this every year for Christmas Day.
Excellent with cinnamon raisin bread for at least one of the layers.  I sprinkle cinnamon between the layers of bread, also.  Bake it on the middle rack or higher to keep the sugar from burning.

First time we tried it it was a bit runny.  Second time we cut the bread to 1" thickness (left the crust on), and increased the eggs to 7.  It baked up perfectly.
Other options: add chopped nuts to the syrup layer, and/or sprinkle cinnamon on top before baking.

My version is ever so slightly different in ingredient amounts.  2 Tbl lt corn syrup, 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup lt brown sugar, 1 loaf sliced bread (crust on) 6 eggs 1 1/2 Cup milk 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt.  
It has become a "mandatory" covered dish for our office Christmas breakfast, and for my family for Christmas morning.  
We love it....also can serve with sliced bananas or chopped walnuts or pecans but we like it plain best of all.

The carmel was good but it used so many eggs that it was like a mushy custard or something, it was like wet bread.

This is a GREAT breakfast recipe.  Even my picky 5-year-old loved it! We ate it with fresh strawberries. I used sourdough bread, which worked great (I did not trim the crusts). A definite must-try!

Wow! This was the best french toast I've made! I used thick slices of old french bread and next time I will increase the syrup and egg/milk mixture and I'll try adding fruit.  I think the trick to not harden the syrup is not to over boil it or simmer for more than a couple minutes. Thanks!

I had something similar to this recipe from a restaurant one time and absolutely loved it.  I searched and found this recipe which tastes as close as possible to what the restaurant served.  Everyone I know loves it and when I brought it into work people would fight over the last piece.  I use it for special holidays and to serve when we have a large amount of people over.

AWESOME! I used regular store bought sliced bread and removed the crusts. For the egg mixture I used farm fresh eggs but reduced the milk a tad to a little over a cup. I added cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  Also I didn't let the syrup mixture simmer I just melted the butter with the sugar and used PAM on the dish first...a MUST with this dish. A new favourite - very fattening but very good!

This was awesome!!  I followed the recipe exact, except using a little bit larger slices of cinniman-swirled bread and it was perfect!  The sauce was perfectly crunchy and gooey- my husband still needed maple syrup, but not me.  This is my NEW Night-Before-Christmas recipe.

Very good! But I would definitely recommend keep the syrup in the cabinet, the condiment overdoes it. Other than that, absolutely DELICIOUS. OH! Don't forget your powdered sugar.

This was amazingly great!  I followed recipe exactly with the exception that I had no corn syrup, so I substituted simple syrup I had on hand.  My only problem with the recipe was user error--I didn't seem to have enough liquid to completely cover or soak all the bread, but I think I had too much bread.  This is incredibly easy.  Made night before, and served it on New Year's Day for my family.  It was hard for us to stop from gorging ourselves on this!  Will definitely be making again!

This recipe tasted good but was very boring.  Nothing to it.  There was no wow factor.  It was not a hit to the large New Years brunch group we had.  In fact, I noticed that much of it was left of the plates when people finished.

Very good french toast casserole recipe.  I used challah.  It is kind of like a caramel french toast.  Really is best if inverted over a serving tray.  Very rich but good.

Love this recipe I did change a few things I followed from a previous review (dianetampa)..... some reviews stated tht the syrup was hard I didn't have that problem you have to make sure not to boil the syrup.......I was also out of real milk and half and half so I used a dry milk1 1/2 c and canned evaporated milk 1c........ I was also out of corn syrup so I had to subsitute by making a simple syrup of 2T of sugar and 3T of water and simmering it.... when I layered the bread (soft oatmeal bread) I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on each layer I also added abt a teaspoon of each 2 the custard mixture..baked @ 350 for 50 mins.

This was excellent. It went over well with the kids and adults alike. I used a day old Tuscan loaf and left the crusts on, as the texture is nice once cooked. I also added cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture. For those who believe it to be too soggy, try increasing the cooking time. Mine was in the oven almost an hour and came out perfectly all the way through.

I followed the recipe exactly.  My bread was still soggy and wet at the end of time.  Left it in longer and it puffed up nicely.  Caramel sauce tasted great but was so stuck on pan I had to wash it 3 times.  I will try making some changes next time.

Similar to creme brulee french toast, but with milk instead of half and half.  I like the fact it feels healthier because of the lighter ingredients.  I didn't overnight it but it still worked.

This was a great basic recipe!! I made the recipe as written, with the following additions. I added 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon  of nutmeg to the egg mixture. I added 2 Tablespoons of dark rum to the caramel mixture after removing it from the stove. After I spread the mixture into the pan, which I sprayed with coconut oil, I sliced 3 ripe bananas over the top. I baked the dish for 30 minutes covered, in a bath of water(about 2 inches) and then removed the foil and put 6 pats of butter(quartered) over the top of the dish and put bake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.  The dish came out delicious!!! The only thing I would do different the next time, is use challah bread and leave the crust on.  Omitting the crust from any type of bread, in my opinion is a big mistake.

I have been making Skier's French Toast for over 20 years for many happy and grateful people! My kids called this their very favorite breakfast food for as long as they were growing up! Now I am begged by my English students to please, please bring it for food days! It always turns out perfect and perfectly yummy! I do add cinnamon to taste, just personal preference. To the person who said it was like a soggy sponge that she couldn't eat: did you happen to consider that perhaps you did something wrong? Because I have made this dozens, and dozens, and dozens of times, and it is always wonderful.

Ok, I took out the vanilla and added 1 TSP of cinnamon. Definitely take the crust off, it gets really chewy and use white bread, I tried whole wheat and its flavor was to much. Kids loved it, and I liked that this dish made french toast day much less messy at the table. Next time I am going to put crumbled cooked bacon between the layers, that way it is truly a one pan breakfast.

This is a pretty easy recipe to make. Followed the recipe almost to the letter. I used pre-sliced texas toast (with crusts cut off), and baked 5 min longer than the recipe states. I also used half light and dark brown sugar. The topping tasted great. It had a nice caramel flavor to it that was amazing. The top toasted a little bit, but the problem I encountered was the texture of the bread. It was very custard like, very soggy, and tasted eggy, and while it didn't taste bad, the effect was off putting. I'm going to try reducing the milk and egg next time, and maybe leave the crust on to see if that helps. Otherwise, not a bad recipe.

I found this really good. The tin foil is a great idea but should be taken off 10 minutes prior to  finish so it can crisp the bottom a bit. I also plan to layer the sauce that was put strictly on the bottom between the several layers of bread too a bit so it isn't just a topping.

I made this recipe  for a brunch for 8 people.  The only changes I made,increase the amounts of everything by 1/2, broke the bread into chunks instead of slices and put it in a lasagne pan. Oh so delicious. I lined a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and turned the, Pam sprayed, pan onto the cookie sheet. I was quite surprised that it was NOT too sweet.
