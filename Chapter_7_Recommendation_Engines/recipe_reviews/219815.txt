I followed the recipe exact, making no changes or substitutions. I did make muffins out of this batter, I got 12 regular sized muffins out of one recipe. Right before baking, I sprinkled each mound with a little cinnamon/sugar. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at 23 minutes. The muffins looked very pretty (with the cinnamon/sugar on top, the tops looked like snickerdoodles!) and tasted good but for us, it wasn't a favorite. No reflection on the recipe, it just wasn't a home run for us.

Delicious! I did make alternations after reading reviews. Added 1tsp baking powder instead of baking soda. Creamed the butter 1c brown sugar 1c sugar 1/2tsp vanilla extract added eggs one @ a time. I also mashed 4 bananas with my hands so it stayed chunky I added pecans instead of walnuts! I can't wait to share with my family thanks!

Had spotty bananas to use up and wanted a new recipe.  Finding this one without a picture or a review is how I made my choice.  This is a nice and moist banana bread that sliced nicely.  I froze a couple of loaves for my son and they thawed nice without getting that wet feeling to the outside of the bread.  I made 3 small loaves (3 1/2 x 6) two without the nuts for my son and 1 with nuts.  Thanks ccole6 for sharing your recipe.

This was moist & browned nicely, but the top of mine turned out very sticky, even though I waited until it was totally cooled off to cover it. Also, the texture was too spongy.

This is the only banana bread recipe I use.  Been making it for years.  My kids just love it, but sometimes I add a 1/2 cup of apple sauce to make it a little more moist.

This was excellent recipe followed recipe as listed. I didnâ€™t have cup of walnuts so I mixed pecans to equal. Worked out fine.

PERFECT! I baked as posted other than to add 1 cup of semi-sweet morsels. I made 18 muffins with this recipe.

This is a very easy and good banana bread recipe.  This reminds me of a banana cake my mother would always make to use up any ripe bananas that we're around.  She would always use the cider vinegar and milk in her recipe too.  My only concern is that it didn 't rise and came out pretty flat.  Delicious anyways.  My daughter loves anything banana and asked me to make this for her again next week.  Also, I appreciate all if the comments from those of you who have made this before......Thank you .

my 11 year old daughter has made this twice and followed the recipe as is. Both times it was perfect. I am trying it myself and adding pumpkin seed nuts along with the walnuts.
