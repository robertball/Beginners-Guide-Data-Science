Happy Chanukah in October?  I made these because they sounded delicious and indeed they are!  I didn't have orange juice, but did have orange extract.  It gave them a nice subtle orange flavor, and the house smells wonderful.  I have no sense of depth, so some of mine are rolled too thick, and some too thin.  The too thin are actually perfect.  They're very crisp, got nicely brown around the edges, and held their shape very well.  I was concerned with no chill time for this dough that they'd expand, but most of mine were fine.  The ones that were too thick did spread a bit but that was my fault.  The dough was easy to work with, too.  I lightly floured my rolling surface, and they were easy to peel off and bake.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe since cutout cookies are usually a real pain to me.  But I'll make these again for sure.

As this was posted when the holiday was almost over I am certainly baked out but I have saved it for next year.  The ingrediants appear to be very child friendly in terms of a sturdy dough and the orange juice will give a bright flavor.  This would be a good child friendly base for hamentaschen also.

Loved these cookies! They were such a hit the first time that we made 2 batches! The orange juice is a great touch. They are almost like the orange juice cookies in Modern Jewish Cooking - but better.

This is the exact recipe I grew up with.  The recipe was on the lid of the box of my mom's Chanukah cookie cutters.  They are good cookies if you like crispy cookies to dunk in your tea.  My mom always sprinkled the cookies with blue colored sugar before baking. I find this dough a pain to work with.  It is too sticky and then if you add more flour it ruins the taste.

I had a slight problem with the dough after the wet and dry were mixed, it got clumpy and hard to work with. I added the egg whites for moisture and managed to shape them into balls. After the baking process, the cookies turned out well. They are good without frosting and have a mouthwatering smell!

These cookies were moist and very good. I added homemade icing just for x-mas flare, and that was literally just "icing on the cake" . WIth or without, these cookies are great!!!!

Thank you for this recipe. I made these cookies twice as sugar cookies adding a frosting that I made on my own. The last time for Thanks Giving. I shaped them into menorahs, hearts, mooses, and people using cookie cutters that I have had for a while and finally decided to use them. I will be making more cookies without frosting as butter cookies tonight for my Hanukkah party that will be tomorrow. I will shape them as driedels and menorahs. I love these cookies. I put the dough in the freezer for about Happy Hanukkah, eighth night. :)

Nice small batch recipe for roll out cookies. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a nice sugar cookie, but most recipes make enough to feed 40 people. :) Love that these can be rolled out without refrigeration and that they aren't too sweet.

These came out great! I'm about to make them again right now!Some advice I have to make these successfully is to put down more than a light dusting of flour when you roll out the dough. This will make it much easier to cut out the different cookie shapes. Also, I made an icing for them by mixing together some milk, powdered sugar, and a little vanilla extract. If you decide to make this icing, you could also add coco powder instead of vanilla for a chocolat flavor.

There could be a bit more flavor. I brushed the tops with egg whites and sprinkled with sugar before I baked them and that helped.

Excellent simple recipe. Loved that we didn't have to refrigerate the dough (always the worst part when my seven year old is helping cook). Perfect recipe as is! Thanks so much!

Due to ingredients on hand, I substituted 1/2 tsp almond extract for the orange juice, 1 generous Tbsp shortening and 3/4 stick butter (instead of the whole stick of butter) I was pressed for time, so I rolled into small balls and pushed down with the prongs of a fork (instead of rolling out and using cookie cutters). 

They were amazing!!  I also only baked 1/2 the recipe at a time, and put the other 1/2 of the dough in the fridge to use the next day.  They were quick, easy, and yummy!  I posted on Facebook, I loved them so much!!

I was skeptical about cut-out cookie dough that did not require refrigeration, but I was proven wrong!!  These are fantastic and so easy.  The cookies held their shape perfectly when cooked.  Only change was the use of orange extract instead of juice. Also I failed to pay attention and whipped the yolks, butter, sugar and extracts together and then sifted in the dry ingredients (as opposed to adding the yolks one at a time). Thankfully, the oversight didn't hurt the finished product at all.  This recipe is a keeper!!

These cookies were really good! I even put a Hersheys Kiss in the middle on some, and colored sugar on others. They were amazing cookies that I will definitely make again!

Cookies came out delicious! But I'm wondering why it didn't tell me to add another cup of flour. It so sticky almost like cream. I also had to bake it for a much longer time.

These are great cookies .... but, not exactly Chanukah cookies. At Canukkah, Jews observe the custom of eating fried foods in commemoration of the miracle associated with the Temple oil.Pastries made for Chanukah should be  deep-fried symbolizing the miracle of the burning oil lamps in the ancient Holy Temple in Jerusalem which should have lasted 1 day, and instead lasted 8 days. giving enough time to make oil suitable for the Holy altar.

very nice but don't store with other cookies as the orange flavor is absorbed by others.     Several people tried these and thought the flavor and texture was very good.

I use this recipe for all of my holiday decorated cookies... it is simple to throw together and easily rolls out right away - no chilling required. Everyone who has tried them has raved about them. I make them exactly as the recipe indicates and they are perfect every time!
