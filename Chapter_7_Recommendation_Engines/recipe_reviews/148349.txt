I looooooooove cranberries, so this was great.  Changed a few things.  Didn't have the pie spice, pecans or egg, so I added a bit more cinnamon, chopped up an apple to add to the mix, and used egg beaters.  Also drizzled the top with honey and put it in an 8x8 pan.  Increased the bake time to 20-25 minutes so the middle would cook.  Found that with the addition of the apples it was awesomely sweet (just right for my taste).  However, I have some friends doing Weight Watchers and plan to try some adjustments next time for them.  Will try applesauce instead of butter, honey instead of sugar (and lessen the amount since I'm adding apples), and leave the peels on the apples (and add another half an apple)  to add even more of a fiber kick.  Think they will love it as much as I did!  Great recipe.  :)

It was a nice recipe. A good alternative to cookie/brownies. I made 2 batches, 1 as directed, the other I substituted honey (and a dash of molasses) for the sugar and unsweetened applesauce for the butter. That second batch was slightly fluffier, moist and chewy, not crumby at all (the first was). i did omit the nutmeg and pie spice on both. I will try again with even less honey and banana chips, chocolate chips instead of cranberries/nuts. Healthier option than breakfast bars for the kids.

Fantastic recipe! Very easy! I added an extra egg and increase baking soda, baking powder and salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  The bars came out more cake-like. It was a great late night snack for me and the husband!

I was really excited to try this recipe due to the other great reviews.....I have to say it's fairly bland for my taste, not sweet enough, and the texture is more like a health food bar than a 'cookie' type bar....I wouldn't make this for kids, although if you're dieting and desperate these might fit the bill.

Follow up: I tried these the next day and was very dissapointed. They're too chewy, dry and I dont feel they're worth the time and effort.

I have made these both ways. The first batch I made exactly as the recipe was written, except I did add some dark chocolate chips. The next day, I made them using honey instead of brown sugar, and applesauce instead of butter. To me, both ways are fabulous.  I will probably stick to the second method, just for the healthier outcome.  They went over better for my kids when I chopped up the dried cranberries. These are what we use as a pick-me-up after our Zumba class every week.  Thanks for a great recipe!

very tasty!  My kids and the kiddos I watch loved them.  Moist and not too sweet. Even my husband the sweet tooth in the house liked them.

Really yummy, I used canola oil and yogurt instead of egg and butter. A very simple and tasty recipe.

I made this exactly as directed! The result was exactly as described, a moist tart and sweet cranberry oatmeal bar cookie. It was a great way to use up the dried cranberries I had and I believe I will use this recipe again.

Ooof.  Would have been very bland if I hadn't added the honey and applesauce and apples and extra cranberries.  Will try again with dried apricots and mangoes with pecans.  An okay base recipe to launch from.

The taste was fine, like a decent oatmeal cookie, but the texture and mouthfeel was awful -- dry and heavy.  Absolutely would not make this again.

I followed recipe as instructed and the bars were nearly inedible. They came out dry, crumbly, with not enough sweetness or mouth feel. Like previous reviewers mentioned, they tasted like a weird diet "fat-free" dessert, except, of course, they're not fat free or healthy. Definitely will not be saving this one to my recipe box. Don't waste ingredients on this one!

Not my favorite....at all.  I switched the cranberries for blueberries...which was a good choice for me.  But they are not sweet at all, and they are so crumbly and dry. To make them more tasty, I cut them up, then drizzled dulce de leche syrup all over them before serving.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have the pecans so I left them out and I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves.  This was very easy and have added it to my regular menu!

I was very excited to find this recipe and ended up disappointed. I was looking for something easy to make to have on hand in the morning to grab & go. I love cranberries so this seemed perfect. It was easy enough to put together... no electric mixers or electric anything needed. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand. My mouth was watering when I pulled it out of the oven. I flipped it out of the pan after cooling & cut into bars with a large knife. It was here that I had the first indication something was amiss. It was very crumbly. Soooo crumbly that many of the bars couldn't hold their shape. When I took a bite, there was more crumbling. Definitely had to wash this down with milk. I was hoping for a moister even gooier texture.

I love these. I had to improvise the recipe a little. Since I didn't have some ingredients. I used 1/2 cup of natural applesauce instead of the butter. I substituted the sugar for maple syrup, and I used 1 teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa for pumpkin pie spice. They turned out delicious and not dry at all. On the contrary, they were moist. Next time, I am going to ad almonds. :)

Good but not as thick as I had hoped. And not crunchy which wasn't bad. R was totally into them.

This wasn't bad, but not what I was anticipating. Maybe it's because I used quick oats? But it was very chewy & cake like. Definitely something I would serve at a brunch & not as dessert.  It's not very sweet which is nice though. But the flavor didn't wow enough to make again here.

With hectic mornings, we had little time for breakfast or lunch packing. We were spending a fortune on bought cereal bars. NO MORE!!! These are fantastic, easy to make, and customizable!! The first batch I made per the recipe except with applesauce instead of butter. I'm very pleased! Now...I hope my fiance will be as happy when he gets home!

This was nice for breakfast. Easy to mix up and fast to bake. I had no pecans or pumpkin spice and it still tasted great.  I just added extra oatmeal and cranberries to replace the pecans. It is pretty sweet, but not too much that you feel you are eating desert. It also turned out very soft for me. These bars would be tasty crumbled over yogurt too.

Like other reviewers I added an extra egg and increased the amount of baking soda, baking powder, and salt to make a "cakier" bar. These are great!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using raisins instead of cranberries. The flavor was fine but the bar is crumbly; it doesn't hold together at all. Won't make it again.

These were delicious and flavourful. Mine were a little soft, even though I cooked them for longer than stated, but I will try again soon. This will be a regular and good to experiment with.
