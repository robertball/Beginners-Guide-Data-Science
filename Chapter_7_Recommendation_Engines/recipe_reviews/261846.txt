This is a good, quick bar cookie mix. They are too sweet for me though. I left off the frosting. Just the toffee bits and nuts would have been plenty for me. I mixed the chips in the batter as I figured we'd like them better that way. My husband has a big sweet tooth, so I'm sure he will love these.
