This soup is wonderful! I only had an 8 oz. package of mushrooms at my disposal, so I cut the recipe in half, and then added a can of mushrooms to make up the full amount. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written, and it came out absolutely delicious! I did let it sit overnight, which helped the flavors meld nicely. I really enjoyed this soup, and would make it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

This completely rocked my world!  I was a little concerned with the lack of spices. I made it as directed, but I pumped up the garlic.  So, so, so, so good!

Absolutely delicious, low fat recipe.  I made a few changes: I didn't have celery, so I used fresh red pepper instead, I added garlic, I have tons of home grown tomatoes and I used them, instead of tomato paste.  I used baby bella and shitaki mushrooms, this was particularly important because they give less water than button mushrooms, but since I didn't use tomato paste I figured that would be fine. I used a bunch of different fresh herbs (didn't measure) from my garden, including basil, Italian parsley, oregano.  Also, I added some cooked, chopped chicken. I almost forgot, prior to adding the chicken I used an immersion blender lightly, just to thicken things a bit more, but left the whole thing very chunky.

The result was a soup that was a low fat, low carb meal!  Thanks for the recipe.

For now on I'm making this soup the day before I need it because it was so much better the next day for lunch. I wish I would have listened to many of the reviewer when they said to add garlic. Next time I will add the garlic  when I saute the onions and celery.

I thought this was just OK. I used chicken stock instead of beef broth, maybe thats why I didnt like it that much. I thought it was bland. I added some paprika and worcestershire sauce and I still feel like its missing something. I hope it will taste better in a few hours after the flavors meld a bit.

This recipe is a very solid, basic recipe, but like the other reviewers, I kicked it up a bit.  I used mushroom broth and shitakes.  I added garlic, cayenne and about two tsps of white wine worcesterhire sauce.  To serve, I topped with toasted baguette and grated gruyere.  Perfect!

This was a very good soup and easy to make.  I sauteed the onions and celery until they browned (adding another flavor component).  Then I added sliced button mushrooms and baby portabellas.  I sauteed those until all the liquid was gone.  Then I added the carrots, beef broth and some marinara sauce since I didn't have any tomato paste.  I let that cook together for awhile.  I gave it a little puree with the hand blender.  This thickened it up some so I had to add more broth.  Then I made the barley and added it to the soup.

I have been using this recipe since last winter.  It is a real winner.  I too, have added my own touches like cayenne pepper and using chicken or vegetable stock for a base.  I have shared this recipe at the gym and also got positive feedback.

I agree with one of the other reviewers--I thought this might be a bit bland as it didn't have any spices added, but this was GREAT!  The only change I made was omitting the celery and substituting with quartered crimini mushrooms.  Easy to make, and low in fat and calories, too. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I recommend using vegetable broth, homemade if possible.  The beef broth doesn't support the veggie goodness of this soup.  Needs to be served with a hearty bread.

My family loved this recipe! I loved the flavor that the tomato paste added. I added 1 pound of ground turkey and a few cloves of crushed garlic. It was a great soup for a crisp fall day!

This was really great, I did add some garlic and some crumbled, browned sage sausage to bulk it up.  Also chopped up two large portabellas to add to it and it was a big hit.  Fed my roommates and I (3 people total) lunch and dinner for 3 days! Will make again!

This is an excellent recipe for soup.  I combined this recipe with the Swiss-Mushroom Barley soup recipe on this site.  I used the regular pearl barley and added a little milk and shredded swiss cheese.  I doubled the recipe and it was a hit!

I followed the recipe exactly and it had no flavor other than the overwhelming flavor of the tomato paste.  A waste of time and money

This soup is beautiful---and tasty!  The liquid component is a little bit heavy; to make it thicker, I didn't use quite as much water (the barley didn't suffer) and didn't add any vegetable broth---instead of cooking the mushrooms, carrots, onions, and celery in oil, I cooked them in water and used the vegetable broth to cook the barley.  I used a little bit of V8 Tomato Herb soup instead of tomato paste.

This soup is without a doubt, a complete meal.I added minced garlic, but, other than that, I followed the recipe.  I made   Buttery Corn Bread to go with it. Very tasty and a good for you meal!
