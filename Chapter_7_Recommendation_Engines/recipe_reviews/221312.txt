I cut this recipe back by half. This was my first time ever roasting my own roma tomatoes. The directions were simple to follow which I really appreciated. I did use a quality balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil. I made no other changes. This dressing is OUTSTANDING. One of the best dressing's I've ever had. So very simple but incredible flavors. I drizzled some over a bowl of spinach, sliced baby bella andcherry tomatoes--I wanted to lick the bowl. LOVE this dressing.

Absolutely wonderful. I also used Olive oil instead of Canola. The blend is just tangy enough to play well with spinach in a salad. I used herbs from my garden and a good vinegar also. Roasting the veges is the key to this wonderful flavor combo.

We just loved this dressing.  I had to use cherry tomatoes as that is what I had on hand.  This is the only change that I made to this recipe.  It had a deep tangy flavor and we truly enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for posting.

Really good! I halved this and it still made a large amount of dressing. Whole family loves this!
