Instead of the Processed cheese spread I used 1.5 C of shredded cheddar cheese.  After tasting it I added salt, pepper, garlic salt and onion powder.  If you don't use the processed cheese spread it is not salty enough.

This dish was fantastic! I used fresh broccoli florets instead of frozen and baked it an extra 10-15 minutes... until the broccoli was tender. 

I used 8 oz of velveeta cheese instead of the cheese in the jar.

This is the same recipe I've used for a couple of years and it is great. It is also good with cauliflower and sliced carrots in addition to the broccoli. I bake boneless, skinless chicken breast over this and sprinkle a little cheddar cheese over the whole thing. It's always gobbled up in a hurry and is a great way to get kids to eat their vegetables.

This recipe was really good and easy to make.  I didn't have processed cheese on hand, so i used 8oz of shredded cheese and it turned out good.  I also recommend combining all ingredients in a big bowl and then scoop it into the casserole dish.

This is a good recipe, but feel free to use olive oil instead of butter when sauteing the veggies (tasted just as good to me, and a whole lot healthier!). Also, if you want to make this more of a meal in itself, try adding some garlic for a bolder flavor and scooping it into warm pitas with some herbed bread stuffing. Delicious!

It was okay but a little bland.  There was no taste that popped out at you.  It will do for someone who does not have too much time on their hands.  I will probably make it again but with many alterations.   Add more pepper, garlic salt, and vegetables.  Overall, it was not bad but not great.

It wasn't the best I've ever had. I made some before for my husband's Army unit and the soldiers loved it- but I can't find that recipe. This wasn't it. There are better Broc. Rice and Cheese recipes out there.

I included this dish for a meal that I gave to a friend that had just given birth.  She loved it so much that I had to make it for us.  I served it with company here and it was a instant hit again!  Family favorite here.  Even my 3-yr old loved it!

I don't think that broccoli-rice-cheese casseroles are supposed to "pop" with flavor as some people expect...this recipe delivers right on the money and is good old-fashioned comfort food. After the first time I made it (exactly as written), it has been much requested by the men in my family, so much so that I have had to modify it, based on whatever I had on hand, to meet the demand! I have made it with either frozen broccoli or lightly steamed broccoli; with Velveeta or shredded cheddar cheese; regular rice and "instant"/boil in bag rice; and this last time I discovered I was out of cream of mushroom soup so I made an emergency white sauce substitution... and it has come out great each time! I normally use the reduced sodium soup and the salt taste is perfect, no extra needed. Have served it with everything from Thanksgiving dinner to baked fish.

The only thing differently that I did was I added black pepper and I topped it with fried onion rings during the last 10 minutes of cooking!

My Mom has made this for at least 30 years, we call it "Green Rice" in my family. This is always a crowd pleaser, and great with ham during the holidays. I've also taken it to work for holiday potlucks - just prepare through step 4, add to your slow cooker, take it to work and let it heat up in the slow cooker all morning, and you end up with a dish that everyone loves. It won't get the crusty top that it gets when you bake it, but it is still very very good. I've always received a positive response when I bring this to a potluck. Also, it is very easy to double this recipe for a crowd. To me, this is a dish best saved for holidays and potlucks. My boss took some of the leftovers home after a work potluck, and his 4 kids loved it!   As far as the cheese, it seems like there are people who shy away from processed cheese. I like real cheese too, but sometimes the fake stuff is better in a dish, and in this dish, Cheez Whiz is what should be used.

This was pretty darn good once I doctored it up a bit.  As did others, I used shredded Cheddar-Jack cheese in place of the processed cheese spread, adding 1/2 tsp. each garlic salt, onion powder and kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper.  I also added 1 large boneless skinless chicken breast which I oven roasted and diced, and used an entire 14-ounce package of broccoli.  I mixed all in a large bowl before placing in the greased dish (I used a 2-qt. soufflé dish).  I then topped it with a mixture of crushed Ritz crackers, panko crumbs, grated Parmesan, more of the Cheddar-Jack and melted butter.  The casserole baked for 45 minutes without covering and browned nicely without burning.

I sub'd green pepper for the celery since I had that on hand, used the Philadelphia Sante Fe Blend Cooking Creme for the cheese spread and topped with about 1 cup of shredded chedder cheese...it was AWESOME! Very easy and cheap to make and very flavorful too - exactly what I was looking for tonight! Thanx very much for the recipe! Def. going to be a reg. meal around here from now on :D

I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions: 8 oz. Velveeta for the cheez whiz, I used fresh broccoli since that's what I had on hand, and I added 1/4 cup half and half before baking because it seemed a little dry.  Really good.  Will probably make again.

Very Good- I did make changes. I used chicken base in my water when I cooked my rice. Put everything else plus thyme in my microwave steam bowl. Cooked for 6 min. in microwave. mixed everything, put in cassarole dish, baked 35 min. Very tastey!

My family LOVES this recipe, I made it twice so far and it's just wonderful.. After preparing everything I just sparkled some "Mac & Cheese Mix powder" over the rice and mixed well until it melted and after putting it into the cassarole I sparkled some cheddar cheese over the top..

Wow... just made this... my mom and I both tried it and were all "Mmmm! That's GOOD!" I didn't use processed cheese (used the real stuff) and instead of sauteeing in margarine, I used Earth Balance. I also topped it with bread crumbs... oh and baked for 45 instead of 35 mins.

This was yummy!  I made a serving for 6 and it made a nice 9x9 baking dish, I also used a 15 oz.  can of Rico's  Gourmet Nacho Cheddar Cheese Sauce instead of cheese called for in recipe(I usually find it at Wal-Mart) it's a red and yellow can, also added a little bit of salt and pepper, my guys loved it!!

This is wonderful and makes a great side dish. Kids loved it! I did use 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese in placed of the processed as I'm not a fan of processed cheese. Very good.

This recipe was a huge hit at our house and was delicious! Instead of the canned cheese I used 2 cups of mild cheddar cheese. I also brought my frozen brocoli to a boil, drained the brocoli, and then mixed it with all the other ingredients. Next, I doubled the amount of cream of mushroom soup. Finally, I topped it with crushed up Ritz Crackers and poured 1/4 a cup of melted butter on top of that before baking. It was very easy to make and will definitley be doing it again real soon. Bonus: you could easily make this recipe healthy if need be.

I agree with a few others....however is probably our fault!  I did not use the processed cheese but rather shredded my own.  Smelled great but lacked that punch.  If you dont "follow the recipe", you will need to add some salt, pepper, and garlic!

We use fresh broccoli (steam broccoli first or add more cooking time) and we substitute cream of broccoli soup. Every one was asking for the recipes all night. This broccoli casserole can be a meal in it's self. Next time we make this broccoli casserloe we are going to chang it up a bit more. And make a full meal. We are going to add chicken it to. Then it will be a full meal.

Loved this! I recommend doing what other have done: swap out the processed cheese for 1.5 cups of extra-sharp cheddar. I threw in other veggies as well (some chopped red and green peppers) and it was amazing.

My family is STILL raving about this recipe!  In our area I couldn't find the cheese spread with jalepenos so I just used regular Velveeta and added a couple of tbsp of diced jalepenos.  EXCELLENT!!!

I made a few adjustments here and there to make it like old times. I added a can of broccoli cheese soup. The friends and family really enjoyed it, even my one year old daughter!

Turned out great. Low fat cream of broccoli soup was better for my taste and I used brown rice.  I will sure make it again.  Thanks

My 19-year old son's comment:  I've had this other places and it usually doesn't have any flavor but this is GOOD!

Now - I'm the person who tweaks recipes and for that I apologize to those who believe we must follow a recipe exactly.  My changes/suggestions:  I sauteed onions, celery and green peppers in the butter - about 1/3 of a cup of each.  I used Velveeta cheese which I cut into small pieces and mixed with the other ingredients when I added the rice (to melt the cheese more evenly).  I also added season salt, pepper, a dash of hot sauce, and a dash of garlic powder.

YES! I will make this recipe again and probably frequently because my family LOVED it and they can be very hard to please.

I made a lot of alterations. I used a substitute for the cream of mushroom - a recipe I found online that I also made significant alterations to - it ended up consisting of 1TBSP melted organic margarine melted over low medium heat then added 3TBSP of flour slowly, remove from heat and stir until smooth. Then add 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup of organic vegetable broth, slowly - stir until smooth. Then you can added chopped mushrooms, but I didn't (because I didn't have any on hand). Then return to heat and bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly until it thickens. Then add salt and pepper. 

I also replaced the jarred cheese with shredded cheddar. I added garlic powder and cilantro leaves to the onion/celery mix and used 3TBS olive oil instead of margarine. I baked it for 10 additional minutes and covered it with foil.

I've used brocoli soup instead of mushroom, and it turned out great. I also mix some raclette cheese in the mix and spread parmesano cheese on the top.

This is a great and versital recipe.  I used a Mexican blend of frozen vegitables instead of just broccoli and it gave it a little something extra.  I will definitely use this recipe again esp. for a pot luck!!

Very Good.  My family loved it.  Instead of the jalapeno spread, I used Velvetta that was already in the fridge and sprinkled some shredded cheese on top.

This recipe is just like our family recipe as well.  When my sister requested broccoli casserole for Thanksgiving and we didn't have the recipe with us, I tried this one being that it looked similar.  It turned out great - I left out the celery because several people don't like it, but it was still very good.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because even though it's really good, it doesn't necessarily "wow" me.  Still, I would recommend it to a friend and certainly wouldn't be ashamed to serve it for company or at pot luck dinners.  It's also incredibly easy and quick to make.  And it makes a decent size casserole.  Definitely worth a try!

My husband loved this dish but the kids thought it was a bit spicy.  I could not find the cheese spread w/ jalapeno so I used a few slices of the canned and chopped it in with the broccoli.  Will probably leave out the jalapenos next time so everyone can enjoy.

Good recipe but overly salty in my opinion.  I will try again but will use low sodium soup and fresh cheese with sliced javanero because I like to control the salt portion.

I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup.  I also added cheese to the top for the last 10 minutes of baking.  I was hoping that the cheese would make it more appealing to the small kids.  The adults loved this recipe, however, the kids still didn't care for it much.  We'll make broccoli eaters out of them one of these days.

Used Old English cheese in a jar, but melted it with the onions and butter, which helped in spreading it into the rest of the casserole. Delicious! Will make again.

This was great! I added rotisserie chicken and made it a main course! 

I couldn't find jalapeno Cheese Whiz so I did regular Cheese Whiz and added some canned diced jalapenos. That really gives it a subtle kick and flavor. I also added some crushed Ritz crackers to the top. 

Also, I didn't read the instructions well and just dumped the frozen broccoli in to it and baked it. That made the broccoli more crisp, but we actually liked it better that way.
We'll definitely make this again!

I made this casserole according to the recipe.  I thought it seemed a little bland.  Cheese Whiz is NOT the product it used to be, so I think that may be the reason there isn't a lot of cheese flavor.  If I make this recipe again, I will probably add some real cheese to enhance the flavor.

This wasn't bad. It wasn't omigod crazy delicious, but... it's a rice & broccoli casserole. I added some garlic and onion powder, and salt & pepper for taste. I think it would've been too bland otherwise. I also topped it with bread crumbs for some crunch. The original recipe is okay, just needs tweaking.

I used chopped fresh broccoli, penne pasta and shredded cheddar since I had it all on hand and it was really good... Very versatile recipe! My kids loved it and it's definitely going into the recipe bank! I do suggest adding some milk if you are using real cheese, I added about 1/4 cup.

I used broccoli cheese soup because I don't like mushroom.  I also used 16 oz. process cheese and 16 oz. broccoli since they came in packages that size and I didn't want to waste.  It's a good thing I did that, though, because there was still a ton of rice.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner, well, mostly. Ok, so I switched out some stuff to go with what I had on hand. I would give it 5of5 if I had completely followed the recipe to the letter.

Great recipe!  Only changes I made were to add some shredded cheese and some sliced jalapeno peppers.  Dish was a big hit with the whole family.

Excellent recipe.  I couldn't find the jalapeño cheese, so I substituted 8 oz. Velveeta and added some cayenne pepper.  I also added some leftover cubed ham.  I froze about 2 servings of the casserole uncooked with the directions written out on the top for another time.

This was a good recipe, I would make it again however it took alot of my time preparing it. Probably because it was my first time, I think I could make it quicker my second time. I added chicken pieces to it to make it more of a meal. I used real butter, part of a block of Velveeta, shredded cheddar cheese, and added some celery salt(since I did not have celery) and lots of black pepper. The consistency was perfect, not too dry or mushy like alot of casseroles come out. I mixed everything up in a pot on the stove before I poured it in the pan that I baked in. I'd recommend doing that so you can taste it and add whatever seasoning you want before baking(it is a little bland if you don't do this).

Great way to use all that broccoli that I blanched and froze from the garden last fall.

Excellent base dish that you can modify to suit your individual tastes. I used Mexican Velveeta, which gave it a pleasing taste without heat. If you're looking for some bite, consider using a bit of salsa  in addition.

We have been making this for years. The only difference, is that we omit the broccoli, and add chicken, which we saute with the onions and celery. Then when we pull this out of the oven, we fold into it blanched (15 to 30 sec)
peas and broccoli) Its a little more work but the kids like the deep green color of the vegies better. As a condiment to sprinkle over the top, the adults in our house like, "Sunkist
Almond Accents"

I made changes to keep my kids happy but they loved it. But most important in all our years of marriage (10 years and 6 kids) this is the first time my husband has ever eaten broccoli - I will be making this often!! I left out the celery but used one cream of celery and one cream of mushroom and used half of the cheese hoping to get it a little healthier. Great hit.

Really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few changes to suit my children's taste and what I had on hand.  I added shredded cheddar and used cream of celery instead of adding celery (no cream of mushroom soup).  I also used a 14 oz. pkg of baby broccoli florets.  Great! will make again.

Very tasty.  Only changes I made were to use olive oil instead of margarine and Velveeta instead of cheese spread with jalapenos because that's what I had on hand.  I think we would have liked the addition of jalapenos so will try that next time.  Makes a huge portion!  We have lots of leftovers but that's a good thing.  Will definitely make again.  Update:  After making this many times I tried replacing 1/2 the Velveeta with pepper jack cheese.  What a wonderful change!!  Added just enough spice but really no heat.  We love this and it changed it from 4 stars to 5!
