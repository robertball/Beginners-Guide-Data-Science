I made this as written but subbed EVOO for butter. My husband said it was the best variation of asparagus I've made so far! I will make this again. It's important that you remove the asparagus from heat and wait a moment to add the honey so it doesn't burn!!

I really enjoyed this! I actually added some already cooked chicken strips and a handful of frozen bell peppers to it to make it a meal! Excellent!

Very good! I really likes the sweetness of the honey w/ the spice of the cayenne. I did add some salt, but that was my only addition. I opted to use evoo in place of the butter to keep it healthier (I know the butter would've been even better, lol). The family enjoyed these and I would make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fabulous and *so* easy! Love veggie recipes that take veggies to the next level without a lot of fuss and without disguising or overpowering the natural flavors. This recipe is perfect on both counts. (03.28.15; 03.12.17)

This was REALLY good. I was skeptical because of the honey, but it wasn't over sweet. The honey added just a touch of sweetness to the asparagus. Once I cooked the asparagus as per this recipe, I set it aside and sauteed leeks and shrimp in butter and garlic and tossed everything, asparagus included, into a pan of hot cooked linguine. Fabulous. Thanks so much for the new asparagus idea.

We are not asparagus eaters but I wanted to add more veggies to our family's diet. We normally default to a bag of frozen vegetables that you just pop in the microwave. I tried this recipe because it looked really simple and fast. It was and everyone liked the asparagus!! I think it was the honey that added a little something, plus took away any bitterness from the asparagus. I added it to my "Favorites"!

Excellent flavor! The sweet and spicy work perfectly together. Plus this was so quick and easy. Even my 3 year old who refuses any veggies ate this!

I've made this at least 3 times as recommended. It's quick and so tasty. Great when your pinched for time! My kids (who hate anything green on their plate) beg me to make this all the time.

Delicious! The honey just added the right amount of sweetness. I added a little extra pepper to give it a kick and it was fabulous! Will definitely be a regular from now on.

We liked it, mixed the powder and pepper in a small salt shaker for easy & even distribution. 
Probably use more honey next time but didn't know how much as it was our first time making. 
Made it  with onions & mushrooms to go with filet mignon and a bottle of Caymus for new years eve......
 And indeed it is a Happy New Year!!!

I changed a bit..... Put it in an oven safe dish, heated with my pork roast. When I took it out, I sprinkled a bit of shredded parmesan over it. Now that was some good eatin' .

Made this exactly as the recipe said and it was very good.  I thought it could have used a little more cayenne for my taste but still very good and very easy.  I like to add crumpled feta cheese to asparagus and green bean dishes so I did add that and it was very delicious!

Best asparagus ever!  Love this recipe and lives up to it's name! SUPER EASY and lots of flavor bang for very little effort.  The small amount of honey does such wonderful things to asparagus!  Thanks for sharing!

This was my 2nd time cooking asparagus, ever. And it was a hit!! I accidentally used too much butter, and I had to find a substitute for the cayenne because we didn't have any. (I used some paprika mixed with white pepper.)

Thank you for posting this recipe. It will be something I use again!

I actually enjoyed this but my wife didn't care for the cayenne pepper. It was easy to make and the sweet and spicy did work together. I would make this again.

I normally roast my asparagus in the oven but I was baking something at a high temp so took the opportunity to try this recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written and I thought it was very tasty. Probably not the most diet friendly with the butter and honey, but for something different, this was good.

Very simple and quick. The contrast of the honey and cayenne pepper was a nice change of pace to our regular asparagus recipes.

I was a little nervous with the seemingly odd combination of ingredients but IT WAS WONDERFUL!!! My new way of making asparagus is now my favorite! Sweet and spicy is a great hit at our house, everyone agreed.

Disappointing; I didn't like it at all.  The initial amount of seasonings didn't flavor it nearly enough for my taste; I added a bit more and still didn't care for it.  Giving it two stars because my husband thought it was OK.

Made it exactly as instructed!! FANTASTIC!!  I let the asparagus brown slightly and followed a suggestion to add honey and spices after taking off the heat.  Served it for Easter, and it was a huge hit!! Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely simple and surprisingly good. Didnt turn out sweet like I feared and the cook time of 8-10 mins was perfect for mine. Well balanced. Glad I tried this and now have a new asparagus recipe in my arsenal!

Just o.k...Not much flavor. If I make it again I will double up on the honey, garlic powder, and cayenne.

I didn't make any changes and it was very delicious and easy! I think I'll try using olive oil next time for a bit more healthy recipe.

I will definitely make this again!  We eat a ton of asparagus, this is a great way to change up our usual recipe.  I did have to add just a touch of salt.  I think the butter could easily be replaced by some olive oil.  Such an easy & great tasting recipe!

This is a keeper. Delish and the honey made all the difference. What a nice change to a recipe for this veg. I used garlic salt and it turned out just fine.

We used half butter/half olive oil for cooking the asparagus.  I only usually 'like' asparagus, but this tasted great!

Didn't have cayenne pepper.  That might help a person wake up in the morning too.  I like the honey in this.  It takes out some of the bitterness .

Followed the recipe to the tee and the asparagus turned out absolutely amazing! Served it with breaded pork chops. The sweet and spicy was a perfect combination.
