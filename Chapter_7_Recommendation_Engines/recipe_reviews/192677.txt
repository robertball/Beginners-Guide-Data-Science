Yummiest. Salad. Ever.  I have made it several times now since last summer. I do love it with the shredded mozz, but I think cubed cheese (I like swiss) doesn't get mushy as easily. Truly delicious - the name doesn't do it justice. Even my 19-month-old gobbled it up (except she left the onions behind ;-) The thyme/olive oil/lemon juice combo is just phenomenal!

I left out the hearts of palm because I know my family wouldn't eat it. I did use organic garbanzo beans(they just taste better) and stirred in about a 1/4 c. or so of greek yogurt. I liked this as did my older son. My husband was indifferent. My youngest wouldn't touch it. I think I might keep the basic ingredients of this recipe and perhaps mix this salad with some of 5thsister's greek yogurt dip. NOTE: I cannot stress enough to use fresh spices when you can and organic produce. It does make all the difference.

This was a good salad, but not one I'd go out of my way to make again.  I made the recipe exactly as written. I'd highly recommend adding capers or olives, as suggested in the recipe notes, as it is missing the extra depth of flavor without. The shredded cheese does get mushy if you keep it overnight. In fact, I'd probably just omit the cheese since it doesn't add much to the overall flavor.

This was great! The only change I made was using cannellini beans instead of garbanzo and apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and loved it! Will definitely make this again!

Quick, easy and tasty!  I added a little extra hearts of palm to "up" it a bit.  A great way to take a salad to work for a change of pace!

Great salad, I used the juice from 1/2 lemon which was more like 2 TBSP, organic canned tri-bean blend, and dried thyme. I added fresh cilantro which put this over the top - my picky daughter ate it!

10/10 would recommend. I added a can of olives and instead of cutting up a tomato, I bought grape tomatoes and cut those up. Oh I also added spring mix greens to it as well to give it more of a fresh flavor than a bunch of canned items. Lots of changes but isn't that what a salad is all about

Very good...refreshing on a hot day. Would probably be really good with tuna in it, as well.

I made this for a lunch today. I liked it and would make it again! I added capers and they were great, but I would not use the green olives again. I left out the palm, substituted lemon thyme for regular thyme, and used canned tomatoes in place of fresh ones. This was a great Mediterranean salad--thumbs up!
