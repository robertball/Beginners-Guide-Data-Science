This was very good.  I used vegetable broth instead  water and 1/2 cup each of green peppers, red peppers and mushrooms instead of the broccoli.  Also added a small amount of red onion and a shake of red pepper flakes (sorry, I don't always measure).  Served it over rice (1/2 cup each) point of this is that the two of us ate it all -- it wouldn't have made enough for 4 and we're not really big eaters so you may think of increasing the recipe.  But--maybe we ate more because it's so good.  Lorry

Definitely enjoyable, could easily be adapted to use other veggies.  The veggies really aren't steamed, but this is still a good dish.
