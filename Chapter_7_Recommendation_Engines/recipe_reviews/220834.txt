Loved this meatloaf recipe.  I use a pound of ground venison and a pound of ground sausagee.  Don't know how many oz. of morels, just lined the whole loaf with morels.  This will be great without the morels and the cheese.

I thought this was a great recipe and very flavorful.  Will definitely make again. I made exactly as directed except I used beef and I didn't have bacon so used prosciutto in its place. Very happy with how it came out.

Omg, so delicious. Not the healthiest dish I've cooked, but still so yummy. Only thing I didn't include was the vegetable juice because I didn't have any. I was worried it would be too dry, so I added a little extra ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce as well as a hint of a-1. Can't wait to make again for a holiday or other get-together. Yum!!

I've never cooked with venison before, but chose this recipe when a friend dropped some off to share. This is now requested more often than my meatloaf ever was, a new family favorite

I did everything the recipe called for but don't have morels down here so swapped them with fresh white caps plus 1/2 cup of bell pepper. Came out great. Baby Ray's topped it off. I made the mistake of just squirting a line pattern across the top of the meat. Next time I will spread a nice coat across the top.

Amazing recipe!  Venison, bacon, cheese, mushrooms and barbeque sauce...how could it not be wonderful!
I didn't have morel mushrooms, so I used baby bellas.  I also used "butcher's cut" thick bacon on top.  So very yummy...I guess my hubby will have to hunt more so I can make it again!  (Although I'm willing to try it with beef as Aacker2005 suggested.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe and didn't change a thing about it.  Having 3 deer hunters in the family gives me a lot of venison to be creative with.  This is hands down one of their favorites.  I like using straight venison (vs mixing it with pork) and wrapping the loaf with 7 or 8 bacon strips to help hold it together, then bake it on a broiler pan to catch all the drippings and keep even more of the fat away from the meat.  Always have a warm bottle of barbecue sauce on the table for those who want some on every bite!

So good!  I didnâ€™t have cheese slices so I used shredded cheese and I also only had thick cut bacon so I turned on the broiler for the last 4 minutes and cooked about 6 inches from the broiler.  I will definitely make this again.

There was one problem with this recipe.  It doesn't make enough as far as my family is concerned.  lol  Everyone gobbled it right up.  Next time we are doubling the batch.  We are keeping this recipe for our regular rotation ones.  Thank you for sharing it.  We also didn't use venison, though I would love to try it with that.  We use a combination of ground pork and ground beef.

I've made this maybe a dozen times, always to rave reviews. The only thing I change is to experiment with different meats. The current fave is half ground elk and half ground wild boar, but all have been exceptional.

We made this tonight with some grass-fed ground beef. I wasn't a fan of the flavor of the ground beef by itself, so we were looking for a recipe with lots of added flavor. This was great! Two pounds of beef makes for a massive meatloaf. We had a BBQ sauce from a local place that is tomato-based, so using that sauce makes this recipe pretty similar in flavor to a traditional meatloaf. I think Sweet Baby Rays would be better (that's what I use on my BBQ cheeseburgers). Our oven isn't the best, so we had to cook it much longer than called for. Still, it turned out flavorful and awesome tasting.

This was amazing, tender and juicy! I added a third egg, used white mushrooms instead of morel, added kosher salt and garlic powder and switch ketchup for hot sauce. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was delicious. I did not make any changes to it. My husband is an avid hunter and we've been eating venison for years - he said this was one of his favorite recipes ever.. that's a pretty big compliment! The whole family loved it.

Delicious! I followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing! Definitely using my venison burger for this again! I did use a 9x13 because I didn't have a 11x7  but it worked well.

This meatloaf was great. It also made a wonderful sandwich the next day.
