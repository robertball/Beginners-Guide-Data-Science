These were very good, but I definitely would not call them scones. At breakfast this morning we dubbed them "Pear Puddles" :) because the do spread out a good bit and that's what they look like.  I used 4 pears (didn't bother to measure, just needed to get rid of them) and because of the reviews I added a little more flavoring. I used cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and some finely grated orange peel just because I had it. They were very tasty! We ate them with a little butter, and they were sweet enough (but not too sweet) that they didn't need anything else. Will make again :) Thank you

I didn't measure the pears just used the last 3 that were in my fruit bowl. I can't get half and half in the UK so I usually use light cream. I wasn't paying attention when I took the container out of the fridge and had already mixed it in to the dough, when I realised I'd used plain yogurt instead. I went with it anyway and they still turned out well. Absolutely delicious still warm and covered in honey. Many Thanks for something a little bit different.

I used whole wheat flour instead of ap flour, 3 T honey instead of brown sugar, oil instead of butter, and soy milk in place of half and half.  Maybe I should not review this with all my changes, but this definitely was worth the try with fresh pears!  Yum!

This are excellent. Nice, soft, thick dough. I added 1/2 tsp ginger to the batter and 1 pear=1 cup so for those who said batter was too thin and they spread like puddles, pay attention to the recipe. 4 pears??

The batter for these are more like a dumpling, a bit wetter than a real scone batter. I didn't have half and half so I substituted buttermilk for the liquid. We enjoyed these for our afternoon  "coffee break'. I have added this to my keeper list as they are quick and easy but a nice change from regular scones.'

Great recipe!  I made this because I have a pear tree and needed to use up some pears.  One change: I substituted milk for the half-and-half, and only added a little at a time until the batter was just barely moist (it was probably closer to 1/3 cup than 1/2 cup).  This change made the batter just right, not too wet.  Delicious!

I'm going to have to disagree on this one. The dough was far too wet and the scones spread too much. The pear flavor was barely noticeable. They tasted OK to me, but not much like a scone at all. I'll stick with my traditional recipe and experiment with adding pears.

These scones were very good. Just enough sweetness and the pears are flavorful. I peeled and chopped 3 pears to yield the 1 cup called for in the recipe.

These were great,  I'll make them again!  Just the right amount of cinnamon.  And the chopped pears gave them substance.

Used 1 home-grown bartlet pear and plain yogurt instead of cream-dough was just like scone dough should be. Served them with my pear and ginger marmalade and they were delish!

They don't really look like proper scones, by proper I suppopse I mean store bought, but they sure taste good & the look of them just adds to their homemade charm.

great recipe for a light and healthy scone. The only change I made was substitute all-purpose flour with whole sprouted wheat flour. It was divine! Thank you so much for sharing this simple and delicious scone recipe.

I also would not call these scones.  They are too light and soft to be scones.  Mine did spread a lot probably because my pears were very moist.  The flavor is sublime.  Very delicate spicing let the pear flavor shine.  I will certainly make them again, at least until I use up all these very ripe pears.  I'm going to try a little more flour in the next batch.

These turned out great!  Even the kids had seconds.  I substituted sour cream for the half and half and found the consistency before and after baking to be perfect.  Yum!  I'll be making these again.

Perfect!  I followed the directions exactly except I used whole wheat flour.  I topped half of them with honey and half with powered sugar icing. I'm sure I will be making them again.

Good, not to sweet. We really enjoyed them, thanks.I did use vanilla yogurt instead of cream. Use a pastry blender to mix the butter, Flour & sugar. Your hands will warm it to much & make it thinner.I let them cool completely before putting the left over ones in a tin, they do get soft overnight. I toasted them before serving.

Slightly more muffin-like in texture than true scones, but moist, delicious, and very pear-tasting.  Here were my changes:  1/2 cup plain yogurt instead of half and half 2 C. chopped pear  I added half the pear with the yogurt so it would mash down and add liquid.  The other half was very large chunks I stirred in at the end.  I baked them for 20 minutes in one large, flat circle scored into wedges on a greased cookie sheet instead of making individual scones.

Absolutely delicious.  I made it with freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  I used my trusty little Pampered Chef egg slicer to dice the pears (which I didn't bother peeling).  I used a large cookie scoop to dip the dough, and it made 15 smallish scones, which were perfect size for my 3 1/2 year old.  Big hit at breakfast this morning.

Tris' "Pear Puddles" happened because she used too many pears. I made four recipes and used the required fruit and they turned out with a nice texture. I used her idea of cardamon and orange peel. My co-workers loved them. One lady said, "Your cookies are delicious." Thank you, I will  definitely use this recipe next season when our trees are full of pears, again.

I added a little more brown sugar and cinnamon to the top before baking. I also substituted apples in place of the pears and added caramel chips for a soft gooey scone.

These are great, although definitely more cookie like than actual scones. They're not overly sweet, but I think that's the point for a breakfast item.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy to make and just delicious.  My pears were quite ripe and therefore full of flavour. I measured my cut pears (unpeeled) and the suggested amount was perfect for this recipe.  I only had whole wheat flour so I used that and I needed my cream for my coffee so I put in plain yogurt and a splash of good vanilla instead.  I will definitely be making this again, it was even easier then a quick batch of muffins and healthy enough that I didn't mind the kids sneaking a couple of extras off the counter.  Thanks for the delicious, easy recipe!!

Quite good. Baking powder blends well with no shocks. A very light and fluffy treat to have with tea that adds a flare of pear every once and awhile. 

(a bit of nutmeg works well in it as well.)

I made these to use the pears in my fruit bowl, they did spread out like other reviewers said, which I was afraid would happen as the batter was thinner than a typical scone batter. As the first ones spread, I decided to cook the rest of the batter in muffin cups and turned out much better. My 2 and 4 year old were eating the batter out of the bowl as they taste great, just not scones. Perhaps adding extra flour and some baking soda would result in a better scone.

I agree with some other reviewers that these aren't traditional scones, but they're quick and delicious. The only change I made was to use whole milk instead of cream.

Thank you for the recipe- wonderful way to use up very ripe pears I had. These are however NOT scones- texture is completely different and too moist. They are nice little breadlets with some hint of sweetness, something like madelines. Their selling point is they are very very light ( I had 3 in one sitting!!). Flavor is ok- hardly any pear flavor but that's not the recipes fault- thats just how pears are :)

Turned out perfect! I doubled the recipe. The person who said the scones were “puddles” used way to many pears. 1 cup of pear is about 1 1/2 large pears. I would add raisins or cranberries next time. This is a no sugar recipe - loved it!

Very good!  Mine did not spread much.  I used one pear and added 1/2 t. powdered ginger.  Instead of dropping large spoons of dough, I packed into 1/3 cup measuring cup.  That prevented spreading too thin.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

These turned out quite heavy and a bit too moist for me; even little wet. It could be that I added too much pears, but I didn't even finish cooking the dough once I tasted the first batch.

Made exactly per recipe and they were scrumptious.  One Bosc pear equaled slightly more than a cup.  I snacked on the extra.  The texture is fine like a muffin but the flavor was wonderful.  I will make these again.

Excellent recipe and a good way to use up the odd pear! Since so many people mentioned the batter being too wet, I reduced the milk to 1/3 c and that worked just fine (I also used unsweetened almond milk since I was out of regular milk). The batter was the consistency of drop biscuit dough and the scones did not spread. I used most of one pear. Not too sweet, perfect with hot tea on a cold day.

These were great!  Looked at the comments and made sure to use just the one cup of pears as recommended.  I had Asian Pears and they were perfect in this.  I threw dried cranberries in some - and added a little icing (powdered sugar and lemon juice) to those - very popular with the kids!   Consistency was perfect - would definitely make again!

The scones were very good. I added a little bit more honey on top of the 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and turned out perfectly sweet end. I also put a tiny amount of brown sugar on top of them when they were fresh out of the oven. Very, very, good moist, and will be making them again!

These may be my favourite scones. I was looking for recipes to use up a basket of pears I had bought and came across this one. Other than using ground ginger instead of cinnamon I didn't change a thing. The texture of the dough was very much like a traditional scone, so I wasn't able to use the "drop by spoonfuls" instructions. Instead, I patted out the dough into a circle and cut it into 8 triangles. They came out flaky and tender, with a delicate flavour. Will definitely bake again!

I think this recipe is excellent.  I followed the recipe as written except I added ginger as one reviewer did.  They're very good. Four pears is more than three cups...of course it's runny.  Follow the recipe and they'll come out great.  If you then want to play with the recipe, go for it but you at least have a starting point.

The recipe was very easy, which was nice.  I chose it because I had two pears that were getting overripe (really only needed 1 for the recipe).    I ended up adding a glaze to make it taste better - it was a little bland on its own.  My kids loved it after I added the glaze to make it sweeter.  I will add ginger to the batter next time, as one reviewer suggested.  and maybe some walnuts?

Yummy!  Mine came out more like a muffin than a scone, but I love them!  I used my own canned pears, which probably accounts for the extra moisture.  Even my British friends approved!

I found the texture to be more like drop biscuits than scones. I would have liked more spices and a little more sweetness to these; except for the bites of pear, I thought they were bland. I probably won't make these again, but thank you for the inspiration!

I really enjoy these scones and have made them multiple times, but like many, I have made my own variations. You certainly need more dry ingredients, so I suggest playing with the consistency until the batter looks scone-like. Either way, these do have a "muffin-y" texture when baked. 
When I'm feeling lazy, I substitute the dry ingredients (minus brown sugar) for Bisquik - so easy. I also use additional spices or substitute the pears for applesauce according to my whim on a particular day. Recently, I substituted 1/2 of the flour for whey protein to give some nutritional value to the recipe - totally worked - my son ate them right up!

After reading the reviews, I made this recipe with the following modifications:  1 c. whole wheat flour and 3/4 all purpose flour, increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  Added 1 c. oats (wanted to be able to form into wheel and slice), 1/2 c. toasted walnuts (will try pecans next time).  I only used one pear, but I would probably use 2 next time.  Still turned out very moist and I would definitely make them again.
