The whole family enjoyed this. Never would have thought to put this on corn but it works well. I made as written. I have never cooked with hoisin or oyster sauce before this. I thought hoisin tasted a lot like molasses. A quick internet search showed that it is most often made with a molasses base. Many of the other ingredients that make up hoisin are already included in this recipe. Same for the oyster sauce. I really think you could leave out either the hoisin or oyster sauce and still be fine, or leave out the bottles sauces and sub molasses and other pantry ingredients to get the same result. I mention this only because now I have two full bottles of sauce I will never use. There are several recipes for making small batches of both sauces on the net. Obviously, this is more time consuming then just buying a bottle, but it will save you some money and cut back on waste if you aren't going to use the bottled sauces for other meals. Regardless of how you end up throwing this together, it will be well worth it. Kudos to the writer of this recipe for thinking outside the box.

Normally I hate it when people give 5 stars if they changed things, but the basic recipe was great. Since I ran out of red wine vinegar, I used balsamic vinegar and I did not have hoisin sauce so just left that out. I also did 4 minutes on each side. This was fantastic. It did not overpower the sweetness of the corn, it just enhanced the flavor. I had guests who loved it. I will definitely repeat this over and over again.
