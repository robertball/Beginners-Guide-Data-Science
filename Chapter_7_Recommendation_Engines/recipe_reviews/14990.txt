i didnt have the leek or parsnip so i just used a carrot, celery, potato and the tomatoes. i also used chicken broth instead of veggie and marsala wine instead of red. great flavor. i actually prefer my lentil soup really thick! that way i can scoop it up with crackers! oh and add hot sauce on top.. MMM!!

It was very good and plentiful. I certainly ended up with more than 2-3 servings. Also, the lentils absorbed a lot of the liquid, making it more of a stew than a soup. Next time, I will use only 1/2 cup of lentils to see if that will make it more like soup. All in all, a good, cheap and hearty recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!!  Very hearty and filling.  I doubled the recipe and ate leftovers all week because that's all I craved.  It was very good.

Behold a miracle! My children ate vegetables without even a murmur of a fuss or whine. In fact, they devoured it.  I used a Merlot for the wine (a bit more then called for too) and I used fresh tomatoes that I diced myself. Thank you for this very yummy recipe!

I left out the green onions, leek, & potato & substituted crushed tomatoes as I prefer a smoother tomato base.  Next time, I'm going to add adding can of vegetable broth or some water as the soup gets pretty thick.  You also may want to add salt & pepper, as desired, at the table.

Very tasty! The only change I made was to increase everything by about 1/2, and that way it made 8 cups of soup or 6 good servings. I'd say the original recipe would make closer to 4 servings.  You could add another can of stewed, crushed, or diced tomatoes, and maybe a regular onion instead of or in addition to the green onions if you prefer, but definitely very good as written.

This soup was a big hit!  Didn't have the leeks, potatoes or vegetable broth.  Substituted with chicken broth and added chopped canadian bacon.  Yum! Yum!

This soup is fantastic.  It is as hearty as a beef stew, but veggie-friendly!  I doubled the broth, otherwise it would be too thick.

It's a good recipe, but if you are vegetarian be aware that Worcesteshire has anchovies in it.  Tamarind is what gives Worcesteshire its "oomph," so use a tiny bit of tamarind and vinegar to get a hint of that flavor.

Good soup Judith. We're not vegetarians so I used a hamhock for flavor. I skipped the potato and needed to add a lot more liquid as it cooked. A little bit of finely sliced red onion for garnish made for a nice presentation. Thanks!

I love Lentil soup!  This was a bit lacking in flavor for me, so I threw in some Curry, Cardamon pods and cayenne pepper.  I also used Rotel tomatoes instead of just generic diced tomatoes which added a nice bit of flair.  No need to be stingy on the veggies-the more the merrier :-)  This was my first attempt at lentil soup and found this recipe more like good suggestions rather than instructions.  But that is the fun of cooking isn't it? :-)  Lentil stew will be a staple dinner in my house.

I enjoy a thick soup and found this nice and hearty.  I added an extra carrot and parsnip since I really like veggies, and an extra cup of water to account so it didn't thicken too much.

Used a turnip instead of parsnips ~ store out of parsnips. Also did not use any wine. And it was GREAT!!!

This is a very tasty soup. Like others, I adapted a little based on what I had, but I tried to keep generally the same volume of veggies altogether. Because of one reviewer's observation that it turned out more like a stew, I doubled the broth. It turned out perfectly with that ratio. Even without meat, this really hits the spot on a cold winter day.

Winner winner, (not) chicken dinner. Ok, I cheated and put chicken sausage in and used chicken broth. Didn't have some things, had others. Used fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce, a bit heavy on the sauce and a bit lighter on the broth. I used less liquid so it was not so soup-like, which is what I wanted. I'm ready to dig in but had to share a rating after my initial tasting.

This soup is very good and hearty. I accidentally used a 28oz can of tomatoes, but it was perfect. I also added a can of corn. I love that this recipe does not have any meat, and it's so easy!

I didn't have parsnip so was omitted. I doubled the recipe and had plenty leftovers. Prior to serving I added grated Parmesan. We always had it with parm as kids. I love it that way. Good recipe, I will make this again for sure! Thanks Judith!
