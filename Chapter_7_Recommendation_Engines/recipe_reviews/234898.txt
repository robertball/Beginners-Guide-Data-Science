I made these in the KA, kneaded for about 10 minutes, let the dough rise for about an hour, punched down and deflated the dough.  From that point, I followed the rest of the recipe.  The texture is light, the rolls are tender, they have just a hint of sweetness, and they cooked perfectly at 15 minutes.  Great dinner rolls, but will make good slider buns or a bun for a breakfast sausage patty.  I might try an egg wash the next time rather than brushing them with butter.  Thanks, Beth, this is a 5-star recipe, we loved it!

Wow, wow, wow! We loved these! I got rid of my bread maker so I used my KA. I proofed my yeast by combining the water sugar and yeast and let it sit for maybe 15 minutes. I mixed in the butter, egg, salt and 1/2 of the flour with a wooden spoon and then mixed everything else up on my KA using the dough hook. I had it on I think 2 or 3 for about 3 minutes. I turned it out in an oiled bowl and placed it in my plate warmer for an hour on low. I punched the dough down and followed the rest of the directions from there. I made mine bigger and had only 12 rolls. These would make phenomenal hamburger buns! They were delicious with our stew, but I can't wait to make burgers with these.

I wanted to add to my review. I use all purpose flour, and it comes out great no matter what I make with it. I'm photo of the rolls and a loaf of bread I made with this recipe. Amazing results, soft bread slices real nice!! Thanks again for this incredible recipe :)

FINALLY!!  I have been looking for a soft, fluffy dinner roll recipe and after trying myriad different ones, this is the one!!  I don't have a bread machine so took other review ideas.  I put sugar, 110 degree milk (instead of water as some reviews said) and yeast in my KA mixing bowl.  Mix well and let sit 10 mins.  Added butter, egg, salt and 1/2 of flour and mixed with wooden spoon then added remaining flour and mixed with dough hook for 5 mins. on speed 3.  Put dough ball in oiled bowl and proofed in my oven on proof setting for 1 hour. (100 degrees F.)  Took out risen dough and punched down and cut into even sections.  You can make them whatever size you'd like.  Roll into balls and put into greased baking pan. Brush w/melted butter and cover with saran wrap and proof another 30 mins.  Bake and enjoy!! The ONLY thing I would change other than using milk instead of water is I would add a little more salt but that's personal preference.  I used 3 cups of flour and it was perfect.  Try them!! They are so easy and DELICIOUS!!!  Will not try another recipe now.

Wow, I make bread on a regular basis, but these dinner rolls blew me away because of their light and delicate texture. I made them on the dough cycle in my bread maker, dissolving the yeast and sugar in the water before I added the egg, flour, and salt. The dough was almost too soft to make the filled chicken pockets that I used it for, but I think it was worth the extra hassle of working with a loose dough to get the super light texture. That said, I don’t think two to three tablespoons of extra flour would hurt. I fluffed my flour before measuring, so it might have been on the scanty side for bread. I’m going for cinnamon rolls with this next.

Made these last night.  Used the breadmaker dough setting.  The dough was very wet and sticky, had to add a lot more bread flour to keep from sticking to the sides.  Once I punched it down and removed from the pan it was still very sticky and hard to handle and I had a tough time separating into the pieces.  All that being said, the rolls are great, everyone here loved them and I will be making them again.  If not for the stickiness issue (and that was probably my fault some way), they are a 5 for sure because of the ease in making them and the great texture and taste.  *****Updated**** made them again and they are perfect - figured it was user error last time.  We are in love with the flavor and texture.  My rating is a definite 5+++

Oh my my! These rolls are amazing..... I make them almost every Sunday with dinner. My kids would eat them everyday. To change things up I sometimes add a packet of dry Italian dressing mix. And other time I make a mixture of butter honey and garlic powder and brush overtop after they are done baking. What a wonderful recipe??

I made these exactly as the recipe is written for Thanksgiving. They turned out really well.  I didn't know exactly how to shape rolls, so I divided the recipe into 16 fairly rough balls (using quite a bit of flour as it is pretty sticky) and cut a 1" "x" in the tops with a pair of scissors then let them rise in the 9x13 pan.  After baking, they look like they came from a bakery, with great taste and texture.  This recipe is a keeper.

These are amazing.  My secret, is  I heat my oven to it's lowest temperature, and then turn it off, and put the rolls in with a small (metal) cup of water so they don't dry out for the final rise, and these rolls turned out  huge and so fluffy!

Seriously easy and fast!  They came out perfectly.  :)  I never use my bread machine because it has never turned out a single decent loaf of bread.  I wanted some rolls in a hurry and it wasn't going to be life or death if the recipe didn't work. I used Bronze Chief High Gluten Chemical Free flour just to see what would happen and the result was perfect!  Definitely a go-to recipe.

Amazing. These were gone within minutes! I used my KA mixer with dough hook for 10 min. and put into a greased bowl, covered with damp towel, set in fridge for about an hour.  I punched down the dough, made 15 balls, put into greased 9x13, brushed with melted butter and let rise. Baked for 15 min. and they came out perfect. SO EASY. I will be making several batches of these for Thanksgiving. 
Note: I did add an extra heaping tablespoon of flour during the kneading.

These rolls are classic, melt in your mouth dinner rolls. Super soft, super fluffy. I made the dough by hand and it came out perfectly. No bread machine necessary. I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, but tweeked the recipe a bit. First, I reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe by half. I personally don't like sweeter rolls and they still turned out sweet enough with only using half of the sugar called for. Second, I added lowfat milk along with the water. I proofed the yeast in a bowl with the warmed milk, water, and sugar. These rolls are heavenly, and they made my house smell amazing! ;) the only change I will make for my next batch is to add a bit more salt than the recipe calls for. This is my new go-to recipe for crowd pleasing dinner rolls! Thank you!

I used a KA also.  Limited space,  mixer wins!  Started with a sponge with the yeast, 3T sugar, water, and 1/4 c bread flour.  After 15 mins, added remaining ingredients, less sugar.  Kneaded 10 mins, 1 hour rise.  Shaped half the dough, froze remaining half .   Placed 9 rolls in 8x8 pan.  2nd rise about 30 mins then egg wash, baked 15 mins.  Perfect!

Made these this morning as a test just to see if they would turn out for a big family dinner we are hosting on the weekend.  They turned out perfect! I can't believe I made them! If I can make them, anybody can. I used all-purpose flour and bread machine yeast as that's what I had.

Hi, this is a very simple recipe and today is the second time making it.  I use my KitchenAid to mix the dough and wait for it to rise.  
The first time I made them it was for a family dinner and rave reviews were received from everyone.  I have a recipe which was passed to me from my Step-father which I used to make however these are less sweet and very tender.  If you eat one more than likely you will be going back for a second one.  I wonder if they would be as nice if they were made into buns?

These are GREAT, we rate these a 10!  This is the first time I have made rolls at home and I will be making them again.   We had always bought premade frozen rolls, but not after finding this recipe.  It is very simple to make and it uses ingredients already on hand.

This recipe is awesome. My whole family loved these rolls. They were great for little sandwiches the next day too. The first time I used all bread flour. The next time I used a mix of bread flour and white whole wheat flour. Great both ways!

These are great! Fourth time I've made them and they are awesome every time. I don't use bread machine. I use a stand mixer. Put warm water and yeast in to proof, add the rest of ingredients except flour. Mix on low, add one cup flour and mix on medium for a minute, then gradually add rest of flour but no more than 3 1/4 cups or they will be dense and not light. If dough is too sticky to work with just dust the surface you are working on with a bit of flour before shaping balls.

I tried this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving.  Super, super easy; delicious!! Soft on inside & wonderfully crispy on the outside.
Due to recent dietary changes (I'm allergic to dairy & egg yolks) I amended it as follows:
Used Earth Balance buttery spread in lieu of the butter & 1/2 cup egg whites (4 egg whites) in lieu of the eggs.  I had to bake about 20 minutes.  I also used all-purpose flour; they turned out beautiful & delicious.  YUMMMMMMYYYY!!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is my new go-to recipe for rolls, it's been a big hit with all three kids, and two rounds of company. It tastes exactly like the rolls we would usually buy in the store bakery, and being a bread maker recipe, it's so easy and so simple. The only change I made was to sub a 1/4 cup honey for the sugar, as I do with most baking.

The bread is amazing but if you add 1 tbsp of dried onion, 1/2 cup of Parmesan and 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic the result is even better. Worth trying

I have wanted to make my own dinner rolls for a long time.  This was delicious!  And the best part is they were still soft when warmed up a day or two after!  Thank you!

Although easy to make, they seemed day old right out of the oven. They weren't the 'soft' rolls I was looking for or expected from such a highly rated recipe.

Easy, forgiving, low fat and no dairy.  No special ingredients to search for in the cupboard .  The kids loved them so much they took the leftover rolls for lunch the next day.

I loved the softness of these rolls but I found them to be too sweet. I may have messed up on the sugar quantity somehow but I don't know for sure as I was making pies etc at the same time. I will definitely make them again but cut back on the sugar. As a Canadian I find that American breads are on the sweet side compared to our brands so that might have something to do with it. Others at dinner liked them but just as many agreed that they were too sweet.

12/28/2014 Delicious!
Update: I made these today...no bread machine. I followed the recipe exactly as is. I used the Mixer with bread attachment. I proofed the yeast in warm water for 10 minutes. I added all the ingredients together. Mixed until it formed a ball. I kneaded for a few minutes. I cut them in 23 little rolls 1.30 ounces each. I oiled a 9x13 pan, brushed them with the butter and let them rise for 1 hour. I put a few poppy seeds and sesame seeds on some. After the hour, I made an x on top of each little roll. I baked at 350. These are delicious!

These lived up to their name. I made them Saturday afternoon to take to Sunday dinner. They were still soft, and everyone loved them. 

I don't have a bread machine or a Kitchen Aid, so I mixed the dough, kneaded it until it was elastic and all the flour was mixed in, and let it rise until doubled. Then I followed the recipe. 

I made 24 per pan instead of 15, though I will likely stick with 15 next time as the 24 were kind of small. I gave this recipe 4 stars because the rolls just did not look good. I tried really hard to have smooth tops, but nothing worked. Maybe I kneaded it too long?

Also, I forgot the egg in one batch and that dough turned out just a little less elastic than the batch with the egg. Either way, it was a good recipe that I will make again.

After making buns by hand, this bread machine recipe is a life saver!  The texture is soft with a sweet hint in the dough.  I normally have to let the buns rise in the oven with light on for about an hour to give the second rise time.  I have to say, after making them many, many times, they've never turned out poorly.  Excellent recipe, thank you!

I usually go to the "Sweet Dinner Roll" recipe here on allrecipes.  I thought I would go outside the box and try this one.  Since there is no dairy and I would save milk. 

AMAZING, perfect rolls.  Very similar to Sweet Dinner Rolls from allrecipes.  I will make again and again.  I didn't use a bread machine, just a bosch to mix/knead the dough. 
Thank you!!

These were easy and delicious.  I made dinner rolls for Thanksgiving and also used the dough to make sticky buns and orange honey buns.  It worked perfectly every time--my new favorite dough for all things roll related!

I did triple the batch, added a bit more salt and I mixed all dry ingredients together, melted the butter until soft and put it in the warm water along with the eggs. Wet into dry and hand kneaded until the dough was nice and smooth.. I had to add a tiny bit of water. I preheated my oven on lowest setting with a pan of hot water in it. Then I let it rise until double, took out deflated made 36 buns 3 pans of 12. rose them again until they all filled the pans nicely. Baked in convection oven at 400 for 12 minutes.
Then while hot I brushed them with butter. We had pulled pork in them and the first 12 are gone - rest goes for lunches. They are fabulous!

Best roll recipe I have ever tried. Fool-proof and delicious. You can also cut your proofing time in half by allowing your buns to rise in an oven that was warmed to 125 and shut off. (Yes, I'm impatient!) Thank you for this recipe. I'll never need another one!

I made a double batch for Easter Dinner.  The family loved them. I did pat them out and cut them like a biscuit before place in the pan to rise after a 1st rising of the dough. I then let them double in size before baking. My husband was impressed with how soft they were and not dense. The leftovers made great turkey sliders.

The recipe calls for the yeast to be added in the mix but if you are using a mixer you aren't supposed to do that. You are supposed to dissolve the yeast into a hot liquid. There should be different variations of this recipe.

I make these for every family dinner; Easter, Christmas and so on.  I always make a double batch because my mother in law walks away with some to take home  they are simply perfect.  I measure everything into my KA mixer and give it a mix with the hook attachment - about five minutes  and follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  the only difference is I find the bottoms brown too quickly so I reduced the banking temp by fifteen degrees and they are perfect every time . Thanks for such an awesome recipe!  Now my whole family thinks I'm a talented baker !

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! Excellent! Easy to make, easy to eat! It'll be hard to keep these around. These were some of the most moist buns I've ever made, they came out exactly as I expected and then some.

I'm a purist so I wouldn't consider this a recipe  because it calls for the use of a bread machine. It is more a list of ingredients to throw into the machine and hope that the bread machine will know what to do with it. 

Doing the seven  bread steps is much more fulfilling. However using the ingredients and working by hand everything turned out fine… The rolls were delicious.

Finally! I finally found the roll recipe that I have been looking for!  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and proofed the yeast in the sugar water for about 10 minutes then mixed the ingredients with the dough hook on the KA for about 2 minutes (on speed 2). I turned the dough into an oiled bowl and covered with damp cloth and placed in oven with the light on. I let it rise about 1 hour then punched it down. I made 9 rolls in an 8x8 greased pan and put the rest in a loaf plan. I covered with plastic wrap for about 1/2 an hour. I brushed them with the melted butter before baking. They turned out exactly as I wanted!! I am thrilled, it has been a long journey of trial and error to get here! Hope this was helpful! Happy cooking!

Love this recipe. I have made it several times. The first time I did it for dinner rolls. I realized that it would make great burger and hot dog buns. It did.
I don't have a breadmaker. I make all my bread with my KA. I knead the dough for 9-10 minutes. Then place it in a greased bowl turning the dough ball to coat. Once it doubles I punch it down and shape it into buns, or balls. I follow the instructions from this point.
The only changes I have made are adding an extra teaspoon of yeast. For some reason where I live the normal leavening is never enough. Also, I like a little more salt, so I add a tablespoon instead of teaspoon.
This is a great recipe as is for most. I am going to use it to make bread. I think it will come out great.

My first time making “bread” and they turned out perfect! They raised well and were soft and fluffy. My son loved them and my husband said it would be dangerous if I made them all the time. I used a little less sugar as per other reviews but other than that followed Ingredients as written. I don’t have a bread machine, so I used my mixer and hands. YUM! Will make again.

I thought the 9x13 pan was a bit too big so the rolls spread out a bit.  I made these for a buffet (ham sliders) and this is being added to my permanent repertoire.  At the last minute I decided to add 1/4 cup of powdered milk and that might not be necessary for the egg and butter.   I expect these would make excellent hamburger buns as well and in the future add some flavors like dried onion and herbs.  I don’t have a bread machine so just made in the traditional manner.

Followed the directions for the dough cycle on my bread machine,  and they turned out beautifully. There's just enough sugar to feed the yeast without making the bread taste sweet. My husband couldn't get enough at dinner tonight!

This roll recipe is the absolute best. Light as air, these fluffy little pillows of goodness are a real treat. Most times the rolls at a holiday meal are an after though but not these. I watched them go around the table and disappear before the rest of the food was passed. They truly deserve 5 stars. The only adjustment was I let them rise under a towel before brushing with butter and finishing the rise with plastic wra over top so they stayed separated.

So easy!  Most “easy” roll recipes recipes don’t work out for me - usually under proofed hard lumps of dough..l but not these.   They turned out perfectly!

I don't have a bread maker, so I just put it in my mixer until it formed a sticky dough ball. Then I kneaded it until I liked the texture. After that I followed the recipe and  boy were they yummy! The best easy dinner rolls I've had in a while.

I've been looking for a nice soft bread recipe.  This is it.  I didn't use a bread machine but mixed it up in my stand mixer with the dough hook.  I used very warm water and quick rise yeast that I sprinkled on top of the flour.   After kneading I let the dough rest for 10 minutes then shaped it into balls.  I let it rise for about an hour then baked.  I think next time I will try adding some old cheddar.  A keeper. Thanks for posting.  ??

Wish there was a option to make it from scratch instead of in s bread machine. Overall good. Dough came out a little weird at first but usually does when changing a bread machine recipe to a scratch recipe. Kneading made the dough perfect.

I make this recipe often, at least once or twice a week to go with dinner.  It is a simple recipe, and a huge hit.  People in my house graze on the rolls throughout the day until they are completely gone.
They also make excellent slider buns, and if you portion the dough out into 6 hoagie-shaped rolls, they make amazing hoagie buns.  Sometimes, I'll portion out half the recipe into dinner rolls and place them in a pie-pan to bake, and shape the remaining half into 3 hoagie buns so I can have them with sandwiches the next day.

Great recipe! I use my KitchenAid stand mixer and the dough turns out perfect every time. Only change I made is brushing on some more butter after the buns come out of the oven, keeps the crust extra soft.

These are my go to dinner rolls. I always use my bread machine for the first mix and rise and then follow instructions for the shaping and second rise. They always turn out fantastic with either bread flour or all purpose and everyone loves them.

My favorite roll recipe that  I make for family and friends a couple times a week. I have made it using a bread machine to make the dough and it works out great. I have also made them without the bread machine I just mix the dry ingredients and I add a little bit of this sugar into the warm water and used to prove it and then add everything together and mix it. It comes out great either way.

Love this recipe! The dough is wonderful!  The only thing I added was 1/4 cup of Special Dry Milk from King Arthur Flour!  The addition of the dry milk makes the rolls so much better!  Try it!

Followed this exactly.  Made with KA flour in my Zo Bread Machine.  These rolls were very, very light....and we all loved them.  Made 15 rolls in a 9x13 pan.

Actually use this for a bread recipe. Mix sugar water, butter, eggs and yeast together. let sit for ten minutes until yeast froths and then continue on with the recipe. have many requests from the kids to make more. I double the recipe using 3 1/2 cups white and 3 cups whole wheat. Mix in 3 lb bread machine then split dough in to two bread pans and bake for 30 minutes at 350 in oven.

I divided the dough into 16 rolls because I was halving the dough. 1 TBlsp of melted Butter should be enough to brush over the rolls. Start there and add as needed. I followed the recipe otherwise. The rolls were fantastic! I want to try to use them as mini sandwich buns for a party but everyone loves them plain too.

Easy and delicious. We made 24 small rolls and they were gobbled up. We made the recipe exactly per the instructions and used the dough setting on the bread machine. Will make these again!

We loved these rolls! I don't really measure, but these rolls came out great and rose VERY well. They sat out for about two hours before cooking and baked in about 17 minutes. The ingredients are simple, the rolls are filling. It really makes a difference to brush with butter right when they come out of the oven. YUM!

Just what I was hoping they'd be. Love them. I'm going to make lil ham and cheese baked app sandwiches out of them. Light and fluffy. Will make them again. NEW INFO: I just made two batches of these, both were done in the bread machine dough cycle. First batch was perfectly wonderful a 5 star. Second batch was only a 3 star. Thinking back I believe I KNOW WHY. First batch came out of the bread machine and I did punch it down, went a bit further and kneaded it a bit then rolled them into balls best I could and placed into pan to rise again before baking. Second batch I skipped the second knead after the punch down. They came out tasting good but were not as light and airy as the first batch was. I'm a bit of a perfectionist I threw batch two out as they will be for company. I'm on batch number three which I will not forget to knead the second time.

I made the dough with my bread machine then rolled it out, cut it into 12 pieces and cut each piece into three smaller pieces.  I rolled the small pieces into balls and put three pieces into each cup of my muffin tin, brushed the tops with butter and baked them.  They were HUGE because the recipe is for 15 rolls and I made it fit into 12 muffin cups,  but they were a hit at the dinner table.  Very tasty and so easy because my bread machine did all the hard work!!!!!  I will definitely make these again!

These rolls were fantastic! Didn’t have a bread machine so followed another reviewers directions using a Kitchen Aid mixer. These were a snap to make for Thanksgiving dinner. These are also good if you make them ahead and refrigerate after rising the second time. Just allow dough to warm up before baking or adjust for longer baking time if baking cold dough. Mix fresh herbs or garlic with butter before brushing the dough for even more versatility. Thank you for posting!

I accidentally let the dough sit it the bread machine for a full rise, punched it down and divided it and let it have another rise (3 total). They were soft and so delicious!

Excellent rolls, made 24 in a sheet pan, light and fluffy, perfect for tomorrow’s Thanksgiving Dinner. Made them in my bread maker then took them out after mixing and resting. Baked for 14 min, I didn’t baste them with butter but they were still lovely! Thank you!

I made these today.  Not only was it easy, they were so delicious.  My husband said they were out of this world and tasted like they came right from a bakery.  Getting ready to make another batch to share with family.  Will be making bunches for holiday gifts with homemade jelly and fresh churned butter.  Thank you for sharing.

Easy to make, delicious taste, couldn't ask for more.

These were so easy and baked up like a dream.  Why buy store-bought buns/rolls with who knows what in the ingredient list.  Kept the flour organic and felt great about serving it.

Used one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of white.  They took closer to an hour to rise but they are wonderful.

These are so good!! I've made them several times now. The order I put the ingredients into my bread machine is water (I use bottled water-it makes a difference for me), egg (lightly beaten), butter, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Use the back of your tablespoon to make a well in the dry ingredients and put the yeast in the well. I don't change any of the ingredients. Thanks for a keeper recipe.

My daughter says that I am the official roll maker.
I didn't use a bread machine. I put the yeast and used honey instead of sugar, mixed them into the water, let it set for ten minutes. I then put all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid and kneaded  for ten minutes. 
Let it rise for 1hour, made the rolls, let it rise for 30 mins and baked per directions.

Made these according to the recipe.  Everyone in my family loved them, even the super picky one.  They bartered for the last roll. I topped them with a honey, sugar, butter and egg white wash before baking for a sweeter taste.  I will try with Asiago next.

Quick, Easy, and Delish! I made in my KA, with no problem, Did add more salt and sugar, (only to my liking). Will definitely make again. Would make excellent buns , if rolled out larger.  I won't roll into balls next time, I like the texture better by cutting dough, more like rectangle.

Not sure what I am doing wrong my rolls were tough. The flavor was GREAT. I sure there is something I am not getting. I will continue to try.

This recipe was an absolute hit!  I don't own a bread machine, so I followed the advice of another reviewer who used a stand mixer with a dough hook.  She advised to proof the yeast in warm water with the sugar for about 15 minutes in the bowl of the mixer.   Then add the butter, salt and egg and 2 cups of the flour and mix with a spoon. Add the balance of the flour (I ended up using 3 1/2 cups instead of the 3 1/4 cup and achieved the perfect consistency).  Place the dough in a greased bowl, gently spread melted butter over it, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 1 hour.  I followed the rest of the instructions as is.  I also used this recipe to make a loaf of bread and it came out great.  I've made this three times so far, the first time the results were not great, but I decided to give it another shot because of all the great reviews, and I'm glad I didn't give up.  The second time I used all purpose flour because that's all I had on hand, and it came out very nice.....but the third time I made sure I used bread flour, and OMG, next level softness, fluffiness and oh so good.   A definite keeper.  Thank you to the poster for sharing.

P.S. I was reading some of the less favourable reviews and had to point out the fact that sometimes when a recipe doesn't turn out like we expected, it may be our fault and not necessarily the recipe.  I'll always give a recipe a second or third try from now on to ensure I didn't mess up. I'm glad I did in this instance.

Adjusted serving size to twenty. It made 16 rolls in a 9x13 glass pan. Substuted milk for the water. They were a huge hit!

These came out perfectly! I followed the recipe as written with the only exception being the rise time.  Life decided to get in my way of baking so they had about an extra hour.  So SOFT and FLUFFY!! The hubby asked if I could make them bigger and use these for now on to use with his Steak Sandwiches.  I will need to make two batches for now on, my family of only 3 ate them all but were nice enough to leave me one. LOL Thank you for taking the time to submit this recipe it has already been added to my book.

Made these with prime rib and twice baked potatoes for a Christmas dinner.  They got rave reviews from my family.  Used the recipe and made with kitchenaid mix and rolled by hand.

I used this recipe because I couldn't find my recipe and I had to make them for a dinner I was going to. I read all the positive reviews and decided to go with this one. I was very disappointed. The rolls were not light and fluffy. They were kind of dry and not soft at all. I will go back to the recipe I got with my bread machine which I found the day after I made these.

You HAVE to let these rest before you put them in the oven, only way for them to rise and get that fluffiness. But next time I'm not using a 9x13 pan, that seemed too big. I'll use a pan just little smaller, as the 9x13 allowed the rolls to spread out too much and didn't rise UP as much as OUT.

I made these for Thanksgiving yesterday and I used whole milk in place of the water. The rolls were outstanding. I was a little leary that they might be too sweet but they were perfect! I baked them in muffin tins and the recipe made 19 large rolls. I plan on making these often. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

FANTASTIC! Light, fluffy, & buttery! These are easy to do in an aluminum pan that is disposable (which is great for potluck or holiday dinners), and my 8y/o daughter had a GREAT time helping me make them!!

These came out wonderfully.  Exactly the type of roll I was looking for.  The house smelt delicious while these were baking.  My only change was that I baked them for 17 minutes, as they were not quite done until then.  Loved them!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made these two ways, one with a tablespoon of  yeast in my bread machine dough cycle, the other with 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast (equivalent to one packet) in my Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook (I proofed the yeast in the warm water with the sugar for 15 min before adding other ingredients). In the mixer, I kneaded the dough about 5 min on 3.   The less-yeast/Kitchenaid batch turned out perfectly! The other batch was too yeasty tasting and the texture was less dense than desired. I much preferred the method with less yeast. I suspect that is what made the difference, not the machine.

If you use SAS instant yeast, there is no need for a second rise.  Mix the yeast with the flour and salt, mix and knead, make rolls, rise, bake.  Excellent  recipe!!  thank you!

Oh wow. These were AMAZING!  I am definitely using this recipe from now on. They were so light and fluffy and the most tasty ever! They were a huge hit in my family. 
Instead of making 15 rolls I made 24 smaller ones. I can't stop eating them. Yum!

I’ve been searching for a good yeast roll recipe and this is a great one!  You may or may not need all of the flour.  I always bake breads now by weighing flour instead of using a measuring cup.  I  weighed out the first three cups worth and put that in but then switch to the dough hook in my kitchenaid mixer and add the rest of the dough as needed.  You want the dough to stay slightly sticky.  You are not going for a clean round dough ball!  This made 16 perfectly sized rolls for me.  I like to weigh. y

Light and airy. If they aren't fluffy maybe your yeast is old.

Even with my subtitute s, they were good! I used vegan butter,  pure organic stevia instead of sugar and egg subtitute. Worked great! I used a bread machine. I'm going to make these again, next time using four to five packs of stevia.

Excellent recipe.  I have a question.  Would it still work if you shaped the buns in the pan and then put them in the fridge to rise and bake them later?..Will definitely make againl

Loved them!  I skipped the butter bath on top to avoid what someone said felt like "day old bread".  Didn't need it!
They were super soft and tasty!
Next day made for great egg sandwiches!

I made it today, I don't have bread flour so I used all purpose  flour,  I followed  everything  except I didn't wait 30 minutes to rise the dough, so it's not as soft as I expected. but I like it and my kids too . I will make it again  and let it rise to double next time.

It's great! I used my hand. No bread machine. I just used wholewheat flour instead and let it develop flavor first by creating a "sponge" (a mixture of flour, water, and yeast, which is allowed to ferment for at least 6 hours to develop mildly sour and nutty flavors). I also added raisins and used cinnamon sugar for richer taste. I spread butter lightly on top as soon as it left the oven. I didn't brush the butter beforehand.

Great little recipe for dinner rolls. I made homemade Honey Butter by melting some stick butter and adding in some fresh honey and basted the rolls right after they came out of the oven for Easter dinner. Everyone loved them!!!

I experience with this recipe to "veganized" it. Replaced butter w Earth Balance and used the vegan egg by Follow Your Heart. It worked wonderfully!!! The rolls rose nicely and the bread was super soft. My family didn't even notice the difference since none but me are vegan! I'm thinking maybe cinnamon buns next... hmmmm...

Melted the butter before adding it to the bread machine pan.  They turned out soft with a nice flavor.

Great rolls!  Slightly sweet, dense enough to make for good sandwich rolls the next day yet fluffy and light enough to not be a brick of bread.  I used the exact amounts listed here (I doubled the batch), but I didn't use a bread machine.  I mixed the warm water, sugar, and yeast together with a whisk and waited for the yeast to foam.  Then I added the butter and eggs and salt, also with a whisk.  Then I whisked in 2 of the cups of flour (I used bread flour).  Then I put the bowl on my Kitchenaid Artisan blender with a bread hook and added up to 6 1/2 cups of flour and mixed that slowly in.  Then I took the dough out and kneaded it on my counter with the last 1/2 cup of flour.  The dough will be slightly sticky, so don't expect it to be as easy to work as bread flour, but it's easily done if you keep your hands lightly floured.  And don't add extra flour or they will be too dense.  Rise once, shape into individual rolls, rise again, then bake.  Great results!

I had been making dinner rolls out of regular bread dough made in the bread machine and we were happy with them. Finally I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try and compare the two recipes. I gotta say this recipe was hands down better. Softer and stayed softer for days.

Rolls turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly and used the dough cycle on the bread machine. The only problem I found was that it was quite sticky getting the dough out of the machine, but I just floured my hands and added a bit more flour to the dough to allow me to actually handle it. I made 15 rolls like the recipe called for, but I think next time I'll make 30 out of the recipe instead. The rolls turned out great though!

In the past, I have not had a lot of luck with bread products.  However, things are starting to come together now.  I made these buns for thanksgiving using my kitchenaide  mixer and not a bread machine.  I am very happy with the outcome.

I have made these about six times now and my husband loves them.  I added honey and they came out so good..Also I am having trouble with the dough being very sticky and if you add flour it seems they are drier.. Any suggestions on handling the dough when its sticky would be great..  I also added Italian season to my butter last batch and boy was that good.

Excellent buns but  I cooked them at 350 and brushed with melted bitter after they were cooked. I used a bread maker to mix them.

After years of trying new recipes for dinner rolls, I stumbled across this one, and thought I would give it a try. I can honestly say these are the BEST rolls I have ever made or eaten!!! My picky husband couldn't stop eating them. He even put ham and cheese in them for a late night snack, and had them for breakfast this morning! I also went by the exact recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!

this has become my go-to recipe for great dinner bread. The only change I ever make is increasing the yeast a bit, depending on our wet weather here in the Northwest. Even the kids can make these rolls now. Thanks so much!

I've made these on five occasions so far and they are great every time. The last two times, I had to bake them a little longer-the middle roles were doughy still. With a little love and common sense, they turn out great every time. I've become the roll maker in my household when it used to be my wife's job. Not sure if I'm excited about that, but I do love these rolls.

These have a good flavor, but they are not attractive.  They appear to be more along the lines of a batter bread.  The batter was too soft to handle to make portions.  I used a cookie scoop to portion it out and they ran together quite a bit.  I didn't have a bread machine, so I don't know if that made a difference or not.  It shouldn't have.

These were fantastic! I used my KA and started it off with yeast, sugar and warm water. When frothy I added the rest of the ingredients. Before putting in the oven I used an egg wash. My family of four ate almost the entire 9x13 pan of rolls along with their steaks and vegetables.

Tried twice, both times with amazing results!! First time , no changes, but it was very sticky after dough cycle in bread maker. Second time I added 1/4 cup more flour. When I removed dough from bread maker, I thought  that maybe it was too much, but actually it turned out to be perfect. Did not need to add anymore flour to work with dough & separate into buns. This is my absolute favorite bun recipe!!

The only change I made is to add 4 Tbsp butter instead of 2 Tbsp.  I also use only King Arthur BREAD flour. The rolls come out perfect every time

I love these. I don't have a bread machine but they are easily a kneaded dough. I start out by making the dough with 3 cups of bread flour and then kneading in the other 1/4 cup as needed. I also do a second round of brushing melted butter over the top right after they come out of the oven. Soooo good!

These are great! The only thing different that I do is add an egg wash on too instead of butter. 1 egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of water mix it and brush over rolls right before you pop them in the oven! Makes a slightly toasted top like on baguette bread. Delicious.

I am the first to say I am not a baker but these are fail proof!  I stuffed with pepperoni and a small chunk of marble cheese after the first rise.  Baked as directed and then brushed with butter straight out of the oven.  Sprinkled with garlic salt and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

I made these today for our Thanksgiving dinner. I've never tried to make rolls before. Mine did not look at all like the picture. The dough was very sticky when it came out of the bread machine and was really difficult to make into 15 equal sizes. It also took a little longer to get the rolls to brown....but MY GOODNESS - they were SO DELICIOUS!!!

I am definitely NOT comfortable in the kitchen and have never made dinner rolls, or any rolls for that matter, before trying this out.  I made this exactly as it says and my husband and son, who are both great cooks, loved them!  In fact I had to make another batch to take to our family Thanksgiving dinner because they ate so many of the first batch. Thank you!

made them exactly as described !  They came out beautifully!  I have only started making yeast bread, used my bread maker for the dough, and baked in my oven.  So yummy!  I can see that if I make the balls larger, I could use these as sandwich rolls!!  Will make dough ahead, and have them in my freezer for any occasion!

I made these buns today and it's was super good. 8 made a few changes however. I used milk instead of water and I use 5cups of all purpose and a cup of wholewheat. I doubled the recipe and used 3 eggs instead of 2. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. I like that flavour.buns came out moist and very tasty.  Thanks

These are great! I also start the dough in my mixer with the dough hook attachment, then knead for 10 minutes before rising. Using bread flour was way better but came out good with AP too.  I've also left the egg out when I didn't have one.  Great with garlic butter.

Made these last night and they came out wonderful!!! Used my bread machine  to make the dough, didn't make any adjustments to the recipe. The rolls came out beautiful! Soft and light. They were a hit! My husband actually told me these are the rolls he wants me to make for Thanksgiving. This one is a keeper for us!

I tried these because I wanted to try making my own Hot Dog Rolls.  I mixed the dough as directed and shaped them into long rolls the width of my pan, placing them close together. The only problem I had with this is that I didn't have a pan that was quite narrow enough, so they came out a bit too long. I have since ordered a smaller pan.  The flavor was fantastic. They come out like "New England Rolls" which was what I was going for, so I sliced them from the top.  I buttered the sides and grilled them, and they were great! Next time I plan to make half of the dough into Hamburger Rolls.

Excellent!  Made these exactly according to the recipe and my family of five ate them all in one night.  I'm now making a second batch. They're that good!

These were excellent. I used a scant 1/4 cup of sugar and AP flour. I proofed the yeast in the water and sugar and then added the other ingredients and threw it in my KA w the dough hook. Mixed it up for 3 mins or so then let it rise. These came out golden brown and fluffy. I was afraid they might be too sweet but they were just right!

Great, easy soft roll recipe. They were still soft and fresh the next day.Made it by hand and with ingredients pretty much as written. Added more flour during the kneading process- didn't measure, just added a little until I didn't need to anymore.served with dinner the evening before and had them with butter and coffee the next morning.Favorite recipe for delicious,soft, slightly sweet rolls. Would probably make a great loaf too.Made it once stuffed with spinach and parmesan cheese.Next time, I want to top with poppy seeds and maybe make a cross with scissors or a sharp knife. I could go on......

All I can say  is that these  dinner rolls are excellent.  I watched the video and followed it exactly.   The rolls were a big hit.  The came out of the oven looking just like the picture.  You can also make a great sandwhiches and have a great hamburger too.

I have to say, these are the best homemade rolls we've ever made!  We will definitely keep this recipe and make these several times per month.  I'd recommend cooking them for only 12-13 minutes, take them out when they are just barely browning on top.

This recipe is delicious as is!  It also seems to turn out well with minor adaptations (margarine instead of butter, 1 packet yeast instead of a Tbsp., AP flour instead of bread flour).  For a twist, try putting some cheese inside as you form the dough into rolls - then after they come out of the oven, butter the tops and sprinkle with garlic salt.

I will never again buy rolls! This recipe is such a no-brainer, and the result is nothing short of scrumptious! I was amazed that these perked up and rose beautifully in only 30 minutes after being in the bread machine. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I made “Serrano-Cheese Bread” with this recipe & posted a picture! Here are the changes I made~SUGAR: 1 T. , SALT: 11/2  teaspoons,. Cheddar Cheese (reserving a little, for the top of the dough) I do the same with the Serrano peppers. We like heat, so I sliced up 4 good size Serrano peppers, they are a little hotter, and have less of a bell pepper taste than Jalapeños. I don’t have a bread machine, so I start by mixing  Yeast, Sugar & Warm Water, in a large bowl, cover & set in a warm spot until its bobbling & frothy. (10 to 20 mins)  When Yeast mixture is happy, whisk in Egg, 2 Tablespoons melted Butter, & Salt. Use a spoon or plastic dough scraper to work in 2/3rds of the Flour, adding more, as needed. Turn dough out, & Knead for 10-15 mins. I oil the large bowl & wet my hands while kneading. When your dough is happy, shape it into a ball, turning it in the oiled bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, set in warm spot & let dough rise until it’s double in size.  Hopefully you have a box of sterile gloves to wear now, cuz you do not want to do the next step without them! ;-).  Turn dough out onto clean, lightly oiled surface. Use your knuckles to flatten the dough out, now

This is an absolutely fantastic recipie! I have been making it weekly for almost six months, and I have never had a fail. 
I have made it in a bread machine, cuisineart stand mixer, and by hand, and it's been great every time.
I use it for Loaf bread for my family ($.21 a loaf) since it is a lot cheaper, and better tasting with less  in it.  It's versatile as rolls, hotdog and hamburger bun, loaf bread, and pan breads.
The only thing I have done is upped the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup, and I use AP flour. Instead of bread flour, and they are still perfect.

This was just what I was looking for--a light, slightly sweet, soft dinner roll. I kneaded it by hand, but other than that I followed the recipe. Very tasty, easy to make and pretty quick for a homemade yeasted bread. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This bread is awesome.  First 1 1/2 hrs in bread maker another 30 mins to rise in pans, then a 12-15 mins in the oven.I did some minor changes, the first loaf was a little sweet so I put 2 tbsp sugar , instead of 1/4 cup and an extra tsp  flour. My family just love it. Also made bread with this recipe  also awesome

after trying endless rolls, this is by far the best. i used a spoon to scoop the flour into the measuring cup instead of dipping the cup into the flour and it made all the difference in the world.  the dough was light.  i needed a tiny bit of flour when i cut the dough apart to form balls. taste is amazing.  thank you for sharing the recipe

Great recipe. I've made it in a kitchen aid and bread machine. Both worked equally well. I find my bread machine under-kneads dough, so after the second kneading cycle I shut it down and re-start. It adds to prep time but the texture improvement makes it well worth it. Also, I sort of knead and roll into tight balls before putting them into the baking dish to rise. This also improves the texture.

My daughter needed a quick, easy dinner roll recipe to take to a Christmas dinner. These were perfect! As other reviewers mentioned, she didn't use the bread machine, just mixed up the dough by hand, greased a bowl, turned the dough to coat, covered it with plastic wrap & let it rise in a warm place for an hour, punched it down and formed 24 rolls rather than 15, placed them 4 x 6 in a 9x13" pan and let rise for another 1/2 hour, then baked as directed. We didn't have bread flour so used all purpose, just being sure to fluff it first and scoop it lightly into the measuring cup. I also think that the standard 2 1/4 tsp. packet of yeast would have been enough. We happened to have a bit more left over from another recipe, but it didn't come to quite a tablespoon. These turned out what I consider a regular dinner roll size, and she got a lot of compliments!

The only substitution I made was substituting 1/3 of the total amount of flour with whole wheat flour, and it still turned out great.  I didn't use a bread machine, but used the advice of one of the reviewers who made it on her KA - two thumbs up on that procedure.  It's a great way to add some whole grain without the kids even noticing!  Will experiment next time with a 50:50 ratio of regular bread flour and whole wheat flour and see how it turns out.  :-)

I use this to make bread, every kind of bread.  Raisin, Cinnamon, Wheat, and white.  I use exact ingredients, throw them into my Kitchen Aid, first paddle for a few seconds then hook for 10 Let rise for an hour then bake for 35 minutes, tap should sound hollow. Also made rolls as noted.  Just a great, simple and fool proof!

I've made two batches of rolls and another time used it to make two loaves of bread.  I only used 3 cups of bread flour and the dough was perfect each time.  All were fantastic and got rave reviews.  When I made rolls I made 20 rolls from each batch.  Snipping the tops of the rolls with either stripes or an "X" with kitchen shears (as suggested by another reviewer) gave the rolls a professional look.  I brushed the tops of the rolls with a light egg wash instead of butter but used butter on the tops of the loaves of bread.  Both ways turned out great.  This is my new standard bread recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Beth.

This is an awesome recipe. My family loved them. I did use my breadmaker on dough setting, made things fast and easy.

I do not own a bread machine so I followed other reviewers suggestions on making by hand. 
Fantastic! No one could stop eating them! 
If you have the time to make rolls versus buying store bought,  you will not be disappointed.  
Thank you for sharing with us and thank you to those who shared suggestions on making without a bread machine. 
Wonderful!

Best dinner rolls ever! I made them in my kitchen aid mixer. I combined the water, yeast, sugar and let it foam. Then, I combined everything five minutes later. I also added two tablespoons of Italian seasoning and a little parmesan cheese. Delish!

I made these last night and they turned out PERFECT!  Not a single roll left over!
I used my muffin tin to bake them and they looked so pretty!  
My kids devoured them quickly, which says a lot since they are super picky on dinner rolls! 
I am making a triple batch today and freezing the dough balls to bake later!!  
I won't be looking for another recipe again, these are now my only recipe!!

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make. I used muffin tins and made 12 big rolls. Turned out perfect. My husband has already eaten half of them. Will be using it as my go to roll recipe. Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made these, I ended up with a gooey mess that didn't turn out at all because I had too much water and not enough yeast.  The second time I watched the video and prepared it just as the recipe suggested and they came out perfectly.  I needed something quick and easy because I was on a deadline.  They did not disappoint and I'm glad that I gave them a second try. PERFECT.

Love love love these dinner rolls. So buttery and fluffy.  I don't use the bread machine, just my Kitchenaid mixer to mix all the ingredients and then roll them into balls and let them rise in the pan until doubled in size.

I have made these 4 different times. Perfect every time. Only thing I adjusted was the sugar making it 1/2 cup. These don't last long. We also use this recipe as a base for cinnamon rolls.

FINALLY a wonderful bread machine roll recipe! I am not a bread making expert (hence the need for the bread machine). These really are the soft rolls I was looking for that I can make with the bread machine. Note that yhe dough is WAY sticky...but they came out AMAZING! My six year old is super picky and would only eat one type of bakery rolls I bought, and even she said these were wonderful. Did exactly as recipe said

These are delicious!  I have made them over and over again.  Both with and without a bread machine.  Sometimes I make dinner rolls, sometimes larger sandwich/hamburger or hotdog/sub shapes.  And this recipe makes the best Breadsticks!!  After punching down the dough, use a knife to slice into strips, arrange in a pan.  Mix parmesan cheese with the melted butter and brush the tops.  Then do the second rise and bake as directed above.

I have tried several different dinner roll recipes, but this recipe rates among my favorites.  I mixed the dough in my Bosch machine, then put the dough into another mixing bowl and let the dough rise until it had doubled in size. The rolls baked to a beautiful golden brown and were very delicious served warm. They stayed soft for several days, which was very much to my liking!! Great recipe!

I really liked how well these rolls rose, especially since I proofed the yeast in the warm water for a couple mins before adding the other ingredients to the breadmaker.  I found them a little too sweet for my liking and would suggest halving the sugar.  Also it needed about half a cup more flour to help the stickiness decrease.  Anyway, easy to make and got eaten really fast.

Wow, these are WONDERFUL!!!  I didn't make any changes except to add a tiny bit more sugar as we like sweet breads.  Had them for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them.  We'll make them again!
