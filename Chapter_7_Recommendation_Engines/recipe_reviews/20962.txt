This was very good and very ease. Instead of white sauce I used 2 packages of Knorr Alfredo Sauce mix  so I think that gave it a richer flavor.  I also used Barilla no boil lasagna noodles and they worked great.

This was tasty but rather bland.  When I made it, and we ate it immediately, it was pretty runny (liquidy). I think something wasn't quite right with my white sauce. Perhaps a can of creamed condensed soup (cream of broccoli, maybe?) could be used to help thicken the white sauce.  The next day though, the leftovers were absolutely perfect - all the liquid had been soaked up by the noodles! I used fresh broccoli, lightly steamed.  This needed WAY more cooking time than the recipe called for - it had to cook well over an hour.

This recipe needs things.  First the white sauce needs 1 cup of parmesan melted into it.  The ricotta needs a beaten egg mixed in.  It desperately needs a lot of salt and pepper.  I added these things before I made it and I can tell by the reviews that it was a heck of a lot better with these adjustments.

I made this once as written and it was about 3 stars. I liked the idea enough to try it with some changes. 
This time I added the following: 
Veggie part:
Carrots, zucchini and onion to the broccoli and sauteed with more spices.
Added spices:
Onion powder/garlic powder/sea salt/Oregano
Sauce: Added 1 tbl more cornstarch and increased the milk to 3 cups so it would not be watery. Added 1/4 cup fine grated parm then seasoned to taste.
Riccota:
I mixed 2 eggs and 1/4 cup shredded parm and used Sharp White Chedder instead. Seasoned with some white pepper and fresh ground garlic salt mix (Costco)

Layers: I added a little sauce to the veggie mix and made it a separate layer.I think the veggies have too much water in them and make the riccota separate a little and it gets gritty. To fix this, I make a layer with just veggies and one with only the riccota mixture. I spread sauce then noodle then veggie mix, then noodle and then sprinkle some shredded cheese before putting down the riccota layer and then top with last layer of noodle, spread remaining sauce and sprinkle with a little shredded parm and white chedder then sprinkled with some nutmeg or paprika and parsley. Bake uncovered only 30 minutes - too long or hot and the riccota seems to separate. This dish tastes better the next day in my opinion, when the noodles soak up the extra liquid and it sets up. I used a 9x13 but there was left over riccota mix to make a bigger pan unless your pan is really deep.

My husband and i really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the white sauce and used some sharp cheddar cheese in place of 1/2 of the mozzerella.  I also added more salt and pepper than the recipe called for.  This lasagna was just as good the next day for leftovers.  I will definitely make it again.

This lasagna was fantastic! I used the "no boil" noodles and blanched some fresh brocolli. Also, used light mozarella and ricotta cheese. It was my first lasagna ever and will make many, many more times. Thanks for a great recipe...

This was OK, but my family wasn't real thrilled with it.  I thought it was kind of blah.  Not a keeper for me.

This was absolutely delicious!  Very cheesy, and reheats well. I didn't have a 7 x 11 pan, so I crammed it into an 8 x 8.  Doable, but I've since bought the right size pan.

Great meal, but a lot of work. I'm not the most efficient person in the world, but I've never had to clean up so much after one casserole. Overall, it's a wonderful dish, but I think I'll save it for special occassions.

I made quite a few changes and it was GOOD. I added 2 shredded chicken breasts, used fresh broccoli, cream of broccoli soup and a TON of spices (Italian seasoning, garlic, onion, fresh parsley) and added just a hair of extra sharp white cheddar. Yummo.

I used Spinach instead of broccoli

This was really good, I added some fresh mushrooms because I needed to use them up. I found it to be a bit bland and ended up adding salt at the dinner table. But for leftovers it was great after sitting all night in the fridge.

I liked this recipe.  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of using 2 1/2 of milk, I used 1 1/4 cup of fat free half & half and 1 1/4 cup of skim milk just to reduce the fat.  I also added some fresh mozzarella to the broccoli mixture.  I also used the no cook lasagna noodles which were fantastic! I also suggest eating it the day after you cook it.

Kind of bland.  I added some alfredo sauce as suggested by another reviewer and some more garlic than called for and we still thought it was bland.  My husbands reply when I asked if he liked it was "NO!"  It was just okay to me, but probably wouldn't make again.

This was pretty bland. I read a few reviews before making it, so I spiced it up a bit. I used twice as much garlic and used a generous amount of italian seasoning instead of parsley. Parsley won't lend the dish much flavor. I also think there's too much ricotta in it, which probably leeches alot of the flavor too. Probably won't make this again. Too much effort, not enough taste.

I really liked this recipe and so did my boyfriend. It a nice change from traditional red sauce lasagna. After the 30 minutes of cooking time, I took the foil off the top and cooked it a bit more to make the top brown.

Good and easy!! I didn't have ricotta and mozzarella cheese, but it worked fine with similar cheeses, and I added a little of goat cheese too and it gave an excellent flavour to it :)

Awesome alternative to traditional lasagna!!! I made some minor changes to lower the fat and calories.  I omitted the butter and instead add garlic and onion powder to the white sauce.  This is a definite keeper!

This was pretty bland.  I did cream of broccoli instead of the white sauce, added more garlic and italian seasoning and replaced the standard noodles for whole wheat noodles, but the flavor still wasn't great.  Don't think I will make this again.

This was ok. I added a ton of extra-sharp Cheddar cheese to improve the flavor, and I omitted the nutmeg as I don't like it in savory dishes. I used fresh broccoli - I've cooked with frozen in the past, and didn't like all the woody stems - and it wasn't cooked even after 40 mins. This was good for a change but I doubt I'll make it again.

This may be the lowest rating I have ever given to a recipe.  There was NO flavor to this meal. I followed the recipe to a T and will not make this ever again.  I should have taken heed to other reviewers and omitted the white sauce entirely and used a jar of Alferdo instead.

This was a great basic recipe. I used it with fettucine noodles, and thought the amount of salt was just right. However, it wouldn't be difficult to add more for those who like things saltier.

Very plain.  I thought it was pretty good but my husband didn't even want me to keep the leftovers (which isn't a good sign).  Definetely something missing--needs spices or herbs.  Just OK!

Definately not a recipe for a food buff!  My family could hardly palate it.  It was very dry and the broccoli was too mushy.  Could definately use some spicing up.

This recipe took a little longer to prepare than twenty minutes.  I substituted cayenne for white pepper and sharp cheddar cheese on top instead of more mozzarella.  I thought the recipe sounded like it needed a kick! It was delicious!  It would make a fabulous dish to bring to a potluck dinner.

This was an interesting dish. My family enjoyed it. The white sauce is also good on homemade pizza. It might need a little more salt but otherwise it was great.  I only used 1 1/2 cups milk I think it turned out better that way. Depending on many people you are serving I would recommend this.

it's okay....it needs more spices.
But the broccoli and the ricotta cheese go great together! 
Try adding some alfredo sauce maybe to replace the bland white sauce

This recipe took longer to prepare than stated. I used Barilla no-boil lasagna and it turned out good. Next time I will use more noodles. Although the taste was good, it was a little bland. I would definitely make this again.

Yummy recipe, I too took the foil off and cooked about 15 minutes longer, then broiled it for five minutes to brown the cheese.  My whole family loved it!  Thanks!

It's a keeper! This baked out to be a great dinner for us. I would absolutely make this again, even my picky husband loved it. I made it as written but added some extra seasoning and found this dish to be very flavorful.

We just used the white sauce portion of the recipe and used it over shell pasta.  Very simple and yummy.  It used an entire bag of pasta.

This recipe is loaded with potential. We served leftovers with grilled salmon and the flavor of the fish helped with the plain-ness of the lasagna. Next time I will use this recipe as a base and add more interesting foods and flavors to it.

This was a quick and easy dinner, especially if you use the no-boil lasagne nooodles. I did opt to use fresh broccoli, which I steamed in the microwave till it was crisp-tender. I also substituted some monterey jack cheese for part of the mozzarella cheese the recipe calls for. Turned out great!

This was a big hit with the entire family!  It reminds me of white/broccoli pizza that you get from a pizzaria!!  It was sooo good that if you don't like broccoli, you could omit it and the lasagna would still be great!

My family loved this recipe! It was easy to make for a lasagna.  My company asked for the recipe; and the kids had 2nd and 3rd helpings. (They even ate the broccoli!) I did make one change though...I took the foil off and baked it an extra 15 minutes to brown the cheese. Delicious!

I followed the recipe with these changes; added pre-cooked chicken, marjoram instead of parsley, and no-cook, gluten-free lasagna noodles. I have not laughed so much in quite some time!  The sauce was tasty, but I'm not sure if there just wasn't enough of it or if the issue was due to the type of noodles I used.  The result? I broke into hysterics every time my husband crunched.  I might try again, but not any time soon.

I passed on the ricotta & added two eggs to that mixture instead. I also increased the overall motz to three cups. It reminds me of something that I used to eat during my pregnancy. It was a jewel brand presidents choice vegetable lasagna that is no longer available, I'm so glad that I came across this recipe!

The first time I made it, I decided it needed a can of mushrooms and more garlic.  Next time I made it, I added an extra tomato, chopped, and the mushrooms and some garlic powder, it rocks! I also tend to add a little more cheese, but that's me.
