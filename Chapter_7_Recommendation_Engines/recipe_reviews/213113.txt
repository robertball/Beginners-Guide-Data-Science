What a great, light and tasty dessert after some heavy hot curries! Couldn't find rose syrup so substituted rose water in the same quantity without problems, also we only used 0.1 grams of saffron - very tasty.

Very nice ice cream.  I made it to take to a Diwali dinner.
I used Haagen Daz vanilla 1 qt and 1 pint.  I did not have cardamom, which I somehow ran out of, so I omitted it.  
I used one large Tbls of rose syrup as I was afraid it would be too sweet.  I used a small pinch of saffron and I finely chopped the roasted and salted pistachios (from a package), thinking a bit of salt would enhance flavor, before adding into the softened ice cream.   It is now sitting in a souffl√© dish in the freezer.  I tasted it after it was all mixed together and I am glad I cutback on the rose syrup.  I think the next time I'll use a full pinch of saffron and the cardomom for sure.   I imagine I'll need to dry out the rose petals first and will add them tomorrow with a light dusting of pistachios on the ice cream.
Maybe a 5 star but since I've not tasted it frozen it'll be 4 for now.   Very pretty with very little effort.

What a  nice ice cream.I couldn't find rose syrup but I used rose water,3 cap fulls. The rose flavor is not overpowering and makes this ice cream very delicate. The spices add a nice flavor making it very Indian and with the crunch of pistachio nuts this dessert is a wonderful way to finish a dinner. I used some drops of food coloring to make it pink simulating the color of a rose.

Made this to go with a night of Indian fare. It was light and very flavorful, and the slight hint of rose was amazing.  I do suggest freezing for longer than 2 hours after mixing as it wasn't quite frozen enough for my taste. Also I used a mixer to fold everything in for me and it worked out much better.

Had this dish at an Afghani restaurant and wanted to reproduce it.  This is a wonderfully similar dessert.  Thank you!
