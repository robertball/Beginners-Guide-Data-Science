I made these this weekend for my daughter's babyshower. Everybody loved
them. I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. Towards the end of making them I had extra crab filling (just because I'm bad
about measuring "exact" amounts) so my last few muffins had an extra tsp. or so of filling and it didnt make a difference in the baking process and I liked those ones the best. delish! thank you Chef John

DO NOT USE CANNED CRAB!!! 

I used canned crab and it was horrid, I used that expensive refrigerated "real" claw crab meat... expensive too. Yeah it was bad, like absolutely horrible, crab was not expired or anything it was just bad! I followed recipe to a tee and it was just bad. 

If you cant find or afford REAL crab, use some of the imitation crab and add some cream cheese to the mixture. Also I recommend adding a little sugar, maybe a tablespoon or so to the corn mixture... it's too dull and boring if you use the imitation crab, if you use real fresh crab, let the crab be the star. Otherwise... don't do it.

I loved the idea, but since I didn't have any of the Asian Chili Paste on hand, I had to go another route by substituting Old Bay Seasoning and some cayenne pepper to perk it up.  Along with a salad, it was a great recipe for a Saturday lunch!  We loved it!!!

I'm always looking for ways to eat crab as we catch so many of them on our beach vacations. I made this as written except I used a sweet chili sauce instead of the paste (as the paste had MSG in it and we don't eat MSG). It was really good with the fresh clam chowder we made. I liked the pepperjack cheese in it for a kick too! I'll be keeping this recipe and making it again when we get more fresh crab!

This is my favorite recipe. It is very important to use fresh crab meat in this recipe.  I love spicy dishes so I added extra chopped red chillis to the mix.  In addition to spring onions, I also added chopped corriander.   Thank you for this delicioius dish Chef John!

These were good, but a bit on the bland side. The filling was really good, but I think that the corn muffin part needed more salt/flavor. These were really easy to make and I do like the idea, so I will play around w/ them. Thanks for sharing. :)

I folllowed this recipe to the letter. Love the concept but we thought the actual corn muffin was really bland. The crab meat stuffin' was ok but not that flavorful. They came out with a nice golden color. I will try this again and tweak it along the way. I'm going to make my stuffing more of a crab cake concept. Once I try it again, I will repost.

I loved the basic idea for these but they just didn't have much flavor. The corn muffin was just over powering on what little flavor they did have. Great idea but it needs some tweaking to be as good as it sounded.
