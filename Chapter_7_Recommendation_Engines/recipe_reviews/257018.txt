2.10.17   I make a lot of pancakes, so I know the batter consistency that will yield the perfect pancakes for us.  The pancake batter was very thick, so I did add substantially more water than indicated, at least double, maybe even triple.  The only thing that I did differently was to fold my blueberries into the batter rather than placing them on the top of the pancakes once theyâ€™re on the griddle.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand), and it brought just a little tang to the pancakes and the blueberries give you a  juicy burst of sweetness.  Tender, moist, and simply good!

The almond flavor was a nice surprise. I did not use as much to make sure it did not over power the pancakes. Instead of yogurt we used sour cream to compliment the sweet blueberries. If you want to make your pancakes extra fluffy, try beating the egg whites and sugar together. Then add that mixture to your pancake batter.

I agree that the batter was too thick and added probably 1/2 cup of water to get the right consistency. In any case it was great! Made a couple without blueberries which were also good. I like berry syrup in lieu of maple.

Absolutely the best pancakes I've ever had! Fluffy and yummy-I think the almond extract is the secret ingredient! Will definitely make this again!

Very solid pancake recipe. Good textured fluffy pancake. I left out the almond flavor because I was looking for a basic blueberry pancake recipe. Also did add about 1/2 cup of water instead of the 1/4 c.

These were awesome. We had fresh blueberries and I toasted some almonds and crushed them. We sprinkled them on top. Will definitely make again!

Best recipe I've ever had from this site. Easy to make & very light & fluffy. I beat the 2 eggs thoroughly before adding the other ingredients. To make it even more healthy I added crushed chia seeds and a 1 Cup of water as the chia seeds naturally thicken the batter. Sometimes I fry them in a little coconut oil as a variation.

This was a perfect recipe because I didn't have any milk in the house but had greek yogurt.  The only change I made was to use vanilla instead of almond extract.  I used vanilla flavored greek yogurt.  I used 1/2 cup of water to make a perfect consistency. Of course, having fresh Michigan blueberries helped make the pancakes extra yummy.  It made 7 pretty large pancakes. Good for about 4 hungry people.

Followed recipe exactly and they where delicious. Total amount of water that I added: just under 1/2 cup. Added the blueberries as pancakes were cooking. (My husband does not like blueberries. ). Had leftover batter which i stored in the fridge and 2 days later added about 2 tablespoons (leftover canned) crushed pineapple with juice). Made 4 pancakes and they were delicious.

I tried to make this on Father s Day for my husband. I liked the taste but my husband disagreed. He didn t like the tart taste of the blueberries.
