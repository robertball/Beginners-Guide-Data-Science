This is a terrific Vegan/Vegetarian soup recipe. Since I have a variety of eaters in my family from vegan to carnivores I love it when I find something they all like and will eat. I usually make it in a stock pot on the stove with homemade veggie broth and add different veggies depending on what I have on hand. It’s also delicious with a few chopped tomatoes thrown in. This is the kind of recipe you can change up a lot with chicken or beef broth/meat, but I like this veggie version. It’s light and healthy tasting while still very satisfying. I serve it with the perfect accompaniment...a big loaf of hot crusty chiabatta or sourdough bread. Delicious!

I put in 4 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups water. It was very good! You could add or take away from this easy soup. Would make again. There's nothing like coming home to a great smelling house.

Let me preface this by stating that I don't consider this "potato soup", it's more of a vegetable soup. But after changing up a few things such as adding a couple more different veggies, seasoning, using fewer potatoes, etc this is definitely a comfort food. It turned out really well and of course with a crockpot you can throw everything in and walk away. No having to stand over the stove when you have other things to do. But it can be cooked on the stove if you don't have a crockpot also. I made a loaf of homemade white bread  (in the bread machine, I had a busy day so all of this was a perfect time saver) and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I'll be making this again! But for true potato soup I'll stick to my own original recipe that I've been using for over 30+ years.

I made changes and added sliced mushrooms, diced green pepper. Used herbs for soup since I didn't have sage. I expected it to be a little more hearty and I would not shred carrots. I blended some of it, reminded me of pea soup, but not as thick. Add more potatoes next time. I'll give it another try.

A little salty.  I'll cut down on the quantity the next time.  The soup had a very good flavor and was pretty easy to assemble.

This was a great tasty recipe that you can add/subtract/substitute to your tastes. The only additions I made were to add some quinoa and bok choy that I needed to get rid of. Very easy, will make this again.

I beefed up the spices, it was a bit bland - tasted as it cooked to enhance.  And I used Veg broth with the water. A good way to use some special potatoes, like Yukon Gold.

Excellent recipe. I followed almost everything exactly... except... I didn't have Vegetable Powder so I used 4 Bouillon cubes ( 1 cube per 2 cups of water). Then I omitted the salt called for in the recipe because of all the salt already in the bouillon.
We served with warm buttered bread and a salad.

Really great, we NEVER  go meatless and I didn't miss it here.
I'll be taking leftovers for lunch until its gone..it's that good.

Had some spuds that were in danger of passing their useful life so I tried this.  I did make some changes: I peeled them, used homemade vegan stock instead of water and powder, and I replaced the salt with .75 tsp seasoned sea salt and .75tsp maple/thyme sea salt.  Not the sort of soup folks expect from me; but, all enjoyed it.  Serves more than six.  It could easily have served 9/10 as a soup course.

As my daughter said, "It is just potatoes floating around in water."  And rather than the 8.5 cups of water, I used a combination of vegetable and chicken broth, and still, absolutely NO flavor.  I pureed it to try to get more texture, and it perhaps is a little more edible than before, but I still can't convince anyone in  my house to eat it. Tasteless.

Unfortunately this was not liked by my family.
It just did not have any taste.  It’s the first recipe
That didn’t work out for me.

My husband made this for dinner last night and it was delicious! He doesn’t venture into the kitchen very often, so I was a little concerned when he said he wanted to try this. He added smoked sausage (no surprise to me that he wanted a meat element), but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Wow! I’m sure that either one of us will be cooking this again. Thanks, Sonte!

It's wonderful soup, but I wouldn't call it potato soup.  It's more of just a vegetable soup.  We added browned hamburger because my husband always wants MEAT!

Very tasty! I sliced the carrots and omitted the salt. I used 2 tablespoons of "Better than Bullion" vegetable. This isn't a creamy potato soup, but it's a very nice hearty vegetarian vegetable soup. I didn't really measure out the amount of veggies. I used 4 carrots and 4 stalks of celery.  Plus a whole bag of small multicolored potatos. I think this recipe is pretty forgiving and you could put in whatever veggies yu want.  There's a lot of broth, which I like. Good for dipping your bread. I didn't have to adjust the seasonings at all. Perfect for a cold winter evening! I'm going to serve with grilled cheese tonight.

As I usually do, I doubled the recipe, but this one didn't work well that way.  It seemed to be too heavy on the herb taste so I put it in the food processor and made more of a cream soup style.  It was better that way but unfortunately, not my favourite.  Still, hearty & healthy.....

I liked this soup. I gave it 4 stars simply because I thought it needed a good bit more salt but that that's a personal preference. Simple to make and simple is good.

This potato soup was a huge hit myself and my hubby. I had a hard time finding vegetable broth powder so I just used vegetable broth bullion cubes and broke it up. I also added extra beef broth. Yummy!
