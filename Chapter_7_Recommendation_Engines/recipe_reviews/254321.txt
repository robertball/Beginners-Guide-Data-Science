1.18.17   If you’re wondering what size dish to use as I was, I used a 9”x13” dish, and my brownies baked up to about 1-1/2” high.  Sorry, a “deep baking pan” easily could have been clarified to a specific size, I just guessed looking at the amount of batter.  This recipe has a pound of chocolate chips in it, so I didn’t think it needed another 1 cup of sugar and cut that to 1/2 cup ( could be a personal taste preference thing). I like nuts in brownies, so I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Also, watch your time and check your brownies, as mine were done in 45 minutes.  Chocolate and banana are good partners, and you definitely will taste that layer of banana.  Nice texture, nice flavor, and good brownies!

Very good cake, not brownies. I made in a smaller pan and then in a bigger pan, both were good. Smaller pan was done at 45 minutes. Used about 1/3 c splenda mix for baking instead of full amt sugar as called for, and was plenty sweet. Banana flavor is not strong, but just enough. Great with whipped cream.

Super yummy! I used 5 smaller bananas and added extra egg. only took 55 minutes to bake. fluffier than regular brownie, but moist. I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to batter and sprinkled larger pieces on top before baking. Great combo of chocolate, banana, and nuts.

I did make this.  Everything went perfectly. Except I missed the Footnotes.  I used 3 Bananas & 4 eggs. Which I believe is why it is so fluffy.  But very very yummy with a crisp top.  So if you too follow the directions solely as written.
