This was very yummy. Somenone blessed us with sliced ham. I threw everything in a sauce pan, cut up the ham slices and tossed everything together. Served it on brown and serve buns. I did end up adding 3tb orange juice instead of two on the count of my honey. I use a very strong honey. Over all, this is a keeper. Thank you !

This is one of the best Hams that I have ever made!  I actually doubled the recipe so I had plenty of glaze on hand.  I made my ham the day before so I wanted to be able to rebaste it for reheating the next day.  Came out wonderful and I'm so glad that I tried this.  This is now going to be my stock ham recipe!  My family loved it and I couldn't keep my husband away from it!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was to add a little liquid smoke, my husband doesn't like extremely sweet sauces.  Very easy to make!

Best glaze. Ever!  I wanted a new glaze to try and had all the ingredients on hand.  It turned out to be the best glaze I've ever made!  If you're tired of the usual mustard/brown sugar glaze, then this one is for you!  And yes, the almond does add a little something extra to it!

Excellent & easy - no changes needed. I had all the goodies ready for our Christmas dinner...but forgot about the glaze for the ham. With all the stores closed, I had to find a recipe I could make with the ingredients I had in the house. Everyone loved it!

This is a really good recipe with understated sweetness.  I use a bone-in ham and the un-used glaze is served on the side.

I  made incisions across the top of the ham prior to cooking.
After the first hour  of cooking when I applied the sauce it seeped through the cracks......

I made this recipe for Easter and it was a huge hit. I did everything exactly as the recipe called and I will say that I don't think I would change anything if I made it again.  It is perfect as is.

This was my first time making ham glaze and everyone LOVED it! I followed allrecipe's video on how to cook a ham and the ham turned out great. I used allspice instead of clove.

Made this as is and it was pretty good, I might double this one next time and slice the ham the last 15 - 20 minutes so the glaze really coats the ham.

This was the first time I had ever made a ham.  It was Easter and I wanted something simple and low maintenance, in efforts to not mess it up, plus I had a lot of other foods being cooked simultaneously.  My family and friends LOVED it!  There wasn't much left over, however my 7 year old daughter asked me to make her a ham sandwich everyday for lunch until it was completely gone.  I'm not much of a ham person, however I thought it was delicious as well.  Once this ham was gone, my family asked me to make another one right away!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Really good and easy.   I had a 7.5 lb ham and found that cutting this recipe in 1/2 made plenty of glaze. Really delicious on my spiral ham.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great. I added in a little orange zest, but otherwise followed the recipe. The glaze gave the ham a deliciously sweet flavor.

Used a precooked ham, doubled the sauce and heated till heated through. Love the sauce. Using leftovers in ham fried rice and wish I had even more sauce to douse that with.

I made this recipe as is except that I added sliced pineapple to the bottom of the pan about half way through the cooking time.  My son, who is not a huge ham fan, loved this ham and said that the pineapple tasted like candy.  Try it!

I was really surprised at how delicious it turned out. I am not a fan of really fruity or sweet with meats but these  flavors  was so subtle and not sweet at all. Wonderful flavor of cinnamon and citrus. Will make this again.

I found this recipe for my daughter who begged me to glaze our holiday ham and I couldn't be happier with it!  I took another reviewer's recommendation and added some liquid smoke (I just eyeballed it - probably ended up being around 1/4 tsp.) and I also added the optional almond extract.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as written and I love how this glaze is not overly sweet and has some wonderful spice notes from the cinnamon & cloves.  You can double the recipe and use the reserve the remaining glaze for guests to drizzle over their meal as well.  This one's a keeper!

I did make some changes. the recipe itself no but while cooking the ham. I made it in a nesco roaster and sliced 2 oranges into medium to thick slices and laid them on the bottom. then i put my ham in the roaster and poured about a half a cup of ginger ale over top of the ham and let it cook for an hour. After that is when I basted with the glaze every 10 to 15 minutes, for about another 45 minutes. After about 2 hours I unplugged the nesco and took the ham out to cool, since i was using my ham to make sandwiches with for our Christmas dinner. It turned out really delicious and I plan to continue using this method for the next several years until i need a change in flavor.

Made this for Easter and it was wonderful!  Had my daughter and son-in- law over and they loved it.  My daughter likes the sweet things but me not so much. But, to my surprise the cinnamon, oj and gr. cloves gave me the flavor that didn't make me mind the sweetness.  I kept right to the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.

An easy glaze to make. I liked the orange honey glaze. I added oranges and maraschino cherries which my family liked.

I absolutely love this glaze!!! My ham came out perfect. Only thing I didn't have no almond extract but added a little brown sugar to and it still came out really good..

Was excellent on our ham. We stayed with the cooking directions for our 10lb ham and just covered it with the glaze after it was done cooking, returning it to a 400 degree oven for ten minutes to let it set in, putting the leftover glaze in a bowl for individual use at the table. I added a bit of brown sugar just because I love the flavor, and it was great.
