Just for fun, I added 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese to the pan, and 2 Tblsp of parmesan. I'm sure the recipe would be great without this, but it added a little extra flavor.
GREAT RECIPE

I was really afraid to try this with lobster and used crab meat instead....wow this was wonderful.  I can not wait to make it like it was intended.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent recipe, Joni.  I followed the recipe as written and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of flavor from such simple ingredients.  I made four smaller, individual casseroles instead of one larger one.  This dish sells for  $17.99 (for one serving) at my favorite seafood restaurant and it's not nearly as tasty...but we won't tell them...we'll keep it our secret.

i will do this one again and just remember to cook the lobster slow and low heat and take the skin off the lobster before cooking it and maybe some salt and pepper won't hurt either thanks!!!

I made this with crab meat instead of lobster (too expensive) and it turned out so good!  I was surprised at how tasty it was considering the small amount of ingredients involved.  I did have to add more butter to the pan after sauteing the meat, and the flour was a little lumpy.  But I whisked almost non-stop until it blended together.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little more flavor.  This dish is rich, so I would plan the rest of your meal accordingly.

Mmmm, Mmmm good!!!! Very nice, warm, rich creamy taste.  It was so delicious that my husband and I were selfish...no sharing with our friends or family.  This recipe we kept to ourselves.

OMG!! This was fabulous.  You must follow the recipe EXACTLY about not cooking too long.  I modified this to be 1/2 lb lobster tail meat and 1/2 lb shrimp to cut down the cost.  Served with fresh asparagus and a bit of angel hair pasta and of course champagne.  It made the perfect romantic dinner.  My guest brought flowers and chocolate to round it out.

We have fresh lobster on hand during he summer months and I am always looking for different lobster recipes.  I did add this to my recipe book and will put this into the rotation. Now I wish we had put out more pots this year. This is tasty and the lobster holds it own even with the other ingrediants. Next time I make it I may try to add some other seafood and additional lobster. By the way, I did include some Old Bay to season it. I am from Maryland and add it to all my seafood dishes.

This was okay. Where I live, seafood is at a premium price and so would much rather eat the real meat and not complicate it with added ingredience. I used almost 2 lbs. of crab legs to get one pound of meat for this recipe.  That cost me an arm and a leg. Cost the crab an arm and a leg, too!  :)

I had a one pint container of leftover lobster (that I picked out of the shell) from a special occasion a couple of days ago. I wanted to use it up with a recipe that was more 'dinner' like instead of cold lobster salad, so I came to (of course!) allrecipes.com and plugged in my special ingredient. There weren't many 'hot' lobster recipes, but this one stood out. I didn't have cream or regular bread so I used whole milk and rye bread. I also added a little sharp cheddar and parmesan (less than a cup total of both) to the sauce, along with just a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning (just because I like things kicked up a tad). I husband raved the rest of the night about this AND I think it took me LESS time to make than the recipe actually called for! LOVE that on a weeknight! I know I changed a few things on this recipe and gave it 5 stars, but I really think it's the kind of recipe that you can tweak to make it your own with just a 'little here and a little there'. Enjoy!

This was fantastic!!! It is very rich though. I didn't have dry mustard so I just used the prepared mustard. Gave some to my friend to taste and she thought it was great. I would definitely make this again.

Loved it!! Ive had this similar dish in Boston, but instead of the bread they used Ritz crackers - my only concern with your ingredients with crackers instead of bread would be the salt. Maybe Ill try low sodium Ritz.

I thought this was really good, but my family thought it was too "seafood" tasting.  I will have to agree, it had a really strong lobster taste, but was still good.  I will try crab meat next time and see if it's as strong.

I tried this recipe substituting half & half for the milk and heavy cream and crushed Ritz crackers for the sliced bread. It was extremely delicious!!  I've made it three times so far.  I generally double the ingredients, and my wife and I get three meals from the recipe.  It tastes just as good warmed over in the microwave as it does right out of the oven.

I'm not a huge lobster fan, but someone gave me lobster tails so I used them in this. Added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to sauce per other reviewer's suggestion. VERY rich and yummy, will make again when I have more free lobster!

I scaled this down for one and used some leftover lobster I had in the freezer.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used milk.  My last tweak was using bread crumbs.  Would make this again.

Yummy!!!!  I have made this once and will be making it very often!  Since we are inland I used imitation lobster meat and it still was great.  I can't wait to try it with real lobster.  The only suggestion I have is to add some garlic.  I also put fresh Parmesan cheese on my portion since bf doesn't eat cheese.

I'm sorry, this recipe was awful. My family and I love lobster and I had high hopes for this one, but the taste was just not at all appetizing. My brother spit out the bite he took, and the rest I had to throw away.

I agree with at least one other reviewer. Used 1 pound real crab meat to substitute for the lobster since lobster not available at store this eve. All other ingredients were as suggested by the recipe. The outcome was not good. I am not confident that lobster would help. Glad other people had some better results. It wouldn't sting so much if it weren't such a pricey loss.

This was ok, but not great.  I would have preferred to eat the lobster with drawn butter instead of camoflaging it with all of the other stuff.

So so good! This recipe is so easy and delicious. Restaurant quality. I did add a little bit of old bay; and I mean a little. Lol. I only had half and half so I used that instead of the heavy cream. I bought two tails which were 8oz total. I added 8oz of imitation crab too. I cooked it in my cast iron, (less dishes and I love cast iron cooking). I broiled the last couple seconds to brown it up! Thanks for the recipe, it’ll be in rotation since my family raved about it!

I crumbled ritz crackers combined them with a little melted butter and put on top for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Delicious

We love in NH and have lobster on sale often. I used the leftovers to make this and my husband love it! Instead of stirring the bread into the lobster I crushed ritz crackers and bread together and stirred with melted butter then put that on top on the lobster mixture. Will definitely make again!

I had about 1/2 lb imitation crabmeat on hand so I went with that and halved the sauce. After reading some of the negative reviews, I decided to add touches that I knew I would like. The crab did not have to be sauteed, so I just added it to the finished sauce. To the sauce, I also added 1 tblsp of mayo, garlic powder, a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese and celery seed (a good sub for Old Bay seasoning and a great addition to seafood dishes). The sauce seemed a little dry, so I added 1 tblsp+ of white wine. The end result was very moist, but it was not in a lot of sauce (next time I wouldn't have the sauce). I enjoyed this with a cold glass of sauvignon blanc on this hot summer day. This would also work great with any seafood. Thanks for the great starting point!

This is the best lobster casserole. I have made it exactly to the recipe and also not exactly to the recipe. Only changes were i didn't have heavy cream so i used the combined amount of milk. Also used prepared mustard because i didn't have the dry. I also save the tomalley and mix it with ritz crackers and a little butter for a topping. Delicious!

We just loved this casserole.  I used Panera Bread, which is a substantial white bread, and was a couple of days old.... perfect!  I also added 1/2 cup shredded white cheddar, so I increased the milk just a little to keep consistency the same.  That added just a hint of cheese flavor, which we like.  I'm sure it would be great without the cheese too.  I will keep this as one of my alltime favorites.

Delicious! Being in the midwest, where lobster is expensive, I used imitation crab meat. I also used milk instead of the heavy cream to make it a little healthier. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added some Old Bay. Very good, perfect comfort food!
