Thank you for sharing your recipe.  It is wonderful getting people enjoying Slovak food.  However, as a Slovak who has grown up with this dish, I am quite surprised by your addition of baking powder and egg.  None of these exist in traditional haluški, and if anything the egg will make these delicious potato pillows tougher.  Please please next time omit the eggs and baking powder, and you'll actually be eating a traditional dish.  P.S.  Mixing sheep milk feta with a bit of sour cream to mimic the traditional bryndza sheep cheese works quite well too.  Dobrú chut'!

I used the fine grater in my food processor for the potatoes.  In Slovakia, my cousin uses Yukon Gold type potatoes and those seem to work well.  I did need a bit more flour than the recipe called for, but it depends on the amount of moisture in the potatoes. I gauged it according to how the dough held together in the boiling water. I used Bryndza (sheep cheese) instead of Brick cheese because we can get it in Chicago and it is more authentic.  Yummy!

Our family made Haluski at least once a month for 5 decades and we would have it with a cold sweet/sour lettuce and bacon pieces salad. Just add a few tablespoons of regular vinegar with a heaping tablespoon of sugar and add cracked pepper if you like.  That's the whole meal besides a beverage like good old ice-cold lemonade. Sticks to the ribs!!

My Slovak grandmother would make this for us frequently. It was most often served as the 'noodles' for beef - tomato soup. My favorite though was when she had some left over and she would fry the 'bullets' in butter to a golden brown. Nothing in the world better than that...

Wow so cool that this dish is on line, I grew up eating and making this with my mom and grandma. We did not add the potato to the dough though. And we simplified the cheese and started using cottage cheese for cost reasons, so we call it bacon, cottage cheese and halushka. I still have my great great great grandma's haluski board and I'm using it today. Love love love this stuff thanks for sharing.

Just how I remembered it tasting when my Mom made it years ago.  I like to top with green onions too. This recipe was really special to me. I made it for my father's memorial ceremony since it was his favorite growing up.  Thank you for posting this. :)
