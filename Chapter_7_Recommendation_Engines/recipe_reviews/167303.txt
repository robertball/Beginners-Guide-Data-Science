This was incredibly easy to make. I sifted all the dry ingredients together then added the wet all at once. I just mixed until moistened, didn't overmix. I did add 1 tbsp. of lemon juice to the milk to make it like buttermilk and I had to add a little more milk as the batter was a bit dry. I liked this, it's like something you'd buy at Starbucks to go with your coffee. If I made this again, I'd add a little vanilla and double the glaze. This is a very eye-pleasing loaf. Bakes up beautifully.

This was a big hit at Church, I had coffee hour and made all breads.  I followed the recipe exactly. Good lemon flavor along with the blueberries.  Wonderful!!  This will be a permanent in my recipe box.

I would only recommend that if this bread is not going to be eaten within a day or so, not putting the lemon glaze on top; it seemed to make the bread top a bit soggy.  Over all though, an absolutely fabulous bread, wonderful flavor and I enjoy sharing it with everyone!

Had a huge bag of lemons and bags of frozen blueberries to use up. Made the Lemon Blueberry Bread from this site on Sunday and loved it. But, got curious to compare this recipe and I made it on Monday. Yummy...my new favorite lemon blueberry combination!! The extra blueberries and the sour cream makes this so moist. I like a more pronounced lemon flavor, so used 3 T of lemon juice and 2 T of lemon zest in the batter instead of whatever was produced by 1 lemon. Drizzling with  lemon glaze is going to make this a perfect summer dessert...I can't wait to try it in a bundt pan this weekend.

This is wonderful--we loved the tangy combo of fresh lemon and blueberries, and using sour cream makes it very moist. It also freezes well--I made 2 loaves, one to eat right away, one to freeze. Thanks for sharing!

Just wanted to say - if you want a strong lemon flavour, zest the WHOLE lemon.  That wasn't totally clear in the instructions.  Use a medium sized lemon.  TABLESPOON

This loaf is moist, tangy, and fresh tasting. The ingredient list is typical pantry fair, and the preparation is both quick and easy. The resulting loaf is both aesthetically pleasing and quite appetizing. The fact that this recipe uses a mere 1/2 a stick of butter is a definite plus. I will be making this over and over again, and enjoying it each and every time.

This was great - nice flavor.  I made a double batch, with one set of muffins and one loaf.  The cupcakes took about 30 min to bake.  It was delicious!

Where have you been all my life?  I've tried so many others - only to be left unsatisfied!  ThIS is the taste I have been seeking!  So I made two!
The second one I added some lemon rind to the batter and used some fresh blueberries (wow)!  Then I made a thicker more icing-type drizzle to put on top of it all!
My kids and husband claimed them as "imperfect" and therefore "must be eaten immediately to protect moms reputation" - so, neither had time to cool completely and both are gone!  I got one small piece of each........

Not really a fair review because I changed the recipe and used a brown sugar crumble on top instead of the lemon juice/confectioners' sugar topping.  Overall I didn't care for the texture and the flavor was only OK.

Very Good, Moist, sliced well, needed to add 10 minutes to baking time for a glass loaf pan.  Would double icing next time.

This is my favorite quick-bread.  I used the powdered lemon zest from Penzys.  What a delicious combination!  And it freezes well.

I really enjoyed this cake/loaf. As I'm from Australia I'm not used to such sweet things being called a bread and eating this for breakfast? It seems like a dessert or something sweet to have with coffee which I guess explains breakfast ;-) I didn't add the topping but put the zest of 2 lemons in the cake. The step to roll the blueberries in the flour worked well. I also used 1 cup of all purpose and 2/3 cup of wholemeal. My cake was moist and had a good lemon flavour. Thanks

Delicious! I doubled the glaze because I like my loafs lemony :D All in all it was super easy and tasty, my 7 year old wanted this for dessert instead of ice cream!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this without the glaze. Some people say the glaze is what makes the loaf so good, but I was concerned that it would get soggy since there were only two of us eating it and it needed to last awhile. Even without the glaze, it was quite good. I did add extra lemon juice, just tasting a small amount of the batter and adding more lemon juice until I could really taste a strong lemon flavor. If you opt to make it without the glaze, consider adding a little more sugar if you want a really sweet loaf. Without the glaze, it's good but not particularly sweet.

This bread had an odd texture for me. I don't think it's a bad recipe just a little odd for me. My grandpa really liked it so I gave it four stars. Very easy to make!

I made this almost exactly as directed, baked in a metal bread pan. The only change was I used up my fresh blueberries rather than frozen. It was a super easy recipe; no mixer required. I didn't even have to wait for butter to come to room temp, since it calls for melted butter. I couldn't wait for it to cool and ate the first slice piping hot! It turned out perfect! Very moist, distinct lemon flavor, tender crumb. I especially like that it's not overly rich -- so many sweet loaves are very high in calories. A keeper!

My daughter likes sour foods so she really liked this recipe but I wasn't such a fan of the lemon-blueberry combo. The lemon brought out the tartness of the blueberry.

My lemon was monstrous, so I had enough zest, but probably too much juice. It took an hour and 20 to bake and is very dense, maybe because of the extra liquid factor. Delicious though. I had to change the recipe because I don't eat wheat or cow dairy, so I used a mix of brown rice flour and oat flour, as well as vanilla goat yogurt instead of sour cream. I'll probably make this again because it's so flavourful, even though I expected it to be a lighter texture.
Edit: Okay, with only two slices left in the loaf, I have changed my rating to 5 stars from 4 and will say absolutely will make again. The flavour is fantastic. I think the vanilla in the goat yogurt adds some extra goodness. Tonight I have made the same recipe with raspberries. It's in the oven now...

Very good, but very time consuming to make because you have to mix everything separate. The blueberries came out perfect! I really like the idea of placing them in flour first; it prevents them from being soggy. I suggest tripling the lemon icing for the top and also adding a couple more tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter.

I don't write many reviews, but this was so good that I felt obligated to. 

I usually omit toppings and reduce the sugar in recipes like this, but the amounts looked acceptable, so I made it exactly as written. The sweetness was perfect, and the topping really "put it over the top". DON'T SKIP THE TOPPING!!! The loaf was moist, but not soggy. Really just a great recipe.

Fast and easy to make and very tasty. I doubled the lemon juice/sugar topping but reduced the sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup and it was sweet enough.  Trying again today but with strawberries as blueberries cost a fortune here in Costa Rica.

I made this with my sisters to take for our family Thanksgiving dinner.  We decided to make it in a Pampered Chef bread tube we found at the Goodwill today.  I would strongly suggest that doing this is not a great idea--it did not cook all the way through and we ended up spooning it back into the tube and cooking it another 20 minutes at which time it came out looking like a lopsided mountain. (I have to disclose that marijuana use may have contributed to this outcome.)  Despite our questionable results with the bread tube, the bread actually tasted awesome.  Very lemony, moist and great with a cup of tea.  We ended up eating it all and had to make another loaf (not in a tube) this morning to take for our family meal. I will definitely be making this again.

This was great.  I had to improvise on a couple things, used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream, half white flour and half wheat flour plus added some ground flax meal and chia seeds.  I also increased the powdered sugar in the topping to about 2 Tbs after tasting it and deeming it a bit too tart for my inlaws taste.  It was very tasty and I plan to make another loaf for Xmas dinner.  Thanks for sharing!

As an empty nester, I no longer do much baking.  My husband is not big on sweets, and that leaves only me to eat what I cook.  This was perfect, less to eat, and between the blueberries and the loaf not being overly sweet, I am getting some help. I did sub fat free yogurt for the sour cream to reduce the fat content.  I used the topping as a frosting, only because I didn't read the directions far enough to realize I was supposed to use the frosting as soon as the loaf came out of the oven. This probably could have used a little more lemon flavor, I had only one small lemon on hand. Even so, it rates 5 stars with me.

I added extra lemon juice to the batter.  Next time I think I would add a bit of lemon extract.  I kept this loaf in the fridge for well over a week.  I did not find it to be soggy at all but stayed nice and moist

Dang, I crack myself up. I made a mistake and had written down 1/2 C of sour cream instead of 1/4 C - DOH! Well, my muffins still turned out great! (I opted to do muffins instead and got 12). Used Buttermilk in leiu of milk. This recipe isn't overly sweet which I prefer. I did make more of the lemon glaze but added a tsp of white sugar and boiled it so it would be more of a heavy syrup. I also generously brushed that on about 5 minutes before they were ready to pull out of the oven. Made a nice shiny (slightly tacky) tart glaze. Due to my error they were also quite moist but not gunky. A bit too heavy on blueberries for myself (didn't flour them either) so I'll go with 1 C next time. I may try same batter with chopped fresh cherries and some walnuts. Oh yeah, I used 3 T lemon juice in the batter but could have used 4 (I love lemon). My muffins took 45 minutes to bake but I know it's because of that extra sour cream. Great recipe, even when you kinda screw up! LOL

My whole family loved this recipe.  I did use buttermilk in place of regular milk, but only because I had stockpiles of butter milk leftover from the holidays.  It was still a success.  Very moist and the perfect mixture of blueberry to lemon.  This one's a keeper!

Very moist bread.  Not too sweet.  I used fresh berries from my blueberry bush!  So good.  I would probably double or triple the glaze/icing next time and use a tad more lemon zest in the bread itself.  Very nice flavor, I just prefer a little more kick from the lemon.

Super easy to make. I just made this for breakfast and it turned out amazing!
I did not have any milk so I used cream instead. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a cup of sweetened shredded coconut.
I served this with a honey sour cream drizzle and scraped in some fresh vanilla beans.

OMG!  This is exactly what I was looking for when searching for a lemon blueberry loaf.  The sour cream in the ingredients caught my attention, and the taste is outstanding.  A pretty loaf too.  I zested a whole lemone and added about a Tbl of lemon juice to the batter.  I also didn't have quite a 1/4 cup of SC, so I top it off with some yogurt.  I can hardly wait for breakfast in the morning with a cup of coffee!

If you like pastry food, not too sweet, this is really a good choice.  It was better the next day, because it was a little less crumbly.  But I really enjoyed this, and found that it went very fast in my house.  Two days and it was gone, so it was obviously well liked by the family too.

Really, really good.  As another reviewer suggested, I used the zest of two lemons because I like a lot of lemon flavor.  I will make this very often, the whole family loved it.  I might even try it with mixed berries next time.

I never rate stuff, but I just finished a slice of this bread, and it is freakin awesome! I kept the ingredients as called for, except I always add half a box or so of instant pudding mix to my sweet breads. And Idecided @ the last minute to do a streusel topping in addition to the liquid stuff you set aside (put that on first, and then the steusel about 20 minutes before it was ready). It is great though. You gave the right amounts for everything, so it is fluffy and tastes right.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I didnâ€™t have lemon but decided to make it anyway.  Lots of compliments on the flavor and how moist it was.  Not too sweet, just right.  Will make again with lemon because it will be even better.

This was a good recipe. Would have rated it higher if it tasted more lemony. I also only had fresh blueberries and used those instead of frozen. Agree with other reviewers that you need about twice as much 'topping' to pour over the loaf  after baking. Next time, I'll try using the juice and zest of two good sized lemons; adding more of each to the topping and batter, to better satisfy my lemon lust. Otherwise a nice moist  loaf that's pretty easy to make.

Very easy to make. I made the drizzle for the loaf and found it good. However, I will choose a different drizzle next time.  The loaf turned out beautifully and the flavor was perfect. I love recipes that use frozen berries. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe turned out good, but took a lot longer to bake tan stated. It was a little weird in texture, but great blueberry flavor. I will probably make this again adding more lemon. I felt the lemon got a little lost in this. I would rate this recipe a 3.5 if I could. I feel that adding more lemon will probably bring that rating up a bit. Thanks for posting.

This was a really good recipe. Could of been a little sweeter. Maybe cut back cn on the lemon juice.

I'm sure this is delicious as-is, but since I didn't feel like buying butter or sour cream, here's what I did: at a 1:1 ratio, I subbed applesauce for the butter and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Doing this actually cuts the calories without sacrificing the moistness or the yummy flavour of this loaf! I baked in a 4.5x8.5 pan because that is all I have and there is hardly a difference in size. It took about 1h10min to bake through for me. It's very sticky from the glaze and a little bit firm (I might have actually over-baked it?) and it is so good! Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper.

This didn't turn out for me. But I'd like to give it another try. I really like the combination of lemon and blueberry.

I love this recipe.  We have a local Blueberry Patch, and I think this is better than their own Lemon-Blueberry bread.  The recipe is perfect, but I really love a LOT of natural lemon flavor so I was generous on the amount of lemon juice I added to the loaf, and I doubled the amount of topping that I poured over.  I used frozen wild blueberries...It is an outstanding recipe!

Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. This is a gem. I have been making it over and over again. Only thing I changed is quantity of the lemons- I used 2 instead of 1, juice and all. My family loves strong lemony taste of it. Thank you!

I used lime instead of lemon and it turned out even better. The 2nd time I made it I left the zest out of the drizzle and enjoyed the texture more.

Yummy bread!  I got confused by the directions for the topping and added the entire amount of lemon zest and juice in the bread.  I didn't add the topping because I used all my lemon juice in the bread by accident.  It didn't matter because it still tastes good.  This bread didn't rise and it is a little dense.  I think since it doesn't rise much it would be better baked in an 8 x 4 inch loaf pan to make it taller.  Its a good recipe but may need a little something to make it fluffier for my liking.

great recipe. I only had white whole wheat flour so added a little more lemon juice to help it stay moist. It was healthy and delicious. I'm keeping this recipe!

It wasn't bad, it just wasn't everything I thought it could be. A tad lemony for my taste, though it's gone, so I don't know that anyone else was complaining!

It was good.  I think I'd add even more lemon zest or lemon extract to turn up the lemon flavor, but it was very good

Beautiful and delicious. I made mini-loaves and reduced the baking time to 30 minutes. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this again soon.

Great Bread! Everyone loved it including my house guest who doesn't like anything lemon. I would at least double or triple the sauce as it makes very little. I also made a cream cheese lemon frosting and topped it off!
