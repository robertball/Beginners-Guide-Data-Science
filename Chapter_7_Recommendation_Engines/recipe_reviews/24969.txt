I made this cake for my mom's birthday last week, and everyone enjoyed it!  My stepdad, whose birthday is this week, has requested this cake as well.  This cake goes great with Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting (also on this site).

I would never try this recipe again. The flavor was lacking and it was overly sweet.
