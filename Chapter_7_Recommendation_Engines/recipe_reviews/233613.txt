I halved this recipe but still kept the whole onion and peppers. I also couldn't find a red jalapeno, so used a green. The spice was just perfect for us and really had a great flavored soup base. Our guest don't eat spicy food at all and although they cleaned their bowls, they said it was a wee bit more spicy than they would make, but did like it. I didn't make the sour cream topping, since our guest don't really like cilantro, but it does sound good.

My boyfriend raves about his ex girlfriends chili and I've never made chili before. I had to search and search for the perfect recipe to show her up. Lol found this recipe and decided to try it. I couldn't find red peppers so I used 3 jalape√±os. I added a can of rotel chipotle tomatoes. Everything else kept the same. Took to work for chili cook off and I got tons of compliments and was told several times, best chili they ever ate including my boyfriend!  Oh...and I won the contest. I make this often now.  Best chili ever!!!

Absolutely a great recipe. I could not find a red jalapeno pepper so I used two large red chili peppers. I increased the chili powder and cumin to 3 tablespoons each because I like mine a bit more spicy. I always use Conecuh Sausage in my chili recipes so I added 3/4 pound of that, fried and cut into small pieces. I did not have fire roasted tomatoes so I used 1 can of regular Rotel instead. I could not find a Anaheim pepper so I used a Poblano pepper instead. I cooked this in my Crock Pot for 6 hours. Other than these modifications I followed the recipe as written. I considered my personal recipe to be the best out there but this one beat me hands down. It will become my new recipe from now on. Simply a blue ribbon recipe for chili.

I had to find a chili recipe for my office's chili cook off and found this recipe.  Read the reviews, especially about the one that claimed to have won their work's cook off and decided to make it.  Imagine my delight when I too won the chili cook off.  Everyone at the office raved about it.  It is hands down a winner and great tasting to boot.  I prepared all the ingredients and fried the meat and veggies the night before, placed all the ingredients in the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight.  Cooked it over four hours on high in the crockpot the following day.  The chili was nice and thick and tasty, cooked to perfection.  Great choice.

Really good recipe with good depth of flavor. Although it seemed to be missing that umami element that makes you go, "oh my gosh!" and I'm entering it into a contest tomorrow being judged by some local celebrity chefs (I'm in Nashville). 

So I decided to take it in a bit of a Sante Fe direction and added diced Hatch green chilis and a 1.5 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  Now I got the "oh my gosh!"... I'm also using Mexican crema blended with cumin and cilantro to drizzle across the top and I am deep frying thin slices of the Hatch chilis to garnish for texture.  I'm competing against 10 others so we'll see how I do!

UPDATE: I took first place! Thanks again for the recipe...

I am the primary cook in my house and cooking is kinda a hobby of mine. Needles to say my 8 kids eat well. I have been using a recipe that my mom used to make that I had tweaked over the years. But decided it was time to try something new as and found this highly rated recipe. 

When I showed this to my wife for an ingredients run she thought I was nuts trying to make what sounds like a very spicy chili. Well I made a couple of minor mods and was very pleasantly surprised. My slightly modified version will be my new go to for chili. All of my kids liked it over grandma's recipe ad did all of my employees. 16 servings gone in the first 24 hours served and lots of compliments. No one complained that it was to spicy. 

Made a 36 serving batch of this chili since I have so many  kids to feed and we like to freeze ready made meals. Since I have a variety of heat tolerances in my family I toned down the heat by only adding 1/2 of the chili powder  the recipe called for. Also omitted the tomato paste as there were several people who had gripped about it. I also added cubed steak, pork sausage and black beans. 

Next time I'll make a bigger batch :)

The tomato paste was "way to much", it over powers the other spices. My advice is to start with about 4,OZ and add to it if not delete it altogether.

Delicious.  Made exactly as directed (other than I only added 4 oz tomato paste)  To all the reviewers who modified the recipe  (other than the amount of tomato paste which must be a mistake), once you change the recipe, you are not reviewing this recipe  anymore, but your own modified take of it.  We want to know how this recipe is, not your version of it.

I made this recipe over the weekend and was very pleased with how it turned out. Very, very flavorful, just a really nice balance of all the different peppers and additions to the dish. I misread the ingredients and didn't buy enough tomato paste, so mine came out not quite as thick as the original recipe, but it definitely did not detract from its delishishness. The leftovers are even better than the first night. 

Next time I think I will make it with pork or steak or shredded beef. I would also recommend a dark beer and not the recommended coors light, or whatever. I believe I added a porter.

Very good chili!  This was a hit at my fall colours gathering. Very tasty & great spicy/sweet combo of flavours.  As  per the suggestion on reviews, I reduced the tomato paste to half a 5 ounce can, I'm wondering if the 12 oz is a typo since I've really only seen this in a small 5 + ounce format.  I also used 1 pound of pork and 1 pound of ground beef.  

I will definitely make this again.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  FINALLY; I have found THE chili recipe that I will be using from now on.   I confess...  I am a McCormick's chili seasoning person. but after this, NOT ANYMORE.     All of the seasonings, the cumin, smoked paprika, fresh garlic, chili powder, etc  are EXACTLY the flavors you want in this dish.  The smoky cumin; I also added in coriander, which really adds to that smokiness and at the same time, adds that bright taste to this recipe.   I didn't use the San Marzano tomatoes, but instead, used pureed tomatoes and the fire roasted tomatoes.  Everything else, I kept the same.  If you haven't tried this recipe yet, I encourage you to give this one a try.  This is legit and Oh, so good!

This is absolutely the best! I used two hand-minced meats: beef sirloin and center cut pork chops. I made this a three-bean chili: pinto, red kidney, and black beans. I omitted the wine and used Dortmunder Gold lager. Unbelievably wonderful!!! All other ingredients are spot-on. The flavor balance is superb.

I mixed this recipe with a three bean, sweet potato and chipotle (vegetarian) chili recipe and OMG - it was amazing!  I substituted faux ground beef, keeping it vegetarian, and everyone thought it was amazing.  Flavor was not sacrificed at all.  I'm already looking forward to making it again.   Danny's tweaks made it perfect.

I've never made chili before and made this recipe for a Poker Night of 10 guys. It was a hit!!! Didn't make the sour cream topping. Couldn't find a red jalape√±o so I used 2 green jalape√±os. As for the meat I used left over prime rib from Christmas dinner (about 3 lbs).

Just ate it for dinner tonight.  My husband loves it!

Changes:  Eliminated the tomato paste (I don't want my chili to taste like tomato soup)  Used only one can of kidney beans.  Unless you like a lot of beans in your chili, use one can.
Used a dark lager instead of light beer
Comments:  The sour cream and cilantro topping is easy and delicious.
The slight sweetness to the chili comes from the use of the 1 T of brown sugar.  If you don't want a slight sweetness, don't add the brown sugar.  The sweetness is mitigated by the sour cream topping, and the flavors all blend together well.

Will definitely make again!  Plan to use for a party

Because many of the ingredients were not staples in my pantry, this recipe ended up being very expensive to make. By the time I had purchased white wine, cumin, bullion cubes, beer, chipotle pepper sauce, etc., I was in for $40. If it had been "the best   chili" I ever tasted, it might have been worth it. It was good chili, but certainly didn't blow me away. I did make a few adjustments based on other reviews. I reduced the tomato paste to half, used one pound of ground beef and one and a half pounds of pork sausage, white beans instead of kidney beans,  and cut back a little on the chili powder, since I am not fond of chili that is overly hot. I will say that I made it for my work place chili cook off and took second place!

With the amount of tomato paste, it was very tomato-y, more than I typically like. Straightforward to make.

This was outstanding!  It is definitely on the hot  side but I loved the flavors.  I did not add the Chipotle sauce (not sure if it would have added all that much to the flavors).  I used green jalapeno chilis too as my store didn't have the red ones.

Cooking suggestions.  Saute the peppers/onion mixture in large pot which is big enough to dump the browned hamburger mixture and then tomato cans on top.  Mix the dry spices in a bowl ahead of time while both meat and peppers are cooking.  After combining and mixing the meat into the peppers and adding the tomato cans, stir in the dry spices you prepped ahead of time.  I simmered this on the stove for 3+ hours before adding the beans.  As much chili as there was, I recommend adding a third can of beans less the liquid in the can.

I made this chili recipe for a chili cook off in the office.  I am not a cook and had never made chili before so I looked for the best recipe on the internet and this popped up.  I followed the recipe as close as I could.  We went to Trader Joes, Sprouts, and Stater Brothers to get all of the ingredients.  I couldn't find crushed San Marzano tomatoes, only peeled, so I used a potato masher to crush them with the puree liquid they came with.  The kidney been cans were 15 oz. each and not 16 oz.  Could not find the chipotle pepper sauce so I used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. For wine, I used a Chardonnay Pinot Grigio.  I forgot to put the beer in while cooking the beef, so I put it in after everything was combined in the pot.  The butcher at Sprouts recommended the 80% ground beef because it has more fat in it giving a better consistency of meat taste.  Drum Roll:  I won the cook off.  It is the "Best  Chili Recipe."

I have made this several times now and I swear to God, every single time I make it I say the same thing: this is the best  chili I've ever had.  Every person who has tried it has loved it as well.

I made the recipe as directed and a few times I added some more vegetables just for personal preference. The taste is just the same really.  I don't particularly enjoy spicy food but this is just enough kick to make me keep going back bowl after bowl.

Instead of chipotle pepper sauce, I use Goya Chipotle Peppers in Adobe Sauce.  I finely chop one of the peppers and add some of the sauce to make about 1 tbls.  Since the can holds about 4 recipes worth, I froze the rest to use another time amd it worked great.

I don't bother making the topping, just because I'm lazy.  :-)  One of these days I will.

This was no different than tomato soup! Despite my initial reluctance to all the tomatoes, I followed the directions exactly. And as I suspected the tomato was way too much. 12 ounces of tomato paste! Maybe it‚Äôs a typo. Too bad because I liked all the other ingredients but they just got overtaken by the tomato. I think 1-28oz can of tomatoes and 1- 6oz can of tomato paste would be a good start. Then maybe add the 14.5 can of the fire-roasted tomatoes if needed.

This is a great "base" recipe. DO NOT USE 12oz of tomato paste... egad that has to be a typo. I used like 2 T for a doubled recipe. 

Also, be careful with the spices, I love the combination, I use all of the ones listed here and they work well, but the quantities seemed sort of strange. I halved what was called for and worked from there.

This is has become my go-to recipe for chili. I used to make "Chili By George." What makes this one stand apart is the Worcester sauce, smoked paprika, chipotle pepper sauce, and beef bullion. It adds a nice umami punch to the flavor profile.

I made a modified version - I used a recipe posted on allrecipes.com called "Darn Good chili" and this recipe in combination.

I didn't use the hot peppers called for in this recipe - but I did use crushed chili pepper flakes. I used 1 six ounce can of tomato paste rather than 12 oz called for. I also used 2 whole bell peppers, 1 can diced tomatoes (left out the crushed tomatoes), 1 fresh tomato, 1 cup salsa and 1 cup pasta sauce (I used a store bought sauce with sausage, onion and bell pepper). I did use the wine and beer and all the spices called for save for paprika.    I left out the bouillon cubes and worcestershire sauce. And I mixed ground beef as well as ground spicy italian sausage.  It is quite spicy, but I like my chili with a kick.

We thought our chili recipe was fantastic, but this is truly the best we've  ever made.  We added an extra table spoon of Chipotle Pepper sauce to increase the heat.  We really like the idea of adding the beans the last 30 minutes, this keeps them whole and not mush.  I'm not sure if this little added step will be liked by all, but we rinse our beans, the liquid, sludge they are packed in add a grainy texture and flavor we have never liked in chili!  

Awesome Chili and worth all of the prep and ingredients!

I did 5 jalape√±os instead, only 1 with the seeds. I did not add the beef bouillon cubes. 
Also instead of beef I did 1 pound ground turkey and 1 pound spicy sausage. 
I won the chili cook off at work with this recipe, against 15 other people. 
Great great recipe!!!!

Perfect blend and amount of spices and ingredients.  We used black beans.   I had smoked a brisket a few days ago and had left over meat from that.  Wow.  If you haven't tried brisket chili, consider it.  Way better than using ground beef.   
I will be keeping this chili recipe. it's a winner.

This had some unorthodox directions so I changed the order of some of the steps to suit my cooking style. Brown the beef, let it drain and cook the onions and peppers, add the beef back in and add the spices to let them roast for a minute before adding the liquid. It had nice flavor but needs to be punched up a little bit. Instead of chipotle sauce, I added a half teaspoon of chipotle chili powder as it's pretty strong. I didn't add the can of diced tomatoes and I'm glad that I didn't because the consistency of the chili was perfect. Maybe a little more chili powder and other spices next time. I use red wine, liked the beer flavor. I also only used one can of the kidney beans and that was perfect for us.

I made this chili recipe a months ago and won my chili cookoff.

I used a yuegling beer because it was all I had and the beer flavor really came through a bit too strong.
I would definitely use a beer like Budweiser next time.
Also i added an extra 1/2 lb of ground beef to make it a bit meatier.
All in all this recipe is great. Spicy without being overwhelmingly so it is satisfying to hot sauce heads like myself but also my 6 yr old can enjoy it as long as he has a glass of milk handly.

I had to chuckle as we ate this..my guy kept telling me, "this is so   good"!  I have been making chili my whole life, but just moved to New Mexico from Minnesota, so now have access to really good, fresh chili peppers.  This was just the right combination of heat and flavor.  Definately will be making this again!

We loved this recipe! I had never made chili before, so this was my first recipe/time. I really recommend it. The following are the changes I made:

My grocery store was out of Anaheim, so I substituted it for a Poblano Chile Pepper. I couldn't find red jalepeno, so I just used green jalapeno. I only used 2 lbs of ground beef vs. 2.5. If you want to make it Gluten Free use Ginger Ale in place of Light Beer. I substituted white grape juice with white wine because I don't like white wine and I didn't feel like buying 1 bottle for 1/2 cup of use. For the Chipotle Pepper Sauce, I don't know exactly if there are multiple kinds but my grocery store only had La Costena Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce. So I bought the 7oz can and poured out 1 to 1.5 tbsp of the sauce, which is all that is in the can really. I used 1 can of beans vs. 2 just because beans aren't really my jam.

I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this recipe but it was wayyyyyy to tomatoey for our liking.  Of course, I read the reviews AFTER making it and I fail to understand how somebody can give 5 stars to a recipe they had to alter and cut ingredients out of or add to.... Perhaps had I read the reviews beforehand it would have been better, but following the recipe to as written was not good.

This recipe is amazing with a couple of small changes, mainly to the directions. I always find that spices are so much better when they are cooked fully before adding to liquid, so I added the chili powder, cumin, paprika, basil, oregano, and black pepper to the meat after it was fully cooked and drained. This added such a depth to the flavor of this dish. The only other thing I changed was the white wine to red, again it gives such a richer flavor. I doubled this recipe and fed it to 18 hungry coworkers and they raved about it! This recipe is a keeper.

First time making chili and oh...my....god! It was delicious! I took the advice of many of you and used 5oz of tomato paste instead of 12oz, I used green jalape√±os instead of red, and I drained about two thirds of the grease from the ground beef. By far, the best chili I ever had! The hubby loved it too....he said it was better than his mommas and he LOVES his mommas.

Outstanding recipe!  Several ingredients I've not tried in my many years of experimentation (Smoked Paprika!).  Thanks for posting and for all the great reviews!

Agree with some of the other that the tomato is overkill.
I only used 1/2 6 oz can Tom. Paste, 24 oz Marzano & 14.5 oz fire-roasted, turned out perfect.

Here are the changes I made:  This gave it a slightly hotter kick (slightly!) and a small lift or brightness in the flavor.  All other ingredients and measures the same.

 - 3 lbs Ground Turkey with McCormick Hamburger Seasoning
 - 2 Cans Black Beans, 2 Cans Kindney Beans
 - 2 Green Jalapenos (couldn't find red)
 - +1 Orange Bell Pepper
 - 1/4 cup more Lea & Perkins
 - 1 Teaspoon Red Tobasco
 - 1 Teaspoon Cajun's Choice Blackening Spice
 - 1 extra Teaspoon Chipotle (Use Chalula!  Fantastic hot sauce!)
 -  +1 extra Garlic Clove
 
Again thanks for such a great recipe!

First time making chili -- so proud of myself! I think the beer and wine were a great touch. I added a bit of chocolate and cinnamon for extra warmth.
This was so yummy especially paired with cheese, sour cream, and Fritos.

I made this for  chilli cook off at the curling club. I am not familiar with hot peppers and did not realize that I should remove the seeds and pulp from the peppers that they contain the heat. Needless to say the chilli was very hot so I added 2 cups of cheddar cheese. I still found it hot but it was a big hit. I also made the topping and everyone loved the extra flavour. You will notice in the photo that I doubled the recipe.

I used this recipe for my chili, but made some changes that I think made it for sure the best  chili ever.  I wood fired and smoked chopped steak and kielbasi along with the hamburger for 2 hours before starting the chili.  Also I used more jalapeno and bell peppers, and didn't use the Anaheim pepper.  It was too hard to find at the grocery store here.  I also used a sweet onion and a red onion both.  In the end I threw in five slices of pepper jack cheese to the pot and mixed it until melted into the chili.  It was a fantastic addition.

This chili was awesome. I made a few modifications, I did not add the beer, wine or beef bouillon cubes (I had none). I also diced fresh tomatoes -2 cups (instead of the canned fire roasted tomatoes) and 2 large onions.  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey and I used a 15oz can of each of the following; light red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans, pinto beans and black beans (all drained).  I added 32 ounces low sodium broth (no this was not too much liquid, as it evaporated alot as it simmered) and I added a bit more salt to taste. I didn‚Äôt wait to add the beans and simmered everything for 45 mins.  I served it with a topping of plain sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. I had to restraint myself from eating more that 2 bowls, lol.

It is the best  chili!  I have made it twice with a couple minor tweaks.  I never have Anaheim chili‚Äôs on hand so extra jalape√±o it is for me.  I used 3 varieties of beans, including a big can of Bush‚Äôs Baked beans that I needed to use up.  Because I added the baked beans, I skipped the sugar.  I only had one tiny can of tomato paste so I used an additional can of fire roasted tomatoes.  My husband loved it!  He said it is my best chili ever:)

I used half of the tomato paste based on the previous comments and it was still too tomatoey. I also ended up adding a lot more of the seasonings. My suggestion would be to not use any tomato paste at all and just the crushed tomatoes. Also, I‚Äôd use half or all of the seasonings in the meat or in the peppers instead of adding to the boiled water..I think that would make it more flavorful.

SO delicious!! I only changed a couple of things, but I remember this recipe from before and a few things changed that I really liked about it so I kept them. The recipe used to call for steak sauce but they changed it to chipotle sauce, but I used bbq sauce. Also the recipe used to call for Bacon so I kept that element. definitely worth and a delicious touch. I plan on making this for my christmas party at work, there's no way anyone can say no to it!!

Meh. Not impressed. I even spruced this up with the following additions/changes:
Swapped out 1.5 lbs of the ground beef with stew meat and short ribs, 1 tbsp of cayenne, added an additional jalape√±o and a habanero (still wasn‚Äôt the least bit spicy!), cut the tomato paste in half based on other reviews (SO glad I did this) and added 5 pieces of cooked bacon.

It had a nice hearty flavor but wasn‚Äôt spicy and lacked some depth. 

Next time I‚Äôll do the same changes plus adding a couple of Serrano peppers, more salt and pepper and more chili powder.

I was very excited to try this recipe because it included so many ingredients that I like [want] in chili.  The end result was okay but the chipotle sauce was too much for me... too much smoke flavor.  I prefer my chili straight so didn't make the sour cream sauce at all.  It's a good recipe but next time I will either eliminate the chipotle sauce or  cut it way back.  Thank you for this recipe!!

If you want to eat a jar of Ragu, then you should make this recipe. WAY TOO MUCH TOMATOES. You cannot even taste any other flavor. Wasted $40 on this piece of bland, tomatoey, garbage.

This is my new go to Chili recipe. Followed the recipe as directed and loved it. Just the right amount of spice...not too hot and not too tame.  Lasted my family of 5 (1 is a 3 year old) for 3  meals...

I personally like a bit more veggies, so next time I will add some more peppers and onions.  Also, I will make a double batch to put in the freezer for a quick workday dinner night.

I think overall this was a really great recipe. I did leave out the chili sauce though, and it was lacking in things like beans- very liquidy. I left the chili sauce out because we have a bunch of kids who wouldnt have been able to take the heat. Otherwise, really good!

Instead of using all ground beef, I used 1 pound of  hot Italian sausage to add extra heat and flavor. I also omitted the can of tomato paste as I didn't want it to taste to tomato-ey. This recipe was delicious! Brought it to a work potluck and received tons of compliments. I'll definitely be making it again soon!

WAYYYY too much cumin! I wonder if it was a typo and suppose to be teaspoons not tablespoons? It ruined this dish for me and my family and wasted a lot of ingredients. I ended up having to make the whole recipe again without the cumin and mixed the two pots together.

I did not have any wine at the time I 1st made this, so I substituted it with a 2nd beer.....and viola "2 Beer, 3 Pepper Chili" was born! I can never find red jalapenos, so the green jalapenos service just as well. The depth and layers of flavor are amazing! I get raves on the yum factor!

Amazing recipe! I followed the recipe minus the white wine and only used 1 can of beans. It came out perfect and had just the right amount of heat. This was my first time making chili and I don't think I will use another recipe

Yes, I also reduced the tomato paste as suggested and I used a poblano instead of an Anaheim out of necessity. I also added red pepper flakes and cayenne. The only other change was I added a little chipotle sauce from a can of chipotle peppers. I don't love chipotle so just added a bit. Amazing

I've only made chili a few times and it was nothing to rave about. I tried this recipe and LOVED it! I hadn't read the reviews (which I usually do) and made it with 12oz of tomato paste. I also did make adjustments based on what I had on-hand: green jalapeno instead of red and chicken bouillon cubes not beef . I did swap out the light beer for a Guinness, as I've read it's a great chili compliment. I also added a large squirt of Sriracha and some cinnamon. Next time I will add more garlic and another can of beans , exclude the basil and much less tomato paste. The flavors were amazing and I've enjoyed every bite. I thought the chili had a wonderful flavor and nice spice but it was on the back end, not the  kind that burns your tongue. I made the sour cream topping and it's a really wonderful addition. Don't skip it!

Have been looking for a great chili recipe my whole life, that doesn't just taste like chili seasoning.  Found this one, figured, what the heck, any recipe that has both beer AND wine in it must be good.  I assumed the paste amount was a typo and should have read a 6-ounce can which is the only change I made.   Made it this weekend, and it turned out incredible.  Just the right amount of spice.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

This chili is amazing! Everybody loved it and raved! It is super rich and dark and earthy. I did not add the wine but added more beer and I used a non-alcoholic beer (Some people dining with us do not drink) I didn‚Äôt have the chipotle sauce so I just put in a little bit of the juice from a jar of jalape√±os, and used beef broth instead of bouillon to make up the rest of the liquid. I used to 14 ounce cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of only one, and added a little bit more of the crushed tomatoes since I accidentally opened a additional can of fire roasted tomatoes thinking they were diced :-) 
I will definitely be using this recipe again‚Ä¶ Making it into weeks for the Super Bowl!

Delicious! Accidentally added 2 Tbls Oregano instead of t but it‚Äôs still excellent. Also, added 4 small squares of German dark chocolate. Perfect! Highly recommend this one!

First off, I have always hated chili. However, we were hosting friends for football and my husband wanted chili, so I chose this recipe. 
It made a huge amount, and all of it was gone in about 30 minutes. I even ate two bowls!
The only change I made was to brown the beef in the same pot with the chilis and onions so it would absorb all of the flavor. I was afraid it would be fiery hot, with all of those chilis and chili powder, but it wasn‚Äôt at all. 
Great job developing this recipe Danny!

I really wanted to like this one. Especially after seeing the video it looked great. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see enough of the reviews to cut back on the tomato paste and that was all I was able to taste. I definitely suggest cutting way back on the tomato paste  ( maybe 4oz but maybe even less) and adding more salt to your taste. I made the recipe to the tee but it was very bland and was really overpowered by the tomato paste. 
With everything involved in making this recipe I likely won‚Äôt make it again, if anyone has any other great chili recipe recommendations please let me know!

I liked the medley of chilies and peppers, but too sweet for my taste and not just from the added sugar.  I love chili but had to bury bunches of crackers in this batch to be able to disguise the sweet tomatoey taste to finish the batch off.  Not even close to the best  chili in my opinion.

Love the twist on this chili!  Smokey, flavorful, and great texture.  We had to make some slight modifications for a few ingredients, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.  Not one ingredient was the star. It was just yummy!  Topped with  a little shredded cheddar, jalape√±o, cilantro , and sour cream.  Seconds were required! Thank you!

Absolutely loved it!!! Partner said she never had better chili in her entire life. Modifications included: similar to others, reduced tomato paste to small can from 12oz, added 1 T of cocoa powder, doubled up on bouillon (did not use any beer) with Massel gf bouillon seasoning (4t), used more meat at 3 1/2 pounds including 1 1/2 of mild Italian sausage/2 pounds of ground beef and slightly less of the hot peppers.

I couldn‚Äôt get a red Jalape√±o or Anaheim so I substituted normal jalape√±o and poblano, and substituted chicken broth for beer and left out the wine. It was fantastic! Definitely want to make it again in the future.

This recipe is great! It was a huge hit with my husband and is spicy without going overboard. We liked the sour cream too. I used 2 green jalapenos (couldn't find red) and only 6oz of tomato paste (per other reviews).

Here's my variation- improvement to my and friends taste:
1)  Use ground elk inst. of beef
2)  Soaked and cooked fresh beans, 3-4 multicolor varieties, like chocolate and Anasazi
3)  Used thyme and a bit of sage inst. of oregano
4)  Used 2 sweet onions and 6 garlics
5)  Can add a bit of sherry to white wine
6)  Can use stout inst of light beer
7)  Used a lot more olive oil for elk and veggies
8) Used a bit more chili powder and curry

Elk chili rocks, but either way this is my go to chili recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I‚Äôve never had chili this flavorful. Didn‚Äôt use the bell peppers, and just used two jalape√±os vs the poblano and red jalape√±os. Added a couple sliced serranos, and a small can of diced peppers. Used 1 lb beef and 1 lb ground turkey, couldn‚Äôt even tell since the beef broth gives the beef flavor. Personally I liked the tomato factor and will use two cans of paste next time too. Kiddo said she wants this at least once a month from now on!

I made this chili exactly as it was written. It was fantastic and not too spicy, so that everybody In my family  can eat it. (I will alter some for my own my spicy taste.).The consistency was nice, not too soupy. The great thing about chili is that you can make some substitutions based on what you have on hand or what you are in the mood for.I will save this recipe and I will definitely  recommend it to others.

Would not make again. IMO there are a quite a few simpler recipes that are better. Not that this was bad but it certainly was not the Best D Chili.  Nobody disliked it, but nobody really loved it either.

I am not a lover of spicy foods, so I didn't  use fresh peppers, but used half of a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and instead of tomato paste I added a small can of rotel  tomatoes with green chilies. This is one of the nest stating chilis I ever had. Will make again.

This chili recipe is perfected. Ive brought it to work and my coworkers rave on about it days after they have eaten it. I have given this recipe to many people. I like mine with more heat so I use 2 serranos substituting jalapenos.  I delete the brown sugar. Tomato paste has enough sugar  in it to sweeten it. Perfect flavor.

I'm not a huge fan of Chili but decided to make it for my husband.  I thought it would be super hot with all the peppers and pepper sauce but it's not.  It's fantastic.  Super flavorful with not a lot of heat.  Definitely a winner and definitely something I will make again.

It really is one of the best chilis I have eaten.  I modified by adding pork chops and beef rump roast (No ground beef) cut into cubes the same size and omitted the beans at my wife‚Äôs request.  Crushed tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl, topped with shredded sharp cheddar, sliced green onions, and sour cream.  Served it to the in-laws.  Wayne, a careful eater and fitness-focused, went back for seconds.

The recipe was fabulous, but it was a little too spicy for some of my family members. I also used diced beef instead of ground, and sweet yellow onion instead of yellow or white. I'll make it again for a chili cookoff contest on the 24th but will likely cut back on the amount of jalapenos (1.5 vs. 2)added.

Made it with red wine instead of white white, IPA instead of light beer, and just fresh green jalape√±os instead of Aneheim and red jalape√±o.  Topped it with fresh cilantro,  fresh jalape√±os, and avocado. Pretty  good!

I didn't add all the tom paste it was just too much, also I think it has too much cumin, but that is for personal taste. It has great flavor. I was shocked with adding beer and white wine to chili but had to try it.... I'll never go back.

The name says it all! I did make two changes. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I  made this in my Instant Pot (pressure cooker) to include browning  my ground turkey which means I only used one pot! I used the beans setting and then simply did the quick release. It was DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing your recipe. This is how I‚Äôm making Chili  from now on! I‚Äôll bet it would be good to make in a slow cooker as well.

I kind of did my own thing and followed the ingredients and directions loosely, but this chili was awesome. Especially the use of bullion and beer gave it a lot of flavour.  Will definitely make this again.

Best  Chili is right!  SO Good. We like spice in our home, but we don't like peppers....I know, oxymoron....but even though I was nervous using all the various peppers it called for, I did it just as the recipe called for.  They add flavor without tasting  distinctly like a jalape√±o, or bell pepper....perfect! My own recommendations or changes I made really only had to do with the seasonings. I added more cumin, paprika, and I added just a light sprinkle of cayenne to it for a little added kick.  It was not overly spicy at all,  but it helped to counter the tang of the tomatoes and had deep, rich flavor.  I used 1/2 can of tomato paste but still think I could use a little less to cut some of the tangyness.  Also, I recommend making this a day ahead (if you can resist eating it the same day cuz it so good!) and let the flavors come together overnight in the fridge.i cooked it for close to 5 hours in a slow cooker and  It was SO good when I made it but the next day, after it had time to settle, it was even better!!!! We served it with a garden salad on the side and corn bread. This is a keeper!! I can see why it‚Äôs won so many awards and why it‚Äôs called the Best  Chili!!!

I stuck pretty close to the recipe, just cutting back on some of the really spicy ingredients to cut down on the heat. I also only used about 4 oz of tomato paste and a more stout beer, per some reviewers recommendations. I feel this was a mistake as it had a strange aftertaste. Next time I will use the light beer suggested by the recipe. Overall very good and I will make it again, just have to tweak it a little for my taste.

Just made this with my wife.  Substituted a poblano pepper for the Anaheim (wasn‚Äôt available at Whole Foods).  Also used 1lb diced chuck roast and the rest as ground meat (gives more texture) and a pack of bacon. Doubled up on the chipotle sauce, because we like it extra hot. It was absolutely amazing.  10/10

love this recipe. I've made it multiple times, only with slight modifications, pablano pepper for anaheim, only because I couldn't find one, and I use what ever beer I have on hand, IPA or Corona. I've switched up the meat as well, tried venison once and the last batch was 50% beef and 50% spicy italian sausage. I've won my work's chili cook off twice.

Pretty good chili. The best part is that it is such low calorie! Very filling for the calorie amount. Lots of fiber. We changed the beef to turkey.

Have to admit this is one of the best chili recipes I have tried, the amount of spices are perfect and I followed everything to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù except for adding two cans of kidney beans, I only used 1. The consistency, flavor and spice was perfect.

This was so incredibly good and I don't like chili very much, but my husband does. I used a pound of ground pork and a pound of ground sirloin because that's what I had. We like onion so I added 2 onions. I used red chili flakes instead of chipotle pepper sauce.  I forgot the basil and I LOVE basil so that was a bummer but I did add a lot of oregano. Bullion cubes are horrible for you so I just added some organic bone broth instead. My husband like thick chili so I held back here and there on the liquids but ended up adding all the beer and wine.  I too could not find red jalape√±o so I used green. The flavor was amazing. and we also loved the sour cream mixture on top. I almost gave this 5 stars (which I rarely do). But it's probably because I don't like beans very much but still added them. This will now be my go to chili recipe.

Man, this truly is the best  chili!! Family loved it. Went back for more! I‚Äôve been searching for the perfect chili recipe. I‚Äôm done with my search. I added mushrooms. Used 2 pounds ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork. Couldn‚Äôt find red jalape√±os so used green. Subbed diced tomatoes for rotel. Everything I followed.

This really is the best  chili I ever made
I followed recipe exactly 

I‚Äôm made this recipe time and time again for several different guest each time I get asked for the recipe 
Pair it with some corn bread or tortilla chips. Yum! 
I don‚Äôt freeze food normally but even with the beans it freezes well

Recipe needs to be a little clearer when it comes to draining the kidney beans and the fat from the meat. My chili came out a little watery

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed it to the tee with an addition of 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon as one other commenter mentioned below. The flavors were complex and delicious. I used Negra Modelo for the beer. Coors Light is forbidden in my house. Will definitely make this again, best  chili indeed!

This chilli was very good! I put all the seeds in with both jalape√±os. Since the recipe didn‚Äôt specify seeds or not, I didn‚Äôt add the chipotle pepper sauce in case it would make it too spicy. Also, I wanted to be sure my toddler could eat it. I also used a full 28oz can of diced tomatoes (instead of the 14oz the recipe called for. I had a large tin on hand and didn‚Äôt want to fuss with storing a half can. It looked like the pot could handle the full tin once everything else was in. I would definitely make this again.

I have been making this recipe for years and I‚Äôve always got high compliments!   I do a couple of twists though.  I usually don‚Äôt have white wine so I put in tomato sauce and I double the beens because I like a lot of beans in my chili.  If I‚Äôm not using turkey I‚Äôll throw in some thin steak to make it even more meatier.   I‚Äôm also heavy on the spices but I love this awesome recipe.

Used turkey instead of beef. Made it with Italian bread on the side. Took out a one of the seasonings and added .5 LB of meat. Came out great.

Legit THE BEST  CHILI EVER! made a few changes, listened to other reviews and halved the tomato paste (great decision!) also subbed the chipotle sauce for half tbsp of chipotle powder and cut out the brown sugar and subbed it with my secret chili weapon (half a Hershey Bar) it so balanced, Smokey, slightly sweet and has a nice subtle heat at the finish. This will absolutely be my new ‚Äúgo to‚Äù recipe

Great recipe!! We like it a little hotter so added a small piece of ghost pepper from my garden. You can also add your favourite hot sauce when it‚Äôs done so totally a personal preference. The flavour of this chilli was a winner for sure!

This is the absolute BEST CHILI I have ever had.  There is  a little bit of prep work involved but if you follow the recipe, several hours later you have the "Best  Chili" you've ever had in your life.   We make in large batches (adjusting ingredients accordingly) and freeze it for later.  The flavors in this recipe are amazing.  IMO, it truly is the "Best  Chili"!

Best chili on this site. Easiest to modify to your taste. The tomato paste is an error- meant to say one can of 4-6 oz. Otherwise fantastic.

I thought this was pretty good, my wife thought it tasted "tangy." For the Chipotle sauce, I put a can of Chipotles in Adobo sauce in the food processor and used a Tablespoon of that. If I was going to make this again, I would half the amount of tomato paste, that would probably make it 4 stars.

let me tell you - this chili is the best chili I HAVE EVER HAD OR MADE!!!! the best  chili for sure.... 

The only changes I made was I used a green jalape√±o pepper because I couldn't find a red one. 

And because I read tons of reviews first I only used a small can of tomato paste instead of a 12oz can. 

BUT THIS CHILI IS DELICOUS!!!!!!!! 
try it - you won't regret it

I made this twice. With different meats. First time was well received. Everyone loved it. The second time I took some liberties and made this with chorizo and some home ground chicken. This was also very good but obviously much different. I will make chili again most likely with this recipe with of course some adjustments for my own tastes. Well done Danny. This a little more than 4 stars.

I used small red beans cooked in a pressure cooker. 
The rest was done in a Dutch Oven. 
And...  is it tasty!
I will definitely be making this again.

A great chili recipe that is flavorful & not overly spicy.  We only made 1 minor adjustment but mostly stuck to the recipe as written.  Will definitely be included in our recipe cycle.

I used 4 Serrano chilis instead of the jalapenos and removed seeds. This chili was not too spicy, and it was very good! This will be my go-to chili recipe from now on.

This was fantastic! Only thing I did was pull out some of the liquid and whisk in 2 Tbs of flour to thicken a bit. THis will be my new go-to chili

If I we were the only one eating this I would have used all the hot ingredients as its written but others in my family can't handle it.  So other than eliminate some of the heat , I substituted half of the ground beef with eye of round steak that I seared in cocoa rub and then cubed into bite sized pieces. It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

This is a very good chili with just enough sweetness and depth of flavor. I did cut the tomato paste down to 7 ounces as 12 ounces seemed like too much and that seemed to work well. I will definitely make this again.

The layers of flavor in this are wonderful! Couldn't find red jalapenos or Anaheim peppers, so used 4 green jalapenos. Everything else was per the recipe. I would have liked a little more heat, but we loved it, and will definitely make again. Hubby said it tasted a little like BBQ, which was probably from all the smoked/chipotle ingredients.

Did not have Anaheim chile paper or jalape√±o pepper so instead used jar jalape√±os, chopped. I also doubled the pepper sauce, used 3 pounds of meat  instead of 2 1/2 pounds, and omitted the white wine. 

I also let it simmer a few extra hours and topped with mild cheddar cheese, raw onions, and regular sour cream! 

It was beyond perfect!

*Vegetarian option, keep reading*

I've made this at least a dozen times, with no alterations. Literally every single person I have served it to has told me it's the best chili they've ever had. No lie. I also tweaked it into a vegetarian chili. Just replace the beef with four medium sized sweet potatoes, sub the beef bouillon cubes with vegetable base, and omit the worcestershire sauce. I also replace the kidney beans with black beans (just a personal preference). 

*Picture is my vegetarian option*

The Best  Chili! If your hesitant on making this...DON'T BE! I didn't have certain ingredients like all the peppers and I didn't add the chipotle sauce.  You can add or take away as you like on some things.  Do try to stay with the whole recipe though. This is by far the best Chili I've ever had....besides my momma's cili.

Great! Best Chili Recipe! I used 24 oz Coors Banquet instead of 12 oz. The 1/2 cup white wine was ecco domani pinot grigio. Paste was regular Hunts. Name brands mentioned for the tomatoes. of course I drained the ground beef before adding Worcestershire sauce and I also rinsed the red kidney beans.

I was just looking for a base chili recipe and this one was close enough. Added plain tomato sauce in place of beer and wine. Sauteed the spices with the bell peppers and onion. Browned and drained the ground beef with the Worcestershire, bullion and garlic powder. Used rehydrated pinto beans instead of canned or kidney beans. Omitted salt because of the Worcestershire sauce and bullion cubes. I don't have jalapenos on hand right now but the amount of spices (plus how i added them in), the chili is actually spicy enough without jalapenos. I suppose the only things I kept the same were the amount of diced tomatoes and the spice measurements. Oops. My adjustments are 5-star to me, but can't say much about the original recipe.

Yum!! I would reduce the worcestershire sauce, throw in a few cayenne flecks and a smidge more cumin. I use dark stout in my chile instead of wine. But these spice proportions are right on - daughter hates hot, son loves hot and I sit in the middle which is where this lands.

My 9 year old, who has decided to be a pickier eater which isn't allowed in our home, absolutely loved this chili. In fact when he saw me about to eat the last bit, which I had saved back since I only got one bowl, he excitedly asked for some. What loving mom would deny him??  We've made this a few times. The first time was last year when my non-kitchen type of guy decided to enter our church's chili contest,  found this recipe, made it, and won.  We normally used about 2/3  lean ground beef and the rest ground pork. Hubby also doesn't care for much if any beans in his chili, and it works well with or without them.  This last time I made a more than double batch for our family New Years party. The store was completely out of chili peppers of any kind, so I substituted Great Value (Wal-Mart brand) Salsa Style Fire Roasted Tomatoes in addition to the other cans of tomatoes. I also used a rinsed and drained can of black beans this time.  Everyone loved it, asked for the recipe, and took some home. Should have tripled the recipe! I don't like saying the full name, but it is goooood chili!

I didn't have any red jalapenos so I used green. That's the only modification I made. The chili came out tasty but next time I might make some more modifications.

I made the recipe exactly as written - except for using dried chili pepper because I could not find fresh.  Although I liked the chili, my family did not.  And, I thought it had an odd fruity flavor.  
So I now have a lot of chili left over that I've frozen for work lunches..
The suggestions my family had were to leave out the brown sugar and use more chili powder.

I loved this recipe. My new favorite chili recipe EVER. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the tomato paste per the other reviewers comments.  I also only used a little over a pound of ground beef because I'm not a huge meat eater and it turned out great. I left all of the seeds from the peppers and it was flavorful and spicy like I like it. Great recipe!

I have made this chilli probably 10 times now. Everyone loves it. The only changes I make, is I add extra peppers. I usually will add habenero peppers as I like it spicy. I also usually use 1 1/2 LB ground beef, and 1 lb ground hot sausage. I have also used venison in it as well. All are fantastic.

As the name suggests, this is the best  chili....with a few tweaks. As the recipe stand, this chili will NOT be spicy, unless you happen to get lucky and pick the hottest jalepenos in the store. If you like spicy chili, I would suggest adding additional jalepenos or maybe a serrano pepper or 2. We wanted our kid to eat this, so I kept the recipe mostly the same and added crush red pepper flakes to my bowl when it was done. I also subbed apple juice for the white wine (equal parts). This was not intentional, but I thought that we had white wine and I got home and we didn't. I also added 2 table spoons of white sugar at the end when I added the kidney beans. Everything else stayed the same. Will be making this again, for sure.

Always looking for the perfect chili and I think this is IT!  Made it Friday and we‚Äôve eaten it for supper for three days without getting tired of it. My husband said it was the best I ever made! Only change was 2 pounds of burger not 2 1/2.  Sooooo good!

I have made this 2 times now. Absolutely amazing! It is a monumental list of ingredients and a lot of steps, but if you measure everything out beforehand and separate it's not that bad. The house smells fantastic. I followed the recipe to the T each time. Well, I had to use green jalapeno instead of red because we couldn't find red. I can't wait to fees this recipe to more people lol.

First chili I ever made and we were so disappointed. The amount of chili paste is ridiculous so I questioned it but put it anyway and I so regret it. I love tomatoes and anything tomato based but this tastes like straight up spicy ketchup with ground beef and comino. No bueno from South Texas. ????

It's good chili.  I followed the recipe as I hadn't made it before. 
Next time I plan to kick up the heat a little by adding some more peppers and reducing the cumin a little. (I'm not a huge fan of cumin)

Those chili is very sweet. Next time I will omit the tomato paste and add 2 cans of either fire roasted diced tomatoes or Rotel. I also did 1# of ground beef and 1 1/2# of diced sirloin.  The flavor is very good though.

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews.   The list of ingredients was a lot longer than I liked but I wanted to try something new.  After reading the reviews the only change I made was adding half the tomato paste., figuring if I wanted to add the rest later I could.  I'm glad I didn't.  I expected more from this recipe.  Seriously disappointed.  My foodie teenager wasn't sold on it either.

Wowwwwww! This is hands down one of the best chili‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever made, if you want to make it spicy just add an entire 7 oz can of chipotle sauce. Also I used half of the crushed San Marzano tomatoes and 3 beef bouillon instead of 2 because I used turkey meat.

This chili has an wonderful, deep flavor.  It's not very spicy.  Due to my wife not liking a lot of heat, I only used 1 tablespoon of chili powder. So the full amount in the recipe may add a bit more heat.

I used Better than Bouillon boiled in a cup of water  in place of the cubes and beer.  I also omitted the white wine since I didn't have any on hand.

5 stars, best chili I've ever made.

This chili was incredible. I used a dark beer instead of a light beer as well as a doubling of the chipotle sauce. I prefer thicker chili so I added an extra 1/2 of beef and can of beans as well. I would say the heat was in the mild-medium range.  Can't wait to make it again for friends.

The only thing I would change would be the amount of brown sugar: I'd go with 1/2 a tablespoon (if any). I don't like it too sweet. BUT this is really good chili, will definitely will be making it again!

This is absolutely delicious with only one change: reduced tomato paste by half.  My husband is a Texan; he thinks this is the best chili he has ever tasted! The flavors meld together perfectly to provide a chili just hot enough. And the seasoned sour cream is a nice touch. Serve over southern cornbread for an excellent meal.

We do not like super spicy, so eliminated all peppers but the red bell pepper. I also substituted regular paprika and added some drops of liquid smoke. Otherwise, followed as written and finished slow cooking in Dutch oven over campfire. Big hit!! Everyone loved it!

The three of us love chili and have been looking for the perfect recipe!
This one is perfectly sweet and spicy, and has wonderful combination of flavors.
We'll definitely make this one a lot in the future

I substituted beef bone broth for the wine, everything else I did exactly as the recipe called for. The beer that I had on hand was an amber bock.  This is absolutely delicious chili!!!!

Great recipe! I love the smokey flavor so I double the smoked paprika and chipotle sauce (I use Tabasco chipotle). I also use two cans of diced tomatoes instead of one. I've made this about a dozen times and everyone loves it.

Chili was amazing although I agree with others and will cut the tomato paste in 1/2 next time.  I also doubled the beans using both dark red and white.  It was delicious

Dude, best chili I have had handsdown.  I used two pablano peppers instead of the Anaheim and omitted the jalapenos. I also used fire roasted chili's instead of the tomatoes. I added onion sea salt to the cilantro sour cream. So good!

I backed off the tomato paste...as a rule, I think it overpowers a dish.  I used 3 oz and still a bit strong.  Everything else was as the recipe called for.  At the end I felt like it needed something so I spooned out 2 dishes and added cinnamon to one and Tony Cacheres to the other....the cinnamon did nothing for me but the Tony Cacheres made it go from good to awesome (for my tastebuds!). It will be my only chili recipe!!  In the end I added 1 tablespoon of Cacheres....

A little too sweet and not spicy enough for this hot pepper hound, but that can be remedied.  Still, a feast for the chili-lovers.

My family, who are not chili lovers, devoured this chili.  Best chili I ever had.  The only peppers I added were the  diced chili pepper since it was all I had on hand.  Also, I only added a 4 oz can of tomato paste.  This is being added to our family cookbook.

This really is the best  chili recipe and ‚Äúthe‚Äù go-to for anytime we crave this comfort dish. The recipe is excellent as is. Lately, I‚Äôve been swapping out a can of kidney beans for sweet corn kernels and it adds a little sweetness and texture‚Äîcan‚Äôt beat spicy sweet! And, in case you‚Äôre wondering about the serving size measurement, there are 16 cups total. If you‚Äôre using 3 lbs of lean ground beef, total calories are 6,500, or ~406 cals per cup. If you use 3 lbs ground turkey, it‚Äôs 5,500 total calories, or ~344 cals per cup. That doesn‚Äôt include the sour cream topping.

Great recipe! Made it on the slow cooker and turned out perfect! I made a couple of modifications. I used 2 pounds of ground beef + 1 pound of mild Italian sausage. Did not add Anaheim chile pepper. Also, I added a extra tablespoon of brown sugar because it was too spicy for me.

I won my chili cook off at work with this starting recipe.  I added venison, and Neeses Sausage, coco powder, cilantro, and just kept playing with it. 

And the sour cream sauce i added lime juice that made it excellent.

This chili was absolutely amazing! I was unsuccessful when it came to finding two red jalapeno peppers, so I went with two green, still turned out 10/10. Also, I took the advice from others and did NOT add the can of tomato paste. I also couldn't find a chile pepper, so that was also something I did not add. My husband was drooling over all of the flavor. Other than the stuff I listed above, I followed the recipe to a T. This is now my forever chili recipe. Also, please know this is not spicy, just the right amount of flavor! Enjoy! Can't wait to make it again.

I agree with the other reviews. This is now my go to Chili Recipe. I made some changes based on reviews on I read.  I browned the  meat first, used regular diced tomatoes, couldn't find red jalape√±o so, I used green ones, I used the spices to our taste, and put it in the slow cooker on high for 4hours.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this chili for a local cook off and took first place out of 7 contestants.
My tweak to the chilli was this...
- 3 lbs of Tripple mix
- 2 cans of fire roasted Rotel Tomatoes.
- 2 cans of Hot Rotel Tomotoes.
- 1 bottle of Guinness beer.
- 3 sweet bell peppers ( red, yellow, green)
- 3 green jalape√±o peppers.
- 2 Medium Yellow Onions.

I did not use any tomato paste.

Very flavorful and had a distinct taste and aroma.

This is truly the best chili EVER.  Only change was to use 5 oz of tomato paste.  My family raved about this and it is hands down the best chili I've had and I love chili.  So good my daughter asked that I make this for her Super Bowl party - so making it again!!! Yum!!

First I must state for the record that I only added ONE ingredient towards the end for my husband's palate.  I am rating this recipe based on the ORIGINAL recipe that I was tasting all along during the cooking process BEFORE I added the  (2) 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.

If I ever have to make chili for guests, THIS is the recipe I would use.  SO different from the very basic chili I've always eaten and made.  It's a keeper!  Too bad my husband just needs tomato sauce in his chili, it was superb without it.

After making some more, I'd like to say I'd halve or leave out entirely the tomato paste.

Excellent recipe! My spicy sensitive daughter said it was spicy but still ate it. The rest of the family said it could have been spicier. I used half a red pepper and half a green pepper, doubled the oregano, used regular paprika, added a can of sliced mushrooms, and used 1 can of mixed beans with 1 can of kidney beans. I found the cumin was a little overpowering. Next time I'll use 1/2 the cumin and whole red and green peppers.

Wonderful chili!  We‚Äôre weinies when it comes to a lot of heat in our chili, but we found this to be perfect.  Like others, couldn‚Äôt find red jalape√±os and had to substitute green, and I did run out of cumin, so I only used 1T instead of 2.  The only thing I left out completely was the chipotle pepper sauce, because I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was.  Researching later, found that Tabasco has a brand of this, so might try next time, or just add some chipotle chili powder, which I didn‚Äôt remember I had.  Update:  Just made this a second time.  Used only 6 Oz tomato paste ... I think I‚Äôd go back to 12 Oz next time.  Still think it‚Äôs a great chili recipe, and think we like it better than some of the other popular recipes here, which I‚Äôve also made.

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. I used one jalape√±o and removed all inside. I subbed a plablano for the Anaheim since the store doesn‚Äôt carry them. I would use 2 plablanos and also I used diced tomatoes w green chilli.

First time ever making chili and my girlfriend and best friend love it!  We all did...
I made a few changes
* added another 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* added another  1/2 envelope of beef bouillon
* substituted dried basil for dried cilantro
* added 1/2 a teaspoon of adobo
* used 8oz of tomato paste instead of 12oz

Great balance between mild and spicy :-)

Very tasty! I thought it might be really hot, but it was just right. My only suggestion would be to drain the browned hamburger. I didn‚Äôt, and the chili was a little greasy. Nevertheless, it was truly delicious. Don‚Äôt skip the sour cream topping.

Closest to a long lost family recipe I loved as a kid. Hearty and satisfying.

Some adjustments made: I did this recipe in an instant pot. Saute'd everything in step 1 there then just let the instant pot do its thing. I only used fresh garlic, one whole chopped clove. My beer was 12oz of Foster's Lager. I used Fresno peppers instead of red jalape√±o because that was what the store had. Cubed chuck instead of ground beef (it was going to be additional buy it wouldn't all fit. Instead of powdered bullion I added 1lb of  ox tail. All high pressure for 1 hour. 

The name "best  chili" is well deserved.

Made this for a neighborhood chili cook-off....and won.  The only changes I made to the recipe was skipping the white wine (because I didn't have any), I used Yuengling Light beer and had to add an addition green jalape√±o pepper so it had some kick to it..... it already had a great flavor.

The only thing I might change in the future is to cut out a little of the meat and add some more beans.

Really great recipe‚Äîlots of ingredients may appear intimidating and/or expensive, but the end result is a complex taste with the right amount of kick. (PS‚ÄîI also only used 6 oz. of the tomato paste. More than enough). And don‚Äôt forget the accompanying sour cream/cilantro/cumin sauce. It may seem optional but i had as many compliments on that as I did the chili at last night‚Äôs 15th annual chili cookoff. That I won.

This recipe really is the best  chili I've ever had. I've made it twice now and love it. The first time I left out the hot sauce because I forgot to pick some up. We actually liked it better without the hot sauce. It has a sweeter flavor, and we tend to prefer sweet to hot.

OMG! I have to say this chili was delicious. The only  change I made was cutting down on the tomatoe paste to 5 ounces as previously mentioned by other reviewers. My children loved this chili and so did I. It was so flavorful with a bit of spice and I truly enjoyed it. Thank you to the person who shared this recipe. I will  def be making again.

I want to start off by saying this is the first food review I've ever given but this recipe was so EASY and delicious that I just had to rate it....also, I'm not a good cook (mediocre at best).  Used 3 green jalapeno peppers since I couldn't find the other types of peppers the recipe called for.  I was  a little nervous about that but it still tasted great....maybe a little less kick but that's fine with me.  My husband who's a picky eater and rates everything as "ok" or "not bad" actually said this was delicious (married for 14 years and I've heard him say this only a handful of times).    I can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner again tomorrow!

Made this chili last night and it was soooo good! I left out the tomato paste, because of reviews and the fact that I didn't have any. It was pretty tomato-y without it and I'm glad it was left out. I didn't have any peppers, other than the red bell pepper, so added a can of green chilies instead. I used Franks for the pepper sauce which I also didn't have. Put 3 tbsp each of chili powder and cumin. Only had about 1.5 lbs of ground beef so added a can of black beans with the kidney beans. Didn't try the sour cream sauce. Loved it and will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as written but took note of the concerns about the tomato paste and made with half the amount. I prepared it all in two pans as written and then transferred to a crock pot. It was even better the next day. This is my new chili recipe!

Made this for a work chili cookoff and it was the first one gone! Perfect amount of heat! I used 2 lbs ground beef and 1/2 lb of hot Italian sausage.  Will definately make it again!

Perfection! People were practically weeping this chili was so good.
Small Additions: I wasn't shy with the beer. I used an amber ale and put in two bottles. I also added a chunk of dark chocolate.

This recipe was fantastic! I did make a few slight modifications based on other reviewers and it was a complete hit! First, I used only 6 ounces of tomato paste instead of 12. Even with the halved amount, I was concerned it was too tomatoey once it began simmering, but it was good at the end. I also used a darker beer, added some hatch green chilis, a chopped chipotle in adobe, and used 3 green jalape√±os instead of 2 red. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for my wife. She surprised me when she said it was the best chili she's ever had anywhere (homemade or restaurant) and she's lived in the southwest. Those are big words to say "The best I've ever had."  I lived in Texas for a few years and it was the best I've ever had but I thought I was just being partial since I made it. Either way I was surprised and it was the best I've ever made. I was pretty concerned about the amount of tomato paste but it actually wasn't an issue. I could see cutting it in half though.

I had to substitute several ingredients since they weren't available in our local midwestern grocery store. The strength of the recipe is it held up to these changes. It shows the ratios are correct and it's a solid recipe. I ended up putting the recipe with my changes in my recipe book and it is now my goto chili recipe.

My compliments to the original creator.

I also made this for a chili cook-off and won in two categories! Best overall chili and best after taste. Only changes were green jalapenos instead of red and 6 oz of tomato paste instead of 12 per another review recommendation. Great recipe! Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you off!

I used sherry wine instead if white wine, used siracha instead of red pepper sauce. Didn't have tomatoe past so used tomato and basil spaghetti sauce. Put over jasmine rice and family enjoyed it.

HOLY COW!  I am into the 2.3 hour of making this and each time I taste it, I just want to  eat it all, and while I had planned to give half of it to a neighbor...not this time!   Fabulous flavor!!!   I made exactly as written and I have not yet even attempted to add the sour cream stuff.   i am nor sure what makes it so deliciously unusual, but perhaps because I have never previously used RED jalapenos!   Thanks!!!!!

This is my favorite chili recipe. The only thing I do different is add a pound of hot ground sausage (I like my chili extra meaty),  use a 6oz can of tomato paste instead of 12oz, and add a 16oz can of tomato sauce. I also usually throw a couple chopped habaneros in to give it some heat!

Tried this recipe this past Sunday for Super Bowl.....it was a hit!! I have never made chili before so I was a bit intimidated, but it was actually very easy to make and soooooo delicious!!!! I used grass fed beef, and I did not have any wine, so I left that out, and the only beer I had was Stella Artois but it was so tasty and smelled so good while it was cooking. Great recipe! My only disappointment was that it wasn't as spicy as I was anticipating but that was an easy fix with the fresh chopped jalape√±os on top. And I actually left the Anaheim pepper whole while the chili simmered and it was so delicious on its own. I love all kinds of peppers! Overall best chili recipe I've tasted and will definitely make it again! Thanks!!

I won a chili cook off with 20 other chili's, using this recipe! I used a little over 3 pounds of beef and couldn't find red jalepenos so used green. Added a little more salt and measured sloppy on the too much side with the spices; worked out perfect with the extra meat. Bravo!

Fabulous recipe!  I did roast my peppers, then chopped and added as well as used hot sausage in addition to the ground beef.  I used a can of chili beans seasoning and a can of black beans drained and rinsed.  I think the key is putting in the beans a few hours before serving so it doesn't make the chili pasty.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!

The only change I made, was one pound of beef, and I skipped the large can of tomatoes. I think the large can of tomatoes would have made it too "tomatoey" for us. I put in a can of kidney beans, and black beans, which made it perfect.

Delicious recipe! I also couldn't find red jalape√±o so used 1 med green. We are vegetarian so I subbed soaked/cooked/drained black beans for meat. Also added a pablano pepper and followed recipe otherwise. Will definitely make again but will take suggestions of other reviews and only use 6oz tomato paste as well a darker beer than suggested!

This chili was amazing.  Really there is a lot of wiggle room as far as the ingredients.  I followed the recipe 75% or so, but improvised on small things like using a white onion instead of yellow, used 50/50 ground beef and hot italian sausage, used rotel tomatoes w/green chiles instead of fire roasted. Also, offered saltines, shredded cheddar and fritos for garnishing.  KEY PTS were beer, wine and meat types. This is truly an awesome recipe though.  Thank you for sharing it.  It will be my go-to for now on.

I used this recipe base but put my touch on it! Added a seeded green jalape√±o along with the two reds. My meat was 1 lb of cubed steak for stews, 1 lb of Angus Ground chuck, and 1 lb of hot sausage. Did three cans of beans - 1 each of black, red and chili beans. Used/did everything else as listed and added 1 tbsp of molasses, 2 tbsp of yellow mustard, 1 tbsp of ground mustard, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tbsp of onion powder and 1/2 tbsp of ancho chili powder.

I made it in a pot because our slow cooker wasn't big enough. Sadly, I burned it after I put the meat and veggies together (before the beans go in). So I had to dump it into a bowl, clean my pot and then put it all back in the pot  at a lower setting. It recovered fine!  In fact, I entered the campground chili contest and won!  YAY!  Everyone loved it!  THANK YOU!

Made w/o the tomato paste as suggested by others.  Instead, for a thicker texture I used an immersion blender to partially grind some of the soup.  This soup has great flavor.

This is a fantastic base recipe except I added quite a bit more than what the recipe called for.  For the meat I used EXPENSIVE I might add) two pounds of organic ground beef; 1 pound of bison and 1 pound of Jimmy Dean's sage sausage.  I also added my own peppers in addition to the ones listed in the recipe which were plabano and bananna peppers which both have GREAT flavor anyway....I love chili flavor so I added a lot more chili powder than the recipe called for.  (about 1/4 cup of chili seasoning...) also used more cummin then recipe called for.....4 tablespoons...and the brown sugar probably 1/4 cup .   Only used 6 oz of the tomato paste as others had suggested. I added the beans only the last hour in the crock pot on high.  Allowed the chili to cook for 3 hours on high and locked the lid to the crock pot and turned it off and allowed it to just sit over night.....it turned out very well.  We are entering it in the chili cook off at church tomorrow....will let you know how we do :)

This was great! Perfect blend of sweet and spice. I also cooked a pound of bacon, and cooked the onions/peppers/garlic in about 2 tbsp of bacon fat (instead of oil), and only added 6 oz of tomato paste.

I used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 left over smoked pork (from the freezer). I also almost doubled the amount of chili powder. It got rave reviews at a party I hosted this past weekend. Great base recipe - play with it to make it what you love!

My whole family loved this chili.  I followed the recipe with a few  exceptions.  I used my garden tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes.  I am celiac so I substituted red wine for half of the beer and used water for the other half.  I did use the white wine as the recipe directed.  I added an extra garden jalapeno too.  I cut the ground beef and added sweet Italian sausage for the missing half. I did not make the cilantro sour cream, but offered toppings of sliced green onions, grated cheese, sour cream, diced jalapenos, and chopped cilantro.   It was a big hit and loved by everyone - we had about 12 guests.  I am delighted Danny Jaye posted this recipe.  THANK YOU!!!

Made this chili with tomatoes and jalape√±os fresh from my garden. I added more beans and a little more variety besides just the kidney beans. It tasted delicious!! Will be making this again but this batch I'm sure will last me awhile. I'll be freezing and packing for lunches or dinners.

I am always looking for a chili that has a bunch of fresh ingredients and something my daughter will like.  She says she hates chili and I am out to prove her wrong and find a recipe she likes.  Challenge excepted!  I made this recipe with just a few revisions.  There is only 4 of us so I cut the ingredients in half, I omitted the worcestershire sauce and white wine and substituted 6oz of tomato sauced and added a half a bottle of light beer.  I enjoyed the other half :)  I told her that was the only way she was getting alcohol :) I kept tthe rest of the recipe the same.  Final Result:  My 17 year old daughter loved it!!!!  Mission Accomplished.

Let me start by first off saying, I normally do not leave reviews. However; in this case, I MUST. I would also like to think that I know how to make Chili as it was a tradition in my household growing up sitting in the house on a cold evening after chopping some wood behind the wood shed next to the Johnny house in Virginia. 

   But, everything that I thought I knew, was completely wrong, well mostly. We had a Chili Cook-Off here in Colorado yesterday and I was looking for ways to make my Chili a little differently, better, doubtful, lol (A little self fluff). 

   While I was perusing the internet, I stumbled on this recipe. I am not sure if it was the picture or the bold statement, Best  Chili, that caught my eye. But none the less, it did. That is a serious claim, I mean, who wouldn't stop by to check it out.

   As I was looking at the ingredient list and was thinking, there is NO WAY that would work in chili. Some ingredients I despise by themselves, a.k.a.- beer. (I am a Whiskey Man myself).  Then I thought, how can I get better if I am closed minded. ( I mean, who would have thought mayonnaise works in cake? and imagine my surprise when I seen people dip their fries in it, mayonnaise, really?) Could be because I am from the south, who knows really.   

   SO.... Here began my journey into the unknown, using spices I normally would not, ingredients that ideally would not belong, Worcestershire  sauce, beer, wine? (kinda sounds like the start of a fun night!) the list g

This was really good but just needed just a bit more seasoning to me, something was just missing. I didn't add the seeds because my husband doesn't like it hot so maybe that's why but other wise a very good recipe.

I fried the ground beef with some (nowhere near what it called for) Worcestershire sauce and a little garlic powder . Set that aside. In a pot, I added: 3 cans pinto beans, 15 oz tomato sauce, 4 diced tomatoes, 1 diced onion, 6 anaheim peppers and 4 jalapeno peppers (all peppers were de-seeded and diced), 2 stalks diced celery,  1/2 cup white wine, 4 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp chipolte pepper sauce, 2 tsp dried basil, 2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp pepper. I didn't add the beer, olive oil, fresh garlic, or the brown sugar. After simmering for 25 mins, I added the cooked ground beef to the pot and cooked until done.

This is a pretty solid chili recipe that all will enjoy. I like it a little spicy,  but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I didn't have chili sauce, so i used a tablespoon of  red chili salsa. I also used a yuengling instead of a light beer. I put a small bowl aside before adding beans for my wife and daughter since they don't like beans in chili.  I will bring half to work to share with the guys. Thanks for posting this recipe!

My new favorite chili recipe!  The first time I made this, my husband kept saying how awesome it was. He literally called it " the best  chili " he had ever eaten. He kept asking me what it was called and I couldn't remember. So at the dinner table, I grabbed my phone to pull up the recipe and said " you are not going to believe this --but it's called The Best  Chili".  I had to show him my phone to prove it! LOL.  We both agree that it's properly named! 
My only adjustments were - I left out some of the hot ingredients or minimized them a bit b/c we have 2 small children.

A year ago we had a chili cook off at work.  I'd never made Chili before so I decided to search for a receipe and give it a shot.  I came across this one quickly, it was the first search result.  After reading a couple reviews about how people won their chili cook off I decided this was the one.  I'm the 2 year reigning chili cook off champion at work now!

Way too much tomato paste. You would think the brown sugar would help with the acid from the tomato paste, it just makes the chili sweet. I feel like I threw away my money making this recipe.

I made this for a work Chili competition and it won.  It was even more impressive as it was the first time that I had ever made chili.  Great recipe.  I will say that I tweaked it a bit.  I tried a little of the smoked paprika and didn't like how it affected the taste so I omitted it.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of cayenne pepper sauce (Trappeys or Lousiana would be my picks rather than Tabasco).  I will definitely make this again.

Gave this recipe a try even though I was alittle worried by the number of ingredients I had to round up. But boy am I so glad I did! My family loved it! It has such a smooth mellow smokey taste,. It wasn't one of those Chilis that bite back at you and then you have heartburn for hours later. This is def a winner! I never worked with chipotles before, now I am a believer!

The first time I made this recipe, I really liked it.  The second I made it, I made it for a chili cook off.   Since I wasn't worried about keeping it healthy, I used a bit fattier beef.  I also added more garlic and jalapenos.  I used a food processor to chop the vegetables and ended up with a finer chop than I intended.  Still, I won third place out of 20 entries!

I made this today for a chili cook off & won 1st place (there were 5 chilis total). I replaced the beer with 1/3 c marsala wine & I replaced the smoked paprika with 2T of liquid smoke. I also added 1 lb extra of the beef. I topped the chili with shredded mozarella cheese & cilantro sour cream I made.

My co workers have been asking for this chili again for weeks. I kept most everything the same besides subbing our home grown peppers and not using tomato paste. This will be my go-to chili for sure.

This is the "BEST  CHILI" my family and I have ever had.  The only adjustment I did to the chili was.  I mix all of the dried spices together in a coffee grinder.  And added the dry spice mixture to taste.  Once I did that.  It turned out to be "THE BEST  CHILI' we have ever had..

Really, really good! I made adjustments based on what I had at home and cooked it in the crockpot on high for 3 hours.  Will definitely make again. changed to: two green bell peppers, no chipotle sauce, no chiles, hot salsa instead of fire roasted tomatoes, pinto and kidney bean mix, regulag paprika, no sugar, a good ale, soy sauce instead of Worchestershire sauce.

It was quite labor intensive and the flavor was good, not great!  Not worth the effort.  Too much tomato flavor, if I were to make it again, I'd cut the tomato paste in half.

I veganized this using Gardein Meatless meatballs (two packages), crumbled.  I served it to a party consisting of meat-eaters, and everyone raved!  Whether you use the lean beef, or substitute faux meat, this is hands down the best chili recipe.  The spices are perfect, the wine and beer compliment, and it has a hint of sweet heat as well.  Love it!

Great recipe. The chili was absolutely delicious. Made it the first time as the recipe explained, and the second time I made it with gluten free pale ale (that's all I had). If you're using a gluten free beer like that, I might suggest only using half or 3/4 of it and and the rest with water. The gluten-free ale dominated the flavor, but it was still wonderful.

This recipe is good, but could be very good if you leave out the tomato paste, which made it taste way too tomatoey.

This chili is absolutely awesome! I made it exactly the way the directions said and the only thing I will do differently next time is one jalape√±o instead of 2 and maybe a little less Chipotle sauce cause some of my family dont like it as hot as it came out. Other than that, this is amazing!

Great Recipe - followed seasonings precisely.  Made these small alterations.....Added the following peppers - 1 Green, 2 Cubanel & 2 Poblano  (couldn't find Anaheim) - Also doubled up on the beans & fire roasted tomatoes .  My husband has always boasted that his was the best chili ever since I met him.  This time  he was not feeling well and suggested I try to make my own.  I found this recipe and he has not stopped raving about how delicious this recipe was.  He said it beat his hands down!!!  So very happy with this recipe and the fact it is not hot spicy, rather a smokey soothing comfort dish.   Thank you!

This is an excellent chili recipe, but I did reduce the amount of tomato paste by half for our taste. It is probably still delicious as written if you like your chili very tomatoey tasting. Love all the other ingedients listed . It was yummy!

At first the ingredient list seemed a little too over-the-top (does it really need beer *and* wine?) and there are a few things I will change (it does not need both chopped garlic and garlic powder), but on the whole an excellent recipe that I am now adopting as the house standard.

Pretty dam good, If I make it again I will reduce the amount of tomato paste and make it hotter. Not to say that bowls were not licked, because they were.

I used ground bison for the meat choice. Used four cans of the Rotel diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro and will be using the tri-bean blend cans of beans. This is an excellent recipe.

I made this on Monday to check out the recipe for today's chili party. It was wonderful. Lots of complex flavors and a nice meaty taste. A really good traditional chili. I did some tweaking though...added more onion and garlic. Used one green jalape√±o, one red chili and one Serrano. Only used 1 small can of tomato paste, it def doesn't need the big can. I did not use any bullion. 
Used coors light and an organic white wine. Let it simmer in the Dutch oven for 60 mins then threw it in the crockpot for 4 hours. I'll let you know if I win!!

This recipe turned out to be delicious!! The only substitutions I made were Poblano pepper instead of Anaheim and green jalepeno instead of red due to availability.  Awesome recipe.

I made it almost identical, and added a can of button mushrooms and 6 breakfast sausages fried and cut up and mixed in... and it won 1ST PLACE at a chili cook-off this past weekend at a buddies 40th birthday bash. No kidding!!

I've made this chili many many times and every time I change it up. It's literally the best chili I've ever had and that says a lot coming from a chili award winning Dad. This time, I skipped the beer and the wine and substituted a cup of water and did half of the portion of chili powder since my husband isn't a big fan of spice and it still turned out to be the best chili I've ever had. This is also the first time I made the sour cream and it's amazing! I've been missing out!

I found this recipe looking for chili with more flavor and this delivered. It was tangy, and a little sweet but balanced out by the salt and heat perfectly. Used Sam Adams Boston lager (not a light beer but I enjoy it more and thought it might give a nice nutty flavor) and sauvignon blanc for the wine. I also tossed a chopped habanero in for a little extra heat. I didn't have brown sugar so I tossed in about a tablespoon of semi-sweet chocolate and that worked well. This is a really great chili recipe.

No changes were made besides could not find red jalapenos, so I used fresh green ones. Excellent choice of recipe. Just in time for the cool weather.

Super good.  This will be my new chili recipe from now on.  I love the cilantro sour cream.  We also topped with fresh cut onions and shredded cheese.  Served over jasmine rice which adds a nutty flavor that really enhances the dish.  Thank you for a fabulous dish.  I didn't change a thing.

This is by far the best homemade chili a novice cook could attempt with astounding results!
I made the this recipe and it came out absolutely amazing.

I did however slightly make it my own with a few minimal changes that help class it up a bit including: 

-substituting stew beef for ground beef (pound for pound)

-and as another had suggested, only using a small, 6 oz can of tomato paste, as opposed to the whole 12 oz as the recipe called for. I happened to use a basil added style however i do not feel that is necessary.

Other things that weren't quite clear in the directions were:

-with the Jalape√±os and Anaheim peppers; make sure to cut out the inner membrane and deseed them. (this will help cut out the heat from the peppers)

-I also used a "Lager" style beer (any will do) I bought a 16oz can so I was forced to drink the rest. ;-)

-I also added the juice from the cans of kidney beans as well to help add juice as well as thicken things up a bit.

-The stew beef alteration I used turned out to be a really good idea as I received a piece of beef in just about every bite! I managed this by cutting down the stew beef even more, from how the butcher trimmed it, into half inch cubes (or as close to a cube as possible)

All said and done, this recipe turned out really well. I wouldn't alter the spicing as it was perfect. The smoked paprika really stood out. Try not to skip that one.
The recipe could certainly be haved if you do not enjoy leftovers.

Mine yielded approx 4 qts

This is a great recipe. 5 stars! However, I did make a few changes. instead of 1 tablespoon of brown sugar I opted for 4 to make it a bit sweeter. I also nixed the beans altogether` because chili in Cincinnati does not have beans. I also left just a few tablespoons of grease left over from the meat in the mixture for a little added flavor. It turned out very nice!

Delicious- just the right amount of spice.  Used adobo chile powder and some additional cumin.  Added some garlic powder to the sour cream / cilatro topping.  Served with jalape√±o rings, chips and sharp cheddar.  Absolute hit!

I liked this chili and reduced the tomato paste but it was still a little to tomatoey to me. I like my chili to be a little more meaty tasting. I used newcastle because that is what i put in all my chilis and used ground turkey. Great consistency and good flavor but would probably leave out tomato paste all together next time

This was the perfect chili recipe for a cold winter weekend. My husband and I loved this and so did some of my husband's friends who got leftovers on Sunday. I made some tiny substitutions, I used Yuengling beer, my store only had green jalapenos, I only had one 6oz of tomato paste, and I didn't have pepper sauce so I used some Goya hot sauce instead. Also, I topped with sour cream, no cilantro, and fresh Havarti. We will for sure make this again!

Great recipe! Only changes I made... Only 6 oz. of tomato paste (instead of 12) and 3 cans of kidney beans.(instead of 2).
Really deep flavor and super texture... Smooth and chunky at the same time.
I would make again!

I made this recipe by the book and it came out amazing.  Hands down the "best  chili" I ever had.  I shared and it was gone immediately with everyone asking for recipe.  This was only my first go at chili and I nailed it thanks to your recipe.  It is a perfect blend of spice.  It has just enough heat for those whose enjoy spicy foods and not too much for those who can't handle them.  Thank you for recipe.

Have made this recipe three times in the past month - we Love it! Today I substituted ground turkey but prefer a lean ground beef (from butcher shop). Accompanied with a three-cheese sourdough grilled sandwich, it's a perfect winter dinner!

This is a great chili recipe!  I only made a couple of changes since I read a lot of the reviews.  I used ground turkey and didn't have bullion so added a little chicken broth.  I did not add the tomato paste, it didn't need it and didn't have chipotle sauce so chopped up a couple of chipotle peppers.  I always make a different chili recipe but really liked this one.

I tried this recipe over the week-end and used pork instead of beef
everything else was according to the recipe except I had downsized it to 6 serving rather than 12 as there are only two of us. 

I was totally unimpressed with the flavor of the of the Chili I do not know if the use of ground pork over beef entered into the taste or not.  My Husband seems to have developed a allergy to beef as each time he eats beef as of late he becomes sick so we are currently avoiding beef. But I did question some of the ingredients and the taste outcome as I was preparing this recipe. I would not make it again.

We made a half batch and had to improvise to use what we had.  Used diced tri tip, sausage and bacon for the meat; chipotle peppers, 2 cans diced tomatoes and a whole bottle of 805.  Great northern beans, 1/2 ea. red and green bellpepper, and diced canned jalapenos in place of the fresh.  Added a splash of vinegar at the end.  Really good.

This chili recipe is amazing! I wanted a more traditional recipe since I was in charge of bringing chili for 30 people. My old recipe calls for larger amounts of red wine. For the most part, I followed this recipe exactly. The only thing I changed was using ground turkey and decreasing the amount of chile/jalape√±o peppers & tomato paste. I didn't want the chili too spicy and I only had 1/2 of the tomato paste required. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 of a seeded jalape√±o pepper. I love the fire roasted tomatoes and smoked paprika. The only thing I will add next time is some green peppers for color. I will definitely be making this again:-) Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Loved this,  adjusted hot peppers to about 1/4 one.  Kept everything the same except couldn't find San Marino tomatoes so used PC brand crushed ones.  I came on here to rate my first recipe ever! Oh and used chiplote spice not sauce. Jost wine and Keith's beer

This turned out amazing. Rich in colour and bold flavour.   I halved the recipe but used the same amount of peppers and onion. Did not add beer. Used fresh herbs. Had leftovers the next day with chips and the sour cream mixture....the flavours in the chili  had really intensified. Best darn chili  ever without a doubt.
