There may be an error in the crust ingredients though, I had to double it for it to cover my pan, and yet the cheese mix fit very well.

There isn't enough crust(oreos) to cover the bottom of the pan.  I added about 8 more cookies, but no more butter.  I used gluten free Joe Joe's instead of oreos.  I loved the cream cheese part. It was smooth and creamy. I added some carmel sauce after plating the pieces and omitted the salt. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this recipe with gluten free oreos and dutch chocolate powder instead of Baker's chocolate and it was delicious.
