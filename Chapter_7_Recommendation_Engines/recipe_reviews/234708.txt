Solid 4 star recipe.  The water amount wasn't specified so I used an entire can.  I had to compensate with the liquid after cooking.  I didn't use the entire contents of the onion soup mix....nearly 3/4.  The cooking time is WAY OFF.  I put my roast into the crockpot at 10am on low.  I pulled it out at 3 and it was nicely cooked.  Anything more would have been overcooked and dry.  I pulled all of the moisture out, made a roux, and thickened the sauce to a more gravy like consistency.  I also added spices before I seared my meat and 3 celery ribs, just because they were sad and begging to be used.  I absolutely had NO complaints on the pot roast but I admit to doing some serious off recipe (not ingredient) additions.  I made a side of sauteed mushrooms with red wine and pear balsamic vinegar which was a HUGE hit to accompany the pot roast.

For those who deemed this recipe as "too greasy": if your roast has wide bands of fat around or running through it, trim the excess fat before browning the meat.  The recipe itself does not have anything to make the dish greasy.

Have made this recipe twice now, and it has replaced the way I made roasts for more than 20 years.  The first time, I made exactly as written using " Beefy Onion Soup Mix" because I keep that on hand (it's one of my Recipe Secrets for meatloaf) and it was 4.5 stars good.  The second time I made it when extended family members were visiting and I made a few minor adjustments; I used a 1-lb bag of multi-color baby potatoes (whole) and replaced the green beans with a large sliced onion and some whole ribs of celery.  I also heated the 2/3 cup water enough to dissolve 2 beef bullion cubes before adding to the soupy mixture because I accidentally bought plain onion soup instead of beefy onion.   It was delicious!  I had used the baby new potatoes simply because it was easier, and an unexpected benefit was this made the presentation much more appealing. Everyone had seconds and my niece requested the recipe so they could make it at home.

I added chopped onions. I put them on the bottom under the potatoes. I also added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with the soup mixture. We like the liquid thick. So good

I added an onion, garlic and dried chives. I also seasoned the beef before searing and used golden mushroom soup!
