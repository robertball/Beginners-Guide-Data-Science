This is THE BEST Crab Dip ever!  I've been using this recipe for the past couple of years and guests always hover around the Crock Pot, dipping their crackers and singing the praises of this yummy, yummy stuff.  Try this - you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!!!

This is one of my favorite appetizers.  There is usually never any left over and I doulble the recipe too.  I serve it w/ Club crackes.  The green onions are a must;  Regular onions are not nearly as good with it.

This is a crab dip for people who don't have access to fresh crab or those who don't like crab.  Made it with the real thing for my grandkids and served it with tortilla chips.  They ate it but complained because it wasn't my usual Chesapeake Bay style crab dip.  Good for what it is, but is definitely not crab dip by Maryland standards.

This was really good.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  Making it for only two people I reduced the recipe in half and used my fondu pot instead of a slow cooker.  Hey, it worked for me!  I highly recommend this for a large party.

This is yummy! I could have eaten it with a spoon instead of as a dip! Everyone loved it.

this was my first time trying this recipe. I wanted something different for my birthday party, and I was very sceptical about trying it. I was truly amazed on how simple the recipe was. When I set it out on the table, the guests were like WHAT IS THIS? Once they saw one person eating, then another it was gone before I knew it. This is one appetizer that I'll be using for now on. thanks

I did not like this recipe at all.

Way too much cream cheese.  That was all I could taste.

Very easy recipe to make more or less of. I scaled it down to 1/3 the servings b/c I only had one package of cream cheese.  I also realized I had Imitation Lobster flakes instead of crab, but it was still delicous.  I will definitely make this again.  Also, turns out it is very good cold as well.
