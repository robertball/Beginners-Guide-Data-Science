I tried this a long time ago but never rated it. I made this with pork and once with chicken breasts and both very good. I used frozen oj concentrate about 2 tablespoons in place of OJ. I added some dried rosemary with other herbs, I would have used fresh if I'd had it. I also used balsamic vinegar and loved the mellow flavor! Also I added 2 tbs.of cold butter to this finished sauce, I added it last by slowly whisking it in a pat at a time, it thickens the sauce and gives it that silky quality found in French cooking. Serve this over a bed of soft polenta and you have a restaurant quality dish to serve to guests!

I've made this recipe a couple times now, and it is always great!  It's important to use boneless chops though.  The sauce is perfect, and I've used both red wine and white wine vinegars.  The sauce thickens more once it's off the heat, so follow the directions, then let it sit a few minutes, and it will be perfect for serving.

My husband and I made this tonight.  We loved it.  We made two changes.  One was switching the white wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar. The second was instead of raspberry we used blackberry (since that's all we had).  We've made this recipe before with no changes and enjoyed it...We made again with these changes and LOVED it this time.

This was a fast dinner and was loved by all. I would make it for company, for sure! I grilled 6 bone-in thinner pork chops (had to make a little extra of the rub) - they had great flavor! I reduced my sauce a little too much, so watch that - it does thicken up upon cooling. Also, had no need for the olive oil, but used some butter in the sauce. I made 1 1/2 times the original recipe for the sauce & would like to just double it next time. Oh, and the only different ingredient I used was my favorite vinegar: White Balsamic Raspberry Blush Vinegar - My favorite (I could drink it! Well, maybe not). Served with mashed potatoes & sauteed baby zucchini(so cute on the plate!) - an excellent dinner!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED:  I'm giving this 5* for the raspberry sauce, which I think you have to add a T more raspberry to for it to not only taste perfect, but to drown out the wine & create the perfect thickness!  I just wanted to say that this sauce goes great with another amazing dish from this site ("Pistachio Crusted Chicken").  If you haven't tried nuts and chicken before, this is the best!!!  We also like to serve this dish with mashed potatoes since everyone wants a reason to use more sauce!  I HAVE made this recipe as state several times, and each time my husband says not to make it with pork again and rather eat it with chicken.  I agree, so I fry some seasoned chicken until browned then add the sauce! Give it a whirl, you'll thank me!!!

I thought these were very good, nice and juicy and the sauce was good, also.  I made as directed, but doubled the sauce, as many reviews suggested.  I didn't double the vinegar, though, I used only 3 TBSP...this was still a bit too much, I think.  When tasting the sauce while cooking, I wondered how I could 'sweeten' it up a bit, and added a little more orange juice and just a little cornstarch to thicken.  It tasted sooooo much better with the chops rather than by itself.  I will definitely make this again soon, just reducing the amount of vinegar next time.  One more thing, I didn't really think it was necessary to keep the chops warm in the oven while making the sauce, I was afraid it would dry them out, I just put them on a plate and covered them tightly with foil, this worked out fine.  Very good recipe!

Let the chops set all day with the seasoning rub which enhanced their flavor beautifully.  The raspberry sauce perfectly complemented the seasoned pork though I did add a small pat of butter to the sauce to smooth it out. Sauce was a nice mix of sweet and tart flavors.  Served with onion rice from this site and steamed broccoli for a heart healthy dinner.  Thank you Robin Seidel for a nice addition to my recipe collection.

FANTASTIC!!!! My Husband who has a very small appetite went for thirds before rolling over to the couch. He said he thought it was the best meal I'd ever made. I served it with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a recipie for Italian peas I saw on here. Definately one of my favs, even my picky 5 year old cleaned his plate. The sauce was rather thin so we used corell dishes and dipped our pieces or pork chop. Yummy!!!!!

The pork chops in this sauce is amazing. I doubled the sauce, and added 2 Tbsp of butter at the end. I served it with french green beans and roasted red skin potatoes.

This was delicious and I WILL be doing it again. I used homemade orange juice with  mandarin oranges and added a little of the pulp as well.   Excellent flavor.  Good idea to double the sauce for 4 chops.

I made this last night and it is a good recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of sage, but the amount works well on the chops.  I upped the salt to 1/2t.  I had a chief tell me once that most people do not salt their meat enough and i thought 1/4 t was to light for 3 big chops.  The sauce is sweet as raspberry jam is.  I think I would like to try this with another flavor - maybe apricot.  I also used balsamic vinegar, but now wonder if I had used white wine if the acidic quality would have cut the sweetness a bit.  I also had to salt and pepper the sauce.  All in all a very good and different recipe.  Even my picky daughter (who turned her nose up at it in the cooking process) liked it.  Thanks for sharing, Robin.

Unique and tasty! This recipe was very different than any pork recipe I have had, but very delicious. I did add garlic powder to the sage and thyme mix. Also, the raspberry sauce was a little sweet for us, so I added 2t soy sauce to cut the sweetness, but I don't believe it compromised the taste.It was very very good. Our thanks to coppertopped!We will make this again and again.

We thought this dish certainly company worthy, with the advice of special k from fla. Use the OJ concentrate, and absolutely take the time to whisk  a few pats of butter into your raspberry sauce in the end... you will be amazed by the difference! On another note, try adding a bit of garlic and onion powder, parsley and rosemary to the rub, as well, and use a high-end  balsamic vinegar or a good quality red wine. Five star recipe you've got going here, Coppertopped... works really nicely with boneless chicken, as well. Thanks for your submission... It's in my file, for whatever that's worth!

GREAT!  followed another reviewers advice and used blackberry preserves because that's what I had on hand.  Served with linguine tossed with garlic, bread crumbs, and olive oil and some steamed asparagus on the side.  My husband and daughter loved this one, definitely will make it again.  So simple!

I cooked this tonight for dinner and it was a success! As another reviewer suggested, I covered my pork chops (I used boneless chops) while they were in the pan.  Also, I thought the sauce tasted better on the chops than it did when I tried it plain.  It was great with roasted potatoes.

I loved this recipe.  I doubled the sauce, and used raspberry blush basalmic vinegar as opposed to white wine vinegar.  I also breaded the pork chops along with the herbs as well.  very good recipe.

Very impressive dish (company worthy)-- I couldn't believe how quick and easy this was! I added some garlic powder, rosemary, and parsley to the rub, and used 1T balsamic vinegar and 1T red wine vinegar in place of the 2T white wine vinegar. will definitely make again!

Surprisingly wonderful! I'm not fond of 1) pork chops and 2) raspberry anything. But my husband loves both which is why I made this. I was amazed. This was excellent and my husband LOVED it! Next time I will double the sauce, neither one of us could get enough. Tip: Soak your pan with hot water immediately after you spoon out the sauce!

This was a great recipe that both my husband and I enjoyed. I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used red instead and it worked out fine. At my husband's request, next time I will double the sauce.  It taste good drizzled over fresh steamed vegetables and rice.

This was great!  The whole family loved it, and it's become our biggest guest pleaser.  I actually use a tenderloin sliced into medallions, and marinate it in the spices with crushed garlic for a couple hours before cooking. It's quick and easy, but looks and tastes impressive.

I tried this recipe with balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar (just because I didn't have any) and I think it worked well with the raspberry jam.  Great sweet-sour taste.
Don't overcook the chops!

Phenominal recipe!  We grilled the meat with the herb rub and then let it stay warm in a large casserole dish with the raspberry sauce on the bottom.  We put the sauce in a gravy boat so people could flavour their meat to their liking.  Even the pickiest eaters loved this dish!!

This is an excellent way to serve chops. It's my personal favorite. The only thing I do differently is instead of red wine vinegar I use a french rasberry vinegar - super delisous! A splash of soy sauce gives it an asian flare...

The vinegar was WAY too overpowering in this sauce. IF I make this again, and that's a big if, I will not use vinegar. Instead, I'll use plain white wine. Granted, I don't like vinegar on French fries or poured on anything straight. But I do cook with vinegar when it's called for in a recipe like this because I expect it will mostly disappear or meld into the flavors of the dish. That didn't happen here. This is basically a sweet raspberry vinaigrette on pork chops. I even added 2 tablespoons of butter as suggested by one reviewer to make it a richer sauce (and to tame the vinegar's strength). Still, I found it too strong. Sorry! I had great hopes for this one but it was disappointing. I gave it a three stars because I don't like vinegar, so I wanted to be fair in mentioning that and assuming some people may like it.

My family loved it. I doubled the sauce as suggested. I served with squash which tasted great drizzled with the raspberry sauce.

Wow!  Best pork chop recipe I've made BY FAR!  My husband was amazed at how good this was.  It has made it into his top 5 favorite meals.  We didn't have raspberry jam so I used seedless blackberry and we didnt have white wine vinegar so I used Balsamic, and it was outstanding.  

I did need to use more seasoning, as I wanted to coat the entire chop.  Also, my chops were a bit thicker so the cooking time was longer.  I paired it with mashed potatoes and french green beans. Devine. 

Next time I'll try it as is.

Lovely fast new spin on an old standby dinner. Not for the pork chop and mashed potatoes crowd.

This is phenomenal! I had to substitute because I was missing some things, but this is a really fun one to experiment with. I used red wine vinegar instead of white, apple cider instead of OJ, and lingonberry jam (from IKEA) for the raspberry jam. I have made this with raspberry jam too - just as good. I think I would try this with an orange marmalade and OJ next.

4.5 stars
The only problem I had with this was cooking the pork chops the rest of the way in the oven. I think they should be cooked in the skillet longer because it didn't take long to make the sauce.
Other than that, it was SO tasty!

I give this one star because I will not make it again. I followed the recipe exactly and my family thought the sauce was to sweet for the pork and I also found the sage to strong. My husband and I both agreed that this recipe was not a keeper.

These were amazing. Cut my lb of loin into 3 thicker chops but kept the cooking time the same because we all like our meet on the med-rare side. The time in the oven resting while I made the sauce was perfect. I accidently used 1/2 cup raspberry jam but was pleased with the way the sauce turned out and will use the same next time. I served this with Harvest Rice Dish (this site) and they went very well together. Thank you for the keeper.

Pork and raspberries?  I've done pork with apples, peaches, cranberries.  Why not try raspberry?  It was Delicious!!!  This is a meal fit for company.  I had to cook my boneless pork chops a bit longer because they were so thick (the chops from Costco.)  The sauce is wonderful - - I'm sure it would be good over chicken too.

Outstanding!  I did the chops on a hot grill after letting them set for about 20 minutes with the herb seasoned rub.  Worked the raspberry sauce with some frozen berries I had in the freezer, thawing, blender and then a fine sieve to get out seeds.  Loved the polenta  idea from Fitforaqueen. so I just sliced and warmed as well some that I had in the fridge.  Steamed some fresh green beans and tossed them with lemon pepper.  WOW!! knocked this bad boy right out of the park!! The presentation was spectacular with the colors, and the taste was great!!  My guests thought I was some kind of culinary genius. Thanks Robin, I took the credit though!!

Liked this alot.  I only had fresh sage, so will adjust next time i do this.  Also, i only had seedless blackberry preserves, so used that.  I will cut down slightly on the white wine vinegar too, was just a bit too tart.  Lastly, i added a bit of ginger  and used fresh meyer lemon juice in place of the orange juice.  My other half really liked it, so i'll make again for sure.

I doubled the seasoning mix so that I could thoroughly coat all four pork chops.  I also doubled the sauce mix, and substituted basalmic vinegar for the white wine vinegar because I didn't have any.  Love the constrast of the spices with the sweet sauce.

This was delicious! All I had was homemade raspberry preserves (with seeds) and balsamic vinegar. I think I would prefer the balsamic over the white wine. Delicious sauce!

Okay, I DID change this recipe up quite a bit, only because I've made a similar dish before - using a turkey tenderloin & then I saw this recipe using pork and wanted to give it a try. We did have raspberry preserves, but I had some apricot preserves that needed to be finished up; so I used that; and let me tell you - the apricot preserves is AMAZING with the pork! Oh, and the only other change I made was that I used grapefruit juice instead of orange juice (I was out)...the herb/rub blend is very tasty, compliments the pork and the sauce well. :)

These pork chops were by far the best pork chops I have ever had. I followed the recipe completely up until the vinegar part. I like vinegar but we didn’t have any white whine vinegar in the house, so I took the advice of some other users and used regular white wine. Yuuuuuumy, next time I will try it with vinegar just to see how that turns out. Another thing about this dish is that it didn’t take long to make and that is of course always a plus.

It was very good. I sauteed a little chopped red onion in butter before cooking the sauce. Also, another pointer... If you have balsamic vinegar add some of that in place of the white. All in all, my family  really liked it and asked me to make it again.

very easy recipe, but it turns out tasting like something you'd get in a restaurant!  I am not usually a fan of pork chops, but this recipe changed my mind.  It's a keeper! I, like others, added some onion powder and garlic powder to my rub.  Turned out very well!

I'm rating this 5 stars, although I really had to follow everyone's advice.  I prefer a bit of garlic powder/salt to the pork rub.  The first time I made the sauce, I used the Simply Fruit that I had on hand.  I found I had to adjust it by doubling the recipe and adding regular jam with sugar.  What a difference!

A bit of advice for those with THICK chops from Costco/Sam's Club - brown on both sides for 5 minutes, but then also cover the sides for a few minutes each.  When you place the chops in the oven for the warming up - wait 5-10 minutes before starting your sauce.  The chops will continue to cook and be completely cooked when you are ready for them.

Delicious!  Unlike some of the comments, my sauce thickened right up!  I used homemade raspberry jam (with seeds) and apple cider vinegar.  Also cooked handful of fresh raspberries in the sauce.  My husband and I loved this recipe...the chops were seasoned perfectly (didn't change a thing from the recipe); the flavors compliment each other perfeclty.  Definitly recommend you try this one!

I made this for The Woman I Love. But I'm a newish cook and I don't think I did the recipe justice.
She liked it, she said. But I'd never cooked this cut of meat before, and I'm not very good at sauces yet.
I made the recipe to spec, and I found the meat to be underdone; I suppose I should have pounded the chops like other reviewers mentioned. And I didn't let the sauce thicken enough. The flavors were indeed wonderful, but I should have cooked the meat and the sauce longer; if I make this again, it may merit a 5-star rating.

Excellent! I made the following changes. I pounded the pork chops so they were about 1/2 the original thickness. I doubled the recipe for the sauce, next time I will make even more sauce. I garnished with fresh raspberries and a sprig of thyme. Everyone raved!! Not a bite left.

If you are looking for an elegant dinner for two or something special to serve company, this recipe is a must.  I know it states to use boneless,  but I prefer a thick cut, bone-in chop.  They require a little longer cook time, but are moist and tender.   Just the way a pork chop should be!  The secret to a moist chop is to just brown the outside in a pan and allow them to finish cooking in the oven.  I would recommend a higher oven temp if you use a thick cut pork chop. I also made the raspberry sauce ahead of time so there was no waiting around or guessing how long it would take to properly reduce.  The sauce was absolutely divine and compliments the pork chop beautifully.  This one’s a keeper!!

AMAZING!! Even my super old-school mother-in-law (meat and potatoes type) LOVED this! I think it's by far the best pork I've ever eaten. I had huge, inch thick chops so I pan fried them as stated in the recipe for 5 minutes on each side then finished them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until they reached 170 degrees. They were ridiculously moist and tender. I also doubled the spices to coat the 4 chops heavily. 

Also, we LOVED the raspberry sauce. I used homemade raspberry preserves with seeds in them, balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbls. orange juice concentrate with 1 Tbls. water.

Didn't have any raspberry jam, so used mango chutney the first time... was great! Going to make it again tonight, again with the chutney, but will chop the chunks of chutney up a bit.

Made as stated but doubled the sauce.  Pork chops had great flavor, but were a little chewy (I think because they were fried).  Sauce was nice, the teens even liked it.  I'll most likely make again. Thank you.

Very good recipe- and very easy!  Family loved it!  I made double the sauce because I had like 8 pork chops- doubling made PLENTY of sauce!  I placed the cooked chops on a platter and poured the sauce over the top.  Yummy!

I have made this recipe many, many times.  My husband loves raspberries, and it's quick enough to make on a weeknight without too much trouble.  I have discovered two things when making this recipe: 1. Leave out either the butter or the oil, you don't need both, and 2. Any kind of fruit juice will work in place of the orange juice, and doesn't change the taste at all.  I've used fruit punch, lemonade, and various others and they've all been just fine.  You'll enjoy this whether you love raspberries or if you can just stand them every once in a while.

I subbed out the raspberry jam for 1/2 strawberry jam, 1/2 sliced cherries.  I also added a little cornstarch at some other people's suggestion.  Outstandingly good.  I ONLY give it four stars instead of five because I had to quadruple the spices and double the sauce.  UPDATE:  I made the sauce exactly as stated for some chicken that I had baked in nothing more than italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.  HOLY MOLY!  The only problem was that there was not enough!  The kids ate their chicken like crazy people.  I will not add the cornstarch again unless I sub fresh fruit like I did before.  It thickened up very nicely without it although I did boil it for longer than stated.

This is a super easy and fast dinner.  I doubled the sauce and gave some to my mom to use.  Instead of putting in on pork or chicken, she put it on vanilla ice cream and loved it.  Oh mom!

These were really good!  I could see this sauce being to sweet for some people but we loved it!  We doubled the sauce and had the perfect amount.  I used fresh thyme and pineapple sage and squeezed the orange juice fresh.  Instead of butter for cooking the chops I just used some olive oil.  Nice recipe, thanks!

This was an excellent meal! I added a bit to the seasonings, the Perfect Pinch Garlic & Herb was an excellent addition! My boyfriend can be a picky eater, he devoured everything! I added some steamed veggies for a side. This is a winner in our home!

DELICIOUS!  I made with mashed potatoes, broccoli and red peppers.  The sauce was FANTASTIC...like others said, I wish I made more...hubby almost didn't get any.  I also made with a side dish of mango and strawberries which went ok with it; maybe a little too much for this recipe...might be a better dessert afterwards.  my sauce wasn't thick like others mentioned but I used more oil and butter than what it called for..when the sauce was done, I put the pork chops back in the pan to keep them warm VS the oven

This pork chops are delicious!!! However, they are a bit sweet. So, i think i might look for some reduced sugar jam when i go back to the grocery store. Overall, these not only tasted great, they also looked great! I will for sure be making these again soon:)

I liked the sauce but I was not a big fan of the rub. It tasted too much like the thyme which i am not a fan of apparently.

This was great. I made it with blackberry jam instead of raspberry because that's what I had on hand, but I'm sure either would be good. The only issue I had was there was not quite enough sauce for all 4 chops. The flavors were perfect though, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Skipping the butter and the fresh thyme, I still was very pleased with this recipe! I loved the tartness of the raspberry sauce and it was so quick and easy... 5 stars for that alone! I really loved how nicely the dried thyme and sage went with the raspberry too. An easy way to make a lovely sauce for company that is sure to impress! Had the pork with salad...blue cheese, dried cherries, yum!

These were incredibly tasty. Used Balsamic Vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar, and doubled the sauce. Otherwise followed the directions, and will certainly make this again. Mmmmmm.......

This gets five Stars from me!  Easy, quick and delicious.  I used Raspberry Vinegar in the recipe and whisked in a little butter as another reviewer suggested. VIOLA ! The sauce is easy, delicious and would also go nicely with chicken.

Great sweet and tangy flavor.  And it's really easy to make!  I did not bother with the oven and it was fine, the meat should rest for a few minutes before you eat anyway. To me starting the oven seemed like a waste of energy.

This is my favorite pork chop recipe of all time. I have made it many times. One thing I have found that adds a little bit more flavor, is using balsamic vinegar rather then the white wine vinegar. And also, I like to make just a bit more sauce, because nobody can seem to get enough of it. I highly recommend trying this one, it is awesome! Another thing though, the sauce must be prepared in the same pan as the pork chops with all the fat drippings and spices still crusted on the bottom of the pan. It really makes a difference. It sort of ties the sauce to the meat in a way.

"Wow!" is what I have to say whenever I make this dish for my hubby and me. I've taken previous posters' advice and added brown sugar and about 2 tablespoons of butter to the sauce.  I also make the sauce in a separate saucepan from the pork so that it has time to cool and thicken while the pork cooks. I add a touch of balsamic vinegar as well as the white wine vinegar. I found that adding some cran-raspberry juice also helps bring out the flavoring. Hubby loves this so much that I never have leftovers and he devours everything on his first and second helpings before I'm even halfway done with mine!

Excellent, very tasty recipe!  The combination of raspberry jam, orange juice and the spices is remarkable!  I will definitely make this great recipe again.  I'm sure the pork chops can be substituted with beef tenderloin / sirloin.

Easy peasy! Double the  sauce for thicker chops. My husband was sooo impressed as it tasted like something gourmet from a restaurant.  I love it when I find something so simple that seems so difficult to make....impresses the heck out of everyone!

These pork chops were great!  They tasted wonderful and were SO easy to make.  I made as the instructions said, however I used a little more seasoning than recommended, skipped the butter and used olive oil only, and made extra sauce.  The sauce was REALLY good and is what makes the recipe.  Great combination of flavors.  Definitely try this one!!!!

I use this recipe all the time with pork tenderloin. Be generous with the herbs, salt and pepper. I sear each side of the pork on high heat for about 2 minutes, then bake in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes or so (depending on thickness). Tent the tenderloin with foil for 5 minutes before cutting. Amazing recipe! Thank you!

This was very good - you should try it.  I only give five stars to things that are "to-die-for" so don't let that deter you.  One suggestion - make the sauce in a sauce pan and fry the chops in a pan.  If you cook both at the same time in separate pans your chops won't get dried out in the oven.

Deee-lish!  I have picky eaters in my home but this dish was snorked down.  I didn't have raspberry jam so I used ligonberry jam...the one IKEA sells.  I also used the pork chops from Costco but sliced them lengthwise because they are so thick.  Usually my pork chops turn out dry and overdone but tonight they were perfect.

I found this recipe about a year ago, looking for a new way to do something with pork chops. I've done it with the chops, with pork tenderloin, and with boneless chicken breasts. It was excellent all three ways! My teenage son asks me to make it quite often. I have made a few adjustments - doubled the sauce, added a tablespoon or 2 of butter at the end to thicken it a bit. I'd have to say it's one of our favorite ways to prepare pork or chicken now.

I made this for a beautiful Valentine's Day dinner. My family liked this dish.  I used a pork tenderloin instead of pork chops and using the roast,I would say be very careful not to overcook it--use a meat thermometer and cook until it reaches 160-170 and not a minute more.  I took one reviewer's advice and used balsamaic vinegar and doubled the recipe for the sauce.  really tasty.  the only reason i gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is it was a little bit sweet for my taste but still very good

Delicious, quick and very easy.  The sauce is light and just enough sweetness to enhance, not overpower the flavor of the pork.  The cooking time was perfect too, I started with room temperature chops that were about 3/4" thick.  We will making this one again. Thanks

This recipe was delicious.  I love savoury dishes which have a sweet and original twist.  After reading other reviews I also quickly returned my chops to the pan just to coat in the sauce.  I would proabably also add some cornflour next time just to thicken the sauce a bit.  I served with a spinach and roasted sweet potato salad.  Thanks!!

This was fantastic! I served this to my in-laws for dinner last night, along with hot spiced cider, steamed carrots, and Harvest Rice Dish (this site - per another user's suggestion). Fabulous fall meal! I did double the sauce, and sprinkled the finished product with chopped walnuts. Excellent!

Love this recipe!  It's great as written, but double the sauce.  Last night tried a twist to the sauce.  Used apricot preserves (instead of raspberry), kept orange juice the same, used rice vinegar (instead of white wine).  Delicious!

Great recipe!!  Once I seared the chops I placed in a baking dish, covered with foil and baked in the oven and at 300 for about 2 hrs.  They were moist and tender.  Doubled the sauce.  It didn't thicken as much as I would have liked, but maybe I didn't cook long enough.  Either way the pork chops were fabulous.  Served with green beans almondine and a cornflake crusted potatoe casserole.  Elegant and delicious . . . thank you!!!

I wasn't sure how the combination of flavors would be but hubby wanted pork chops so I gave it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised. The sauce tasted wonderful and would also be great with beef tenderloin. I thought the pork chops needed to be cooked more but that would depend on the thickness used. I'm not a fan of pork usually but will be making this again.

The porkchops by themselves were not that great but when accompanied by the sauce, they were great. Especially with a bottle of Pacific Rim riesling. I improvised on the sauce and added some chipotle pepper sauce so it was sweet and spicy. When I make this next time, I will grill the pork. Used thick boneless chops that I had pounded.

I've been wanting to try this for a long time since we love the taste of raspberries but I kept on forgetting to buy "seedless jam" - finally, I said the "the heck with it - I'm using my jam with seeds"  - it didn't make any difference which I knew - just being anal!  This was delicious and so easy. I started boiling my potatoes to make mashed first - while that was cooking I seasoned the bone in pork chops (what we love) and started that cooking and then made the sauce.  Heated up some canned corn.  Dinner was on the table in under 40 min.  The combination of the sage and thyme with the raspberry sauce was great.  A definite keeper and one I would use for company.  Thanks submitter.

Very tasty, very easy.  Just make sure to cook pork thoroughly; 4-5 minutes on each side wasn't quite enough time.

This one is a winner! Quick and easy, using ingredients most cooks have on hand, and it is definitely impressive enough for company. For the sauce I used a mulberry wine vinegar I had on hand; after tasting I added 1 tsp black currant mustard (also on hand--a gift) for a little zip, and that was a grat addition. I think a good dijon or chardonnay mustard would work just as well. I served with Rice with Herbes de Provence from this site and petite green beans. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband and I made this recipe for dinner a couple of nights ago. We loved it. We were running out of ideas for how to liven up basic pork chops when I came across this recipe. It is so simple and easy to make but very flavorful. The combination of spices used on the chops is delicious. Grilling them in the pan left them nice and juicy. The sauce compliments the spices used on the chops so well. This will definitely be going into our normal rotation of weekly dinners. We served it with green beans.

This was amazing. Even my picky husband said he'd eat it again. I especially enjoyed the smoky flavor that comes from pan frying the chops seasoned with the dry herbs. I did take the advice of many others and add garlic powder and I also added cumin. Delicious!!

The sauce on this was delicious, and the chops were seasoned nicely, but the meat was dry.  I'll admit I mistakenly used bone-in chops, so they had to be cooked longer than boneless would have been, but truly, I have never had (uncoated) fried pork chops that did not come out dry.

Meets my criteria - quick, easy and good.  Made a few tweaks out of necessity and one out of preference:  I put the herbs, salt and pepper in the butter instead of rubbing the meat as I don't want to take the time to crush the herbs small enough that the mixture doesn't leave chunks of green on the meat.  As my pantry is low, I substituted white wine for the vinegar, grapeseed oil for olive and a combination of raspberry and strawberry jelly adjusted to taste.  Pork tasted good plain but better with sauce.

The recipe is fantastic, I used raspberry white wine vinegar since I had it on hand and I used 1/2 and it was plenty... I would even reduce it more if vinegar isn't your thing. I served it with Parmesan couscous and roasted asparagus! I can't wait to try it with other fruit jam's. I've got a blackberry one to try next!

This was good, and it was nice to have a such a unique recipe for pork chops, to give us some variety.  Instructions for cooking the meat were great: the pork was seared perfectly on the outside and it was done, but not dry, on the inside.  It wasn't clear whether the pan juices were to be removed before making the sauce, so I left them in, and the sauce was pretty good.  I spooned it over the meat on each person's plate instead of laying the meat in a puddle of sauce on a serving plate.  It needs to be spooned onto the meat (or plate) immediately, before it has a chance to gel up, which happens just minutes after taking it off the heat.  All that said, my family thought the thyme flavor was overpowering, and they really don't like thyme much (though it seemed ok to me), so I may change the spice rub if I make this again.

I was never a big fan of pork chops, but this recipe changed my mind.  I didn't make any changes to the ingredients for the sauce and I thought it tasted wonderful.  Not to heavy on the raspberry and not too heavy on the vinegar.  Be sure to use white WINE vinegar and not straight white vinegar.  It makes a difference.

I was hunting for something a little different for dinner... this hit the spot! It was very tasty. Myonly complaint was that I could not get the sauce to thicken enough. I think that next time I am going to try adding a bit of sour cream and maybe a little cream cheese to make it a little thicker and creamier. But all-in-all... very yummy!

We did not care for this- however, I can see how others might.  I think the recipe is good, but the flavors were not right for us.  The sauce had too much vinegar taste for my two younger children.  We may have liked it more with less vinegar.

This was really good and I don't usually eat pork!! I added garlic to the rub and when making the sauce I didn't have any OJ so I used fruit  juice, I also added about a teaspoon of hot sauce and butter. While the sauce was cooking I added crumbled blue cheese on top of each piece of pork, with the oven door open I put it on broil just until melted. Like I said I don't eat pork but this I tasted and had to eat a whole piece!! Thanks for this GREAT recipe! So easy and so good! Can't wait to try this with chicken!!! : )

This was delicious! I enjoyed this and so did my husband (and he's pretty picky about his meat)! I doubled everything since I had 8 pork chops (except for the vinegar). I had to sub in apple cider vinegar and used savory seasoning instead of the other herbs. I found that keeping the meat warm in the oven @200 didn't dry it out at all. The sauce was so yummy I agree it would make a good salad dressing. I'll keep this recipe in mind when I want to impress relatives!

As others had suggested I added garlic salt to the sage & thyme.  I didn't have any seedless raspberry preserves but I did have a box of fresh raspberries so I squeezed the juice out of those & added to a little more than 1/4 c of some pommegranate jelly I'd made.  Picked an orange off my tree which worked out to 4 Tbsp and exchanged the white vinegar for balsamic (effectively doubling the sauce).  This was DELICIOUS!  Super easy and quick to prep as well.  The sauce does thicken upon standing so make it a little ahead.  I served with simple mashed potatoes from scratch.  Total hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Great combo of flavors!! I double/tripled the sauce, replaced the wine with balsamic vinegar and the oj with manderin orange juice with pulp.  Added butter at the end.   For safety, we like our thick cut  pork cooked to well done, but without the dryness, so I poured the sauce over the browned meat and baked for 15-20  addtl. minutes /until done.  It was VERY tender and FULL of flavor.  Served it with mashed potatos and sauteed green beans.  No leftovers with this recipe.

Very good recipe as written. I suggest using only 2 medium pork chops. And you should consider doubling the rub to ensure full coverage of the two chops. Use a 1 gallon freezer bag to distribute the rub evenly on the two chops.

Wonderful!  Made with thin, bone-in chops as that's what I had on hand.  Doubled the sauce and used cider vinegar.  Plated each chop over a bed of creamy polenta drizzled with the sauce.  On top of the chop I placed a mound of fresh baby spinach tossed in a lemon/olive oil with finely chopped shallots and mandarin orange segments.  A delicious, easy and elegant dinner that came together in well under an hour.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Wow! We LOVED this! Even my seven year old, who is battling strep! I did change the sauce a little due to what I had on hand, some of the reviews and not thinking when I started the pork ;) I broiled the pork, so I didn't get the drippings in the sauce, okay, so it cut down on the calories, we could definitely use that here! I put 1 T of butter, 1/2 C of raspberry jam, 1/4 C frozen OJ concentrate and 1 T lemon juice in a sauce pan. Then followed the directions from there for the sauce. It was awesome with dinner and will make a great raspberry dressing for salad!

OMG This was YUM! I am a grill girl so I actually sprayed my chops with non-stick spray, put the rub on them, and cooked them on the grill-only thing i did different-my whole family loved them-the sauce is such a good twist-my husband is going to try it on his venision steaks-and he is hard to please! Nice one!

Maby it was just me but the sauce was too sweet and drowned out the flavor of the pork ckops which I think needed more flavor themselves. But its such a simple dish I will try it again with more seasoning and tone down the sweetness of the sauce and rate or update my rating again.

I have made a similar recipe, but with chicken and it didn't have the orange juice in it. I also used balsamic  vinegar instead of the wine vinegar, and cayenne pepper for a little kick.

Love this! I made it as written and the sauce is awesome. The 2nd time I made it I doubled the sauce (didn't double the vinegar though).  Everyone loved it! and we use the leftover sauce on cheesecake!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wasn't sure how these would go over because pork chops and raspberries?  Hm.  But I thought my kids would like it so I gave it a try.  To my great surprise both hubby and I enjoyed this quite a bit as well.  When I told him what we were eating he thought it sounded odd, and was surprised to find that it went quite well together.  I will try this with Chicken as well, which to me feels like a more natural pairing.

The sauce was very good and easy to make! My pork chops were dry and I did not put them in the oven, just covered them with foil and put in the microwave so I am not sure what happened. I cooked for 4 minutes on each side. For some reason when I went to make the rub I didn't have sage! I used savory instead and it turned out fine. I doubled the sauce (but not the vinegar). Next time I might try a little more vinegar. It does harden up a lot when it cools which is good. I served with wild rice and green beans. I will make this again- thanks!

Great weeknight dish. I tweaked the recipe a little by not using the oven, it seemed like a waste of a dirty dish and energy. I just cooked the pork in the pan with the rasp sauce, then removed it and set it aside on a dish for the last few minutes so the sauce would reduce. I also added a little bit of wheat flour to the sauce to thicken it up. Turned out great with savory flavor.

This was an awesome recipe. The only annoying part was using the oven. To me, a waste of energy.  I used apple cider vinegar, instead of the white wine, and it came out wonderful. When I make this again, I will have to make sure to have fresh herbs on hand.

Used Rosemary Instead Of Sage. Did Not Use Fresh Thyme. Next Time Drain Butter And Olive Oil In Skillet Before Adding Sauce.

I used low sugar strawberry preserves, balsamic vinegar, and cranberry juice, just because that's what I had on hand, and it was divine!! Skipped the butter and just cooked the chops in olive oil. Also after cooking for 4 minutes on each side, I added the sauce the the pan with the chops and simmered them all together for 5 minutes, basting the chops with the sauce every couple minutes. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to make it again!!

Very good eating, goes great with mojitos! Didn't have any raspberry jam, so used 12oz frozen raspberries and 2T karo syrup for the sauce--had to use 1/2T cornstarch to thicken after filtering seeds out with a sieve. Might add another T of Karo syrup next time. Also grilled the chops instead of frying, added 2T of olive oil to the spice rub for the chops to instigate a little char on the grill--very nice.

Overall, this was a pretty good recipe. It tasted amazing, although my little siblings would not eat it. I recommend adding extra liquid to the sauce. It not only thickened, but completely hardened after cooling for a few minutes. You will probably need more sauce for 4 pork chops, so I recommend doubling the recipe.

My husband wasn't to thrilled when I said I was cooking this. It was like eating at a gourmet restaraunt at our own home. I didn't have rasberry jelly, so I used the seedless blackberry, and red wine vinegar, and it turned out scrumptious. Will make this one on a regular basis. Marcie

Pretty amazing. I had a feeling neither the rub nor the sauce would be sufficient, so I doubled both even before reading all the other reviews. Glad I did. This would be great on top of chicken breasts as well. Will also try using some different preserves (blackberry for one), just to see the difference in flavor.

The sauce is excellent. I thought there was too little dry rub but good flavor.  I doubled the sauce the second night because there was too little for four chops.

This was great - easy to prepare even on a busy weeknight. I served the sauce on the side and told my picky eaters that it was "only for the adventurous." Everyone tried it and loved it. I used balsamic vinegar and it melded wonderfully with the orange juice and raspberry spread (100% fruit). Many thanks for this keeper!

I used boneless pork chops instead of the loin and a strawberry vinegar instead of the white wine - but other than that - I didn't change a thing.  IT WAS AMAZING!

I just made the chops without the sauce, and they were excellent! My only complaint is that they were a little too salty due to allrecipes.com's scaling not working properly (scaling the recipe to 1 serving, the salt and pepper don't scale correctly so I used too much -- I've found that that's a flaw with the site itself, not the recipe). But the seasoning was wonderful, strong and rich, and went fine with a simple creamed corn side dish.

All I can say is that this is the best pork chop I have ever tasted. Made it for my wonderful wife as a part of a Valentines Day candlelight dinner along with grilled shrimp, and it was a real hit. These pork chops brought praises to me from a woman who is usually on the receiving end of praises from me!!! Thank you for a great dinner and for making me look like a genius by sharing this wonderful recipe!

I don't give five star ratings very often, but my husband and I both agreed that this recipe deserved it. It's definately a new favorite for us (and I think he would have eaten the entire recipe's worth at once, if I'd let him, haha).

I realized too late (as in while cooking) that I didn't have any white wine vinegar on hand, so I substituted 1 T balsamic vinegar and 1 T white cooking wine instead, for some fabulous flavor. We both loved the mild sweetness of the sauce. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This recipe was great, I have made it several time for company always to rave reviews.  I changed two things.  1)instead of using chops I used whole pork tenderloin(s), seared them as called for in the recipie, then finished cooking in the oven.  While the tenderloin was resting I made the berry sauce.  Slice the tenderloin on a bias, and drizzle the sauce over it makes a beautiful presentation.  2) I have used all different kind of berry jams, whatever I have had on hand, always seedless though.  Blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, even some boysenberry that was part of a giftbasket I got.

This is a good recipe -- but not an excellent one (I cooked "as is" with no substitutions in order to truly experience the recipe). The distinction from good to great (for me) was in the mild flavor of the sauce. It was incredibly understated -- too much so. I didn't experience any "wow factor" in this dish. 

In short, it's a dish I'll cook again -- but this time will make personal changes (I think balsamic is a smart move, additional salt, maybe some light lemon zest in the sauce, etc).

DELICIOUS!  I am not a big fan of pork chops and was very pleased with this recipe.  Not only was it quick and easy, but the ingredients were simple too.  I used red wine vinegar, but plan to try different vinegars and different jams in the future.

Excellent way to cook pork chops!  I cooked it exactly to the recipe and it turned out excellent!  Only thing I would advise for others is to make sure you don't boil the sauce too long ... there's not that much OJ/wine in the recipe, so it'll evaporate if you don't watch it.  This was my mistake, but all else aside, great recipe!  Husband approved!  Thank you!

The sauce was deliciously sweet and sour and complemented the pork beautifully.  I had to prepare this in advance and left the pork chops in the sauce for a few hours - then just heated and served.  I used balsamic (as recommended by some reviewers); delicious but it spoils the colour - will try cider vinegar next time.

This was the best! Loved the mix of the jam and herbs. I used wild blueberry jam instead of raspberries. Just my preference. Very fast and easy to make even on short notice. Will make this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my, my, my this is a good recipe. Served the chops with white rice and double the sauce. Instead of putting the chops in the preheated oven, I just left them in the pan, and made the sauce around them. We will make these again~!

Made this recipe for supper very very delicious, chged the raspberry for strawberry jam, doubled the sauce recipe and added orange rinds in, after I cooked the pork chops I put them in the sauce and simmered at low heat while the  recipe for Sally's spinach mash potatoes cooked.  The meat was really tender. They all liked it and would have eaten more.  When I doubled the ingredients for the sauce I put a tablespoon less of wine vinegar because I was afraid it would be a little too much acid but the next time will double the vinegar like the other ingredients.

Used pork tenderloin steaks, freshly squeezed OJ, balsamic vinegar, and because I didn't have plain raspberry jam tried fruits of the forest jam(different berries, cherries,etc) instead.  I doubled everything for the sauce apart from the balsamic, which was left at 2 tablespoons. Seared the pork while making the sauce in another pan, and then when the sauce was close to thick enough and pork nearly done, poured it into the pan with the searing pork for another minute or two.  Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli & cauliflower.  

We all absolutely loved it--didn't miss the raspberry jam at all!  I love fruity sauces with pork, so I was in heaven; my husband who is not such a fan of fruit & pork thought it was certainly worth doing again.  The sauce even made the boring steamed cauliflower appealing to the kids! Next time I think I'll try adding marjoram and rosemary to the rub mix(as in Michelle Chapman's awesome 'Herbed Pork with Apples recipe'--and don't worry, there will definitely be a next time!

this recipe is simple, quick and very tasty.  even my four-year-old, who won't eat anything, gobbled this up.  I made it with sliced baked potatoes with herbs and some green beans.  I doubt you could go wrond with nearly any side dish.

Best recipe I've tried so far in 4 months.  Used boneless pork loin - easier to prepare and presentation is great for group meal.  After searing the meat, put in oven for 25 mins at 350.  Tripled the sauce, added butter and cornstarch.  The rub on pork and sauce make this a great "company" dish.

My husband loved these.  Like others I didn't have sage so I used rosemary.  I rubbed the chops and then left them in the fridge for a few hours.  I also added a splash of white wine and balsamic vinegar to the raspberry sauce.  I substituted 2 tbsp of chicken stock for the oj because I didn't have any.  I used bone in pork chops so it took a little longer to cook.  I actually ended up pan searing each side for about 5 minutes then broiling them.  My husband said they were so good that they didn't even need the sauce.

Very good and easy recipe.  I only had seeded raspberry but frankley it added a little better look to the sauce.  I used garlic flavored red wine and garlic powder to the sauce and my wife said it was one of the best sauces I have made. Ot is a  keeper.

The chops themselves were very good.  After reading comments about them being dry, I opted to make them the same time as I did the raspberry sauce so there was no need to keep warm in oven, which did the trick.  We found the raspberry sauce a little too strongly flavored... though good at the first bite after awhile it overwhelmed.  I'd tried the concentrate suggestion, maybe that was the reason and the regular OJ was the better bet?

I have made this several times and it's always a hit. I have used pork tenderloin with the raspberry sauce, and I actually prefer it to the pork chops. I always double the sauce. I still haven't added any sage to my spice cabinet, so I always use crushed rosemary instead. This recipe is so easy that I am adding it to a list of easy recipes for my newlywed sister.

WOW, I love the raspberry sauce !  We barbqued the pork chops instead of frying them.  If you planning to make this, if possible, I would make the sauce the day before and refridgerate. I had sauce left over and reheated it the next day and the flavours had blended way more, and it was fantastic, from now on I will make the sauce the day before.

The raspberry sauce is what makes this dish perfect.  I used two spoonfuls of frozen OJ concentrate, because I was too lazy to mix the juice up.  I think this actually added to the dish, giving it a deeper orange flavor.  The tangy sauce goes perfectly with a mound of steaming homemade potatoes.  Even my toddler loved this dish.

Once I had a $25 plate of Lamb with a port wine reduction...this is EXACTLY THE SAME.. I TELL! This recipe should be the 1st one up! I have the pickiest group of boys. They all loved this. Rasberry jam is not the only one to use, try all sorts of jams. I used the only one I had, Black Currant and white grape juice instead of orange! So impressive!

All I have to say is, WOW!  This was so yummy.  I did make a few changes from others advice.  I added garlic and onion powder to the rubb.  Instead of using white wine vinegar I used red wine vinegar and added 1/2 tbsp. of butter to the sauce.  Next time I will add a little cornstarch just to thicken the sauce a bit.  Oh man even still this dish was excellent. My picky mother even had two servings with extra extra sauce.  I served with pan fried asparagus and white rice.  Will make again.

Yum, these pork chops were very good!  I especially liked the combination of the thyme with the sage.  I cooked the pork chops on the Foreman instead of in the skillet.  I'd recommend cooking them in the skillet because they turned out a little bit dry using the Foreman grill.  Otherwise, they were great and the raspberry sauce was very tasty.

These were absolutely wonderful! I used bone-in pork chops, which were a little harder to cook in the pan, but they had a wonderful flavor! The sauce was great and fairly easy to make! This dish tastes like something you would be served in a 5 star restaurant!

This is a winner.  The only thing I did differently was add all of the spices to about 1/4 cup of flour and then dredge the chops in the mixture.  I feel that they fry up better that way.  They were very juicy and tender, but the chops were about 3/4 of an inch thick.

WONDERFUL!  I took the other suggestions of doubling the rub and sauce.  I added OJ Concentrate instead and used 3T of Balsamic Vinegar.  I found the sauce was nice and think, no additon of cornstarch is necessary.  The sweet factor was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe.

The sauce was fantastic-next time I will double up on it. I will make a few changes to the recipe next time I make it, though. I will cut back on the thyme-it was a bit overwhelming to me. I will also cut the pork into smaller pieces and place it in the sauce to cook a little longer to absorb more flavor. Otherwise it was great.

I'm giving this a three because the pork chops were tasty enough, but the sauce was terrible.  Way too much vinegar taste- and I love dishes with vinegar.  It just didn't seem to mesh well with the other ingredients.

my son gave this 3 stars -- he felt there was too much of an orange juice taste -- the rest of us gave it 4 stars -- I had very thick chops from Costco so I sliced them up and made a double batch of the spice mixture (which was very good on the pork chops) I should have made a double batch of the sauce as well, and it could have thickened a bit more.

I used apple cider vinegar and apricot jam and after browning both sides of the pork just poured the sauce on top and simmered it until the pork was done.  Very easy and tasty.

Had this last night for dinner and It needs work.  The sauce was to sweet and way to thin.  The spice mix was perfect for the chops and a fruity sauce.  Will make again and tweak the sauce, till then only 3 stars.

Great recipe.  I have a similar recipe that is made with chicken, but the raspberry sauce uses basalmic vinegar and includes diced red onions as well, very yummy.  Hadn't thought of using it with pork, but was inspired by this recipe.  I used apple juice instead of orange juice (what i had on hand), and instead of rubbing the herbs on the poek i simply put everything in a plastic bag and set it in the fridge until I was ready for it.

Wow! Fast, easy, and so delicious.  I don’t like raspberries, so I didn’t expect to like this, but the sauce is wonderful.  I cooked chops 6-7 minutes per side, and I doubled ingredients for sauce.  The only change I’ll make next time is to cook sauce longer to make it thicker.  Thanks for recipe, Coppertopped.

The night I made this I was a little disappointed...it was still good but I would rate it a 4. It just didn't taste quite like I'd hoped. I made it with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. Luckily I made extra and we had leftovers, which I ate for lunch the next day and WOW. A definite 5. They were everything I had hoped for the night before. Can't explain the phenomenon, but will certainly make again, even if it's just for the leftovers! :0)

Wonderful!  Husband made with grilled thick chops and added some of the rub spices to the sauce since we didn't have "drippings".  It was fantastic!

I really wasnt sure about this recipe but I had all the ingredients to make it. My daughter liked it alot and that is saying alot. the only thing is, is that it tasted just like a piece of breakfast sausage drenched in raspberry syrup. Once my husband said that I could not get passed the thought. Over all I thought that it was alright but it is not something that I will make in the near future. Sorry!!

Excellent flavor.  I used Pam instead of olive oil and butter for a lower fat version.  Spices are delicious - would even be good without raspberry sauce.  A gourmet-tasting meal in just 15 minutes.

Excellent quick recipe. Being a big sauce fan, I doubled the quantities asked for raspberry jam, orange juice, and vinegar, but I ended with half of the sauce remaining in the saucer... So, don't have to change anything in this recipe, even if it SEEMS to be a bit short on sauce.

What a great new way to prepare and serve up pork! My husband (who doesn't always agree with my choice of flavors) even thought it was tasty. For the first time I used regular vinegar and apple juice because that's all I had. I look forward to making it again with the ingredients listed.

This recipe is phenomenal. It tastes amazing, it's super easy to make, and it's also kind of fancy. Every time we make it, my husband and I both rave about how much we love it. The combination of fresh thyme and raspberry is out of this world. One tip that I've discovered - use tenderloin pork chops, that really takes it to the next level. Also, I cook it on the stove for much longer than the amount of time suggested because undercooked pork kind of freaks me out. But it still comes out juicy and tender and amazing. Love it!!

Very good recipe. The only change o made was using raspberry wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and that was only because I did not have any white wine vinegar. I recommend doubling the sauce because it does not make very much as written.

Wow! This went over AH-MAZINGLY!! I did use more orange juice than asked for- but that was a happy accident. 
Perfect combination of seasonings. I also used red wine vinegar, as I didn’t have the white wine vinegar- and it turned out great! Thank you for being so creative and sharing this recipe! Also- for my vegetarian friends, (I made this for someone and he literally said it was PERFECT) you can use the sauce on potatoes or mashed cauliflower!

Be sure to rub your pork and refrigerate for a couple of hours. This will insure your meat is tender and flavorful. I used a pork tenderloin and thoroughly enjoyed this served over polenta (as one user suggested). I will be having this again soon. Thanks for this recipe.

I ended up used pork loin cut in 1" pieces.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. In the words of my 9 year old "You made me heaven."  All the flavors played so nicely together.  We added some sautéed zucchini and couscous to complete the meal.  There were no leftovers!

I followed this recipe except for the following: I substituted balsamic vinegar of Modena, Italy for the white wine vinegar, as suggested by another reviewer, and I didn't have  the raspberry jam that was called for so I substituted blackberry pepper jelly (which I had on hand), and I believe it knocked this recipe out of the park.  It gave it a real zing and we loved it.  This recipe, with these alterations, will be going in my rotational menu.

Couldn't find the vinegar but it was incredibly delicious without. Could not stress enough how good these were. Best pork chops I've ever eaten. The sweet and savoury worked so well considering how few ingredients were needed. I also put a bit of garlic powder and rosemary on one side of the chops as they were cooking. 10/10. Would definitely make again!

Really, really tasty.  The only thing I tweeked was using raspberry jam w/seeds.  The seeds go well with the texture/taste  of the herbs.  I served it with mashed sweet potatoes (with butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon), fresh green beans, and applesauce (my husband HAS to have applesauce with pork).  He's still raving about it.  Will definitely serve this at a dinner party!

I used blackberry jam, which we had.  4-5 minutes on a side was not enough cooking time for the thicker chops I used, so I baked them about five minutes in 375 oven after the stove grilling on cast iron pan, and meat thermometer agreed.

I use a bit more spices, but not new ones.

This was so good! I'm a very last minute throw together cook. I end up using whatever we have on hand, so my sauce was plum jam (my summer crop), balsamic vinegar and apple juice. It was probably my family's favorite pork chops! Thank you!

I just made this and I would like to say that I used this one but  in fact I changed almost everything in it.  :LOL.  Never the less it was delicious.  I substituted the raspberry for strawberry and the white wine with red wine vinegar,   I also did not use the thyme (my wife does not like the "herbal taste") and it was substituted for marjoram and a little oregano. It turned out great and I had plenty of the sauce for another day.

This is one of my favorite recipes. Sometimes I substitute raspberry Chipolte for the raspberry jam. And instead of the spices, I use poultry seasoning.

I made thisonce before as per the instructions and it wasn't such a hit with the kids and husband.  I made it again today with the following changes.  First I used pork tenderloin instead of chops.  Then I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker, doubling the jam, vinegar, and OJ.  The sauce was a little thin, so I put it in a saucepan and boiled it for a few minutes.  My husband and kids liked it much better this way.

This was incredibly good!  The contrast with the savory seasoning on the pork and the lightly sweet & tangy sauce made it 5 stars for me & beau. Served it with a mushroom risotto .... awesome! Only had black raspberry jam and added about 2 tablespoons of Chambord to soften the sweetness. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

The seasoning was just right on these pork chops.  My husband and 2 year old son loved them.  I put the seasoning on both sides of the chops then put them in the fridge for about an hour before cooking them.

I made this for dinner last night and doubled the sauce to have with chicken tonight...I can't stop eating it! I used 1/4 cup raspberry and 1/4 cup blackberry jam and added a dash or 2 of cayenne. I had it with goat cheese polenta and grilled asparagus and put the sauce on all of it. Fantastic! And so quick and easy. This is a definite keeper!

This is an excellent recipe, we had it for dinner tonight and it was fantastic.  I made it with thin pork loin chops cooked for about 1/2 the time, and for that I doubled the amount of the herb rub for the pork chops since I was spreading it across twice as many (albeit 1/2 as thick) chops.  Also doubled the sauce since I am a sucker for good sauces.

I made my own version.  I was reading the reviews and I will admit I'm not a big fan of vinegar.  So what I did was to put some potato flakes with the dry rub, and omitted the vinegar and just went with the white wine.  Also, I didn't have plain raspberry jam, but a wonderful strawberry-raspberry jam that a friend made, and I'll make it again with no hesitation. I almost forgot about the maybe 1/2 T of cornstarch.  I mixed my wet after cooking the chops and then poured it in the pan and put the pan in the warmed oven. I cook for two anymore and this recipe was the perfect amount with two chops instead of 4.

These chops taste great made just like the recipe says. I do like balsamic more than white wine vinegar so I switched it but either way its the best pork chop recipe I've ever made. I always make double the sauce because its so fantastic.

This was very tasty. I don't think I reduced the sauce enough, as it was very runny. Will definitely be trying this again!

The sauce is DIVINE! Double the sauce. Added a few pieces of cold butter to the sauce at the end. Added garlic powder to the rub as well. Served with garlic green beans and mash potatoes( use the sauce as gravy)

I liked it. I used lemon juice instead of vinegar, and maybe a little less of it and the orange juice than directed.I found the sauce to be a good accompaniment to the rub, and it didn't overpower it at all.

I tried this and didn't love it but didn't hate it either.  I think I was expecting a richer flavor from the raspberry sauce because of the picture.  Although I have to say that I thought it was better the second day.

This recipe is a great addition to the weekly rotation! I do agree with another reviewer that the vinegar in the sauce was a little too much, next time I will try it with white wine instead. As I was tasting the sauce as it thickened, I felt it needed a little salt. I also had some fresh sage on hand and added it at the end. The cooking time for the pork chops was right on. They were crusted on the outside and juicy on the inside. All in all, a great recipe that is quick, easy, and delicious!

I used bone in pork chops and I put the sauce over the chops and put them in the broiler for a few minutes to seal in the flavor... Loved it but I wish I could have had more of the raspberry flavor come thru...

First time I followed the recipe, was very good, made some tweaks and now its awsome. Doubled the seasoning rub, left out the butter that was to be fried with the oil, but put it in to finish the raspberry sauce. Both times I did not have Raspberry jam, so I subbed with rasperry spread, and the second time I was out of orange juice so I used lemon in its place, still absolutely fabulous! This recipe is so forgiving, you've got to try this! Restaurant quality!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe last night.  The only substitution I made was balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and instructions as printed.  Everyone loved the raspberry sauce!  It had a great flavor.  However, it sets up very quickly and becomes too thick--almost back to the consistency of the jam.  We also would have preferred more flavor on the pork chops so next time I will add some additional spices to the rub--perhaps chipotle which would be a nice contrast to the sweetness of the sauce.  Overall, though, this was very good and very easy.  A definite keeper!

i wanted to try something different and thought bf's daughter's jam in the fridge was raspberry.. it was strawberry preserves and it still worked.. used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine and added two more tablespoons of oj to the sauce.. omitted the olive oil, only used butter.. used about 1/16 tsp of GROUND thyme and sage.. think i can up it to 1/8 tsp next time.. and will definitely be doubling the salt.. other than the pork being a little on the chewy side we really enjoyed this.. ty for the recipe

Just made this for dinner and WoW! I didn't have sage but it still tasted good. And I added more jam and pinch of wheat flour to thicken it up. Instead of putting the sauce on the bottom, I put it over the pork chops. Added a couple of raspberries on top the chops and presto! Yummy dinner for the family :) A great recipe for something new with the same ol pork chops!!

Just made this tonight for dinner.  As I type this my daughter and boyfriend are finishing their 3rd chop each.  My b/f has a look of ecstasy on his face & I think he may need a moment or two alone.  The only tweaks I made for the sauce is add a dash of soy sauce and a couple of tbsp butter after the sauce had reduced.  Family said, and I quote, "We've never eaten anything this good.  Ever."

Tried this last night and they turned out great.  However, I don't know if we just had a smaller sized chop or what but the seasoning on it seemed a little heavy.  The Raspberry sauce was great after it sat and thickened up, at first it seemed like it had too much vinegar, but didn't afterall.  We will definitely be making it again, maybe just cutting down the Sage/Thyme a bit

I am glad I read the reviews while I was cooking this. Some people said the vinegar was really overpowering in the taste and I agree. As I was cooking, I was tasting it. I followed the directions and the vinegar was really strong so I added another 1/4 cup of the jam and it was still too strong for me. So I added another two big spoon fulls of jam and that seemed to help. I could still taste a little of the vinegar in the end but it was not overwhelming like it was in the begining. I also used strawberry jam instead of raspberry but I think it came out great. I am going to try blackberry next time. I would definatly cook this again.

I made this for my Wife (who doesn't like pork chops), she liked it so much that she had seconds...
I cooked the pork covered for 2:50/side Andersen balsamic vinegar instead of white wine, and I added a little more than 1/4 cup of Jam, I also let the sauce boil on low for about 7 min. to thicken up more. Be careful though, the pork will get tough if left in the oven for too long.

I made this tonight and my husband said it was one of the best things he's ever had.  I even took the advice of another reviewer and accompanied it with the Italian Peas also on this website. Absolute perfection!  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't believe how easy and simple it was. The only change I made was that I had a strawberry chocolate balsamic which I substituted for the wine vinegar.  Great flavor.  I also doubled the raspberry sauce and I have enough left for another meal.  Can't wait to try it with chicken breasts.  This recipe is a major winner!

I made this for dinner last night.  Everyone loved it.  I had to make a few changes to the sauce based on what I had on hand.  I used red wine, raspberry jam (seeded - it's all I had on hand), balsamic vinegar and completely omitted the OJ (didn't have any).  The sauce got a lot thicker quicker than I anticipated, so I just added more jam and wine until I liked the consistency / flavor combination.  I ended up using about 1/2 cup wine and jam and the 2 tbs vinegar.  That sauce combination was enough to drizzle over (I like the presentation of sauce over the meat better than under - just a personal preference) for 6 pork chops. Will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Oh, I also browned the chops for 5 minutes per side, then put into a covered dish on the warming burner on my stove as opposed to putting them in the oven.  I had chili roasted sweet potatoes hanging out in there and it was ENTIRELY too hot for the chops :)

This recipe is so easy and so adaptable. I have made it with all different kinds of juice, all different kinds of jam, and last night when I discovered I was out of jam I made it with a handful of fresh raspberries and a spoonful of sugar. It still came out fantastic and even a wonderful consistency! It takes only a few minutes to through together and is super easy, but gives spectacular results. I agree with other reviewers on adding a bit of cold butter to the simmering sauce helps give it a satiny finish that just tastes better (although it's certainly not necessary, it IS good.) Otherwise just be careful not to overcook the pork and you can't lose wih this one. Yum!

Amazing!  My family loved this recipe.  My husband loved the chops so much that he felt that it did't need the sauce.  The sauce was good, but I think next time I will decrease the amount of vinegar I used.  Also,  I did not place the chops in the oven.  We will definitely make this again.  We had it with white rice and squash.

I only followed this recipe for cooking the pork chops since I didn't have most of the ingredients for the sauce....  They were awesome.  And in place of the sauce, I served with IKEA's lingonberry jam.  Loved by all who ate it!  Thanks for teaching me how to cook a pork chop.  :)

The sauce is wonderful.  The first time I tried this was at a friends place, but she did this exact recipe with chicken breast.  Both taste wonderful.

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes to accommodate my limited pantry selection. I used red wine vinegar instead of white, substituted boysenberry jam and used fresh minced sage. Delicious!

Whole family loved, even my picky daughter who doesn't like pork.  I would increase the sauce.  I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar.

Great starting recipe.  I make it with 2 Pork Tenderloin, tripple the herbs, add garlic and onion powder.  For the sauce, I use 4x and use 1/3 of the white wine vinegar (too overpowering).

This was delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed this and will make it a staple in our household.  I used pork steaks on the grill and made double the sauce on the stove.  I used seeded jam which was fine since we don't mind the seeds and I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red.  I served it with the green bean and cherry tomato side dish also on allrecipes.  Yummy!

sauce had a good flavor - used a bit more of the raspberry jam and substituted balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar as someone suggested.

The 5 stars is for the raspberry sauce. Definitely double the sauce! I only had raspberry jam with seeds and I was worried it would be gritted, but it was still great. I guess boiling the sauce softens the seeds enough so you chewing on them.

We intended to make this with pork but ended up having to make it with chicken (our pork chops didn't look so good when removed from the packaging).  I'm sure this would be great with pork, but it was also GREAT with chicken.  Very flavorful, perfect blend of spices.  We made exactly as is (except for the pork), and we wouldn't change a thing.

My family and I love pork chops and these were very good.  The flavor of the chops were great without the sauce.  My 5 year old son ate his without and love them.  I used sauce for my husband's and my chops.  The hubby loved it but I found it too sweet.  There was barely enough sauce for two of us so I can understand why someone would want to double the sauce recipe.  I will make this again but will omit the sauce for myself.   Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for the family last week, and the flavor was great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I might make next time (and I will make again), is to increase the sauce.  Everyone wanted to dip each bite of chop in the sauce for extra zing! Thanks for sharing!

This was easy and delicious! I substituted 1/2tsp rosemary/oregano, as I did not have Sage, and Cran Raspberry juice for the oj- but still give it 5 stars as I know it will be just as amazing as written. I served my sauce on the side and dipped as I went, though the herb combo is amazing by itself!

Wonderful recipe for "fancy-ing up" pork chops! Easy to make, inexpensive ingredients I suspect apple cider vinegar or maybe even balsamic would work, altering the flavor but not hurting it one bit.  My finicky daughter asked for her sauce on the side because she didn't think she'd like it - and ended up using every last drop.  The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is the sauce never thickened up and looked a little messy on the plate.

I brushed the pork with a little raspberry jam/OJ mixed together before rubbing in the spices, grilled it instead of cooking it on the stove, and basted them a few more times with the jam/OJ during cooking and they came out perfect. The sauce was very nice and complimented the pork well.

A bright, beautiful hit! Nice flavours together with the sweet raspberries and the bite of the vinegar, but with pork it was just delicious.  Both of us (hubby & I) will definitely make this again and again.  Differences: I used fresh raspberries, from our garden, mashed with some sugar, and red wine vinegar.  Only used olive oil but no butter.  As suggested, kept the pork warm under foil and it was moist & warm.  All else was the same.  I want some more already! :)

This recipe is great. It's quick and ease to make, and the sauce is heavenly! I, like other reviewers, doubled the recipe for the sauce and for the thyme/sage. I served with mashed potatoes and julienned carrots, sauteed in the same skillet as the sauce. This infused the carrots with the same raspberry flavor - delicious!

Such a great recipe! This was very easy to make. The herbs on the chops are great just on their own. The sauce was perfect- I agree it was a bit strong when tasting it by itself but was perfect with the pork chops. I think I'll try the sauce as a dressing on a salad with chicken, walnuts, dried cranberries, etc.

Wow!  We had this for our special Valentine's meal, and I thought I would have to coax the man and kids into eating it because of the pretty red sauce.  Not so.  They devoured this, and it was gorgeous.  I used balsamic vinegar after reading the reviews, and it was great, though I bet the white vinegar makes an even  prettier sauce. Maybe next time I will try white balsamic vinegar- I have seen it at Trader Joes.  Now, take my advice and double the sauce.  If you don't, you will wish you had! My only complaint is that I could not find a seedless raspberry jam made without high fructose corn syrup.  Oh well. Can't be perfect all the time!  Thanks for this recipe.  Incredibly good!

This was surprisingly tasty. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, since I'd never thought of pairing raspberries with pork. I served the sauce in ramekins because it was on the thin side, and we just dipped our pieces of pork into it. The sauce will thicken slightly once you remove it from the heat but not a whole lot. My boyfriend, whom I figured would hate the sauce, ended up eating it by itself with a spoon. I discovered at the last minute that I did not have white wine vinegar, so I had to substitute rice vinegar. I did not have orange juice, so I squeezed the juice from an orange. I used Italian seasoning in place of the sage and thyme, and I used raspberry preserves rather than jam (personal preference.) I felt the sauce was a little too sweet, so I will most likely try experimenting next time with different additions to reduce the sweetness. I also think I might like the sauce better with chicken. At any rate, the sauce from this recipe will definitely be repeated!

This has nice flavor and table presentation for such a quick meal - thanks!  Next time I will bake or broil the chops (we think they are more moist this way) and for the sauce I'll carmelize some onions to take the sauce over the top!

SO GOOD! Three things:
1. All I had was apple cider vinegar, so I used that and added a splash of white wine to get the flavor. 
2. Also only had raspberry jam with seeds, but that worked out pretty well too :).
3. I usually cook for one, but I made sauce enough for two and was glad I did because I LOVED the flavor!
Excellent recipe--I'll be making it again and sharing it!

Based on other reviews, I made the sauce with balsamic vinegar but I think I will use white vinegar next time or omit it altogether as I thought it had a little too much of a vinegar bite to it. But the sauce tasted really great otherwise. I will just have to modify it to our liking. Thanks for a great recipe!
Second time I made this I did use white vinegar and it was great. I made the meal with chicken breasts instead though and my husband said he liked it more than the pork. Both are great though!

Nothing exceptional. It was tasty though. I think the chops may have tasted better if they are simmered in the sauce for a while then served with sauce on top.

Delicious.  The chops would have been fine even without the sauce...  You can substitute pineapple juice for orange juice and it still tastes great.  The only thing I will change when I make this recipe again is to lower the butter and olive oil a bit -- the chops and sauce were just a bit on the oily side.  But only just a bit.

This was WAY easier and tastier than I previously anticipated! The porkchops came out very juicy, and the herbs were very complimentary, to the meat as with the raspberry sauce. I actually made the raspberry sauce for a topper on pancakes recently which my husband had suggested to me would be good, and it was!! Fabulous, easy recipe. Thank you!

This was my first attempt at cooking pork, and I'm very glad this was the recipe I picked. My boyfriend said it was the best thing we've eaten all semester! I used thin-sliced boneless pork chops, garlic infused red wine vinegar instead of white, and served it with rice pilaf and rosemary carrots. This will definitely become a staple in our house. :)

Best pork chop recipe ever!! You can do this with the really cheap cuts, even and it still turns out fabulous. Looks gormet and doesn't take very long at all. some suggested doing the sauce first or doing it in a different pan and I would discourage this. The drippings from the pork chops and the left behind spices from the rub, really, really help the sauce. I tripple the rub because it never seems to be enough for my chops. My 3 year old wants two every time I make this and there are never leftovers.

I made this for my wife, who grew up among a family of chefs, on a whim one evening and she loved it. The flavors are fantastic. I also served it at my Elks Lodge, as an appetizer for Valentines Day using Pork tenderloins sliced into medalions. That too was a great success.

Excellent! I did take the advice of others and added a little hot pepper sauce to the sauce and a little butter.  My Pork chops were really thick boneless ones about 2 inches thick, so I cooked them a little slower - turned out super juicey.  I made the sauce in a separately  sauce pan.  I will definitely be making this again!  Couldn't get enough of the sauce - suggest doubling the sauce at least.

This was heavenly and very elegant looking on the serving platter. Followed the recipe as it said and only added a few diced onions to the oil and sauteed after removing pork chops. I was very glad I doubled the sauce so it enabled me to use some on the rice that I served with this dish. My family says they will definitely want this again. Thanks

Made these for my husband, and wow were they good. The sauce was a little thin so I ended up adding a little more jam. My advice would be to make all your side items and the sauce first, because the porck chops literally take 4-5 minutes to cook. The seasoning was excellent, I even enjoyed and I dont really care for pork chops. Thanks

Yummy! Like some other reviewers, I used balsamic vinegar and blackberry jam because that's all I had. It was excellent. We had it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh baked asparagus. The sauce went well with everything. Definitely will make again!

Very tasty.  If you are using thick cut chops I would recommend putting the lid on while you are browning, mine didn't cook all the through, so I had to zap them in the micro (family was at the table, pounding forks!).  They still turned out tender and juicy though.  The sauce was excellent, as well as the seasoning.

I just made this and it was wonderful.  As others mentioned, I used blackberry jam (sugar free) and red wine vinegar.  The chops smelled wonderful as the browned and the sauce is a incredible compliment to the pork.

Wow, this is delicious! Family gobbled it up. I substitute the white wine vinegar with balsamic as others had suggested. The sauce thickens a bunch as it cools. Stir 2 to 3 minutes as the recipe says or you will end up with a jelly consistency instead of a sauce.

This was a very good recipe = the only thing I changed was to add reduced fat townhouse crackers to the spices and dredged the pork chops in egg beaters and then dipped them in the cracker/herb mixture - very delicious!

These are very easy and the sauce complements the meat perfectly.  I make these all the time with green beans and baked white sweet potato.

So good. The raspberry sauce makes this such a nice dish. Easy enough for fast weeknight meals, nice enough for dinner guests. I used raspberry balsamic vinegar.

Superb! Definitely a dish to serve for company as well as for a family meal. When we made it for about the fifth time, I added 1 Tbls. of creamed horseradish to the fruit sauce. Delightful!

I made a gravy out of the remaining juice/sauce and the flavor was too strong.  If there is a next time, I will not make a sauce/gravy out of the juice.

Delicious.  I grilled the chops instead of pan frying and timed the sauce so I wouldn't have to keep the chops warm (and chance them drying out).  For the sauce, I reduced the vinegar to 1 Tbsp. and switched to Apple Cider vinegar.  I also stirred 1 Tbsp. of unsalted butter in to the sauce after removing from the heat.  It was really, really great.  My husband finally likes pork chops!

I didn't have sage on hand, so I used rosemary instead and added 1-2 tbsp. butter to the sauce and it came out wonderful, even my friends who are not fond of raspberry flavor LOVED this.

This is wonderful.  I cooked the raspberry sauce down until it was a glaze then put the chops back in the pan for a bit to get them good and glazed.  My little girl loved this meat.  I had to put the serving dish by her so she could dip her meat.

This was excellent! Everyone loved it! I was a little leary of the raspberry sauce but pork tends to taste good with fruity sauces. This raspberry flavor with the pork was perfect. Everyone loved the raspberry flavor that their wasn't enough sauce left to use with the last pork chop. I'll probably make a 1 1/2 to double batch of the sauce next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is pretty darn good - the credit has to go to the sauce. I seasoned some very thick pork loin chops also adding garlic powder. For the sauce, I quadrupled it so there would be plenty - but I used apple cider vinegar and just a few shakes of hot sauce for just a little zing. I think the pork chops can be made any way you would like - it's the sauce that makes this recipe stand out. Great job and thanks for nice recipe.

I have fixed many recipes from allreceipes and this is the 1st time I've ever taken the time to actually rate one. This is now one of my family's favorite dishes. I doubled the sauce but everything else was perfect. I passed it on to my Mother and Grandmother. I think they will like it as much I do!

This recipe is a lifesaver!!! I needed something kind of sophisticated for my inlaws and this was perfect. Even my mother-in-law complimented me! I made the sauce the night before and it was wonderful. I just put the sauce on the table and let people put it on at will. There was nothing left!!! Will definitely makee again.

WOW! This recipe is wonderful.  I had fresh thyme and fresh rosemary which I chopped up finely for the rub.  The combination of those spices was great.  The raspberry sauce, really added the perfect accent.  Easy and delicious - defintiely a keeper.

My husband and I loved this recipe - both for its taste and ease in preparation on a weeknight.  Pan fried the thin chops in just a little oil.  Used homemade raspberry jam - made 1 1/2 times the sauce and served over rice with Pan-Fried Asparagus(another delicious recipe on this site).  Easy, quick, delicious meal!

I loved the sauce!  I think I did double it and that helped for the next day's leftovers since we used so much of the sauce for the first servings.  The pork chops were great too and moist.

This was quite good - and relatively easy.  I used 1 tbsp of condensed frozen orange juice; omitted the vinegar, and used white wine, instead.  Excellent - thank you!

Likely the best chops I've ever eaten, very moist and with a slight sweet taste. I used a red wine vinegar instead of white. Doubt it made any difference but it's what I had on hand.

Good, just as everyone said.  I doubled the sauce, but left out some vinegar.  I used half of the white wine vinegar and half balsamic.  It gave it a nice tangy flavour, too!

My porkchops took longer to cook, but they were also really thick.  Should've pounded 'em down.

Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe. Though it was a 5 star rating I was reluctant to try. I was concerned it may be too sweet but it couldn't have been more perfect. The sweet and tangy combo made it enjoyable for all. I never saw my kids finish their dinner so fast and even asked for seconds. The only change I made was I used black raspberry jam but I am anxious to try this again with other flavors.

This is a wonderful change to the apple recipes I usually use.  This is a snap to make and looks beautiful.  I used Strawberry jam cause I ran out of raspberry and I can't wait to try it again with Raspberry!

I really enjoyed this easy way to liven up pork chops.  I have made these several times now.  I feel like I'm serving something "gourmet" that takes only a few minutes more than just throwing the chops on the grill or in the oven.

This is really delicious!  I used everything as is except the jam, i substituted strewberry-ruhbarb preserves b/c that's all i had.  It turned out great.  The meat is moist and the sauce devine.  I doubled the sauce & had just enough.  You don't have to thicken it, just simmer it for longer.  the longer it cooks, the thicker it becomes!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I like this, but it was lacking something - not sure what - just didn't have pizzazz - but pork does not always have pizzazz - I wonder if I had added something to give it a bit of a crunch - like sprinkling chopped pecans or walnuts over the dish it would make a difference??

This was wonderful!  I pounded down the thick chops so they would cook better.  I did end up covering them the last 3 minutes to ensure doneness.  I had to use jam with seeds which I wouldn't recommend.  Always double the sauce recipe!  You can never have too much sauce.
YUM!

I added a little more spice than called for... I salted and peppered my pork loins first, then put the spice mixture on later. They were fantastic, the sauce was very tasty. I also use balsamic since I didnt have white wine vinegar. Also, watch your cooking times- I had half inch thick loins and they probably only needed like 3-4 minutes per side.

Tasty! I goofed and bought bone-in thick cut chops, so the meat was a little tough, but that was my mistake. The herb rub had good flavor and the raspberry sauce was excellent. Next time I'll thicken the sauce with cornstarch - it was a tad runny. We like thick sauces! Also topped with chopped pecans. Over all a very promising dish with the right meat! I may even try it with tenderloin cut into medallions.

My wife absolutely loves this recipe. She's never been the fan of raspberry that I am, but this dish has made her a believer. We have it at least once every two weeks. To make it easier to prepare, I pre-mixed the seasonings in a shaker. It's a wonderful mixture on any pork recipe. I use it for my roast pork tenderloin.

My husband says he "doesn't like jelly in cooking" so this wasn't his thing, but I thought it was great! We cooked the pork chops on the grill instead of on the stove. The raspberry sauce is what makes the recipe though. Very nice change for pork chops.

Not bad.  I cooked on med-high heat in a covered skillet 4 minutes per side.  The chops were so moist because I used boned pork chops.  Rasberry sauce good but my 10yrs. old Daughter said it was gross.  She is not a picky eater either.

I was looking for something than the usual "put pork chops in cream of mushroom soup and bake", boring boring boring b-o-r-i-n-g.  Now this recipe was AWESOME. Very different flavour for the pork.  Great tasting.  I have given birth to 2 of the fussiest eaters since begin time, and they even LOVED IT!! So, with that I folded up the paper I printed the recipe on, and put it in my recipe box.  I will be making this often!
Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Good recipe. Due to what I had on hand, I had to use red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar and was pleased to find that it worked just fine.  I pounded my chops before cooking and found that the cooking time listed worked just right.  We had this with buttered, smashed potatoes and a green salad.  A good 30 minute meal.

FANTASTIC! You have to cook the chops longer then the recipe calls for.  But other then that, i wouldn't change a thing!  I also made the mashed potatoes and carrots with the meal, and the raspberry sauce even tasted wonderful on the potatoes!  Thanks for shareing!

Really great recipe!  Needed a few extra minutes to cook the chops...mine were thick.  The sauce was really excellent, though, and would be even better with fresh raspberries.

I was looking for a raspberry sauce recipe to make with chicken, so I followed the directions using chicken instead of pork.  My family LOVED it!  It's easy and special enough for guests.  Will definitely make it again.

Oh man, was this ever good! I made for my parents birthday supper, and everyone was raving and my mom bragged about it to everyone. The sage and thyme just go so well with the rasberry sauce... Mmm... I wish I was eating some right now!! Simply delicious, and so simple! There's nothing to change on this one!

Easy to make. We used Rice Wine vinegar because the market didn’t have white wine vinegar. Delicious nonetheless.

I used 4 fruit jam and pineapple juice as i didn't have orange juice.   I also added a tablespoon of butter at the end... i know that is a lot of butter but it was very good.   i made roasted sweet potatoes and  Yukon gold potatoes  and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash with thyme and rosemary.  the sauce was good with the potatoes as well.   very delicious  i will definitely make this  again.

Added some dried rosemary to the rub and brushed them with olive oil before grilling over charcoal. This is now my new favorite grilled chop. The sauce is perfect with the smoked flavor without overpowering it (I used OJ concentrate for a little extra orange without thinning the sauce). Just an excellent recipe.

My chops were not done enough in time given so they had to go back in skillet and then I probably overcooked  them.
I used balsamic vinegar, omitted the OJ b/c I didn’t have any and used raspberry sauce instead of jam.  I probably over cooked them, next time I will cover them then cook them according to recipe and then put them in with the sauce to cook another 3 minutes (if they were thicker like the ones I got this time)

This was very good.  Husband liked it as well.  I didn't have white wine vinegar and used apple cider vinegar instead.  I was a little hesitant about the vinegar flavor and used half the amount.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I did find that I had to make extra herb mixture and I only made 3 chops.  The amount of sauce was sufficient for the 3 chops.    We usually only eat 1 chop each but this was so good we split thee last one as well.

Look forward to making this again! Was a hit with the kiddos (6 & 3), so definitely making its way into our rotation. Didn’t have sage, so substituted Rosemary. Didn’t have white wine vinegar, so substituted white cooking wine. Doubled the sauce and will probably make this again trying chicken or steak. Sauce was a total hit! Thanks ??

A really easy and tasty meal to make for any day of the week! I made it for my family and they all enjoyed it, and the ingredients themselves all worked well together. It barely took half an hour and after a long day at college it was just the right amount of time. Word to the wise: wait until you are about to serve to make the sauce as it will coagulate a little if left to sit for a period of time. Other than that I 100% recommend this for any occasion.

Delicious sauce.  I added a little more raspberry jam as others had suggested.  I used thick pork chops and, after frying, the internal temperature was still low, so I turned the oven up to 375 degrees and baked them for about 10 minutes.  That was probably too much, so I have to work on that.

Good, simple recipe. I make it a couple times a month. We've found that it works just as well with chicken as it does with pork. It's especially great when the meat is grilled.

OMG!  How wonderful.  Yummy and easy and quick.  Who could ask for anything more?  I used Black Current Sauce instead of jam to reduce the sweetness.  Very good.  I added some butter as other reviewers suggested, but not sure it was necessary.  I'll definitely make this again & try it on chicken.

This recipe works great! It works as well with other berry preserves and cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Timing is everything and if your doing thin cut chops the warming oven is a must.

Very tasty! The sage and thyme did it for me. I had to substitute lemonade instead of orange juice but the sauce turned out really well.

I was worried about the cooking time for the pork chops because we tend to buy thick cuts but they cooked thoughroughly.  I used a fresh sqeezed orange in place of the 
oJ.  I  started a herb garden this summer so i had fresh tyme on hand. I loved the flavor it gave to this recipe.

I didn’t have on, so I used orange marmalade and increased the white wine vinegar a bit.  Delicious!

I gave this 4 instead of 5 because the sauce needs some butter to cut the vinegar.  I made this with bone in chops.  I seared the chops 4 minutes on each side at high heat, transferred to a cookie pan and finished in the oven for 6 minutes.  Made the sauce, doubled.  Added 2oz brandy and flamed to cook that off then added 2 pats butter.  Plated straight to plates and drizzled sauce over all.  I served with baby red potatoes amd carrots roasted with same herb mix as went on the chops.  Husband loved it and will make this again!!

I have made pork chops too many times to count. These are now at the top of my list. The only change I made was using 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 1 1/2 tbsp of red wine. Wow what a flavor!  Thanks so much for posting this, definite keeper

So good!  I used large, bone-in pork chops so I doubled the recipe. I broiled these on high for about 8 minutes on each side which eliminated the need for  butter and oil for cooking. I didn't have raspberry jam (blaming my husbands late night sweet tooth). I used grape and crossed my fingers and it still had a really good flavor.   The chops and sauce TOGETHER are delicious.  I will make again and will probably try on chicken as well.

This was excellent!!!! I’ll definitely be trying it with chicken as well. I followed the suggestions of others and used balsamic vinegar, an extra Tbsp of jam, and added 2 Tbsp of butter as the sauce cooked. I also didn’t have any OJ so I made “lemonade” by mixing a Tbsp of lemon juice plus 2 Tbsp of water and a spoon of sweetener and then took the 2 Tbsp from that. Still delicious! This was one of my favorites!

I tried this out - I need to clean up my technique a bit. I am not used to cooking pork chops in a pan, so that in combination with holding them in the oven resulted in the chops drying out. Also I used a raspberry spread instead of jam, which is less sweet, so I probably could have skipped the vinegar. My wife agreed, though, that this recipe is worth trying again. Maybe another time I will use lingonberry jam, or perhaps even some tart cranberry sauce.

Hi there Ladies I just have a question about this recipe.  Someone said you need to only use boneless pork chops for this recipe  and I was wondering why.  I would think the bone in would be more flavorful.  I haven't tried the recipe but I plan to since I purchased all the ingredients.  Thanks ladies.
Okay so since my post above (yesterday) I made the recipe today and I used both bone in and boneless center cut filets.  I found the pork to be tough and followed the cooking directions exactly.  So next time I will do as one of the ladies recommended and that is use chicken instead of the pork or maybe use pork tenderloin.
Also I did not like the thyme - I thought it was too overpowering and will use coriander instead which goes real well with pork. But probably still use the sage as well.
However I did really like the raspberry sauce very much and will try this recipe again making the changes mentioned.  Thanks for any comments or advice ladies.  I think this is a great site to exchange cooking/recipes for all of us.

I used a couple of 1" thick butterflied pork loin chops so, I lowered the heat and increased the time in the skillet. This recipe produced what was among the tastiest and easiest to prepare chops I've had the opportunity to cook. I served it with steamed asparagus and breaded, fried zucchini. The breading used the same herbs and garlic bread crumbs. Garlic was a good match with the raspberry sauce--it might find its way into the sauce in the next batch.

So I made a change to this recipe by making the sauce and spices a marinade. omg nom nom nom so... make the orange juice plus white wine vinegar a part of the marinade. Let it go for two hours it gets the intended flavor. Plus make the mashed potato and gravy with the raspberry sauce. perfect. great recipe.

All the change I made was substituting the raspberry jam with hot pepper jelly. It was so delicious. We served them with mashed potatoes and white rice. I highly recommend it.

Great recipe!  Somehow I did not have thyme or sage so I used Herbs de Provence instead. For the sauce I used a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and one of red wine vinegar. I happened to have some fresh raspberries so I chopped a few and added them. Also happened to have some orange blossom water so I added a tablespoon. Smelled lovely. My spouse who prefers plain food just loved it.  Will definitely make this again. Would be a fun company dish.

Followed directions for chops in respect to ingredients however, I rinsed and dried the chops, and sprinkled the herbs directly on the chops and rubbed in.  Cooked as specified.  Made the sauce as directed, tasted and found a little heavy on vinegar so I just dropped a spoonful more of jam into the mix.  I used red wine vinegar as I didn't have white.  Sauce is excellent and so were the chops.  I actually would rate a 4.5 star since I had to tweak sauce and method of seasonings chops.  I noticed one reviewer added corn starch to thicken the sauce, don't do that, just let it simmer, it will cook down and once it starts to cool down, it thickens even more.

Exceptional.  No need to put in oven to keep warm before sauce is done.  So far used black cherry or raspberry or huckleberry jams.  Used orange juice and another time used lemon juice (which I freeze in cubes).  Also use fantastic balsamic vinegar instead of vinegar.

This is so good.  I only changed a couple things to use what I had on hand, but the original recipe looks great.  I used red balsamic vinegar and added 2 tablespoons of butter to the sauce at the end (a tweek from my son's roommate who is a chef in California and I also happen to love that guy (he helps me so much) and I used red sweet wine instead of orange juice.  Mainly because nobody here likes orange juice and I have a teenage daughter so I always have wine on hand. HaHa  .

I didn't have white wine vinegar so I substituted Raspberry vinegar and white wine. I added 1 T finely chopped red onions to the sauce for 1 more flavor layer. I must say that the timing and temps in this recipe resulted in the juiciest pork chops I've ever eaten. Thank you for sharing this. My only reason for leaving out the last star is my belief that there's always room for improvement :-).

This was essentially a very good & tasty recipe. I will definitely make it again but will try it without the white wine vinegar as we found that element a bit overpowering.

This was fantastic. Even my most picky eater enjoyed it. Will definitely be making it again and again.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added minced garlic to the rub for the pork. Paired with roasted garlic & rosemary fingerling potatoes. So good!

It was ok I can eat them with or without the raspberry sauce. Forgot about the fresh Thyme bought it but just used ground spices in place of fresh ones. The oven was never used we just seared them a bit in the pan and I made the raspberry sauce on the side to spoon on top of the chops. They're good, otherwise, it gives the pork a bit of a sweet flavor.

The sauce was wonderful!!! The pork chops prepared as per recipe were tough & dry. Next time I will choose to partially cook my chops by skillet then finish wrapped in foil in the oven. My chops were lovely one inch thick chops. They should have been delicious.

Fast and delicious.  It is even versatile:  I didn't have orange juice, do I submitted lemon juice, but I doubled the it to 4tbsp and eliminated the vinegar.  Also, I replaced the raspberries with strawberry preserves. I think you'll have fun with this recipe and all its variations.

Normally my family isn't too thrilled when I made pork chops, but this recipe made them a HIT!  I used Blackberry jam because thats all I had.  I also followed some of the other reviews and made it with the balsamic vinegar.  It was yummy.  Thanks for this recipe.

I loved the raspberry sauce that worked so well with the pork. I added a bit of garlic to the spice rub and it turned out fantastic!  Will be making this again!

It was delicious. I doused them with thyme and only used butter to cook them. Mine were really thick so I had to adjust cook time. Note:as the sauce cools it turns into a thick syrup, so keep it warm for any second serving requests!

This came out fantastically! I substituted strawberry rhubarb jam for the raspberry because that's what I had around, and that came out great too. I brined my pork chops for a few hours so that they would come out really juicy and that was very successful. The sauce didn't stretch too far for me so you may need to make a bit more than the recipe calls for.

I made this but changed the sauce because I just purchased black cherry infused balsamic while traveling. I didn't realize I paid $17.00 for it until I came home.  I thought the sign said $7.00. melted butter and then my expensive black cherry infused balsamic and then added the pork back into it to coat it. It was great. One more change added some fresh garlic while cooking the pork. Next time will try to add small amount of orange concentrate also. Not sure might be to much?

I loved this recipe!! I was looking for something quick to do with pork chops that was different than the usually breaded or fried. This fit the bill. It was really simple to make. Perfect for a fast weeknight meal but tastes like a special occasion dish. I made as directed but only had 1 cup of white wine. Turned out perfect. The raspberry sauce is so good I could eat it with a spoon. Will definitely be keeping this in my regular meal rotation

This sauce is DOPE! I also put it on my roast potatoes: delish! I will be trying it on pretty much everything. I thought it would be too sweet but the vinegar cuts it so nicely, and finishing it with butter at the end enhances the texture, as someone suggested. Thickens quickly; I don't think it needs more than a minute or so on the simmer.

I've made this a bunch of times. It gets requested regularly. For a more subtle flavor in the sauce, I sub in mirin for the white wine vinegar since it's a sweet vinegar with less sharpness. Delicious!!

Very nice dish. I used six thin chops, I added onion salt, garlic pepper, and parsley to the rub, and I followed the advice of another commentor and rubbed the chops in the morning, and let them set in the refrigerator all day. 

I only had to cook the chops for about three minutes on each side, since they were so thin. I doubled the amount of sauce, as per the advice of others, and added a bit of butter to it.

I served the chops with steamed broccoli and rice, and drizzled the reduction over everything.

All in all, it was a quick, simple, delicious meal with minimal cleanup, which is always a plus.

This is by far my favorite pork dish that I have ever made! The sauce is amazing and pairs perfectly with the pork. All I can say is yummy!!!!!! This will be a weekly dish in my house! The only changes I made were adding a few seasonings to the pork before cooking and using red wine vinegar for the raspberry sauce.

Used the balsamic vinegar and think that helped give it a zingy edge.  Used some seeded jam that I had on hand and it worked fine.  Would like to use this with pork roast, too.  The recipe's a keeper!

I loved this!  Based on other reviews, I used white cooking wine instead of the vinegar.  I also didn't have raspberry jam, so I used apricot/pineapple.  I added a shake or two of red pepper flakes just for fun.  It was great.  I will definitely try with raspberry soon!

Made it! And loved it! I also used balsamic vinegar and I added a Rasberry Jalepeno jelly to this, instead of just regular Rasberry jelly. It was so delicious!! Instead of cooking them in the oven, next time I am going to cook it on the stove only so the pork chop has a sear on the meat. I like a little brown crust on my meats :)

I only decreased the vinegar to 1 Tbsp. Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe indicates, and my husband loved it with the sauce. My picky kids loved the pork chops, but didn't want anything to do with the sauce. Hey, if they're willing to eat the pork chops, I really don't care if they don't like the sauce! They even asked for seconds on the pork chops!
It was so easy to make, and took no time at all. I might try it with chicken, too.

Definitely making this again!   I was apprehensive to put raspberries with pork chops but the results were incredible.  I used bone in thick chops, and couldn't get seedless raspberry jam but didn't affect the end result.  Other than that followed the posted recipe and was awesome! Cook times were spot on.  Thanks so much for posting this!  Its a keeper.

Taste was delicious...but the recipe did not indicate at which setting to cook the pork on the stove..?? I tried MED/MED high for 4 minutes each side, and the pork came out a little on the dry side...will try again on a lower setting.

I made this tonight for some friends and it was awesome. I used raspberry chipotle sauce instead of jam and I sprinkled some garlic powder on the chops as well. The raspberry chipotle sauce gave it a slight zing. Very simple but elegant.

I am not a fan of pork chops, but this was a great recipe.  I doubled the sauce and added some mushrooms.

amazing. we only had regular raspberry preserves (not seedless)... but I didn't notice the seeds at all. instead of white wine vinegar I used 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 red wine vinegar. simply amazing. not too sweet. actually I didn't even really think it was sweet at all. and I cooked each side for 4 minutes, and then kept warm in the oven covered with foil. it did not dry out, and the pork was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. absolutely wonderful!

My family loved this! I used pork chops, since that was what was on sale, and it was really tender and flavorful. My husband was not thrilled when I told him what I was making for dinner, but he quickly changed his tune after just one bite.  A new family favorite!

Made this tonight and it was great! Only took me about twenty minutes and my boyfriend ate it up. I think I'll use a different brand of jam- a little too strong. I put cilantro on top instead of thyme springs because that is what I had. Was worried you wouldn't be able to taste the rub but it was perfect! I will make this again!

This is the second time I've made this, and made a few additions. It is probably the tastiest pork chop dinner I have ever had.

On my stove (LG electric), 4 minutes on each side at setting 7 was PERFECT.

For the sauce, I substituted strawberry jam for the raspberry and balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar. Per another reviewer, I added a pat of butter - that made a deliciously huge difference!

For the rub, per another reviewer, I added 1/4 tsp each rosemary, garlic powder and onion powder to the rub. This also made a big difference.

I love this recipe - fast and easy for a fabulous, restaurant-worthy result.

Just made this tonight, it was yummy. I happened to have raspberry balsamic vinegar on hand so used that instead of wine vinegar.  Also I used homemade raspberry freezer jam WITH seeds, turned out great.  And super easy.

This was a great sauce, I did however make a much smaller batch and it was just perfect! Just a hint of sweet flavor but still allowed the pork to shine through. I will make this again. Thank you for sharing.

This is wonderful! Used fresh thyme in the flour dredge from the garden, and after cooking in a cast iron skillet, made the sauce with raspberry/jalapeño jam, balsamic vinaigrette and the oj, with more fresh thyme. Holy buckets, I could use this sauce on everything, and did! Mashed potatoes, corn, the pork. Thanks for the fantastic idea!

These pork chops where really good.  I used blackberry jam because that's what I had.  I am going to try it with apricot preserves next.  It gives the sweet tooth's in my family a nice break from all my favorite savory dishes!  You can serve the sauce on the side but it isn't really that sweet.  we will make it a repeat!

So tasty!  And used up some ancient jam in the back of the fridge.  Don't judge me.  I changed nothing except added a jug of cabernet on the side.

The sauce is the better half of this recipe. I used strawberry jam (with seeds) and it was good.

The pork chops were very good, they were moist and well seasoned. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, tho. I took advice from others and substituted the raspberry jam for seedless blackberry and used balsamic to try to cut that sweetness to no availe :( will definitely cool the chops the same again tho, I'll just leave out the sauce ;)

This is a very simple dish that allows for minor changes without impact on the overall quality of the dish. I used balsamic vinegar, and finished the sauce with a tablespoon of butter.  It was excellent.

I used bone-in center cut chops for this recipe, because it was what I had on hand. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Great flavor! I love raspberries, so I also used fresh raspberries as a garnish, and that put this right over the top! A keeper for sure. I can't wait to try this with chicken.

Melts in your mouth.  Made just as directed (except used white wine instead of white wine vinegar) and it was a family hit!  Will be making again.  I also plan to try it with chicken as has been suggested.

I thought this recipe was ok, I was a little disappointed with the consistency of the raspberry sauce.  I love all the flavors included in this recipe, but just was not happy with raspberry sauce. I think for the next time I will add cornstarch.  My pork chops were very tough it might have been the cut of the pork chop I purchased, but they were boneless.  I think I will try with chicken like some of the others suggested.

This turned out great and the kids loved it as much as the adults! I made homemade raspberry jam because I didn't have any on hand and it was delicious! I also used a combo of white balsamic vinegar and a balsamic glaze in the sauce because it's what I had on hand. A very easy recipe and something I will add to our rotation.

Easy and very tasty - good way to make a week night feel a little special.  I did cut the vinegar to 1 T and added an extra T of oj.  Will double the recipe for the sauce and try it on pork tenderloin next.

This was fantastic!  I think I cooked the pork chops and additional 5 minutes, just to even the "brown" and to make sure the pork was cooked through all the way.  I added 1.5 tablespoons of raspberry liquor to the sauce.  I let the sauce cool for 5 minutes before "plating" the dish so it would be thicker.

Very, very tasty! I didn't have white wine vinegar so had to substitute red wine vinegar, and I doubled both the herbs and the sauce ingredients.  Loved the results!  I'm cooking only for myself this week, which sometimes seems like more bother than it's worth; but this recipe was fast and easy, and it leaves me with 3 leftover chops for later in the week!  Can't beat it!  I will definitely remember this recipe the next time I'm cooking for guests.

THIS RECIPE GOES IN THE VAULT!  It's a keeper!  I made this tonight for dinner and it was great!  After reading the reviews, I realized I made it with white wine instead of white wine vinegar (only because I read it incorrectly) and it was a perfect accident.  The chops were tender and my family liked the seasoning.  Plus the sauce was delish.  I will use the recipe for this sauce (minus the vinegar)on chicken too and with a chocolate bundt cake.

Really tasty but I agree that the sauce is too vinegar-y, and I even cut it down by 25%.  I used bone-in porkchops and they were great.

The overall flavor of the dish was nice. I just wish the sauce hadn't been as sweet. I did reduce the amount of vinegar, and I actually used apple cider vinegar (I didn't realize I didn't have any white wine vinegar until I was making the sauce.)

I followed the recipe except for using only 1 tablespoon of the white wine vinegar, as others suggested.  It was good... something different.  When I make it again I will try using the full amount of the white wine vinegar.

I have many jars of homemade raspberry jam in my pantry, generously gifted to me by my mother-in-law.  Unfortunately, all of jars contain jam with seeds, but to get the seeds out for this recipe's sauce, I merely combined the jam (doubled quantity, per the other reviewers' recommendations) with the vinegar and juice (original indicated quantities only), microwaved for thirty seconds, then pressed through a flour sifter.  Voila!  Perfect consistency ready to be reduced in the wonderful pan drippings leftover from searing the pork.  The seasoning directions for the pork were spot-on, and lent itself beautifully to rounding out the flavors of the sauce.  Served with simple mashed potatoes, this dish is a winner!  My husband suggested that the sauce should be utilized as a final glazed for our pineapple-soaked, hickory-smoked barbecued pork ribs (which I think is a brilliant idea).

I made according to the instructions except I substituted the white wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar. My family (hubby and kids ages 7, 6 and 3) loved this! Which is saying a lot given that no one in our family really likes pork. I served with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed veggies. Will definitely make again!

I agree, this is worthy of serving company.  I did substitute balsamic for the white wine vinegar.  Mashed potatoes make a good side dish.

These were honestly one of my favorite things I've ever eaten! I substituted balsamic vinegar and used strawberry jam just because that's what I had on hand. But, you MUST pair this with the recipe titled Balsamic Brown Rice Salad (which I didn't add any sugar to and served warm. This recipe is amazing! The spices paired with the sweet yet zingy sauce is to die for!

I liked this recipe, even though I overcooked the pork chops.  The sauce was tasty...I added more raspberry jam due to other reviewers suggestions.  I didn't want it to have an overpowering vinegar taste as others had reported.  I will try this one again and I believe it has the potential for 5 stars...if I don't overcook the pork chops.

Great recipe!  I didn't have orange juice but just mixed sugar free jam with the wine and it was still good. Will try next time with the OJ.  I sautéed onions with it as well. Will definitely make again!

The pork chops were seasoned wonderfully exactly as stated, I even used the leftovers in a salad. The 'sauce' for me came out more like a small blob but I did use plain white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and used the fresh juice from an orange. I'm sure I did something wrong with the sauce! I wouldn't make the sauce again but would definitely make the pork chops.

Made this tonight because I had chops in the freezer and some extra raspberry purée to use up. Loved it!! Husband ate two chops. The only thing I did differently was to brown the chops in the pan and then finish in the oven because they were bone in and thick. Would have never guessed this would be so yum. Added a TBS of butter to the sauce.

Super quick, super delicious.  I think I reduced the sauce too much; upon 5 minutes of cooling, it was almost as thick as the raspberry jam!  Definitely want to try it with fresh raspberry sauce instead once the jam's run out.  Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it, and as quick and easy as it is, it's being added to our regular "rotation" of recipes.

This was good, but I agree with the others who said the vinegar was too overpowering.  I started out with 1 tbsp planning to add the rest if it needed it, but 1 tbsp was already too much.  Next time I will replace it completely with white wine.  But the recipe is definitely worth making again!

It was good. I liked the raspberry sauce, and if I made it again, I would double the sauce. I think it could have used more salt on the pork chop too. It was super easy to make though. Very fast!

Very good! I was hesitant that my husband and kids would like this, but it was a HIT! NO leftovers! I used cranberry instead of raspberry just because I prefer the flavor. Wonderful sweet tangy sauce and savory juicy chops!!

Great recipe! Thank you for submitting it. I will be serving this again for company because it tastes like chops from a quality restaurant. Be sure to double the sauce. I too used the balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine just because I was out of it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh sautéed green beans. Perfect.

This was really good.  If you want to have a bit of kick use the raspberry chipotle jam.  We added about 1/2 regular raspberry jam and the other half was the raspberry chipotle jam.  Yum.  We even added a little bit of the pork drippings in with the sauce too and it was very good!!!

I thought it was very tasty.  I didn't have just dried sage and dried thyme but did have Italian seasoning that had it all in there.  I also did what others suggested and used balsamic vinegar.

Excellent.  I have had a hard time finding a recipe for pork chops that I really like.  We love this one.  I made it just as it is printed.

My friends absolutely loved the sauce. I thought these pork chops were pretty good. I'll most likely try the recipe again at some point because they loved it so much. Next time I think I'll try to thicken the sauce a bit.

The sauce was so delicious. Even my husband, who doesn't like trying new things loved it so much he poured it over his mashed potatoes.  However, my chops came out a little on the chewy side, they might have been too thick or perhaps I over cooked them.  Next time I will try this recipe with skinless chicken breast.

This recipe is a keeper.  I love raspberries and enjoy pork chops a lot as well, but had never thought of putting the two together.  Well, I will use this often.  Both my husband and myself thought this was a keeper!! I did not have any raspberry jam on hand, but did have frozen raspberries.  So tht is what I used in the sauce.  I kept all the ingredients basically the same, except I used 2 - 3 times as many raspberries and thickened the juices a bit by heating with a bit of cornstarch.  I liked this so much, that I don't think I will ever try it with the jam.

This was really good! We had the leftover chops the next day over a salad and used the raspberry sauce as a dressing - definitely the thing to do with these leftovers! Next time I will reduce the sauce more and maybe add a little less vinegar - it was a little runnier than I expected and I wanted a little sweeter taste.

I'm giving this recipe only 3 stars. I made the recipe exactly as stated. The only difference was i used homemade raspberry seeded jam. The chops were really good fried with the seasonings. 5 stars there. However, the sauce was as tasty as what I was hoping for. 2 stars there. So I compromise with 3 stars

Just the right combination of herbs and seasonings. The chops are great even without the sauce. My husband is usually not big on any sauce except BBQ but he loved this and went back for seconds.

This was good - hubby liked it.  May try the sauce next time with red wine vinegar or balsamic.  I didn't have the herbs so I used italian seasoning and some lawry's.  will serve with mashed potatoes and asparagus next time.

as the sauce was a little too sweet for my family's taste I added 1/8 tsp dry mustard as the sauce thickened and let sit for a few minutes.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious but I also doubled up the quantity of sauce.  My 1 year old Grandson also enjoyed it......the chop was minced down of course.

Very good, just wish that they werent fried.  I used bone chops and that was fine but I would suggest making sure you have a thicker chop because they are so good, thin ones will be gone in a second :).  Sauce is thinner than I like though.  Overall taste is great though.

As suggested, I doubled the recipe for the sauce.  Being from Texas (we like things spicy), I added crushed red pepper flakes (about 1/2 tsp.), and reduced the sauce.  I then returned the chops to the pan & covered to steam for about 1 minute and served with fresh steamed broccoli.

This was delicious.  I used fresh herbs and it was such a wonderful flavor.  The sauce was a little runny so next time I will use less orange juice and less vinegar.  Served with red potatoes and steamed green beans. Will def be making this again!

I made one change and reduced the amount of white wine vinegar, and followed the rest of the instructions. The dish tasted wonderful. My picky husband loved it. It's now a dish we'll rotate in the weekly meals. I served with green beans and red potatoes. Delicious! Thank you.

Loved it.  I am a sucker for raspberry sauce on any kind of meat.  This was very easy and quick.  My chops took longer to cook than the recipie states, but they were over 1" thick, so no big deal.  Served with rice and brussle sprouts...yum!  The rice picks up the sauce deliciously.  Will definetley make again.

I made this for the fam tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a small amount of corn starch (mixed in cold water) to slightly thicken up the sauce.  We all enjoyed it, along with strawberry-spinach salad and mashed potatoes.

My husband thought this recipe was great.  However, the sauce was a little too runny for my taste.  It is definitely one I'll try again though.

Delish! I served with Garden Green Beans and mashed potatoes. 

Substitutions: balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and added 2 t soy sauce per another reviewer's recommendation. I think it would be 5 stars originally.

My family really liked this. They didn't like the sauce when the tried it alone, but with the pork it was excellent. I also liked it with my jasmine rice, but my son didn't. I doubled the recipe, but next time I won't. Also, it was really pretty on the plate under the pork. I used raspberry vinegar because I had it. Next time I'll try the white and then balsamic. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is simple and the sauce is scrumptious. We bought thickish pork loin chops so it took more like 20 minutes to cook them. Otherwise, perfect.

This is good but the sauce is a pain. If it starts to cool down it's just how it began- jam like. There must be a better way to make raspberry sauce. Putting that aside we eat this often. I serve with a rice dish & carrots. Thanks.

This is a simple and delicious pork recipe, using items I keep on hand.  I love raspberry jam, but it just didn't seem like it went with the pork that well.  Then again I always make chicken with a raspberry sauce.  I also served with with steamed white rice to soak up some of the excess sauce on the plate.

I will definitely make it again, but I will try it with other jams.

I just cooked this a couple hours ago for the first time. As soon as my boyfriend bit into it he practically screamed, "Wow this is really good!" I almost thought he was being sarcastic he was so excited. :P I didn't think it was DELICIOUS, but I really enjoyed it, and would like to try it again, especially with chicken. I also  didn't get my sauce to thicken up very much, but that is definitely my fault and I know what I did wrong. Thanks for the recipe. =)

I thought this sounded interesting and was pleased with the result.  I followed the recommendations to double the sauce (except the vinegar) and add a little butter to it.  Served with rice.

I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce is amazing, it will thicken as it cools. I would like to try it next with a tenderloin, not sure it I'll fry it whole or slice it. I will definately  make it again with the pork chops.

Raspberry Sauce caught my eye.  I thought just maybe my brother in-law would eat this.  He eats meat, potatoes and corn only! However, he likes raspberry jam.  I made it but doubled the sauce.  When we had finished he said "The sauce was excellent and yes he would eat it again!  WOW!!! That is a high compliment from one finicky eater.

Wow! - One of my rare '5' ratings - mostly because of the exceptionally flavourful sauce. Used thick chops bone-in, (practically 1/2 price of boneless) and raspberry jam with seeds as I've never found a seedless jam.
Will definitely do again!

This is a keeper!  Followed the recipe except used blackberry jam and balsamic vinegar.  Kids liked it, parents liked it, no leftovers.  I did have to cook the pork a little longer in the pan because I used some pretty thick loin chops.  Thanks!

Fair recipe.  Raspberry flavor was light.  Reccomend consideration for more sauce.

The sauce in this recipe is wonderful.  My husband wasn't a big fan, but he says "meat shouldn't be sweet."  If you like fruity dishes like orange chicken or peachy porkchops, then this is one you'll love!  Also looks impressive on the plate...

This was very good. I think I may have used too much raspberry jam, because it was a little too sweet for my taste, but my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it! I will definitely make again but next time use a little less jam, and using another reviewers suggestion, add some butter at the very end. Overall a great recipe!

This was so quick to make.  Definitely a great weeknight dinner. I used a previous suggestion and doubled jam and orange juice for more sauce.

My husband requests this recipe often.  I have made it with both pork chops and a pork loin.  When using a pork loin, I double the spice rub, brown it in the pan, then finish it in the oven.

Great recipe!  Loved the combination of spices on the pork with the tangy, sweet raspberry sauce.  Served with boiled quartered baby potatoes w/ butter & parsley and green beans for full meal.

The sauce is terrific, but I do second the comment about a thicker cut of meat. This just seems to get to dry.

I'll keep this recipe in my box. I love sweets so this sauce was great.  I didn't have any sage, but added onion and garlic powder as suggested.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and seeded jam - tasted great.  Thanks!

I'd probably rate this about a 3.5.  I liked the suggestion of a couple of reviewers, one of whom added a bit of chipotle sauce to heat the raspberry sauce up a bit, and also the person who used OJ concentrate rather than OJ.  I agree with the reviewer who said the meat is a little tough; not bad, but not fall off the bone tender.

I liked this a lot.  The raspberry reduction did have a slight taste of vinegar to me, but I enjoyed it despite that.  It was really easy to make, but I didn't have any sage on hand.

I will try to make the same recipe with chicken!  Thank you for posting

This has such an awesome flavor!  Yum!  I used raspberry jam with the seeds because that is what I had and it turned out great!  I also doubled the sauce and put it in a bowl so we could put it on top instead of on the plate.  I am sure it is good either way.

We all liked this a lot.  The only problem was that the pork chops were a bit on the dry side.  The raspberry sauce is so good, and it's simply delicious paired with pork.  I think I will try this again with better timing of the pork chops.  Thanks for a wonderful dish!

What a wonderfully different way to make pork chops!  I chose it because I love raspberries, and my whole family enjoyed it, including me.  My husband always likes Breaded Pork Chops, and I get tired of that, so I wanted something different, something with a little zing, and I have found it in this recipe!!  It has now become part of my recipe box!

We completely enjoyed this recipe!  I omitted the oil & butter & cooked the chops on the Foreman grill.  I had raspberry jam with seeds but still loved the sauce.  This looks so impressive but was very quick & easy to prepare!!

The pork was tender and flavourful with the spices.  The sauce served under the pork was a big hit with my family.  The raspberry sauce is a great combination with the pork.  I may try the sauce when I grill my pork chops too.   This is a pretty quick and easy recipe...a keeper!

This is a great dish, made it last night exactly as written. The sauce is so good I can imagine using it in many other dishes. It was even good when it ran into the macaroni and cheese we had with it. Next time Im going to put the chops back in the sauce and cook for a few minutes to get them totally covered with sauce before serving, thanks for the recipe

Wonderful!  For once I didn't overcook the pork.  It was a lovely change of pace from the usual applesauce and pork combo.

I was dying for something new to try with pork.  I was not disappointed!  I used triple everything (due to amount of meat) and so far so good, but we'll see if I run out of sauce with leftovers...I am a big sauce person!  I used white wine and a little vinegar in place of the wine vinegar and no fresh herbs.  It was delicious!  Can't wait for DH to try!

This was a wonderful recipe that I just used for the first time for dinner last night.  I turned out fabulous and both my husband and I loved it.  I will definetely make it again, and add it into my favorites collection.  I have also already recommened it to family and friends.  The onlyl things I changed were that I used Boysenberry jam and red wine vinegar becasue those were all I had, it still turned out great and I would love to try it with the raspberry jam to see which one I like best, thanks for sharing!

This was so good!  My first time making pork, and it turned out great.  I followed the suggestion to make extra sauce, and it was plenty.  I also used red wine vinegar (instead of rice vinegar) because that was all I had.  Very good!

This recipe was very easy and very delicious.  I doubled the amount of herbs I rubbed on the outside of the pork chops as well as the amount of rasberry sauce because my family always prefers a little extra sauce and seasoning.  We usually try something different each week so that dinner is not boring, some we "add to the list" and some we don't.  This is one we have definitly added to the list.

Made this last night for DH and myself - it was excellent!  Wonderful blend of flavors - hubby usually doesn't care for vinegar but raved about the sauce - definitely a keeper and next time will follow the suggestion of making double the sauce!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not a big pork eater, but I made this for my family and we all loved it!!  The raspberry sauce is the perfect finish for this.  I doubled the sauce - using 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 balsamic.  It was wonderful.

This is excellent, easy and quick.  I used balsamic vinegar and sugar free raspberry jam with great results.  I did double the ingredients of the sauce to make more, even for just the 4 chops. The sauce is what makes this dish special.

I liked this recipe, it was quick and easy.  I did not add fresh thyme or sage, I used ground sage. Only because I do not like to buy herbs just to use in 1 recipe, that can get expensive.  Next time I make it I will make more sauce because I didn't seem to have enough for leftovers, but I also used 5 chops.  Thanks for the recipe

I used medallions from a pork tenderloin and seasoned them with salt and pepper only.  The raspberry sauce was excellent!!! I doubled the sauce and barely had enough.  My father-in-law raved over it.  Thanks for the recipe!

He liked it!  He really liked it!  My hubby who is a real steak & potatoes guy (and isn't really a good critique for food but I still have to live with him) doesn't really like pork all that much...but he liked this one!  I didn't change anything and I think he really liked the raspberry sauce that was poured over the pork.  Good deal!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I happened to have boysenberry jam on hand instead of the raspberry, came out fantastic, I made sure to seed the jam first though.

OUTSTANDING! I have always looked around for a good pork recipe and now I have found it. I actually would eat this 4 times a week if my middle section would allow. By far the BEST!I felt like I was eating out at a gourmet restaurant except for the lack of clean up crew.I can't thank you enough Coppertopped.

Gourmet food in just minutes! Even my 7 and 5 year ate it because it was sweet. I used raspberry preserves instead of jam and it was still fine.
