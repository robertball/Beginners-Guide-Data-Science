I agree that this definitely needs some sort of dressing, but did enjoy the freshness of the apple against the creaminess of the avocado and earthiness of the beet. Being vegan, I used a vegan aged raw cashew cheese which made this dish a fully raw vegan dish, which was nice. I make a sugar free fat free maple mustard vinaigrette that is to die for that was really nice atop this stack as well. My husband also had trouble deciding how to dig into this, as the previous reviewer mentioned. He picked it up and bit (LOL). I cut into it with a very sharp knife and fork, but fully expected it to collapse like Jenga (it did). But it still tasted nice.

This was very good however,I felt it needed a dressing/vinagrette. Plus I wasn't sure how to eat it! I just chopped it up on the plate. I used feta cheese and toasted pecans. I will make it again, but in a salad form.
