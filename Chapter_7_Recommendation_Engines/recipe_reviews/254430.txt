These were easy to make and tasty! I subbed the cocoa powder for dark chocolate and I added some dark chocolate chips during that last 5 minutes as well.

This recipe is my new favorite dessert  recipe! The batter was really hard to avoid finishing it off before even putting it in the oven (even with the raw eggs) and it is so simple and easy to make!

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. I did not change anything about it. Have made it a few more times and like before it was enjoyed by all.
