We only used the recipe for the sauce (using greek yogurt). We put it on grilled chicken sandwiches. It was ok-would have been much better with the cucumber slices, but we forgot to buy them. Was a little better with some garlic powder.

I love this recipe, but  I find it works better in a Pita pocket instead of on a bun

This is so fresh and tasty...a unique take on a traditional burger! I forgot the cucumber, but I put some lettuce and tomato on top and added extra olives into the yogurt. I also toasted the buns with some olive oil @ 400 (F) for about 10 minutes to make sure they wouldn't get soggy. If you have a george forman or just a grill, make sure to grill the burgers to eliminate extra fat and to add more flavor. I grilled on the onions as well, sooo tasty. I think next time I'll use less yogurt though, since these are very messy to eat.

We made these for a bbq at our house and all of our guests loved them. Some thought they wouldn't like them and they were won over after the first taste. Most of them ate 2 burgers! Definitely a hit and so nice to have something different.

This was a delightful topping to the already yummy veggie burger. It gave it that little extra something, which was a nice change from ketchup & mustard. I don't know why it suggests a pint of yogurt, I used 10.6 oz and it's going to last me for quite a few burgers...

Excellent taste, but the sauce came out thinner than is really convenient for a burger. I'd recommend cutting the yogurt by about a third. Other than that, these were amazing!

I used a Boca burger instead and no bun but flatbread that I had warmed in the mircrowave. I loved the burger so much! It is a great twist on a Greek classic.

Very good and very easy to prepare. WAY to much yogurt sauce and we made 4 veggie burgers and have a ton left over. If I am correct 1 pint equals 2 cups or 16oz?  I think next time I will halve the yogurt but keep all the ingredients that go into it the same.

I made this one night when my bf came over for dinner with the family. Everyone loved it, especially my bf and my little brother. The only thing about this recipe is that the amounts listed for the sauce are WAY off. I was making for quite a large group so I changed the servings and was left with a HUGE bowl of sauce even though everyone used generous portions on their burgers. My recommendation is put in a little of everything and just add more as needed until you have it the way you want it.
