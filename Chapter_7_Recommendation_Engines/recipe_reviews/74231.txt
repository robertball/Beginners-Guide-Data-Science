This was a different burrito. I made a couple of changes to the recipe. First, I didn't use oil to saute but used vegetable stock instead. Second - I thought I had Szechaun Sauce, but it turned out I didn't. I improvised with Hoisin sauce, soy sauce and a little chinese chili paste. I also didn't stir in the cheese, but rather sprinkled a little on top. I think the combination of the asian tastes and the cheese was a little odd, so next time I'll leave off the cheese. This would be good with a variety of cuisines.. use salsa instead of Szechuan and cumin for more mexican burritos, spaghetti sauce and oregano with mozarella for Italian ones.

These were very good. My husband loved them- he said it tasted like the moo shu at his favorite place...which was funny because it wasn't my intention. But, will make again!

My daughter and I loved these - with just a few very minor changes.  To reduce fat & calories, I used Enova oil, La Tortilla Fat Free Tortillas & fat free shredded Cheddar cheese.  Also, I used Emeril's Asian Essence for the spice.  We each had 2 for lunch today and LOVED them.  I wrapped the remaining 4 in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for a quick snack or meal later.  This will be a regular on our menu.  Thanks for a healthy, delicious recipe!!

I greatly enjoyed this recipe for a quick evening meal.  I left off the cheese though -- I felt that would make it too heavy.

For something SO different, these are VERY GOOD.  Since I had 7-1/2 inch tortillas, I made 2/3 of the original amount of filling.  Didn't have the right kind of stir-fry sauce or spice powder, so I improvised with a combo of sweet and sour stir-fry sauce, powdered Oriental stir-fry seasoning mix, and Hoisin and soy sauces.  I made these into true burritos by folding the sides in and over the filling as I rolled each of them up.  Individually wrapped each burrito in plastic wrap so that each of us could nuke one any time.  Only change I would make: next time I would increase the cheese on the top of the filling of each burrito from 1/2-oz. to about 2/3-oz. because it blended in so well that we could not taste it!  I liked how light these were, although Hubby still prefers the heavier Mexican ones.
