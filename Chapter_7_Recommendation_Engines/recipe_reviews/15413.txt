Made the soup for dinner tonight and used several pieces advice from others...added some more garlic, pepper, and oregano.  I also followed the directions someone else gave of halving and seeding the peppers prior to roasting.  This eliminated the need for flipping and turning the peppers. Husband loved it also!

This recipe lacks a bit of flavor, but I dressed it up to make it work. I doubled the garlic, added basil, and one 15-oz can of tomato sauce. It was pretty good after that. [Note:  When roasting the bell peppers, cut them in half first, stem and seed them, then lay them open face down on the baking tray. That way, you don't have to use tongs to flip them in your oven.]

I have been having great fun with this recipe and my family (including 2 year old triplets) doesn't mind at all - they love it! The first time I made it I used a 16oz can of roasted peppers.  I added some things I had in the house like a half empty bag of three cheese tortellini and a bunch of fresh asparagus spears (it looked very pretty).  The second time I roasted my own peppers and it was really good but everyone commented that the difference between the fresh and the canned was so subtle I can get away with not soing the extra work.  This time I only added fresh mini ravioli.  My sisters commented that it didn't really need any additions and I agree. I am making it tonight for a church dinner and I will leave it plain, but I will bring along some crumbled Feta - that sounds so good!  Thanks for a healthy, delicious and versatile recipe!

This was really good, simple and easy to make too!  My peppers may have been small, I'd like a little more of the pepper taste so I may add an extra pepper.  I might even play around and try just a little tomato in it.  Its really good as is though, I sprinkled some baked tortilla strips on top.  Yum Yum Yum!

OK, I had to revise my review.  With my changes....I prefer using great northern beans (not sure why they made a difference to me?) and I used 4 roasted peppers and put in a small can of whole tomatoes.  Perfection!  I also use veggie boullion cube instead of chicken broth as I am a vegetarian.  I love this soup!

Amazing! One of my new favorites. I use a jar of roasted red peppers sometimes for speed instead of roasting them myself. I'll also add a few fresh basil leaves at the end of the pureeing process.

I used a 12 oz. jar of drained sweet roasted red peppers. The soup looked like an elegant soup you'd have at a restaurant.  It was surprising & a nice change to have a creamed soup that was thickened with beans instead of cream. I tried some with a dollop of sour cream on top and some with some with goat cheese (I'd gotten some in a gift basket) on top, as suggested in the recipe, & preferred it without the additions.  It does need some salt & pepper while cooking or at the table.

Excellent taste.  I recommend adding chicken breast chunks.  Roasting the peppers is the hardest part.  I think there are more like 6 servings instead of 3.

This serves six only if you want a little cup of soup.  If you want a big bowl, you need to double the recipe to serve six.  I cut back on the garlic a bit, used Great Northern beans, and garnished with chopped cooked bacon.  Great texture, great flavor.  Everyone loved it!

This soup is so delicious. I highly recommend it for family and especially company.  To cut down on the time, instead of roasting the red bell peppers myself I used roasted red bell peppers from a jar.

This soup is very unique. I added a few basil leaves to the last batch in the blender and it tasted great. I also didn't fully puree all of the soup to give it some texture. I loved it!

The soup is okay but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I added extra bell peppers and lots of spices (thyme, cumin, basil and oregano),  It still needs more flavor to taste good.

This recipe is great! I did make a few additions to amp up the flavor though. I added one carrot to add more color and a sweet flavor. I also added basil and a 1/4 cup of sour cream for a smooth texture. I topped off the soup with goat cheese crumbles and tortilla chips! Delicious!

Wonderful flavor and texture. I used a jar of peppers.  Instead of cans of chicken broth I used chicken boullion.  Based on review I added a dash of oregano. So glad that it contains beans rather than cream.

This is a really good, easy soup. My nine year old daughter loves this soup. Nobody in the household is crazy about bell peppers, but roasting them makes them good, and this soup makes them even better. I'm making this again tonight w/ some shrimp and salad.

This was good, warmed my tummy up. Couldn't find cannellini beans anywhere so subbed in some butter beans. It cooks up very nice and blended well. It does have a little textural issue, but wasn't bad. A little on the bland side for me. Tweaking would only make it better. Thank you for the recipe!

While I enjoyed the roasted red pepper taste, the texture was much too gritty for my liking.  I also had to add extra spices to liven it up.  I must add sour cream does make it much better.  Only three stars because I really was expecting more.

eh...this soup is good, not great. I think it should be named "Bean and Red Pepper Soup". The flavor of the Red Pepper is not very predominant. If I make it again I'll double the amount of Red Bell's. I added some fresh Basil, that helped.

Delicious! I read that some people had a problem with bladness and tossed it. Mine came out wondefully flavourful and thick, and I think the trick is in the proportions. I followed the recipe up to the point when you add the chopped peppers to the onions. Here I added one can of beans in tomato sauce (canned baked beans, basically) and decided that it was beany enough. I threw in 1 and half stock cubes (1 veg, half chicken) because at this stage I thought I'd add all the liquid suggested. But after pouring in a pint of water (volume of one of the cans suggested), it looked thin enough. Blended it, tasted it, added a bit of dried parsley and cumin. Done, wonderful. So, in sum, half the beans, half the broth, a bit of extra flavouring of your choice. A lovely soup really, give it a try.

Pretty good, but not fantastic.  The texture was a little gritty for my taste.  I thought the flavor was great, though.  My 5 yr old loved it, my 3 yr old gagged  :o)

The changes I made upon previous recommendations:
Added 16 oz tomato sauce
Added fresh basil (yum!)
Used vegetable broth instead of chicken
Roasted peppers by cutting in half and placing face down

I'd like to try this recipe again since the flavor was so yummy... but maybe not puree the beans???  If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.

When I roasted 8 red peppers, I also roasted 3 bulbs of garlic and 4 onions cut into quarters. The garlic gives a totally different taste when roasted  and it is not over powering. I did not have any "cannellini beans" so I used 2 cans 19oz of "chick peas" instead. I chopped up some oregano and basil from my garden to add to the soup. All the roasting paid off. It tasted fabulous!

Cannellini beans are hard to find in my area but they are worth the search.

I made this as directed except used veg. broth instead of chicken.  I usually love using beans as the "cream" in soups, but they overpowered mine.  Maybe next time use at least double the peppers?  I added a container of greek yogurt and that helped a bit, but still very beany.  Not bad, just not the red pepper soup I was looking for.

Had a small family get together at our house and made this for a first course to our dinner. Everyone loved it. First time I've ever made this recipe and it turned out fabulous!  I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper...absolutely delicious!!

Very good recipe, I was very happy with the results. I did take suggestions from other reviews (half and seed the peppers before roasting and double the garlic), but I also sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil and 2 tbsp butter, then I also used 4 cups chicken broth which was a little more than the recipe called for. I added 3 fresh sage leaves torn up as well, simmered everything for about 10 minutes then added 1/4 cup of heavy cream after I blended the soup and took it off of the heat. I sprinkled romano cheese on top too. It could use a little spice but very good without it. Very comforting and delicious!

This was a wonderful soup, However that being said the soup did not have a very strong roasted pepper taste and as we love roasted peppers i think next time i will add maybe another two roasted red peppers.  Also we found that a can of fire roasted tomatoes with chilies with a teaspoon of cumin really made this soup sing.  Will for sure make again.

I loved this soup. The only thing I did different was to add 2 drops of Tabasco to give it some zing. I used feta on top and it was wonderful.

I made this soup today and found it very BLAND. I used low sodium broth due to health restrctions. I added basil, Mrs Dash's salt replacement, some ground red pepper, and I feel its still very blah. Any suggestions for a low sodium kick for this recipe? It great having all the protein with no cholesterol in the recipe. Need help adjusting the seasonings

I found this recipe trying to use up some old mini sweet peppers.  I roasted two large peppers, 5 garlic cloves and the peppers and blended all in food processor.  I chopped up celery and sautéed them until soft.  I added 3t salt, a bunch of cracked pepper, basil, oregano, 1 1/2 t cumin, and a bunch of cayenne.  I didn't add any broth.  I think I didn't have enough peppers but it was delish.  I cooked it for a while but eventually added everything to my vitamix for s super smooth soup.  Now I just need a grilled cheese with it!

This was a pretty tasty soup which uses roasted red bell pepper blended with beans for a yummy result. I did a few things differently from the recipe though. I’m not the biggest fan of white beans so I used pinto beans instead which complimented the flavor of the roasted red bell peppers. Vegetable broth was used as opposed to chicken broth and the garlic was doubled. This was really simple to make and only used a couple of ingredients. This was very smooth and nice to have on a cold day.

I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it and wanted seconds! Definitely a hit! 
Based on the reviews, I did make a few modification - I only used one can of beans instead of two, I added a few dashes of oregano and cayenne pepper for a nice kick, and before serving a drizzled the top with a beautiful truffle oil and added a dollop of plain Greek yogourt (a healthier alternative to sour cream). Yum!

I shouldnt rate this only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But the recipe as written sounded a little bland and I didnt have fresh tomatoes. So in its place I used 2 cans - one diced can and one stewed "mexican" can. I also added fresh chopped basil. I also did not use the roux, it seemed like a step it didnt need. Plus, I only had 2 cups of chicken broth  so I used veggie broth for the remainder. But -It was VERY good. I even reserved a small portion of the soup to experiment with and added a little buttermilk to that small portion and it was good as well.  Glad I tried this one!

I tasted the soup before it went into the blender, and the flavor was robust with the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, garlic and onion.  Unfortunately, after it was pureed, the bean flavor just overpowered the peppers.  I found no issue at all with the texture of the soup, it pureed beautifully.  My major criticism is that there simply are too many beans, the pepper flavor is lost, and it ends up flat.  I tweaked it enough that it was salvageable, and I will try this recipe again, but it will be with one can of beans, not two.  My 3-star rating is based on how the recipe is written, but I do think it has potential to be an outstanding soup.

I made this soup this weekend and enjoyed it very much.  Used four peppers and also added two seeded chopped jalapenos, a dash of red chili flakes and cumin.  Will definitely make it again.

I've made this a few times now and I think I like it best tweaked just a tad.   It's very good as is (the 4 star rating is my rating of the recipe as written.)  As much as we loves beans, it just seems too gritty to us even after blending it up really well and then also simmering it down.

I use only 1 can of beans, about 3 cups of water and 2 chicken bullion cubes.  3 very large bell peppers is fine, but 4 is best in my opinion. Onion and garlic the same as the recipe calls for. I also add a big dollop (maybe 3 tablespoons) of reduced fat sour cream at the end.  I think its a lot creamier only using 1 can of beans and the sour cream, and it doesn't add a ton of calories if you only use a little.  We top each bowl with a little fat free sun-dried tomato feta and freshly grated parmesan if we have it.

Like others I wasn't impressed with the texture. The beans have skins on them that don't break down with the blender.  My solutions was to run the finished soup through my old fashioned food mill like I do when making applesauce.  Doing that made this soup so much better.  Adding things into it like sour cream or pesto take it to yet another level.  Very versatile soup.

This soup was really easy and very elegant. I made a few changes: used one can of white beans instead of 2, added some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, and used 4 peppers instead of 3. I used just a splash of cream at the end. When it came to serving it, I topped with some goat cheese and green onions. It looked amazing!  Great recipe!

Yummy soup! The first night I put a dollop of sour cream in it and that was only okay. The next day I added some feta cheese, garlic salt and croutons and it was to DIE for!

I didn't love this soup, but I think it has more to do with the fact that I realized I don't care for roasted red peppers.  It was quite bland, also.  I added some oregano(1/2 tsp.) to it, and then crumbled feta cheese and fresh ground black pepper to my bowl.  It was quite good with those additions.

Pretty good. I added more red bell pepper and fewer beans like others had suggested. I also added some potatoes to thicken it a bit. I'll definitely make again.

It could be my taste but I didn't like this soup.  I just threw out almost a whole pot that I made the other day.  I followed suggestion of others, added cooked chix, added small can diced tomatoes, even fresh basil but I just didn't like it.  Sorry (:

I made this for the first time last night and after dinner caught my husband bent over the stove, scooping the last of the soup from the pot.  He loved it.  

I had loaned our blender to a friend so used a masher to blend everything together after it was cooked.  I think we liked the chunks in the soup much better than having it pureed, but I'll try it both ways and see.  

I served marinated chicken with this soup along with a salad, and during Tom's second helping he cut up his chicken and dropped it into the soup "just to see" what it tasted like.  He LOVED it.  The marinade was Lawry's 30-minute marinade, "Thai Ginger with Lime Juice."  These marinades are FABULOUS.  Another we've had was the "Louisiana Red Pepper" and it's terrific.  We have one more to try called "Tequila Lime with Lime Juice" and I have no doubt it will be delicious as well.  We've only tried the first two on chicken so clearly there's some experimentation that needs to be done!

This bisque was very good. I dont really like peppers, but this is a subtle flavour. I couldnt find the beans required, so i used white kidney beans. I only used a 4th of what was asked for...and still i think the bean flavour was a little overpowering. A very good recipe

It was pretty good but not great.  Roasting the peppers was kind of a pain - the skins were tough to remove except where they were really charred.  Would use canned next time if I make it again.

Awesome! I altered recipe by roasting peppers on my Traeger grill, added 1 can of Rotel, 1 can beans. I puréed using Bullit blender and used 1/2 the amount of broth in addition to 1/2 chipotle spice.

I don’t like prepared roasted peppers, and roasting them yourself in the broiler only adds about 3 minutes to the process. I added a large can of cento brand tomatoes with juice, more garlic, basil, a lot of garlic salt. Used it immersion blender. Stirred in 4 ounces of shredded Gouda right before serving. I was trying to replicate a restaurant dish I’d had earlier in the week. This was pretty close and excellent! Even my kids (ages 3-14) asked for seconds!

Honestly, I found this to be a little bland. I kept trying to fix it with seasoning, and wound up over-salting just trying to wake the flavor up.

This recipe worked up like clockwork.  We found that we sprinkled cilantro and green onion on top after heating and it was even MORE YUMMY.  This will become a family favorite.

I loved it. I made some changes. I add one more clove of garlic. Plus cumin and coriander. According to taste kept putting it till I felt it was right. I served it with melted feta cheese and toasted bread sprinkled with olive oil. It just might be my new favourite soup.

The mistake I made was using cocktail onions that come in a jar. I'm snowed in and was trying to compromise with the ingredients that I did have. Not sure what the recipe is missing, but for all the work I think I will buy this soup off the shelf next time.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because as it's written it's not very flavorful. However it's a good base if you take others suggestions and add in some herbs and season it to your taste. I added oregano and basil as a few reviewers suggested. I also cut the peppers in half, stemmed and seeded them before roasting. I used an immersion blender to blend the soup in the pot.

I seldom make changes the first time I make something, but in this case I did substitute pinto beans. I also added two jalapeno peppers to give it a little subtle zing. My peppers were a little small and so I used four of them. Definitely will make it again.

As is this recipe is very bland.  I did have to trade out the chicken broth for veggie broth since my husband is a vegetarian.  I used the suggesteions already posted, but also added a can of roasted tomatoes, 1tsp each of thyme, oregano, basil, paprika and black pepper.  After that my family loved it.

I must say after making this now twice, it just is surprising how good it is. I would never have thought of,this as just a meal on its own, but it is very filling. The first time I used half the beans and it was a bit thin. The second time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. A definite redo.

Very simple and tasty recipe. 
Couple things I might do differently - run through a sieve since it was a little gritty. I'm pretty sure that it's caused from the peppers but it could be a combination of the peppers and the beans. Secondly, I would add a little paprika or powdered chipotle to just give it a "little something".

This was amazing, and easy to make.  I made one alteration: I used a stew spice mix with oregano, garlic powder, paprika, and thyme, among others.  This recipe was great, I made it for my Argentinean host family, who don't eat spicy food and tend to be bland.  They loved this recipe.  10 out of 10.

Fantastic.  I pureed 3/4 of the soup and rather than doing the rest, I left the beans and the small pieces of peppers to give the soup a little more texture.   Followed some previous reviews and added a little oregano and more garlic.  Also added a dash of chili powder.  This really is a great recipe.  Definitely a repeat in this household.

This was ok. I roasted and skinned the peppers, used only 1 can of beans. Strained it well (we like cream soups with no chuncks), added 2 tbs heavy cream and one 5 oz can of fat free evaporated milk to cut back on fat/calories. Not sure if I will make it again, but still glad I tried it.

ok.  i should have read the reviews first.  i made the soup (navy beans instead of cannellini beans, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth) - and i hate it.
it's bland and the texture is horrible!
so far, to try to remedy the soup i've added more garlic, tomato sauce, a tomato, celery, basil, and a half of a yellow pepper.  Now I've got a very garlicy, kind of tomato-y soup that still has a horrible texture.
Not a big fan of this one.

This had good flavor, and I like the idea of using beans to give the soup a creamy texture. It was a touch too beany for my taste, though--next time, I'll reduce the beans and increase the peppers. The only change I made is to use vegetable broth instead of chicken. This is a very filling soup.

I really loved this soup.  I used two red bell peppers and one yellow - it seemed to work just fine.  I also only put half of the soup into the blender, after reading some reviews that it might be better that way.  YUM!

I was not impressed with this receipe.  It lacked flavor.  I added cheese tortellini and asparagus but it didn't help.
