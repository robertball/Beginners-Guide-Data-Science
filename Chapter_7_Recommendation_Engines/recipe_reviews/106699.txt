Yum yum yum! My husband and I made this three days ago and adored it.  So much so that I am making it again tonight!  I cut the jalapenos in half when I made it, but I am going full strength this time.  We thought it could handle the extra heat.  I used the salmon "filet mignon" cut that is very easy to grill.  Served it with grilled veggies and the Japanese rice from this site.  Used the left over sauce on the rice! To die for.  Tonight I am going to put the salmon on some romaine lettuce with a loaf of french bread.  Perfect for a summer night!

This is by far the best grilled salmon recipe I've tried from this site. Loved the sauce! Thanks!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  It blew us away.  My mother-in-law doesn't like spicy, and doesn't like salmon, and even she loved it!  I didn't have time to roast the garlic, so I used only three cloves of raw garlic, and probably less than a cup of mayo.  This spread would go great on lots of things!  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

We replaced two of the jalapenos with Fresno Red peppers, almost doubled the roasted garlic and added a healthy dose of pepper and salt.  We used Coho salmon.    I didn't flip it on the grill, which allowed the sauce to crisp up nicely on one side, which made it look great.  Sauce is a much better word than marinade for this recipe.    Push it with the spatula and when the fish separates from the skin, it's done.  You can test it that way without breaking the crust and damaging presentation.  The mayo makes the peppers chill out a bit more than we expected.  My wife and I like a kick to our food, so next time, I'll switch all the peppers for Habaneros and add a lemon.     We made the entire sauce, but only two fillets.  I'm gonna use it to bread and bake chicken.

I made this thought it was okay...I think the horseradish is what turned me off a bit, next time i will make it with less horseradish.

great...not sure i kept the exact recipe ratios, but added a little lime and cilantro as well- the lime helps keep the spiciness down a little.  I pan roasted the garlic and jalepenos- very unique and just what we were looking for!

Excellent flavor, we absolutely loved it. I did reduce the amount of garlic by a bit, and it was perfect-- not too spicy, and you can still taste the salmon flavor. Thanks for the recipe, it'll go in our keeper file!

We love hot and spicy, so this recipe fit perfectly with our family and guests!  Next time I'll replace a jalapeno with a habanero to increase the heat.

Delicious! I baked this dish instead of grilling. My 'I'm not a seafood fan' boyfriend even liked it!

Turned out delicious. Halfway through I realized that my horseradish had expired and so I made a simple garlicky aoli to go with it and people loved it.Thanks for a great idea. Oh, I did reduce the heat quite a bit too.

Thought his sause was delicious, I roasted the jalepenos as well as the garlic and added lot's of black pepper. Spread it atop of toast rounds and added the grilled salmon, makes wonderful appetizers. I think the sause would be fantastic as a tarter sauce on any type of fish sandwich or soft taco or on  a chicken or turky burger.

It was actually really good. I pan seared it because I don't have a grill, and I added some lime juice to get rid of the fishy smell, but overall it was extremely good. I couldn't taste the jalapenos at all! (great because I can't do spice) It was though a little bland, and could have used some salt and other spices maybe.

I've actually made this about 2 gazillion times. The sauce is quite flexible in its construction and is great on almost anything!

I like fish, but usually don't LOVE it.  My husband wants to eat more fish, so I have been trying new grilled fish recipes.  I will have a small portion, and he will take leftovers for lunch.  When I tried this recipe, I was stunned at how the tastes blended into an awesome flavor blend.  I had seconds and I even had leftovers for lunch.  Best recipe ever!!  I can't wait make it again.  I did add just a pinch of salt and I might try yogurt instead of mayo for calorie reduction.

This was an OK dish but I was looking forward to spicy and didn't get it at all.  Next time I won't seed the jalapenos and/or perhaps add some cayenne to the sauce.   The sauce was flavorful in itself and it was a simple meal to make.
