The only thing I did different with this recipe is add an 8 oz can tomato sauce instead of  the tomato paste. I was out of paste. I ended up adding another 8 oz tomato sauce at the end to thin it a little. It was a big hit. Our meat eating guest didn't even notice there wasn't any in it. It was perfect for my dad who doesn't like things too spicy. The rest of us passed the ghost pepper powder and the reaper sauce, but we like things crazy hot. Will definitely continue to make this recipe.

Delicious and filling.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes.  I also added cilantro for a little extra kick.

Amazing, my family and I love this recipe. I love it as a vegan meal or sometimes I throw in leftover rotisserie chicken too, so versatile!

Chili was awesome! Even my meat loving husband loved it. I replaced the red and green peppers with sweet corn, beets and carrots.

Perfect! I doubled the the recipe, sharing with 6 people and I wanted to last a couple days through this cold winter (12/1/18 11 Degrees) I didn’t double the jalapeño pepper and it still had a bit of a kick since I sprinkle in Old Bay to pretty much ever thing I make. I also did not rise off the beans. I purchased Goya and they were so tasty out the can, I didn’t understand the need to rise. Overall my family loved the recipe; placed in bowls over some balsamic rice and it was perfect.

I am not vegetarian but I had a friend coming for dinner who is vegetarian and vegan and glucose tolerant yikes!! I scrambled trying to find a recipe I could make. I found this chili and we ALL absolutely loved it!! I made according to the recipe. The longer you simmer it the better it tastes. I let mine simmer for 4 hrs and it was honestly the best chili I have had in a long time. And it’s meat free!!

Reviewer Tracey was right. This recipe appeared in the magazine with the name Vegetarian Chili. In place of the 28 oz can of tomatoes, I used a 14 oz size of fire-roasted tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce (not crazy about a lot of tomato chunks). I also subbed small red beans for the chickpeas. The spices came together for excellent flavor with just the right amount of heat. You would never know there is not meat here. Topped with cheddar cheese and scallions. Yummy recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!  As soon as I saw it in my AR Magazine this month, I KNEW I just had to make this.
Before I go any further, this recipe is NOT listed correctly in the magazine.  The name in the article is vegetarian chili.  I have been searching the link and the site for this recipe, but it wasn't until II shared my picture and the link from the article that I was able to find this, under a different name...
Whatever, this is a great recipe.   The only thing I did differently was I used dried black beans because I didn't have any canned, but that's it.  It was so easy and the results were delicious!  I love how the recipe called for 3 different kinds of beans because I think that is the reason you won't miss the meat.  Just a great recipe all around :-)

I did not use Jalapeno and the garlic but it was just as delicious. Used Chipotle red beans instead of Garbanzo beans. My family loved it. Thanks I will make it again.

This chili turned out great!  I did not put the chickpeas in but instead put more kidney beans in.  I also reduced the water to just 1 cup.

Turned out great. I did not follow the recipe exactly, adding and omitting some ingredients based on what my family likes and what I had in the refrigerator and pantry. But overall, was delicious.

Very tasty! Made double the portion, but only used 1 jalapeno. Also added some sweet corn to the dish. Will be making this again for sure in the upcoming winter months!

Made this while on a no meat, no dairy plan. Loved it! Did leave out the jalapeno so the kid would eat it and subbed pinto for the chickpeas. Will make again!

Sadly I was very disappointed in this recipe. I will not be making it again.  Even though we love beans soup, the spices were just off.

This three-bean veggie chili is EXCELLENT!   I used vegetable broth, instead of water; otherwise, followed the recipe, to the letter!  SOOOOOOO yummy!  Thank you!

I don't like tomato paste so I left that out .  I'm not a vegetarian but thought I'd take a break from meat and gotta say this was absolutely delicious!  Did not miss the meat.

I added some extra chilli and sweetcorn, it needed a little something and I reduced the amount of tomato paste and water as that would have been too overpowering in my opinion but over all it was lovely! 
Went down well with my dad who is a meat in every meal kind of Man!

Made this today. It was really easy. Did not use the jalapeño or chili. Used 2 cups water and the full can of tomato paste and it was thick enough. Will definitely make it again! ??
