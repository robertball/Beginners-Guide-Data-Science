Everyone seems to like this one. We have had a similar recipe in our family for years with the following changes:  increase the butter by adding 1/2 cup of melted butter to the potato mixture and 1/4 cup melted butter mixed with the cornflake topping; 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (instead of chicken); 8 oz cheese; one small diced onion (instead of flakes) and 2 cups of crushed cornflakes for topping.  The rest is the same although I usually bake it closer to an hour.  I know the fat content just more than quadrupled but it's soooooo good.

This turned out really good, I made a few changes to the recipe, it's just my nature.  I did 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken, I diced up 1/4 of an onion, upped the cheese to 8oz, and upped the butter to 4tbl. I also added 4tbl of melted butter to the cornflakes. I didn't crush the flakes, and added roughly 2 cups of cornflakes with the melted butter mixed in. Turned out great, and golden!

Use real onion 1/2 to 1 c diced and sauted in small amount of oil or butter until transparent (quantity depends on how much you like onions, I like a lot and I also add a clove of crushed garlic to the onions in the last 2 minutes of sauteing.) The recipe needs a lot more cheese than that in my opinion, I put in at least a cup and a half (I like cojack best.)Also I like this best with chopped ham added. When I make it my way it gets raves at our church breakfast potlucks...

This was delicious!

I did tweak based on reviews though of it beling not cheesy enough and/or too dry.  Here's what I did:

* full 2 c. cheese in mix
* used only 3/4 pkg of hashbrowns
* used one cr. chicken soup and one cr. celery
* added some 1/2 & 1/2 to mixture 
* used parmesean bread crumbs instead of cornflakes

I love this recipe.  I was looking for a hashbrown casserole recipe for Thanksgiving and found this one.  I am so glad I did.  It was wonderful.  It was very easy and tasted just like the ones my aunts used to make.  I used a chopped onion instead of dry onion. I think it gave it a real kick.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is very good, although I left out the butter and use the Cream of Chicken Healthy Campbell's soups.  I have used a recipe like this over the years and I brown a pound of gound chuck, 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 of an onion.  We call it cheeseburger hashbrown casserole.  We have also added polish sausage in the past instead of the hamburger.

Great recipe.  I also, like many others added more cheese.  I also split the recipe for just my husband and me.  I added half a pack of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  Instead of the cornflakes, I crushed up cheese and garlic croutons.  Will definitely make again!

Been making this for years. Many requests for this dish. My mother in law taught it to me. This is one of those dishes that looks like you slaved over it but its actauly pretty simple.  Only changes, I use only 1 can cream of chicken. 8 oz  sour cream. 2 C  shred sharp cheddar.  I always use real red onion..1/4 cup. Have also added bacon on occasion and sometimes use the cubed frozen hash browns instead of the shredded. We love French fried onions. So , I top with those instead of corn flakes. Going to make a batch right now ..yum!

I added 1 can of cream of chicken 1 can of condensed cheddar cheese and used ritz crackers instead of cornflakes. Boyfriend thought it was great. I thought the hashbrowns could have been more crispy.next time I will cook the hashbrowns golden then mix with the ingredients and bake til the sauce is heated and see if it turns out better. BF said it was perfect just the way it was!

This made a good basic side that everyone seemed to enjoy.  I did make a few changes, however: I replaced one can of soup with cream of mushroom, used fresh sauteed onion instead of flakes, and added a clove of minched garlic, about four extra ounces of cheddar, and a pound of browned sausage.  It needed all the flavor these additions gave it.  I made one batch immediately in the oven and it was kind of bland.  I put the other batch in my crockpot and set it in the fridge for two days (frozen potatoes and all-- they thawed while in there) and cooked it for about four hours on low.  It turned out MUCH creamier and more flavorful.  I crushed croutons in melted butter for the topping.  Thanks for the recipe! I'd make it again for a group.

This recipe is a keeper!  I always use a large shallow baking dish and cut the sour cream to 1/2 c. and instead of putting the 2 T butter in the dish along with the soup mix..I melt it first and stir in the corn flakes before putting them on top. (It helps the topping stay crunchy) This is a great recipe to add some ingredients to and make it your own.  I've exchanged 1 can cream of mushroom, cream of potato or celery for one cream of chicken, used a real onion, added a few dashes of tabasco sauce or 1/2 t. cajun seasoning (it really wakes up the flavor) and also added 2 rashers crumbled bacon.  Louise, thanks for sharing this wonderfully creamy side dish!

This is a wonderful side dish!!!  My husband always volunteers it for his work and at cookouts. (Of course I'm the one who cooks it...lol)  I like to use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of chicken.  I also use frozen hashbrowns, extra cheese, use a little more melted butter, and I add melted butter to the corn flakes...this makes a nice buttery, crunchy topping. (The flakes get soggy reheated, but usually, there are no leftovers.)  Great dish, and very easy.

This recipe was good but I decided to change a few things:  w/ 2lbs of hash browns, I only used 12 oz of Cream of Chicken, omitted the butter, used fresh diced onions, added 4 oz crumbled bacon & 4 oz cooked breakfast sausage meat. Instead of cornflakes, I substituted it for Panko breadcrumbs for a lighter crisp. The result? A dish that has everything you could hope for in breakfast, it was very filling and tasty. Best part is, those that I've made this for found it "addicting."

Delicious and very easy to make!  I did make the following changes:  2 c. chicken flavored white sauce instead of the soup, I doubled the amount of cheese and also used crushed cheddar chex mix for the topping instead of the corn flakes.  Will definitely be making this again!

Not bad with a few alterations. I liked that this recipe didn't require a ton of butter, like some other hashbrown casserole recipes. I scaled this recipe for 5 servings, left out the cornflakes, used real diced onions, added 1/2 pound more hashbrowns, and 6 more ounces of cheese. I also mixed in 1/2 pound browned sausage. I made this with low fat sour cream and reduced fat cheese, and it was certainly rich enough. I didn't expect the hashbrowns to get crispy at all (considering the wet ingredients), but if I make this again, I might experiment with frying the hashbrowns in a little olive oil first and reducing the cook time of the casserole to see if I could get them to come out on the crispy side.

This is the 3rd hashbrown casserole recipes I have tried from this site and DEFINITELY the best. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. For a recent holiday party, I baked them in the oven at home using my croc pot's stoneware then let them sit on low at the event for an hour before we ate - they were just as good, if not better after melting and melding for a while. Thanks for a great EASY recipe my family enjoys.

So good.. always reminds me of the Holidays! I made this the other night and the only thing I changed was omitting the onion (per taste) and maybe adding a little extra cheese on top. Definitely a winner for any occasion!

This was a great and quick way to add a little bit more to my holiday meal. It took almost no prep time, and came out delicious! I was asked for the recipe twice. *g*

Great recipe! I doubled the cheese and used french fried onions instead of corn flakes.

Very tasty comfort food. 

 I chopped a small yellow onion and sauteed in the butter instead of the dried minced.  Also added diced green and red pepper to the the onion and sauteed. 

Definitely added more cheese then called for and used Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes. 

Used low fat cream of celery instead of mushroom, also used low fat sour cream. 

My boyfriend loved it.   I will make this again.

This was very good! I did double the cheese, and I used ritz crackers on top though, just because we would never eat the whole box of cornflakes...

Really excellent dish. The ingredients are spot on. I did top mine with crushed potato chips in place of cornflake crumbs, just for some extra flavor.

Had this with our meatloaf last night and it was delightful!  I didn't have the full two pounds of hashbrowns  so I used one can of soup, sour cream with chives, no butter, fresh onions, salt and pepper, hot pepper and topped with crushed ritz crackers.  The family really liked it. I think next time I will add some ham and have supper in one dish.  This recipe can be done to personal likes with all different ingredients. Thanks!!

This was exactly what I was hoping for!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!  It went perfectly with ham.  I tried topping with cheez-its but wouldn't recommend it since they're a little too obvious.

I used light sour cream and reduced fat condensed cream of chicken.  It came out great even without all the fat.  It may have done the dish good to add some ham and green onions.  Maybe instead of cream of chicken, I could add condensed cheddar soup.  It might bring out more flavor.  Like some others, I had to bake this in the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes.

I halved the recipe and used cream of broccoli soup, so maybe that was the problem.  This was okay, nothing great.  Hubby and kids put kethup on theirs, which i think is a bit of an insult, but it was a good side with baked ham and veggies.

WOW!! Now that was great! They asked for more. 
I didn't have corn flakes, so I let the kids crush up some snack crackers in a ziplock instead. 
And I didn't have shredded hashbrowns, so we used diced potatoes. 
Thank you!
Donna  :o)

I've always loved hashbrown casserole, and this was the recipe I was looking for when I decided to make it for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it, and I thought it was okay.  Next time, I'll cook the hashbrowns a little first because they were crunchy.  It was also a little dry.  Next time, I'll add some chicken broth.  Overall, though, it was good.

this was pretty good, but when i asked my guests for feedback, at least two of them said 'it needed something'. i agreed, but im not sure what--maybe more cornflakes. also, i doubled the amount of cheese in the recipe and still felt it could've used more. and, as someone else mentioned, it took a lot longer to cook than the recipe stated..by the time it came out of the oven, everyone was almost finished eating. regardless, it was still pretty tasty and i'll probably make it again, but will probably tweak the recipe a little more next time..

I love hashbrown casserole, but this was not my favorite recipe. I think it was the cream of chicken soup that I didn't care for, next time will try a different cream soup, maybe cheese.

This recipe is so easy to prepare, it's great for potlucks.  Make sure to take copies of the recipe, people will ask.
The only thing that I do diffrently from the recipe is that I use the cubed style hashbrowns instead of the shredded, I also sauted a whole (med) diced onion in the 2 Tbs. of butter until translucent

This was a hit at our Christmas gathering! I added a can of cream of celery as well as the 2 cans cream of chicken. Also doubled the amt of cheese, added half container of philly savory garlic cream and used buttery crackers as topping. It was sinfully delicious!!

This was pretty good! I didn't add sour cream bc we don't like it and just added some milk. Also added sausage and will try with hamburger meat next time. I halved the recipe and also added a few extra seasonings.

Nice recipe that lends itself to variation. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used only 3/4 of the hash browns (we only needed to serve 4 people), and replaced the cream of chicken with 1 can of celery and one of mushroom as I didn't have the cream of chicken. I also reduced the sour cream (non-fat) to about 3/4 cup, replaced the onion flakes with 1 small onion diced and sauteed in butter, along with about 1/4 red pepper diced and sauteed. Instead of adding the butter in the recipe, I splashed in some half and half cream for extra liquid. Like others I increased the sharp Cheddar and because my family doesn't like corn flakes, used Panko bread crumbs with a little grated parmesan and a little melted butter drizzled on top. Forgot the pepper so had to add it on my plate.  I would have liked the corn flakes myself. I broiled the top a little to brown it. Next time I will add some mushrooms and see how it tastes.

I really like this recipe.  We changed it up by using cream of mushroom soup and wheaties or total on the top instead of corn flakes.  It makes it just a little richer.  We also use a cheese blend instead of just the sharp cheddar cheese.  YUMMY!

THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!! Even my super picky 17 month old LOVED it! I made it dairy-free and substituted the cream of chicken soup for my own homemade "soup." Here's what I did (I only made half the recipe and used an 8x8 pan): I melted 3 tbsp. butter over med heat. Then added 3 tbsp whole wheat flour and 1/4 water and a bouillon cube. I let it get thick and I added a bit of rice milk (you could use any milk). I used that instead of the cream of chicken soup. Then I used dairy free sour cream and soy cheese. I cannot get over how AWESOME it was! I want more!!!

Made this for Bruch on Christmas morning.  What was nice was that I made it the night before and put it in the fridge.  I didn't have any leftovers! I have also made this as a mid week side dish, my whole family likes it.  But it's hard on the wast line.  I have subbed w/ low fat/fat free ingredients (cheese soup, sour cream etc) and no one noticed the difference.  A great recipe!

This was so easy to make, it tasted like a loaded backed potato, I didn't add the corn flakes as a topping i used bread crumbs instead and added some bacon bits.

This was ok. I don't think I'm crazy about using condensed chicken soup if there is no chicken in the recipe. I would make this again but I'd use a vegetarian soup like maybe cream of celery or cream of onion/mushroom. Its just weird to have a chicken flavor to something that contains no chicken.

I made this as an extra side dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was such a hit it was gone before the usually popular mashed potatoes!  The only changes were that I used freshly diced onion and because I didn't have cereal, crushed tortilla chips to use on top--very good and crispy!  I will be making this again.  Thank you.

I only used one can of cream of chicken soup and about 3/4 of a cup of sour cream, but I doubled the cheese.  Also, I didn't have any cornflakes, so I used rice crispies.  Just tossed them with a couple tablespoons of melted butter and a little garlic powder (they still go "Snap, Crackle, Pop" even when you pour butter on them).  This worked out very well and we all enjoyed this casserole very much.  I served it with meatloaf and sugar snap peas with mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe - although I've never actually made it with frozen hash browns.  I always seem to make it on a whim when I only have potatoes, so I usually make 8 baked potatoes (with the skin on) in the microwave (arrange like bicycle spokes, cook 6-8 minutes, turn the potatoes over, cook 6-8 more minutes, and make sure to pierce the potatoes!)  I let them cool just a bit, then grate them with a cheese grater.  Most of the skin will naturally come off as you grate, and the little bit that doesn't just adds a nice color to the mix.  I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  It is fabulous!!

I loved this recipe with BBQ chicken. I doubled the cheese and drissled the melted butter over the top as noted.  Campbell has a cream of chicken and mushroom soup combined that I used. I also used a little more corn flakes.

This is sooooo yummy. I accidently bought hashbrowns with peppers and onions and really feel that's what made the dish. I took this dish to a birthday potluck. It was gone so fast and everybody commented on the zing. Will definately make again. Thanks.

Rave reviews on Xmas morning!  For a lower fat version I used low fat soup and added a bit of fat free half and half for the cream.  I think next time I might try cream of mushroom or celery instead.  I ended up with chicken in a couple of bites.

This is a great stand-alone recipe, but for a complete meal, I added diced chicken, broccoli, celery and carrots, but only 1# of potatoes because of the additions.  I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I used 1 can each of cream of celery and broccoli.  Turned out great!  Great recipe!

My family has made a similar recipe for years.  Instead of Cream of Chicken soup we use Cream of mushroom.  And the whole thing gets coated in bacon bits instead of cornflakes.  It is a favourite at potlucks and picknicks or as a fast and easy side dish to any meal.

I usually make this recipe for Easter Brunch and again for a New Year's Day Brunch.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's WAY too high in fat and cholesterol to make regularly. However, for a special treat it is SO YUMMY!  I use the "O'brien" style hashbrowns -- the ones that come with minced onion and red & green bell pepper already included.  They add extra flavor and color (but not any extra effort!)  This is SO good with sliced ham, and it always gets raves from my guests.  CHEERS and Happy New Year to everyone!

Made this for Christmas brunch & it was very good.  Almost no leftovers.  Added crumbled bacon and used one can cream of chicken & one can cr. of potato.  Added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and paprika to the soup/potato mixture. Didn't use the cornflakes, they didn't sound good with sharp cheddar but might try it next time, since even though this was very tasty it still seemed to be lacking 'something' that I couldn't put my finger on.  Thanks for the recipe - will try it again & play around with the ingredients.

This recipe was great!!!!  The only thing I changed in the recipe was the onions.  I added 1/2 cup onions instead of 2 tablespoons minced onions.   I took this to an office breakfast and it took off!!!   Everyone was asking for the recipe.  At least 10 to 12 people.  For the people who made this and it did not come out right, they had to make a mistake somewhere along the way.  This is the best.  Definitely a keepsake.

Sorry... this recipe was gross. I tried all of the changes suggested - more cheese, real onion, and it still was tasteless. Good thing I had a salad and rolls for fillers since my family left 3/4's of the dish on the table.  This is one dish that shows not much went into preparation from the way it tasted.

Delicious!  My company loved this recipe.  I used a combination of both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  I also substituted 2 tablespoons of very finely minced sweet onion instead of the dried onion.  I also added a little bit of bacon fat (very fattening, but so good!) and sprinkled the crumbled bacon on top with the corn flakes.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe.  I find that doubling the cheese int the casserole and also doubling the corn flakes improves the end result.

This was ok, but not what I expected.  Not creamy at all, just kind-of spiffy hashbrowns.  I probably will not make again, but only because I'm looking for something more dramatic.

EXCELLENT, EASY AND A REAL WINNER. I DID NOT HAVE ANY SOUR CREAM, SO I ADDED 2 EGGS AND 5 TBSP OF MILK.I ADDED SOME CHOPPED HAM ALSO.  DELICIOUS, WILL PROBABLY BECOME A TRADITION FOR OUR LEFT OVER HAM FOR NOW ON.

I just made this, I 1.5 the recipe, only used mushroom soup, I didn't use shredded hashbrowns , I used the smaller diced ones, used dried onions instead of fresh (easier to hide from my picky eaters). Used aged and med cheddar and added 3/4 package of dry ranch dressing.  I cooked it all in a 9 X 13 inch pan for 40 min and uncovered it and baked another 35 minutes. I had everyone comment how wonderful this dish was. I will make it again next christmas with my pineapple glazed ham and my triple sized sweet potato casserole. Excellent.

My Family absolutely loved this recipe!!! I did make a few tweaks that I think increased the flavor. Instead of onion flakes, I sauted about half of an onion in a little oil and added that. I also did one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and one can of Cheddar Cheese Soup and increased the sour cream to two cups. I then baked it for 45 mins at 325 and then upped the temp to 350 and baked for another 20 mins. It turned out perfect!!! Crispy on the top and cheesy and delish!!

I made this for a group of friends coming over for dinner and for father's day (the next day). So I doubled the recipe, and made two casseroles at once. My friends and my family all loved it and asked for the recipe afterwards. I made a few changes to it: instead of onion flakes, I minced real onions and sauteed them until golden brown (about 1 large onion for two recipes). I also substituted the sour cream for greek yogurt (plain). The consistency is exactly the same, the flavour is very close, but greek yogurt is WAY healthier. Also, instead of corn flakes I used Panko bread crumbs on top. It turned out delicious, and I'm definitely doing this recipe again.

@ Guza... The problem you are having with it tasting like feet at times could be the potatoes you are using. The recipe calls for the hashbrowns to be thawed but if they are left out or in the refrigerator too long they spoil quickly when not cooked. Just a thought...

Very easy and VERY good!  I add ham and peas.  I substitute 2 cups fat free Greek yogurt (more than the sour cream to accommodate for the extra ingredients.

This was an excellent reciepe. I have made one similar before however I add more cheese, I do one can of cr. chicken and one of cr. mushroom. I also at a can of rotel and velveta. I also use ground hamburger meat to it. It's almost like mexican chicken but with beef and hashbrowns. My kids love it this way and it has been a big hit at pot luck dinners and such. It's a regualar at my house.

It was good.  I added more cheese than the recipe and still thought it needed more cheese.  It was more creamy than cheesy.  I also used fat free soup (one cream of chicken and one cream of celery) and fat free sour cream.  I also used real onion.  My guests asked for the recipe so that must mean something.

My son's girlfriend and I loved this casserole but the men were not impressed.  I made exactly as recipe states except didn't measure cheese, I just eyeballed what looked right. I halved the recipe and didn't measure the corn flakes but used a single serve box and it was the perfect amount.   I say delicious!  My husband ended up loving the leftovers when heated up in our toaster oven.

Great tasting recipe! I didn't have any cornflakes so I used French's fried onions. Tasted great. Next time I will try it with Low Fat Cream of Chicken, and Fat Free Sour Cream to cut down on the fat.

Perfect and a crowd pleaser! I used cubed frozen potatoes, and just as good as regular style hashbrowns. Used 1 can crm of celery and 1 can crm chicken and no cornflake topping. Make lots - people will not stop eating this...

My mother has made this recipe for years and always gets rave reviews. I needed to make it one day and knew I'd find it here :) It turned out perfect. I opted for real onion and I didn't measure cheese or corn flakes, just used whatever amount covered the dish.

Was very good.  Just added more cheese and less hash browns and it turned out great.  Used only about 1 1/2lb of hash browns and roughly 6oz of cheese.  I also did not use minced onions but instead used 1 TBSP of powdered onion!! Worked great and my family loved it!!

This was REALLY good... but I think it would be bland without the changes I made, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  I'm a vegetarian, so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, i sauteed a cup of red/green peppers and a cup of onion, with a couple cloves of garlic... it really needed this as it gives the dish all of its kick.  I added a bit more cheese and it was delicious!  My boyfriend likes some meat in his meals, and being veg, I won't cook any meat in a dish, even if it's in "his half".  So I make a scrambled egg with pieces of ham and throw it on top of his piece and he LOVES it!!

This was really good and easy.  I work with young kids and they were able to help out with this with out it being complicated, although next time I am going to add more cheese and garlic.

I loved this! I agree that it is very much like the casserole at Cracker Barrel. I left off the cornklakes and added extra cheese. I also sauteed diced onion in the butter instead of the flakes. To decrease fat I used fat free sour cream and fat free cream of chicken. It at least made me feel a little less guilty!

Really good dish!  I changed a couple of things based on what I had.  I only had one can of cream of chicken so I used one call of cream of celery as well.  And, instead of cornflakes I topped it with a can of fried onions.  It turned out great and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks!

This needs at least double the cheese and I used half of an onion, chopped. My husband loved it. I will be making this again.

Great taste, very easy to prepare, and had all the ingredients on hand.  Made at last minute to pop into oven with the chicken that was roasting.  I halved the recipe for family of four...used one bag of refrigerated hash browns and one can of soup. Came out yummy.

I have made this recipe numerous times over the holidays and it always gets devoured!  Everyone raves over it and in  my opinion, this tases as good or getter than Cracker Barrell hashbrown casserole.  You can't go wrong making this for dinner, breakfast , or any family gathering.  We also liked to have leftovers (Ham and this casserole) with scrambled eggs during the holdiays for breakfast!

Very good.  I used 1 can of chicken soup rather than two, used refrigerated shredded potatoes (2#), added a little garlic salt, sauteed the onions before adding to the casserole and eyeballed the cheese...used a lot more than stated.    It took a lot longer to bake than the time stated but it seems to be a forgiving casserole as I baked it for the time stated and then kept it in the oven (at 350) with the ham, turkey breast, and baked ziti that I was reheating for a get together.  All told, it was probably in the oven for a total of two hours (covered) but it didn't burn or dry out.  Thanks for a good recipe Louise!

I have made this twice.  Followed recipe exactly the first time and it came out too runny/mushy with soggy hashbrowns.  The second time I made it with only one can of soup, real onion, extra cheese, made sure the hashbrowns were completely thawed before cooking and cooked it for an hour and it was very good.  Thank you for the recipe.

Really good, but I made a few changes...I used about double the butter and double the cheese, and I added lots of crumbled bacon to give it some meat.  I also mixed about two cups of cornflakes with 4 tbsp melted butter for the topping (in addition to the cheese) instead of just using the cornflakes alone.  Delicious!  And works as a stand-alone breakfast when you add the meat to it!

I had this for the first time in Missouri, I guess there is a restaurant that has this as a signature dish and people have copied the recipe. This wasn't as good as the dish I had there but it was close enough. I will be getting the original recipe as opposed to making this one again though.

This was awesome!  I had last minute added guests and had a lot of other things to do.  This was easy and was eaten the fastest!  I added almost 3 1/2 lbs to the original recipe and still was the fastest to go.  This will be added to my annual pre-Thanksgiving evening brunch!

Love this!  Only a few changes: Instead of plain sour cream, I whisked the sour cream together with 4 oz. french onion  dip and omitted the onion flakes. I also added 2 tablespoons of melted margarine to the cornflakes.  Had to increase cooking time to 1 hr, 10 min.  (Before adding toppings, be sure to taste mixture and add salt & pepper as needed.  It's better to season it before cooking rather than afterwards.  If you wait, it'll taste bland.)  Don't count on leftovers!

This is a nice easy meal.  My husband just loved it.  I didn't have any onion flakes so I added some onion chopped up really fine.  I also added some chopped up ham and I think I liked it even better with the ham in it.  I will be making this again for my family.

This was great! I did take the advice of other revies and used twice the amount of cheese, use minced onions instead of onion flakes and topped it with Cheezits. I served this at a large family breatkfast and everyone enjoyed it!

I really like this recipe. I do a few things to make it a little lighter. I buy low-fat sour cream, and Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Chicken. I also don't use the butter...I don't think the dish needs it. I spray Pam on the top of the Corn Flakes to help them get golden and enhance the flavor. I also chop up an onion, saute it, and then add it into the mixture. I also use more cheese - 8 oz. With those few tweaks it tastes great. Everyone always comments on what a good dish it is.

Terrific recipe! Like others before I increased the amount of cheese, but also added Montreal Chicken seasoning. It adds a great kick to the hashbrowns.

This has become the favorite at any event I host.  I add extra cheese and extra corn flakes.  Of course I have to bake it longer but it's worth the wait!

Excellent for any occasion. Very easy to prepare. I use my Nesco cooker which makes it very portable to take to picnics. I do however use Colby cheese instead of the sharp Cheddar. It seems to give the dish a milder flavor.

This recipe was great! Like others, i used a lot more cheese the 1st time i made it. The next time i substituted one can of cream of chicken with cheddar cheese soup. It gave it a bit more flavor! Very easy to make!!

This is a recipe I had and lost but happily have found again ! I leave the corn flakes off the top and put a thin layer of shredded cheese on top instead. We like things cheesy at our house. Thank you for sharing this yummy dish. It goes really well with Ham and Pork dishes.

This recipe is okay.  It works, but I don't think it's tasty enough to justify all the fat from sourcream, cheese, and cream of chicken soup.

I still don't know what I did wrong, but baking @ 350 for 45 minutes didn't cut it.  I finally had to take it out after it had been baking for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It was holding up dinner!  Anyway, they were pretty good, but still not crispy enough for my taste.  The cooking time was very misleading.  Overall, not bad.  Oh yeah, and I subbed cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken soup.  I like the flavor much better.

This recipe was very good!  I used cream of mushroom soup, as others had advised.  I forgot to add the onion.  And I also tried to cook in my Pampered Chef deep-dish baker.  It turned out a little too creamy for my taste.  I think next time I make it I will put it in a larger pan so some of the soup cooks out.  I made it while my parents were visiting and it was the ONLY thing that I made that they ate ALL of!!  It didn't last long. My husband and two year old also loved it! We will surely make this again!

This was very good and very easy to make. I did use less sour cream and cheese than called for and it was still really rich.  I also cooked this an additional 15 min., uncovered to allow it to brown a bit.  Next time I will try adding chopped ham.

I think this casserole recipe is a great starting point.  I personally think it needs more cheese than 4 oz,  I used 8 and loved it.  Also, try using o'brian hashbrowns (w/ the peppers and onions)  that's really good too!

I doubled the cheese and left out the cornflakes.  Because I used a 2-quart baking dish (filled to the very top) and used a bit more sour cream than the recipe called for, I had to bake for almost 90 minutes.  It was delicious and easy to put together.  Will definitely make again.

The changes I did was used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. 1 pound of breakfast sausage and parmesan bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. Family of 5 loved it and we will definitely have again.

We loved it!  Very easy to make.  I made a few changes.  I already had cornflake crumbs that were intended for something else, so used those-- had a cup.  Used 4 Tbles of butter, melted, that I mixed into the crumbs. Next time will use 1 1/2 C of crumbs & use more butter. I also added 3/4 # of lean grnd beef, browned.  Only had 8 oz pkg of co-jack cheese, since not sharp used whole pkg.  Filling & very good!

Family and friends really enjoy this dish.  I've made some changes by using 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, fresh chopped onion and also added bacon to the mix.  I leave out the cornflakes.

This casserole turned out great.  As I was preparing it I realized I did have any cheddar in my fridge, so I used Gouda and it was amazing.

I made this for my family yesterday and it was a hit!! Instead of  2 cans of Cream of Chicken, I substituted one for a can of Cream of Celery. I only used 1 cup of sour cream and I melted 1/2 cup of butter to add to the hashbrown mixture. I also added chopped onions and as much cheese as I desired. Instead of corn flakes, I mixed melted butter and crushed ritz crackers for my topping, then baked until bubbling...DELICIOUS!!! Even though I tweaked the recipe a little, I will most definitely make this again.

Delicious! The only change I made was using real onions and doubled the cheese.  I cut recipe in half and next time will bake for a full hour and do not put toppings on until last 15-20 minutes. If I make a full batch I will use 1 can of cream of chicken & 1 cream of celery or mushroom so chicken flavor is not so strong,

I gave it a four, because to me it just was too bland. My boys, who usually scarf up food, only ate one portion.  So it was good for only one meal.

My roommates and I used to make this dish in college, now my son wanted to give it a go. I added a picture. You will see white cheddar Cheesits and generic wheat thins crushed on top instead of cornflakes, because I walked right by the cornflakes in the store, today, lol. I am sure it. Will be. Delicious.

This is an excellent recipe! I add equal parts cream of chicken soup and sour cream. 12 oz sharp cheddar cheese grated cause we love it cheesy and top it with French onion straws instead of adding chopped onion. This has been a family favorite for many years!

I've made this dish for years, with only minor changes. First, instead of cream of chicken I use cream of potato or cream of broccoli. I use fresh onion instead of the dried, and for the best topping-instead of crushed cereal, I use crushed potato chips mixed with crushed fried onions. 

You can also make this in a crockpot easily, mix all ingredients except for topping, and cook on low for 3-4 hours (potatoes will come out softer this way) stirring every hour, and then every 20 minutes for the last hour. I like to do this on hectic holidays when I can't fit another pan in the oven. Enjoy!

Very yummy and easy to make! Goes great with almost any meal. A great dish for a family get-together or carry-in. I diced a small onion instead of the onion flakes. This dish is always a hit at my house!

I love hashbrown Casserole. I use cream of celery soup instead and it tasts way better. More cheese for sure and real onion. Instead of cornflakes for the top try regular chips. It will turn out amazing!

Casserole was good.  Needs something a bit more, it was a little bland.  I used onion flakes so maybe real onions?? I also added some Bacon seasoning from Tastefully Simple, I didn't care much for the sharp cheese, next time I may use a mixture.  Will try again, going to use my leftovers and mix it with my leftover ham from Christmas.

I have been making it for years and my whole family loves it, I make a few changes like omitting the sour cream(hubby not a fan of it) 2 pkg shredded hashbrowns, 2 can cream of chicken, one stick butter diced, onion flakes, about a half cup milk and 16oz shredded cheese..I could it in crock pot and serves as a side with ham balls for easter or its a quick meal for supper by adding ham and putting in the oven on 375 for about 45 min, stirring every 15 min.

This was so, so delicious! Like others, I added more cheese (I'd say 1 cup in the mix, 1/2 a cup on top), plus added garlic and 5 strips of bacon. I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cheddar cheese soup. It was absolutely fabulous!

Just served this at my daughters Open House for high school graduation. Had so many people tell me how good it was. My daughter is a vegetarian so I used Cream of Potato soup instead of Cream/Chicken. And I modified it to serve 30 people. It was so easy to make and it fit perfectly in large buffet size roasting foil pan. Perfect!

Been making this for years and everyone loves it.  My version uses the cubed frozen hash browns with peppers and onions(potatoes O'brien) Then you can omit the onion flakes. I also use cream of mushroom soup and a bit more butter and cheese.  But this is a GREAT cook-out side dish. We make it at the lake ahead of time and pop it in the oven while  getting the rest of dinner ready. Winner everytime!

I cut back on the sour cream and soup because I added extra cheese and I didn't want it to get too soupy.  I would just do the recipe as is with the extra cheese because it ended up a little dry (which was my own fault).  Yum!

A nice easy side dish. I had to alter this recipe based on ingredients on hand and personal taste.  I used 1 can cr. chicken and 1 can broccoli and cheese, a full 2 cups of cheese, and only 1/2 t. of onion powder for kids sake.  On top I used 3 T. of melted butter mixed w/ 1/2 sleeve of crushed ritz crackers.  Will make again.

Made as a dinner casserole by adding thinly sliced kielbasa, 3 cloves pressed garlic, and WAY more cheese. 1 small block xtra sharp cheddar, and 1 small block pepper jack. Put 3/4 of it in and other 1/4 on top. Used sliced green onions and some onion salt, instead of dried flakes. Used fresh grated potatoes, and as I didnt have cornflakes, used panko bread crumbs. Very tasty this way.

This is a great recipe for some cheesy, creamy casserole!  I followed other's advice and substituted one can of cream of mushroom soup for one of the cans of cream of chicken.  I also added a little extra sour cream to get my desired consistancy and used a real onion.  Thanks also for giving me the tip to coat the cornflakes with butter...it turned out great!

I tried using fresh grated potatoes instead of frozen potatoes and it turned out mushy, but tasty.  I'm sure it's good with the frozen potatoes.

Really enjoyed this casserole.    Made ahead for Christmas dinner the day before.    Didn't feel like chopping fresh onions so used diced green onions I already had chopped and on hand.  They added a nice color and the flavor was great.  Kids spotted the onions too easily so next time I will use regular onions.  Didn't have corn flakes on hand so I used corn flake bread crumbs and it turned on fine.  Thanks for sharing.

I baked the hashbrowns in the oven first, (until they were brown) before assembling the casserole.  It made the final product much better.  One can of mushroom soup and more cheese, as well as real onion and onion salt..perfect!

My mom has been making this for us since I was a kid, only she sauteed a real onion in butter and then melted the soup, sour cream and (a lot of) cheese together in the same pan and then combined that with the hashbrowns. She would also crush up the cornflakes with some melted butter and then sprinkle that on top - more fattening *haha* but absolutely delicious. I've never met anyone who didn't like this recipe, it's definitely one of my favorites.

I loved this casserole the first time I had it in a work related event.  Since then (last 3 years) it's become a must for Thanksgiving Dinner.  I did tweek it a bit also. I only use 1 can of cream soup and I also dice 1/2 a medium onion, sautee it and add to the mix.  I've also prepared this the night before with diced ham or crumbled sausage and baked it the next morning for beakfast....Yummm!  The downside is I don''t make often because it has so many delicious calories :(

It's kind of funny when I have my baked potatoes I drown it in sour cream and I love it. Ironically, this is what the casserole reminds me of and I didn't like at all. Thanks for the recipe though, its always nice to try new things.

I doubled the recipe! I used mushroom soup instead of chicken. I browned 2 lbs. of sausage with diced onion, other than that, I followed the recipe. When it first comes out of the oven, it's pretty much SOUP! But after a night in the fridge, it was REALLY good!!!

I make a similar casserole for family functions...I make the following changes: -add 1 can cream o' mushroom -use white onions (sauteed is best) -for a big kick, add diced chiles or chopped jalapenos (no extra juice!)

Everyone will rave over this. Great for a party, just double the recipe. The only changes I made was added more cheese and everyone seems to like it better when I use Frosted Flakes over regular corn flakes. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

We've been making this recipe in our family for quite a few years - it's always a big hit!  I use fresh onion that I process in my mini chopper because we don't like crunching into chunks of onion though.  I don't really measure the amount of cheese I use either, just dump til it looks right.  The cheesier the better! ; )

I love this casserole! I make this for all the major holidays and birthdays in the fall and winter months. The only change I make is adding much more cheese. This last time, I used almost 1 lb of cheese within and on top of the casserole. Yummy!!!!

This casserole recipe is pretty delicious. I used 1 can of condensed cream of chicken, plus 1 can of condensed cheese soup. I felt that 2 cans was too much and the recipe was too creamy. I wasn't a fan of the result of this recipe, but EVERYONE loved this casserole at my work. I call them my testers... it was gone in about 2 hours.

I made this on Christmas morning & it was wonderful!!  The only shredded potatoes I could find already had onions & peppers in them so it had a very good flavor, I didn't need to use minced onion flakes.  I will use it again for sure!  Thank you!

This is a good one, I have made it before. The recipe is written well, and is generally the same as many i have seen. I usually add more cheese and cornflakes. I am going to try the idea of using the ranch dressing.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. It's simple and classic. It doesn't need all those alterations. My late grandmother used to make this exact recipe at every family holiday and they were called "Party Potatoes." I've continued the tradition at my own family functions.

Great recipe!  I made it for a breakfast meeting and it was a hit!  I did alter the receipe a bit:  I added sausage (precooked), 1/2 cup red bell pepper (finely chopped) and used 1/2 cup real onion (also finely chopped).  I also forgot the butter (on accident) and it wasn't missed! One last thing... I was only able to use ONE 1-Lb bag of hashbrowns - two bags would not have fit in the 9x13 even w/o sausage.

We frequently make this casserole in our house.  It is also a sure thing at any holiday meals.  We love it.  My husband loves meat so we put some chopped pre-cooked ham on one side of the casserole dish just for him.

I've made similiar recipes before that only took one can of cream of chicken soup and I think I liked that better.  I think two cans made it a little too salty for me.

My husband and I loved this.  I halved the recipe.  Also, I added more cheese and a little browned sausage. Sprinkled the sausage on top with the cornflakes and some of the cheese. This is a Keeper!  Look forward to making this again! I made this for dinner, but the left overs were great the next morning for breakfast!

This was pretty good but seemed to be missing something. I left the butter out but I don't think that is what it was....maybe real onion would have helped. Regardless, it disappeared in muinutes at my party and I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe today for Easter dinner.  It was very easy to make, however, I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a bit bland.  I added some Monterey Jack cheese as well as sharp chedder.  My guests liked it though. I will certainly make this again but I will doctor it up a bit more.

So good! I halved this recipe.  I used minced onion instead of flaked. And I used way more cheese then called for. Instead of putting the butter in the casserole, I melted it and poured it over the corn flake topping. Really tasty and filling.

Fabulous dish, perfect to feed overnight guests in the morning. Next time we're going to add pre-cooked bacon or cubed ham. I think it would also be delicous with chopped tomato and green onion, although my husband asked that I leave that out of his half. We gorged ourselves on this until we were sick from overeating.

This is excellent. The only changes I made was to use 8 oz. of shredded cheese and crushed potato chips on top. I personally missed not having diced onions, however, my teen that hates them did well with the onion flakes. Thanks for the post :) PS. This went great with slow cooker ham.

Yummy! A good, old faithful potluck dish..always a hit. However, I sub cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken and cubed hashbrowns for shredded. I also add a little cajun seasoning & garlic powder to make a fantastic recipe even better.

I make this...except...If you want a bolder flavor..use cream of chicken and herb soup.  I also use real chopped onion and way more butter..like a cup! Hey..just have to serve it..I only eat a bit of it!! Plus...I do not put any cornflakes on it...but the basics are good!

love this recipe.  i use fresh diced onion, sauteed 'til translucent and also add diced bell pepper (red or green or both, depending on what i have on hand) and diced ham or crumbled cooked bacon. It has become a standard winter brunch recipe.

Very good.  Followed the recipe exact except I used 8oz of cheese and it came out great.  I would recommend that you make this dish in the 9x13 as stated.

This recipe is very good and a family favorite.  I omit 1 can of cream of chicken and replace it with nothing.  Instead of crushed corn flakes I crush up potato chips and use those.  I wouldn't thaw the potatoes either.  Just use them frozen and cook that way otherwise it may be too mushy.

Men love this!  It very easy to make and has a good flavor.  I added fresh ground pepper and a little cayenne pepper.  It is not very eye appealing because it is blah, but very stomach appealing!
