Enjoyed this, but I can't say that it's my favorite chopped chicken liver spread.  It just seemed to be lacking a little something.  Followed the recipe as written, but I did add a little bit of sherry.  I halved the recipe, and this made a lot more than three servings as an appetizer.  Thanks for sharing, but I doubt that I'll be making this again.  3.30.11 early evening now.  OK, I know there are closet chopped chicken liver fans out there (nobody wants to admit they like this stuff).  I want to go on record as saying that I reviewed this recipe early afternoon before really giving its flavors a chance to develop.  It says to "refrigerate for four hours," and after having some as an appetizer this evening, that is so key to the flavor of this recipe.  I hate to gush about chopped chicken livers (I luv the stuff), but the flavors really meld after several hours in the fridge.  If you like chopped chicken livers, give this a try...it's EASY and oh so good!  But be patient, and don't pass judgment too soon like I did.  And I WILL be making this again.

I Loved it. Added 1 tsp Ginger Garlic paste to the onions for frying. And squeezed a little bit of lemon to the final product. It was delicious. Enjoyed it hot.

Excellent recipe! I added more eggs and touch of mayo. We like to serve this with paper thin sliced onion on top. Thanks for posting!

Love this recipe! I didn't broil the liver--I ended up frying it in butter and oil instead. I then used some of the juices to fry with the onion and then carrots. I really like the cooked AND raw onions in this recipe. I've tried other ones that only use cooked onions. The raw onions bring out more flavor.  The carrots also were a good addition. I thought it tasted delicious before even refrigerating, so I can't wait to try it after it cools down in a few hours! I'll definitely be making this again!
