My husband, who is the least picky eater in the world and who has been very patient with my attempts to try new things, did not enjoy this. We made Hamburger Helper instead.

As a vinegar fan, this struck up my curiousity, and I thought it was going to be good...I was wrong. Will never be making this again.

I went against my better judgement and made this in spite of the bad reviews.  I have to agree with everyone else.  I gave it one star instead of zero because it was edible.  I got it down; I just didn't enjoy it.

There wasn't enough breading and it didn't stick very well.  I kept having to shove it really hard and then move it around a lot, trying to fill in where it missed.  In the end, it just ended up all blotchy and not covered.  It also fell off easily when turning the steak over. So it's not exactly that I couldn't eat it, or even that it had too strong a vinegar taste.  It was just a lot of work for something that didn't turn out great.

I think this is the first time I have ever given just one star and I hated to do it but I have to be honest.  For my family, meat is so expensive we don't get beef often at all so when I splurged on some round steak, which even at one of the toughest cuts is still $7 a pound, I wanted to find a new recipe to try. I could have just cried that I didn't trust the reviews and used this.  I am pretty good at salvaging almost any cooking mistake but the vinegar had just ruined this for us. I think a mix of balsamic vinegar and beef broth may have saved it but too late for me.

not saying that vinegar doesn't tenderize steak,it is not to taste like vinegar after it is cooked.

Even after using our regular spices and gravy to serve this dish, all anybody could taste was the vinegar. My son said it tasted like pickles. Usually my family  loves my round steak, but they did not eat more than 1 bite. Skip the marinade unless you love vinegar!!
