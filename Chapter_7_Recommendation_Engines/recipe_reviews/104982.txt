In my opinon, your ingredient choices will make or break this salad from 5 star plus to a 2 or 3 star. I have had this about 6 or 7 times (various recipes). By FAR the best is using stale hard rolls or very-chewy Italian bread. If you don't, the bread just becomes mushy instead of that wonderful, chewy, garlic-bread bites that is so special in this recipe. Alot of the flavor is from your choice garlic and oil, too. I use a high quality EVOO and FRESH only: minced garlic, mozzarella and basil leaves. If you don't use the fresh, it alters the flavor significantly. I think cherry or grape tomato's texture is better suited for this.  Capers are a nice added flavor and, as I discovered tonight, so is roasted asparagas. With all that being said...made with our preferences, this goes in the favorite file.

Fabulous salad!!! This is bruschetta in a bowl. I used more tomatoes, kalamata olives, and a lot more fresh basil. Due to the small amount of dressing the bread does not get soggy. The leftovers the next day were still good. Tons of great flavor in this dish!

OMG this is super good! I used white balsamic vinegar, no onions, because they are too overpowering, and no olives, personal choice. The flavors mix wonderfully and it's the perfect summer salad. It was so hot here today that I toasted the bread on the bbq in a pan of course, using the indirect method, they came out perfect and had that smokey flavor. I used smart balance instead of olive oil on the bread too. I will make this again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a FANTASTIC salad.  I used it as a foundation and added some chopped fresh spinach leaves to it.  The flavors are wonderful.  I used the broiler to toast the bread.  Then I made a layer of bread, then put the salad on top of it to serve to my family.  Even my 7 year old grandson loved it!  Way to go!!

WOW!  This is a fantastic dish!!!  My family of picky eaters loved it.
I didnt have any fresh basil on hand so I substituted dried italian seasoning.  I also used black and green  olives and added pepperoni because I had some that I needed to use up and it really made the salad delicious.
My husband has already asked when we can have this again.

Excellent summer salad. I used Kalamata olives in place of the green (b/c that's what I had.) Everyone raved about this dish! Can't wait to try w/ capers! Thanks for the recipe!

This is great. I used french bread for the croutons and sea salt instead of ordinary salt in the seasoning. I didn't have olives so had to leave them out but will make again soon with them Very enjoyable. Many thanks.

This was such a huge hit, I had to make it 2 days in a row!  We first tried it as the second course of a gourmet meal, and this recipe was really really close to that gourmet panzanella!  Excellent!

Wow this was great.  I made it for a BBQ and it was the first thing to go.  Everyone kept picking at it even when we were done eating.  I used a long french stick bread that wasn't a day old, but worked fine.  Toasted it in the oven for 13 minutes.  I made it early in the day and didn't want it to get too soggy so I put all the other ingredients in a bowl, without the balsamic mix, and put the cooled bread on top.  About 45 minutes before serving that's when I added the balsamic, tossed it, and let it sit.  It came out perfect.  This is definitely a staple for BBQs now.  Thanks!

Amazing!  Have never had nor made a panzanella salad. As I toasted up some leftover French bread, I went out into the garden and picked grape tomatoes, and some basil.  Also used a red onion from the garden.  Used capers instead of olives. It was just the right amount of balsamic vinegar w/ the olive oil. We both loved it.  With the amount of tomatoes we have right now.... I could make this for 3 meals a day for a month!!  In January I will have a memory of all the freshness in this salad.

I made this last night and was disappointed that it seemed dry. However, I will try again, when I have more people to feed besides myself. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings. Others have said when you do that, sometimes the proportions are not correct. Also, I think the marrinated mozzarella balls might improve the taste.
I REALLY wanted to like this!

This salad is wonderful!  I have brought it to many parties and it is the first to go!  I use the marinated mozzarella balls from Costco and kalamata olives instead of green.  It really is a great dish.  Thanks!!!

I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews. I would have used very hard/chewy bread rather than just day old Italian, as my bread got soggy. I would have also used more tomatoes, onions and olives. As is, it was OK, but has the potential to be better.

Even though we changed a few ingredients, we loved it!  I used 1 T Italian seasoning instead of the basil, black instead of green olives, and snow peas for the green color.  We loved the flavor combinations!  We'll make it again!

A wonderful recipe!! I added some fresh chopped parsley, a combination of fresh purple and sweet basil, used 25 year old balsamic (if you have never had 25-yr balsamic: it's CREAMY smooth and outstanding) and a squeeze of fresh lemon. It was excellent!!!

This was really good...I couldn't find any Italian bread, so I used rosemary bread. I figured since we eat that a lot at a fav Italian restaurant, it would make a good substitute...it was! The whole salad was quick and easy and went very well with our pesto burgers. Even my son, who wouldn't touch tomatoes growing up, enjoyed it. Thanks! We've made this a couple of times now and I've started leaving out the onion and it's even better!

Wow!  We loved this and will make it once or twice a week as long as the tomatoes hold out.  It is very important to use very chewy bread and best quality ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the cheese, which I skipped, but I'm sure it would also be great with cheese.  Thanks for this recipe.  note:  I have also added chicken to make it a main dish summer supper.

I knew there was a reason i had been saving that half loaf italian bread in the freezer! i thawed it in the microwave, it  worked perfectly.i was not exact about  proportions, instead i used up the  tomatoes, mozzarella, bread onion and olives i had on hand, and cut the basil inmy garden to toss in (hopefully the tomatoes will be growing there soon!)  i substituted garlic salt for clove garlics. Only thing i added  to the recipe was a little bit of pure vanilla which i have recently discovers goes soooooo smoothky with baksamic and oilve oil. My family loved this and ate every bite,  perfect summer salad, thanks!

AMAZING!  Veggiemom, I loved this.  THANK YOU!  We made the recipe as stated with crusty focaccia bread, grape tomatoes and kalamata olives.  It was amazing and great the next day too (though softer).  I will make this many more times.  Who cares if it's not a "healthy salad?"  I love it.  Thanks!

Is this ever delicious!! I made it for a potluck and it got rave reviews. I prepared the bread in advance, then set aside. I mixed the bread in with the rest the ingreients just before walking out the door. The bread stayed nice and chewy - not too soggy. I used Kalamata olives instead of green ones. Will be making this again very soon!

I followed the recipe, omitted olives because the man at home doens't care for them. I thought it was kind of bland...so I added some crumbled bacon and a splash of rice wine vinegar. My changes improved it, but I do not think I will make this again.

This recipe is terrific. My wife, who is a very fussy eater just loved it. I did add a little more cheese than called for but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I my wife's words "This is a company salad".

I can't eat enough of this salad!  The roasted garlic flavor combined with the tomatoes and mozzarella is wonderful.  Try to use fresh garden tomatoes for the best outcome.

My husband and I really enjoyed this salad.  I was gifted a loaf of homemade Italian bread.  I didn't want any of it to go to waste so went looking for a recipe to use it up.   I agree with another reviewer who said it is important to use the best quality ingredients.  It makes all the difference.  We will definitely be making this again!

Yummmm!  Anytime I can eat a "salad" made out of bread, I'm in!  This was just divine and pretty much a big bowl full of all my favorite ingredients.   I just realized that I forgot the onions, but it was still delicious.  I used a mix of green onions and kalamata and that was delicious.

Wow! This is probably the best salad that I have ever made. I took it to a family bbq and we polished it off in one sitting. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out beautifully. This recipe is one that I will definitely make over and over again...like tomorrow!

I made this for a neighborhood picnic last night, and it was delicious!  I followed the directions on everything except I left out the green olives (I forgot to buy them).  I used a very high quality 18 year balsamic and I think it made the salad.  This is a keeper!

Oh my gosh this stuff is good!!! I can't put my fork down!  I am gladly taking this for lunch the rest of the week! I only made a couple changes- omitted the onion, used about 3/4 cup grated mozarella, and used black olives instead because I had them on hand.  This was a great use for the basil from my garden.  I will continue to make this often.

I made this salad for a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it.  What a nice flavor this salad had.  The changes I made per other reviews were:  I used ciabatti rolls, used cherry tomatoes cut in half, used black olives instead of green, and used garlic infused canola oil from Pampered Chef for the bread pieces.  No leftovers.  Will be making again.

I made this salad exactly as written. While good, it was not my fave. (sorry pixie!) I am a big bread lover, but even I was a bit turned off when the bread got a little mushy. If I were to serve this to guest, I would wait until the last minute to stir in the bread.

Enjoyable! It's bruchetta as a salad! I used bread salad croutons instead of the cubing bread so that saved me a step. I also recommend using 1/2 of the bread in this recipe.  You do not need all that bread and it does not keep well but very good using within an hour.  It really can be a meal in itself.

This is fantastic.  I didn't add olives or cheese, and used more fresh basil.  My daughter loved the garlicky croutons on their own (I did add a bit of dried basil to those before baking).

What a wonderful way to showcase fresh veggies from your summer garden.  We had salad night for dinner, and this was my favorite of the 3 that I made.  I did omit the olives, due to our personal tastes. I was worried about the bread getting all soggy, but at the 30 minute mark, it was perfect.  Thanks veggiemom, for sharing this delicious salad recipe!

Love this, I used an entire loaf of italian bread and also used 10 cloves of garlic. Also used 16 oz of fresh mozz, half a red onion diced because the onion will over power the entire dish, didn't use the olives at all, it was perfect!

10 Stars!!!! We all loved this salad.  I will probably be making it again, as soon as I can get to the store to buy more ingredients to make it.  Even my kids couldn't get enough of it.  This will be made probably once a week at my house now.

This was good, but I'd rather just have a caprese salad with toasted bread on the side. The leftovers we really didn't eat cuz the bread was soggy.

This was delicious. I used a seeded artisan bread and other than leaving out the green olives and cheese, pretty much followed the recipe. I did add roasted red pepper instead of the olives. Will definitely make again.

This salad is to die for!!!!! I didn't have the six day old bread so I used focaccia bread.  It worked so well because that type of bread does not get soggy.  It was fantastic and I highly recommend this salad...

FANTASTIC!!!  An awesome way to use up bread that is old but still good.  The only change I made was to add artichoke hearts, will definitely do that again and probably a nice ripe avocado as well mext time.  Cubed a full STALE baguette from Panera and used the oiled & toasted cubes in AR's Rich and Simple French Onion Soup as well-  AMAZING pairing, HIGHLY recommend it!!!  REALLY makes a difference to use good quality bread, balsamic, and evoo here... well, use good quality EVERYTHING if you can obviously, but if not at a minimum good bread... and balsamic... let them eat cake =)

This recipe was just OK.  It was mostly starch and very little that represented healthy food values.

This was surprisingly excellent.  I was trying to think of something different to make for a get-together with three old friends. My sister was in Italy recently and mentioned how much she enjoyed the Panzanella salad and said that I should try finding a recipe.  I looked on many websites, some recipes were more simple, some more complex.  This one fell about in the middle so I went with it.  My three friends raved about it and ate 98% of it!!! They couldn't get enough.  The only thing I did differently was that I used Kalamata olives which I prefer, otherwise I followed it to a 'T'. I also came close to over-toasting the bread, but it was GREAT and I liked the crouton type texture of the bread.  Scrumptious and filling!

I've made this a handful of times now and it always hits the spot, we omit the olives based on personal preference, but everything else goes really well together.  A great summer dinner!

I have been eating this salad for three days! It's amazing. At first, I didn't think it would have enough flavor without more seasoning. I made it exactly according to the recipe. It was fantastic! I will make this again and again.

Loved the fresh veggies and bright flavors. This was great on day one but scale the recipe because soggy bread isn't great for leftovers.

I made this for a Labor Day cook out and it was a hit.  I used cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and black and kalamata olives.  It was very tasty.  There were no left overs!  I will definately make this again.

I love Panzanella salad but this became absolutely ruined by using Balsamic vinegar. I am aggravated with myself for not seeing that. Wayyyyyyyyyyyy too sweet. Plus with the tomatoes, it becomes sweeter. Think [unlike I did, & use wine or cider vinegar instead]!

I made this salad along with an Italian feast I was having for family and friends.  I really didn't expect it to be the absolute hit that it was! I took the advice of other reviews and purchased day old ciabata and super fresh ingredients.  I used grape tomatoes that I sliced in half.  I was going to leave out the olives as I do not like the black or green variety but, I'm so glad I didn't.  They are an absolute must. I chopped them up instead of halving them as the recipe suggests.  The way the basil, onion, olive, garlic and vinegrette come together make this salad really special with minimal effort.  This definately goes in the "keeper" file.

Oh this is tasty!! The 6 cups of bread cubes used in the recipe required just over 3/4 lb. loaf ciabatta bread.  Speaking of bread, definitely use a crusty, hearty bread for best results.  I got mine on the clearance rack at the supermarket (almost expired).  Also, I would not bother making this recipe unless I had extremely fresh, tasty tomatoes.  It's all about a few fresh ingredients with this recipe.  My guests were raving over this!

I just LOVED this!! It was very good and something different for my taste buds.  It is a visually stunning recipe, and totally Delish!  I only made one little change( Cring!!), I used smoked Gouda instead of the mozzarella.The fact that I could get a day old loaf of perfectly great bread and turn it into something completely different was worth trying this recipe! Thank you very much.:) Patty

This recipe is very good. It is especially good because you crisp the bread in the oven first. I used a very dense, crusty rosemary bread. They were not soggy. I did everything just the way the recipe said and it was very delicious.

Holy ! This is beyond fantastic! I did add some paprika and oregano to the croutons and extra garlic. They came out awesome, I cut them on the big side which kept them from becoming mushy from the dressing. I actually cut up all the veggies (adding some leftover cucumuber) and the cheese and basil, made the dressing and then marinated it all together for about 2 hours and then mixed in the bread. I also added about a tbsp of capers instead of the olives. My husband just grabbed the bowl and out right out of it and as I was putting away what little leftovers there are I had to have some more. Will definitely make again!! Served this with Balsamic Chicken and Fresh mozzarella and it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time!

This was the best thing I have had on my plate in a long time - and that is saying something!  I see many people have changed the recipe, but I made it as is and I don;t think I'll be changing  it!  In-season tomatoes make it.  I love tomatoes fresh by themselves and don't think they need anything but salt, but this compliments their freshness!  If you are growing tomatoes and basil, this is the recipe for you!

I had no idea what to expect when I made this, but it was really good.  Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and balsamic vinegar are always good together, but this combination is very flavorful, and has an interesting texture.  The bread makes it very filling, so it can be a meal in itself, or as a side dish.  I often serve it with grilled chicken.  Yum!

Am I the only one that wasn't crazy about this dish? It was good when the bread was crunchy but as it got mushy... it just wasn't for me. I also followed the recipe exactly.

Out of control good!!  I did use green and black olives, also added some capers for tang. Fresh basil is key!! I think the only thing I really did different was to not use the 1/3c of olive oil for the bread cubes. I just sprayed my cubes with evoo Pam spray and sprikled them with garlic powder and fresh cracked pepper. I did make the salad in advance and added the bread cubes before serving....so delicious!

I loved this! I didnt think it would be as good as it was, but it was great! I used some leftover "French bread rolls to die for" from this site which was perfect. I didnt have any fresh basil, so I used a little dried, didnt have any olives, and only had shredded mozzarella. Very tasty! Definitely will be making this again!

I've made this twice in the past week and IT IS PHENOMENAL! For the latest batch, I cut up ciabatta bread yesterday afternoon and let it sit on the counter till lunchtime today. It got good and stale. Definitely go with more garlic. I toasted the bread for 10 minutes. When it was time to eat, I put some fresh, crisp spinach in my salad bowl and topped it with the panzanella & a turn or two of cracked pepper....mmmmmm....Thank you, thank you to Pixie2 for "pushing" this recipe!

My son says 3 1/2 but I say 4.. hehe.. I put the garlic, oil, salt and pepper in a bowl and let set while I cut everything up.  I then coated the bread and baked.. WOW .. This in itself made some great croutons.. I mixed the oil,basil leaves and balsmic in a bowl and let set.  It says to put everything together and let set 20min.  I put the dressing and veggies together and let set, then the last 10 min I added the bread as I wanted a little more cruch to mine.  This was very good.  Thank you.

Saw a photo of this salad and wanted to love it but barely liked it.  I scaled back to 4 servings and didn't use the olives but chopped grilled chicken breast in it's place.  Even with the fresh basil I thought this would have a lot more flavor than it did.  I used the french loaf recipe from this site for the bread that was a day old.  I may try this again.

It was easy to make, I will agree that garlic buttered croutons will be just fine; no need to make croutons unless you have some stale bread that needs to be used. I might try it with saltier cheese next time; the mozzarella was a bit bland for my taste. Easy to do and I did use six tomatoes, gave more bulk and depth to the salad.

This was FABULOUS!  My husband raved about this and we couldn't stop eating it.  The fresh basil and mozzarella are a must! I used Greek kalamata olives instead of the green olives and the fresh mozzarella balls that come marinated in oil and seasonings.  I love Italian cooking and this has become one of my favorite side dishes and we have it often.  It is so easy and so delicious.  I've even used toasted garlic sourdough bread that I cut into bite sized pieces when I didn't have any Italian bread on hand.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

My husband says this is a KEEPER!  This is very good and simple.  Would be great with garlic chicken breasts and a green salad. Simple to make, although I did find I needed a bit more oil and vinegar than the recipe called for.  Other than that, perfect.  The flavors are tangy and summery-- really good!!  Thanks.

This was an excellent change to the old standby lettuce salad.  I omitted the olives (not a big fan) and added another splash of balsalmic vinegar.  I'm going to make this for my next potluck!

I used Roma tomatoes and omitted the olives (I just don't like them) and this was DELICIOUS!  Such a nice change from the normal green salad.

I didnt let the bread soak in it because I dont like mushy bread, but I made the croutons and then put them on the bottom of the dish with the salad on top.  It was great.

Yum! This is a delicious salad! My only mistake was letting it marinate a little too long, and some of the bread lost some of its crunch - keep to the 20 minutes. Great fresh dish!

This is so good I made three batches in one week.   Everyone kept asking for more!  I made it with the Italian bread, but also with old sandwich bread (the Italian was better, but the sandwich was not bad at all!)..  I didn't add any cheese or olives and I don't think that it needed either.

This is delicious! First time i made it I did it just like the recipe. 2nd time, Iused half green and half kalamata olives just because I like kalamata. I also used wheat buns instead of bread cubes so it was crustier. Both great, just different

I had never heard of this before, then suddenly this summer, everyone was talking about bread salad. Delicious! I despise green olives, so I substituted black olives, but everything else was exact.

This recipe is very good but I could see how it would vary based on the quality of your ingredients.  I used a dense and crusty semolina sesame loaf that they carry at the specialty bread aisle and this worked perfectly.  I used grape tomatoes in place of regular sliced tomatoes but here I think the sliced would work better to make the bread a little moister.  Although I LOVE garlic, the 3 cloves made it very strong and next time I will cut back to 2.  The onions and olives were omitted so that my kids would eat this (they loved) but I'm sure they would just improve upon this dish.  Definitly a great picnic option and will make again.

I can't believe I found a recipe for this and it turned out as good as it did.  Tasted it years ago at a fantastic restaurant.  Did my Oil and Garlic in blender for a good mix.  Use harder style Itallian bread or it will be too soggy.  Added a tad more vinegar for our palate.  Beautiful!  Thanks for posting

Like others, I changed it up a little bit; I used halved grape tomatoes, kalamata olives and a little less olive oil when toasting the bread.  It is a delicious meatless meal, and this recipe fed 3 of us as a main dish with no leftovers!

My husband RAVED about this salad.  I used a good Italian bread, but it was really dry, and this salad brought it back, and not only made it usable, but absolutely a TREAT.   I did use about 50% more basil than was called for in the recipe. Scrumptious.

I loved this salad. The ingredients you use will definitely make the difference (good crusty bread, fresh tomatoes, and real mozzarella!). I had been looking for a recipe that was new but not so exotic the BF wouldn't want to try it. He loved this! Fit our tasted perfectly.

This salad was wonderful! My husband loved it and so did I. I did make a few changes but nothing major... I added capers per other reviewers suggestions and they were nice. I also omitted the olives because we don't like them and I forgot to add the cheese... opps. It turned out wonderful anyways. We will be making this over and over again!

I loved it!.. The only changes I made were to decrease the red onion down to about 2T...  I loved the chewey/crunchy bread; yum!  UPDATE:  I wanted this so bad but didn't have bread so I used a bag of croutons.  I heated some olive oil in a large pan on med/low, added some garlic then the croutons... Tossed until the garlic was done.  Followed the rest of the recipe except for crumbled feta... :)

I love this recipe, however, I added artichoke hearts cut up and grilled the bread and artichokes and then mixed this all together using cherry tomotoes instead of regular tomatoes and it received RAVE reviews. A definate must keep recipe. Also, you can add some fresh basil to this as well!!! :-)

This was excellent! I had fresh Italian bread so I was worried about it getting soggy, but it held up well  because of the toasting. I used roasted garlic olive oil and I think this helped a lot since I love garlic. I didn't use olives because the bf doesn't like. I also used roma tomatoes. This was so tasty. :)

I am as surprised as you are with my 1* rating.  I thought for sure I would love this recipe as I love everything in the salad and on top of all that, it has great reviews.  I made this as written and took it to a family gathering.  Hardly anyone touched it and heard a few negative comments about it.  Maybe it would have been better for me to make garlic bread and add this topping to it and bake?  I think I will stick to the Tomato Mozzerella Salad from this site.  It is just more appealing in appearance and taste for me.

This is the best!  Yummy every time.  I read the reviews and tried many different variations.  Love to add spinach, capers, olives, grape tomatoes or garden fresh heirloom ones.  I just dump it together keep it rustic and WOW.  All my friends,co workers and neighbors love it. My kids too.

Loved it!! Was out in DC visiting my daughter and she made this salad. Very refreshing taste/Not over filling. It could be a meal in its self.Make sure you use fresh Mozzarella cheese

This was good.  I will definitely make it again.  I added capers and fresh corn that I removed from the cob and I used black olives instead of green.  It tastes really good and looks pretty on the table.

this was very good.  it reminded me of one I had at the resturaunt years ago.  I love it when the bread soaks up all that flavor.  I added a few anchovies on the top, but that's just me.  the recipe was just as good without them.

A new favorite summer salad for me!  Since getting the book Artisan Bread In Five Minutes A Day (fabulous book, highly recommend!) I am baking bread almost every day. So I often have a leftover crusty loaf and this was an outstanding way to use up some day old bread.  I love the idea of trying it with capers instead of olives too as other have suggested.  I can't get enough of ALL of these ingredients so this is a fabulous summer salad!  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this last night and today it's the featured recipe!  I used 1 container of fresh bocconcini from Trader Joe's and subbed a handful of capers for the green olives.  Also added 1/2 an English cucumber, chopped, and let the veggies (minus the basil which I added at the end) marinate in the vinegar and oil while I toasted the bread in the oven.  Then rubbed the bread with the raw garlic - sooo delicious!!  Also, I served this immediately so the bread still had some crunch.

Great!  I didn't have hard bread so I made my own by baking some sandwich bread until it was hard like croutons and then using it in the recipe.  I also roasted the garlic a bit just to make sure it was cooked.  Fresh mozzarella made this soooo good.  I will put in more mozzarella and less olives next time I think.

What a nice twist to the traditional recipe. I loved the idea of toasting the bread with the garlic, oil and seasonings (I used an herb blend). It mellowed the garlic just enough to take the edge off. I left the salt out of the recipe and added brined capers to compensate. I suggest that the mozzarella cubes be added after the salad is plated to preserve their deliciousness. By the way, I used a chewy bread for this recipe - ciabatta was what I had and it really held up. I'm sure focaccia would work such as well. Don't waste your time with supermarket breads for this tasty dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! This is Excellant! I used Klamanti (sp?)olives and a few capers. This could be a meal for me. It got rave reviews at a dinner party tonight. Fresh olive oil, mozzarella and basil are key. Delicious!

This was good, but I would suggest using a little less garlic and onion. It was a little overpowering. Really didn't care for the green olives in this either (and I do like green olives normally!). Do not make too far in advance, the bread will get soggy.

What a great recipe!  Easy to make, and easy to adapt to your own family's tastes.  I added sliced black olives and used halved cherry tomatoes.  Tasted great the next day, even though the bread was soggy!!

AWESOME!  I used a mixture of olives and tossed in some capers.  I had a small amount romaine to use so I tossed it in, as well. I had  been waiting to find fresh basil for this recipe and so glad I did, it really  stands out in this salad.  This recipe is a keeper & I plan to make it often!!  Thanks for sharing.

I'm truly sorry but this salad was just okay. I really, really wanted to like it as it is currently the big hit on the "exchange" but I must be honest. I made exactly as written and ended up with mush. What did I do wrong? Maybe I'll try again and do it this way: Toss vinegrette with everything except the bread. Gently toss bread into salad JUST PRIOR to serving.

OMG, this is the BEST salad!  I added extra tomatoes (no tomato scare here!), I actually used grape tomatoes, red vine tomatoes and yellow heirlooms.  Very reminiscent of bruschetta, which I can eat by the pound.  Wonderful summer salad!

I loved this salad!!  Used capers instead of olives because I just love capers.  Also I used a mix of shredded provolone and mozzarella because that is what I had on hand.  Can't wait to make it with fresh mozzarella!

This was super yummy! The only change I made was to use black olives rather than green.  The flavors are great, and I'm wishing I had made the full recipe rather than halving it.  Next time, I might make a little more of the vinaigrette as I like things more saucy.

Yum.  I used dried rather than fresh basil.  BTW, if your bread is stale enough you don't really need to go through the trouble of baking the pieces.  I used a very hard old french baguette and it made instant croutons when cut.

Great recipe, very tasty. I left out the olives but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I think the only change I will make next time is to use less bread and more tomatoes. The flavor is outstanding.

What better way to use up leftover bread and veggies?  It was quick and delicious.  Even if  the bread and veggies sit in that wonderful dressing, the better it gets!!

Yummy!  I have made this several times, and EVERYONE requests I bring it for a potluck. I have a babyshower tomorrow, and the mommy-to-be and several guests begged me to make this! Totally simple...I don't use olives, but you don't need them - the bread is divine!

This was amazingly delicious. Made this for lunch the day before Thanksgiving to accompany soup- wanted something other than a traditional salad and this was perfect. Everyone loved it and no leftovers. I did use halved cherry tomatoes  instead of chopped tomatoes and used Kalamata olives instead of green olives. I also added some capers and artichoke hearts . I would definitely make again.

This was really fabulous!  A few notes:

It makes way more than you think...seriously, my 4 QUART bowl was overflowing - adjust accordingly.

I used ciabatta bread and it was perfect.  Even after sitting in the fridge for a few days, the bread was no longer crunchy but it wasn't slimy or mushy as bread can get.  Definitely add the garlic while you toast the bread - it gives it a fantastic flavor.

As recommended by others I added half a bag of baby spinach, cut into strips, as well as some artichoke hearts.  

The overall result was wonderful.  I'll be making this again and again!

Because I love Chef John's Panzanella, I had to try this. This was a light, delicious salad that I served with basil-buttered bread. It was so good. I left out the olives, but my husband added them. I only made half a recipe since it was only my husband and me for dinner, but we ate most of it. Refrigerated the rest.

Easy and delicious!  I brought this to my friend’s house as a side dish to her luncheon.  I oven toasted the bread, and prepped all other ingredients in advance.  Thanks to another reviewers note, I put all non bread ingredients in a glass serving bowl, put the oven toasted bread on top, and refrigerated it until I had to leave (about 2-2.5 hours).  Right before leaving I tossed all ingredients, and added the olive oil/balsamic vinegar dressing (tossing again to mix).  The flavors blended during my 40-45 minute drive, which my nose was very happy about ;-).  The salad was a huge hit!  I LOVE allrecipes almost as much as I love the help I get from the other reviewers :-).  P.S.  I followed the recipe to a ‘t’ except for using cherry tomatoes instead of regular sized tomatoes.  The bread I used was the fat ‘chewy’ french style bread baked fresh at Costco.

This salad is an absolute party of flavors in your mouth!  We used kalmata olives only because it’s what I had on hand. Otherwise followed the recipe as written and we both decided it’s a new favorite. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the recipe but added a little more balsamic and a touch more olive oil.  My homemade croutons made from 2 day old bread were wonderful.  They soaked up the vinegar and oil beautifully!

Have been wanting to try this forever! Was not disappointed a bit.  Followed recipe to a tee, no adjustments or addtions, since it was our first try.  I did read some reviews and so bought a baguette of day old crusty French bread.  It does make a difference.  The bread cubes stayed chewy, and not mushy at all.  We did put the tossed salad over some chopped romaine to get more greens in.  We were thinking of all kinds of additions to try (mushrooms, artichoke hearts, ham, salami etc) to give us some variation. I will be making this all summer as my basil is going crazy.

I think it is better to bake the bread pieces at a low temperature for a longer time.  This will harden the bread and keep it from becoming mushy.  Sorry, I use Olive Garden dressing or balsamic on everything.  I would like to add balsamic roasted veggies to this though i.e. onions, bell peppers, small tomatoes and asparagus.  Use Castelvetrano  olives if you don't care for regular olives.  They are mild and have less salt.  You have to pit them though.  Otherwise Kalamata, Greek or oil cured olives are great for Panzanella.

So flippin good!  The only thing i changed is I used kalamata olives instead of the green ones.  I have made this three times already and it is always a hit.  The best way I can describe it is a twist on a caprese salad.  Can't go wrong with that...

This was a big hit in our home! I made a few changes, because I did not have the specific items! I used a Vidallia onion instead of the red! I think I would have liked the red! Next time! I used black pitted olives, which were fine! I added artichoke hearts for lack of capers! I will probably use both next time! Finally, I had the bococini mozzarella balls! Saved me one less thing to do! It’s almost a meal in itself! This is my most favorite salad!

My sig other was skeptical about this recipe and went from not trying it to eating all the leftovers! I use artichoke hearts instead of olives since I don't much care for olives. I also add cucumber. I eagerly await our vine ripened tomatoes so I can make this more often!

I loved this dish! It was so delicious, and my husband loved it, too! I substituted the green olives for capers and added artichokes. After reading other reviews, I made sure to toast the bread until it was quite crispy. I think this really helped keep the bread from getting soggy after adding the dressing. I will definitely make this again!

Traditional, nutritious and delicious!  I add artichoke halves and capers, like my Grandmother used to.  This salad is easy to make and a good way to teach the children that good nutrition can be fun for them to make right along with mom, and sooo good to eat, too!

GREAT fresh tasting (more than a) salad! I made it with what I had on hand so subbed 'old' pumpernickel bread. Definitely on the 'Keeper List'.

I made this the other day, it was enjoyed by all four of us, a rarity.  Easy to make with things on hand,  I'm sick of  making bread crumbs.

So, So good!  I made it just like the recipe states and it was a big hit with my husband and I.  He added pepperoni just to his and I added artichokes just to mine.  If you make it just like the recipe calls for, you can always personalize your individual portions by having different things on the side to add to it.  Great summer salad...

Made changes after trying the original recipe. Used red wine vinegar, which I prefer. I love olive oil, but hate olives (go figure!). I also hate biting into onion, so I used onion powder. With these changes, I think this recipe goes from 3 to 5 stars! Fantastic!

Sometimes simpler is better - I've made panzanella with more complicated dresssings, but the simple olive oil and balsamic used here was just right. I made it with capers instead of olives, and Asiago instead of mozzarella, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was perfect.

I love this salad. Very light and refreshing. Took it to a cookout and came home with no leftovers. I left the croutons out until the day of the event. They would of ended up too soggy.

Delicious!  I have tried multiple versions of bread salad and liked this one best. Toasting the bread makes the difference. 
One minor note; the bits of garlic tend to fall to the cookie sheet and burn during the baking process so I lifted the slightly cooled bread cubes of the baking sheet instead of scraping them straight from the sheet into the bowl that way the burnt garlic pieces were left behind.

I have never had panzanella but always wanted to try it.  I made it pretty much as the recipe says to with the exception that I used good quality croutons I had on hand instead of baking my own.  There seemed to be too much bread in proportion to the other ingredients, so I will cut that down next time.  Otherwise it was very tasty and we liked it a lot.

I make this recipe often.  The croutons are to die for!  I sometimes reduce the amount of tomatoes, omit the basil and add beets.  Then call it a beet salad.  It's very popular at my house. Thanks for sharing!

Omitted the onion, subbed black olives for green, and halved grape tomatoes instead or regular cubed, and used a little more olive oil as needed to fry the bread cubes in a deep skillet to retain crunch after dressing was applied.  More basil also to use up what came in the package. Very good with roasted chicken for Mothers' Day.

I didn't have fresh basil but I did have pesto. I added about 1/4 cup(or more to taste) when I mixed the dressing. It was great! I'll definitely use it again. I also added cooked chicken to make it more of a main dish. There was way too much food for just 2 of us so the next time I make it I'll only make 1/2 a recipe.

This is so good I can't stop eating it. The first time I made it I forgot to buy a red onion, so I used sliced green onions. I just made it for the second time and used the red onion--too strong for me. I'll go back to green onion the next time. And the next and the next and the next. I'd also use a little more fresh mozzarella. This is now one of my favorite salads! So good made with our homegrown tomatoes!

I have made this twice, and it was a hit both times.  I also added cucumbers and omitted the seeds, red and yellow peppers, celery, and shallots. I added both green and Kalamata olives. You need to let the bread soak in the olive oil while you are making the rest of the salad. I did not do that the first time, and I felt the bread was too hard. Thank you for a great recipe

This was a hit in the Evenson household .. I left out the basil, used a mix of black and Greek olives some leftover garlic bread ( that I warmed in the oven ) and a thin sliced white onion .. let the mixture set at room temperature for the aloud time and served on a bed of roman lettuce leaves .. will make again

I loved this recipe. I was cooking for two so I made some modifications. Rather than Italian bread, I used one cup of plain croutons. I did mix them in olive oil and minced garlic and baked them on 200 degrees until brown. After I removed them from the oven, I shaved asiago cheese over them. 

Rather than green olives, I used black. Just a matter of preference. I also shaved asiago into the salad to taste and some over the top for decoration.   I do have a picture of it but it's too large to upload. If anyone would like to see it, feel free to email me at ljs4141@aol.com. Also foodie friends are always welcome!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I used Pain de Campagne, a country French bread I had made a few days earlier.  The only changes I made was to substitute the black olives for the  green and green onions for the red.  Loved it.

I used half a loaf of Artisan bread cut in fairly large cubes, cooking until toasted took a little longer but they stayed crunchy when mixed with the dressing. I used black instead of green olives and a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts and since garden tomatoes are not ripe sundried tomatoes. As for the fat content folks it is olive oil so good for you get over the numbers and remember what you are eating.

This Recipe is incredible. I used cherry tomatoes and halfed them. I also used less olive oil in the dressing. I found a mozzerella wrapped in proccutto that I cut in to small chunks I also added quite a bit of baby spinach just to make it healthier. Yummy!!!!!!!

Really amazing! I used a loaf of whole wheat instead of regular... 
So I had this left over salad from the night before. Lettuce, arugula, and celery. So, I tossed it together with this recipe and it was delicious. 
I also used grape tomatoes.
Hell yeah.

Everybody loved it.  My kid even said it was "awesome" but then he only ate the bread & left the veggies.  Oh well... I had to use ciabata bread because I couldn't keep a french loaf in the house for 24 hrs (so it would be hard) w/out it getting eaten!

Do not hesitate to make this delicious salad. So full of flavor. I mixed my dressing in the food processor. I added fresh spinach along with the basil. I make it about 45 minutes before serving so all the flavors meld and the bread develops a perfect chewy consistency. Everyone loved it!

Thank you Veggiemom for posting this recipe.  I just made this for the first time and it was amazing.  There was nothing left!  I did not have any mozzarella so I left it out and have to say that I think for us it was better without. I will definitely be making this again!!

Wow, delicious!! The only thing I did differently was omitted the olives since I don't like them. I will be making this over and over again!

I made this dish for a party without the onions. I wasn't sure about the green olives, but they turned out to be one of my favorite components. There was barely a crumb left by the end of the party.

I want to give this 3 1/2 stars.  It has flavor, but it wasn't my favorite.  I don't think this recipe is very good for you if you have a weak tummy.  The purple onion and green olives were too much for me.

Everyone loved this!  Unstead of Italian I bought Ciabata that was day old.  The salad was still good the next day- the bread didn't turn mushy.  I also added a bag of baby spinach leaves to it.  Tonight I am making it again because everyone wanted me to bring it tomorrow.

this was very good and a terrific way to recycle leftover homemade bread. i chose this recipe over the others because of the bread cube toasting instructions. i used kalamata olives, halved cherry tomatoes, and left out the cheese entirely. this was great with baked spaghetti pie

This was a great salad! I didnt think it would be so good since there was bread, but the bread was the best part! I do how ever recomend to sliming down the basil and red onion, they was a little strong-unless you like a lot of flavor go for it=)

Delicious. I didn't have fresh mozzarella handy, so I used queso fresco. I also used red, yellow and green tomatoes for extra color. Fantastic way to use stale bread and the mountain of tomatoes that from the garden this time of year. My french bread rolls were so hard, I had to saw at them with a bread knife, but I think that really helped the croutons stay crisp much longer than I expected (over 24 hours).  Next time I'll add marinated artichokes and maybe capers. I wish I had remembered panzanella when I was pregnant and craving bruschetta at all hours - this is a much more convenient way to enjoy that flavor!

This salad looks amazing, but tastes only okay.  The bread got soggy and my family thought the cheese was just kind of a filler - cold mozzarella is unimpressive. Everything else was fine, but the other ingredients are all standards for the every day Spanish salad, so we weren´t wowed.

I have made a similar recipe for years; instead of cheese and olives, add drained tuna.  It is so good; makes the perfect summer meal.  Have brought this to covered dish parties and people love it.

This was great. I didn't use olives and forgot to buy the basil so I didn't use that either. I used 3 day old bakery hoagie rolls. This is a salad that needs to be eaten right away. I doubt that it'll be good as leftovers.

I just made it for the second time.  I love the original recipe but, found a shortcut.  I used some premium croutons and used Feta cheese the second time around.  Any way you do it, it's a winner : )

This was really good, my husband especially liked it.  They loved the bread along with the fresh flavors of basil and mozerella.  I think I will try this with feta also sometime.

SUCH a wonderful salad!  Served it with grilled chicken & it was a big hit.  I cut the bread up a few hours before hand to make it extra crunchy before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This was an easy dish to make.  I used ciabatta bread which was perfect after I toasted it.  I also added small mozzerella balls that I cut in half to the salad.  I left out the olives which didn't seem to matter because the salad still came out good.  It kind of reminds me of a tomato caprese salad/bruschetta.  I served the salad with a roasted chicken. I would definitely make this dish again and my boyfriend said it's a keeper!

OK, Wow. I was looking for something to do with the tomatoes and basil in the fridge (I know, an easy combo) that wasn't the usual Caprese. I whipped this up without Olives (just don't have any on hand) and now I have to wait until the Chicken is done. How on earth am I going to keep away from this delectable salad? Maybe I'll put it in the laundry room so it's out of site. I used garlic powder on the bread (no garlic on hand) and a high quality Olive Oil. I can't wait to share this one.

Very, very good. Used tomatoes and basil from our garden. I wouldn't even try to make this salad unless you can get really good tomatoes. Made as per the recipe, other than adding the bread at the last minute, because I like my bread really crunchy. It was great. Thanks!

Excellent! I made two minor changes: used cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and didn't use the olives, instead I sprinkled some capers in there. This is a keeper. My picky teenage daughter even loved it (she suggested to put in cubed chicken next time...hmmm!)

Served as a quick and easy lunch for my kidlets and I. Used garden fresh tomatoes (orange cherry, red grape, yellow pear) and fresh garden basil.

Fantastic!  You could easily make the tomato mixture and bread cubes the day before and toss together just before serving.  I left out the olives because hubby hates them, sundried tomatoes would make a nice replacement.  I used cherry tomatoes cut in half, I think they look nicer.

LOVE this salad. I make it once a week. I used fresh bread and it turned out ok. I also added green peppers, red peppers and black olives. Keeping it simple is good too as it has some amazing flavors in it. Great with sirloin skewers.

Very nice salad!  I added romaine to help it stretch--I didn't have enough bread for a full recipe and had guests coming over for a bbq.  I also didn't shred the basil and just tore up a bunch of it and tossed it in.  I'm now realizing I forgot the olives, which I personally miss, but a lot of the guests don't like olives so I guess it's all good.  Very easy and good.  One person kept picking out the croutons and eating those--I guess he found those a hit!  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

We really enjoy this salad. I do cheat by mixing in store bought seasoned croutons in place of the toasted bread to the vegetable mix just before serving. I also use grape tomatoes, baby mozzarella, and fresh basil.

hmmm... well, wanted to love it as much as others. My husband liked it, a neighbor loved it. I thought it was lacking. I think this will be better in summer, for some reason my tomatoes got mushy. I think next time I'll used marinated mozzarella, trader joes has a spicy one I really like. The home made croutons rocked, I will make those whenever I want to "fancy" up a salad (typically I never use them).

My FAVORITE salad. I skip the olives, personal preference. There's a bread at the bakery in Super Walmart with sesame seeds on it that works perfectly in this salad.

We love this salad! The only change I made was to substitute black olives instead of green, only because of personal preference. It makes a lot of salad and I thought the leftovers would be too soggy but it actually tasted even better the next day. Looking forward to making this again.

Very tasty! We thought this was an excellent panzanella.  I will definitely make again.  I added paprika and oregano to the croutons.  Other than that I made no changes.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I am addicted to it!  The only thing I did differently was to use black olives instead of green ones.  I didn't have green one, but I think I like the milder taste of black olives with this salad anyway.  In addition, I used shreded mozarella instead of cubes because that's what I had.  I did go heavy on the mozarella, though. :)

This was fantastic.  I sustituted the olives for cucumbers.  I would not suggest mixing the dressing in until just before you plan to serve it.  Otherwise, the bread becomes a little mushy.  (This however did not stop me from scarfing down the leftovers the next day.)

I love all of the ingredients in this salad!  The olives were such a great addition to a somewhat classic.  I did keep my bread out until just before serving to keep it a little more crispy.  I also toasted my bread twice once without the stuff on it and the next time the way written.  I do think this helped the bread from getting soggy.  Great recipe and was loved by everyone.

I omitted the olives, and threw in some semi-peeled chunks of English cucumber. Also used white balsamic vinegar, and Thai basil (I love that aniseed flavor). Really nice salad. With a couple of tangy pickled beets on the side, this made for a great lunch. Next time I'll mix some arugula into the mix. Thanks, veggiemom!

Very delicious! I did not use olives. I added vidalia onion instead of red.  Adding a little Italian seasoning dressing would have been a nice addition and next time I will add it.  It was a hit at our picnic - did well for the few hours it was out.  I was afraid it would be too soggy to enjoy, but it was even more yummy with a little softness to it.  Be sure to make your own crutons - that's a must for the integrity of the salad!! Yum!

This has become our FAVORITE dish when guests visit.  I've also brought it to work a few times and absolutely everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe.  I think I use just a little more mozzarella than the recipe calls for, but it is easy to adjust to taste.  The capers make a perfect addition and add a little salty zing to the dish.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!!

The flavours of this salad were great, however, it tasted too oily for me. Next time I will toast the bread without coating it in oil and I will mix the garlic in with the dressing. Or, I could rub the bread with a clove of garlic before breaking into pieces and toasting.

I feel like a broken record, but, all I can say is WOW!  What a terrific, and healthy salad.  I never made my own croutons before, but now that I know how easy it is, I will from now on.
