As a boy in NY, I grew up on these. In my neighborhood, they used ice-cold milk, and whipped it with the syrup in a blender before adding it to the seltzer water.  My favorite was the Vanilla Egg Cream (egg creams were not necessarily Chocolate). Today, I make them with the Torani Vanilla (-not- French Vanilla) syrup.

This is great!  The only change I made was using light cream or half-n-half. and club soda. I mixed the cream and chocolate syrup in glass, added ice to top and poured the club soda on top. Unbelievably refreshing.  It's not bad with a splash of Kahlua too.

First, you have to use Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup.  Start by pouring a little less than 2 oz. of whole milk(has to be whole milk) into a soda glass.  Then add seltzer to fill the glass 1/3 of the way.  Stir the milk and seltzer.  Then add more seltzer until it reaches the very top of the glass.  Then pour 2 oz. of chocolate syrup down the side of the glass.  Only stir the bottom of the glass where the chocolate is sitting.  Stir until a foamy head appears and the drink has turned brown.  And it tastes nothing like a fizzy chocolate milk.  I hate chocolate milk but love egg creams.

I guess you must have grown up with these to appreciate them. I didn't, and wasn't impressed in anyway. This was...flat tasting. I love chocolate sodas, I'll stick with them. Thanks anyway.

Fizzy chocolate milk. If you don't like chocolate milk and if you don't like fizz then this isn't for you. If you do then you can appreciate this taste of NY. The fizz lightens the thickness of the milk if your wondering.

Chocolate Egg Creams were made exclusively with Fox's U-Bet chocolate syrup.  Fox's has a flavor which is markedly different from any other brand, and is still being created in Brooklyn, NY.  Once you've tried it, you won't go back, I promise! Coffee, and Vanilla  Egg Creams were also available at the soda fountains.  The good old days!  This recipe uses far too much milk and not nearly enough seltzer in my opinion.

Never had an egg cream. Tried this one and I love it. I used store brand club soda and chocolate sauce. Made a coffee version using Autocrat coffee syrup which was also great.

Good recipe and true to its simple New York roots. Best to use seltzer from a siphon and Fox's u-bet chocolate syrup.  The proportions in this recipe are good.  The milk and the seltzer should be very cold.

It was good a nice substitute for just plain chocolate milk but a little bitter. I didnâ€™t have any seltzer water and used club soda instead. Will make again and use more chocolate syrup.

I think I ended up using a little more seltzer to taste, but it's the right amount of milk - and some use too little milk. Yummy.

This was very weird and made my stomach feel funny. I think that there was too much fat in the milk.

As a Native New Yorker, this recipe is awesome! I used Hershey syrup, because that was the only one I could find, but other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone!
