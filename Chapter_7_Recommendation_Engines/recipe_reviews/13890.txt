This was super easy and fun to make! I added green chiles, black olives, corn, and shredded up some rotisserie chicken and layered it on as I saw fit, topping each layer with cheese. I also used low fat refried beans, low fat black beans, and low fat mexican cheese to make it that much more healthy! After it came out of the oven, I put some sliced avocado and tomatoes on, and it was a hit! My boyfriend couldn't get enough (in fact writing this review makes me want to whip one up right now!!!) Give it a try tonight!

I made a few modifications.  One, I added half a packet of taco seasoning to the pinto bean mixture.  Second, I used refried black beans instead of the regular black beans in the mixture.  Third, I added cumin to the black bean mixture for extra seasoning.  Finally, I used mostly Monterrey Jack and Pepper Jack cheeses instead of most of the cheddar.  This turned out pretty well with the changes, but was still a little dry.  However, a little bit of salsa and sour cream on the top fixed that.  I think I'll be making this again, and in the meantime try to think of some more changes to make it even better.  I think I'll try to add some black olives and other vegetables to it.

With a few changes as suggested by others, this recipe was delicious!  I used a can of refried Pinto beans instead of the canned Pintos in the recipe, spicy salsa, chopped jalapenos in both bean mixtures, a layer of beef with taco seasoning and onions.  I baked the bottom 4 tortillas a little bit beforehand to keep them from getting soggy, and baked the whole thing in a springform pan.

This is a FAVORITE in our house.  We have one friend who asks for this dish every time that he comes over for dinner.  I have found that Rosarita refried beans are the exact consistency that is created by that tedious mashing of the pinto beans, so I use them.  I also add quite a bit more cilantro and a can of sliced black olives, and used extra picante sauce or a can of rotel instead of the tomatoes.  I have added taco meat once when our meat-loving friend ate with us, and it turned out well.  All in all, with the changes... SUPERB.  Without them... okay, but kinda bland.

I have made my version of this recipe for years using lowfat Mexi-blend cheese,refried beans,corn,and shredded chicken breast.  I spice things up and eliminate the dryness by using canned enchilada sauce on each layer and on top before covering and baking.  It cooks up like stacked enchiladas!  It is one of my family's favorite dishes.

I used larger tortillas and a springform pan, which worked really well to hold all the layers. I also used fat-free refried beans instead of the mashed pintos, a mixture of cheddar and jack cheeses, and, being a carnivore, added a layer of diced chicken breast sauteed in taco seasoning right in the middle. With some sweet corn cake, this dish made a great meal.

What a great dish. I used low fat tortillas and fat free refried beans also added a 4 oz can of green chiles to the black bean mixture to give them a little more flavor. I will be making this again!

This recipe looks delicious and I plan to try it with a twist; instead of baking, making it into a salad! Replace the tortillas with crushed corn chips and add some lettuce. Yum! Nice cool summer salad, filling enough for a meal!

Small recommendation ... use a springform pan that's been sprayed with non-stick spray.  Makes for a fast and easy perfect presentation.

I loved it!  My whole family loved it.  And who ever I have cooked it for has loved it.  I've made it at least 20 times now and have perfected the recipe.  I use 1 15oz can of refried beans instead of the pinto beans.  And use only 5 tortillas.  It becomes high enough even with that.  So I divide the mixture up accordingly.  When I first made it and used 2 cans of pinto beans, it was too beany.  The proportion didn't seem right.  My husband has liked it ever since I cut down the beans.  It's so healthy too.  I use Whole Wheat tortillas.

Excellent! Followed the advice of others: 1. used shredded chicken, mixed with a little salsa, as the center layer. Because of this extra layer I added 5 minutes to the cooking time. 2. baked three tortillas for 5 minutes so the bottom layers would not get soggy 3. used Tex-Mex cheese. 4. used a 9" spring form pan. The only change I would make is to add more cilantro...just personal preference.

So easy, fun, and yummy! My husband barely swallowed his first bite before saying "wow, this is really good! You need to make this next time we have someone over!" I substituted a can of corn for a can of the pinto beans, and added some cumin to a few of the layers. Next time I will probably throw in a chopped jalapeño to add a little heat, at the request of my hubby. :-) highly recommend!

This recipe is surprisingly delicious! I made a few substitions since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used one can of fat free refried beans instead of pinto beans,  canned tomatoes with chopped chilies instead of plain tomato and   I excluded the cilantro. I topped each slice with salsa, sour cream, guacamole and sliced black olives to serve. YUM!

Interesting presentation - and yummy! I too made changes to suit our tastes. I added an extra layer with a 1/2 lb of lean ground beef with taco seasonings. Substituted a can of Rotel (mostly drained) for the salsa. And added sauteed corn and peppers into the black bean mixture. 

I piled this all up in a 9" springform pan and since I had preheated the beans some - I baked uncovered for approx. 20 min.

A very tasty and versatile recipe - thanks!

this was very very good!  i added an envelope of taco seasoning split between the two bean mixtures, and used a tin of vegetarian refried beans instead of mashing pinto beans.  I used a drained tin of Ro-Tel tomatoes with lime and cilantro instead of fresh tomatoes, and used a lot more cheese---we're cheese lovers at our house!  I thought the suggestion of a springform pan was very clever, so i did that and it came out terrific;  would give 4.5 stars if i could, with 1/2 a star off for being a bit stodgy.  Still delicious, filling, and easy!  Thank you!

This was okay but I thought it was very bland as written.  It had way too many beans for us but I will make it again and add quite a few things.  We like jalapeno peppers so that will definitely go in along with some chopped onion, seasoned shredded or ground beef and rotel tomatoes.  I'll also eliminate the pinto beans and just use the black beans.  Avacado would also be great sliced on top as illustrated in some of the photos.  This recipe has so much potential and thankfully we can all adjust it to our own individual taste.  I used a springform pan and it worked very well.

I love this recipe.  During Lent, when I abstain from meat, I prepare it exactly as written, and it is wonderful.  At other times of the year, I throw in a bit of seasoned beef or chicken and it is great that way too.  Instead of mashing pinto beans, I'll often buy a can of fat free refried beans, and they work great too.  Or I've used all black beans, which I love.  It all turns out great.  Thanks for a neat recipe.

This was really good and we used lo-fat cheese and just half as much to help reduce the calories and fat content.

Quick and simple recipe but it is missing something.  I didn't have cilantro and used more salsa that I thought would of gave it more punch but it didn't.  I already had this in the oven before I read reviews. I think I will try taco seasoning next time like some reviewers tried and that might help.  I used refried beans and black beans and the Mexican Blend shredded cheese.  I could only layer it 4 times for I don't have a deep dish pie plate and I put a flour tortilla on top last to be like a top crust and so the cheese wouldn't stick to the foil when baking. It tastes alright but a little too much beans and needs more salsa and cheese and possibly the Taco seasoning next time or taco meat.  I don't like black beans but my husband does.  I think I will also try it with shredded lettuce, more tomatoes, salsa, green onions and sour cream for toppings next time.

This dish was pretty good and very easy to make. Spray the bottom of the dish with a non-stick spray to prevent the bottom tortilla from sticking. I doubled the amount of cilantro to make sure I could taste it and next time, I may add even more. Spend the extra money for fresh cilabtro, the dried stuff just doesn't taste as good.

Love this! So easy and freezes well for reheat. I made it with meat and a 5 pepper blend for kick and added olives, diced tomatoes, green pepper and corn. Outrageously good! Will bake the tortillas next time for crispiness...the possibilites for this are endless, shredded chicken, etc.

This was excellent!  I did opt to use re-fried beans instead of pinto beans and next time I'd add a fresh jalapeno to the re-fried beans also.

This recipe is a "regular" for us now. We call it "21-layer Tortilla Tower;" a pie plate isn't tall enough to hold it! We use a round casserole dish. Thanks for sharing!

It was good, but with my modifications it was definitely a 5 star! Add some taco seasoning to the pinto beans (about a half packet), and used Rotel canned tomatoes and green chilies (for lack of fresh). I also added some lime juice to the black bean mixture and some fresh jalapeno. It was quite yummy! Without those, it was a little bland.

I used a spring form pan and only 5 tortillas in layering by the time I reached the top of the pan. Had left over ingredients, so I mad a couple burritos with the extras. My husband, who normally doesn't like Mexican food said this was really good. I added some diced black olives to the top to make it look more appealing.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and it was a huge success. I used dried beans and soaked them overnight as I'm not fond of the preserving liquid. We're vegetarians but our friends didn't even realise that there was no meat on the table.

I had quite a few improvements here - I used a 9x13 inch pan and simply layered them one sort of over the other and used 8 tortillas - I did prebake them for about 10 minutes then took off 2 at a time and used another 9x13 pan to assemble in. Peel off tortillas 2 x 2 from the oven.  They won't be as soggy in the end.  I used a can of refried beans instead ( approx half a can or depending on how much you like ) and smeared that on the bottom of each.  I assembled some taco meat w/ a low sodium seasoning packet (approx 1.5# beef) In separate bowl I combined one can of rotel tomatoes ( drained ) one can of chopped tomatoes (drained ) one can of black beans (drained) a dash of cumin, 2 minced garlic cloves, a dash of chili powder and a can of FIESTA NACHO CHEESE SOUP from Campbell's - combined altogether this made it really stick together nicely.  One layer of refried beans, a small layer of seasoned beef and one layer of tomato mixture - a tiny bit of shredded cheese and continue.  I baked for 50 minutes on 400 and served w/ tortilla chips, salsa, topped w/ lettuce at the end and sour cream.  HEAVEN!

I'm a vegetarian. My husband is not.  Finding things to cook that make us both happy isn't always easy.  This is so fantastic it's gone into my regular rotation!

Amazing!!! Rave reviews from the whole family! In fact, oldest son begged us not to send all the leftovers in Dad's lunch so he could have more later. I baked four tortillas in the oven as it preheated.  I used two cans of refried beans instead of the pinto beans. One would have sufficed. I added green onions to the black bean mix.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  And I topped it with avocado slices after I took it out of the oven.  YUM!

SOOOO GOOD! I took some others advice and added a can of green chilis to the black bean mixture, mixed some pepperjack cheese to the cheddar, added an exta teas. of garlic, 1/2 teas. of cumin and baked the first four tortillas as well. Next time I will use a layer of veggie meat too. I ended up putting this in a casserole dish instead of a pie plate and it worked very well! Just make sure you use a deep one!

My 11 yr.old daughter and I played with this recipe and took some suggestions from other reviewers.  It was delicious!!  I cut the tortillas in strips, thought it would be easier to serve (and it was).  Don't be afraid to throw in whatever you have.  I added a can of green chilis, this made the taste!  Also a little cumin, which I love in mexican food.  I also layered in 1 lb. of browed ground beef drained and seasoned with an env. of taco seasoning.  I layered it all in a deep 13x9 pan to feed my hungry family.  We ate the whole thing!!  No leftovers with this one, my kids, 6,11, 14 LOVED it!  Have fun with it, you can't mess it up!
2008- This recipe is still a regular in our home, we love it and the leftovers are great!
2010- Still making this on a regular basis, had it tonight for dinner, just love it!

A good, easy recipe.  I agree with previous reviews - heat the fillings before assembling (it didn't heat all the way through even after 50 minutes), and add onions and/or other seasonings.  This recipe is a 'regular' now.

We have this often as a quick meal during the week. I often make two pies - one for the kids as written, and one for the adults with an added layer of sauteed vegetables (eggplant, peppers, and onions). Try it with corn tortillas!

I have a two year old and another one on the way, so I developed a speed method for this great recipe!  Use refried beans instead of the mashed pintos, and use a can of rotel dip (plus a tablespoon of taco seasoning for an extra kick) in the black bean layer instead of chopping tomatos.  I still added the garlic and salsa.  I added a can of drained corn to the black bean mixture, and had more than enough for a 5 layer pie! My family LOVED it!

Super good.  I added jalapeno peppers in mine.  I also split the recipe into two pies - each with about 4-5 layers or so.  I was afraid the 7 layers would topple over in my oven.

This is a yummy recipe - easy to prepare, also good for preparing ahead. I added ground beef (seasoned with burrito seasoning) to every layer. Great main dish!

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few changes to suit my tastes, but this is such a great recipe in and of itself!
First, I reduced the amount of cheddar and replaced it with pepper jack cheese, then I added some cumin and some smoked paprika (I REALLY like the smoky flavor - if you aren't that into it, just leave out the paprika), added 1 more TBSP of cilantro, mixed 1 small can of green chilies in with the tomatoes, added some roasted red peppers (I roasted them myself, but it can be time consuming, so you can use a jar, too), and I didn't use flour tortillas. La Tortilla Factory makes some tortillas that are a corn and flour mix. They are super delicious and I find that they hold up better than anything else in recipes that have a lot of moisture. They are small, so they'll overlap if you don't trim the centers - also a little time consuming, but SO worth it!

Wow. Wow. I'm hooked. I took others' advice and baked the tortillas before layering. I added corn and a quarter of an onion I had left in the fridge. I also used chopped jar garlic because I'm lazy :). I have lots of leftovers and I'm very happy... Love it!

This turned out awesome. I used fat free refried beans, added a can of corn, used rotel in place of tomatoes and added a can of green chilis. Sooo good. The only thing I'll change next time is to use maybe a can and a half of refried beans instead of two whole cans.

My family loves this recipe. Being different from the norm when it comes to Mexican food night in our house made this fun. Depending how many we have to feed I sometimes use 10 or 12 inch tortillas and add extra ingredients. I've changed the ingredients around some too,I use refried beans instead of mashing pintos to save time. I add spices, such as taco seasoning and cumin and garlic to both the black bean and refried bean mix. Also chop up an avacodo and add to one of the mixes. I have added a layer of beef or chicken before, but really cant tell its there. My man suggested using tortilla chips or doritos in place of the soft shells for some texture. (I'm not sure they would still be crunchy at the end though). And I always use reduced or ff ingredients if available. Still tastes great.

This was wonderfully Mexican and a great vegetarian meal. I used WW tortillas as others suggested and the texture was perfect. I substituted one can of refried beans for one can of pinto beans. I also added garlic salt, onion powder and cumin to each of the layer mixtures (for more spice, since others said it may be too bland). Finally, I added black olives to the black bean mixture. This was perfect! I even served it in a church potluck and the layers looked beautiful. Oh.... I could only fit 5 layers also and so made 2 pie dishes with one recipe.

This is my 100th review!  And it's a kepper!  I'm slowly introducing healthier foods to my family and with recipes like this, it is easy to do.  I followed some recommendations of others and used whole wheat tortillas, added corn and green peppers to the black bean mixture and I used 1 can of refried beans in place of the pintos. The entire family and an invited guest loved it.  This is sure to be in our regular rotation because my favourite part is how simple it is to prepare.

Quite good! I knew it wouldn't be spicy enough for us so I used drained RoTel instead of the fresh tomatoes and added generous amount of cumin to the pinto beans. Because of the comments about soggy tortillas, I tried using whole wheat tortillas and they held up very well...healthier too!

The dish I used was slightly smaller than the tortillas.  This made it very easy for all ingredients to stay in place.  I also used a little non-stick cooking spray in the bottom as suggested, and nothing stuck.  Finally, I didn't mash the pinto beans, and it turned out just fine.  Great vegetarian recipe, and a nice change from tacos.

Loved it- definitely need the green chilies, though.  And I'd do less garlic and more cilantro next time. Maybe a little cumin instead of garlic...

This is a great recipe. My two year old loved it. I added green chiles to the black bean mixture. Next time I might add some chopped jalapenos to spice it up even more. Great topped with guacamole, sour cream, and more chopped tomatoes!

Five Star plus! This was one of the best things I've made from allrecipes. I used D's Salsa recipe, also from this site, for the salsa. We ate it up very quickly. Highly recommended.

I followed the suggestion of others and used my springform pan which worked out great.  I also used refried beans mixed with a package of taco seasoning and I added chopped onions to the tomato mixture.  My daughter loved it and said I had "outdone" myself!

I won't make this again.  It had a good flavor, but was really mushy in texture which made it kind of gross.  My parents really didn't like it either, and we all found something else to eat afterwords because it was so unsatisfying.

My son requested "mexican" food for his 16th birthday party.  We had a HUGE crowd of adults, teenagers and very young people and everyone loved this recipe.  I read through all reviews and decided to make my pies (15) with chicken, beef, chorizo and bean.  I agree, use refried beans, it's much easier.  Served with corn cake, mexican rice, chips, mixed fruit and flan and nothing was left.  Living in San Diego we have wonderful salsa and seasonings available year round and they complimented this food perfectly.  I will make this again and again.

I had a few minutes while my son was behaving and went to work on this dish, which promised a 15 minute prep time.  However, took me an hour to prepare and seemed to make a real mess!  I did the springform pan (a MUST), added cumin, extra cilantro, used refried bean in lieu of one can pinto beans.  This recipie was delicious and VERY filling, and cheap to make.  Made for my carnivore hubby and veggie friend - all loved - could only have one wedge and were all full.  Would make again - beautiful presentation - really fun.  Sour cream and salsa on the side is needed for maximum enjoyment!

Family hit!  They were actually licking their plates:)  Although, I used a large pie dish and didn't have room for 7 tortilla shells, only used 5, and only used the left over pintos I had, I would not have had enough room for the black bean layers.  I also added a little taco seasoning to the beans and cooked it for 25 min. at 400

This was fantastic and not hard to make. It's also really filling. I deviated from the recipe a little. I cooked ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning. Separately I cooked a mixture of tomato, green onion, red pepper and yellow pepper in butter. When I layered the soft taco shells I did a layer of meat with salsa and shredded cheese, then the next layer was meat with the peppers, onion and tomato mixture and shredded cheese and then repeated the layers until my mixture ran out. I poured some salsa over top of the finished product and sprinkled more cheese and then baked. Each piece received a dollop of sour cream on top just before serving. I served each piece with a side of rice mixed with lentils. It was amazing looking and tasting. What impressed me the most with this was how easily it was to slice and dish out. I thought it might be messy or difficult but it wasn't at all. It sliced up just like soft butter and stayed together perfectly just as a lasagna would. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

Could not be easier! Add some greens like spinach or kale to the black bean mixture for some extra calcium and iron.

Yum yum yum so easy and cool looking too. I've seen this kind of recipe for years and never tried it...wish I had sooner. I sautéed peppers and onions may add chilies next time. Added a little chili powder and garlic salt but not needed this would be great as written for sure

Made this dish the other day for a party I was hosting and it is absolutely delicious!  I couldn't find canned pinto beans so used canned refried beans instead.  I also used a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar. The package of tortillas I bought had 12 tortillas in it so I decided to make 2-6 layer pies.  Fun and easy to put together and the house smelled amazing while it was baking.  This was a huge hit at the party and I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for posting.

I have to give this 5 stars even though I made some changes. I think following the recipe as written would be perfect too! We had left over Carnitas (pork)so, I added a layer of the meat in the middle. Also used two cans of Rosarita refried beans in stead of mashing pinto beans and a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. There's enough of both mixtures left over to make another small tortilla pie!!! The tortillas were heated on a dry skillet before using. I baked it in a spring-form pan, but won't do that again...a terrible mess as the first tortilla stuck to the bottom and all the juices burnt into the pan. I should have known to grease the pan! I also think the next size up for the tortillas would be a good idea.

This was delicious and very easy. I added black olives to each layer, and I used a mix of cheddar and pepper jack. I didn't have room for all the layers, and I topped the top tortilla with cheese, olives, and tomatoes (no beans; I thought that would be too messy). My pintos were too firm to mash, so next time I'll probably use lard-free refried beans to keep the layers together better. A definite keeper, though!

Very nice,especially the next day cold out of the fridge when it was easier to cut.Cold i liked the taste better because of the very strong taste of the chouriço.Next time i will do half chouriço and half minced meat i think.

Delicious!!!!  I did modify as suggested by others.  I added chopped green chilies, ground beef with taco seasoning, refried beans in place of the pinto and black beans, added enchilada sauce, used tace chesse instead of cheddar, and also used corn tortillas instead of flour and baked them for 5 minutes.  Even my picky 12 year old daugher cleaned her plate!!!!

I made this and it was delicious!  I used my homemade salsa and also added ground beef (that I fried up with onions, garlic and jalapenos) to each of the layers. I also used refried beans because I didn't have pinto beans.

This is one of my families favorites. One modification I make is to use 1 lb ground beef mixed with 4 T taco seasoning instead of the beans.  I also add a small can of sliced black olives to the mixture.  In addition I use taco cheese between the tortilla and meat layers. Delicious!

Could probably have been a 4 had I followed some of the other cooks suggestions, but I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it was kind of bland.  I had a couple of vegetarians over for dinner who seemed to really like it though.

My family raved about this dish!  However, I made some significant changes.  Seven layers just seemed like too many for one pie pan, so I made two pies with five layers each.  I added corn, extra tomatoes, and a little fresh spinach to the black bean mixture.  I used refried beans instead of pinto beans, and I added a little taco meat to that mixture (although the vegetarian pie was a little more popular).  The final product looked great and tasted even better!

This was a hit. I toasted the tortillas in the oven and spread the bean mixtures on before stacking them in a springform pan.  This recipe was very adaptable since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used the two different types of beans and added  salsa to one and guac to the other, with lots of cheese of course!

I was really excited to try this since I'm always looking for good vegetarian recipes but was a little disappointed.  It was still a little too rich for my taste even though I added corn and green chiles due to others reviews.  It was still good so I am giving it four stars but I may try to cut back on the cheese next time.  Oh and also used one can of refried beans instead of two cans pinto beans due to personal taste.

Very good!  I like that this is easily adaptable to what we have available in the pantry.  For the middle tortillas, I used corn tortillas (we only had a couple flour tortillas left); also, for both the flour and corn tortillas, I was a little concerned that my husband would find them to be too soggy with all the other ingredients, so I first put them on a dry frying pan at medium heat until they were just a little crunchy and brown, and then assembled the pie.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy to make, and very tasty!  When I went to the store, I forgot to get the salsa, so I had to make my own.  I just used some canned diced tomato with garlic and onion, some fresh diced onion, lime juice, cilantro, and the other 1/2 cup of the diced tomato called for in the recipe.  My 8-yr old mashed the beans while I made the salsa.  Everyone loved it, and so did I!

The whole family loved this, right down to the one-year-old.  We added some sliced black olives to the top.  I had good luck cooking it in a springform pan and I recommend spraying the foil with cooking spray so that the cheese doesn't stick to it.

VERY GOOD!  I like the fact that this is a meatless recipe.  The flavors were great.  We prepared this exactly as written and the proportions came out perfectly.  Didn't have anything left over when we were done assembling the pie.  We will be having this again.

YUMMY! This dish was warming and filling. The beans were sweet, and when served with extra salsa it was the perfect family meal. Just as a warning: this dish isn't pretty by any stretch of the imagination. You might want to refrain from serving it to guests or to those you wish to impress.

Okay, not great.  The salsa really dominates the flavor.  I would recommend the black bean lasagna from this site instead of this.

This was so good!  I altered it a bit and layered refried beans, pinto beans, black olives, 3 different cheeses and homemade salsa.  It was so tasty and I will definitely make it again!

My non-vegetarian husband and his friend loved this dish.  I'm making it for a potluck this Saturday, too.  I serve it with some avacado on top for a little extra flavor.

OK, but why not just make a bean burrito with some of the same ingredients and save time?  Also, a pie plate is way too short to hold all of the ingredients - I had to use 2 pie plates.  If I do make this again, I will definitely add more ingredients to give it more flavor, and cut the recipe by half to make it fit in one pie plate.  Otherwise, good idea...

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I often use red pepper or sun-dried tomato tortillas for some extra kick.  The black bean mixture is especially tasty, and could be used on its own as a salsa.

Very good!  It took about ten minutes longer to bake than the recipe said.  I also added more cilantro, into the recipe and on the side.  Next time I would also add more cheese!  (but I'm a cheese freak!)  Easy prep and once it's in the oven you don't need to think about it until the timer dings.  I will definately make it again.

We liked this at my house. Mine came out to be 5 layers instead of 7 layers but I had bigger than 8" tortillas on hand. I agree that it was a little bland and next time I make this I'll use a spicer salsa and maybe use the recipe for black bean and corn salad II, also on this site, as the filling. BF added some hot sauce to it when he ate it and thought it was great.

Excellent.  I added lime juice to the bean mixture, used a full can of corn and a small can of diced green chiles.  Plus I also layered it with seasoned ground beef.  I baked the tortillas for 5 minutes first to get them crisp.  This all was a great balance of flavors.  Will definitely make again.

This is probably a good recipe for finicky kids, but rather bland for the adult population. It tasted like "bean pie".  I would probably add taco meat, more tomatoes and maybe some olives or jalapenos and maybe two kinds of cheeses next time.

My kids asked to take the leftovers in their lunches tomorrow. That says it all! I'll definitely make this one again with a couple of tweaks. I think I'll make a quick batch of refried beans instead of just pintos. I'll also lower the oven temperature (375° F) and go a little longer. Delicious!

This is one of those miracle recipes that is reasonably healthy, tastes great, budget friendly, easy to make, and easy to customize. Definitely a go to on those nights when you are just too tired to cook. I had some left over fresh made salsa from taco take-out the night before so I used that, I put the green salsa in the pintos and the red salsa in the black beans. You can find salsa verde (green salsa) at the store and it is made with tomatillos, onion, garlic, and jalapeno. It has a tart/tangy kick that paired well with the roasted flavor of the traditional red salsa. I also layered some corn in there for added flavor and vegetables. I only needed 3 tortillas to do my layering as I have a shallow pie dish and it came out perfect. I served it with a frozen vegetable mix (broccoli, carrot, squash, and cauliflower) which I sauteed in olive oil, butter, and garlic about half way through the bake time. Would pair equally well with calabacitas: sauteed onion, squash, and corn (frozen is fine, green chiles optional). If you like you can substitute whole wheat tortillas too! Garnished mine with sour cream, chopped green onions, and chopped fresh cilantro. Again a must try recipe and one to keep in your arsenal for those hectic tired evenings.

Really good. I switched the proportions to two cans of black beans to one of pinto. I also added a little more cheese. I also needed to bake it for about 50-55 minutes, otherwise it was still a little cool in the center. Good recipe!

I made this easy casserole for our dinner last night. I really like that this recipe is quite versatile in what you can do with it. I replaced the two cans of pinto beans with one can of fat free refried beans. I used low sodium black beans, and canned diced tomatoes with green chilies, instead of fresh tomatoes. The cheese I used was Monterey jack. I added half a taco seasoning packet to each bean mixture, but I'm not sure it was needed. We topped this with sour cream, and salsa or taco sauce. I sliced this into eight servings, instead of 6, and that smaller serving was plenty. It worked beautifully in my covered, glass, round casserole dish. The kids really liked this, and we had no leftovers. This will become a regular in our house. This could easily be made with corn tortillas. I may make this when my son's friend, who has a wheat allergy, stays with us. He also has a dairy allergy, but the cheese could easily be left off. Then it could be placed on the table with other condiments for people to add as they wish. In the future, I think I will replace both the salsa and tomatoes with pico de gallo. I served this with a green salad, and it made the perfect Sunday night meal. It could easily be made ahead, ready to pop in the oven on busy weeknights. Olives, chicken, corn, avocados, and ground beef could be used to change it up.

Changes I made:

I sauteed one small onion then added the pinto beans (drained and rinsed) to the pan and smashed then and added Cumin to taste. I then added I can corn (drained and rinsed) and one can of original rotel (with liquid). Heated until most liquid evaporated. I heated the tortillas in a separate pan on stove, greased my pie dish then layered tortilla, bean mixture, sprinkled with cheese, sprinkled sliced black olives and chopped cilantro. Repeated until I ran out of bean mixture then topped with tortilla and cheese. Baked as directed. Served with sour cream. Really good.

MY SON ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!! Need I say anything more? This is a picky, fifteen year old who up to now has always said to me, 'Why don't  you cook American?'. He wants me to make this again and again. Oh, btw, you don't need 2 cans of beans to do this, I just used one can and it was refried beans.

I loved this recipe! I am vegetarian and was looking for something good like this. If you want to cook less, do only 2 layers and bake for 30 minutes.

Yum! And so filling.  I had enough ingredients to make one 7 layer and another 3 layer pie.  I used my own dry beans, both black and pinto, that I cooked up in a crock pot, giving me plenty of beans to spread amongst a full package of whole wheat tortillas. Good high fiber meal.

This one was a hit, except I couldn't fit all seven layers in my pie pan since I had some Italian sausage that I didn't have anything to do with so I just added it to this. I thought it might be strange, but it was surprisingly good! I'm sure it would have been great without the sausage as well, though!

This was pretty good, but I felt it needed more texture. Some crushed chips on top would probably make it better.

This was a good dish.  I feel it might have been a bit bland had I not put cumin and onions into the mix, and I will probably be slightly baking the tortillas before I layer them because mine ended up very soggy.  Overall, I liked the dish a lot, and I hope to make it again!

Very good for a vegetarian dish. Easy to make, and not too long to cook. Next time we're going to try it with a little Chorizo sausage to spice it up a bit.

Left out the tomatoes and salsa to prevent the pie from getting soggy in the fridge. Also prebaked the tortilla as others suggested. Fried some onions and jalapeno as well as the pinto and black into a thick mush adding a package of spicy taco seasoning and a cup of water. Mashed the beans and cooked the mixture until it was nice and thick.  Served the pie with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa as well as with a tossed side green salad. The pie tasted great, even reheated.

This was great but frustrating.  There was no way that all of these ingredients would fit into our pie pan.  Do others use very large pie pans or something special to make this dish?  I had to split it into 2 pie pans.  Was still great but agree with previous reviews that it needs some spice and flavor.  Will add some taco seasoning, peppers and more cilantro next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent dish! I made a few variations along the way: I added extra salsa, garlic cloves, a small white onion (diced) and tomatoes. I shredded two types of cheese between the layers. I seasoned the beans with bit of garlic powder, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and onion powder for more flavor. This was pretty easy to make and it looked really cool when I sliced it! My family loved it and we ate all of the leftovers too! I will definitely make this again!

Didn't have Pinto beans so used Borlotti beans (also known as cranberry beans by a few). Used gluten free tortillas and salsa and replaced the sour cream with natural yoghurt to cut through the possible stodginess.  Just lovely.

Made a vegan version of this, it was excellent! Used soy cheddar cheese & Tofutti's "better than sour cream". Also added avacado, chopped onion, olives, and a whole lot of hot sauce (on my personal dish anyway). Quick, easy, and tastes great!

This was a really good dish!  The only change that I think that I will make next time will be to pre-bake a six of the seven tortillas before assembling the dish so that the ones on the bottom and in the middle are a little crispier.

This got rave reviews from my husband and his dad who doesn't eat red meat.  I would have used refried beans like other reviewers suggested but didn't have any on hand so used 1 can of Heinz baked beans in tomato sauce instead to replace the 2 cans of pinto beans.  I mashed them up, added some taco seasoning and cumin and carried on with the recipe.  I also warmed the tortillas in the oven prior to putting the pie together so that they would be a bit crispy and not get soggy like some had complained of.  This helped a bit I think. Also had to cook longer than 40 minutes for the middle to heat up.  Served with guacamole, salsa, and jalapenos!!  Yum, YUM, YUMMY.  Thanks for the easier, vegetarian meal.

Loved this!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I used a slotted spoon when scooping the black bean tomato mixture, as that was quite watery.  The "stack" held up perfectly and after baking and I was able to serve it in pie-like wedges. Next time I might replace one of the pinto bean layers with a mixture of crumbled Boca and maybe some black olives. This recipe will lend itself to some creativity.

Incredibly delicious. It is really easy to add ingredients to this dish to make it your own - I included sweet corn and red onion in the pinto bean mixture and green chilies and sliced olives in the black bean mixture. Wonderful!!

I am only giving this dish one star, although, I feel it would be unfair to make a judgement after my first attempt at making this dish.  I don't know if it was my garlic or what, but, to me, the garlic was overwhelming!   I will try this one again, however, I will leave out the garlic.

This is a delicious entree. First time I added grilled chicken to the black bean layer (I substituted kidney beans) and the second time I used ground beef.  I also made my own refried beans-bit of a chore but worth it. Very good second day too.

Really good!  I substituted green onions for cilantro and mozarella for the cheddar...and it turned out great.  Guacamole and sour cream are a must for serving.

I add cooked chicken breast bits that I've marinated in a dressing of 1/4 cup lime juice, 2 TBSP of canola oil, 1 tsp of minced garlic, and black pepper.  I throw this in with the black bean layer, add cilantro, and lime zest.  Other than that, the only thing I've done to this recipe is use a can of refried beans instead of mashing the pinto beans.  My husband rates this recipe as "I'd ask for it by name."

This was interesting, we cooked it in a deep dish pie pan. I added olives to the top, and used whole wheat tortillas, they were definitely not soggy. This was a nice, simple dish on its own, next time I might add corn or shredded chicken. I only partially mashed the pinto beans, we like whole beans in our house.

I do not know of a pie plate that would hold anything this high! I placed mine in a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish that is about 4" high.  Guess what? It made that full plus a pie plate with a layer of each. It was good the first night, but since it made so much we had leftovers! The second night after reheating in the micro it was very dry.  Easy way to remedy that was to pour on the salsa!!!

I've tried this recipe a few times and keep coming back to it.  I've modified it but always wish that I had followed the directions.  Some modifications make it too dry.  This is one of my favorites!

Great recipe, got fab reviews at this house.  I too substituted refried beans for the pinto beans, and I also added corn to each mixture.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Will make again and again.

Good base recipe.  I thought the bean mixture a little plain; I'd probably use different fillings next time.

For being (kinda) low fat and meatless, this was pretty darn tasty. It looked nice too. I used refried beans instead of pinto, and one (15 oz) can is plenty. I sprinkled the top with extra cilantro. I will make again but I think next time I would use pepperjack cheese or maybe some sliced jalapenos or diced chilies. It needs a little extra kick.

Yummy dish!  I added onion to the pinto bean mash - it added a bit of a kick.  I also forgot to add the cilantro before baking so I sprinkled it on top after baking.  Combined with the sour cream, everything tasted great!

This was definately a filling meal, however the problem I had was that it tasted pretty bland.  Ir definately needs something else, but I have not quite put my finger on it.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  If I can come up with something else to spice it up with, I will make it again.

This was delicious!  I was a little nervous, because I'd never made it and was having company the night I finally DID make it.  But it turned out wonderfully!  So tasty, and relatively healthy, too.  I didn't use cilantro (didn't have any), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly & was very pleased.  If you like mexican-type dishes, I recommend you give this one a try!

It tasted very good and was quite filling.

I don't know what we did wrong but we followed the recipe and had way too many tortillas and filling!  We used a 9" springform pan and only needed 4 tortillas to make it to the top of the pan.

I would make it again but with about half the amount of ingredients.  It tasted great accompanied by guacamole!

This recipe was okay, except it needed a lot more flavour, so I spiced it up with mexican seasoned salt, cumin, and garlic salt.  My family is not vegetarian, so instead of using two cans of pinto beans, I used one can and added a layer of cooked ground beef, cumin, and garlicsalt.  My husband LOVED it, but my two year old wouldn't touch it.

Excellent recipe A+++!  Very easy to make and delicious to eat!  My 5 year old son is a vegetarian (by choice) and a very picky eater - he gives this pie a "two thumbs up" and says it should be famous!

Very good recipe and fun to make. Took other reviewer's suggestions and added shredded chicken (with Mexican seasonings), corn, green chilies, and used refried beans instead of mashing up pintos, and drizzled enchilada sauce over the chicken layers.  Used Monterrey Jack as the cheese. I toasted the flour tortillas way too much, next time I'm going to check on them earlier, but it was fine. My boyfriend was thinking it wasn't going to be this good and he was amazed by the results and can't wait to have it again. I used a springform pan to bake it in.

I followed some of the other reviews and used chicken, jalapeños, and tomato sauce.  I boiled some chicken quarters and added some oregano, cumin, bay leaf, garlic powder, onion powder, Goya, and crushed red pepper. 
One of the other reviewers used enchilada sauce, I took the recommendation and made by own with the canned tomato sauce, some of the chicken broth, Goya, and mixed it with the shredded chicken. 
I layered the tortillas with black beans, pepper jack cheese, sharp cheddar cheese, shredded chicken, jalapeños, salsa, a small amount of brown rice, and seasoned tomato sauce.  I had enough chicken broth to freeze and use for another recipe.  Thanks KDCG!

This was good, but I have some recipes I like better that are similar in concept, but spread out over a casserole.  I took it out at 40 minutes like the recipe states because I had some hungry (and demanding) kids, but it should have cooked about 10 more minutes.

Wow the guys went crazy over this one. Used refried black beans with a medium salsa, and then used spicy pinquito beans, added two cups of a chicken I had just roasted, and Rotel with Lime and Cilantro. I used Cilantro paste from a tube, tastes good. I also only had corn tortillas but after softening the tortillas in the oven, they worked fine. Thanks for the recipe!

This tasted pretty good, but it was a bit of a mess to serve.  I did add some enchilada sauce between the layers and on top, so part of the mess was my doing. I also had extra beans - I can only imagine how messy it would have been if I'd used it all!  I did use the springform pan and that helped contain it.  I think I'd rather just roll them into enchiladas next time.

I was worried about how this would turn out, since I was in a hurry and screwed up a few things.  I used whole wheat tortillas, a can of refried beans in place of the pintos, added some chopped bell pepper to the black beans, and was liberal with the cilantro.  I also (accidentally) left out the tomatoes and didn't bother to measure the amount of beans I was spreading in each layer, so the top black bean layer was pretty skimpy and the whole stack of tortillas was droopy around the edges.  I also used a combo of Mexican cheese blend and mozzarella.  If I'd had more time, I definitely would have added more spices and vegetables, but as it was, it was delicious and held together surprisingly well!  Will make again.

So simple and full of flavor! I did add a couple things to the recipe but otherwise I wouldn't change it at all. I added black olives and green onion and also used a Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar. My husband said it was one of the best things I have made, my 2 year old devoured it and this will be put into my cookbook. I served it with Spanish rice, sour cream and salsa.

Wow! I loved this recipe!  I must say I am surprised how delicious this is. It looked good enough to give it a try, but I didn't think it would be as good as it is! It was super easy and the whole family loved it- even my 8 year old self-proclaimed bean hater loved this and said he wants me to make it again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly (although I was generous with the cilantro since I love cilantro), and I think it has plenty of flavor and the tortillas were not at all soggy. It was perfect as is. We will definitely be adding this to our regular rotation!

Awesome version of seven layer dip! I added hamburger meat, black olives, and substituted refried beans for pinto, then topped it with shredded lettuce & sour cream when its finished baking.

Amazing dish. My husband is finicky about totilla anything and he loved it. I went to get camera to take pic after cutting 1st slice (big mistake) by the time I got back the pie was cut and everyone was eating it. OMG absolutely everyone loved it. I made a few changes, I didn't have pinto beans so I used mild flavored chili beans and mixed with 1 tbsp of burrito seasoning and 1 tbsp of Goya's Cilantro Cooking base. I used Paul Newman's Pineapple Salsa instead of regular. OMG..amazing! I topped with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa. I plan to serve this again this weekend for the game.  I also plan to submit a pic next  time because this is a beautiful layered dish and you can be quite creative with it. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I made this and my family went nuts. I did not have pinto beans, so I replaced it with ground chicken and a little ground beef. I also added just a touch more salsa and topped it with black beans, tomatoes and cilantra. It has been permanatly added as a keeper.

I used a small casserole dish and covered the bottom with totillas that I had toasted. I added taco seasoned ground beef. I used rotel instead of salsa and tomatoes.  I added some Mexican corn, too.  I used one can of refried beans and one can of black beans.  Okay, I made a lot of changes. Sorry!  But it turned out well.  I think I'll try chicken next.  Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration!

I added a layer of ground turkey seasoned with taco seasoning and mixed with canned green chillies and corn. Additionally, I toasted the tortillas first to keep them from getting mushy.  Overall, I might add a bit a more cheese and use all the bean spread next time.

Really good!  I just made this for my family/in-laws and they loved it.  They want me to make it for the next family party.  I didn't change it very much, just added some diced green chilies to the bean mixtures and put a few layers of ground taco meat.  Next time I think I'll use try using home cooked pinto beans, yum!

Followed others' advice and used refried beans.  Added garlic powder and chili powder to the mix.  Added corn to black bean mix, and used Rotel instead of tomatoes.  I ended up needing two pans, and only bake it for about 20-25 min.  It was good, but I don't know if I will makeit often, simply b/c it left me with lots of leftover Rotel, salsa, and cilantro that I am not sure I have easy ways to use up.

I really liked the concept and it was pretty easy to make. I feel like it could have used a little more oomph so I added some extra spices and used a hot salsa. Not sure if I would make it again or not. It basically tasted like a bean burrito but nicer presentation.

This came out very yummy! A little bit on the heavy side but I would make it again as a once in a while sort of dish.

WOW! This is a simple dish with TONS of flavor! I took advice from other reviews and cooked the tortillas for 5min before assembling. I doubled the cilantro and used a chipoltle cheddar then cooked in a springform pan. I added some pickled jalepenos for some heat as well as avocado. Next time I might add olives and chicken but it was superb without! I served with a chopped salad tossed with red onion, corn, pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, avocado and feta. Thank you, thank you!

With such a high rating, I expected more. I like to try a recipe out AS IS before making any modifications so I can give it a fair review. After reading through the other reviews, I noticed that other people were rating this recipe based on their results with NUMEROUS modifications.   That being said, I made 2 changes to this recipe: 1. I used tofu in place of the pinto beans (prepared as instructed. I'm positive using pinto beans would not have changed my rating) 2. I removed the foil with about 10 minutes left of cook time to crisp it up a bit.   I found this recipe to be a tad bland. I like the suggestion of mixing in a packet of taco seasoning and may try that in the future. I think more tomatoes would help add more variety to the texture (I really like tomatoes). I was expecting this to be "bubbly" and was disappointed that it was so dry. The extra salsa and sour cream were definitely needed. (I was confused by the mention of Picante sauce in the submitters comments since the recipe didn't call for any)  I had a hard time fitting all the layers in my pie pan and stopped at six. Next time I might try it in a deep casserole dish. Unlike other reviewers though, I didn't see any need to pre-bake the tortillas. Mine came out just fine with the provided instructions.

Spectacular! So good even my meat lover boyfriend enjoyed this vegetarian fare. I doubled the garlic (cuz I'm addicted) and added hot pepper sauce to taste. I ended up with only 6 layers but still could have used another 10 minutes of cook time to completely cook the middle. But overall it's YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! Enjoy.

Some bites were ok & some bites seemed dry. We will try again but maybe add a southwest sauce of some kind in between the layers. but overall, good.

Absolutely MARVELOUS! I pureed the pintos using a food processor - worked great. I ran short of salsa and didn't have black beans handy, so I used finely diced onions and green peppers from our garden with red beans and didn't need the sour cream topping. I used sprouted grain tortillas (Ezekiel brand) and had no trouble whatsoever with sogginess. I also tried using the springform pan, but we have some perfect-for-this round casserole dishes I'll use next time. Really, truly a marvel. Everyone loved it! I love the health it'll help create! Will be making this many times over...

Nice twist!  I added a few changes - ground beef with taco seasonings - great way to use left overs!  Makes a lot too - also works reheated.  I used lowfat cheese and sourcream, fat free refried beans and whole wheat tortillas and you never would have known!  Thanks...

I LOVE this recipe, but my boyfriend, who hates cilantro, won't touch it. I make it every time we have "make your own meal" night, though. It's one of the few recipes that I don't alter at all—it's perfect as is.

This recipe was alright, but we felt it was too much bean for our appetite. We usually prefer vegetarian meals but felt this would benefit from some seasoned chicken or something else.

Very good!  I used refried beans (in place of pinto beans) and added a half packet of taco seasoning in addition to a half pound of ground beef.  I also threw in some olives and corn and briefly baked the tortillas before using them.  My husband gave this recipe a definite five!

Make this easier on yourself and use refried beans instead of mashing up pinto beans.  Also, I added black bean and corn salsa which was a nice addition.  This is one of those recipes that you can throw in whatever else you would like and it will still turn out great (peppers, onions, avocado, etc). Fantastic!

This was amazing!  So simple and very filling.  I did 2 cans of refried beans instead of the pinto beans and added a can of corn with the black beans.  I think it added something different than just layers of beans.  Served it with torn lettuce, sour cream, salsa, olives and for a little extra crunch, some lightly crushed tortilla chips!  Wonderful!!

This smelled really good while it was cooking, but it didn't present well on the plates (probably due to the fact that the tortillas got rather soggy).  My 3-year-old just looked at it and kept asking what it was.  After my husband and I stopped laughing, we all went out for dinner.

The flavor was great, but my bottom layer of tortillas were a bit soggy.  I had even precooked them as others had suggested.  It may have been my fault, as I added rotel instead of the tomatoes and also substituted the black beans for chili beans and the pinto beans for refried black beans.  Actually, I only used one can of the chili beans.  Also I added fresh sweet minced onion on top of each refried bean layer (what should have been the pinto beans)before adding cheese.  On top of each chili bean layer (what should have been the black bean layer) I addded enchilada sauce, and also on top of the whole thing.  That may have been the cause for my sogginess, I just didn't want it to be too dry.  However, when I reheated them the next day in the toaster oven, it seemed to clear up the sogginess.  They reheat really well as long as you have already pre-cut the pieces.  Very pretty!!!

Easy and filling. I used corn tortillas, a can of refried beans instead of pintos and only 1 can was necessary, an american/cheddar cheese blend, and didn't have chopped tomato. My husband thought it was too soggy. He would have preferred a crispy tortilla to the soft ones. This was okay, but I didn't care for the cilantro flavor. My teen ate two pieces he liked this so well. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband made this and made a few changes, first, he made it casserole style in a 9x13 baking dish.  He still layered everything but used bigger tortillas (burrito sized).  He added a layer of chicken taco meat using the Salsa Chicken Burrito Filling recipe.  I think he added a thin layer of cream cheese and a little more cheese.  It was delicious.

The family loved this, especially my super picky 3 year old. I used whole wheat tortillas. I mixed the pinto beans with very little salsa, because my son thought it was too spicy. I mixed the black beans with roasted corn from Trader Joe's. It has a mexican kick to it, and was perfect. I also added some cumin, and left out the cilantro and salsa. When I layered the pintos I added enchilada sauce from trader Joe's (the best!) to cover the tortilla, then a layer of chopped black olives and the cheese, then a tortilla and the black bean/corn mixture. I repeated and added enchilada sauce every time with the pintos.  I poured more enchilada sauce over the top to cover all visible tortillas. I used shredded 3 cheese blend. It was so good! I've never seen my son eat more of anything, and he had leftovers the next day.

Real yummy.  I only used 4 very large, homemade burritos for layering.  I used a kidney bean mix instead of black beans (from the Addictive Sweet Potato Burrito recipe).

I made this last night and even my very carnivorous boyfriend loved it! I followed some of the tips here and really spiced it up. I agree that baking the tortillas for 5 mins first kept them crispy as opposed to soggy. I used 1-1/2 cans of fat free refried pinto beans instead of mashed whole beans, and I added lots of chile powder and "Mexican Spices" (pre-mixed spice bottle) to the mixture. For the black bean mix, I added a small can of green chiles, some chile powder, and substitued red bell pepper for the tomatoes. I also added sliced jalepenos to the top of each pinto bean layer. To keep it healthier I omitted the sour cram and used reduced fat mexican-blend cheese. The prep took some time but it was definitely yummy!

This was quite good.. I added chicken to the layer with the tomatoes and cilantro and beans which I thought made this recipe a 5 star, but it wasn't written in which makes it a 4 without the chicken.  Enjoy!

I really liked this and swear I followed the recipe exactly and only ended up with 6 layers go figure.  I left out the cilantro but would definitely not leave out the garlic.  The garlic gave it most of its flavor.  I had planned on adding green chilies but forgot.  I would recommend serving topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and maybe a few olives.

This was very good, but a little tangier than I'd expected. I'd add some spinach for the value of having a green veggie (or, more veggies period, instead of just being mostly beans and cheese).

This was pretty good and pretty easy. The only change I made was to add some diced red pepper to the black bean mixture. I thing I will probably make this again.

This was really good - my 5 year old and husband loved it.  I made a few changes - I replaced one layer of cheddar with Monteray Jack w/jalapenos and I added cumin,a can of green chiles, garlic and mexicorn to the black bean layer. I think I'll try the refried beans next time but the mashed pintos were great too.  It was even better the next day!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have 6 children. Everyone in my home loved this dinner. 

I did make a few changes to suit my family's specific tastes. I added some cumin and some chili powder. I also slightly blended the kidney bean mixture with my VitaMix. And I did not bake it covered in foil. This made it work so well for my family. They loved the crunchy edges. 

And I didn't keep track of how many layers I had. I just spread the appropriate amount of filling on each layer, sprinkled with cheese and stopped making more layers when I ran out of filling.

I have now made this several times and it just hasn't turned out "that great". I was disappointed since all of the reviews have been so high. I even tried it again recently and took it to a friends along with a few other highly rated recipes from here and out of all of them this one was the one thing that wasn't raved about. It wasn't that people didn't like it, it's just when there were other things to pick from this just didn't stack up. I am finally throwing in the towel and moving on to other new recipes to try. I love good vegetarian mexican food and I just don't think this fits the bill. It's just okay.

Yum, thanks for this recipe! I took reviewers suggestions and added green chilies, corn and red onion. After one bite my stepson said, "you made two of these, right?" Inexpensive, filling and really, really yummy.

great idea!  I have made this once for dinner and added chicken to some of the layers but next time I will keep it strictly vegetarian and only use beans.  I used black beans and vegetarian refried beans (intead of mashing my own).  I also used a really chunky pico de gallo place of the tomatoes.  I served it with guacamole and sour cream.

Thank you for this great recipe!  I'm giving this recipe five stars because it's easy, meatless, inexpensive, and tasty.  Also, my husband loved it.  Since it's so easily adaptable, I was able to make it my own:

Mixed together 2 cans fat-free refried beans, 1/2 jar of hot salsa, minced garlic (I buy minced garlic in a jar, saves so much time), red pepper (like it hot), and cumin.  Only using 1 bean mixture obviously made it much easier for a mid-week meal.

I used sun dried tomato wraps because they're low fat and there's so much flavor going on by the end of the dish that you can't even tell what kind of wraps they are.  I made seven layers.  The tortillas were soft in the middle and crispy on the edges after cooking.  On the top layer, I only used a wrap and cheese (no beans) to make it prettier :)

I topped each serving with chalula sauce, fat-free sour cream, chopped tomatoes, and chopped black olives.

This tasted like it was fattening, but wasn't.  Wonderful!

This is a tasty and incredibly quick and easy recipe to make. It was especially tasty because we added avocados and low fat sour cream upon serving. Since the fat-free tortillas I use are about 9-inches in diameter, there were only enough beans for five layers. I omitted the cilantro because we didn't have it on hand and I didn't think my bf would it (even though I love it). I didn't mash the beans until smooth because I thought a rough-mash texture would hold up the layers better. When slicing the pie, the layers held their shape, making for a nice presentation. This recipe is a real success for me because I got my bf to try black beans and now he asks for this dish all of the time!

Not impressed... just okay.  I can think of better ways to use the ingredients but, as a native New Mexican, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to mexican food. :)

Mmmmmmmmm....I love this recipe! I've made it a couple times, and the first time I put each of the ingredients on a different layer...it was still delicious! I use refried beans to make it easier (less mashing) & I also add green peppers to the black bean mixture. Great recipe!

I don't like rating a recipe below a 4, but I think this needs alot of work to be good. We just didn't care for it, but the concept is good. I think this had too many layers but that's an easy fix. I was dissappointed because the ratings are usually on target, but this just didn't live up to them, IMHO.

VERY good and very forgiving recipe. I made the following alterations: added fiesta corn to the black bean mixture and added green chilies to both bean mixes. I also added extra cilantro, cumin and paprika because other reviewers mentioned the recipe was a bit bland. It still was..next time I'll add more. Defineately serve this dish with sour cream and guacamole. I used the "best guacamole" recipe found on this site and it was perfect!

This was really simple to make and tasted great. We prefer to let the dish sit, assembled, over night in order to combine the flavors. It was very filling as well! A great dish for potlucks or get togethers.

WOW!! With a dollop of sour cream this was so good! Truth be told when I was making the pie, it didn't really look like something I wanted to eat, but once it was done and I added my SC and salsa to it... YUM!! My husband added a little Tabasco to his to give it that extra kick while my daughter and I enjoyed the 'less spicy version' ;)

This was simple to make and flavor was good.  I did tweak it a little.  Will probably tweak a little more, but it's a very versatile recipe.  You could pretty much add whatever you like (black olives, chicken, ground beef, avocado) and it would still be good.  Definitely an easy meal to throw together and the kids loved it.

I thought this was great. It was really simple. I added a layer of ground turkey b/c the boyfriend requested "something with meat". I also made fresh guacamole to serve along side. This was especially good reheated for lunch the next day.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit. I used a 2 1/2 qt casserole dish, and added a layer of sliced avocados. The tortillas were soggy but I will make it again with whole wheat or maybe try some of the flavored tortillas. Thanks!!

This was a delicious dish, but I found the tortillas were really soggy, which for me took a little bit away from the entire dish. Sometimes it really is about texture. I'm going to try this recipe with corn tortillas and see if it is better.

Great addition for our "Cinco de Mayo" dinner!  The tortillas didn't get that "soggy, gooey" texture like some do when baked.  It was a hit.  Hubby was upset there wasn't any leftovers that he could take to lunch on Monday!  It made plenty, though!  Thanks!

My family loved this. I changed it up a bit. I used a small can of refried beans, sm. can of pinto beans, and a small can of black beans. I bought a small can of enchilada sauce and poured a little bit on the bottom of a baking dish then I put a tortilla down then the refried bean/pinto beans/garlic/salsa(used a medium Pace salsa)mixture down. Next I added some shredded cheese and another tortilla and some enchilada sauce. Then I added my chopped tomato(used 4 romas)/cilantro(fresh is the only way to go)/corn/salsa/black bean mixture. Then another tortilla and more enchilada sauce. I repeated the layers ending with bean mixture and cheese on top. Garnishing with sour cream and more salsa. After making this my husband ate it with some broken tostada pieces. He used the dinner as almost a dip. Since the tortillas do get soggy I think next time I will use tostadas between the mixtures instead of flour tortillas.

Excellent recipe-I used the refried beans in place of the pinto beans and used taco cheese instead of the cheddar.
My daughter said "can we have this every night for dinner"!!

I made this in 5 layers in a springform pan, 7 layers would not fit. This recipe needs more flavor...it was missing something, maybe some cumin like others suggested.

good recipe, but try rotel tomatoes with chiles and spinach or other flavored tortillas for extra yum.

Great meal!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I used refried beans and only  5 layers.  Also cut some corn off the cob and added it into the black bean mixture.  I will make this one again!

As with any recipe, I added my own touches. Used refried beans, added fiesta corn, used chipotle smoked diced tomatoes in place of salsa. My meat eatter hubby raved about it! This will be a repeat in my veggie household. :)

i made this with 5 tortillas not 7...i couldnt jam anything else in the pan..i did use large tortillas though...
substituted the 2 cans each of black and pinto beans as well as a can of refried beans for the two different layers
served with homemade guacomole and light sour cream tasted really great..
could use some more variety in the pie..more texture or taste maybe
perhaps corn or some chopped veggies....like more tomatoes perhaps peppers ..
made ALOT of food..enough for 10 people i would think....
would add cumin to the two cans of bean/salsa mix for more taste...
also would end it with a tortilla then cheese..not a layer of beans then cheese as stated....
make alot of guacomole with this recipe..its going to be needed..
the taste is somewhat bland...
but it beats a boring chicken breast, potatoe, carrot meal anyday!

This was excellent.  So rich and filling.  I used Romano beans instead of Pintos, because that is what I had on hand.  This also makes great leftovers, and freezes very well!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was a big hit with my husband and the kids liked it too.  I was out of black beans so used white kidney instead and it still worked.  The 40 minute cooking time didn't heat it through but that was probably because it was in the fridge for a few hours first.  Next time I will throw in some cooked chicken for my family of meat eaters.

I found this one in my Allrecipes cookbook and it was pretty good: I added about a half teaspoon of cumin and a few shakes of chili powder to the black bean mixture to spice it up a bit. I don't think that 7 layers is necessary: I will probably do 5 layers next time to cut down on carbs and really let the beans and other flavors shine rather than be obscured by all the tortilla dough. The cilantro didn't do it for me in this recipe, either. Otherwise, good dish--definitely worth a second try.

Really great meatless dish.  Followed reciped pretty close except I had no fresh cilantro (darn!) and I added more garlic and salsa.  Seemed to need a little salt and even more spice for next time, but we still enjoyed it a lot.  Son had 3 helpings and then took what few leftovers were there for his lunch!

Not bad, but like a few others said, a little bland. For the first time I made it I followed the recipe to a tee. I might try it again with hotter salsa or some green chilis. I also think I over cooked it a bit. It was a little dry.

Good and very filling but seemed to be lacking something.  Kind of bland.  We all agreed we like my regular taco pie recipe instead and probably won't bother making this one again.  I'd say the prep time is closer to 1/2 hr.

Quite good, and very easy to make for a quick, filling meal. It isn't extremely flavorful, but I wouldn't say it was bland. The fresh cilantro really does it, and would be rather dull without it. For an even quicker version, I'd use refried beans instead of mashed pinto beans, which would probably be just as good, perhaps better. Makes a great meal with some rice and corn.

Very easy, very quick to make. I didn't have cilantro but was it still very tasty! My husband LOVED it. Very inexpensive to make. I got all of the ingredients (except the cilantro) at a local food store called Save A Lot and I think my total came to $3 and some change. Not bad for a family on a budget.

This is really good, although I could only manage 5 layers, not seven. With some cumin in the pintos, and extra cilantro with lime juice in the black beans, it was even better. Easily made with typical vegetarian pantry items. Nice!

Boy was this delicious and just perfect for my Superbowl party!  Eventhough it was very easy to prepare, the presentation was quite impressive.  The only thing I would change would be to add more cilantro the next time, but that is probably just a matter of taste.  Kudos!

Lots of protein!  I love the combo of beans and salsa in this; my fiancee and guests last night couldn't seem to get enough.

I served this to a group of my friends and they all loved it. One friend, who works at a neighborhood co-op deli, said that her deli serves a similar dish only it is so loaded with veggies that it tastes like every other veggie dish. The genius of this pie, she said, is that it is simple and basic and good. I trust her. I'll make it again, no doubt.

great recipe.  Add a little extra cilantro for more zest to the flavor. May try adding olives to the top as well.

My husband REALLY loved this and  has asked me to make it every week for the past couple of weeks.  He is picky--especially about foods that are remotely healthy--so this is a very good find for me.

In one word.... this recipe is AWESOME!!! My husband, who's not vegetarian, even loved this! My twelve year old son loved it too (although, my two wee ones didn't care much for it). Overall, it's a fabulous dish!

It was a tasty vegetarian meal, served with a side salad.  I added frozen corn kernels, cumin, taco seasoning, kosher salt and a small tin of chopped green chilis to add more flavouring.  Unfortunately, the tortillas were all soggy which was unappetizing.   The kids ate it all up though which was encouraging! I'm not sure I would add 2 cans pinto beans next time, I think 1 can would suffice.

Yum yum yum this is good, but made even better (in my family’s humble opinion) with the addition of a layer of mashed sweet potato and pan fried mushrooms.

Spray the foil with oil to prevent sticking.  Cook about 10 minutes longer to get it really hot all the way through.  It is definitely a keeper!

Way too much pinto beans.  I did use whole wheat tortillas for nutritional value. I used more cheese than it called for and was still ruunny. Last but not least, it was tall and your top layer is cheese which  you cover with foil? Cheese sticks to foil. I definitely agree with a reviewer that suggested using a Spring form pan.

I made this quite some time ago after printing off the recipe, wrote notes, circled four stars but never wrote a review.  I noted that it was easy and good; used 1/2 tsp. powdered garlic as had no garlic cloves; didn't have cilantro (fresh or dried); had mistakenly bought refried black beans; used 1/2 c. canned diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano; 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese.  There was black bean mix left after putting the last tortilla on so added that along with the pinto beans on top.  Would make this again.

We really liked this one and it was nice to have something different. I only had dried beans so had to plan ahead and soak and cook them. I used half the amount of pinto beans called for  and added a pound of ground beef sautéed with chili powder, salt, cumin, oregano and cayenne. I also found the black bean mixture bland so added salt to taste and about a 1/4 cup more of salsa. I omitted the cilantro due to the fact that DH hates it but it would have gone well in my opinion. Great recipe that is very versatile based on what you have!

My changes were, I baked the tortillas some, used 1 can of refried beans in place of one of the cans of pinto beans, added fresh diced jalapenos, a can of diced green chilis drained, used mexican blend cheese, also added black olives to each layer and topped it with enchilada sauce. It turned out great!

You definitely have to add the salsa and sour cream at the end. Or taco sauce. It was a little bland. I used wheat tortillas but that was my only change. I didn't find it to be runny at all. I added green chilies and corn, maybe next time two cans of chilies.

added onions of course.. but this is definitely turned my opinion around.. I was going into it thinking it wouldn't be enough but it sure as heck was!!  Super delicious especially with the added onions and extra cilantro I put in it.. threw some hot sauce in there as well and mixed it all in together.. came out SUPER delicious!! Recipe is definitely a keeper to make over and over again!!

No need to add to the recipe.   My family thinks that this is their favourite dish now.  It was easy to make and quick to prepare.  I served it with salsa, sour cream and guacamole.   There are five in my family and next time I will have to double the dish to have left overs for school.

The only change I made was to use corn tortillas (because I have celiac).  It was ridiculously easy to make, we loved it, and I will certainly make it again.   Thank you for the recipe.

I made it once with flour tortillas and once with corn tortillas  for my gluten-free friend. I enjoyed them both. I added a little more cheese the second time around and made sure to have enough sour cream and picante sauce to put on top. You can definitely add whatever you'd like to mix in but it was good as presented.

Needs some shredded chicken mixed in with the smashed beans or layered before the cheese.  Some added seasoning, some taco mix perhaps, would be a good addition.

I added a ground beef mixture, used refried beans, and followed the directions.  I placed the beef in two layers. It was fairly tall when finished but the end result was everyone loved it. And it really did slice like a pie. This will be repeat in our house. Give it a try.

My family, who complains about nearly everything, loved it.  We added hamburger to it.  I would recommend some more spices, like Cajun or chili powder, if you like tangy food.  Although I found it blandish, I truly enjoyed it myself.

I made this for company last night. It was delicious. After reading many of the other reviews I incorporated the most frequent suggestions (fewer layers, refried beans, adding ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning, making it in a spring form pan). I ended up with 4 layers only (2 each of the bean tomato layer and the ground beef, onion, olive, layer with cheese on each) ending with beef and then cheese. Baked covered for 40 minutes and then uncovered for 10-15 minutes. It was a big hit. I'll make it again.

This turned out super yummy!  I was worried it would be sloppy, but it kept its shape pretty well when I sliced it.

Great basic recipe.  I used Ro Tel instead of shopped fresh tomatoes, and I used a can of refried black beans instead of plain black beans. I will be making this again. I am really trying to find meatless recipes that my husband likes, and this one fit the bill.

This was a fantastic recipe!!  I tweaked it a little by using a square pan, cutting corn tortillas in half to layer them instead of flour (we prefer corn), I also bought a rotisserie chicken, which I shredded to add on the layers and used Mexican cheese instead of cheddar (it's what I had on hand).  With each bean mixture layer, I added the chicken, then cheese and did everything else per directions.  After removing the foil, I let the top cheese brown a little for texture (added an extra 10 minutes to baking time). My family loved it and made me promise to do it again soon!!!

Wished I had followed the advice of others and toasted the tortillas because they did get mushy. I substituted 1/8 tsp of garlic powder for the garlic since I'm not a big garlic fan and needed to shorten the prep time. Did not have cilantro; thus didn't use it. I used a can of diced tomatoes and peppers; next time I will drain it . For the cheese, I used a sharp cheddar and Monterey pepper jack combo. The pepper jack gave it a spicy kick. As a result, the sour cream side was definitely needed for my littler ones. My family enjoyed it-even my 8 year old who, when seeing the unbaked tower of tortillas, asked if I would make her something else, asked for seconds. Yummy, but mushy and liquidy.

I make this meal quite frequently using my own recipe, but wanted to answer JOYCE about using corn tortillas instead of flour for gluten free.  Yes, Joyce!  In fact I use organic corn tortillas instead of flour.  Sometimes I add organic ground turkey Always use chopped green onions, a fresh chopped up jalapeno without the seeds, cilantro, cumin and garlic.

As written I have to give this 2 stars. I have made this many times but always add cumin, oregano, minced Serrano peppers and double the garlic, otherwise it's just to bland for our tastes. I like to make this a complete meal so I usually add a pound plus of 85/15 ground beef. I never really measure cheese but I know I probably use close to 3 cups, we're cheese lovers in our house.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. 
It can be challenging to find vegetarian recipes that aren't too 'fussy', and this is a good one. 
Simple on a weeknight, satisfying, and impressive-looking. 

I have made the recipe as-is and have made it with a refried bean substitution. Either is great. I agree with some reviewers that it isn't the most flavorful recipe in the world, but I dress mine up with a flavorful pico or salsa and a bit of sour cream, and it makes a good family weeknight meal.

Used regular refried and plain black beans. Ran the black beans through the food processor. Added taco seasoning, corn, green chiles, mozzarella (would prob prefer a Mexican or cheddar jack) and stewed diced tomatoes. Layered every other one in the spring form (great suggestion). Served with avocado, sour cream and Cholula. ??

Will probably add a layer of red and yellow peppers next time. Yummm

I spiced it up with taco seasoning and hot salsa, reduced the calories with low fat mexican cheese and low fat sour cream and cut the carbs with low carb tortillas.  Now it is South Beach and WW friendly.

a good base but the beans are still a  bland so I added diced jalepenos to it.That wasnt enough so I used another posters idea and sprinkled the layers with taco seasoning. That helped a lot more...gave it depth of ot just heat. The 7 layers are awkward to build/topples easily when cut so I cut it down to 4 or 5 layers/is a more manageable size. And since I had leftover steak from the grill last night I diced it up and tossed that in there too. Added diced green onions to the sour cream on top.n In the end this was a keeper and will come back to the table...but with a lot of changes so the original version only gets a 3 on the bland scale

excellent! I have made a layered burrito-type pie many times with just a play it by ear recipe, but this one was far and away better than anything I've tried! Wonderful flavor and very filling, I was worried it wouldn't be enough to feed 5 hungry people but we had quite a lot left over. Only change I made was I used red kidney beans instead of pinto because that's what I had, and I mixed some hot pepper cheddar cheese in with the regular cheddar. YUM!

This is the only recipe I've gotten online that I was blown away by.  Everyone loves it!  I heat the tortillas over an open flame for about 10 seconds per side before I assemble the pie.  It doesn't get soggy that way.  I substitute refried beans for the pintos (1 can traditional and 1 can ranchero) and 1 can of Rotel (original) for the tomatoes.  Try it!

I found it very dry - and that was with the inclusion of enchilada sauce on top.  Still pondering a revised version - That being said - I love the concept and the flavor is good.  Thanks

I made this this weekend for the football game and everybody loved it!!! I did not layer up to 7 tortillas. Stopped at 4. I prebaked the bottom tortilla. GREAT IDEA!!! I used refried black and pinto beans and I added a little bit of ground beef that I had leftover from Nachos. Only thing is I used shredded Mexican Cheese but I think next time I will use the cheddar for more a bite as well as some Guacamole on top!

This was a pretty quick make and the taste was awesome!  I used chipotle salsa for added flavor and it was amazing!  Served with extra chopped tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole made for a beautiful presentation.

Very yummi! I just used black beans, I also added jalapenos, sweet corn and the only cheese I had at hand - gouda cheese mature. It was very very good!

I followed the recipe more or less as written; however, I added more garlic (always more garlic!), cumin, and some fresh ground pepper to the bean mixture. It came out perfectly, and with plenty of leftovers ;-) !

I cannot say how many times I've made this. It's always a hit. Rather than seven layers, I tend to make 2 5 layer pies, because one of those layers will be filled with either corn or meat.

Amazing dish -- and easy.  The whole family loved it.  I baked it in a 9" spring pan and it turned out looking like a gourmet dish served at a restaurant.  Tasted even better on day 2.

I think next time I will just use fat free refried beans instead of mashing the pintos. It was good, but kind of a PITA.   I added some fresh garlic to the pintos and I highly recommend the addition.  A very pretty presentation and tasted even better as leftovers!

Loved this!  Made it for my husband and his exceptionally picky son and both thought it was fantastic - I agree!  My version was made with a layer of refried beans, tossed some green chili's into the mix.. as others have said it's a great recipe and works with whatever you have on hand when the craving for a little tex-mex strikes!

this was easy and really tasty.  I used a fairly spicy salsa and that added lots of flavor, as well as whole wheat tortillas and monterey jack cheese rather than cheddar b/c it was all I had at the time.  I think next time I'll add some chopped green pepper and onion and saute it in some olive oil and put that in with the black beans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an interesting recipe. If you like beans, you will probably like this a lot. The texture is soggy like others commented, but it didn't bother us.  It seemed like it was supposed to be that way, kind of like a lasagna. I cut the recipe in half and just skipped the repeat of the layering. It still made enough for dinner for the two of us plus leftovers for lunch. I'd make this again.

I used this recipe as a "base" tonight for my Mexican Pie and it was awesome!  I didn't have pinto beans so I subbed black bean dip.  I added ground beef w taco seasonings, a can of corn and chopped green chilies to the tomato mixture as well.  The pie came out great and my 7 year old ate his entire portion, without complaint.  Will definately make this one again!

Amazing.  I switched out the tomatoes/salsa/cilantro for some of the "fresh salsa" I found at the grocery store near the produce section.  I sauteed tofu with the same salsa just to bring everything together.  As per the other reviewers, I used a can of refried beans instead of the pintos, and baked the bottom two tortillas for a little bit before stacking. I added a little  bit of tofu to each layer and it turned out to be amazing.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian (and I love protein) so this was an excellent dish for both of us.

Surprisingly good!  I put my tortillas in the oven for a couple minutes to prevent get them a little crispy (as another reviewer suggested).   I didn't have cilantro.  I used one can of refried beans (instead of pinto beans) and I cooked some ground beef with half an envelope of taco seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder and chipotle chili powder.  I sprinkled some black olives on top.  Mine only had 4 layers so I made the other 3 layers in another dish, and put it in the freezer for later...I've never frozen a meal before so I hope it holds up well!

Loved it!  This recipe and site inspired me to get back into cooking - (I've had springform pans for Years and never used them before - who knew?!) I added in black olives and used no-fat refried beans and since it was a wider pan - the bigger tortillas.  Everything was low fat or no fat and I washed the black beans etc to remove as much sodium as possible.  I served it with guacamole - YUM!

Awesome recipe!  As the other reviwers suggested, I used enchilada sauce on every other layer (the black bean layers), and sliced black olives on the pinto bean layers.  Came out amazing!!!

It was good, I'll probably make it again, but it needed something.  Maybe some corn? I'm not sure, but it is a good base to start with, I'll have fun figuring out different ways to personalize it.

This has become a staple in my house. I have modified it to better suite our tastes by omiting the pinto beans and adding red, yellow and green peppers and corn. Thank you so much for this family favorite!!!

Excellent with a few changes as noted by other reviewers.  I added frozen corn, taco seasoning, and a can of green chilies.

Delicious! I added corn, orange pepper, and chili powder. I also used kidney beans instead of pinto beans. Everyone loved it and it was even good the next day for lunch!

This is one of my fave meals now...It's so yummy!!! Just made it tonight, almost the exact same as the recipe. I used whole wheat tortillas, added a dash of chili powder to both bean mixtures, and used Mexican cheese.  I did throw the tortillas in the oven for about 3 minutes before which worked well. Will make this again for sure!

This is a pretty good vegetarian main dish. If I make it again I will add black sliced olives to the top layer before baking, then another sprinkling of diced tomatoes and some sliced green onions on the top after it comes out of the oven.

This is really good! I made a few modifications and used refried beans, like a few other reviewers said. It's much easier. I also added serrano pepper to make it spicier. :)

Should rename this "BEAN PIE."  I used refried beans (not pinto), 1 can Rotel (not chopped tomatoes), and whole wheat tortillas.  My husband did not think this was real food.  He ate it anyway, nice man that he is.  Probably won't attempt again.

My boyfriend and I wanted to eat in one night and found this dish.  We didn't have a round pie plate so we used a cake dish instead.  I used two tortillas cut in half to cover each layer, putting the cut edges along the edge of the pan and overlapping the round edges in the center.  We also skipped the garlic, but put veggie chorizo in with both of the bean mixtures.  We also swapped the pinto beans with refried beans.  I wish I had made more of the bean mixtures because while using a bigger pan, there wasn't quite enough to cover each layer.  So there was more tortilla on the ends, which worked fine to dip in the extra salsa. We also served it with some sour cream and fresh avocado slices.

I have made this many times and my husband and I love it! I use dried kidney and black beans and soak and cook them myself. I also add corn, chopped black olives, green onion and chopped jalepenos from a jar to the black bean mixture. I serve it with guacamole and salsa, which we prefer to sour cream. Delicious!

Yummy, easy to make and even better the next day. I used refried beans, and layered it all in a spring form pan. Next time I am going to cook it a little longer because I found the cheese did not melt fully in the center.

This is soooo goood! Thank you so much for this recipe. We just had it for supper. My daughter's girlfriend, who ate with us, never had anything like that, she immediatelly asked for the recipe, so she could show her mom. Since I couldn't get pinto beans where I live, I just used Kidney beans and white beans, mixed and mashed them together with the salsa for one layer. I also added hamburger with Taco seasoning for another layer, mixed with sliced red peppers, the tomatoes and corn. Also, as suggested by another reviewer, added sliced avocado on top. There are endless possibilites to this recipe. Next time, I'll just make the tortillas myself, since the ones I can buy here in Germany are very small. Thanks again for a wonderful basic. Will be a regular in our home.

We love this recipe!  It's easy to prepare ahead of time and refrigerate - there is no loss of quality.  You must bake a little longer (closer to an hour).  I usually add some cumin and cayenne to the pinto mixture and diced onions and black olives to the black bean mixture.  It's great just as written, though!

Easy & fast. Added more to the recipe, ground turkey, black olives and avacado. A little dry, maybe I need more salsa? Good otherwise.

super yummy! I added some corn and olives as suggested and it was a good compliment to this dish. Also added some red enchilada sauce to a couple of the layers, but not all of them. Some sliced avocado on top and sour cream on on the side. this was a big hit with the boyfriend especially so we will be making this again!

I liked this a lot and my partner loved it. I made two small changes. One, I first used another recipe to turn the pinto beans into seasoned refried beans. Two, I chopped a panfried chicken breast into pieces and added it to the layers as well. I'm also a liberal garlic/cilantro user, so I might have used more than the recipe called for. I've bookmarked the recipe to make again.

Really good!  I added chicken, onions, corn, green chiles and I used the pinto beans that had jalapenos in them for added favor.  I did not cover it w/ foil and only baked it for about 20 min.  The top came out crusty & bubbly- yum!

The tortillas were extremely soggy even though I baked them ahead of time for a few minutes as suggested by other reviewers...if not for that I think it would've been pretty good.  It was kind of gross with the sogginess, though. My husband thought it was bean overload.  I also didn't think it was all that quick even though every one else seems to think so, so maybe that's just me!

I baked this last night for an office lunch, and even after re-heating in the microwave, everyone loved it.  A few co-workers even went back for seconds.

Very easy to make and tastes great!!

Really good and very satisfying. I used fajita sized tortillas and layered them into a cake pan, which kept everything neat and contained. I also used salsa instead of tomatoes, because I didn't have any, and that worked very well. Yummy!

Nice change from regular tacos! The only bummer for me was that we had no canned pinto beans-only dry, so I had to cook them for what seemed like forever. I also added ground turkey with half a taco seasoning and added the other half to the pintos (which I mashed in the food processor). I toasted mine over the burners quickly to prevent sogginess. I think if you are trying to be healthier, you could probably do without the full 2 cups of cheese. Used a spring form pan also because it was as tall as I had. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Great basic recipe inspiration. Gave me good guidelines to create my own version which added more spices & a layer of chicken. Only had standard cake pan on hand but found 4-5 layers to be plenty!

This came out perfect and looked just like the picture. I thought it lacked flavor other than just beans. I probably won't make again.

I really liked this recipe, I love beans so it was perfect for me.  I used refried beans (with lime and green chiles) instead of pinto beans and it was very good, but I would like to try next time with the pinto beans.

I also made fresh guacamole and put that on top and guacamole is great on anything mexican so that was delicious! 

My husband enjoyed this too.

This is a great recipe.  I added 1/2 lb beef to one of the layers of pinto beans, used canned tomatoes in the black bean mixture and mashed some cooked pinto beans that were leftover from having beans and rice instead of canned refried beans.  I thought this was almost better the next day when everything had melded together more.

i loved this. i took some suggestions that i found in the reviews: i added 1/2 pack taco seasoning to the pinto bean mixture and some cumin to the black bean mixture. i used a jack and cheddar cheese mix instead of just cheddar. it came out perfectly, not too dry or too soggy. i'll definitely be making it again.

This recipe is great!  I've made this several times and each time you can do something a little different.  My husband likes taco meat added to his.  I'm a vegetarian so I like fake taco meat or soyrizo, and any vegetable(s) I have in the house.  Try pouring a can of your favorite enchilada sauce over the top before baking, yum!

This was sooo good! I used one can pinto beans, one can refried beans, and one can of black beans, which i think was perfect.  The only other changes i made were to add a small can of black olives and I used Rotel for the chopped tomatoes. I just ate it leftover for lunch and I think it may be even better the next day! Thank you so much!!

Very simple to make.  Next time I think I'll use refried beans instead of pinto, and add a can of Rotel instead of chopped tomatoes to give it a little more kick.

This was pretty good, although as my bf put it, "it's mighty beany."  Would like to try it again with shredded chicken as others have suggested.  I kinda wished the tortillas would crisp up a little instead of getting as soggy as they did, maybe next time I will bake without the foil for a few minutes?  In general very good easy recipe.

I was surprised at how wonderful this dish turned out to be! I made it exactly following the recipe.  It turned out so great! My 3 year old son called it a pizza and my husband is requesting a repeat.  I served this with some diced (fresh) tomato and avacado.

So much better than you'd expect from such simple ingredients.  The only changes I made was using coriander and garlic powder in place of the cilantro and garlic.  Next time, when I have these ingredients, I will use them.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is a versatile recipe that can be easily added to/subtracted from.  It is delicious, and very quick and easy to make.  I didn't have much time, so I only baked it for 20 minutes, and it was really good!  We'll be making this one again.

Would give it 4 1/2 stars.  I liked it quite a bit while my boyfriend LOVED it.  I used refried beans instead of messing with regular pintos.  As I was putting the tower together, I really was scared it would come tumbling down in transport or while cooking, but it didn't, the mushy beans held it all together!  Seemed to me like something was missing... perhaps that would be the sour cream that I didn't have on the side.  Regardless, it was tasty and I'll make it again.

Five stars because everyone loves it in the house and its fairly easy to make.  Fun for kids to put together.  We always add stuff like olives, avocados, whatever we have.  Also, last time I only used one can of pintos, and it was fine.

This was really good and most importantly really cheap to make. The prep time is a little more then 15 minutes I think, and it could use a little less cilantro ( my boyfriend didn't like it because he said there was too much cilantro for his taste, hence the 4 star rating) but overall this was a good recipe and after some tweeks I will definently make this again

I like my grandmothers version of it better. It's made with ground beef and refried beans. Hers is more like a seven layer bean dip tortilla pie. This one was okay but left me wanting ol' grandma's recipe.

Like other reviewers, I did a bit of tweaking to fit my tastes and it turned out great!  Added a couple layers of ground beef sautéed with onion and taco seasoning.  Also added about half a chopped onion in with the black bean mixture.  Used dried cilantro instead of fresh and colby jack instead of cheddar because that's what I had on hand.  Only four stars because it still needs a little more flavor: I'll try adding green chiles next time as others suggested.

Very tasty! Subbed in refried beans for the pinto beans. Also covered with foil for part of the baking time as the top started to get a little dry.

Thank you.  This was an excellent meatless meal.  Both my husband and my brother also loved it.  I used 2% Mexican cheese blend and it melted well. It's a great (and healthier) alternative to going out for Mexican food.

I really liked this. I used not only mashed pinto beans, but also mashed black beans.  It was pretty tall, but it didn't fall apart like I expected it to.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I'll make it again sometime!

It is probably unfair for me to be rating this dish now, as I made it almost 6 months ago.... it was quite good, and I didn't have a problem getting my partner to eat the entire dish in a couple of sittings. But it was quite messy, was a bit of a hassle to make and didn't really live up to my expectations (or the rave reviews it was getting here). I will keep it in my recipe box, and try again one day, because it was good- just not terrific. I also tend to like dishes that are as visually appealing as they are delicious, and this one certainly wasn't very pretty. Still, the flavor was good.
Not bad.

I made this  last night, it was good but I felt like it needed something.  I will make it again and experiment with maybe adding shredded chicken, sliced olives and avocado.  On the upside, it was easy and very inexpensive.

Great recipe! It's very forgiving with adding and changing  ingredients-- like adding different types of beans, omitting tomatoes, etc. We will definitely make this again.

Really great recipe that my husband and I enjoyed very much.  I didn't have the tomatoes so I replaced with a tad extra salsa and it worked out just fine.  I will make only two changes next time:  add corn and cut out the chopped cilantro.

How great and easy and delicious!  I added some sour cream and some guacamole to our individual plates and then cut and scooped it up with tortilla chips.  Even better with less utensils to wash!

This dish is a 5 for it's simplicity and taste when the ingredients and directions are followed per the recipe. When the recipe is prepared as given, it's a great weeknight dish.  Serve with a salad and it's a meal!

This was pretty good. I modified it a tad for our tastes. I added corn to the black beans, ommitted the cilantro. I didn't have a jar of salsa on hand either. I used refried beans to save time and also added some white rice to two of the layers of refried beans( I used instant rice and mixed into the beans, something I do when I make bean, rice and cheese burritos.) I had a packet of taco seasoning so I added about a 1/3 to the refried beans. Took some shredded chicken from the dinner the night before and layered it on the second refried bean and black bean mixtures. I know that I didn't follow the recipe to the T but I would still recommend this recipe since it can be so versitile.

Very easy recipe. I used two cans refried beans to save time and added black olives as others suggested. Family loved it and I think it will become a weekend favorite.

I love the flexibility of this recipe. I've used a variety of combinations of refried beans and black beans and it always turns out great. It's also good with corn. You can change the taste of this quite a bit by using different kinds of salsas. Good with chihuahua cheese instead of the cheddar.

We love this. It's hard to give it five stars because there are so many other, more complicated flavors out there. But there's never leftovers and everyone does say it's really good. I add a few things to spice it up: chopped black olives and green onions. Also, I don't bother with the layers of filling - just throw it all together. Mix up the beans... whatever you have. I use the black beans because I usually have them but have used refried in place of pinto and kidney at times, too. Really, this is a good base for whatever you want to throw in there!

This was fast, easy to prepare and my family loved it.  I did add some black olives and increased the cilantro to 1/4 cup (we really like cilantro), I added small can of chopped green chiles to black beans.  This recipe is a keeper.

As a vegetarian, I really liked this recipe. I added fried onions to the mashed pinto beans and I cut up the tortillas and made it more like a lasagna so that I could keep it in a pan. Very good!

This is pretty good. A little less flavor than I expected, but I also like very spicy food. This would be an easy fix with some hot taco sauce/salsa or peppers.  Definitely worth a try!

Excellent! I followed the advice of the other reviews and used whole wheat tortillas; great choice! I imagine the avocado on top would also be a great addition. Just make sure to evenly spread the cilantro, as a bite full of cilantro is mighty suprising!

Yum! Awesome recipe! My husband loved it and never knew it was low fat.  I added 1/2 of a seeded jalepeno and 1/2 with seeds.  It added some kick, if you like things hot!

Wonderful!!!  The only thing I changed was to make and use my own tortillas - they wer thicker than store bought which just make this pie better!  I will make this often - my family loves Mexican food.

I've made this twice and maybe I'm doing something wrong but each time it was always just OK. The first time I thought maybe I just needed to add something else or maybe I didn't follow the recipe correctly. Nope, this just didn't do great things for me or my husband, I won't be making this again.

This is my first time attempting vegetarian cooking and my husband and I are loving it!  This recipe in particular is down-right fantastic!  So filling, so delicious, and so healthy.  It reminds you of a lasagna, without the fat from the ground beef.  For a heart-healthy alternative, you have to try this one!

Yum.  We really enjoyed this.  Made some MINOR changes to spice it up a bit since the kids wouldn't have eaten it anyway, and we prefer things with spice.  Instead of 2 cans pinto beans I used 1 can of refried and 1 can of chili beans (pinto in mild sauce).  I used about double or triple the cilantro.  Instead of 1/2 cup tomatoes, I used a can of rotel.  And I served it with guacamole in addition to sour cream.

This recipe is definately a keeper!!! Changes made (only because of lack of right ingredients): Mozzarella instead of cheddar - turned out wonderful & will probably do the same next time. Didn't use cilantro, used refried beans in place of whole pintos, used an extra 1/2 cup salsa in place of tomatoes. I like thick pieces of tortilla so next time I will put two tortillas in right on top of eachother and not make as many separate layers. Used olives too! Also ground turkey with lots of taco seasoning. Definately needs that or else it would have been too blah. I asked my family to critique it & they couldn't find anything wrong with it. A winner!:)

A little dry for my taste.  NExt time I'll use refried beans instead and guacomole in one of the layers.

I have made this several times and it is delicious! I substituted refried beans for the pinto beans and kidney beans for the black beans. I would absolutely recommend it YUM!

I am not allowed to eat beans, tomatos, and salsa but this sounded so good I made for my husband.  It took me awhile to figure out how to mash the pinto beans I made a huge mess with that but finally figured it out.  The pinto bean mixture looked gross but smelt good.  The black bean mixture smelled really bad.  I thought to myself, "what am I doing, he is not going to eat this mess"!  It calls for 7 Tortillas, but I only used 5 I do not know where the other 2 go, maybe I was supposed to double up or something?  Anyway after it cooked it still didn't look very tasty, and I was afraid he would try it and spit it out but when he tasted it his eyes got so big and he said "mmmmmmmmm oh my god its so good, I love it"  Since I'm not allowed to eat it I asked him what it taste like and he said he can't describe it but just taste like REALLY good mexican food.  I am adding this recipe to our family recipe book, its a keeper.  THANX!

This recipe was delicious! I did alter it a bit. I made my own salsa and added ground beef seasoned w/ taco seasoning. My pie plate did not fit 7 layers (only used 4). It turned out great! Thanks!

It's great as is or with a little bit of extra seasoning (cumin in the pinto beans is lush). I definitely agree with the comments stating this is a five layer pie, though - no way could I squeeze seven layers out of it.

Maybe I modified the recipe too much- but I thought this was just so so.  I had added diced green chilies to the black bean mixture, and used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses as I layed everything.  I also substituted salsa instead of picante sauce- so maybe that was my mistake.

A very good basic recipe that can be adapted for different tastes.  The result is a very dense and solid pie that does not reheat particularly well (beans get kind dry and the tortillas get mushy).  As meatless dishes go, this is one of the more satifying ones we enjoy.

This was good and very unique. It made a pretty presentation. I love the jalepenos in the recipe. This would be good with a little taco meat too if you're not vegetarian.

Good, but not as good as I thought it would be. Prep time is a lot longer than recipe says. I think I'll still make it in the future, but with a few adjustments.

This was a very easy recipe.  To reduce the fat, I substituted fatfree yogurt for the sour cream, and red sauce for the children's preference, but it was still yummmy.

I used soy cheese (shredded cheddar & pepper jack blend), imitation sour cream, and garnished with sliced olives. Very filling and tasty dish! It didn't heat all the way through in the directed cooking time, though. We might split the recipe up into several 2-layer versions and slice into bite-size pieces for our next party.

Could one more rave review hurt?
This is REALLY delicious! The recipe calls for salsa; I made my own for the recipe and put some on top also.  Here's my salsa recpie: Boil 7 Roma tomatoes and 3 serrano chili peppers for just 5 minutes or until you can remove tomato skins with tongs. DO NOT OVERCOOK! Remove skins and chili peppers stems and put in a blender. Blend with: 1/8 white onion, 1 tsp. salt, and 2 cloves of garlic. After blended very well, add 2-4 Tablespoons of fresh cilantro. Blend another 5-10 seconds, just until cilantro is chopped up a little. Try the salsa - it's DELICIOSA!

a bit bland, would add more spices the next time.  Would be much quicker if you use refried beans instead of mashing the pinto beans.  Overall pretty good.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I made it for my friends who are vegetarians and they loved it.  My carnivorous husband loved it also.  I used lower fat cheese and sour cream and used non-fat refried beans and it was a lower fat recipe!

I found the recipe to be a bit salty but overall really good and will probably make it again.  My boyfriend even liked it.

What a wonderful Mexican-inspired dish!  We do "taco" night at least once a week and this is a great dish to change things up a bit.  The garlic is what makes it so good.  
The prep time was longer than that listed, and I ended up having to stick it into the oven twice because the middle wasn't quite done.  But it was worth the wait.

I replaced the cheddar with a reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend, and I left out the cilantro, but my husband and I both loved it.  The leftovers were a great lunch for the next day, too!

We loved this recipe. My husband's a meat eater, and he liked this recipe so well that he said he didn't even miss the meat!  Very good, easy and filling.  My teenage daughters like it, but it's not one of their favorites.

My stepson is a vegetarian, so when he visits it's a chore to find something both he and my meat lover husband will like. They both LOVE this recipe and I've made it again and again. I like it too!

Delicious and filling, consumed just as merrily by the meat-eaters as the vegetarians. I served it with a box mix for Spanish rice and tortilla chips and it made a wonderful meal.

This was good, but a little dry.  I might add some guacamole next time and maybe mix some spanish rice in with the refried beans.  We'll definitely fix this again since we're trying to eat less meat, but I'll play with it some.

Just a little bit dry but nice flavor.  I would recommend it more as a sidedish than a main dish.  The pinto bean mixture is awesome, though.  My husband and I enjoyed just eating that on top of tortilla chips with some extra salsa and cheese!

This lacked the southwestern flavor that I was looking for.
It needs something to spice it up...could use some salt added, or
mabye even some kind of sauce.

I made this again for the second time, followed the exact recipe this time.  It has a very good flavor and is very easy.  I think I'll try making it in a casserole dish next time, and spread the ingredients all the way to the edges, more like a lasagna, the other way made the edges of the tortillas dry and curl up. Thanks for this recipe!

We really enjoy this recipe. I substitute one can of refried beans with chiles for one of the cans of pintos. It seems to give it a little better flavor.
