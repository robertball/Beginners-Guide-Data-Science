These are delicious cookies! I don't have refined white sugar so used half coconut sugar and half brown sugar but other than that I didn't change anything. Well, I guess I added more white chocolate chips because 1/2 cup didn't seem enough to me.... I shaped into balls but will press them down a bit next time because they didn't spread as much as I'd have liked. I'll be making these again!

These are a delicious cookie! Mine didn't turn out as pretty as bd.weld's picture, but they sure are tasty! I made 2 small adjustments. I didn't melt the butter, just used room temperature butter . . . and I also chilled the dough for a couple of hours before scooping with my small cookie scoop. Very good, and I would make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe, except for the oven temperature. I set mine to 155C as it’s a fan forced oven, and baked for 18 minutes. Turned out just right!  Thank you for this lovely recipe, will definitely be making it again!

I made these for a cookie exchange party. They are so delicious! I didn’t change a thing with the recipe. I’ll be making more tomorrow for the party. My family couldn’t stay away from them.

The recipe title says it all, "amazing." Didn't change a thing.
