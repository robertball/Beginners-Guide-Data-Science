I've been making salads all summer and I like to make my salad dressings homemade.  This recipe caught my eye as I love cilantro and always have some in the fridge waiting to be used.  The only change I made was I used Dijon mustard instead of spicy brown mustard.  Next time will add some color to my salad, like cherry tomatoes.  My salad ingredients were mixed greens, avocado, red onion and sliced chicken breast and feta.  This salad dressing is a bright green and has a crisp fresh flavor.

Great to use for summer entertaining.  

The only change I made to the lime-cilantro dressing was to add a dash of chipotle chili powder and a dash of cumin.  Before adding these, the recipe was a little too "bright" and needed some smokiness.

I used this recipe over a layered taco salad that included tri-colored tortilla strips, black beans, corn, Chopped tomatoes, quartered & seeded cucumber slices, Mexican cheese, lime wedges (garnish), avocado slices.  I made the Key West chicken recipe from Allrecipes, as another person suggested.  I LOVE these two recipes together!

I think this Key West chicken and a little of the lime-cilantro dressing drizzled over it could be pretty versatile together, even in different dishes.

(I cooked the chicken on a grill pan and then cut it into strips to serve with the salad.  With the taco salad, I also served taco-seasoned ground beef and had a bottle of Catalina dressing on hand, so people could go “old school” with their taco salad, if they wanted to do so, instead of using the chicken and lime-cilantro vinagrette.  (The Catalina bottle never got opened, though :)

I also made taco bowls by putting 10-inch flour tortillas over soup cans in the oven, on a baking sheet, baking @ 400 for 10 min, then letting cool completely so they retain their shape.

I love this light dressing!  I added a couple tablespoons, maybe less, of grated fresh ginger, and it was delicious.

Fantastic! I have also made it without any oil and just adding extra lime juice. Was just as good.
My new favorite dressing it was excellent over a green salad with fruit.

Beautiful color, and I loved the fresh bite of the cilantro and the tang of the fresh lime juice and vinegar; however, I did not care for the sweetness from the brown sugar at all.

This was delish!  I used with the Margarita Grilled Shrimp from this site over a salad of romaine, yellow peppers, tomato and red onion.  AMAZING!  The shrimp were 5 stars too!

Wow!  Sounded too good to wait to make!  Turned out delicious.  Am taking to Church today with a tossed salad.  Kinda hope we have leftovers, but doubt it!  I didn't even have to tweak, which is unusual!

Just made this quickly for salad tonight and it was fresh, light, and tasty. Didn't follow the recipe exactly, just kind of taste tested my way through until I was satisfied. I added just a little fresh spring red onion and celery seed and used a little less olive oil. Will make again, thanks!

Very simple preparation; I used my stick blender to cut down on cleanup. I also cut the oil by 1/4 to make the final product a little lower in calories. The taste is pretty good alone, but it really sang on a salad of baby greens with tomato, red onion, avocado, crumbled cotija and a sliced grilled chicken breast (I used Key West Chicken, recipe from this site). Awesome, easy-to-make combo that I will make again soon!

Very tasty!  I only modifiers slightly by reducing the amount of oil by half, and using a combination of grape seed and omega plus (olive, avocado, and flaxseed) oils.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I actually substituted lemons for limes because it was all I had and I still ended up loving it. I bet with limes it will be so much more awesome. Everyone at the bbq was commenting and asking for the recipe. I partially think you can't really go wrong with these particular flavors because they are pretty flavorful on their own and commonly used in foods. Tangy with a little sweet.. leaves a good tast. Loved it in combination with avacados and beans in my salad. Enjoy!

SO YUMMY! I will (from now on) make my own dressings. I made another vinaigrette last week from off this site, and my picky stomach agrees with my own fresh ingredients!  I did add more brown sugar (to suit my taste)......i COULD ALMOST DRINK THIS!  LOL!! (I love lime and cilantro A LOT!!)

This is great!  I love cilantro, but the lime juice definitely mellows the taste of the cilantro.  Very refreshing summer salad dressing!

Very tasty dressing and you can use it with a variety of dishes. Add some avocado to make it extra creamy and good enough to use as a dip. I would cut back a bit on the sugar next time, but this is still a great recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This recipes tastes delicious.  I have tried it as is and recently I added pure passion fruit juice to it.  HEAVEN!!  Made it taste even better.  I think the next patch, I will use pure passion fruit juice instead of the lime. That should be out of this world!

Good.  Will probably make again.  We felt it needed more something but we could not put our finger on what that something is.  I did end up adding more garlic and a bit of black pepper.  Perhaps I should not have used extra virgin olive oil.  Maybe the light olive oil would have allowed the cilantro to shine better.

Wonderful!  We started Keto so I omitted the brown sugar.  Next time I'll add an entire bunch of cilantro as we just love the stuff!   So easy and amazing.   We also changed to lime juice to Key Lime... The Floridian in me just had to.

Its wonderful!  But I tweaked it a bit.  Instead of olive oil I substituted 1/2 cup coconut yogurt.  I also added two tablespoons of spicy brown mustard instead of just 3/4 tsp.  I also think it would be great with any mustard you choose, any yogurt you choose instead of oil, and as much garlic as you like!  What's key for sure is the fresh squeezed lime juice and the fresh cilantro!  Awesome recipe!  Thanks! :-)

I made this just like the recipe.  It was awesome!  I used it as a marinade for a large steak that I grilled and then sliced over a mixed green salad.  Then used the remainder as the dressing.  It was outstanding!!   My two boys were over the moon about it.  I made it twice more within about two weeks.  Very quick and easy.

I had to make lots of changes, but I like it now and have made it a few times. I use fresh limes and include lime zest (strong antioxidant) and I measured everything exactly the 2nd time and it was still way too acidic. The lime burned the back of my throat. So I added more sugar and oil. I also thought it was bland so I added white pepper and ginger. It tastes very good that way. Every dressing recipe has garlic so sometimes I use it and other times I don't.

Dressing was excellent. It taste like a salad dressing at one of our favorite restaurants. I used 2 whole bunches of cilantro, 4 cloves of garlic, a couple of TBS of honey, rice vinegar, part olive and canola oil and no mustard. I was trying to duplicate the dressing at the restaurant. It was really good. Nice and green!! Makes you feel like you are eating healthy! But this recipe is good as written.

I think it makes a great base.  I found it good but a little bland for my taste.  I used a whole lot of cilantro because I just love cilantro and next time I too will use less oil.  Also, I added some jalapeños because I love an extra kick!

Unfortunately I had to use dried cilantro and was out of olive oil. I used canola. I paired this with tequila lime marinated chicken and a finely chopped salad with a large variety of  crunchy vegetables. I have to say it was terrific. This is an excellent salad dressing. It would go great on fish tacos.

I was a little scared to make this dressing but it was awesome. My entire family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I never write negative reviews of recipes, but this tasted pretty awful to me when it was done. The aftertaste of the mustard on top of the lime juice and vinegar gave it a very unpleasant flavor. Bummed me out since I made it for dinner guests!

Yum! the right amount of tang and sweet - added a little more salt but that was just for my preference. Also came together in 5 minutes!

I'm not sure if it was the limes I used but there was something about the tangy flavour that wasn't so fantastic. I still have it bottled and it tastes ok on salad so I'm not giving up on it just yet.

So good--better after 2 days in the fridge.  I used this to dress a bean and chopped vegetable salad.  So fresh!

Mediocre at best. Using 3/4 oil vs the stated citrus and vinegar leaves your mouth tasting like the Pacific after an oil spill.

This was really a great dressing. I did alter the ingredients slightly though, instead of white vinegar I used organic apple cider vinegar and I used 1T maple syrup instead of the brown sugar. Tasty! Will be using again!

I love this recipe, though I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup to make it more weight watchers friendly. It still is 2 points per TBS roughly. It goes well with the milder salad greens, I find. The first salad I put it on was mesclun with arugula and it was a bit much. It was much better on romaine with tomatoes. I bet this would also be good on chicken or as some kind of marinade. I plan to experiment with this. I also find it a great recipe for using up cilantro. I always seem to let bunches go bad. Now I won't ever.

I liked this except it turned out with a really bitter after-taste!What did I do wrong? Too much garlic maybe? Or was I supposed to pull the leaves off of the stems and not use the stems? Seemed like too much work to do that... ha!

Great dressing!  To make it light and creamy 1/2 the amount of olive oil, add a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard and add 1/2 cup of garbanzo beans ( chickpeas).

I doubled this recipe and tossed it with a box of orza.  Then added seedless purple grapes and toasted pinenuts.  Makes a yummy pasta salad.

Really good!
Next time, I would add less sugar, although the "sweet flavor" seemed to mellow over time.
