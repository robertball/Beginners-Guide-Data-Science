I am always looking for great crockpot recipes, and this tops the charts! Made this dip last night for Monday Night Football and while we did not enjoy the game (we are Eagles Fans) we absolutely LOVED this dip!  I halved the recipe since it was just me and my husband, and it is the perfect size for a little dipper crock pot.  this was SOOOOOO easy!!  I just got some corned beef from the store deli and tore it in strips.  Also brought the cream cheese to room temp. before putting it in.  Put the crockpot on low for about 1 and 1/2 hours and that was perfect, everything had melted and was creamy.  I served this with cocktail rye as suggested, but we actually enjoyed it more on tortilla chips!  This is going to be my staple appetizer to bring to parties b/c it is extremely easy and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe Ella!

Enjoyed this recipe!  I chopped the sauerkraut w/ kitchen scissors to make  it less messy/stringy to eat, saved the drained sauerkraut juice to add  some of it back in to moisten/thin the recipe after a few hours cooking in the crockpot.  I used low fat cream cheese,  Boreshead  Pastrami from the deli   and added " Publix's Deli Mustard w/ Horseradish", a few squirts, to add a bit more flavor.  I found that it filled a 2.5 qt Rival Crock Pot to the top.  I will definately use this recipe again and again...

Great recipe...TIP...don't use the bag kraut.  It is VERy bitter.  I used the Sweet/Mild Bavarian.  Everyone, even my 7 year old, loved it.  I never knew there was a difference until I was making Kraut and Polish.  The bag stuff was so bad, my house smelled for HOURS!

I recently made this for the first time for pitch-in lunch and received "rave" reviews.  Everyone wanted to know what was in it!  I made two minor changes.  Instead of swiss cheese, I used a shredded mix of mozzarella & smoked provolone (Sargento brand) and added about 2 teaspons more of the Thousand Island dressing.  I also doubled the recipe.  If you do this, you'll have to cook it a little longer -- approx. 1 hour on high.  Then, keep it on low until ready to serve.

This is a very easy recipe and fairly inexpensive (especially if you use the Buddig brand of corned beef).  For special occasions & to reduce additives,  I will probably use fresh corn beef from the deli.

Oh, god. Another winner. Good thing this is New Year's Eve. I can start my diet tomorrow. I doubled the thousand island dressing and served rye crisp and hunks of homemade bread. Can't find me? I'm hanging over the crockpot shoveling this dip in my face!

Very good dip! The only thing I would change is to maybe double the Thousand Island Dressing. I had it out for a few hours at work and it started to get dry and kind of crusty. I would think a little more dressing would help out with that. UPDATE: try this cold as a roll-up appetizer... Just refrigerate overnight for easier cutting. They're great!

This dip was easy and got great reviews from everyone that ate it. Quick tip, the recipe calls for 2 C. of corned beef, this is approx. 3/4 lb.  The deli lady helped me figure it out as I didn't want extra!

This was a hit during the Superbowl.  I served it with tortilla chips and added 1 cup of milk because I wanted a thinner dip- it did great in the crockpot on low during the whole game.

This is sooooo good!  I used the sweeter bavarian kraut and toasted the small cocktail rye bread slices in the oven to spread the dip on.  I added just a touch extra dressing also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Here's a tip - I got a 1/2 lb. of Chicago Style Corned Beef from the deli and had them shave it.  I then ran my knife through it for a rough chop.  It turned out to be exactly 2 cups.  Also, I found Frank's Sweet Kraut (Bavarian Style).  It's a 14 oz. can - but that was sufficient.  As another reviewer suggested, I roughly ran my knife through that as well so it wasn't stringy.

This was so good!  I threw it together for a work potluck and everyone loved it!  I had made a brisket for dinner the night before and saved half of it for this recipe.  I served it with miniature pumpernickle bread squares.  Oh...I also doubled the ammount of Thousand Island dressing b/c I LOVE it!

THIS IS FABULOUS. I ADDED 1/2 CUP THOUSAND ISLE. DRESSING INSTEAD OF 1/4 CUP AND IT WAS PERFECT.  ALSO - TRY  THE RYE TRISCUITS.  THEY ARE A MUST WITH THIS DIP.  EVERYONE JUST LOVED IT.

I've made this for years.  However, I add 1/2 teaspoon of fresh horseradish.  It actually gives it the extra zing it needs.

This was absolutely fabulous. I'm not a big sauerkraut fan but OMG, the flavor in this is amazing. Here's my slight mod on the recipe: I used 1/3c of dressing, about 1 1/2TBs of dijon mustard. We liked about 1/2c of extra corned beef.  Let it get nice and hot in the slow cooker. I set the oven to 350* and hollowed out a loaf of Rye bread then lightly toasted the loaf in the oven. After that I filled the loaf with the reuben dip, cover the loaf with slices of smokey swiss cheese and bake in the oven just until the cheese is all melted. Arrange the left over pieces of bread around the breadbowl and viola'. A gorgeous appetizer.  It also great right out of the pot with party rye or rye triscuts.

This recipe is good, but can be great!!! I have never commented on a recipe before and the changes that I made to it, but this can be made a lot lot better very easily. 

First, use half of the cream cheese called for in the recipe. Then, double the meat and the thousand Island dressing. I also used one and a half times the amount of sauerkraut called for, as well as the Swiss cheese. Then I added 1/2  teaspoon of caraway seeds and 1 teaspoon of onion powder.

Now, the key to this recipe: Sometimes when you're mixing a lot of things together you can skimp on the quality of the ingredients because they meld into one flavor. Not so here! It is imperative that you use good corned beef - I recommend using kosher corned  beef - and a high-quality Swiss. I used an imported Emmenthal Swiss. You also have to have a good thousand Island dressing. Ken's is a good pre-made dressing or you can make your own, with plenty of relish. I grilled rye bread and cut it into wedges for dipping (scooping).

This recipe is "passable" and a little bland as printed, but it tastes like a real Reuben sandwich  if you make the few changes I recommend.

Leftovers (if there are any) are great as a grilled sandwich.  Just spread on your favorite bread and grill as you would a grilled cheese sandwich.

Great recipe.  Just brought to Oktoberfest feast and guests really liked it!  Two friends of mine said "that was a dip?  My god, I just ate a whole plate of it!"  I used1/3 fat cream cheese and it was still very creamy.  FYI:  I pound of corn beef was 4 cups (doubled the recipe).  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tasty, and my family really liked it.  I did end up more than doubling the thousand island dressing, because it was a bit bland with just 1/4 cup. I also reserved the liquid from the sauerkraut, so I could add a bit whenever the dip started to look a bit dry after a few hours on warm in the crockpot.  I alternated adding a splash of the sauerkraut juice, and then next time I added a squirt of thousand island.  That worked well to keep the dip moist and easily spreadable.  We served it with rye crisps and crackers, and it was delicious on both.

This is absolutely amazing.  The BEST party dip, ever!  I go to the bakery at Publix and have them slice up some french bread or some of their sub bread and serve it with this dish.  It's amazing!  Make sure you use Bavarian Sour Kraut instead of the regular, it makes all the difference in the world!  I also add some spicy mustard for good measure.  Awesome!

This was a hit a Christmas Eve. The only difference was I used a can of drained Bavarian Sauerkraut and 1/2 pound of deli shaved corned beef. I put it in my crock pot on low and then before I served it I drizzled the Thousand Island dressing on top. Serve with some of the Triscuit Rye crackers if you can find them in your grocery store. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I brought this as an appetizer for my family's christmas eve get together - the response I received was incredible!!! Everyone raved about how delicious it was, including my husband who doesn't usually care for kraut - he could not get enough!  I used bavarian kraut, doubled the dressing, and added a bit of mozzarella and mustard with horseradish. I will definitely make this one again

Yum, and easy to make! I doubled the Thousand Island as suggested by others. Used pastrami instead of corned beef because that is what I had on hand, and it turned out great.

Just a tip: I always use bavarian style sauerkraut when I make this.  It gives it a little sweeter and more interesting taste.

I did not like it at all.  I used canned corned beef and maybe that was the problem.  It tasted bad and I know it was full of fat calories.

This was a huge hit at the family Super Bowl party last year so I'm reviving it for New Year's Eve this year! I didn't even have to use the slow cooker just heat on the stove over med low until it begins to melt then turn down to low until everything comes together. Watch the heat though. I made it twice on the stove and the 2nd time it seemed a little "grainy" because I left the heat too high for too long. I served with toasted, quartered rye bread slices and it was gone in no time.

Absolutely great. I used corned beef from the deli counter of our store, added a couple of tablespoons of horseradish and cooked it on low in the crockpot for 90 minutes. What wasn't eaten at my churchs men's meeting got polished off by the wife when I got home. It's a keeper.

Love this recipe. Have been making it for years for our Superbowl party. Wanted to let you know - my friend, Deb, says she hates sauerkraut and doesn't care for corned beef - she couldn't get enough. So, if you think this recipe sounds strange, give it a try. You'll love it!

Definately a keeper. My family loved this dip. It is really easy to make, once you boil and defat the corned beef. I use the whole corned beef, two cream cheeses, four or five cans of sour kraut and 1/2 cup of Thousand Island dressing. Soooooo good. They literally scrape the bottom of the crock. Can be served with rye or pumpernickel rye toast.

I used pastrami instead of corned beef and used probably a full cup of thousand island dressing. Not 100% sure if I cared for the cream cheese in this or if I would use cream cheese in this again... but it was still very good and creamy. Hubby loved it. Thanks!

Sorry but this was just not good.  I followed the directions as stated and used the sweet sauerkraut as recommended in the reviews.  Maybe it was the kind of sauerkraut we used but it had a very strange taste and smelled unappealing.  We like reubens but did not care for this dip!

Made for family Christmas pot luck. I wanted to serve with rye chips (since I don't like cocktail rye bread) but due to last minute Christmas grocery shopping couldn't find them.  I went with bagel chips and pretzel chips and both were great.  Will definitely make again

This was surprising bland, given all the good things in it. I added extra dressing, and then even salt and pepper. Normally I don't need flavors to hit me over the head, but this was way too subtle. Maybe I needed more corned beef and sauerkraut. I'd try it again with a few tweaks.

This was a huge hit at my daughter's graduation party. I added an extra 1/4 C 1000 Island dressing and served it with torn Pumpernickel bread. Everyone wanted the recipe. Will definitely make this again! Thanx for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I was skeptical about it because I am not a fan of sauerkraut but this is SO good.   I added about 1/2 cup of dressing and this made it just a touch creamier.   I served it with cocktail rye and rye chips but some people just ate it by the spoolfuls.   I will definately make this dip again!

This is an awesome twist to the traditional Reuben. I made it for an office luncheon & it was a hit. Prepared just as the recipe states. If home I would grill some bread & use it for a sandwich but as a dip with crackers it's great. You won't have left overs.

I was hesistant in writing this review, I thought I'd give it another chance because I didn't really hate it, but I never want to make it again. The 1st day I made this I think everyone felt as I did, eh, let me try it again, but no one wanted anymore after the second try. Suddenly I, who don't mind having fatty foods if it's flavorful, could only focus on the  fat in this recipe and I used low-fat cream cheese. In other words the taste didn't warrant me intaking all the fat. This was the only change I made to this recipe. I actually like Reuben sandwiches, but I just couldn't get into this. I came back and re-read the reviews and saw one poster suggest it cold as a roll-up. I had most of it left so I tasted it and it was better, but again, I couldn't justify eating all those calories and fat and it doesn't taste that good. So next, I reheated it and added more thousand island after heating (another suggestion from another poster) and it actually did taste better, MUCH better, yet still not good enough to want to make it again. I put it back in the 'frig, but I'm pretty sure it's on its way to the trash. Sorry this just didn't work for me. For those wanting to make this I do recommend making it a day ahead as it does taste better once all the flavors meld together and adding a little more dressing after reheating. Even though I wasn't blown away with the taste, it was definitely better after being refrigerated and reheated. I hope this helps the next person.

Every time I bring this to a potluck, others ask for the recipe.   Some comments:  2 cups of corned beef = ~3/4 lb.  Serve with rye Triscuits and/or Trader Joe's pumpernickle pretzels.  Can't go wrong with Frank's canned kraut. Not a huge kraut fan? Cut down the amount. (I use half.)

I made this recipe for last year's Super Bowl game and the crowd went wild over it!  I'm making it again this year. There are other Reuben Dip recipes out there, but I highly recommend using this one because it keep the cheese melted nicely when you make it in a slow cooker.

I wanted to love this, but it fell short. I didn't make the cornbeef from scratch, however I did get a quality brand of cornbeef from the deli counter shredded up, and used real cheese, none of that processed pre packaged stuff. It was just bland, and dried up in the crockpot after an hour,(leaving it on warm) It didn't taste like a reuben at all, I just wasn't impressed. =(

This dip was excellent!  Served it at a cocktail party and it received rave reviews.  I ordered a 1/2 lb of deli corned beef sliced fairly thick.  Then, I sliced the beef into strips.  Used canned sauerkraut- couldn't find jarred at my store.  Also, I cheated a bit and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 mins then put it into crock to keep it warm.  Served with cocktail rye squares.  Will def be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good but I think I will use less sauerkraut next time as it was a little too tangy.

This was a big hit, even with people who don't like sauerkraut! I used a pound of corned beef sliced from the deli, and a little more than just 1/4 cup of thousand island dressing but otherwise followed the recipe.  And I couldn't find the cocktail rye, so I used tortilla strips - delicious!

St. Pat's Day so of course I brought this to share at snack day at work. It was a hit to say the least. I did substitute turkey pastrami for the corned beef.

This is a great dip.  My first time having this dip is when my Gma made it and I decided to find a recipe similar to make myself.  I did add a little less kraut and next time I will add one more thing of cream cheese because I like it creamy.  Its a super fast and easy dip.  I love eating it with crackers and tortilla chips.  Its also good with baguette slices or rye bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dip needs a kick, so I added some horseradish and it made it so much tastier.  I found it to be bland without the extra punch!

Great recipe, and very easy. I put it together in just a few minutes. Made the recipe as directed but did end up adding extra thousand island dressing as other reviewers suggested.

This was a really great change from the usual crockpot dips. DH didn't care of it, but I am not sure he likes Reuben sandwiches....so that is to be expected. The only change was that I subbed 1 C of swiss for 1 C of Mozzerella as we are not big fans of Swiss. We couldn't really taste the salad dressing, so I may add more next time. I will make again!

This was great!  BF and I just loved it.  I decided to sprinkle some fennel seeds on mine and I loved that.  BF did NOT.  would be a good idea to serve this with them on the side though.  I set this out with a home made French bread, rustic bread and pumpernickel.  Was AWESOME.

Wow, I LOVE this! The second time I made this, I let it cook a little longer and doubled the 1000 Island. We tried all kinds of dippers with it and, from another reviewer, I started with tortilla chips. I thought the dip was kind of meh, but then I tried with rye Triscuits. It was sooo good! Something in the rye just works.

My husband loves Reubens so I've been holding onto this recipe waiting for an occasion to make it. Well, today on Father's day we were invited to Bbq and asked to bring an appetizer so here was my chance. My husband ate a bowl before we left and couldn't stop raving! Then we get to the party and everyone attacks and literally begins praising me on the dip.  Ummm, people, I just threw some things in a crockpot but sure, I'm amazing. LOL So here's my execution: Followed recipe except didn't measure thousand island but it was probably about a 1/2 cup. I also didn't drain the sour kraut, just used a fork to get it out of the jar so it held some moisture. For the Swiss, I bought an 8oz block and roughly shredded since I couldn't find pre-shredded and it made about 2 cups I would say. I got 1 lb of Boar's Head Corned beef and chopped it up nice and small.  Served with Rye Melba toast and Rye Triscuits.  My husband says the melba toast was much better than the triscuits so I'll just stick with those next time I make it, and according to my husband there WILL be a next time.  This is so on point to the flavors of a Reuben sandwich.  Nom nom nom

Brought this in for a Super Bowl party at work and it was a HUGE hit!  I did double the Thousand Island dressing and purchased my corned beef from the deli, asking them to shave it, and then I also chopped it to make sure there weren't any big pieces.  So, so good!

I plan to throw the corned beef and sauerkraut into a food processor for a few pulses next time to get a finer chop - if the ingredients are not chopped finely enough, the dip is a little difficult to eat (though delicious!)

YUMMY!  I also doubled the dressing and I use fresh, Boar's Head kraut from refrigerated section of the grocery instead of jarred kraut.  I serve it as a sandwich on rye toast.  Easy and delicious.

We had this tonight and I'm so glad we tried it before making a large batch.  For our tastes, the ratio of sauerkraut to corned beef is not right.  If you like a meaty Reuben, you need at least 1.5 times the meat.

can't go wrong w/this recipe.  very versatile and one can eyeball the ingredients.  I did use fat free thousand island. The store was out of rye and pumpernickel bread, so I did add some caraway seed, dill weed, and a bit of dehydrated onion to the mix to give it the rye bread part of the reuben.  *tip* make sure to rinse the kraut so it is not salty and tangy.  squeeze it well.  I used the bag variety because it always tastes fresher to me.  Used 1/2 the 32 oz. bag.  thanks for this great recipe.  this would be great warmed and used as a sandwich filling.

Incredibly easy! Threw everything in a crock pot on low for about two hours.  I did add more Russian dressing as suggested.  Chopped up the sauerkraut and 14oz. can was enough.  Was good.  Served with pumpernickel bread but good with tortilla chips and def needs something crunchy to dip.

The family loved this dip.  
I used half processed swiss, thought it might melt better, the other half Monterey Jack.  
Did not have any 'real' corned beef, used two of the packets, diced up.  
I don't like sauerkraut, and I liked this. Bought a big loaf of unsliced rye for dipping.  Just broke off hunks and slopped it up!  Yum.

Bland, bland, bland.  There is nothing of interest in this dip.  I would not make it again.  High calorie, low flavor.

I love Reubens and I loved this dip.  A coworker had brought it in for a potluck and I couldn't get enough of it!  She gave me the recipe and it is identical to this recipe.  I enjoyed it with Ritz crackers, but would definitely like to try it with cocktail rye, rye crisps, and pumpernickel as well.  Perhaps even sourdough.  Some reviewers have lamented over the fat content, but I don't believe it's intended or implied that this should be consumed on a daily basis.  Definitely a delicious treat!

Good recipe.  I used smoked brisket and I didn't have any swiss. My husband didn't even know it had kraut or cream cheese in it. ( He doesnt even care for "creamy stuff" but he liked this one)  Ummm Ummm Good!

I don't like any of the ingredients in this recipe on their own. Not too sure what provoked my making it, but it is amazing.  Others at the gathering I brought it to were amazed as well and I got emails later asking for the recipe. This is fabulous! Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  People were literally scraping the bowl to get the last of this dip!  I served it with the square mini-rye and it was amazing.  I used a little more thousand island dressing to keep it moist.  My husband has already requested this as an addition to his weekly football tailgating menu for this fall.

This is a gr8 recipe. I did take someones advise to use mozzorella in it as well as the swiss as you can never put too much cheese in any recipe!!!  it was absolutely delicious .. oh and DO NOT use canned corned beef.. it's just as nasty as spam..  I used deli corned beef and it turned out great!

This is the first thing that is requested when I am asked to bring something at an outing or party..It is so yummy.  I doubled the recipe for the last get-together.  And it was gone, right away,  I baked it, and then put it in a slow cooker to keep it warm, and i had pieces of fresh pumpernickle and fresh rye bread..I would highly recommend it.  I did mix in some mozzarella cheese with the swiss cheese

We enjoyed this dip tremendously.  I did add a bit of garlic powder to it, but it probably didn't need it.  I served it with party pumpernickel bread.  Yum!  Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious, but like other users noticed, the dip thickens and needs stirred frequently.  I added more dressing once to thin it out but gave up eventually.  Otherwise, I loved it, and so did my guests.

I made this dip last week for a birthday party.  My guests hovered around the crockpot!  It was the first appetizer to go. I had several things to scoop it with but tortilla chips seemed to be the favorite.

So...I made this recipe today just as written. I gotta say, it really wasn't bad! Was it as delicious as a Reuben sandwich? No. But it certainly satisfied my craving! Only one complaint...like others have mentioned, it was on the dry side. My fix was, I added another 1/4 cup of Thousand Island (which added a little more tang and color). Seeing how it was still a bit dry, I also added a large dollop of sour cream. This helped it become so creamy and delicious. I cut some cocktail rye breads into strips and toasted them, and it was the perfect dipper! I will definitely be making this again for my Reuben loving friends and family. Thank you so much for the recipe!

OUTSTANDING! We have some serous Rueben lovers in our family and this recipe was the #1 hit when my daughter made it for our family Christmas.I think we have found a new "must have" at future outings and events!

This was the HIT of the party. So easy to put together. Bought the corned beef in the deli. Had them slice it thick and then just chopped it up and combined with the other ingredients. Cooked it on low about 1 1/2 hours. During party would turn off crockpot the back on to warm it up. Served with toasted rye bread or Fritos. This will become a standard at all parties!

I love this recipe and always bring it as a side dish for parties. Once the skepticism wears off of people and they try it, it goes fast.  Always a hit.

I made this last weekend for a party and it was a hit. I don't care for thousand island dressing so I used the spicy ranch instead and everybody loved it.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I served it with rye Triscuits and it was delicious. According to other reviewers, a 1/2 lb corned beef = 2 cups.  I purchased it from the deli counter, chipped.

While this is a good recipe, I think the sandwich is so much better. Also next time I make this I will use Russian dressing which it which is what's supposed to be on the Ruben Sandwich.

I made this back in October for an at-work Halloween potluck.  Most of the folks wouldn't touch it because of the sauerkraut, but those of us in the know, who LOVE our Reuben sandwiches, loved it!  I did have to bring some home, and husband wouldn't even try it (sauerkraut AND corned beef), but that was OK with me...I could eat the rest of it myself!!  My only changes were to buy slabs of swiss cheese and corned beef and dice them.  I requested the deli clerk to cut the slabs about 3/4" thick.  Would definitely make again.

I have had this dip in the past and it was fabulous! I made the mistake of taking reviewer advice, and it tasted differently than what I had experienced. When. Make this again, I will use regular sauerkraut. I will not use the sweet Bavarian variety as suggested by a reviewer. I did not like it nearly as well, I also ended up throwing away more than half of the batch. I'm sure it was just a matter of preference.

Perfect football recipe. I make it the day prior and then just throw it in the slow cooker about an hour or two prior to guests arriving. Drop it to keep warm and then serve it up with rye crackers.  A little over-cooking adds to an amazing flavor (like others have posted).

This was delicious. I bought corned beef from the deli and shredded it in the food processor- it worked fine. Then I just mixed it in with the other ingredients for 1 hour on high- perfect!

I make this at least once a year, if not more, because after I made it once, everyone insists I make it for the holidays. I always double the Thousand Island dressing, which makes it a lot creamier for those of you who think it's a little too dry. I much prefer this version (with cream cheese) to the other one on the site (with mayo). Delicious!!

This was the hit of the bridal shower we just had for our future DiL.  I hardly got it in the door before the men were queuing up just because of the aroma.  The only change I made was to cook up a fresh corned-beef brisket to use.  I've been told to add this to all the major  family parties.  Perfectly wonderful dish and oh so simple to make!  Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this was awesome!  This was so easy to prepare and just delish!  I cut up 3 packages of Buddig corned beef and increased the 1000 island dressing to 1/2 cup.  My hubby ate half himself with frito scoups.  Will be making again for our July 4th party.  Perfect!

Put a brisket in the pot the night before. Nest day tested & scraped the fat off & then cut it against the grain. Followed the recipe pretty close & it was really good! Used a lot of the juice left from boiling the brisket. Next time I will use less 1000 (sort of dumped a bunch in) and use more broth & put 1000 as a topping. Also will make a butter spread with a bit of spicey mustard & horseradish to toast on the party rye. Definite keeper to experiment with!

This recipe is a winner! It's a hit at every party, and at home. I usually double the recipe, and took the suggestions to add a few squirts of deli mustard with horseradish. I use Bavarian kraut, and thick-sliced corned beef from the grocery deli, cut into small pieces with kitchen shears. Next time, I plan to make the "Slow cooker corned beef for sandwiches" from this site and use that, just to ramp it up a notch. :-) Serve with toasted marbled rye.

i tweaked it, because i can't help it. with a bit more swiss, a squirt of dijon mustard, and another of horseradish sauce, it was wonderful. just keep stiring it, and enjoy. i've done a cold version with cream cheese that turned out pretty good too...refrigerators are a great place to play. have fun with this one, it'll become a favorite in no time

Great recipe but not cheap as previously noted. I made it not as a dip but as a spread for sandwiches with rye bread - delish! I also used just 1/2 lbs of meat.

I really love ruebens so I thought I'd try making this... it was just okay... I think the flavor is just too strong for a dip.  If you do make it, however, definitely use rye bread squares as your dipper.

I made this for an appetizers and dessert party. This dip was a HIT and my Crock was empty by the end of the evening. I used deli corned beef. I ordered a pound of it and had plenty of corned beef left over. Maybe 1/2-3/4 lb would be best. This is definitely a keeper recipe and very easy to make.

Everyone who tried this dip really enjoyed it. It was easy to make and fun to have something different to bring to a party. I used freshly baked pumpernickel bread cut into 2 inch squares rather then the rye. Yummy! I had multiple requests for the recipe. I will definitely keep this in my cookbook for future gatherings.

Made this for the Superbowl and it was great served on party pumpernickel bread.  It took a little longer than 45 minutes on high to get hot and bubbly, so I left it on high for about 75 minutes total and switched to low to keep it warm.

I made this dip one time for my company Christmas party and I have now been designated to bring it to every event I'm invited to. I froze some of it and when thawing and microwaving, I add a little more 1000 Island so it doesn't dry out. Thanks!!

I've made this twice now and it's always a big hit with my guests, but not so much with me. I don't think it's very good with the cocktail rye bread -- maybe with rye chips or Wasa crackers. I used tortilla chips this time and liked it much better. I followed the advice of other users and added extra thousand island dressing.

I used deli corned beef, and it still turned out good.  I also added more cheese, both cream and swiss.  I think next time I'll add equal amounts of swiss and provolone as the swiss was a little over powering for some people.  The chips went over better than the rye bread bits, and they were cheaper too!  Overall not a bad dip.

This was a hit at my football party! I chopped the sauerkraut so it wasn't stringy.  Used corned beef from the deli, chopped up.  And added more thousand island dressing til it was the creaminess that we liked. This is going in my recipe file!

This got rave reviews from all who tried it and it was so EASY!  I kept it in the crockpot with cocktail rye beside it and let people help themselves.  After it heated in the crock pot for a while, I did add more thousand island dressing because it needed that extra zing.  The only drawback is that some people do not care for Reubens, and for those you must have a few other options available.  Those who do love reubens, LOVE LOVE LOVE this dip and want the recipe.

Low rating because I only have a question and have not made yet. I quickly read the reviews and didn't see anything about this so forgive if this is there. For the vegetarians in my family how does this taste made without the meat? I was thinking of adding the corned beef to the top of a cracker and then topping with the dip for us meat-lovers. Ideas??

If you like Reubens, then this is the dip for you. It was a nice change of pace at our football gathering. Everyone really enjoyed it.

This is super! Easy, tasty, addictive ... I enjoyed it more on crackers than on the mini rye cocktail breads, which I thought were too dry. I'll be making this a lot for parties and family gatherings.

Took this to a Birthday Party as a snack and it went so fast it wasn't funny.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My daughter-in-law first made this recipe with the bavarian kraut, but I myself love the plain kraut.  Making it again this weekend for another get-together.

I have made this recipe many times and it is awesome!  It is a unique recipe that I always get requests for when I make it!  If you happen to have any left over, it makes a good sandwich spread too... Just put it on some toasted rye.  I will make it again and again!

Oh, this was surprisingly awesome! My husband LOVES Reubens, so we thought this would be great for the Superbowl. It was, and the company we had over agreed! I used low-fat cream cheese, 1 cup of Swiss cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella, and I added a few TBS of milk... and that was about it for my changes. It was gooey and salty and tasty. We served it on rye Triscuits and tortilla chips, but next time we'll use something harder than tortilla chips as they kept breaking! Thanks for sharing, C Ella. :)

Excellent taste.  Made this today for potluck at work.  Served with pretzel chips and marble rye bread.  Since I took all ingredients to work and mixed there in a crock pot, I only had the exact ingredients called for in the recipe.  When I make again, at home, I will probably add some milk like suggested by others since it was quite thick.  Still, it was very delicious tasting.

This was fantastic!!!!  We used it on tortilla chips.  My 9 year old ate it with a fork out of the bowl.  My 21 year old said "it not only smells great it tasts so good mom!!!!  Make it again!"  I doubled this recipe and it lasted two days in my house.

I loved this stuff.  I used deli corned beef and I probably threw in a couple of extra cups.  I put in a good 1/2 cup more of the Thousand Island dressing, and about 1/2 cup of skim milk to help keep it from drying out.  They didn't have shredded Swiss, so I bought deli sliced baby Swiss, regular Swiss and a little Provolone and threw it in there and let it melt.  I let some slices melt on top for an extra cheesy layer.  It probably was much more than called for all together, but oh so yummy.  I really enjoyed it and it was so simple to throw together!  I liked it best on the Pepperidge Farm Jewish Rye bread (party loaf).  I stored the leftovers and then put a blob on top of a piece of rye and broiled them for a few minutes.  Delicious!

I just served this at a "finger food" potluck at work - used deli meat. As with other reviewers' accounts, even people who aren't fond of kraut enjoyed it.   Me, well I always need more spice than the average person...thinking what I could do to put more of an UMPH into it.

I couldn't really taste the 1,000 island dressing so I added a little dijon mustard for some kick.  I didn't have any leftovers.

Fantastic! I took this to a Chiefs tailgate last season and had to email the recipe to 6 people! You were right that even kraut-haters like this dip, one of the six didn't even realized there was any in it eventhough it's plainly visible (he thought it was cheese!) and still wanted the recipe after he found out. Decided he just hadn't had any good kraut recipes before! I also make this at home for my husband on weekends. He asks for it every week!

A bit bland and salty.  I ended up doubling the corned beef to get some flavor in here. Used toasted dark rye bread strips for dippers. An interesting change from the usual dips.

Read thru a lot of reviews, added horseradish sauce and the juice from the sauerkraut as some suggested and this was still just bland. I doubled the recipe because I was taking it to an office pot luck, but ended up dumping more than half, because nobody really liked it. This was a rare, AllRecipes fail.

This was bland and tasteless.  We love Reuben sandwiches and were very disappointed.  I doubled the thousand island dressing as others suggested but it didn't help.  It just lacks some kind of zing or spice of some kind.  We tried it with various kinds of crackers, tortilla chips, and rye bread and it was still not good.  We ended up using it as a topping for hot dogs and sprinkling it with Chicago style BBQ seasoning and red pepper flakes just to not waste the ingredients but it still wasn't  great and not worth making again.

Second time making this for a party. Always a big hit! Thank you for the deli tip for corned beef. I did use 1/2 cup of thousand island dressing just to be safe. 5 stars for sure. Served with rye bread.

Turned out great! I don’t like 1000 Island so I replaced with sour cream (which I saw on another recipe) and added about teaspoon of creamy horseradish.

I made the recipe as noted, and I will likely make it again, with some alteration.

It was very tasty but it was content heavy ... next time I'll probably add extra cream cheese and maybe sour cream to make it a little creamier/less dense.

This was so easy, and quite tasty. I got 3/4 lb shaved corned beef from the deli at my grocery store and used craft beer infused sauerkraut. I also followed the suggestion of others and used 1/2 cup thousand island. I love Swiss cheese, but the flavor ended up being a little too strong for me, so I think next time, I’d cut some of that bite with some mozzarella.

Made this in crock pot to take to a Happy Hour.  Everyone loved it.  I used one can of corned beef for the meat.  Everything else exactly the same.  Had leftovers and put it on rye toast for lunch next day.

I have made this twice now and both times people were astonished how good it was and reached out for the recipe the next day. I love Rueben sandwiches, so this was a no brainer for me. outstanding.

This will sound like a commercial, but, Use Franks German style Kraut when you make this.  It is the best.

I used two packages (8 oz. Each) of cream cheese, and a tbsp of yellow mustard. No other changes. Delish! Will absolutely make again, perhaps with pastrami & pepper cheese - just for fun.

Amazing!!!!! I used Budding brand corned beef to save on cost. I bet it would be even better with deli corned beef. Had zero left overs from our NYE gathering. Served with Triscuits.

We did not like this and were very disappointed. As others have said, we had to add more of the Thousand Island but even that didn't help. We love Reubens but this was not even mediocre. I will not be making this again.

I made this for a Christmas gathering. The crowd was 85% Southern, and I did not expect it to go over very well. There was NONE left over! 
 I added 2 Tbsp of stone ground mustard, and Swiss  AND Gruyere mixed. Gave the recipe to 5-6 people. We loved it and will definitely make it again.  It also makes a tasty sandwich spread...toasted.

This was a hit at a potluck. I did use the canned corned beef (no delis here). I accidently used 1/4 c. dressing when I was doubling the recipe and do agree that more Thousand Island would have improved it. Adding back the sauerkraut juice would also make it more spreadable.  I’m planning to add caraway seeds next time to make it even more like a Reuben and perhaps spicy mustard as others have suggested.

This was wonderful!!  Made as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  The relatives all loved it and have requested I make it for Christmas too!  I served with cocktail rye and Triscuit crackers but found out the best taste was on sea salt pita chips!

This was a hit with a gathering of friends for an evening of  board games and snacks after a fabulous meal.  I made the following changes: more than doubled the amount of thousand island dressing to 1 cup,  added 1/2 cup of shredded gran pedano Parmesan cheese, added 5 tablespoons of Horseradish deli mustard and 3 tablespoons of creamed horseradish.  This is  definitely a keeper.

I love Reubens, so it just made sense to throw this together for a football Sunday.  Glad I did.  The variable here is the crackers.  Make sure you serve with sturdy ones, and the recommendation to use rye crackers is spot on.  After all, it is a Reuben dip.

It was delicious and a big hit!!!   I actually mixed it all up and put it in the oven - I sprinkled some swiss cheese on top and that made it harder to scoop it, so I don't think I'd do that again.  The oven worked just as well as the crock pot though.  325 for 45 minutes.  Great recipe - thanks!!

Great dip! Great reviews from everyone at my memorial day get-together yesterday! I only wish I had doubled it so that there was enough for people to take some home with them! Before it cooked down, it filled my 3 quart slow cooker to the top. I doubled the thousand island dressing, added 1/4 ts onion powder, and 1 TB Dijon mustard. Will be making this again!

This is something I would only make for St. Patrick's Day.  I love a good reuben sandwich, but I wasn't wowed by this dip. I'm going to add extra corn beef to the remaining dip and try it as a wrap.

Made the recipe as written, with just a little more homemade thousand island. Our stores don't carry Bavarian kraut, so I just used a regular canned store brand, and it was delicious.

Loved it,  so easy to make. I needed it fast so I made it on the stove and then put it in a small crock pot to keep warm for a New Year's Day party.

Recipe is perfect. I served with pumpernickel cocktail bread, toasted. Some guests didn't like sauerkraut so wouldn't even try it which left more for the folks that did like it. Was asked by 2 friends for the recipe. So easy, so tasty.

Delicious ?? Used pastrami instead of corned beef. Oven toasted some regular rye bread cut in pieces drizzeled with olive oil.

Taste was just OK.  Made the mistake of using canned corned beef and didn't realize hue nasty it was!!  If I make this again I'll use the real stuff.

This was awesome!  I used my spread that I make for Rueben sandwiches, ketchup, mayo and grainey Dijon mustard in place of the thousand island.  Served with glueten free, organic scoops and roasted garlic, rye Gardetto's chips.  I will make again!

OMG!  I put all the ingredients in my small crock pot, then took it to our annual tailgate party and plugged it in. It was the hit of the night...so melty and delicious on rye Triscuits and pieces of rye bread I put out.

Simple, tasty and easy to prepare - add another 1/4 cup of Thousand Island dressing.  I'll be using the leftovers for sandwiches.  I used quality sliced corned beef cubed up.  I imagine it would be best with fresh shredded meat as the recipe states.

Made this in a pinch for a birthday party. It is so simple & so quick to make! Everybody loved it! 
I used a pound & a half of pastrami & doubled the recipe. It was perfect! This will be my new go to!

I have made this three times, and the last time I took it  to a potluck at work and had to give the recipe to several people that raved about it.  One of these coworkers has since brought this to a gathering and was getting lots of compliments as well.

This dip was wonderful!  My husband and I couldn't stay out of it!  I followed suggestions and used corned beef shaved fresh from the deli,  1 cup of the thousand island dressing, I used canned shredded sauer kraut, and it was so good!  This is a staple dip from now on around here.

I didn't like this at all.  I used real emmentall, ken's 1000 dressing, corned beef from the deli, sweet kraut and followed the recipe.  A few people at the party liked it but I took most of it home.

This recipe is good just very plain. It definitely needs more thousand island or some brown mustard or something added to it. I will be running out in a minute to add something to it to bring a little more flavor to it; otherwise it is good.

I doubled the Thousand Island as suggested and got really good corned beef shaved thin from the local deli. About 3/4 pound when in the dip and 1/4 pound went in my mouth while cooking.

I'm not even much of a reuben fan, but I really liked this dip -- as did the other partiers! I thought I might have to double the recipe, but one batch really does make a lot, especially if you're going to a potluck setting where there's a lot of other food. Once the dip is heated through and is nice and creamy, you'll want to change the heat setting to low, but even as it got a little browned and crispy around the edges, we decided that was the best part! By the way, a lot of others have said they doubled the 1000 island dressing, but I didn't think that was necessary (then again, I'm not a huge 1000 Island fan, either!)

Such great flavor!  Bavarian style sauerkraut worked great.  Added a bunch more dressing.

Very good, especially with leftover corned beef brisket, but I added quite a bit more 1000 island dressing.

I brought this to our work Christmas party.  I used a pound of corned beef from the deli, then doubled everything else - except for the russian dressing.  I just poured tip it looked good.  I used mozzarella instead of the swiss, only because the store didn't have shredded swiss and I didn't want to spend $10 on the block of swiss since I already spent that much on the corned beef.  Anyway, the entire crockpot was eaten and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I brought this to a large holiday party and it wasn't really touched.  I served this at my home, to a smaller group, and they were literally scraping the crock pot.  The difference?  I was able to tell my small group what it was so it became a more approachable dip.  Advice?  Make sure to include a small place card of some sort describing it as a rueben dip if serving to a large group.  I used turkey pastrami and added more 1000 island as suggested.  I didn't see a need to re-moisten with more dressing or sauerkraut juice as some suggested and my dip sat for several hours.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe!! I made this for Christmas at my inlaws this year and it was such a hit! It was easy to put together and tasted just like a reuben sandwhich. We used multigrain crackers and it was delish!! Highly recommend if you like reubens!

This is wonderful.  My sister-in-law always made this recipe.  I never really measure anything and go by taste when adding 1000 island dressing.  I also make my own dressing, which I think tastes way better than store bought.  This dip is always the first to go at a potluck or party.

This was super. I doubled it for a football party and still had tons left over, but had great comments by guest.  I probably wouldn't double it next time becuase it can get king of expensive for the corned beef.

Fantabulous!  I took this to a pot luck and it was a hit....had several people ask for the recipe.  I used thinly sliced Boar's Head deli corned beef and can't wait to try it with leftover slow cooked corned beef.

I had high hopes for this, but it was a major disappointment.  I kept adding more dressing and spicy mustard, but it just stayed bland. Will not be making again.

I'm in the minority here. We didn't like this at all. To us, it seriously lacked flavor. It tasted slightly better when dipped with tortilla chips rather than rye bread, but I still won't be making this again.

This was pretty good. I've made it a couple of times, and will make it again. It seems to dry out rather quickly, so I add some extra thousand island dressing, or even a little bit of water during the event just to keep it creamy. If you like reuben sandwiches, you'll like this.

I have made this twice now.  The first time was on A Saturday night during a snowstorm and brought it to the Fire Dept whare hubby is a volunteer.  I FORGOT to add the swiss cheese and got RAVE reviews!  4 days later, I took it to a potluck at work (I remembered the swiss cheese this time), and out of 9 people, 5 asked me for the recipe.  This dip is awesome!

For our family, deleting the Thousand Island dressing and replacing with 1/2 c. mayonnaise made it just right for us.  We have served it with the little rye stick crackers and it is so good with those.

This is a great recipe and sooo good!  I love reubens and this was a hit at work when I made it for lunch.  Even my friend who said she didn't like sauerkraut liked it.  Once when I made it I couldn't find any corned beef in my deli section and so substituted a can of corned beef, and that worked really well too.  Will definitely make it again many times!

This dip is very hearty and good! It was a little expensive to make but I'll definitely do it again for a special occasion. I served this at 4th of July and at the end of the evening there was still a heaping bowl left which surprised me.

Made this recipe for Superbowl Sunday. I don't eat corned beef or sauerkraut but this recipe was fantastic!!!! I doubled the 1000 island dressing as other reviews stated and I bought the corned beef from the deli. We will be making this again!

The only changes I made were to double the dressing as others have suggested and I added a squirt of mayonaise and some caraway seed. I have made this several times now and everyone loves it! Thank you!!!!!

First-reuben dip is awesome!  
Second- DO NOT use canned corned beef...I can't even fathom how nasty that would taste.
Lastly-Don't rate a recipe low because you have a question about it-that's rude. My suggestion would be to try a batch before serving it to any vegetarian guests/family to see how it tastes.  Do they like meatless reubens? If so they'd probably like it.  The ingredients are cheap so whip up a batch and see how it goes over. 
Thanks for sharing!

This was good but missing something, so I added 1/4 cup more of thousand island dressing and about 2 tablespoons horseradish.  Made all the difference.

VERY GOOD!! Everyone at work loved this! I barely had to clean the slow cooker it was scraped so clean.  I completely forgot to add the cream cheese so it wasn't as creamy & dip like as it could have been but everyone still loved it.  Next time I will be sure to add the cream cheese - I can only imagine it will add to the flavor.  Did take the advice of increasing the Thousand Island dressing which turned out to be a good thing since I forgot the cream cheese.

This is a great party dish.  Doubled the recipe.  Used deli cornbeef and took the advise of others and added extra salad dressing.  Served with both bakery rye and chips.  So simple, so good!  It's a keeper.

I made this for a party, and doubled the recipe. I had alot of appetizers, and this one was gone when I cleaned up.Even my teenagers raved to me about it. I ended up baking this in the oven. I would definately make it again.

What you'd expect it to taste like.  I used fat free cream cheese with no problem.  It was hard to find shredded swiss, so I just cut up 8 oz. of sliced swiss to get an equivalent amount.  Enjoy!

Phenomenal!!!!  Served it on pepperidge farms pumper dark and jewish rye, party loaves.  My husband wouldn't quit picking at it as it warmed in the crockpot, and so many people at my son's birthday party told me how delicious it was, trying to guess the ingredients.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.

This is the easiest ever, and I've never heard as many rave reviews!  It filled my 3 quart slow cooker two-thirds full, and it was scraped clean by the end of the evening. No changes to the recipe.

Mmmmm!!  So yummy!  I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is REALLY easy to make and great for potlucks.  I made and served it to three different crowds in one week and everyone was very complimentary.  I will definitely keep this recipe and you can be sure I will be bringing it to more potlucks!

I made this dip for a cookout and it was a hit!  I did add more dressing to make it a bit more creamy. My neighbor has already made it for a get together as well!!  I will definitely make it again!

My husband loved this. I don't eat sauerkraut, but everyone who typically enjoys reubens seemed to like this. I used sliced corned beef and just cut it up. It did great as an appetizer in the crock pot for my daughter's 1st birthday party.

Needed to make in a hurry so mixed everything together and nuked in microwave for 4 min.  Then put on high for 30 min.  Very good.  Doubled thousand island dressing.

This is getting 5 stars because of the response it got at a party, but  thought it needed a little something.  I'll definitely make it again, but I may try to jazz it up a bit.

This was a delicious recipe and a great use of the crockpot that had been collecting dust for a while.  I found myself adding more Thousand Island dressing to keep the moisture up, but this was very well-received and was served with rye toast crackers as well as Scoops tortilla chips.  It's important to keep the crockpot on low and stir occasionally; it will get very thick and difficult to scoop as it cools. Overall, terrific flavor!

I made this for a party.  It was a hit.  I did triple the amount of thousand island dressing.  I served it with rye bread squares and corn chips.  Most people prefered the corn chips.

Wonderful!  Will make again for positive.  Used a little extra sauerkraut and dressing along with deli corned beef slices.  Added a little shredded provolone mix cheese as suggested by another review along with the swiss.  We LOVE it!

Quick and easy, everyone seemed to like it that tried it. I don't eat, corned beef, sauerkraut or thousand island so it kind of left me out. The appearance was not very appetizing. But would probably make it again

Dip was great and someone who did not like saurkraut couldn't stop eating it.  For those of us that do like saurkraut though, I wish I could get a little bit more of that saurkraut flavor, that was the only thing that was missing for me.
