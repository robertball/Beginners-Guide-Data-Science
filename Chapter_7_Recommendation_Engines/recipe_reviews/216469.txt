My husband and I like Indian food, so this is good if you are looking for something with an Indian flare. (Referring to Indian from India, not American Indian).  It was not really a traditional American holiday casserole.  It tasted very heavily of balsamic vinegar and was more of a soupy texture.  I served it along side the holiday meal, but not many were brave enough to taste it.

Hands down the most disgusting dish I've ever made.  Random ingredients that did not even begin to meld well together.  Our outdoor dog wouldn't even touch it.

Too sweet, tangy and soupy.
