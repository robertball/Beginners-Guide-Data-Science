Nice straight forward recipe.  If you don't have self rising flour, no worries.  Use all purpose flour and add 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt for each cup of flour.   I did beer batter fish with a light Mexican beer.   Very nice.

Tastes great! The comment about using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder w/ 1/2 teaspoon salt per cup of flour in regular flour worked perfectly. I used a pale ale and it was fantastic.

I've tried a few different beer batter recipes and they're good, but they're not perfect. I came across this one and my first thought was, "no egg?! how?!" I was so wrong. It doesn't need anything else. 

I seasoned the fish before I dropped them into the batter with small amounts each of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. The batter is very thick and lumpy, which concerned me at first, but I followed the directions letter for letter and it was excellent.

My fish was so light and crispy I wanted to cry. We had some leftover fish so the next day I placed the cold, cooked fish on a baking rack and popped them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes or so. They crisped up well.

I'm so happy to have found the perfect beer batter!!

Made with gluten free self raising flour and gluten free Hahns ultra Chrisp beer. Was the best batter just as good a using wheat flour.
My wife who is coeliac and hadn’t had beer batter before was over the moon with it.

I read the other reviews carefully.   I didn't have self rising flour so I added the baking soda and salt.   I also added garlic powder, paprika,  and cayenne.   Was skeptical but oh my!   Such a light batter, crispy and flavorful.  It's a keeper.

Delish! I was looking for a beer batter that didn't have eggs (due to allergy) and this was spot on! Thank you poster that said to use 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.

I used plain flour, teaspoon salt and same of baking powder and whisked by eye to get the right consistency. Very easy, worked well. Classic fish and chips!
