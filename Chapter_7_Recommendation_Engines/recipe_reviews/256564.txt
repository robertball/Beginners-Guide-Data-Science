I made this fantastic recipe but added an extra banana, substituted arrow root for xanthin gum, and added mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. The mini muffin pan was done in 15 minutes at 350. Put four in a bag, making 8 bags and saved the rest for eating warm. We’ll grab them for breakfast or I’ll put them in lunch bags as dessert. Delicious!

I've made this twice already, and I'm getting ready to make it again. My family really likes it! I've made no changes to the recipe except to add about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips. The second time I made it, I had only 2 bananas so I added an eyeballed amount of applesauce, approximately the same as a mushed banana, in place of the third banana. There was no texture change and only a very slight flavor change to the finished banana bread; it was still very good. Today when I make it, I'll have to do the same thing, since again I have only 2 bananas. 

We live at about 6,300 feet in elevation, and I made NO high altitude adjustments. The gluten-free flour I use is Bob's Red Mill.

At first, I didn't care for this. I thought it was moist and even fragrant, but found the taste to be somewhat bitter and the banana taste was hard to detect.  After a friend suggested freezing some slices to be toasted later - wow! I changed my mind. I really enjoyed its second life. Easy to make being a one-bowl mess, this a keeper recipe. Next time, I'll add another banana. Thank you for the recipe.

It was a little thick so I had to add some water. I would make it again.

I just made this. Modified as follows: added 1T. gf all purpose flour (for altitude), only used 2 t. regular vanilla. Baked at 355 degrees, for 50 min. DN use parchment paper, greased the loaf pan. Used scant 1/3 c. walnuts and 1/3 c. choc. chips. 

It is delish!!! Not too sweet. Great texture, rises nicely. Will definitely make again! Yum!
