I've had many wonderful ceviches in Central and South America, this recipe is very close.  The halibut worked great.  I did make some alterations based on the ingredients I had.  I replaced the mango with fresh chopped tomatoes, didn't use any parsley used all fresh cilantro, only used red onion and added celery as well as the jalepenos.  I used about the same ratio of limes and lemons, slightly more lime juice.  Added a little olive oil, no tequila but still may add that, sounds good.  Also added a little bit of lite coconut milk, some of the best ceviche I ever had was in Colombia where they added coconut milk, very tasty.  Again great recipe, it covers all the basics for a good traditional ceviche.  Buen apetito!

The flavors were perfect, but learn from my mistake!  I used frozen mango, which tasted fine, but didn't hold its shape and got a bit mushy.  Not so appetizing in appearance.  Stick with fresh, it will be worth it!  Also, we used scallops instead of halibut and loved the results!

Excellent recipe! I did not add the bell peppers, parsly, or tequila but it still tasted fantastic. I subbed diced roma tomatoes and cucumbers. I highly recommend using fresh halibut cheeks instead of regular halibut for this recipe. It will make it very tender. Whole Foods carries them fresh daily.

Great recipe.  It makes a lot - I brought some to my neighbor and STILL had some left over.  I followed the directions perfectly and it was great!

This was delicious!  I skipped the tequila and only marinated the halibut and jalepeno.  Then, I mixed fresh mango, red bell pepper, onion, garlic  and tomato together and added the halibut and jalepeno.  Very simple to make but would be impressive for guests.

Very very good recipe for Ceviche fans. You will need excellent quality Halibut, extremely fresh. The mango really makes this differently delicious.

Good flavor and easy to make.. For my taste i would let it sit for another hour or so. My fish was still a bit raw in the middle.

LOVED this!! I used sole fillets instead of halibut, took out the tequila )the kids were going to eat it so I was worried about putting alcohol in) and halved the onion/bell pepper so there was more fish in each bite. It was sooo good!

Pretty much followed to a T, a little too much cilantro for my liking. I enjoyed the tequila flavor, but prefer a more traditional ceviche

I have been making ceviche for years, mainly with fresh dorado (mahi-mahi) that I fish in my home waters (Caribbean). Halibut is not a warm water fish, but you can buy frozen really inexpensive. I had a few fillets that I had thawed, cut them up in bite size pieces and used this recipe. This is a great recipe, very similar to how I have made it for many years, but adds mango and tequila; what a great touch! Use Kosher salt, as it makes a difference, also add fresh ground black pepper. If you like a less acidic ceviche, prior to serving drain the marinade liquid into a bowl and add coconut milk to your taste. You can also add ketchup, 1 or 2 teaspoons. Fresh fish is better, but if all you can find is frozen fish from a reputable brand, this is a good way to use that fish.
