We all enjoyed this tremendously - I used one pound of ground turkey (not sausage), two cans of diced chili-ready tomatoes and added carrots.  I found that I needed more broth to thin it up a bit - ended up adding two more cups.  I also felt it needed lots more cumin, salt, and pepper.  We served with whole wheat naan bread and everyone cleaned their bowls!  Very healthy dish - good for your heart!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  It was hearty enough without being overly heavy and the flavor was good, but not too strong.  I made the recipe without any modifications and I would make it the same way again.

I thought this was a really nice recipe.  I am not a big fan of pork sausage, but I did like the turkey sausage.  I omitted the celery as I also don't care for celery.  And I cut down on the garlic by 1/2.  I love garlic, but I think you would have only tasted garlic had I put in the full amount called for.  I also lightened it up a bit by adding a little chicken stock, as indeed, it is very thick.  And I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  But dang!  This was pretty good!!  Served it with warm crusty sour dough rolls, and it was a very full meal.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very, very good.  I only had one cup of Lentils so I added a cup of split green peas.  This was a great addition.  I also used only 1 quarts broth  instead of2 to get a thicker chili.  I also added a little corn to give a nice sweet crunch

Loved it.  I chopped up two red bell peppers and added them to the vegetables and they added a delicious flavor.

I didn't have any turkey sausage, so I used some grilled chicken breasts instead. The chili was a hit at my school's chili cookoff!

A favorite of mine - make it at least once a month.  Healthy, tasty, etc.  I do add more spices as other reviewers recommended.

Holy cow was this delicious! I almost didn't make it because we are such chili purists, but I'm stoked that I did! I added three chopped jalapenos because we like it spicy. I also used ground chicken instead of the turkey sausage, and low sodium chicken broth. I will make this again and again with which ever meats I have available. So healthy! Thanks a million for this one!

Very good recipe. I changed the yogurt to low fat sour cream. The lentils make this hearty and healthy. I will make this again for superbowl Sunday!

This came out good! With a little doctoring, this recipe is a 5. I didn't need the whole 12 servings, so I cut it back to 6 and kept the garlic and seasoning amounts at 12. I added a bit of salt and pepper, a few shakes of pepper sauce, 1 tsp of chicken broth powder and used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the regular toms called for. In the end, I added about a tsp of a high quality chili powder and it was just the polishing the chili needed. Be careful with cooking the sausage through with the garlic. Garlic burns easily, so I added mine once the sausage was done, and cooked until fragrant, before adding the tomatoes. This isn't a traditional chili, but whatever you call it, it's delicious.

i loved this "chili"!  My kids liked it as well.  I used ground turkey (93%lean) as that is what I had on hand, and subsequently I think I should have increased the spices more as my version lacked the spices already in the sausage.  Regardless, it was excellent.

This is such a simple awesome recipe. Easy ingredients and easy instructions.  We have made this several times.  It should be something on the Hungry Girl web site as it is so healthy and low in fat and all the stuff she promotes!  Try it and tweek it if you like it spicier but I am fine with it... Not sure why it's called chili but yummy!

This was surprisingly good.  My husband says he doesn't like the lintels much.  Since lintels don't have much flavor I assume that means he doesn't like their texture so I might try blending them next time or perhaps purposely overcooking them so they are extra soft.  He also doesn't like tomatoes so I used baby tomatoes so I could easily keep them off his plate.  I left off the yogurt and parsley, it didn't need it and I think it might detract from the flavor.

Excellent!  While we would not refer to this as chili (more like soup to us), regardless, it was still fantastic!  Really easy to throw together and very healthy.  I did about one and a half times of all of my spices and the flavour was really nice, not too  overpowering.  I didn't have tomatoes, so added a 28oz can of diced.  I used orange lentils as that was all I had, and I didn't boil them for the 10 mins with the broth as I find they tend to cook fairly quick.  Also used ground turkey, not turkey sausage.  Left out the yogurt at the end, liked the idea of it better without!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is really, really good.  I used ground turkey, chicken broth, halved the recipe using the same amount of seasonings, and omitted the yogurt based on others' reviews.  I also added a little ground coriander (just because I had it and it seemed appropriate).  I'm planning on making another batch to take for lunches.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious!  Like others, I made with pork sausage because that's what I had on hand.  When I make it again, I will use turkey sausage.  The only other thing I thought was missing was chili powder and cayenne.  So I added a tablespoon and a dash of cayenne, because I like chili to be a little spicy.   I also didn't have tomatoes, so I used a large can of crushed tomatoes.  It worked out perfectly!  This is a very hearty, filling, delicious version of chili!  Loved it!!!

Awesome! Followed the directions with the exception of adding 2 cans of diced tomato in place of the fresh tomato and doubled the spices.  The sour cream didn't appeal to me when I was first reading the directions, but after trying a bowl of chili with and without the sour cream, I must say that the sour cream and parsley definitely make this dish even better.

I'd call it more of a stew than a chili.  If was different, but very good.  I served it with cornbread.

My family really liked this.  I made a couple of changes.  I did not have any tomatoes, so I used the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce I had in the cupboard.  I also used chicken broth.  Thanks, I will make this again!

I made this recipe with about 1.3 pounds of ground turkey and added spices from a recipe for ground turkey sausage.  I then made the dish as listed and it turned out great.  It's flavorful, healthy, and quick to make.

I made this as a soup so I just added more liquid. I used a combination of broth, vegetable, beef and chicken. I did not have the turmeric or the yogurt. This was DELICIOUS, EASY and QUICK. Will make again often.

Very Good! Simple and tasty. Made some changes since I didn't have everything on hand. 
- Instead of 2 qts vegetable broth, I used 1 qt chicken broth and 1 qt water. 
- Used 3 cloves of garlic
- I didn't have cumin or thyme, so I added some chili powder instead.
- Only had canned diced tomatoes on hand, so I used those instead of fresh tomatoes.
- Left out the yogurt as I'm not a fan of it.

The boyfriend had seconds!

Fantastic and hearty! I substituted zucchini for celery (added celery salt), ginger for turmeric and rotisserie chicken for the turkey sausage. I added some more spice using about a tsp of Chipotle Tabasco. It got rave reviews. The spices really give this soup the best flavor.

I really liked this recipe. I made a few changes though. I used 1 cup of salsa instead of tomatoes, and ground turkey instead of turkey sausage. I omitted the celery and used mushrooms instead. I also didn't use the vegetable broth or the parsley. I used chicken broth. I didn't use the yogurt because I am lactose intolerant. I added the salsa because it gave the chili a lot more flavor. I served the chili with quinoa.

As one son said: Doesn't look that good, but tastes yummy.  Used turkey broth and ground turkey, and therefore multiplied the garlic and rest of spices by 1.5 and added 1.5 tsp of chilli powder.  Added 2 tsp of sea salt.  Still fairly mild but just right for the range of tastes for my family.

I've made this before and it was REALLY good! My 7-1/2 year son added some cinnamon, and it was tasty! We'll make it again today, the same way, after sledding in our snow-covered coastal area.

This was easy to make and it made enough for my boyfriend and I to eat dinner and both have lunch for 2 more days.  Instead of turkey, I used meatless crumbles and it was still very good.

I found this recipe in the Perricone Prescription also.  I tried it with Pork sausage once and  it was pretty good.  I think I like his healthier version best.

Not quite what I was expecting, but very good!  Mine came out very liquidy, more like soup than chili, so I cooked up some macaroni to mix in with it.

Yummy. I used ground pork because of a turkey recall. Left out the yogurt and topped it with crushed tortilla chips for more texture. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good and fast. I made it just as written with only one change: adding carrots. One piece of advice: next time I will brown the sausage by itself and drain it well, before adding onions and celery. I didn't get a chance to drain it and it was quite greasy around the edges. The flavor was great. Even my picky husband, 3 and 5 year old ate some. I will make this one again for sure.

Very good! Added 2 carrots and used canned diced tomatos instead of fresh. Turned out a bit watery, but really good. Next time will try adding more veggies (peppers) and maybe brown rice.

This was great and really easy to make.  My husband even went for a second helping!

The only variation I made was, I didn't have ground turkey, so I just shredded a turkey breast and used that instead.  It turned out great.  I will make this recipe again and pass it on to friends.

I made this and we loved it.  I will make it again during the winter.  We found it gave us gas...just being honest here...but eating a little at a time is best, or put some beano on it.  It's hard to eat just a little, it really is tasty!

I recently saw a cooking show where cooks were encouraged to seek and find “soon to expire” fresh and canned vegetables. So used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a can of black beans [washed & drained]. We are not big sausage eaters, so I found a sausage recipe and extracted the spices [marjoram leaves, cloves, brown sugar]. Added some salt and pepper. Nice soup for a cold, wintry day. And pretty healthy, too.

This really is so flavorful. I used 2 lbs ground turkey, lean, 1/4 lb pork sausage, fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh, added a can of yellow corn. Also really upped the garlic, cumin, turmeric. Kept other spices as called for. Truly so flavorful my boys forgot it wasn’t traditional chili. I must say a tad bit of sour cream on top puts THIS OVER THE TOP!

This was really good! My family loved it. I didn't use the thyme and I added a little chili powder.  I will definitely make this again.

Ok so I'm rating this even though I made some changes... but... I have to because it was amazing!  I had a bunch of veggies to use up and threw them in; as well, I used deli chicken, cubed, instead of sausage.  And I didn't skin/seed my tomatoes.  And I used half chicken stock, half veggie because that's what I had at home.  But really, the base is what I'm rating.  I used a tablespoon each of the cumin and turmeric, having read other comments.  Didn't have thyme but was liberal with the salt and pepper.  The flavours in this dish just burst!  The dollop of plain yogurt (I used plain Greek yogurt) on top makes for a wonderful contrast to the broth which has just the right amount of kick to it (oh, I threw in a chopped banana pepper, seeds and all).  Will make this again and again, thank you!

Lacked flavour. I had to exclude the celery because we didn't have any at the house. I subbed celery salt for the celery & salt, though. Also had to sub chicken broth for two of the cans of vegetable broth, as I only had one can let of vegetable broth. Apart from that, made exactly as stated. I think I needed to simmer the lentels longer than stated, though. They still seemed quite hard when I ate them. Hoping leftovers are better due to sitting in the liquid over night. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't my favorite. I plan to make it again and perhaps throw in something else for flavor. :)

It was ok.  Made it just as written.  Have had this at others homes and it was not the same.  Most likely will continue to try other recipes.

Liked it but did not love it - thus the 4 stars.  A bit bland - am sure it could be spiced up.  Filling and healthy so it's got that going for it!  The yogurt a nice touch too.

This is awesome! My mother who hates vegetable soup and lentils even LOVED this! The only things I did differently was that I had to use chicken and kale sausage because it was all I had. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt, and just added it to the pot instead of adding it to each individual bowl. YUM! Thanks!

Awesome recipe. I modified it by adding spinach. I used one pound of ground turkey and mixed in garlic powder, cumin, and a spice mixture including black pepper, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, and marjoram. I used cumin, chipotle, coriander and the cinnamon spice mixture in the broth. I added a little pit of lime juice to balance out the sweetness from the tomatoes.

Decent flavor, and has lots of potential and we're going to play with it.  Suggest to alter the turkey ingredient to state "bulk turkey sausage".  Depending on the type of lentil used, you need to simmer more or less time.  Adding yoghurt is a must - tastes great!  Perhas briefly saute the parsley in butter before adding it.

I loved this recipe! I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and toasted portuguese rolls to go with it. The pickiest eater in my family even liked it.

My non-adventerous husband LOVED this recipe.  I have bragged to everyone I know about it and will be passing it out today.  Can't wait to make it again.

Wow!!!!! This chili was a huge hit with my family!!! Flavorful and filling is hard to find in a dish that is also healthy and inexpensive (as long as you already have the spices). This is going in my permanent cookbook. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I did add a little feta to the top and cilantro instead of parsley because we had it but I'm sure it would be just as amazing exactly as written.

This was wonderful!  The whole family was asking for more.  Even the "picky" eaters!!
