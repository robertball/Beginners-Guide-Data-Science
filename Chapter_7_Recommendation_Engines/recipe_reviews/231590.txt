I wanted to make this recipe mainly for the colored egg part; however, I did scale it down and follow the recipe exactly. I hated the boiling method because it was a pain to get the shells off. My tried and true method never fails me, whether the eggs are fresh or old. So I will stick to that. I scaled the recipe down to try the filling and my husband said, "Where's the pickle relish?" I didn't think it was anything special either, so I made the rest according to my usual recipe with pickle relish and mayo. I had to double the food coloring to get the shade I wanted and it took about 15 minutes of soaking time. I think the colored deviled eggs will be a fun addition to the Easter dinner menu, especially for the Grands.

I did add just a little Worcestershire sauce and some vinegar to the filling, but that's just a personal taste preference.  This is a fun way to style up Easter Eggs and turn an ordinary deviled egg into one with more eye appeal.  Good idea Nancy Clancy.

I've saved this recipe in my recipe box a while ago but I tried for the first time Saturday and boy am I glad I saved the recipe ~ The eggs came out so beautiful.  I received a lot of rave over them ~

I thought this was a great idea from the start and now there will be other ladies in the church trying out this simple but great idea of a recipe ~ They're not just for Easter but can be used for gatherings such as baby showers, etc.

Thank you Nancy Clancy for posting your recipe ~

Sincerely,

Mrs. Robin Burns

Very creative, and fun! :)  I just recently found a way to hard-boil eggs without a water bath...STEAM them, instead! Start water up to boiling in a deep saucepot that has a steamer insert available (put the steamer insert in right away when you turn the stovetop on, as well as the lid for the pot). When the water is at a rapid boil, carefully (I use a long-handled spoon) place the raw eggs into the pot, cover with the lid, and steam for 6 minutes for soft-boiled, 12 minutes for hard boiled. The shells come off beautifully, even if the eggs are right from the henhouse that day! :)
I also made sure to steep the whites in the food color bath for 15 minutes, and they turned out beautiful! We used some pastel liquid food coloring I had on hand...perfect for Easter!

These came out so pretty on a little Easter chick plate. I subbed mayo for the salad dressing just for personal taste. It was much easier to make than i had expected. Thank you very much for sharing. I'm sure i'll have these next year too. Lol and follow Nancy's advice......put some white ones in there too, the coloring is great but may not be for all of your guests. 8)

These were a huge hit at Easter!  I eliminated the mustard and hot sauce as these were made mainly for kids as an alternative to the other egg dishes I was serving for brunch.  Not only did the kids eat them so did all of the adults.  The visual display on the table made them a “must have” for everyone!

I did a little alteration, my sons birthday theme is "monsters" so I used sliced green and black olives on the top instead of paprika. Turned out amazing!!! Everyone loved them!

It takes a couple minutes to allow the die to soak in but they come out great! I don't add hot sauce to the filling but I do cut up a couple pieces of bacon and add it!!

The 5 stars is for the coloring technique since I just made my own filling. You do need to let them sit for awhile if you want really dark colors but 10 min worked for me although my green and teal looked almost the same but I am sure that’s my fault :)

These eggs were easy and a hit at Easter.  I did not add any hot spice because the kids were going to be eating them as well as the adults!  They disappeared quickly!

I used my usual recipe for deviled eggs....I'm sure everyone has one....and just colored the whites.  They looked VERY festive and everyone wanted to know how to do it. The dyeing took a bit longer to set the color than I expected so keep that in mind.

So festive and so easy!  Use any deviled egg recipe you like.  This is standard gold.  The colors are glorious.  just be sure to turn or move the eggs for even color.

I made these this morning for Easter dinner table.  They are so attractive.  I made exactly per recipe.  I tasted and added some dill pickle relish, that's how my son likes deviled eggs.  I love this recipe. I'll be using it often.

I just made these for Easter dinner tomorrow. I make my own filling so I didn’t use the recipe but I dyed the egg whites. I mixed red and blue and they came out good. Yellow also dyed well. Green and blue did not dye so well

I made these eggs for a girls pageant reception at my church. The color scheme was purple and gold so I made bright yellow (15 halves) and dark purple 15 halves they were a real big hit no one had ever tried this before not to mention they did taste great.!!! I am making again today for our granddaughter's baby shower she is having a boy the colors are Red, Blue and Yellow . Awesome I love this project.!

Turned out great!  I used neon colours food colouring.  The yellow didn't turn out that great, But the blue, purple and pink were awesome.  Lots of fun for kids to make too.

I couldn't get my eggs as dark - it didn't really say how long to leave them in the colored water or if the water should be hot or cold.

I always have to make deviled eggs for Easter because my husband loves them. This really kicked it up a notch. The multi-colors were a big hit. Coloring the whites of the eggs was easy . I used my regular recipe for the yolks and it turned an ordinary appetizer into a beautiful and delicious one that everyone commented on. Will definitely make them again.

SEE A WARNING AT THE END OF MY POST!  Recipe is really simple including the directions for boiling the eggs. I didn't have any problem peeling off the shells except for one. I added some chopped capers as well as some of the caper brine. If doing this, put the capers and brine in first and taste before adding salt. I also added a little extra mayo and mustard to make sure I had plenty of filling as I have a heavy hand filling the eggs. Enjoy!!   WARNING...when using a pastry bag to pipe in the filling, make sure your yolks and any add'l added items are cut fine otherwise it may cause a block in your piping tip and possibly create a mess. I had an unmashed yolk causing me problems.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  I used the neon food coloring so the colors were vibrant.  Thanks for the recipe and yes, I will be using it again!

I use regular yellow mustard and a teaspoon or so of cider viniger in my egg yolks for the filling, but other wise these eggs are so beautiful, everyone says too pretty to eat haha. I also lay to slivers of fresh chives from my garden on each egg.

It was great! I substitute the miracle whip (since it has high fructose corn syrup) to Hellman mayonnaise, and added pickle juice, sprinkle white sugar and parsley. My son enjoyed coloring the eggs! Yum Yum Yum,

I took these for an Easter potluck yesterday abd they were all gobbled up before I could even get any so I guess that equals 5 stars right?! Thanks for the adorable and yummy Easter treat
