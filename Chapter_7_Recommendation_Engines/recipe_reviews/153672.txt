So many of my favorite veggies & nutrient super stars are in this soup! I figured it would be tasty. However, the sodium content is alarming: over 1,100 miligrams per serving!!! Not cool! So I altered the cooking method to bring out more flavor sans sodium. I used frozen turnips with greens & added celery. I sauted onion, celery, carrots, and a bay leaf in a tsp of oil. Then added the other veggies and about 3 Tbls of roughly chopped garlic. Sauted a about 10 min. Then added 12 cups of water and 4 Tbls of Better than Boullion (which brought the sodium to over 2,400 miligrams for the whole pot, or 240 per serving). I cooked the barley on the side to save time and skipped the flour/butter to save calories and because I prefer a brothy soup. Hearty, filling, and, with a few modifications, healthy!

Thank you!  Amazing soup!  I made it today and my husband and I are eating it up with a loaf of Olive Bread!
I changed one thing-  I added about 6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped for a boost!  We love garlic!   The soup is a dream!  I cant wait to make it for my family one day.  Deeeeliciousness!  Im a huge fan of Brussel Sprouts and they are in season RIGHT NOW!  Thank you so much!  YUMMINESS!

Hmm, so this is a LOT of soup.  I made a half batch and we had it for dinner last night and are having it for dinner tonight.  And we will STILL have lots of it leftover.  So . . .just an FYI.  If you want to try a little, perhaps you would want to quarter it.  It's not bad, actually, and certainly full of veggies, which is what we're going for right now. But I have to say that I don't really like brussel sprouts, and this soup isn't going to change my mind about that.  Happily, they are easy to pick out if you decide you don't like them but have someone else in the house who does like them (bf) and they don't make the soup taste like cabbage or anything (I don't like cabbage, so that would be a downer for me).  I made this in the crock pot, and it was done after 4 hours on high, which is exciting bc you could probably let this cook on low while you are at work all day.  (Well, that's exciting to me anyway).  It didn't really thicken up much with the crockpot, though, so keep that in mind if you like thick soups--if you do, you are better off sticking to the recipe.  All in all, a nice fall/winter soup chock full of veggies and easily adjusted to taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this and it is terrific.  I did add about 6 cloves of garlic with the first batch of veg.  At the end I stirred in about a tsp or so of smoked paprika, a squirt of fresh lemon juice and some parsley.  Excellent soup.

What a wonderful soup! So fresh and it had a wonderful flavor. I have tried a lot of soups from this site and this one was very impressive and one I will make over and over again. I do think the flour/butter ratio is a bit off so you might want to use less flour or add more butter. Excellent soup! Thank you for the great recipe.

Good soup, very fresh and cabbagy.  If I make it again, I will at least double the amount of barley, and may add bacon at the start to make this a heartier, more filling supper soup.

Great recipe, but needs a little extra flavor.  I added some garlic powder and extra cracked black pepper.  Next time I will probably add fresh garlic and an onion as well.

This is an excellent fall soup and one that used up all the vegies in the garden.  I too switched kale for barley and added fresh chopped garlic.  YUM-O!!!

had a few brussel sprouts to use up and wanted to make a grainy soup this was perfect, I 1/2'd it and didn't add any salt with the salted butter. Also had a few mung beans leftover thru those in at the end for some chew!!

Great soup! I used frozen mixed vegetables in place of the turnips, carrots, and green beans because I didn't have time to run to the store. I replaced some of the salt with salt-free herb seasoning to reduce the sodium a bit, too.

I made this in my electric pressure cooker and it was great! did not have a leek so I sauteed an onion, garlic and ginger before adding brussel sprouts and green beans, barley and red pepper. I only used 8 cups of broth, but kept everything else the same except no carrots and more beans. the auto menu on the pressure cooker is 30 minutes for soup. I let stream release slowly while fixing the butter and flour. once I could open the link I just started in the thickener and served. great soup.

I did change this a little. But, too little to comment. Really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts. I used turkey bone broth I made after Christmas. I will definitely make again.

I agree that it needed a little bit more seasoning. I substituted an onion for the leeks and used less broth. I liked the creamy consistency after adding the flour mixture. I would make this again.

It’s an easy recipe and I love the vegetables but it seems flat. It needs something but I haven’t been able to figure out what that something is. I feel like it needs a herb or a spice or something.

Terrific soup for this veggie lover.   I love the combination of barley, sprouts and turnips.  Had no green beans, but don't think they were necessary.  Added minced garlic.  Added a small amount of diced up cooked bacon which I keep in the freezer to add flavor to soup and veggie dishes.  Thank you for this recipe.

The flavors of the different vegetables complemented each other. The barley gave it a hearty body. A vegetable-lover's dream.
