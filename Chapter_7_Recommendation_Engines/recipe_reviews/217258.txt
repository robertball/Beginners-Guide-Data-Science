I normally do not take the time to rate recipes, I should I guess, but anyhow....ths is fantastic!!  I add greek olives to my salad mix.  I added more mayo to the dressing, I like it a little thicker.  And the Naan bread is a MUST!  Warm the bread in the oven at 400 for 3 mins....Devine!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I felt the mayo made it too heavy.  Remade using 3 T of plain nonfat yogurt and only 1 T of lite mayo.  Very nice, light, refreshing dressing.  One lemon gave me the 2t of zest and juice (just fyi) was about 2 1/2 T.

Very, very good.  A little tangy from the lemon and vinegar so I added a bit of honey but otherwise a hit with everyone!
