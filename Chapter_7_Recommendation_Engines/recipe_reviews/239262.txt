After living in the islands, I am always on the look out for good recipes that utilize some of my favorite tropical fruits. This turned out good but I would like a more pronounced mango flavor. I did NOT frost this cuz I wanted to serve this for a brunch quick bread and not a dessert. Guests ate it up without complaint. Thanks for sharing.
