This was an OK potato dish, but there are several things that I would change.  I used an 8-oz pkg of cremini mushrooms, and that was more than enough for 1 pound of potatoes.  I thought the halved mushrooms were too big, so I'd quarter them in the future.  Also, rosemary is a strong herb, and it just dominated, so I'd cut it back to 1/2 tsp.   The overcooked chopped onions were almost unrecognizable after being cooked at 450 degrees, and I would have liked to bite into a piece of onion.  So I'll either cut the onion into larger pieces, or add them later in the cooking process.  Nice blend of herb-honey flavor,  easy to put together, and quick to come out of the oven.  I will try this recipe again with the changes noted above.  Thanks, Rebecca, for the new potato-mushroom dish.

It was a good side dish but an interesting mix of flavors. The herbed potato flavor is right up front and just as you start thinking, mmm love my herb potatoes you get hit with the honey sweetness. It is probably not for everyone but my husband and I really enjoyed these.

This was a good mix of the potatoes and mushrooms,the flavor of the mushrooms seeped into the potatoes,which we really liked.I cut it back,as there are only two of us,and i did not put the dry mustard in,as i had none.I added garlic,and sprinkled all with paprika.The cooking time was longer then stated,all in all,pretty good.

I really wanted to like this more than we did.  I love all the flavors involved but it fell flat.  I increased the initial bake time for the potatoes to 15-20 mins, then stirred in the remaining ingredients and baked according to the directions.  I wish I would have given everything a quick stir after 10 mins to keep the honey from sitting in one place to long.

I would definitely add additional baking time cause some of the potatoes were hard.  Cut mushrooms to half of the said amount, and cut back on the rosemary too!  I will try again with these changes, maybe a spice with a spicy kick too?!?!
