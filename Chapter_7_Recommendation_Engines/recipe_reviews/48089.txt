This should be in the main dish category, too.  I prepared recipe as written but grilled the cutlets a little longer than stated.  Use your judgement depending on thickness of chicken.  I did not serve as sandwiches but, rather, with a cold tortellini salad.  It was prepared earlier in the day and eaten for a quick supper on an evening when each of us had to be somewhere else after dinnertime.  It was tasty, and satisfying without being too filling.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone raved about it.  It is a great finger food.  Good for picnics too.  Thank you!

The sandwiches had a wonderful flavor. I slightly pounded my chicken and was only able to marinate for 2 hours. I had to broil them since it is winter here. They came out pretty good but cooking on a grill would add even more flavor. Toasted my rolls under the broiler.Very tastey.Thanks Tyson!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  He took some of the leftovers to lunch the day after making these sandwhiches and said they were even better the next day.
