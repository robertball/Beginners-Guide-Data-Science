This was good!  I made it a bit easier by using steam in the bag frozen veggies (I used a "CA blend" w/cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli).  Since my version had the added green broccoli, I skipped the green beans.   I used a combo of shredded Mexican cheese and white cheddar needing to be used.  At the end of the bake time, I broiled for a few minutes to brown the cheese on top.  THANKS for the recipe!

I had set my mind to make this and then realized I didn’t have any milk.  I used tomatillo sauce with water for the liquid, added sour cream for the creamy texture.  I always cook with extra garlic and cheese.  I also used ritz crackers to top it off.  I appreciate the flexibility of all the recipes on here and gives me just enough inspiration to do something original with our vegetables!  Thank you!

I made it, very easy to put together and it Turned out great!   I added crumpled corn Chex with drizzled butter to the cheddar cheese topping. This recipe is so easy, and a great way to spice up steamed vegetables

As is the recipe does not call for enough milk to cover the vegetables. So I had to up the milk and the flour. I used jarred peas and green beans. Everything else was fresh.  All in all it turned out pretty well. 
A simple recipe that can be tweaked to what is leftover in the house.

Delicious vegetable dish for a special occasion.  Cream sauce has substance and is not too rich.  Perfect combination of ingredients.  Everyone loved it!

I wasn't happy with this dish.  Others might like it. I am definitely a vegetable lover, but I won't be doing this recipe again.

I prepared the casserole for a dinner for eight. It was delicious. The men commented on how much they liked it. I plan to serve it at Thanksgiving.

This was very good. I too used the steam in bag CA mix (super Easy)   I omitted the green pepper and beans.  I served this with salad and soup for a nice weeknight meatless meal. Yummy.
