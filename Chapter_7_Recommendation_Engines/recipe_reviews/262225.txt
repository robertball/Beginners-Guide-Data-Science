I'm new to cooking so I follow recipes exactly.  2 tablespoons of salt!!!  I had my doubts when i read that so I looked to the reviews and none of them mentioned it.  So I followed the recipe and ruined two racks.  Everyone else must've been smart enough to realize the typo and only used 2 teaspoons.  Other than that they probably would've been good.

I  used the recipe for the cook times for ribs my instapot.
Ill put whatever seasoning to my choosing on the ribs. If its a marinade I'll let it sit for about 30 min to marinate. If its a dry rub I may let it sit, I may not. Depending on my time limit. My family, nor myself are picky. Honestly, sometimes I just put 1/2C water and 1T liquid smoke in the instant put and rub the ribs in salt and cook it that way to taste the meat flavor itself.  ANYWAY I don't even put these ribs in the oven, as it is more work and more dishes for me. And I don't like my ribs to completely fall off the bone. I like my ribs to have a little bit of pull from the bone. Feeling like I get back to my true cavewoman roots. haha. Great recipe though as a base, and I'm sure following the full thing is great as well. I have favorited it for sure and use it often! Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly.  These are the most delicious ribs I have ever made or eaten.  I used Baby Ray's original barbeque sauce.  

In response to another reviewer here, be sure to use kosher salt, not table salt.  They are not the same.  Kosher salt is inexpensive.  I picked up a huge box for $1.50.  It's good for seasoning other meats also.

This is an excellent recipe. We have made it 3 times, twice for company.  I did cut back the salt to one tablespoon and the cayenne too. Using 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and 1/4 teaspoon chipotle. This gives it a hint of heat.  Also, we used smoked paprika.

These came out great! I did cheat and use a pre-made rub (Weber Smoky Brown Sugar rub).  I did everything else to the letter and it was amazing. My husband usually puts these in a smoker or on the grill in foil. It takes forever. He's sad now because I'll never let him bbq ribs again after this fantastic recipe.
Update: I made these a second time because my son showed up to visit on a night that I didn't plan to make dinner. I had ribs in the freezer so I seasoned them in the frozen state, popped them into the instant pot and added 20 minutes to the cooking time. They came out just as fabulous as the first time from the fresh state.

VERY TASTY!  i love the easy fast cooking of the insta pot, and these ribs were so tender! just the right amount of seasoning,, savory and yet they didn't fall to pieces as you lifted them from the pot. but they were way folk-tender!, i woud cut theh cayenne pepper ( i added only half ) because it was a little too spicy for me... yes I am a wimp!! but the flavor is absolutely  wonderful!  thankx for  great recipe to use in my insta pot!

The cardinal rule of cooking meat in the Instant Pot is to do a Natural Release of the pressure for 15 minutes or the meat will be tough.  It is not necessary to heat the oven to 425*.  Simply place the ribs under the broiler for a few minutes (3-5) to brown and caramelize the sauce.

Made these per recipe. They came out just about perfect, not “falling off the bone” but peeling off the bone clean with each bite. This is the first time doing ribs in the my new IP. Almost seems sacrilegious but I don’t care. I’ll take these ribs in 30 min anytime! Something stuck out a bit with the seasoning, either the chili powder or paprika so maybe I’ll adjust next time. I covered it with Sweet Baby Ray’s Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce. Can’t wait to try it again!

I put two racks of ribs in at one time and finished on the grill instead of the oven.
Delicious and easy. Glad I made a double recipe, we were fighting over the last one.

The process is spot on. I used Alton Brown's rub and braising liquid recipes while following these cooking instructions. I then switched the pot to saute and boiled down the cooking liquid until it reduced by a little more than half, into a very syrupy glaze. Strained that off and brushed onto the cooked ribs. Yum!

Excellent recipe, only deviation was we used half the salt and used sea salt. So tender, fall off the bone, and the flavoring is spot on. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Cut cayenne by half.  Best ribs I have made.  I don’t like cooking twice - first in instant pot, then oven.  However it was worth it.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and while I like the dry rub and might keep that part of the recipe, the ribs themselves turned out nearly inedible. They were some of the toughest ribs I've ever made. Do not recommend.

*Changed yield to 2 servings and worked from that ingredient list

* Halved rub ingredients for the "hot" spices (paprika, cayenne, chili powder) as my other meal eater was a 4 year old

* Used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce in the 'Original' flavor



Other than the notation above, made recipe according to directions for my servings. Yes, even the salt. Perfect. I could pull the meat off of the bones, the taste was not too strong in any direction, and even the 4 year old approved. In the way that 4 year olds approve, that they eat 3 bites and say they are good and smile at the taste but then spend the rest of the meal eating the baked beans. ?? But *I* really liked it and am adding to my 'very little drama involved' recipe list. 

I paired with roasted broccoli (since the oven was already at 425 anyway) and baked beans.

Excellent fork tender ribs that were a huge hit with kids and hubby. Love the dry rub and simple cooking method. I will definitely be using this recipe any time I make spare ribs.

I cooked my  ribs for 22 minutes in the IP and then finished them for 7 minutes on the grill. They were great and had just the right amount of "pull" from the bone. I increased the cayenne to 1 tbsp cuz we like the heat. Will make again.

I made these ribs for dinner tonight.  I cooked them for 20 minutes so that the meat wouldn’t completely fall off the bone. I baked them on each side for 7 minutes  then broiled the top so the bbq sauce can caramelize. They were very delicious.

The only change I made was adding 1 tbsp of chicken broth powder and baked for 7 minutes only, so not to dry out the ribs.

Very good! I used half the salt and that was plenty. Also cooked 40 minutes in my pressure cooker and let it release naturally. Then 3-4 minutes on each side in the oven. They were fall off the bone good!!

Wow! I wish I had made 2 racks! I cut the salt down and didn’t realize until I was putting it away, that I used smoked paprika! I would probably cut the cayenne a bit next time, but hubs liked it so it stays! I also just broiled each side for a few minutes to caramelize my bbq sauce! I usually do the slow cooker, then broil method on busy days, but this is a nice alternative when I have some time! Will be using this rub on other meat! Thanks!

If I could give this 100 stars I would!! They were the best ribs we've ever had along with the easiest recipe! The meat fell off the bones and melted in your mouth! I absolutely LOVE my InstantPot... this was the first thing I tried and it encouraged me to try other InstantPot recipes. Thank you so much for sharing!

It was wonderful! My husband ate the whole thing and was sad because there wasn’t more. I reduced the salt in the recipe because I had read some of the reviews. Next time I will try as is. It needed a little more salt.

Big success!  Cooked for 8 people New Years Day and everyone loved them.  Made 2 batches, 2 racks of baby back ribs at a time.  What was left over on New Years Day were eaten the next day and they said they were even better the 2nd day than the 1st day.  This is definitely a recipe I will be making a lot.  Quick, easy and very tasty.  Quality BBQ restaurant taste and a lot cheaper.  I rubbed olive oil on the ribs, mixed all of the spices together and rubbed the spices on both sides of the ribs before cooking.

Omg this was amazing perfect bbq ribs in record time. I’ll never spend all day at the smoker again. We used Sweet Baby Ray’s regular sauce to finish it off and it was perfect.

This is the reason every person should have an instant pot. To save time, I just use a good, pre-packaged dry rub and a really good bbq sauce.

I cut all of the ingredients for the rub in half for one rack of ribs and had PLENTY. Turned out delicious! I was reminded too late to remove the membrane from the ribs -- next time! I will definitely use this recipe again, with modifications.

Great ribs!  Quick and very little clean up.   I doubled the recipe.  I have an 8 quart insta pot.  This is a keeper.

adjusted the salt should read 2 teaspoons most probably. Used the trivet in the IP to keep the ribs out of the liquid. Used it to lift them out. Only used 3/4 cup water was still plenty of liquid. Put the ribs under the broiler for 2 minutes after baking so they had more substance & texture like you get when you order out. Used store bought barby sauce from store to baste them prior to the baking part. Imagine you could put on the grill for a bit also.

The ribs turned out great, but the spices were a little overwhelming. I'll probably cut them in half next time. I'll definitely be making again. So easy.

I was disappointed by using the instant pot.  Next time I will use the pot but on slow cooker.  Company loved them, ate a full two racks of ribs.  The rub was delicious, will be using this again.  Texture was not to my liking, but family says I am picky.

These are absolutely amazing.  I used 1 tbsp of salt and a few dashes of chili powder.  I left out the cayenne pepper because I didn't want the kids faces to burn off. Delicious!!!!

This recipe worked really well.  The meat was really tender and probably could have been eaten straight out of the Instant Pot with sauce on the side, without the basting and extra step in the oven.   I didn't have chili powder for the rub,  so I added a little cumin.  After reading the reviews, I cut the amount of salt in half, but I think this was a mistake.  I used coarse Kosher salt, and the meat wasn't salty enough for my taste, so I think the original amount would be better.  The only thing I found confusing was the placement of the meat in the pot.  I could not get the pieces to stand up in tee-pee fashion, and I didn't think I should be laying them down in the beef broth, which might have washed off some of the rub.  So I used the rack that came with my Instant Pot and cooked them over the broth.  They still were hard to place but at least were not swimming in broth.   (It might be that ribs cooked in the broth would be saltier because of the saltiness of the broth.)  I was concerned about the cooking time, because my pot instructions indicated 40 minutes for the amount of meat (2 lbs.), but they were very tender.

I used 2 teaspoons of smoked salt instead of the 2T kosher salt.  Instead of cayenne pepper, we drizzled them with some local hot sauce we love.  I also sauted some onions in the pot first and then just added a can of consomme for the beef broth. I also used Swerve brown sugar. Let them natural release, and then covered with Baby Rays and broiled for several minutes.  They were so tender and the bones were absolutely clean!  There was no need to remove the silver skin, as it had cooked away.  I will definitely make again and will make two racks!  The seasoning is enough for two.

Perfect! The ribs were moist and tender. I made two slight deviation s from the recipe. I had no cayenne pepper so I used about a 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and Iused smoked paprika instead of regular paprika in the spice mixture for the rib rub. Best ribs I believe that I have ever made.

I did make changes to the recipe, I just removed the film off of the back of the ribs and wrapped the whole rack around the inside standing on it's side on the rack and I did not have a small can of beef broth so instead I used one cup of chicken broth and it came out fantastic.  2 hrs and 10 minutes compared to 6 to 8 hour in the oven or on the grill. Winner winner !!!!

I usually like to cook my ribs in a smoker and its a 4-6 hour process. Theres also a lot of clean up to do because of the oil dripping into the pan. But this recipe makes it so easy to have somewhat authentic smoked baby back ribs in one-fourth the time. The one pot clean up is an added bonus.  I removed the fell and used about 2/3 of the rub, letting it sit for about one hour before putting in the IP. Cooked on high for 30 minutes, then finished in the oven according to the recipe. It came out very good. The meat had a nice, tender chew and it was very flavorful.

Followed the recipe pretty closely and turned out great.
tested them on the wife and she really loved them. i shouldn't have told her how easy it is to make, though.
next time i'll probably use my own rub and sauce mixtures, but the process seems pretty solid. for 1.25 pounds of ribs 25 minutes was plenty of time.

We're not typically big fans of spicy food, or of a strong beefy taste, so I was concerned at the amount of black pepper and cayenne pepper the recipe called for, as well as using beef broth instead of chicken or vegetable broth. However, after following the recipe exactly, using my 6-qt Instant Pot, all I can say is wow!! Great taste, fall-off-the-bone tender. Don't change a thing!

I don’t really eat ribs, but my daughter and husband are rib fanatics.  I got a pressure cooker for Christmas and decided to give this a try as a surprise before my daughter left to go back to college.  
They said it was absolutely fantastic...restaurant quality!! We used sweet baby rays for the bbq sauce.

This was my first time using my new instapot. This recipe was so easy and the ribs came out so good. The only things that I did differently was I removed the membrane on the back of the ribs, cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon , and broiled the ribs on each side for a few minutes after the BBQ sauce rather than baking them. I will definitely be making these again.

Amazing!!!  Best ribs I’ve ever eaten.  Meat fell off the bone. Will only make ribs in pressure cooker from now on. Didn’t want it to be too spicy  so used 1/3 of the cayenne and 1/2 the pepper and 1/2 the chili powder. I added coriander to make up the difference which I could really taste. Couldn’t teepee so propped the ribs up on the side of the pot. Used Neeley’s BBQ sauce - 1/3 of the recipe was plenty. I reduced the pepper by half and still had a nice kick. Increased the brown sugar x4.

Delicious! Reduced the salt by 1 tablespoon, used smoked paprika, 3 teaspoons of garlic powder, used turkey broth as I had it on hand. Assembled as directed. Instead of cutting the ribs up, I wrapped it around with the meat facing outward. I mean, why deal with raw meat more than necessary? Cooked as directed. Used Sweet Baby Ray’s Hickory and Brown sugar BBQ. The cayenne might be a little too spicy for some. But for me, it’s PERFECT! I enjoy the mild lip and tongue burning. Great flavor. Overall, exceedingly easy to make. Absolutely making these again! Yum!

It was so easy to make these ribs they came out moist and tender. The best part is that they are so easy to make.  I changed it up a bit and omitted the sugar as there is always so much in the BBQ sauce.
They are a hit with the family so will make again.

I used 6 boneless spareribs and cooked them using the same recipe and cooked them for 35 minutes in the instant pot and used Kansas City Bar-B-Que sauce when I put them in the oven to cook after the We didn't care for the taste of the rub i will cook them plain next time.

I cooked it the suggested time,  with a much slower release b/c I was busy. The ribs were so well cooked,  the membrane was pulling back from the inside of the bones! They were very tender, and not dry, even after a few extra minutes in the oven lol. We ate them with forks.

Four stars only because I used preseasoned ribs, and turkey broth instead of beef. Despite these alterations, the cooking method was perfect. Delicious quick weeknight meal!

Absolutely spot on for cook time and liquid amount, the ribs were absolutely unbelievable. My husband refused to believe it took so little effort.

They're REALLY spicy, I like a lot of salt so I can't comment on that but the spice level was personally too much for me. I would probably halve the spicy ingredients personally but I don't love a high level of spice.

I had a TON of leftover spice rub, for me the proportions were pretty high compared to a single rack of ribs. I would suggest cutting the amounts you choose to use overall in half. You can always make more, but you can't make less. I packed every millimeter of surface with the rub and still barely used half of what I mixed up per the instructions and I hated the waste.

Definite winner in our house. A touch lower on the spice and I can see this being a weekly dish.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the method of cooking was excellent, however, my husband and I could not eat more than a small portion due to how spicy these ribs were. I would follow the general directions and change the spice to what we are used to, rather bland I must say, more of a meat taste for us.

Easy and flavorful! I substituted 1/2 a teaspoon of chili flakes for the chili powder and it was mildly spicy. The meat was tender and just falling off the bone enough, and firm enough that  that it doesn’t fall apart when trying to pick up the meat with tongs. Perfect tenderness for my family’s preference.

This was the first time I have ever tried making ribs. I followed the recipe as written. The ribs were perfect. The rack did not fall apart when I transferred it to the baking pan to finish cooking. When they were done baking the meat fell off the bone. This is a recipe I will be happy to make for friends and family.

When we need to make ribs in a hurry, this will be our go to recipe! Very easy to make for a new instant pot user. Ribs were very tender, maybe slightly too tender. While we prefer the meat to fall off the bone, we also like a slight tug with the meat. Maybe reduce the cook time in the IP a little if we make this again. Flavors of the rub and finished in the oven with bbq sauce (I used Stubb's original) was very good and again, we'll use this recipe if we're short on time to cook them low and slow in the oven/grill. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
