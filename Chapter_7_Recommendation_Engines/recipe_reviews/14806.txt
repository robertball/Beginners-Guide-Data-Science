Are the measurements correct as given?  I even added an extra egg and there was no "custard" to speak of.  Finished dish was much like a brick of cheese with peppers on the bottom.  Tasty, but not worth the trouble, since I can buy hot pepper cheese. Would love to make this and have it turn out custardy.  Let me know if recipe is correct.  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious.  ALL of my guests loved it.  I will say that I doubled the recipe, but only used about 4 cups of cheese total.  I also ended up using about 5 jalapenos, sliced into rounds.  The taste was still the same.  A great appetizer/snack for any time of year.

I've made this three times, and have enjoyed it every time.  I always serve it warm though, like a quiche without the crust.  I'd suggest experimenting with the proportions a little- we like a lot of cheese and prefer some extra spice.

It's good reheated, too.

My family really enjoyed it.  I think it is more suited for breakfast or brunch than a dinner appetizer. I used 5 Jalapenos seeds and all.  I also spiced it up with Frank's Red Hot and some Lowery's.  I will make it again.

I love love love this.
I use more jalapenos--pickled to be honest.
Good hot, good cold, even good the next day! Even my pre-schooler will eat it!

I used 5 jalapenos and this was NOT spicy. Next time I will not seed them or maybe even use a habanero instead. Freezes well, by the way!

I needed breakfast for hubby in a Hurry, this saved my morning! SO Good! He Loved it! I had a 1/2 pkg of fresh Mexican cheese, dried onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, all went in a pie pan and baked up to golden perfection. I used both Hatch chillies & a chopped jalapeno. Most Excellent! Thanks Smatterchu. :):)
