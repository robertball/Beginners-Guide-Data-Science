THESE ARE NOT WHOLE EGGS!! Separate the eggs, and whip only the whites. I know it doesn't say to, but just do it. Whole eggs won't whip properly, and you won't get it to set up the way you want it to. That said, this is a fantastic recipe. Couldn't be tastier. Just don't waste eggs by trying to whip them whole.

Mousse turned out as pictured! So I noticed some weren't getting the texture for the mousse in the picture so I will give some tips on how to achieve this. Ingredients are exact as recipe calls for, which means you use the WHOLE egg not just the whites like other reviewers have said. It is also unnecessary to cook your chocolate over the stove.
So first you must put a metal bowl with metal mixer blades in freezer for 30 min before hand. Take out and add cream, mix with hand mixer on high for 7 mins while holding the bowl at an angle to let the cream get more air incorporated into it. You must use a mixer for this! Hand mixing with a whisk will not be fast enough. Next take another medium sized bowl and add all the eggs and sugar, Mix with hand mixer for 7 mins with the same weird angle as the cream to incorporate more air. The eggs will triple in size being fluffy and thick like the cream. 
put aside eggs once done. 
Take chocolate and put into a medium sized glass bowl, put in microwave for 15 seconds and ONLY 15 seconds! If you do this longer you will burn and ruin it all. Take out of microwave and add coffee, mix, then put back in microwave for another 15 seconds, take out and mix completely. It will be nice creamy and smooth. 

Then once this is done add eggs to chocolate mix completely with a spoon, then add cream and mix completely. Refrigerate for 2 hours in desired cup and then it comes out thick,and perfect like picture.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  The first time I made I skipped using the coffee - the coffee really adds to the flavor of the chololate so don't skip that step.  And be careful not to over whip the cream.  If it is too stiff your mousse will come out lumpy.

It was wonderful!  My hubby who is a mousse-snob wanted to eat it all.  My picky daughters enjoyed it too, which is surprising.  Of course, I made him share.  It was easy to make as well.  I will definitely make this for my family again.

I have a stand-by favorite chocolate mousse recipe I’ve been using for years (since it’s Hubs’ favorite dessert) but today I felt like trying something new.  I liked this recipe, however, for my own comfort I needed to make some modifications.  First, I did not add the coffee.  I didn’t feel the need to “enhance” the chocolate flavor, especially at the expense of risking having my good Scharffenberger chocolate seize on me.  Second, I knew I’d need this to be sweeter and lighter.  I separated the eggs, beating the egg yolks into the slightly cooled chocolate. I beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, adding a tablespoon of sugar (to one half recipe).  I folded those beaten egg whites gently into the chocolate mixture.  Finally, I sweetened the whipped cream as well, adding 2 T. of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla (again, the recipe scaled to four servings), then folded them in last.  This turned out just as I had hoped – smooth, rich, creamy and deliciously chocolate.  Since this was a special birthday dessert for Hubs (his request) I piped this into dark chocolate dessert shells, and served it surrounded by a homemade raspberry coulis.  I garnished it with fresh mint, a fanned strawberry and genuine gold leaf flakes.  Beautiful.  Hubs was quite pleased.  I’m rating this four rather than five stars, as I’m not so sure I would have been as happy with this had I followed the directions as written.

There was no hesitation in rating this recipe.  Everyone said 5 stars immediately.   This is a fabulous recipe with deep dark chocolate flavor.   The mixture does thicken quickly when you add the coffee so have all your additions ready to stir in.  This is a keeper!

I'm sure it would have been wonderful, if I did it right. I was mixing the eggs and whipped cream by hand, though, and after about a half-hour and some wrist-cramps, I thought "these eggs aren't getting any fluffier or thicker", so I figured that was as fluffy as it was supposed to be. I was wrong, and it ended up being too runny (tasted great, but mousse should be spooned, not sipped).

I had made a double recipe, and was concerned about wasting delicious ingredients. Fortunately I'm a problem solver and added some Trader Joe's wholegrain pancake mix, and baked it for 1/2 hour and made some pretty good brownies.

AMAZING! I am testing mousses for chocolate cordial cup fillings for a shower and I bought the Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate chips. I am sure the cacao is great too, but wanted a bit sweeter. I accidently put the coffee in with the chocolate before the egg and sugar were thick, but I just kept simmering and stirring the mix and it turned out fabulous! Thanks soooo much, will be using this recipe alot!

This tasted really good. Except I was a little dissapointed because mine never got really thick like the photo posted. That is why I had chosen this recipe. But, I could think of a ton of ways to serve this. Thanks.

This was fantastic.  I used the scaling function to reduce this to 2 servings and it was perfect for our Valentine's Day dessert.  I did add about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  as I was adding the whipped cream. It was great.

Great flavor but...not as firm as picture. Needed to fill cream puffs. To make extra firm: after doing final recipe steps. Dissolve in double broiler 1 packet unflavored gelatin softened in 1/4 c coffee. Add to final product with mixer on high speed for 2-3 min.Then refrigerate. If you have made a chiffon pie you will get it! Works like charm! This will give you firm more of a mousse-like texture instead of pudding!

This was fantastic!  Thick and dark chocolate taste...the whole family loved it.  I used espresso instead of coffee, which worked well.  I added chocolate gram-crust crumbles to bottom of of glass and topped with homemade whipped cream.  Delightful dessert!

This was really good!!! I had the same issue with bits of chocolate in my mousse but wasn't bothered by it. You are to use the 4 eggs whole, do not just use the whites like the one reviewer wrote. My thickened up just fine in the fridge.

A very easy mousse to make and very tasty and creamy. Not heavy at all or over chocolaty.  This is definitely going into the 'keeper' folder.

I am looking for a good mousse recipe to fill cupcakes before frosting.  I haven't tried this recipe yet so my 5 stars mean nothing but I wanted to ask if anyone has tried using this mousse to fill a cupcake or cake.  Any suggestions would be welcome.  Thank you!

I made this for easter dinner.  It was amazing, I did use Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate instead of the one in the recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I had no trouble whatsoever with it setting up.  Make sure you use the coffee in the chocolate, it enhances the flavor of the chocolate so much. I made this the night before and it tasted better after it had a chance to sit overnight.

This turned out great! I found it a little rich (and subsequently could not finish my bowl) but then again, it's mousse! If you like chocolate this is the dessert for you! 

A few things to note:

1) One person mentioned you have to separate the eggs - this is not true! Just put the eggs and the sugar in your stand mixer, put it on high, and walk away for 8-10 minutes! 

2) The recipe should say to use a double boiler to melt the chocolate. I found its wording unnecessary; this is a cooking website after all!

3) Be careful on how much coffee you put in. The coffee is meant to enhance the taste of the chocolate, you should not be tasting coffee!

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so easy to make! I also added a small dollop of whipped cream and grated a little chocolate on top. I finished with a strawberry slice and a mint sprig. Everyone was very impressed and there wasn't any leftover!

Turned out perfect! However; 1. Use whole eggs. I whipped for 20 minutes and they were perfect. 2. Make the cream and eggs first then set in fridge for 10-15 minutes 3. Microwave the chocolate for 15 sec, add the coffee, mix and microwave for another 15 seconds (There should still be a few chips solid, but they will melt as you stir. 3. Add the eggs to the chocolate immediately and mix (dont worry about mixing too thoroughly. Just get'em stirred together 4. Add the mixture to the cream and fold. 5. Enjoy! Mine was ready and perfect for serving right away.

Really delicious! I halved the recipe and it was plenty, 5 large cups of mousse. I also added graham cracker crumbs to the bottom of the glass, and then scooped the mousse on top. It did not get extremely hard, but it was so light, airy, and delicious, the best I have ever tasted. I whipped my egg whites with the sugar in one bowl, the cream in another, and the egg yolks in another. Then I folded everything together with the chocolate and coffee. Yum!

A 5 in taste! I only gave it a 4 because the coffee is difficult to add in, even if working quickly, without the chocolate clumping. The result was a delicious, rich mousse, but with chunks of chocolate it in. My guests enjoyed the chunks, so all was good. I would consider omitting the coffee because of the difficulty, but I think it would change the dimension it adds to the flavor.

This was a great, and very easy, recipe. Use the whole egg... I don't know why people insist on changing recipes before they try them. I only had semi-sweet bakers chocolate which ended up being a little sweet (but my husband and I are on the paleo diet so most things are sweet to us). I suspect that if I used the suggested bittersweet chocolate, it would have been perfect. -- semi sweet chocolate was excellent as well, I just might cut back on the sugar if I use semi-sweet again.  *** NOTE: Mine came out runny so I poured it into individual serving dishes and let them set up over night (I think 2 hours would have worked though). Once I got to it, it was the consistency of serious mousse and I am confident that I could pipe it at that point to make it look like the posted picture. It needs to set first!

adding hot coffee (or any water - even one drop) to melted chocolate "seizes" the chocolate which all instructions on melting chocolate warn strongly against.  Substitute cream instead & add some instant expresso powder for coffee flavour.  Otherwise, a tasty mousse.

This is so chocolaty and smooth. We all agree it deserves more than 5 stars! I served it with rasberries ans pirouette cookies. So easy to make and tastes like you slaved over it!! Will add this to my go to recipes.

This came out fantastic. Best to have a little bit of kitchen experience before making a mousse, but still an easy accomplishment.

We were a bit disappointed at how much you could taste the coffee, so it just didn't hit the spot for craving "real" chocolate mousse. If you want COFFEE flavored chocolate mousse, this is pretty good. Otherwise, try another recipe.

Needs more sweetness (which I added but not enough.) And if you're a real chocolate-lover and enjoy a chocolate overload then this is for you. I'll probably go semi-sweet next time. I didn't add the coffee my preference. I do admit with strawberries it wasn't half bad and the presentation was exceptional. I'll get this one worked out for us, because it would be worth the effort.

I had never made mousse before this recipe. This was very easy and delicious. I don't think think the Ghirardelli chips are really necessary, because it was just as good the second time around with semi-sweet chips. I also did hazelnut flavoured coffee the second time around, which I thought added nice depth.

Yum! Great recipe but I thought it was too bitter so on my second try I doubled the sugar. Hence the four instead of 5 stars. The chocolate gets hard FAST so have all of your ingredients ready and melt it in a BIG bowl so you can add it to the chocolate

The taste is great! However, the directions are vague. I was unsure of when or if I was to remove the chocolate from the heat when adding the other ingredients, the 10min. for whipping the eggs seemed unrealistic for my mixer (they were thick and fluffy after about 2min.) I did make one sub. though, I used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Squares instead of Chips. 
My family did enjoy it with home made whipped topping!

Despite all the great reviews, I was fearful of this -- I'm a terrible baker.  I tried it and it turned out perfectly!  Just be sure to whip the cream a long time, and then whip the eggs a long time, and it turns out really lovely.  Very easy and looks professional.  I brought it in martini glasses as the dessert to dinner at a friend's and everyone loved it!

This mousse is exactly what mousse should taste like and feel like in your mouth. It does take some practice to perfect though; like the chocolate bumps/balls/specks one can sometimes get and you must be patient. This stuff needs to set up in fridge and the longer you let it be the better it gets. Ive had three day old and its just way better than day 1 or 2 even. I doubt that I'll ever try it at 4 days!
Just keep trying and dont seperate the eggs. Making this again right now.

I made this for Valentine's day for my boyfriend and we both loved it. It was rich and creamy and thick how mousse should be. It was my first time making mousse but it turned out so great. I will be making it again. I also took advice from some other reviews and used only the egg white and not the whole egg like the recipe says.  Still awesome tasting and turned out perfect

This recipe came out by far the smoothest I've ever made. The one change I made, do to my family's preference, I mixed the dark chocolate to a mix of dark and semisweet. Using a ratio of 1/4 semi to dark. will use this recipe over and over again

Excellent chocolate mousse. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and only whipped the egg whites. After 10 minutes on high speed, these were nice and fluffy. The coffee really enhanced the flavour - by working quickly, I didn't have any issues incorporating it into the melted chocolate. Great consistency and taste overall, I'll be making this again.

Yummy x 10. I microwaved my chocolate at 50% power stirring every 30 seconds or so- this worked fine. Added freshly whipped cream dollop when serving. Whipped cream smooths out the strong coffee flavor a little- if you want to smooth it out.

This is one of my favorite desserts. I've made it a hand-full of times and it comes out perfect each and every time. It calls for four egg at room temperature, please be sure to separate it and not use the yolk. I tried making  it with the bitter-sweet, milk chocolate and semisweet chips and I like the semi-sweet the best.

Wow!  My Dad absolutely loves chocolate mousse, so I've tried quite a few recipes over the years. This is the simplest by far and the end result was decadent. I made a pie using one of those Chocolate crumb crusts, drizz;ed  w/ melted chocolate on top; it got rave reviews at our birthday get-together. (Fortunately there were two slices left for Dad to take home w/ him.) I did use the whole egg, not just the whites.  It does not whip up like just egg whites would, but it does get "fluffy and thick" as the recipe states.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, used a blend of 60% & semi-sweet Ghirardelli chips. Absolutely wonderful!  This is my new "Go To" mousse recipe.

I've made this several times without the coffee. Absolutely fabulous each time. I did whip the egg whites and the yolks separately as advised.  I think I'll add the coffee next time.

My family found that the bittersweet chocolate plus the coffee put the 'bitter' flavor too intense.  I'll try again with semi-sweet.  I did separate the eggs so as to 'meringue' the whites.  I found also that I over whipped the whipping cream and it really was too difficult to smooth out in the end product.

Delish!  Made for a party.  Served in chocolate bowls, with a raspberry sauce from White Chocolate Raspberry Mousse recipe(on this site) and fresh raspberries.  It was wonderful.  I substituted store brand 60% chocolate in this recipe and it was still wonderful.  In the raspberry sauce I used Chambord rather than orange liquor.

Made it with 1/8 coffee and 1/8 Grand Marnier and it tasted great. Make sure you beat the eggs for 10 mins (yes the whole eggs). I used my stand mixer. I did put my stainless steel bowl in the fridge for 30 mins before I whipped the cream and it whipped up really fast. Will be making this again today. I also made a white chocolate mousse and layered the two together and it was fantastic!

Delish! Remember to use egg whites not whole eggs of else the egg doesn't get that fluffy texture. For garnish some good options are mint leaves, raspberries, whipped cream, orange twists, orange zest, and fresh stevia leaves.

Turned out sooooo good ! I am not a dessert person by any means but this was pretty easy (despite a few choc. chips that didn't come smooth) and I am so proud of myself. This recipe makes a ton though so now I'm giving mousse away to friends and family. Delicious- you won't be disappointed!

I used to be a mousse purist and would only make mousse that used whipped egg whites (no whipped cream).  I like the addition of whipped cream, and the taste is amazing. HOWEVER, anyone who follows this recipe to a "t" will have a failure. Whoever wrote the recipe should be ashamed!  You have to separate the egg whites and whip just those.  As in some other recipes, I added the yolks to the chocolate (after tempering the yolks).  I hope they will correct the recipe so people don't get frustrated.

I was terrified, as I've never made this dish before. But I followed the instructions (as well as suggestions from others) and it was AMAZING! Beat the whole eggs for 10 MINUTES! NO cheating! and it will turn out great. I left out the coffee & added a teaspoon of Orange Flavor. Just to let you know, it makes a LOT of mousse

will have to try this again. I decided to try the recipe following all the steps carefully, I already think it's not going to come out as expected. I should have known not to whip eggs with yolk, never turned out fluffy. I think you should edit the recipe steps, it looks just like pudding.

I read the instructions 3 times before trying it. Never heard of whipping Whole eggs before, but Oh well, it has 4.5 Stars so it must need them. WRONG, what a waste.

I've made this 3 times in only a few weeks.  It is beyond good. I almost dread making it because I know I can't just have a small amount.  It never lasts more than 24 hours between my husband and I.  I can't even make it for a party because my husband won't let me leave the house with it.  It's fabulous.  Did everything as instructed.  The only ingredient I've changed is the chocolate.  First time I only had 70%.  It was awesome.  Second time, 70% with orange. Beautiful.  Third time 70% with coconut. Mmmm...  Next up on the list is chili chocolate.

THESE ARE WHOLE EGGS!!  I started out using the flat beater in my Kitchenaid with the eggs, turning the speed higher and higher.  Finally I remembered the wire whip, and used it the last 3 minutes on the highest speed.  I've whipped some eggs in my life, but I've never seen whole eggs get anywhere near that thick and fluffy.  It was amazing.
I didn't have the Ghirardelli chocolate at home, sadly, and had to substitute Hershey's special dark chocolate chips.  I know they're not as good, but it still turned out delicious.

Followed the recipes exactly. So delicious. The whole eggs must be at room temp and beaten for the full 10 minutes with a whip. They get fluffy/creamy. I’ll be using this recipe a lot.

This is a really good recipe. It’s very easy however, it does need time and patience. First of all the review were that says the eggs need to be separated is wrong. If your eggs are at room temperature and are beaten for a good 10 minutes they will create a light lemon colored fluffy better that will have peaks. I put a photo up above for those who want to see what it looks like. The same goes with the whip cream it takes a while, bowl, beaters and cream must be very cold.  Don’t be in a rush and try either of these mixtures on high speed, they will lose stability. Start your mixture on low speed.  You can increase the speed once they become foamy. I wouldn’t suggest doing this by hand we’re talking at least 10 minutes for each of these mixtures. Don’t try putting cold coffee into the melted chocolate or the mixture will have a seizure and it will be very difficult to continue incorporating the egg and cream. Mix the coffee in very quickly. Once the coffee is in very quickly add 1/3 of your egg batter and mix it in with the wire whisk. This is called sacrificing and will lighten your batter making it easier to mix the rest of the eggs and the whipped cream. I really enjoyed this but it is not for those in a rush.

Awesome recipe. I've made 4x now. All 4 have turned out well but this last one is a little on the edge. Crucial to SLOWLY pour coffee in while stirring fast. This last batch has a few chocolate chunks. Not a terribly technical recipe though and pretty fun to make. My family loves it!

Changes I made: 1. Halfed the recipe. 2. I followed the advice of others and whipped the whites separately from the yolks. I wasn't sure which should get the sugar, so I split the difference and sugared both. 3. I melted the chocolate in the microwave (:30 the first time, then two rounds of :15, stirring in between). 4. I didn't feel like making coffee, so I used some kahlua and heated it up in the microwave.  5. I paired the finished product with whipped cream, spiked with a little kahlua instead of vanilla. Overall really good recipe.

I only had Hersheys semi-sweet chips on hand, but that was the only change I made and it turned out delicious! Regarding what other reviewers have said about the eggs, I put all 4 whole eggs with the sugar in the kitchen aid with the whisk attachment and let it go on medium for about 10 minutes and the eggs were perfect. I also accidentally over-whipped my cream but it still turned out great! Probably a bit firmer than a traditional mousse but that's totally due to my "almost butter" whipped cream. Excellent recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for any chocolate lover. It will not dissappoint! However, it is tricky to make. Although I combined the ingredients using the method of the recipe the first time, I will not use the same method next time, as when you add the coffee to the warm chocolate, it instantly wants to breakup the chocolate and turns into a thick paste. Then also, when you add this warm paste to beaten eggs and cream, it deflates it makes it less fluffy. I was disappointed that it was not fluffy enough to pipe into my serving dishes like the picture. I then added 1/4 tsp of unflavored gelatin for fear it would not thicken and spooned into serving dishes. After chilling, the consistency and texture was great, and taste was fantastic, just not as professional looking as I would have liked. Next time I will : #1 make the coffee and cool it in the refrigerator, do not add it to the chocolate when it is melting. # 2 melt the chocolate with 1/4 cup of the cream, and allow it to come to room temperature. #3 whip the whole egg mixture for an entire 10 minutes, it will get light and fluffy, but you must use an electric mixer. #4 make the whip cream. #5 Combine everything, nothing should be hot as it will deflate the egg mixture and the whip cream. If needed whip mixture together for thickness. #6 Pipe into dishes and chill.  Note: If it is not thick enough to pipe at this point, I will add 1/4 tsp gelatin and chill it all in one dish, and then try to pipe to serving dishes after its

Experienced cook, first time making mousse. Went well. Made some slight changes after reading the reviews...Added 2T powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the cream before whipping, to sweeten. Only added 1/2 the coffee, since I don't drink it and don't really care for the flavor. Separated the eggs, and reserved the yolks to mix with the slightly cooled chocolate/coffee mixture. Yes, you do need to move quickly when adding the coffee! Wow! It all went together well. Tasted fantastic---not too sweet. If you want it sweet, you may want to add some more sugar to the cream before whipping. Will make again...would be impressive for a dinner party. Sure had lots of pots and pans to clean up!   :)

Outstanding, this is delicious! I made it as suggested by others by adding some vanilla and powdered sugar to the cream, otherwise as written. It was so good, I lucked the spatula and had a hard time stopping from eating it all right then!

I made this as directed and it turned out great.  Definitely time consuming but worth it.  Very fluffy and delicious.  I took advice form others and put the bowls and beaters in the freezer for a bit to keep them cold.  It definitely helps with making the cream.

This turned out wonderful! Light airy mousse and all my guests loved it. I took a chance and beat whole eggs together with sugar and they formed stuff peaks beautifully. I used Belgian Milk Chocolate instead of Ghirardelli's and it tastes heavenly. definitely making this again.

Second time making this recipe. It tastes fabulous and it is easy to make. One thing to note is for me it made 12 pudding size dishes two thirds full, so you know this if you need a smaller quantity you probably could half the recipe.  I top it with home made whip cream.

Yummy,  It was a big hit with my husband and son. I followed the directions, but made a big bowl and scooped into cups to serve. It was a little too rich for me, so I added whipped cream when serving.

Fabulously light and airy chocolate mousse! I followed the instructions as written and had no trouble although I had some stress because I miscalculated the size of bowl needed at the end and had to muck about switching to a bigger bowl right at the time when speed was of the essence. 8 servings are a bit much for me so will halve the recipe next time. Will definitely be making this again soon!

Anyways, the toughest part is knowing when the eggs are done. Turn the mixer to the highest setting and do something else for 10 minutes. When you return it should be the as thick as cooked pudding when you turn off the heat. I followed the instructions 100% and it set up in minutes.

This was very easy. I took another reviewer's advice and microwaved the chocolate chips for 15 seconds, stirred in the coffee and microwaved for another 15 seconds. I stirred it thoroughly, and it still seemed that some of the chocolate was still unmelted, so I microwaved it another 15 seconds and that was perfect. I did beat the eggs and sugar with an electric hand mixer for almost 10 minutes and it was beautifully frothy and creamy. Perfect consistency. I was afraid that it might be bitter, as I much prefer milk chocolate to dark chocolate, but it was lovely. A few raspberries on top made a wonderful dessert. Spooned into 1/2 cup custard dishes, it filled 8 to the rim with a little  left over.

I made no changes.  It really is easy and delicious.  You must have a mixer and when it says to beat the eggs and sugar for 10 minutes, do it.  The coffee doesn't have to be boiling hot but there is no trouble stirring it into the melted chocolate.  Just stir quickly and then immediately add the egg mixture.  Heavenly and divine and perfect for  a light dessert.  I will definitely make again

Mine turned out pretty good, but as a lot of people have mentioned I didn't include the yolks.  My dog enjoyed them, but they didn't have a place in the recipe.

I followed Obsieian's suggestions and this mousse turned out delish.  I did add 1t. vanilla and 2T. powdered sugar to the heavy cream, mixed to soft peaks with my kitchenaid and folded into the chocolate and egg mixture by 3rds.  Beautiful texture, light, creamy and this recipe was not intimidating at all.  Will be making this again for sure.

This was my first attempt at mousse. I followed all the instructions. It really does start to harden when the coffee is added (which surprised me). The coffee adds to the silky, rich flavour. I will definitely be making this again!!

This is an amazing chocolate mousse! It almost tastes like the one sold at Whole Foods. 

I did use WHOLE eggs, and they will beat thick and frothy if you use the proper technique or have a handy stand-mixer. It took about 5-6 minutes on high. 

I used someone's advice and added the hot coffee to the chips before microwaving them. I gave it a good mix and only had to put them back in the microwave for about 15 more seconds. 

The end result was rich, thick and completely delicious. I made a hard chocolate shell, placed the mousse inside, and am planning on topping them off with homemade whipped cream and strawberries! 

Thank you for the wonderful recipe and I appreciate everyone's comments!

Don't expect the eggs to whip up like plain whites do. This recipe, like many other top notch mousse recipes uses whole eggs. They are supposed to beat until maybe just double or triple in size and are a light lemon color. The lift will come when the heavy cream is folded in. this has worked numerous times for me. One more thing: be careful when whipping the heavy cream. It goes from soft to stiff to overbeaten in seconds. If whipped too long the cream will not fold properly into the chocolate mixture, and the result will be lumpy, unappealing, and lack the smoothness that makes mousse so divine.

I didn't change one single thing and this turned out perfectly as a treat for my grown daughter's birthday!  It's sinfully creamy, and delicious!  I will make this again as it is very easy to make and was a complete hit!!!.  

I don't know what others were doing with the eggs that caused their mousse to fail but my eggs turned out perfectly after a timed 10 minutes of beating.   Everything beat,  mixed, stirred and folded as directed and not one problem arose.  Go figure!!

I followed this recipe and I would not change a thing. The only thing I should have done different is folding  the whip cream with the chocolate a little longer. I was afraid of losing the texture so I stopped. There were white pockets through out the mousse but that did not affect the taste.  It was amazing. I love it and would definitely do it again.

Deliciously light and fluffy. I used the whole egg and had no problem with my large mixer. Whipped up in about 10 minutes.  Recipe says it makes 8 servings, but I think 12 would be more more accurate. I would definitely make this again. Thank you.

Grazie mille! Delicious and perfect fluffy Chocolate mousse. But please don't use whole eggs, it will fail. Only use egg whites, and mix them very stiff with the sugar and a small pinch of Salt. The salt will help to get the egg whites very stiff. I made this also with sugar-free chocolate for my hubby, and I used a spoon of Xylitol to mix with the egg whites. Also this completely SUGAR FREE chocolate mousse was delicious and fluffy! Thank you for this recipe.

Didn't turn out - soup. Here's what went wrong, I think. I beat the eggs at med speed for 10 minutes with hand mixer and it didn't seem to be getting thick as described, so I ramped up the speed a notch for an extra minute. The egg mixture turned to foam just as I poured them into the chocolate mixture. Drat! Next time, I'll still use whole eggs but beat for 8 minutes on med  speed and see what happens.

Top Notch Mousse.  At the age of 8 I tried chocolate mousse for the first time, turned to my parents and said in astonishment "WHAT is in THIS?".  Good thing it took a good few years to discover how simple the recipe can be.  Made this about a dozen times now always with ghirardelli 60% bittersweet (there is no finer mid range chocolate).  Follow the directions -- whip until the cream has peaks (and then some), beat the eggs for a good while (about 3-4 minutes with a mixer does the trick), and finally don't skimp on the coffee.  I like to infuse some raspberry flavor now and then, preferably with in season berries or I've used a raspberry torte flavored coffee before too that got the flavor about 70% of the way there.  Served to about a dozen folks now and the next time I hear anytime less than stellar reflections on the taste would be the first

Excellent!  I topped it with fresh raspberries.  Made it exactly as directed.  I was worried when I added the coffee because it got lumpy/grainy.  However, I continued to whip it and it smoothed out.  Very easy and fast to make.

Excellent flavour. Made it as written, but it wasn't firm enough for my use, so I rewhipped and added gelatine. Turned out great!

You actually shouldn't separate the eggs. Whipping the whole egg with sugar for that length of time turns them into a lovely velvety ribbon that folds beautifully with the cream.

I made this according to the recipe as it was written. Delicious and a crowd pleaser but did not set up like I had hoped (although made an AMAZING frozen push pop). Will try to seperate the eggs like -laigaie suggested. We shall see how it goes.

This is the best mousse recipe! I made it for a party recently and everyone laughed when they saw how big the double batch was, but not a bite was leftover. I have never had a problem with it setting properly even though I don't separate the eggs, but I usually use a timer and whip the eggs for a solid 10 minutes on high. This is so delicious - make it and you won't regret it.

This is an amazing recipe! I thought it was going too be difficult like other chocolate mousse recipes i've tried in the past, but I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and result it produced. I will be using this a lot!

So delicious! I took this to a dinner party last night and it disappeared very quickly! I did separate the egg whites and whip them separately as another reviewer suggested. (I mixed in the yolks after the whites/sugar were stiff.) The mousse was firm and not too sweet... everyone said it was better than restaurant mousse! Will definitely make again.

YUM! I didn't have Ghiardelli chocolate, but just used decent quality chocolate and this was excellent. Most mousses I've made call for cooking the egg yolks - which too often results in tiny bits of cooked eggs in the mousse (and yes, I do mix some of the chocolate mixture into the eggs before adding the eggs) so I loved the way this recipe used the entire egg, not just the yolks, and didn't cook them. My family enjoyed every last bite.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out to be a liquidy, lumpy mess! I thought if I put it in the fridge for a while it would start to solidify, but it never did. It didn't taste good either. Even my boyfriend (who will eat almost anything) said it tasted bad, and that's saying something. If you're in search of a tasty mousse recipe, keep looking.

Thanks to "Obsieian",  Jul.31, 2013 (I followed these directions word for word) it turned out fabulously well though I still had a few chunks of chocolate due to my microwave being less powerful.  I put a little Grand Marnier in cordial glasses, then mousse and topped with Real Whip.  I only needed 8 but it would have made about 16 this size.   Just enough after a big dinner.  Elegant and delicious!  Many compliments and requests for the recipe so I am sending the link to all my guests.

My addition to the recipe is a subtraction:  leave out the egg yolks.  Use only the whites.  It makes it a lighter dessert. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla - because I like vanilla.  Three or four drops of mint extract also works.
With these changes it is a five star recipe, IMO.

Superb! It does get a little dicey when you add the coffee to the melted chocolate. Do yourself a favor and have everything ready and in front of you when the coffee is added.
I've made this 6-7 times and it always comes out perfectly.

It was good, but the eggs never got fluffy and it tasted of very strong coffee, (i don't like coffee). I would recommend using sweeter chocolate and skipping on the coffee. Otherwise it was thick and wasn't lumpy like others have said. I would make this again.

Used as a frosting, so good. Light and airy and chocolatey! I put cupcakes in fridge to set well. Very nice and will do again instead of traditional frosting.

While this mousse was ok at best it was not worth the time or the premium ingredients that the recipe calls for. I made the recipe EXACTLY as written and it came out a runny mess that had an odd, almost "fake", flavor to it. I will not be making this again.
