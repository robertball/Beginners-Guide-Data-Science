i made this because we don't like corn tortillas and this uses flour tortillas. i used rotel tomatoes because did not have picante. i shredded my chicken instead of cubing. the flour tortillas got a bit soggy but i did change the picante to rotel. if i use rotel again i may cut the amount. these were quick, easy, satisfying and tasty. thanks for posting!

These are great for left over chicken.  I add hot salsa and chipotle peppers because we love spicy food.

We loved this recipe!  I changed it a bit by using Taco Seasoning (instead of the chili powder) and Taco Cheese and it was really great!!!  Use half mild picante for the kids and medium to hot for the adults.

I adapted this recipe slightly to suit what I had available and found it truly tasty with a tossed salad. I added boneless skinless chicken tenders (about 1.7 lbs) and 2 cans of Rotels tomatoes to my crock pot this morning and cooked all day on low. Followed the recipe exactly from there with great results!

Awesome and so easy. Boil chicken in 2-1/2 cups water with salt and pepper, to make broth. Then pair this dish with Spanish Rice made with the broth. (Using the broth instead of water, cook veggies for rice recipe. Then also add extra broth to Spanish Rice recipe and steam covered in oven while Picante Chicken Enchiladas bake.)

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making it again.  I used a rotisserie chicken that I shredded by hand, which made it even easier.  I served it with Mexican rice and a salad and it made a great meal.

Used rotisserie chicken from HEB (Italian Herbs) to reduce time. Mixed medium and hot picante sauce for a little kick. Good yet simple!!

My kids don't like these, but every adult I've ever made them for loves them. My in-laws like them so much that they ask for them every time they visit!

I used corn tortillas heated in a skillet to soften them for rolling.
Also cooked the chicken from frozen tenders in my electric pressure cooker with some garlic and chili powder. I have also used taco seasoning packet. I top mine with cheese before baking and cover with foil to keep from getting too brown.
