Fresh ginger is really the key to this dish so don't substitute if you can possibly avoid it.  You can buy a good size chunk of ginger, peel, dice and freeze in a mini ice-cube tray.  Then store in a ziplock bag for a recipe ready kitchen!

Note:  For the oil, use what you feel you need to keep the stir-fry moving. If you can do that on 2 tsps. total, great! I think the trick to using less oil is to get your pan just the right temperature. If the heat is too low the oil gets sucked up quickly. I never measure when I cook my tried and true recipes so estimating the amount of oil was difficult, I admit. I have switched to light olive oil in my kitchen for almost everything. Grapeseed oil would be best for this as it is really light and can tolerate higher heats without compromise. For those saying the recipe needs flavour - follow the recipe!!! I know powdered ginger doesn't give the flavour, hence I advise FRESH in the recipe and should be used to taste.

Yum!  This made a delicious, quick and easy lunch using some leftover pork chops.  I used the vegetables I had on hand, which included all the vegetables in the recipe, except for the celery.  In addition, I added some sweet peas and a scrambled egg.  Thanks sharing your delicious recipe, Carrie.

Thank you Carrie for a quick tasty dinner. I cooked extra pork chops when I made my pineapple pork dinner the night before and used them in this. I cheated and used grated ginger in a tube I'm so lazy anymore same with the garlic. Those were the only changes I made. I will make this again and again. PS Daughter took my leftovers and ran.

What a wonderful recipe to make with left-over pork chops! My cooking method may have been slightly different, and I added more pork, more light soy sauce, green peas, and eggs. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a wonderful recipe to suit your own family's taste.

This is excellent as written.  I never have any left over.  I have tried several fried rice recipes and to be honest----this is the BEST!  I wish I could give it 10 stars. I have made it with and without meat--it still is excellent!   The recipe is clear, concise and easy to follow.  We never buy fried rice out anymore.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. I doubled the amount of soy sauce. I also scrambled two eggs and mixed those in. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! This is the best pork fried rice I made, the only variation I made to this yummy dish is I used Chinese Bbq pork instead of "pork" and it made it taste more authentic. Thank you Carrie for this great and wonderful dish

I used it as a base recipe - I left out the celery.  Added some hoisin sauce and a dash of fish sauce.  Tasty!

I made this dish and added a few extra ingredients. I added 2 scrambled eggs at the end, 3 more Tablespoons of of Soy Sauce and some Vegetable Rice dry seasoning and fresh ground pepper. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used the dry powder version and more garlic to taste. It was yummy!!!

Quick and tasty.  This is a winner.  I made a dinnerr for two using 2 cups rice and two pork chops with bones removed and cut into ? inch cubes.  Canned mushrooms were used instead of fresh due to availability.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and will do this again.

Delicious and easy! I added some frozen peas, extra ginger, and maybe 2 tbs butter. Also 2 scrambled eggs before adding the rice. This tastes like take out! Also, if you're not worried about sodium, add extra soy sauce at the end or heavily salt your rice when cooking.

I had 2 cups cold rice left over and chicken rather than pork, and it was perfect in this recipe.  I only had an orange bell pepper, so the color was lost with all the diced carrots, but the flavor was still there. We had a Sweet and Spicy Thai Sauce that we used with it.  Also, paired this with 'Jan's Simple and Tasty Egg Rolls' from AR for a delightful meal.  Thanks Carrie, for sharing your recipe.  It hit the spot tonight.

I love to use leftovers in "new" dishes!! lol. I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy. I whole heaping tbsp of minced garlic (it's winter we need the immune system boost), leftover corn, and onions. It was so yummy. Definitely a keeper.

We enjoyed this fried rice. I halved the recipe and made the rice the day before so it was cooled properly. I had made a babequed pork tenderloin for wonton soup, I used the leftover meat for the rice. My family enjoyed, I added some Sambal Oleck to make spicier, served with wonton soup and eggrolls.

Actually this is the second time I’ve made this.  the first time without the mushrooms and this time with mushrooms But I don’t think the mushrooms contributed much to the taste.   Actually needs a little more soy sauce but I left it to the individual person to add to the  plate.    I did not have fresh ginger so I used powdered.  We had a pork roast dinner last night then tonight I cubed up 2 cups chopped of the leftovers   Both my husband and I thought it was an amazing meal

The fresh ginger really is the key ingredient. Sooooo good and easy to make. If I had one criticism, it would be it needed eggs in it.

I then added the pork, rice (2cups), andmushrooms on low heat for 3 minutes.l

This is the best pork fried rice I have ever made or eaten. I left the red peppers out because no one in my family likes it.  But, otherwise did not change a thing.

Loved this recipe, also had leftover chicken breast i thru in, some red bell pepper and 1/2 cup chopped cabbage.  I stir fried the rice with a bit of Habamare seasoning as I didn't have any ginger.  I added 3 TB Butter to fried rice and fried to dry out a bit... Also added two scrambled Cooke egg... My family ate it up!

This was very good and very easy.  I followed recipe exactly, except cut oil by about half.  I kept the soy on the table in case anyone wanted to add more to their own bowl.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really like this recipe! I omitted some of the vegetables and added more soy sauce. I don't think one tbsp is enough for all that rice. Thanks for the recipe! It was a great guide for making my own variation.

Yummy!  I used turkey breast - had some turkey breast cutlets in the freezer, but wanted something different, so I chopped them up and stir-fried it quickly.  Used brown rice, reduced sodium soy sauce but then added a Szechuan peppercorn/sea salt blend I had on hand, and drizzled with a teeny bit of toasted sesame oil towards the end.  I also probably went a bit heavy on the veggies, but that's the beauty of a recipe like this - use what you have on hand, and more or less to suit your taste.  Great recipe!

We enjoyed this! Also used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of just one. Added salt and pepper to taste. You really do need the ginger to make this recipe! Next time we will add in an egg or two. Will definitely make again!

I made this last night with my leftover pork roast. It was a big hit with my family and I will make it again. Listening to other reviews I added 3 Tbls of soy sauce, but I was worried that it might be too sharp or too salty so I added a tsp of brown sugar to the soy sauce before adding it to the recipe . I also added a tsp of sesame seed oil for flavor.  The vegetables (especially the celery) took longer than 3-4 minutes to soften, more like 15 minutes. Next time I will take that into consideration in the timing of the meal.

I made this and it turned out great. It was a big hit with my family. The only change I made was on the soy sauce. I added about an eighth cup of soy sauce.

This recipe worked out really well for my family.  Easy to follow and flexible to allow our use of what veggies we had on hand.  
Thanks!

Excellent way to use up pork chops. Made a few changes. Used fresh mushrooms. Added an egg. Also replaced the vegetable oil with sesame oil. Will make again. I was surprised at how well it turned out (that’s not because of the recipe but my cooking ability)

This is the best fried rice I’ve made.  Next time I’ll add some scrambled egg and bean sprouts, just because I thought it could use a bit more protein and I love  bean sprouts!

I made this as directed. My only cheat was picking up precooked rice from our local Asian shop and I found it was already oiled. I used 3 Tbsp soy sauce and make sure you use FRESH ginger!! ( I always keep fresh ginger in my freezer) Don’t overcook the veggies. Sprinkled it with a little black pepper. My husband loved it! Definitely would make again!

This was a great way to use leftover pork roast. I used powdered Ginger because that is what I had on hand. I am interested in rice bowls as a way to prepare meals ahead to freeze for use on busy weeknights; I will definitely be making this again for that purpose.

I made this rice and since we didn't have any pork, I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  I used Bragg "Liquid Aminos" instead of soy sauce as it is healthier and tastes just like it.  It turned out really, really good.  My husband and I loved it.

Very tasty & easy. Once the ingredients are prepped, it comes together quickly. I tossed in about a cup of frozen peas along with the other veggies. I'll definitely be making this again.

Turned out great! I made a few changes. I added peas, didn’t have any green onions, and put a little dash of hoisin sauce when I added the soya sauce. Husband gives it two thumbs up!

My family really like this recipe. So easy really. I used another reviewers idea of adding a small amt of oil to the cooked, then cooled rice, It really helped with fluffing up the rice.

Turned out great! My whole family doesn’t eat mushrooms, only me, so I didn’t add them. I also did not have any bell peppers. Even if I did, though, I probably would not have added them as I’m not usually a fan of adding bell peppers to my cooked dishes. Great meal, quick and simple. And yes, just as another writer wrote, the fresh ginger makes ALL the difference. Happy cooking!

Good fried rice, but it was a bit bland until we added some extra soy sauce and pepper to the servings on our plates. I also added a couple of eggs, which I Cooked right in the pan along with everything else, as most fried rice we’ve had at Chinese restaurants has eggs in it.

Yea, this is a excellent recipe and I will make it again but made some changes to up the flavor, I used my home made Vodka-5 Spice about 2 tablespoons, 2 teaspoons Nuoc Mam (Fish Sauce) and the pork I had from a previous recipe in the freezer was Char Siu and then sprinkled a little Red Pepper Flakes to spice things up.

So very easy!  I added 1/2 c. of a sesame salad dressing and some Asian Spice.  Have never added oil to the rice, and can't believe what a difference it makes in final dish.  Family loved it. This will be my go to recipe now for fried rice.

I used chopped ginger in a jar and didn't have celery so I left that out. I used brown rice instead and it was just as good as white rice but healthier! I used leftover grilled pork chops and topped it with sliced almonds when it was done for some crunch. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good! I followed the recipe pretty much as written except for messing up on the onions.  I missed the "1/2 small onion" and just put in the green onions - oops! I won't do that again.  I do think 6 Cups of rice is too much.  I made 6 cups but probably put only 4 C in the recipe.  Looking forward to eating it for lunch tomorrow!

I made this as written with the exception of leaving out the mushrooms and using an orange bell instead of red (would have looked nicer with the red one). I did not use all of the rice, maybe half the amount, since I was trying to use leftovers and not end up with more leftovers. The ginger definitely adds the main flavor but not in every bite. It's rather strong if you get a bite of it but then barely noticeable if you don't. I minced it as finely as I could so I'm not sure how to change that outcome. I added more soy sauce at the table but others didn't so I wouldn't say that it needed more, just my preference.

This was a great meal to use up leftover pork loin. I did add scrambled eggs as someone suggested and also did some asparagus because it is in season and I had some in my fridge. Will make this again.

good base recipe. I added more ginger (not fresh, didn't have any), more garlic, and soy sauce. may try adding some sesame oil next time... was good, just needs a bit more flavor and pep. might also add peas next time.

This recipe was quite good.  I made half the recipe as I only had 3 cups
of leftover rice and 1/2 of a pork tenderloin. I did put in all the mushrooms though and par-boiled my carrots and celery.  Next time I
think I will try putting in some hot pepper flakes as it seemed to need a little more "bite". The green onion was the crowning glory for this recipe.   Over all we liked it and will probably make it
again when I have some leftover rice with either pork or chicken. Postie

I see this is a great base recipe, and I do like the veggie combo as listed. What is special about this one is that it uses a good amount of fresh ginger and garlic. The amount of oil is too heavy handed (thus minus a star) for me; I prefer to use the 2 teaspoons for the meat/veggie stir fry, and just another teaspoon or so in the pan for the rice without adding any to the bowl of rice. A teaspoon of sesame oil is a nice flavor addition here. This was plenty in my non-stick skillet. If you like your rice to glisten with oil, the total 1/4 cup will give that effect.

This was very tasty and easy to make. My family likes scrambled eggs in the pork fried rice. I scrambled 3 eggs and added the eggs right before serving. Easy and quick to prepare.

This is a great recipe! I didn't use the mushrooms, carrots or bell peppers, as my daughter isn't a fan.  I used leftover pork tenderloin.  I also added frozen peas toward the end, simmering til they are hot.  The green onions over the top are a must.

Very good indeed! I added  1/4 cup chicken broth and then let simmer until most of the liquid was gone. I didn’t have any carrots on hand so I used chopped broccoli instead. Great way to use up left over pork meat. Will make again.

I used chicken instead of pork and I cut the veggies. I basically made it fried rice with chicken. Kept the green onions though.

I loved this recipe! It was the first time I made Pork Fried Rice and it turned out great! The only thing I did differently was to add mushroom soy sauce instead of the regular just before serving. Yum! I will definitely make this again.

I had some leftover pork roast and made this dish.  Goes  together really quickly and is very tasty.  Leftovers are good too, although might need to double recipe if you want enough leftovers to have a second goround for the family.  I had just enough the next day for a quick lunch for one person.  I added a scrambled egg for a little more volume.  Good eating!!

great base to work from what you have kicking around that needs to get cooked up. It needs pepper and any spices of choice, and egg if you got one,  otherwise a bit bland.

This is, unquestionably, the BEST fried rice we have ever had, commercial or homemade.  I agree that the fresh ginger is key to the exceptional flavor.  Perhaps the Basmati rice contributed, as well.  I didn't make any notable changes, except to omit the red pepper and to double the soy sauce.  This recipe is the very best!!! Oh and it requires 10 stars not 5.

I make this fairly often. One crucial missing ingredient, in my view, is several scrambled eggs. Make them slightly soft scrambled; the heat when you add them to the hot rice will finish them up. And for added flavor: a little butter in the oil, about 2 tsp sesame oil, and about 1-2 tsp MSG. Excellent! And of course adding other bits of meat is always good: shrimp, diced ham, chicken, etc.

I made this and had my mother -in-law over that night my husband and I loved it!! My mother-in -law said she would come back any time for it !!!!
         The only changes I made were I had to use ground ginger,I don't keep fresh on hand,minced garlic from the store I keep a large jar on hand and I had some fresh broccoli so I added that.
    Carrie thank you for sharing this tonight will be my third time making it!!!!
     I just serve it with egg rolls and soy sauce on the side.

I don't usually follow a recipe verbatim, this recipe is a great base.  I added 2scrambled eggs, 1/3bag of shredded Cole slaw mix with carrots, I added an extra shredded carrot, celery and onion and frozen peas.  Didn't have scallions. No leftovers, guess I'll just have to make it again.

This is a yummy meal, even the grandkids ate hearty.  I did read the other comments and made just a slight adjustment of only using 4 cups cooked rice (6 cups cooked rice is way too much) and adding 3 scrambled eggs.  I recommend to definitely add more soy sauce to your taste.  I also added some Hoisin sauce for a little spice.  I have never used fresh ginger, but it was definitely worth it.  This would be great with broccoli.  Will definitely make again!

Great way to get rid of leftovers! I agree with others that the fresh ginger is key. That was the predominant flavor. The dish as a whole was nothing special for me (definitely better than a restaurant though), but I will probably make it again next time I am trying to clean my fridge out!

I added egg & turkey bacon to my dish and added the soy sauce to taste, but other than that, the recipe was followed. It was very good. It will be made again.

This is a winner. Great way to use up leftover pork. Used only 4 cups of rice and added more soy sauce.
