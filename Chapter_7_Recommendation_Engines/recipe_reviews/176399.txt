Cookies bake up extremely soft and extend way too much.  It seems that the recipe needs more flour or less butter.  They taste pretty good.  I couldn't get them to brown.  They're hard to get off the cookie sheet because theyre so soft.  The pistachios lose all their crunch.

All the taste combinations go together.  The pistachio garnish is a must; without it, the cookies are too plain.  This will be a new holiday time favorite!

This was really yummy. I had to bake it about 12-13 minutes. They are a great adult cookie and I'll be giving them away for Christmas.

Brilliant!  These cookies are delightfully light and sophisticated. I did (as most reviewers do) modify the recipe and really loved it! I first used only 75% of the sugar called for but it really affected the texture (not as crisp). I used 1 1/4 C sugar, 2 TBS lemon zest, 1 TBS chopped fennel seeds, and 1 C of  chopped & roasted pistachios, about 1/2 c chopped & roasted pistachios to top. The result was light, buttery, crunch, flavourful, and aromatic. The fennel's not for everyone but those who like spices will adore these. I also prefer then in smaller, delicate pieces. Thanks for such a unique (and yummy) recipe!

The flavor combonation of the fennel, lemon, amaretto and pistacio is absolutely perfect. The rest of the recipe on the other hand, not so great. In the first batch I baked, the cookies spread out and got all crusty on the edges. WAY too much butter. I tossed a handful of flour in and the second half came out much better.

This cookie has a very unique flavor.  I don't cook much with fennel so it was nice change.  It definately stands out on the cookie platter.  I made these along with some other cookies and gave them to my neighbors for Christmas.  At first, I wasn't sure how I liked them but they grow on you.

Originally saw this recipe a few weeks ago in the Sunday newspaper and decided to make it to take to work.  It was a big hit with my coworkers.  They enjoyed the complex flavor and texture - the flavor was very reminiscent of an Italian style cookie and texture was somewhat similar to biscotti.

Followed recipe as written, but the dough was not "stiff".  It was very soft and difficult to form into balls.  Eventually gave up on forming the dough and used a cookie scoop to drop the dough onto the cookie sheet lined with Silpat. (I'd recommend using silicone baking sheet or parchment paper on the cookie sheet.  Makes for easy removal of the cookies after baking.)   I topped each cookie with chopped pistachios, which helped flatten/shape each cookie since the dough was soft.  Worked out beautifully.

These are a definite keeper and my coworkers are looking forward to the next time I make these.

These are complex and delicious and not overly sweet.
