We love this recipe, have been making this dip for years!  You can also top it with shredded lettuce, if you like.

This is a very basic layered dip. It called for too much garlic salt, in my opinion. I used probably less than 1 teaspoon, and it was plenty salty. If you wanted more garlic flavor, you could add garlic powder instead of all that salt. Also, I think the garlic salt would have been best mixed in with the cream cheese/sour cream. The recipe states that the picante sauce is to be divided, but doesn't state two places to use it in the recipe, so I put it all in the layer that was mentioned. I only used 1/2 an onion, and that was plenty oniony for me. This was fine if you have minimal ingredients, but I like the layered dip recipes that call for taco seasoning in the sour cream mixture.
