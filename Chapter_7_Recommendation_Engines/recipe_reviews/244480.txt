I omitted the sugar. I used 1/2 cup chopped figs, since 1 fig just wouldn't do! My scones baked 10 minutes, then I scored them, then baked an extra 15 minutes.  Perfect for summer fig season!

Delicious!!! The texture is perfect! I made this the first time with fresh figs and regular whole wheat flour and it was so good that I was craving it after fig season was over. I always can my extra figs in syrup and just made this with the canned figs... It was still delicious but next time I'll remember to cut or omit the sugar since my canned figs were already sweet. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I didn't make any major changes to this recipe, and it was great.  My family liked them too.  They are so good that I've made two batches in four days!

A wonderful way to start your morning with a cup of tea.  I didnâ€™t have whole wheat pastry flour so I did half whole wheat flour and half cake flour.  It worked out great.

Pretty darn good.  Batter is perfect after the diced figs are added.  Could still taste the fresh fig chunks in these scones

I enjoyed the flavor of the sweet figs to which I added slivered almonds.  The scones were rather crumbly.

I only had about 1 tsp baking powder left so I used baking soda and corn starch (equal amounts).  I also had to double tHe recipe because I had 2 cups of figs. I used maple syrup in the figs. (The turkey brown figs tasted bitter, I also had black mission figs). It's hard to rate when yoU changed it.  I had to bake it longer too.  I think I may have burned it a little.
