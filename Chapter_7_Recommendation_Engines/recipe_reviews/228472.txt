i'm experimenting with non traditional healthier stuffings for thanksgiving this year and used this recipe as a starting point.. i had cooked quinoa earlier today so i used that in place of the rice.. i left out the dill.. cut the poultry seasoning in half and the parsley down by 2/3.. i'm wondering if 2 tbsp is a misprint and if it's really supposed to be  2 tsp.. that's how much i used.. i reduced the onion by half and added equal parts of chopped celery.. i added about a little less than 1/3 c of water to get that wetter consistency i associate with stuffing.. this was great inspiration.. ty for the recipe

I added 2 celery stalks diced really thin with the onion saut√©. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms into the rice while cooking. Delicious and easy. Great recipe.

This was an amazing recipe. I stuffed it in the turkey aftee it cooled but it tasted great eve  before that. The only change I made was fresh parsley and not dried. With gluten free family members, this is a great alternative to bread stuffing.
