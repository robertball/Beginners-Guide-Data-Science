It sounds delicious - I only wish I owned an Insta-Pot. I may try to make this the old fashioned way. Would have been helpful to have the fact that this is an InstaPot recipe in the title or description.

I recently made a similar recipe (with carrots and onions and no meat) but the main difference (as a flavor enhancer) was fennel seed.  If you thought this soup was a little bland, try 1 to 2 tsp. of fennel seed and tsp. each of dried oregano and basil.  It really works well with the fennel bulb and cannellini beans.

Why would you make this in an Instant pot.  A little prep work, a regular soup pot, some simmering, and you are done.  You are using canned beans, they are already cooked.

Great hot soup for a cold night. It may be a little bland for some folks. I used chili flakes and some umami salt mix to zip it up a bit for us. Worth doing. Easy. By the way, I cooked ours on the stove for 30 minutes, then added the blended bean mixture and cooked for about 15 more.

Delicious. You did reduce the amount of sausage for health reasons and used fennel seed instead of fresh because I couldn’t find the bulb in the store. Loved it and you can improvise I think and it will still be delicious

I love this!  Added fresh toasted anise seed on top. Found cannellini beans dry at my local Indian market. This will totally cut down on cost compared to canned

As I do not have an Instant Pot , I made it in my regular soup pot on the stove and had to adjust the time accordingly .   It's not as flavorful as I expected.

I have never made a bean soup before and I absolutely loved this! I have no idea where to purchase truffle salt so I just skip that step completely, and instead of sausage I did do a smoked beef and everything worked out divinely. I paired it with some garlic bread and red wine. I’ve never been so content in my life.

I loved this soup! I used 16oz. ground turkey Italian sausage in place of the links. Also used about 1/2 tsp. dried thyme and put it in with the meat, beans, fennel. No other changes. It was really delicious and easy. I do have an InstaPot but I think this recipe would easily convert to a pot on the stove, just adjust cooking times a little.

Very nice tasty soup. You don't need an instapot (whatever that is); just simmer for 30 mins or so. I used butter beans instead of canellinis and some finally chopped salami instead of the sausage, simply because they were available. Would certainly make again.

I don't have a hot pot so I adapted the recipe by browning off the sausage, substituted 2 cups of diced onions, carrots, and celery for 2 cans of cannellini beans, added to the sausage, followed by the fennel, and served with Parmesan shavings. Fabulous!

I made this on the stove in a regular soup pan. I added carrots. This tasted even better on the second day. I really like the unique flavor the fennel adds.

This was very good and incredibly simple! We added some hot Italian sausage and dressed it with La Tur cheese instead of olive oil. YUM!

I made this on my stovetop since idi not have a pressure cooker.  I used canned cannelloni beans.  It is delicious.  The fresh thyme and truffle salt add a lot of flavor.

I made this the other night using a veggie sausage substitute. I cant have meat or pork so that is why the substitution.  I would imagine the real sausage would add more flavor. Used some basil and oregano to add flavor. It seemed a little bland but the fennel helped my stomach immensely so i will make this again..

I made it in a pot on my stove. Delicious, but used more broth. It was a little too salty, so I would omit the salt and then season to your taste!

I used home butchered sausage,  and  added home canned potatoes and carrots to this recipe .  I didn’t have a blender but used my Ninja smoothie maker to purée beans.   Super easy and delish!

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the suggestions of  one of the other reviewers and added basil, oregano and fennel seeds.  I used vegetarian Italian sausage and cooked on the stove.  I will definitely put this one in my regular rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Delicious, quick and fool-proof.  Very flavorful with a few simple ingredients. My family absolutely loved it, and I will make it again. I added a very small splash of heavy cream to finish, just because I had it on hand, but I'm sure it would be just as delicious without it.

Great idea. I changed a few things. I made 1/3 amt. I used one hot Italian sausage casing removed. Browned in 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp unsalted butter along with one medium leek thinly sliced no green stems. Added 1 clove minced garlic when sausage lightly browned and leek semi translucent and 1 cup fresh spinach leaves. After one minute added 1/2 can of rinsed white great northern beans. Mashed remaining 1/2 can of beans in 1/2 co unsalted chicken stock and added to mixture with 1/2 tsp thyme, stirred then added 2 cups chicken stock and let simmer for 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes. Great soup.

This recipe was delicious. I did make some adjustments to make it vegetarian and thus added some additional flavoring to compensate. 

I wasn’t sure how much 1 fennel bulb was and I had quite a large one so I only used 1 cup freshly minced fennel
2 cups vegetable broth into IP (instead of 1–for a total of 4 cups of vegetable broth)
3 beyond meat brats (vegetarian)
1/2 tsp onion powder 
1 cup chopped carrots
1/2 tsp dried Thyme instead of fresh
