I also thought it tasted like butter with a coco aftertaste as a previous reviewer stated. But I think it is a great starter recipe! I added 1/3 cup of powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Not as healthy, but very tasty. Let's face it, if you're looking at a recipe for a chocolate spread, you're probably not looking for something very healthyâ€¦ ;-)

Oh my goodness!  I'll always have everything on hand to whip this up.  A little bit less honey and a bit more cocoa for my preference.  And I don't think this will last two weeks in my fridge cause I'm gonna eat it :))

This just tasted like frosting to me..  I added some almond extract but it just did not satisfy.

Tastes best fresh.  We used kerrygold unsalted grassfed butter, organic cocoa powder, and honey.  Very chocolatey taste, and did taste a little nutty from the honey. Our family enjoyed it!  Thank you.

I made it just as the recipe had said but there was liquid in the bottom after. It tasted very, very bad and i don't know if the liquid was from the butter or honey so it is possibly my fault.

Unless you change the recipe a bit it just taste like butter with a cocoa aftertaste. I used 1/2 the amount of powder suger to the amount of cocoa powder. I also used a some chocolate syrup to make it even more chocolatey.

Hmm, I don't know what to think about this? I used the change servings button to make a very small serving to try it out of curiosity. It is missing the nuts to be like nutella, as suggested. Could there be a misprint here? I then thought maybe it would be like a chocolate flavored honey butter, and unique tasting. However, it just tasted like butter with a cocoa after taste. To make things worse it doesn't spread, once chilled, as assumed by the recipe title. I am curious to see what others think?
