My chicken didn't turn out well the first time I attempted to use the recipe as posted.  I used chicken drumsticks, not breasts, and it took forever the inside of the chicken to cook while the outside coating became rubbery.  So having been raised a good portion of my childhood in Kentucky I remembered that mamy people boiled the chicken first (not all the way cooked) before coating and frying.  This allows for way less cooking time in the skillet and the for the coating to be crispy, not chewy.  Also, a good way to get rid of that blood that comes from the bone while frying (if not using the boil method)...soak the chicken in ice and water with salt for about half an hour before cooking.

I am Southern and I can fry some chicken, but this impressed me. I usually fry with just flour, salt and pepper, but I added the spices and the egg mixture. It was good. I didn't measure anything out, just threw the spices in. I added alot more garlic, I love it, and of course more salt amd pepper. I salted and peppered the chicken and the egg mixture. You cannot fry chicken in 15 minutes. I cooked on high for 5, then flipping, on medium, with lid on for 20. Nice and crispy. Served with baked potato and corn. Will make again.

Want the most tender, moist fried chicken?  Try marinating the chicken for at least 4 hours (if not all day) in buttermilk.  Out of this world - great to use buttermilk when soaking raw onions for onion rings too.  In order to cut down on the actual frying time, I generally brown my chicken and then place it on a broiler rack and bake it for 45 minutes in a 375 oven.  The broiler rack allows alot of the fat to drip off.  Line the bottom with foil and spray the rack with Pam before placing chicken pieces on top, clean up is a breeze.

I too like a bit of dill in my chicken coating and I use ordinary flour instead of bread crumbs.  I also add a generous portion of Lawry's salt, but you can also use Lemon Pepper if you are watching your salt intake.

Just a quick note: This is my recipe and my original recipe called for tablespoons of garlic pwdr and AR edited it to teaspoons. I had mentioned this in an earlier review but the review was deleted ): Also, granulated garlic really brings out that garliky flavor! but, 'tis all to taste---play with it and see what works best for you! ~Tan~
PS Also wanted to say that I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the seasoned bread crumbs. This also makes really good chicken for Chicken Parmesan, which I do often. (:

Two words... OVEN FRY! Why not try to make this healthier and cut out some of the fat/cholesterol but not loose the wonderful fried taste. I soaked the chicken breasts in buttermilk for 2 hours and then I floured them, egged them and used the breadcrumb mixture last.  I sprayed Pam on the breasts and I oven fried my chicken at 400 for about 25 minutes ( I hade 2 chicken breasts that were pounded thin) I cut mine into small pieces AFTER they were cooked and added it to a large garden salad.

I read this recipe's notation from the original submitter who added on 5/31/05 that the recipe was supposed to be in tablespoons, and not teaspoons for the garlic.  I cooked it using TBL. and it was great. It was so flavorful and very crispy on the outside.  I used cube steaks because I love chicken fried steak and it was way better than restaurant quality.  Make sure to use up that leftover dry mix for the gravy. Yum!

De-freaking-licious!  I am normally AGAINST frying any of my food, but had to try this one after everyone at The Quality Cook raved about it.  I used lots of garlic, doubled the paprika and used Panko crumbs as opposed to regular breadcrumbs.  Also, I seperated the flour from the Panko mixture (and seasoned both) then dredged the chicken in the flour, followed by the egg and finally the Panko crumbs.  I lost very little - if any - of the breading during the frying process (a miracle from my perspective).  Loved it - thanks much Tan!!!

Ok, I changed this one up a bit. Like other reviewers, I upped the garlic powder. I upped the seasoned bread crumbs, omitting the flour and popped this in the oven and baked it. I have low tolerance for frying foods and I love that I don't have to mind the oven during cooking. Also, I used Italian bread crumbs, added some shredded Parmesan cheese, omitted the paprika but added Italian spices and had Italian tasting chicken another night. Thanks for the post :-)

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was simply southern delicious!  ...On a side note; it bothers me that people change or alter recipes and then rate them.  Their reviews reflect THEIR altered recipe, not the ORIGINAL as posted; which in turn affect the overall rating.

I made these cutlets for my chicken parm and I'm happy to say that my gang and I thought they were absolutely delicious. So flavorful, moist and tender to boot. Just as a note, for the reviewer who used bone in dark meat (wings and thighs) dark meat takes much longer to cook than boneless chicken breasts. Thanks so much Tancal29, we'll certainly be making these again!!

I'll been making my Fried Chicken like this for years. The only thing I do differently is instead of using a shallow dish I put the mixture in a plastic ziploc bag and shake it. I then let it dry for an hour so the bread crumbs with stick better I also fry in in the oven by first spraying the pan with pam and oil and cooking  for 15 mins or so and flip at 375 degrees. Just my two cents worth. Thanks for sharing

I haven't tried this version.  However, I use to watch my grandmother make a true garlic fried chicken.  I suggest following the recipe. However, under cooking the chicken by 2 mins.  Warm the oven to 325 degrees and place undercooked chicken in a foil lined pan.  sprinkle chicken with real chopped garlic 3 or 4 tablespoons. Make sure each piece has some garlic. Let the chicken cook another 10-15 mins.  This is our family secret and it is a HUGE hit!!!  Enjoy!!!

A definite keeper. My picky son loved it. I served his with sweet n sour sauce dip and I made brown gravy for my husband and I.  Served it with sauteed garlic asparagus.  My husband said it's like Wendy's Chicken Nuggets turned (maybe that's why my son loves it.)  As always, whenever I dredge any meats in a flour/seasoning mixture, I let it sit for about 1/2 hour in the fridge covered before I fry it. The chicken turned out quite flavorful. Thanks.

LOVE this recipe. I like to beat the chicken breasts down into thinner pieces and soak in buttermilk for a couple of hours. Makes great chicken fried chicken!

This was probably the BEST very well seasoned fried chicken I have ever had. I read through some of the comments and used 2 tablespoons of garlic powder as suggested instead of teaspoons because that would not have been enough. (It wouldn't hurt to put a lil more in either) I followed all the other measurements as listed. I also took the suggestion of someone else and marinated the chicken in buttermilk for a few hours. When I was ready to cook I took 1/2 cup of fresh buttermilk (not from the marinade) and mixed it w/ 1 egg coated w/ the flour/bread crumb mixture and fried. I also seasoned the meat itself w/ a little salt on both sides after dredging w/ the egg/buttermilk mixture. It was DELICIOUS. I will most def make this again!! It was moist inside and crunchy on the outside. This is especially good because white meat tend to be dry.

This recipe is surprisingly delicious! I altered it slightly by rubbing garlic on the chicken first, then cooking on the stovetop for 10 minutes, then baking it in the oven for about 30 minutes, turning once. Thanks!

This was just okay, not as good as I thought it would be.  I did read the submitter's review and use Tablespoons not teaspoons of garlic powder and I'm glad I did or it would have been incredibly plain.

You most certainly CAN fry to done pounded-out half chicken breasts in 15 minutes! In fact, 10 minutes (5 per side) is right for 1/4" thick. Pretty good recipe made as is. Better with potato flakes and/or saltines instead of bread crumbs for coating.

I made this with chicken breasts because my husband hates to each chicken off the bone. It was wonderful! He asked me to save the recipe and make it again. The only thing I added was some sea salt. This is a keeper and will go in to our family recipe book!

I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and added extra garlic and lemon pepper.  It came out great!  My husband loved it, and he is NOT a big chicken fan.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was phenomenal!  Please note that the recipe says 4 skinless and boneless chicken breasts for all the people that used bone in chicken!!  Follow the directions and you won't have to worry about the chicken not fully cooking through!  Also I only used the 2 tsps of garlic powder and was disappointed that it didn't really have much of a garlic taste.  I didn't see the the author's post below about it being 2 tbsps!  But it still tasted awesome, so next time I will try the 2 tbsps for more garlic flavor!  I also used a pack of chicken tenderloins instead of breasts bc that was what I had on hand.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I can see how if you used bone in chicken it wouldn't get cooked all the way through, so you might have to use one of the other suggested methods after frying to get it cooked through if you insist on using bone in chicken.  Definitely worth it, must try, very easy recipe!  Thanks for posting!

Being as the garlic states 'to taste' I used a little extra. I used W/W flour and canola oil for a healthy fried chicken, and this turned out GREAT.

My family loved this.  I did add more garlic than called for though and it came out delicious.  All of them during the course of eating it said "give this one 5 stars!"

This was wonderful!  I am very picky, but I loved it.  It had a nice crispness to the breading.  The only change I'll make next time is a little bit more garlic.

This turned out great! I made gravy out of the left over dry ingredients. I only used half a cup of oil to fry with in a fry pan on the stove top at medium heat.

This deserves 10 stars!  It is delicious!  Follow recipe and you will love it too!.  The only change I made was I cooked it at 300 not 350 and for about 4 minutes on each side not 5 to 6, but it could depend on the skillet, so just keep on eye on it so that it doesnt burn.  Other than that, great!  I made this twice this week, and its only wednesday!  Will def make this again and again!

Great recipe! I added extra 2 garlic powder but it still needed a little more flavor. I also used panko bread crumbs because I like the texture a lot more. I will make this again but maybe add a little more seasonings.

This is really good.  I used chicken tenders instead in 1/4 inch of peanut oil over the stove.  Extra garlic powder was a good suggestion, too!!  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

These are easy to make, tastes great, and excellent for a quick dinner. My 2.5yr old daughter loves them. I added some cayenne pepper to the 2nd batch, and loved the spicy version as well. It's so good to have them oven baked instead of frying, feels much healthier, yet can indulge at the same time in some crispy chicken.

Very good moist fried chicken. I used chicken scallopinni so it was already pounded nicely thin. The only thing I would do next time is cut back on the flour mixture because it made way too much

This was great! I used chicken strips instead of breast haves, and added 2 tablespoons of garlic instead of teaspoons. Even my picky 6 year old loved it.  Goes great with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Absolutely delicious!  Used suggestion of another reviewer and browned in hot oil, then transferred to 375 oven for 45 minutes.  Also deviated from instructions by dredging in flour alone first, then dipping in egg/milk mixture, and finally coating with crumb mixture before placing in hot oil.  Best fried chicken ever!!

Best fried chicken ever!! I took the advice of some other reviews and did a three-dip process: First in flour, then in milk/egg, then in the rest of the dry ingredients. It kept the breading from coming off during frying and eating. I pounded the chicken breasts thin so the coating wouldn't burn while the chicken was cooking. I recently saw where the original recipe was supposed to be in tablespoons of garlic, not teaspoons. That made the flavor WONDERFUL! My usually picky daughter can't get enough of this. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

This was sooo good!!! I made it exactly as written except I had drumsticks & I marinated them for an hour in buttermilk! I fried them until brown & crispy & then baked at 400 degree's for 25 minutes! Served with creamy spiced coleslaw & Kentucky biscuits both from this site & fresh corn on the cob! It hit the spot!!!

Yum.  I used my cast iron skillet and I think that really helped with flavor and texture.  Very fattening, but worth it now and then.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best fried chicken. It was my 1st time to make fried chicken & it came out perfect. I did marinate for the chicken for 6hrs in buttermilk & spices. Didnt have to use the milk & egg since the chicken was already soaking in the buttermilk with spices. Shallow fried instead of deep frying.

Was an excellent recipe. Only thing I changed was the amount of garlic powder ( 1 1/2 TBS) just like many reviewers said.  Honestly this was my first attempt with fried chicken (I usually just buy it! ) But my youngest  son said that this chicken recipe tasted BETTER than any of the store bought or fast food chicken restaurants we go to! This recipe will be made again and again!!  Plus it was easy to make!!!! Thanks for submitting it!!

delicious! Yummy Yummy! I cook mainly for myself so I dont have to worry about left overs and I usually dont cook the same recipe twice in a row- but I cooked this for two nights straight. Thats how good it was! I upped the Paprika just a smidge because I like some hotness to my food, and I double coated the chicken breast to give it an extra cripsy layer. Good recipe! thank you for sharing!

This was very good!!! Only made 1 change to the recipe, sprinkled the chicken breasts with Johnny’s Seasoning salt.  Will definitely make this again.  Leftovers are great for chicken salads the next day. 

 * Made this recipe again last night only this time I turned it into Malibu Chicken after cooking the chicken breast I put 2 slices of Canadian bacon, 1 pineapple ring, and a slice of swiss cheese on each breast. On top the Swiss cheese I drizzled Tamari(soy sauce) and Mango Peach Salsa (Santa Barbara brand) for a bit of a kick and sweetness.  Put back in the oven till cheese melted……WOW, THIS IS TRULY FANTASTIC A MUST TRY

This was really good. Thank goodness I did use the 2 tablespoons of garlic powder as Tana had recommended as I would think it would be quite bland without it. I also used another reviewer's suggestion of coating the chicken with flour first, then the egg mixture, then coating with the bread crumb mixture. It fried to perfection and I didn't lose any of the coating! Great tip! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Good Chiken!Do not own an electric Skillet so I fried each side for a few min then put in oven at 350 for 15min.I also added more garlic powder and seasoned the chiken with adobo before dipping.Will make again soon!!!!

Yum! In the past my fry attempts have been sad... but this dish went great! Used my electric skillet and got rave reviews from my family. Simple ingredients, followed to a "T". I did cook it less than 5 mins, so just eyeball it to a golden brown on each side. Served with mashed potatoes, salad and black eyed peas for New Years! Definitely a keeper! :)

OMG! This is so good that I'm surprised that it's legal! I used  coursely ground cornflakes instead of breadcrumbs, and the texture was great, the chicken was very moist and flavorful. Ummm, I want more!

WOW!!! This was AMAZING!! I wasn't sure about this at 1st but it was SO easy! I thawed the chicken then I put it in a bag with milk, paprika, salt & pepper, and I put that in the fridge for about 5 hours. Then I followed the recipe- I used my electric skillet to make sure the heat stayed consistent and turned the timer on for 5 min each side and it was perfect. The chicken was cooked prefect and so moist, and the outside was crunchy. Also make sure you pound the chicken- otherwise you are just making fried chicken not chicken fried chicken. I made with mashed potatos and peppered gravy. Not healthy, but totally worth it!!!

I really liked this. The original poster of this recipe says that the garlic powder is supposed to be Tablespoons NOT teaspoons. It makes a difference! Here in Bolivia they have a similarly prepared meal that they call 'milanesa'. I like this better! This is more flavorful.

this was great! i wish the recipe came with a good gravy to put on top!  i'm a huge dressing fan so i tried this with both ranch and ketchup and it was wonderful!!!!!!  My husband enjoyed it plain.

Good, quick dinner with warm canned green beans and quick box mashed potatoes.

OMG!!!!  This chicken was AWESOME!!!!!  I followed the recipe as directed,  but I tweaked it just a little!!!!  Before cooking,  I pounded out the chicken,  dropped in some buttermilk,  and then dredged it in the dry ingredients,  fried it,  and then put it in the oven for another 11 minutes,  and it took out the oil,  and it was fantastic!!!  The chicken came out nice and tender and juicy,  and even my husband commented on how good it was!!!  I tried doing fried chicken a few years ago,  and it didn't get cooked all the way through!!!!  I did this, and it came out perfect!!!!  I am making this again,  it was a huge hit!!!!! Thank you for sharing Tanaquil!!!!! :-)

I have made this before and loved it as written (but with 2 T garlic as suggested by Tanaquil).  Tonight I decided to use it for chicken nuggets and realized I was out of bread crumbs, so I used Bisquick in place of the flour/bread crumb combo.  It was delish!

This was my first time cooking fried chicken and it came out perfect! Since I only had plain bread crumbs, I added some Italian seasoning to the breading mix. This is definitely a recipe to eat on the day that it is made. I brought some left overs to work the next day, and it was not nearly as yummy as it was the night before.

Outstanding! I browned this in oil and then baked at 385 for 25 minutes on a broiling pan. I had boneless breasts that I pounded thin. It was the most tender an juicy chicken I have made. Not the best cook here so it was a happy suprise to eat something good that I actually made.

I made this chicken using chicken stripes.  It was very easy to use and my whole family loved it.  My little 4yr old even had seconds which is a rare thing.  I used my deep fat fryer to fry the chicken instead of the electric skillet since I didn't have one.  Thanks for this great recipe, I will now use this recipe all the time.

This is an awesome recipe! I did tweak it to make it my own and here's what I did: I didn't have bread crumbs at the time so I crushed up some garlic flavored croutons, and I used buttermilk. I doubled the recipe because I was using wings and I had to cook about 18 of them. The overall taste of the chicken was delicious! My oldest daughter the pickiest of all three of my girls asked me to make it again the next day. I am trying it today (9/3/10) for dinner with pork chops.

My daughter loves TV dinners with chicken fried chicken, so I wanted to surprise her tonight by making it from scratch.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used 2 TBS of garlic powder instead of 2 tsp.  The flavor of the breading was excellent, but the chicken needed to be seasoned prior to breading, too.  After frying all the chicken, I added 2 Tbs of butter to the oil left in the pan, then added some of the leftover breading mixture, milk, a little more salt, and lots more fresh cracked pepper for an amazing gravy to serve over the chicken.  I'll definitely make this again, seasoning the chicken prior to breading.  Thanks for sharing!

OK but I didn't find this recipe flavorful. Next time I make it I'm going to have to spice it up.

Very good! My complaint with other fried chicken recipes I've tried has been lack of flavor - the garlic powder & pepper gave this a great taste. Hubby was impressed and my little guy ate it up. We'll use this recipe again!

I soaked the flattened chicken in buttermilk substitute,(1 tbsp lemon juice to 1 c. milk, for 3 hours or so before coating in flour, then egg, than spiced crumbs... be sure to use 2 tbsp of garlic instead of the tsp mistake, it makes a huge difference! also, be careful not to start with oil that is too hot, or the crumbs burn.

Very tasty and juicy!! I cooked on the stove top for 4 min per side and doubled the garlic. I used buttermilk in place of the regular milk.

This is great if you follow the directions.  Pounding the chicken breast is really important so I wouldn't skip this step.  I really loved the garlic flavor, but if you marinate the breast in buttermilk and some garlic cloves, it moistens/seasons the chicken and is great!

Very Good Recipe! This was my first time playing with hot oil and I was impressed how well this came together. My only suggestion would be to let the chicken sit on paper towel for a few minutes so that it's not so greasy. Thanks so much!

This was delicious!!! I have used it now on all different types of chicken (breasts, thighs, drumsticks...) and it always turns out good. I have also used a deep fryer and skillet. It is a very versatile recipe and I will be using it over and over!

This recipe is outstanding. I went right by the recipe step-by-step. I wouldn't change a thing. The chicken breasts were not dried out and the taste was great. I can't see rating this anything but 5 stars. Great recipe!

My husband liked this more than I did.  I think the recipe should specify how thick your chicken should be in order for it to cook thoroughly.  Mine had to go into the oven for about a half hour after I fried it and after that it was not crunchy.  The breading was delicious and I definitely used more garlic.  Next time I will know to make sure I pound them thin.

I made the breading exactly as originally written (2 tbsp of powdered garlic).  I double battered the chicken and did chicken strips instead of cutlets.  I warmed the oven to 350 and put almost done chicken in pan in oven until all the pieces were done.  This was very tasty and the chicken was very moist.  I served with a leafy green salad and butter noodles.  Definitely will make again.

I just made this for lunch and it was delicious! I did use chicken legs and marinated them in buttermilk, salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. The fried them for a few minutes on each side and baked them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes to finish them off. Moist and delicious!!! Thank you for thr great recipe!

I think I have finally found a keeper. I was using the "Better Than The Best Fried Chicken" recipe from this site. This recipe is way better, my who beileves Fried Chicken should only be dipped in Salt and Pepper said this recipes was awesome. I did how ever add a couple dashes of Lawry's Season Salt. I also double dipped the Chicken, which seemed to really seal in the flavor. I cooked each side Five Minutes just like the Recipe called for it turned out great. Awesome Recipe!!!!!!!!

This was really, really good. And super easy. I used a plain old skillet and I had three breasts which I cut in half before pounding. A good way to stretch food dollars. I will definitely make this again!

Was wanting to try something different with my fried chicken..this was ok, I guess I was expecting something more. Umm...Anyway, I also used some Tony's seasoning which I always use on my fried chicken. The guys liked it and I did too. Will probably make again some day. Served with french fries and a hearty salad.

Awesome!  Have already made this several times.  I like the combo of the flour and bread crumbs.

I used this recipe's ingredients and another recipe's cooking method. I also upped the garlic powder as per the submitter's recommendation (to 2 tablespoons). This was a great fried chicken! I cut my breast halves into tenders and fried them for 4-5 minutes per side. I did find that I had way more bread crumb and egg/milk mixture than was needed, so I double-dipped and that used up a lot of the excess (though naturally it was messier!) Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Husband prefers dark meat so I bought boneless thighs for him and used boneless breasts for the my daughter and myself.  Make sure to pound thin, is my only recommendation.  Hit with the family. Made no changes to recipe.

Wow wow wow!  This stuff is good!  If you like it really crunchy with extra breading, dip in the milk/egg mixture, then coat with the dry and let it sit for a few minutes.  Then repeat.   Sooo good!  I didn't have any problems with the chicken not cooking through, you shouldn't have problems as long as the chicken is pounded thin enough.  This is great, I will make this a regular and even use this breading for my chicken fried STEAK.  Yum!

I enjoyed the seasonings/flavor but the bread crumbs mixed with the flour did not add much for me.  In the south, this is the method (minus breadcrumbs) we use for frying chicken.  The review that explained turning up the heat each time you add chicken and then lowering it was very helpful in keeping the coating on the chicken.

Quick easy and delicious!  Especially if you have a fryer.  I use Italian bread crumbs and would add a little more salt to the batter.  I also use thin cut chicken breasts - i get nervous about thicker pieces cooking all the way through before the batter becomes too well done.    Great recipe!

This was great! I couldn't believe how easy it would be. I just moved into an aparment so I'm trying to cook different dishes.  I soaked the chicken breast in buttermilk for about 2 hours and breaded them and I doubled the amount of paprika.

This was just not spicy enough for us; will make again leaving out the salt and adding a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, yes, a tablespoon.  I really think the breading would be crispier if double dipped in the flour mixture; dip in flour mixture then in egg mixture, back into flour mixture.  TIP: be sure your oil temp is at least 350 degrees and do not over crowd your pan as this will bring your temp down and breading may fall off and will retain more of the grease.  I usually heat my oil to 360 degrees to allow for a bit of dropping in temp.  When chicken is done drain on a cooling rack with paper towel beneath to catch dripping grease, allowing air all around your meat it will be crispier and not soggy on the bottom as often happens.

I made this dish a couple of days ago with thighs (it's all I had).  I took note of other raters saying the recipe didn't call for enough spices, so here's what I did:  I cut down on the flour, upped the seasoned (or Italian) breadcrumbs by about 1/2 cup, and added about half-again as many spice(s).  Voila!  Also, I cooked the chicken pieces on the stove top for about 3-minutes each side (my oil was a little hot and they crisped up much faster than I thought they would) and finished them off in a 400 degree oven while I made the side dishes, set the table, etc. ... about 30-40 minutes.  The family loved it, and the leftovers didn't quite make it to the dinner table the second day - they were gone by lunchtime.  Crispy, tasty chicken in no time ... thanks for sharing!

I don't usually make fried chicken because I haven't found the right recipe...until now! This makes chicken wonderfully tasty and I was amazed at how juicy the chicken stayed. Make sure to let each side cook long enough before turning over so the batter adheres to the chicken. This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Thank you!

Wowser!!  This was GOOD!  I followed the recipe, except that I used tablespoons of all the spices and I only had plain bread crumbs, so I added a tablespoon of poultry spice as well.  Yum, yum, yum.  I served it with Cowboy Mashed Potatoes from this site.

This was completely outstanding! I found it tastier to use two TBSP of granulated garlic rather than the two tsp. suggested.  My family never loved my fried chicken until this recipe came along.  Thanks! We also used those Foster Farms thin-sliced chicken breasts rather than pounding the chicken.

I found this recipe over 3 years ago and have been making every since. For my late husband god love him and may he watch me from heaven loved it. I am making tonight for neighbors that loved it supplied the chicken for them two myself and another neighbor and her mom we all eat them with different things. Not the bow ties I and my neighbor and her mom are having egg noodles and butter. The neighbors that gave us the chicken are having them with vegetables. But they all love it around here and my family as well. When I say family talking good size people.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as is - we really liked the gravy - a lot of flavor compared to other recipes I've tried.  This also works well with minute steaks for country fried chicken!

This dish was delicious. The chicken was tender, the flavour amazing. My only reservation was the amount of oil used. If I make this again, I will use just enough oil to brown the chicken on both sides, then finish them off in the oven.

This was wonderful. Somehow I've made it almost 40 years without ever making fried chicken. I was a bit intimidated. But, this recipe got rave reviews and it seemed pretty easy. I used our wok and did everything as described except we cut up our chicken into strips for our kids. This cut down on the cooking time by a few minutes.

And the results? Wow! Everyone gobbled them up and loved them. The taste was excellent...love the garlic powder (be sure to use 2 TBSP and not 2 tsp) added to the mix. 

We'll be making this for years to come! I'm not intimidated anymore!

It was excellent, next time I want to soak the chicken strips in buttermilk all day and do a double batter with more seasonings. Very simple to make and affordable too. Made it with mashed potatoes and green beans, fiance loved it!

This is a very good recipe.  I did read the other reviews and added a bit of seasoned salt and a bit more than the required 2 Tbsp of garlic powder.  Also instead of just milk I split the recipe to 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  The chicken turned out so moist and the flavor was great.  I will definitely prepare this again.  This chicken would be good for a summer picnic (cold chicken).

Pretty good-nice and juicy. It was a tad salty, so I think that could be eliminated. I fried it until golden brown and then put it in the oven to finish cooking it. It was nice and crispy.

I have never fried chicken before and couldn't believe how easy it was! I didn't have bread crumbs but it had some stale crackers that I crumpled up. Also I was out of milk the only "creamy" like substance I had was a can of cream of mushroom soup so I mixed that in with the egg. I didn't measure anything and it still turned out amazing! I will be saving this recipe.

Yummy! Family loved it. Thank you. I did per another reviewer's suggestion and after frying 5mins each side, baked at 350 for an add'l 11 minutes. It was still crispy, yet tasted better than being completely fried. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. It came out perfect. I only added just a tad salt and pepper to the egg mixture and used about a cup and half of oil. Some of the best fried chicken i ever had. It was super easy to. I pounded my chicken flat so it would knock out alot of cooking time.

Oh mylanta this was wonderful. I didn't have a few things in the house and since I'm odd I substituted the milk for a bit of honey dijon mustard and sourcream and some chopped garlic already made and mixed that with the egg and in the flour I put garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, lemon pepper, salt, left out the bread crumbs and battered some fat chicken strips  twice battered (I saw Paula Dean do that once) n fried it up and it was THE BEST fluffiest crunchiest tastiest chicken strip I have ever had lol. I'm not even exagerating.

I made this, as directed for my family. I found the chicken to be rather dry, but the seasonings were delicious. We added oregano and basil, along with some paprika. If you like fried boneless chicken steaks this is very good but keep an eye on it. Not every stove cooks the same. We served it with green beans and mashed potatoes. A nice chicken dinner, traditional and pleasing to young and old.

This is a wonderful batter! My husband doesn't like the packaged coatings, but my kids love the texture of them, I tried this on them and it was a hit all around!  I did bake it instead of frying it, and it still turned out great!  The coating was nicely crisp, the chicken was still juicy and it had a wonderfully aromatic garlic flavour!

I used chicken tenders and boiled them first to precook. I fried them for about ten minutes and they were pretty good. Mayber fry them for 6-8 minutes instead next time b/c they were a bit tough but delicious.

Yummy. It's a nice change on traditional fried chicken. The only thing id change is instead of the whole piece of chicken id make em strips because even after beating the chicken flat it still took awhile to cook all the way trew, so I think flattened strips would cook faster and less dark.

Wish it was spicy. Next time I'm going to add some jalapeño to it. Other than that pretty good.

This was a good recipe but didn't necessarily stand out. I personally think it could use more garlic. Will try again until I get it just right.

I made chicken tenders and my 7 yo could not get enough of them. Were nice and crispy and the chicken was still juicy in the middle! Turned out really well, made exactly like recipe stated except TBS instead of TPS for the garlic powder.

This is an easy recipe which I liked.  The only things I did different was added an additional teaspood of garlic powder and I baked this for about 20 minutes as suggested previously.  My family really enjoyed this and I didn't feel guilty since I baked it instead of deep fry.    This is a keeper!  Thanks!

This was my first time making this. I turned out wonderfully. I took the advice from a previous review and marinated the chicken breasts in buttermilk for about 3 hours. It was so tender and very tasty. I love the taste of garlic so I used a teaspoon of garlic salt instead of regular salt, and I used italian seasoned bread crumbs. The flavors really popped. I used a southern fried chicken gravy  recipe that I had found on this website as well. Everyone loved it all. Thank you for making my first attempt such a success.

I made this for my boyfriend, and he loved it. It is a bit high in fat, but the taste is amazing. I doubled the spices and bread crumbs. I used tenders, and pounded them thin. It was perfect, they cooked quickly and I served each person 2, and it was the perfect amount. I served with mashed potatoes and gravy along with roasted broccoli and carrots. Amazing meal!!!

Loved it.   Not being a professional cook :  ) I wasn't sure how to tell that the oil was the right temp... so i guessed.  If in the same boat, start out low.  Sounds obvious, but if you're like me you think it's not hot enough and keep turning it up.  I think I started out too high but took it really low to compensate and it still turned out great.

This was very good.  I added 1/2 tsp of Cayenne for some bite and it could use a touch more salt. I also cooked in olive oil.  Otherwise these are great with some sweet/sour sauce!

Very Good! I added more pepper than the recipe called for and may add a little Cajun seasoning next time as another reviewer suggested. It was simply delicious as written though and I will definitely be making this again! Yum!!!

Fantastic recipe! I made only a few minor adjustments, including about 1/4 cup corn meal into the breading and a few extra spices like seasoned salt and extra red pepper since I'm a pepper head! I couldn't fit all the chicken I made in my skillet, so I decided to try it both fried and baked (based on some other reviews) and found that both came out crispy, juicy and delicious. Definitely a keeper in my book!

This is the BEST fried chicken I have tried on this website!!  I took other reviwers' suggestions...not using bread crumbs only flour with the spices, soaking the chicken with buttermilk for a few hours, coating the chicken right from the buttermilk soak (egg allergy), I fried the coated chicken in some peanut oil about 2 minutes each side (to brown up) and then placed it on a wire rack in the oven at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes or so (depending on how small I cut up the pieces).  The chicken was incredibly tender inside but crunchy outside...I will say, though, add more spices, while the chicken had flavor it could've used a bit more.  Kids and husband LOVE it and I will be using this one again and again!!  Thank you very much for sharing!!!!  8D

I thought this chicken turned out pretty good. I overdid it a bit with the seasoning salt I used, so was a tad salty. How do I keep the coating from coming off the chicken? I tried dipping in the flour mixture first, then egg & then flour mixture agan. That didn't work.

This has become my husband and sons favorite meal. They both get really happy when I make this. I do follow the instructions as written and it turns out great every time. The chicken is very moist and the outside is crispy. Very good!!

This is a fantastic recipe!  A true comfort food!  My fiancé and I both loved it.  He just kept saying "wow, baby".  I sprinkled the garlic powder, paprika, salt, & pepper on the chicken.  Next, I dipped it in the egg & milk mixture. Then I coated the chicken with the bread crumb/flour mixture (I used crushed croutons).  I think next time I will add more bread crumbs and maybe do 6 minutes on each side.  I like a more crispy texture.  Overall this is great recipe that I will make again and again.  Thanks!!

This was the best fried chicken I've ever made.  Coming from a family big on their Southern heritage, my husband has always been big on homemade fried chicken.  I'm generally good at making most West and Southwest food but every time I've tired making fried chicken for my husband it has always been very bland and floury tasting.  This time I had to keep him from eating all the rest of the chicken.  Now I realize I just wasn't using nearly enough spices.  I followed this recipe almost exactly (I used a little less milk and flour) and this was the first time I really liked what I'd made. This was awesome! Thanks.

I followed this recipe as it is written and it rewarded me with tenderness on the inside and crispy crunchy goodness on the outside interspersed with fabulous flavor! It cooks up to a beautiful golden brown that had my family looking at their plates and saying "MMMMMM-MMMMM".  I am from the deep south and nothing says comfort like GOOD fried chicken. Of course I won't cook this every week as I want to preserve our good health... but if you are looking for some comfort food as a special treat for you and your family, this is definitely the ticket!  Add some mashed potatoes & gravy, green beans, tossed salad, rolls, and sweet tea. Serve chocolate and lemon meringue pies for dessert (Yesss-- Do both to satisfy everyone!!)  Just too much good!!

I just got done eating this recipe and let me tell you that it is the best chicken I have ever eaten.  I took the advice of another reviewer and soaked the chicken in buttermilk overnight and it is fantastic!  I will definitely make this recipe a lot!

We eat breaded chicken a lot and I felt like I needed a change from my usual. I went looking for something different and This recipe happened to be on the opening page when I went searching. The chicken was moist and the coating crunchy. The only change I made was increasing to 3 tsp garlic powder and added a heaping 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for a little kick. It was very good. The chicken was moist and the breading was crispy. This may be my new favorite chicken recipe!

I made this last night for my in-laws and they raved about it.  I took the suggestions and double breaded by chicken.  I also used corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I used fresh garlic, and you can really tell the difference between fresh and powder here.  I pounded the breasts pretty thin, so I only needed 5 min on the first side, and 2 on the second.  It was really delicious.  My husband said "Honey, you could sell this stuff."  This is a definite keeper for us.

Wow!  I'm so in awe of this recipe! It deserves a higher rating! My husband said it was better than you can eat at any restaurant, and he should know because he always orders Chicken fried chicken or Chicken Fried Steak.  It was tender, moist and the topping was light and seasoned to perfection!  Thank you Tancal29 for making tonight's diner a huge hit!

DELICIOUS! My husband and kids declared this "the best chicken ever!" Just a side note: As I was preparing the chicken, I realized I did not have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed Ritz crackers instead.

This recipe is simply delicious!  Not too overpowering, and just enough room left for me to experiment.  This was my first time frying chicken, and I don't think I will be buying anymore KFC!  I added garlic salt and onion powder, and a little more of all the other ingredients......the result....fabulous!!!  I think next time I'll cut the chicken breasts into strips and use the same flavorings for chicken strips!  Yum!

Only thing I would change would to up the garlic flavor.  Next time I'll try adding some minced garlic in the breadcrump mix.  I also added some garlic pepper mix, loved the seasonings, so did DH and our son.  I used chicken boneless breasts (that's what I had) and cut them up to be tenders.  Dipped them in the flour/breadcrumb mixture first, then egg then flour again and fried them in olive oil.  YUM.  I ate this with my honey mustard sauce, DH and son was ketchup.  MAde this with good old french fries and of course some carrots for the healthy stuff.  Good quick meal.  I'll try this again for sure, maybe with boneless thighs--cheaper and freeze the rest for DH. He loved the leftovers--although not as crispy but the seasonings were there.  THANKS

It was great.  I let it sit in the buttermilk as suggested by one, for close to 4 hours, with some chopped cloves of garlic resting on each piece of chicken.  When we were ready to cook, I just pulled it out of the buttermilk, garlic and all, and breaded it in the flour, then egg, then bread crumbs and put it straight into a hot pan of canola oil.  It turned out VERY good.  What we had left over we ate the next day over some spaghetti pasta and Alfredo sauce.  Just as good the second day as the first.  I'd even reccommend it cold.  It paired well with a Broccoli-Rice Casserole dish found on this site.

This was a great recipe. This was my first time every making fried chix. I did make some of my own Modifications which are as follows:
3tsp Garlic Powder
1tsp chili pepper
substitued milk for buttermilk

I did the chix 2 ways to see what cooked better 2 pieces i fileted and the other 2 i simply removed the fat. Both came out great but the ones that i filleted cooked faster. I used Progresso Italian Sytle bread crumbs and added some Mrs dash Italian Medley substituted the pepper for mccormics new Peppercorn Medley grinders; used 1tsp. Anything i did not meantion i followed by the recipe all and all came out very crispy and was delisious. Fed some to my neighbors kids and they loved it

If you want to make this absolutely delicious then omit the flour. The breading is much more flavorful without the flour and it adheres to the chicken better. Amazing taste!!!

This breading recipe is my go-to for fried chicken breasts and even fish fillets. However, I make one change. I add 1/2 cup of panko breadcrumbs to breading mixture to make it a little crispier. (So in all, I mix up the following for the breading: 2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/2 c. unseasoned bread crumbs, 1 c. flour, AND 1/2 c. unseasoned panko breadcrumbs.) Even my 3-year-old picky eater LOVES to eat the chicken or fish when it's made with this breading. Happy cooking!

I give this a 5. I used sirloin steak and had it cubed by the butcher then used your recipe for chicken fried chicken. My husband was in heaven. Had mashed taters and made some gravy after draining the grease a bit. I think it is good on anything. LOL. Thanks so much for sharing. PS I have also used this on fried dill pickles. Very good

These were okay even though i made the chicken really thin it still took me forever to fry the chicken and it came out way overdone on the outside because the inside wasnt cooked yet, but next time i will oven fry them its way more easier!

Delicious, and so easy to make! It's amazing how far this will stretch your chicken, but it's so good the leftovers don't last long.

I'll try just about anything that has garlic in it and this was so much better than expected.  I'm accustomed to using fresh garlic in most recipes so I wasn't sure if garlic powder was going to give me the garlic flavor that I love so much.  This was REALLY good!  I made it exactly as written and will definitely be adding this one to my Allrecipes binder.

I made this exactly as the recipes states tonight, and everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was the amount of time I cooked it on each side.
I saw that my first batch was getting too dark at five minutes so I cut the cook time per side down to two-and-a-half to three minutes, and they came out perfect!

Followed the recipe as is, but double battered the chicken legs in which I had cut slits, then used a deep fryer at 375 degrees F. The legs were quite meaty and took a little time to cook, but the coating did not burn. Chicken was very moist. We were all amazed that the leg increased in size after the process. Two apiece were more than enough. 

If I had used a less meaty part of the chicken, as the recipe suggests, this would be perfect! If you use meaty portions, be sure to cut into the meat. The coating will mask the cuts.

This recipe is great I would give more stars but their only 5!!!  I follow the recipe just as it was and my family and I love it.  The next time I will let the milk and eggs set for about a hour or two with the chicken.  The chicken was very moist.  Would not change a thing.

Ok the taste was pretty good. Not that much different then just eating it with breadcrumbs alone though, just had a slight garlic taste. The problem I had with this is I had sooooo much extra egg & milk mixture and dry mixture that I had to throw out. I followed it exactly as-is maybe I shouldnt taken some advice from the reviews. I probably won't make this again

I liked this but wasn't in love with it. My 5 year old liked it alot. It was just to much garlic for me. I will try a couple different things next time (I always like to fix the recipe as is the first time) and see if I can't make it a little better for our household.

Very good! turned out nice and crispy, flavorful and moist.  Very garlicy, but we like that!  I served the chicken with mashed potatoes, country gravy and corn.  My husband raved and has been asking for it again.  Next time I will try oven frying, as I have a hard time making such *naughty* food.

What an easy recipe for fried chicken! I used cutlets so I didnt have to pound out the breasts. Also doubled the garlic, paprika and pepper and buttermilk instead of milk.

I don't quite get the rave reviews but...  I tried it exactly as is on the frying, and all it did was burn very easily without cooking.  I gave up trying that and just decided to use some spray stuff in a skillet, turn the temp to low, cover it, and just let it cook.  That worked and it was OK.  But tasted like nothing.  And just due to hassle factor I don't really want to try it again with more garlic.  Just seemed like a waste of my time.  (It was edible so at least it wasn't a waste of food.)

The first time I made this recipe, I followed directions exactly, and my husband enjoyed it all right. The next time I made it, I added minced garlic and hot sauce (Sriracha) to the egg and milk mixture. I also added a little extra garlic powder to the flour/breadcrumb mixture. This time, my husband couldn't stop raving about it. I also used skinless/boneless chicken thighs, which takes much less time to cook. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I just made this recipe and it was very good! I think the chicken may need to be cooked a little longer so the breading is little more crispy but other than that it was great! Thanks!

good (3.5 stars), nothing extraordinary.  I made a gravy to put over the chicken.  I'm glad I did because otherwise the chicken would have been too bland for our liking--we like big, bold flavours.  Overall a basic recipe that can be easily altered to suit your family's taste.

If using drumsticks, make sure to boil the chicken first to cut the fry time (thus avoiding overcooking).  Very good, my family loved it!

This breading was perfect. It stayed nice and crisp. Definately a keeper. Just make sure to salt it after it is done cooking.

excellent! I altered it slightly but not much. I didn't have bread crumbs so I put Club Crackers (20) and 1/4 cup oats (need fiber!!) in the food processor with the spices and ground them until they were fine (I added just bit of crushed red pepper too). In the egg mixture I added a dash of Cumin (because I love cumin in eggs). I let the chicken breasts marinate in a little balsamic vinegar for a few hours prior to cooking and I fried in my deep fryer (its easier and doesn't set my smoke detectors off) for 7 minutes at 375 degrees. I'm finishing it right now but I had just a taste of the one that came out first and it was fantastic. I'll update with my husbands response later.

This was great! I followed exactly except I pounded chicken first, and I also put it in the fridge about 30 min. after I breaded it as another reviewer suggested. I don't even like fried chicken and I enjoyed this = )

Thumbs up from the whole family-even my picky son! I doubled the flour/bread mix & egg mix because I had 6 HUGE chicken breasts-the recipe, as written, would have been just enough for all 6, I think.

Yum! I fried it in olive oil I had been letting some sliced garlic brown in and it was great. I served with Caesar salad and now have a Chicken Caesar salad combo to rival the restaurants. Thanks!

Great!  Tastes like Runza chicken strips to us.  Fabulous flavor on the outside, and the chicken was tender on the inside.  I did use Crisco rather than oil to fry them.

it's perfect... i normally dont like fried chicken breast... love it baked with the right stuff but never fried... but this recipe.. it's juicy and tender and scrumptious... i double dipped in the egg wash and batter instead of just doing the single layer.... my husband loves it... i love it...also i didn't have any garlic powder so i just used garlic salt.. added a little extra of that than what it called for with just using powder... and didn't add any extra salt.. made gravy out of the drippings to put over mashed potatoes... very nice meal.. thanks!

Good stuff! Added a few more spices and doubled the breading as I double dip. Marinated the chicken first in buttermilk, too. Pounded the breasts to about a half inch thickness and fried for about 6 minutes on each side in my cast iron skillet. We liked it a lot. Thanks!

5 stars isn't enough for this one. WOW!! I used boneless skinless chicken breast and cut it into nice thick strips, followed the recipe perfectly. My 6 yr. old son ate 6 strips and ask if I would make it for lunch tomorrow. My husband raved and I thought it was great. It turned out beautiful, crisp, just plain yummy. Will definetly make again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  So moist and delicious!  My husband and I loved it.  I did omit the garlic powder.  Instead I used 2 big  cloves fresh garlic (pressed).  I also did not have any seasoned bread crumbs, so I used plain bread crumbs with some Pampered Chef Italian Seasoning.

I tweaked this recepie a little.Instaed of frying it I baked it. And Before dipping the chicken in the milk and egg, i seasoned the chicken. Also instead of chicken bresast i used chicken legs. It came out great. Thank you so much. I will be making this again.

LOVED this recipe.  I am an admitted non-fryer.  I always end up doing something wrong.  However, this dish sounded so simple that I had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  My family loved it and begged me to make it again and again.  I used chicken cutlets to save time and changed the garlic to 2 Tbsp.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is fantastic. I have used chicken and cube steak, both are wonderful. Be careful using seasoned bread crumbs, one brand I bought had crushed red pepper in it. I've used plain toasted bread crumbs too and it comes out fine. Finely crushed corn flakes also works in place of bread crumbs.

I really liked the flavor of this, had a very slight kick to it. The only thing I did differently was cook it half the time in the oil and let it get brown on each side, and then I put them in the oven so they would get nice and crispy. I paired it with mashed potatoes and arugula salad. My husband loved it, I'll definitely be making this again.

Yum!  I kept the flour separate, and dredged the chicken in it first, then the egg and milk mix, and then in the spice/bread crumb mix.  It was very good, and easy!  I think I'll try it baked, like another reviewer said.  I'll put it on a rack over a cookie sheet, once the weather is cooler.  This is going into my rotation!

Oh folks, this is incredible.  I made it about 5 hours ago and it was awesome.  As my wife is not big on spices (garlic and paprika) I toned it down a little bit but not much. She never knew it was in there. The mix is quick and simple, and oh so good. I cut my servings down to 2, I put it the deep fryer for about 8 minutes, turning frequently, ~ make sure you pound and flatten your chicken breasts. The egg and flour, I kept the same as 4 servings and triple-dipped. Egg, flour, let sit for 4-5 minutes in the flour, (be sure and cover every inch) egg, flour, let sit 4-5 min in the flour, and repeat. So Awesome ! Thank you TANAQUIL for this recipe !!!  I would submit a photo except it's all gone !

This recipe is a staple (albeit monthly) in our home. I follow her instructions to a 'T' except, I use; garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, "a lil" poultry seasoning, salt and pepper(both regular in flour and egg mixtures and lemon on the chicken),and I use those seasonings in my flour and bread crumb mixture, on my chicken breasts (both sides), and my egg and milk mixture. De-freakin-lightful!!!!

Fantastic. Made just as instructed (except I changed the garlic powder from tsp to TBSP). IT was amazing. All 4 kids loved it and there were NO leftovers. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

This is a keeper! The amount of seasoning in the flour is the key. I used a bit more seasoning than called for and used Panko crumbs. I did the flour/egg/Panko and put the chicken in the fridge to set for an hour. The chicken was browned and put in a 350 oven while I pulled the rest of dinner together(15 minutes). Next time I will just serve after frying because it lost a *bit* of the crunch but nothing major. 
So good! For the second time in a week and with allrecipes chicken dishes, my husband said, "You can fix that again anytime!"
Thanks, Tanaquil!

Wow, fantastic!  My entire family loved it!  I used chicken breast tenders and we dipped them in our favorite sauces.  I did use a tablespoon of garlic powder, as recommended.  Definitely will be making this again!

I changed the recipe a bit, using what I had on hand. I used pancake flour instead of flour, no paprika, 2TBL of garlic powder, and crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. It turned out AWESOME!

So easy to make & I love it! I don't have an electric skillet and cooking mine only took 3 mins each side. (Used really thin pieces of skinless/boneless breasts). 

Came out juicy on the inside, but not crispy enough on the outside. Still loved it though!

DELICIOUS!! My 7 yr old daughter LOVED this chicken!  I added more of all the dry ingredients to the bread crumb/flour mixture than the recipe asked. I also added fresh garlic to the oil in the pan. My pieces were thick, so I cooked them on high heat for the first 5 min, and then lowered the heat as they cooked for another 7-10 min.   VERY EASY! Definitely a new family favorite!

Very good, but a little bland for me. Next time I will double the seasonings, then it will be awesome!  Rating it a 5 assuming additional seasoning :)

This sounded like a very good recipe, but I really didn't get the garlic taste and they turned out somewhat soggy.  I believe that my grease wasn't hot enough because I tried to do in a regular fry pan instead of an actual griddle w/ temperature control.

My first ever fried chicken and my family all enjoyed the flavor.  I do need to work out the oil temperature a bit though becuase my breading was very dark brown by the time the chicken was cooked.

This didn't have much flavor to it.  Also, it seemed to make a TON of coating - way more flour than needed (and I made nuggets with 4 chicken breasts and barely used half of it).  So either scale the spices way up or scale the flour way down.  The batter did stick to the chicken pretty well.

We really enjoyed this recipe very much.  I wish I had noticed that it was recommended that we use 2 TBSP garlic powder instead of 2 tsp. as printed, but it was still delicious.  I made a chicken gravy to go with it and will defintely make it again in the near future.  I think I'll also add dill as mentioned in another review.  This was a quick, simple and delicious recipe.

Very nice chicken recipe. I like it because it is a nice addition to a salad or with potatoes and I just personally like garlic. Will make again.

Even my extremely picky roommates loved it. "Oh boy!" The other one was speechless, because her mouth was full of chicken. This recipe made a lot and we really enjoyed it. However, for the sake of our hearts, it will be a treat to enjoy only rarely.

It might be that I don't know how to properly fry chicken, but mine was so greasy I had a hard time eating it. Took quite a long time to make. I might try this recipe again, but if I do I will definitely bake it and not fry.

Great chicken. I followed someone else's review, and marinaded the chicken in buttermilk and salt, garlic and papriks for a night. They turned out very juicy on in the inside. I took these to a picnic, and people liked them, but the coating had gone a bit soft. Next time, I'll try eating them straight off the stove!

I loved the taste of this chicken. As suggested by another reviewer, I soaked it in buttermilk for a few hours. I baked this after browning it on both sides in the pan. I had problems with the breading not sticking to the chicken.  Next time I will try dipping in dry ingredients, then wet, and then dry again.

This was so good my boyfriend and I ate every last drop! I did use chicken tenders instead of breasts and I added some Tonys seasoning. I served it with another recipe from this site. It was mashed potatos with sour cream, chives, cheese, crumbled bacon, and a little bit of bacon grease! Also served with a cold beer.

This dish hit the spot tonight! I used corn flake crumbs instead of seasoned bread crumbs, only added 1/2 cup of flour, Mrs. Dash and a little Italian seasoning. I soaked my chicken for 24 hours, then pounded thin. I was out of eggs, so after consulting the Recipe Exchange, I dipped my milked cutlets in flour, milk, then the crumb mix. I *let the meat sit for 20 minutes* before pan frying. DELISH!!!! I had a few small pieces of chicken that broke off when pounding, and I think those tasted better than the large thin chicken breasts. If your oil is at the right temp (around 350), cutlets thin, and space around the meat, the cook time noted is spot on.

Awesome recipe! I absolutely love this chicken.  I change a couple of things: I changed the flour to 3/4 cup and used whole wheat flour, I also used triskits instead of bread crumbs and it was sooooo good.  I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

Very good.  Chicken stayed moist.  I tripled the garlic and it still could have used more flavor.  I recommend adding other seasonings as well.

This is a great way to put some taste into chicken breasts.  I did make some changes..I marinated it in buttermilk like suggested by some others.  the coating I used was flour, plain bread crumbs, pepper, Tastefully simple seasoned salt and Tastefully simple Bacon Bacon. I don't sell it, this is not a sales pitch, but the slight bacon taste was great!!  I did the egg wash and breading and let it sit for 1/2 just like Emeril says to do with any coating..stays on better in the oil.

It's a good recipe that you can change to your own taste. I marinated the chicken in buttermilk ranch dressing which turned out really good, the only thing I notices is that when I washed the dressing off the chicken and then put it in the egg mixture and then bread crumb mixture the coating stays on better. But the taste was great.

I couldn't taste the garlic at all in this recipe.  The texture/crispiness was good but it was flavorless!  I even added extra Italian spices.  Next time I would put in 3-4 teaspoons garlic

This was delicious! My husband and daughter loved it - the chicken was moist on the inside and flavorful with a nice crunch on the outside!

In search of the best fried chicken recipe...tried this one, it is VERY good.  My family thought it could use a little more spice, but it came out crispy and juicy just like they like it!

This recipe was fool proof and delicious!  Like some others suggested, I marinated my chicken breasts in salt water to add flavor.  The crust was perfect and crisped up nicely!  I will make this again and again!

my family thought this was good, but nothing special.  it was lacking in flavor (and i added extra garlic).  the coating did stick very well to the chicken which was nice but other than that, i don't think i would make this again without adding a lot more seasoning!!

This was awesome!  The only thing I did different was to use chicken tenderloin strips.  Because I had some buttermilk that was expiring I soaked the chicken strips in the buttermilk for about an hour before cooking.  I drained the buttermilk and then coated the strips with the flour mixture.  I did not use the milk and egg.  Either way  I'm sure the flavor would be great.  Made terrific gravy with the drippings!

At first, I used chicken, and my husband said 'mild taste'. Since there was leftover of the ingredients, I dipped it with fish fillet and my husband loves it! I also made gravy out of the ingredients to go with the fried fish fillet. It was delicious and I definitely will do this again.

This was an awesome dish.  It was easy to make and my whole family loved it, (even my 17-month-old). The mouthwatering flavor left us wanting more and it has a slight crispy texture.  We thought we'd need to put some kind of sause, dressing or gravy on it but after one moist bite, we realized, the chicken was all we needed.  I will make this recipe again, for sure!

Wow!!!  The only thing I did was double dip and double dredge and turned out amazing!  My teenager said this was the best fried chicken I ever made and 2nd to Cracker Barrel...just needed some white gravy ;)  Entire family raved.  Thank you for sharing! (As a side note, I only used enough oil to coat the bottom of my pan, maybe even less than a half cup.)

Made this gluten free-ish by replacing the flour with 1/2 c oat flour and 1/2 c corn meal.  Used crumbled up oat biscuits for the bread crumbs.

With a stronger spice like cayenne, a little more salt and lemon this recipe is still just okay. I used thinly sliced chicken breast so it cooked quickly and thoroughly. I would eat it when I'm in a hurry because its quick and easy to make but I would definitely not eat its on its own, maybe with potatoes or boiled vegetables. *Update: I made this a few times and it keeps getting better.

I liked this recipe and before reading through reviews I added more of the spices than called for, a teaspoon didn't seem like much for 1 cup of flour.  I had flavored bread crumbs, but decided to use plain instead and the taste was just right.  Didn't want to much seasoning and it was a perfect taste.  Thanks!

This was excellent!! Surprisingly, I didn't have any egg, so I used milk and a bit of sour cream. Just enough to get the breading to stick. Had a lot of flavor and very tender. Everyone loved it, even my picky little ones. Will add to the rotation.

Yummy!  I wasn't completely keen on the seasoning, but I loved how well the bread stayed on compared to our usual way, and the crispiness of it was perfect.  I think I would use plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned ones next time and cut back on the garlic a bit (original poster said it was supposed to be 2 tbls not tsp, but I think next time I'd try tsp).  We cut up chicken into large pieces to be more like chicken fingers and made a creamy gravy from the drippings.

Followed directions added 1 Tbs of garlic. Did not have paprika, so added more pepper, used sea salt. EXCELLENT! I cut chicken into strips to make it easier to handle. Thank you for the recipe.

This was not good - very lacking in flavour (I also added more garlic powder and minced garlic and still it was missing something). Even the texture was off. Sorry, this was a real miss at our table.

Great! The main problem I found was that there was way too much breading for 4 chicken breast halves. It could probably be halved to save wasting ingredients.

First time frying chicken and this was delicous. Didn't pound chicken but it was fine. Used Mom's country gravy recipe and put that on top. Husband said it was the best thing I ever made. Will be making again.

Not sure if it was me or the recipe, I followed it exactly except I did strips. It was good, but not something that I would rave over.  I will try again, and if its better next time i'll know it was me. LOL If not then I will keep looking.

It was pretty good.  My hubby liked it a lot more than me.  I used chicken legs and think it would have been better on some thin chicken breasts.  Will try it again that way.

We're from Kansas, and we changed up the recipe by adding a chicken stock to the egg/milk mixture and adding chicken rub in the flour breading. Our breading came out perfectly after we double-breaded the chicken breast and we accompanied the dish with a simple rice pilaf and parmesan-garlic asparagus. Simply delicious!

I tried this recipe tonight and followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 TBS garlic powder and accidentally added 1 TBS of smoked paprika but otherwise used the other ingredients per recipe. Also, I fried just until light brown and crispy, then baked at 375 for 15 minutes. It turned out awesome! Next time I will use the 1 tsp paprika as called for but will keep the 1TBS garlic powder. Very good recipe, I will use again.

Wow...was this ever a hit at this house!!!! My hubby is a HUGE fan of chicken fried steak...that is what he orders everytime we go out to eat. He is not a big 'chicken' fan but he LOVED this one! I followed the recipe as is other than I ran out of garlic powder making a side dish with this, so instead of using salt and garlic powder I just used garlic salt. The breasts were thick, so instead of pounding them out, I just cut them in half length wise. I made a gravy to top it off. This will be requested many times at this house....I have a feeling! I myself, also enjoyed this meal thouroughly!!!

This was a tasty and easy recipe. I do think it needed a little more flavor, but overall it was still pretty good. The only change I made was that I made "nuggets" instead of cutlets (my toddler loved them!).

The chicken had great flavor and a nice crisp crunch to the skin. I was also able to use the leftovers to make a completely new meal which is always a plus.

I am going to give this 5 stars. My family gobbled it right up! I wasn't sure because I normally bake my chicken... don't too much frying but this was really good! I served with sauteed potatoe sour cream pierogies with fried onions and steamed brussel sprouts... I made it pretty close to recipe except I added some extra garlic and minced onion and some parmesan cheese in the flour/breadcrumb recipe. Thanx for the recipe... it was a nice treat!!

This was great I did not change a thing I rarely find a chicken breading that let's the moistness stay inside this was great and a keeper for me and I passed it along so Kudos to you thanks for sharing this. Next time I will oven bake this I prefer that over frying in skillet.

I have made this several times and love it.  It's quick if you pound the breasts thin (put them in a ziploc bag and take out some aggression with a pan ... LOL ) and easy.  My kids love it, too.  I go heavy on the pepper and garlic.  
Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband, who doesn't like chicken, likes this recipe. Instead of pounding the breast thin, I slice the breast lengthwise so there is two thinner pieces (same width) It cooks fast, maintains it's texture (you don't end up with a pressed/pounded chicken patty) and it cuts easily. I also add a little extra garlic powder, and I discovered that a teaspoon of onion powder really adds extra flavor (I accidentially added it thinking it was garlic powder), and I used an even amount of seasoned bread crumbs and flour.  I have even halved my thin sliced breasts, and it makes the best fried chicken strips (just like at restaurants) which my son loves to put in dinner/french rolls and eat like little sandwiches.  You can't go wrong with this recipe, men and kids love it!

Great recipe.  Like Trish, I used drumsticks as well and found the same problem.  Next time, I'll boil the chicken before too.  I did like the flavours and it was easy to make as well.

Followed recipe as written...and I didn't care for these.  I just thought there wasn't much flavor.  The two people I cooked dinner for seemed to like them, and I'm not saying they were bad.  It just didn't live up to my expectations based on the reviews.

Great recipe!  Hubby made this tonight, it was delicious.  He added 2 Tbsp. McCormick 'Roasted Garlic & Herb' Seasoning. Otherwise followed exactly - except cooking times. It takes longer than 5 minutes per side - around 10-15 with a bit lower heat, so it will cook thoroughly inside and not burn coating (we were frying thighs). Thanks, Tanaquil, for a great recipe.

This recipe is just like my "chicken fried chicken" recipe. It is so tender and crispy and juicy. I tend to make this about once a month or so, this is my boyfriends favorite dish, he would eat it everynight if I let him.
I make mashed potatoes, gravy,peas and corn with this "hearty stick to your ribs" meal. 

UPDATE 5/2/08
I made this again last night and it was delicious!! My only complaint was that I cooked them too long they were a little dry. But that was my fault, not the recipes. You can even change this up a little bit by using the same ingredients but in a different order.
Coat the chicken in seasoned (to your liking)flour, then dredge in the egg/milk wash, then coat with the bread crumbs, then cook as usual in hot oil. You can even double dip them in the egg then the breadcrumbs for an extra crunchy coating.

This was so delicious.  However, I added some walnuts for some crunch and some diced jalapeno for a little kick!  I paired this with a leafy salad composed of romaine lettuce, grape tomatoes, shaved Parmesan cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  My husband says that this is now his favorite dinner.

This was awesome! I only had regular bread crumbs, so I lightly seasoned them myself with onion powder, garlic powder, and garlic salt. I served the chicken topped with Litehouse Jalapeño Ranch  My whole family enjoyed this recipe. Thanks so much for posting!

My family loved this recipe, even my picky 6 and 4 year old daughters. The only thing I chaged was I did double dip starting with egg, than flour and then dippeed in egg again and flour. I also cooked them in butter versus oil.I made gravy from the grease and will for sure make this recipe again!!!!

Instead of using chicken breast, I used chicken thighs and the fried chicken is amazing everytime! The thighs are much jucier than breasts.

I thought they were delicious. My family also enjoyed the dish. (even my oldest child who doesn't usually like meat or poultry) I used 2 boneless, skinless breasts. I soaked my chicken for 1/2 hr in vanilla half & half before cooking.  The only thing I will try next time is to replace the garlic powder with some fresh garlic to kick up the taste.

My husband loved this recipe! I've made 4-5 times and so far so good. Really tasty, the only complaint is that I usually have too many bread crumbs left over. Other than that it's a keeper!

Used about 30 saltines.  Reduced salt to 1/2 tsp.  1 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp pepper.  Try bread crumbs instead of saltines next time, but crackers were an okay substitute

Excellent, the flavor just pops. I added more garlic and precooked my chicken partially as recommended by others and it was delicious. I also used Itailian bread crumbs... I will be making this again.

Very simple and fast recipe. I cooked the chicken in 400 degree oven for about 3-4 minutes before dredging it, and then cooking it in the skillet. In the skillet, 5 minutes on each side was perfect, so you may want to cook it just a bit through before hand (you don't want the batter to burn...which I think would have happened if I left it in the skillet any longer). I found that a bit more garlic would be welcome, as the flavor was subtle. Also, I did not have any paprika.  It was okay without it, but I think the additonal spice would be welcome.

Ran out of bread crumbs so I used a bag of instant potato's. Key to crispy is definitely heating the oil to 375, but also letting the chicken "rest" after dredging.

So far the only fried chicken my kid will eat next to nuggets, great recipe!

12/22/07 update.....we have been frying chicken using this recipe since I got it off recipes.com in Nov.  One thing we have done was to also use minced garlic.  After you dredge the chicken in the egg wash simply roll it in scattered minced garlic (on a saucer or bowl) then roll in the flour mixture.  It just adds another kick of garlic and is simply delicious.

This was the best chicken I have ever fried!  It was so good that I came home today and fried some more! We used drumettes instead of breasts. They came out perfect!!! You can't go wrong. The recipe is too simple. If you mess this up then you simply cannot cook. We will fry chicken this way from now on. Thanks for sharing!!!

i cant believe this recipe has so many positive reviews. this is my first negative review, i followed the recipe to a -T-....the chicken looked like , and the breading was cracking and falling off. i used a whole cut-up bird so i had portions of all cuts. i honestly cant believe how this is the top fried chicken recipe. i had a cast iron skillet and everything.very very disappointing.....

This was a pretty good recipe (although heavy and deep-fried) I suggest if you want to make something fun and simple for the kids and husband, make this recipe as chicken strips (like chicken fingers.) Also for dipping sauce use a Sweet Chili Sauce (Chinese style)....Also when I made it I did bread crumbs & Flour separate (as other reviews suggested). I added additional spices (to taste). I added crushed chili peppers as well (for added spiciness). I pre-boiled the chicken so the frying wouldn’t take as long and for a healthier touch I used whole wheat flour. Over all…this is a good simple recipe...Enjoy!

This was my first attempt to make fried chicken and it was a success!  I can't believe how easy it is.  It was really good, too.  I'm not really used to eating foods that greasy, but I have to admit, once in a while this makes for a pretty nice treat.  I used chicken breasts that had bones, doubled the garlic and added only half the milk called for.  I dipped into the flour, then into the egg, then into the flour again.  I used a cooking thermometer and waited until the internal temperature was 180F, because uncooked meat/poultry terrifies me.  I also used chili powder instead of paprika, and next time I'll double it to 2 tsp.  I added 1/2 tsp curry powder, too.  I like it spicy.  Last thing: I added a tsp of sugar to get the sweetness I was looking for.  Excellent!

This was a simple and wonderful chicken recipe.  My 7 year old niece came to visit us and I made this for dinner one of the evenings.  She told me she hated chicken and wanted something else.  I told her she will like this one.  She tried it and is now hooked on chicken. (Well at least this recipe)  She wants me to make it AGAIN tomorrow!!!  We all loved it.

FIVE STARS! It was excellent... Great comfort food! Chicken had nice flavor, crisp breading and moist on the inside!I made gravy from about a 1/4 of the drippings. Went great over the chicken and mashed potatoes! YUMMY!

Ladies at a recent luncheon were all talking about this recipe, so I tried it. Yumm-O! I prefer Panko, so used that, increased the garlic to our liking and as I always do, parboiled the chicken to decrease grease and cut down on cooking time. The coating was crispy and flavorful and the meat was moist and tender. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very nice recipe.
Instead of garlic powder, I used real minced garlic.  I did not have seasoned bread crumbs, so I used plain and added fresh basil and dried thyme.  It was wonderful!
I found the breasts took alittle longer than what the recipe said.
Very good and will definitely make again!

This turned out really good.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used some cajun seasoning to season plain bread crumbs.  Oh, and I did follow others advise and I used fresh garlic.

This was wonderful.  I used it to coat boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I had pounded thin then deep fried to make chicken strips.  The only change I made was a little onion powder into the mix.  I'm making this again for our superbowl party today.

Great fried chicken!! My 1-1/2 yo is the pickiest eater and he gobbled down a drumstick. I did use 2 tablespoons of garlic powder as some others and the op suggested. And thanks to Trish for her tip on boiling drumsticks before frying--I know it made the difference (I wasn't sure how long to boil for so I went with 10 minutes).

VERY delicious!  I did use the recommendations of prior reviewers--added more garlic and used lawry's seasoning.  I also browned the chicken and finished cooking on a broiler pan from another recommendation.  The chicken breading was crispy and tasty--my husband said I could make that for him every week!

This was pretty good. I used garlic salt, instead of powder and then just omitted the salt. We like heat, so, I added chili pepper flakes... and used Italian bread crumbs. I used chicken legs... so, I recommend cooking them in the oven first, then deep frying... if you go the other way, they wont be as crispy.

I made some changes, but this is a good place to start. I pan fry the chicken for about 10 min per side, then I bake the chicken for 25-30 min, or until no longer pink. Otherwise, my chicken just burns because I dont have an electric skillet. Anyways, good recipe, I just don't have the skills to perfect it I think.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and found it just okay.  Next time I will cut in half the amount of bread crumbs and flour, and hope that helps.  If it's called garlic chicken, I want to know there is garlic in there, and with this much breading and flour I could not.  Not bad, but far from great.

This one is definately a keeper.  My husband loved it.  I took the suggestion of others and increased the amount of garlic.  Also, I only had plain bread crumbs on hand, so I added a touch of seasoned salt.

I would say this recipe was very good.  It wasn't anything spectacular but still tasty.  To add a little flavor to the oil, I fried some fresh garlic cloves before cooking the chicken in.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  My kids really liked it.

This was great. The only changes I made was to use soy milk instead of the regular do to dairy allergy, and 3 tsp of powdered garlic. There was enough breading to bread six thin cut chicken breasts and four vegetarian "chicken" cutlets and there was still planty left over.Served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed sugar snap peas.MMMmmmm. If your tired of the same old fried chicken this is definitely worth a try. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great way to make a boring chicken breast that the whole family will eat!  I used 1 cup breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup flour and it was perfect.  I also sliced the chicken breasts into cutlets by slicing them length-wise.  I fried them in just a cup of canola oil and baked them to finish them-great!

Myself, and three grown men, loved this!!  I doubled the garlic and added more spices to my taste.  I served this with The Best Slow Cooker Creamed Corn from this site.  I browned, then put in the oven to let the grease drip off.  Served with white country gravy mix poured over.  Delicious!

I used this with split breasts and baked it in the oven like one of the other reviewers.  I also didn't strictly follow the amounts for the spices - I used more than what was called for.  You have to be careful with how much batter you used if you bake this (I used too much and some didn't brown), however, I've learned from my mistake and will definitely try this again!  The flavor was very good and the chicken was moist....definite keeper!

This was pretty good. I might of gotten my oil too hot - outside cooked up too quickly and the inside was not done yet.

Alrecipes is turning my husband into a CHEF! Thank you!!! He found this recipe, bought the ingredients and started cooking. The meal was the best, the chicken was incredibly tasty and moist and the breading remained crispy. We all enjoyed it tremendously.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used cornmeal.  Very tasty and tender chicken.

I made this as the recipe called for  it was just ok the breading is heavy and outdated good for 1980

I made this a second time with one change instead of use if the bread crumbs  I went with Panko style bread crumbs and I added 1/4 tsp of  cayenne pepper For a hint of spice without overwhelming my kids   Doing it this way it turns out lighter crisper 
Less greasey  with a better flavor profile

This chicken had pretty good flavor. I didn't use as much oil as the recipe called for - I did more of a pan fry - but it still tasted great!

My family loves this fried chicken.  All that oil is not necessary.  I use a non stick skillet and perhaps 2 T of coconut oil.  Also it makes way too much breading so I usually half it.  This is one of my go to recipes.  So easy and flavorful!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I used 2 huge chicken breasts and sliced them in half to make 4 cutlets. I had plenty of leftover flour and egg/milk mixtures. I will have to remember just to make half of those for 4 cutlets.

I do not understand all the reviews complaining that chicken can't be fried in 15 minutes.  This recipe is for chicken fried chicken, which means a thin cut of meat, breaded or battered then fried, and these ingredients clearly state "skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin." My own chicken was done in maybe 7 minutes, though I did I don't have an electric skillet so I used a deep, heavy bottomed pan on the stove and my trusty thermometer. I did s&p the chicken directly, then coated in the seasoned flour, dipped it in the egg mix, then into the flour again.  I had also followed the note from the submitter stating the garlic powder was meant to be T, not t.  This came out flavorful, crispy on the outside, tender moist chicken on the inside, a big "winner, winner chicken dinner!"

Great recipe! I didn't make precise measurements of the seasoning (just eyeballed it) but it still came out perfect. I was lazy and used a fry daddy instead of pan frying, which I'm sure is worse for my health but it was very effective and easy. This recipe is a keeper and perfect as is.

Like the breading, but ended up baking mine, no time to stand over the stove and healthier. I think it probably came out juicer and stayed together better than what I have been reading about frying it leaves it dry and the crust falling apart.

Oh man, this was SO GOOD! Used about 1/2 the oil and came out just fine. I also used Chicken Tenders instead of breasts and made some chicken fried steak milk gravy with the drippings and served with mashed potatoes. The flavor from the coating was really good, it stuck to the chicken really well. The only thing I'd change is next time I'll add a little cayenne pepper to the coating.

Absolutely delicious! Used 2 Tablespoons/not teaspoons of garlic, used 3/4 cup Panko and 3/4 cup flour, seasoned the chicken with a little Adobe prior to breading and fried in Peanut oil at 350 degrees for 5 minutes a side. Turned out perfect.

My husband is finicky about chicken, but he loved this recipe -- and so did the kids and I. 

I'm glad I read the recipe submitter's note about using 2 Tablespoons of garlic powder, because that is what made this so good! I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground rosemary, as another reviewer suggested. 

What an easy weeknight way to make intensely flavorful chicken! This is going in our family favorites cookbook for sure!

I basically butterflied a chicken breast and followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious.

I made homemade gravy (also from this site) to cover the chicken, and it was a winner! :)

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was good.  I thought that it could use a little more salt.  Other than that, this is a good recipe.  Texture of the breading reminds me of my favorite chicken restaraunt that is closed on Sundays!

I am terrified to fry chicken.  But I finally decided to give it a try.  This recipe was perfect for a beginner.  I felt more at ease frying the smaller pieces of chicken instead of a whole chicken for my first try.  It turned out great and even my picky eaters like them..

Loved how moist on the inside but crispy on the outside they were. I plan to use this recipe a lot.

I halved the recipe but kept the amount of spices the same (basically used half the amount of bread crumbs, flour, milk and chicken called for) and ended up with very moist and flavorful chicken.  I used a piece in a sandwich with swiss, tomato and lettuce and that tasted wonderful too!

This recipe was wonderful! I actually didn't increase the garlic powder like some other reviewers, and it was still great. And the chicken turned out really tender.

Needed more garlic powder, so the flavoring was a little more bland than it should have been. But otherwise, great chicken! Would go great with dijon mustard.

I found this to be quite bland - I used italian style shake and bake crumbs along with kellogs bread crumbs.  I also added an extra 2 tsp of garlic, some cumin, a tsp of chili powder and an extra tsp of pepper and it was still only ok.  Next time, I'm going to add cayenne, another tsp of chili powder and an extra tsp of salt.  This is a good recipe to start with.

This is my first review, and I just have to say, this is a BIG family hit in our house.  since I first tried this recipe, the kids have requested it again and again.  I cut the chicken more into tenders than fillets, but other than that, I follow the recipe.  Thanks for a big hit with my picky eaters1

This recipe was just ok. I will make it again but with some adjustments. I think it was rather bland and I even upped the garlic. Next time I will use some of the suggestions from the other reviews. Flavored breadcrumbs,maybe Italian seasoning,a little more pepper.

This was probably the best chicken I've made in a really long time.  Very very good. It is going in our regular rotation.  I don't keep bread crumbs in the house because of a dairy allergy, but I crushed up some wheat "Toppers" crackers to use instead.  I bet the Garlic and Herb kind would be good, too.  I also marinated in italian dressing for a couple of hours beforehand.  Thanks for posting this!

Your recipe tasted very good for my husband and myself.  I have written on it that next time I should use just one chicken half breast, for him and I.  Because this meal just fills you up fast.  Thank you for the recipe, we sure enjoyed it.

The crust was very light and flavorful. I wish I had read the reviews about using more garlic powder. I love garlic. I made 12 chicken tenders and put them in the deep fryer. I have never cooked fried chicken so fast!

I was not impressed here at all.  This was BLAND.  I did also see the note from the submitter of this recipe that the garlic pwd should be TBSP, not tsp and did use TBSP's.  Still, VERY bland.  I tasted none of the seasonings, besides the flour and breading, not really even much garlic flavor.  The problem is the flour and bread crumbs are way out of proportion for the amount of seasoning listed.  The seasonings just get lost in the dish.  I think by cutting some of the flour/breading and increasing the seasonings a great deal, this will be great!  Sorry I can't give a better review, but I do thank you for sharing!  :)

This was pretty good. It had decent flavor. The key was, of course, to let it rest for awhile before frying. The breading stuck to it like glue and came out really crunchy.

I do like the seasonings in this recipe.  This is something I choose to make from time to time, with a big helping of vegetables on the side.  I love garlic, so the taste is great to me.

I tried this last night only w/ pork chops!  It came out great - my only complaint was that they were SO greasy!  I mean, I expected them to be, but they were even more than I thought.  Delish though, and hubby loved them, too!

This is delicious with gravy!  My husband gave me a thumbs up sign three times while eating and my 9 year old said, "Thank you, Mommy."  I will definitely include this in regular recipes.  Thanks.

I made this for my family and my best friend (who loves food as much as I do) this evening, and everybody scarfed it down! The chicken was moist and delicious. I added a bit more garlic, pepper, and paprika. I also dipped the chicken in flour first, then the egg, and then the garlic/bread crumb mixture. It was really delicious! Thanks for sharing. =)

This was excellent although next time I will double bread it and add more garlic. Served with country gravy and mashed potatoes and it tasted just like at a restaurant.

I thought this recipe was good. Next time, I think I would add some different spices or use breadcrumbs instead of flour and add grated parmesan or something. It just needed a little extra something...Thanks!

Delicious...a BIG hit in my house!  My husband is already planning on having me cook this for several of our friends and family!  I added 2 heaping tsp. of parmesan cheese and used the breading to make chicken parmesan.  Will absolutely make this again!

Wow!!! I would give this more than a 5 star if I could!!! Everyone loved it. Even my 2 year old boy devoured it, and lately its been hard to get him to eat anything lately but he sure loved this. I made this with mashed potatoes, country gravy, and peas....YUMMO!!!!!It reminded me of a meal that cracker barrel would make.
I made this exactly as instructed.
This is definately a keeper in my house!!

i made this as said, but i also took someone else's advice and sat the chicken in buttermilk for about 1/2 hour prior to cooking which made the chicken so tender and juicy. i added a little garlic salt and pepper each time i turned the chicken. my son is not a big eater and he ate his whole piece of chicken as well as sides. my family was really impressed with this recipe!

I used tenderloins, and a skillet with oil. I was running a bit hot, so I only did three and a half minutes on each side. Still, the crust was flavorful, the chicken tender, and the recipe easy. After I was done with making chicken, I popped fresh asparagus into the oil and fried it for three minutes. Great addition!

I'll admit I was a little skeptical, thinking it would turn out a lot like glorified Shake 'N Bake, but this was GREAT!  I followed other reviewers advice and boiled the chicken first, but other than than I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect... thanks!

This was a good change from our usual baked chicked. I added more garlic powder than called for, and also added a couple tablespoons of chopped garlic to the mix.

I often cook chicken,turkey or veal this way, with a few exceptions: I use fresh breadcrumbs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and finely chopped parsley. I don't fry them but use a girdle with a spay of olive oil.The griddle must not too hot or else it with burn. Try and let me know. Chicken brest must not be too high. Cook with a griddle

Great -- I loved the garlic. I did cut down on the salt and pepper by 1/2 tsp each, and added about 1 tsp of Lowry's seasoning salt. Make sure the heat isn't turned up too high -- medium low was hot enough on my stove. Any hotter and the breading will get too dark without cooking the inside of the chicken. Definitely a keeper! Used chicken tenders and put it on a salad, made a dressing of sour cream, lemon juice, hot sauce & bleu cheese. Perfect!

This was a very good, easy recipe. Great when you can't run to the store. Everything needed was already in the cupboard.  I would definitely make this again, although I would use fresh garlic as one other member suggested.

Hi, this is my first time reviewing a recipe and I must say this is the ONLY dish that my boyfriend and I have agreed on in TWO years. We have very different pallets and I like things more flavorful and he likes this bland. However, this was the perfect blend for both of us. The only thing I did different was add some fresh garlic and a tsp. of cayenne. Served it with some mashed potatoes and chicken gravy. Will FOR SURE be making it again!

I was looking for a quick recipe with stuff that I already had and I came across this recipe. My husband is always a fan of chicken fried chicken so I knew I couldn't go wrong with this. He loved it!  It's a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully.  Next time I'm going to take someone else's suggestion and marinate the chicken in buttermilk before breading/cooking just to see what kind of flavor that brings out!  (I usually have buttermilk on hand but I didn't the night I made this). I served it over mashed potatos and topped it with country style gravy and had buttery garlic aparagus as a side.

I have fried chicken less than 10 times in my life. I am not very good at it. I thought this was my best attempt ever. I think it would have been almost perfect if I had followed the directions and pounded the meat thin.  Anyway, I soaked the breasts in buttermilk and minced garlic for several hours. I don't know if it did anything but I thought it was a good idea. I pretty much followed the recipe. The breading was good and had a nice garlic flavor. I think I would have enjoyed the dish more if I had made gravy.

This recipe is excellent.I made this recipe this evening for dinner for my family of 7. Everyone loved it! Even the pickiest of eaters. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The only changes that I made was that I added a little bit of seasoning salt and a little more garlic. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Amazing!!! I took some advice from others and fried the chicken first and baked it in the oven at 375 for 25 mins. 
I also added more paprika, but next time I'll try some chili pepper flakes or something to spice it up a bit.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make a couple of changes. I used 3/4 cup each of seasoned bread crumbs and flour. I added 1/2 tsp. of onion powder and used hot paprika for added flavor. Turned out pretty good. I had two HUGE chicken breasts (I mean these birds must have nearly been the size of small turkeys!) so I started out as if to butterfly them but kept going to slice them completely in half, making two breasts into four pieces. Worked great, and was done in the stated time of 5 min. per side.

This was very good.  The only modifications I made were to add more spices - I put in a little of everything, but mine needed salt (I didn't measure salt and pepper, so I might not have used a full tsp).  I used thin-sliced chicken breasts and the meal was very fast and very simple.  I will make this again, maybe with chicken fingers.  One note: next time I might try dipping and dredging a few times to get a thicker breading.

Very good chicken fried chicken recipe. I used boneless chicken breast and pounded flat with mallet. I browned in oil and then place on a baking rack and finished in oven. Crust was very crispy. The only thing that I will change in the future is to add more spices to it, other than that very good.

THANK YOU! This recipe kicks butt. My husband loved it and it was so easy. They only thing I did different was use buttermilk instead of regular milk. The chicken was super moist, no knife needed. It's already been added to dinner rotation.

This was great.  It was really good.  When I served it, my husband said, "When did you learn to cook fried chicken?" and when he tried it, he was really impressed.  This was fantastic, I had no problems with the breading.  It has been my experience that extremely hot oil, helps the coating stay on.  I will be making this every time we have a fried chicken craving!!

This was actually very good! I, too, added some adobe to the recipe and browned it quickly in oil, then baked it at 350 for 15 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

Folks, it sounds like you may be using too much milk/egg and not enough flour.  Not sure.  Fried checken should not be rubbery on the outside.  And I have never had to pre-boil/pre-cook chicken before frying.  Tweak the recipe and see if it helps.  The basic recipe for fried chicken is that you wash your chicken, pat it dry....if you like (not really necessary as long as the chicken is not dripping wet), next season your chicken with whatever spices you like and then you put flour in a bag, drop each piece in the bag to coat evenly.  The coating does not have to be extra thick. Drop the chicken in hot oil and let cook.  Simple.  Many varitions to one simple recipe.  Happy frying folks.

I added a little onion powder to the dry mix and used 3-cheese breadcumbs, and then dredged it before and after the egg mixture. When it finished frying I tossed the chicken in the broiler with some Italian blend shredded cheese, and then served it atop spaghetti and sauce.  The other half loved the moist, flavorful chicken, and we have dinner for tomorrow night, too. Next time I'll try adding the minced garlic, or I'll use Old Bay and make tenders.

It was terrific!  A great twist on the chicken fried variety.  We added a little more garlic to ours as we are garlic lovers

This was a great recipe.  I made it with bone-in chicken and boneless.  My family loved it just the same. Will make again!

It was good. Although breading with Italian bread crumbs and a sprinkle of garlic salt would probably get you the same thing.  I liked it, but it's just not anything special.

The chicken came out very moist and good.
I added extra garlic poweder as other reviews had stated to do.
I gave it a four because I thought the chicken coating would be crispier

This was quick and easy, which I love, and it was tasty too! The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I only wish that the 'breading' had been a bit thicker.

We really liked this chicken. The first batch I made I misread the directions and forgot the flour, It was great that way too. Have since made it per directions and loveit! Has more flavor than traditional fried chicken.

Made this for a group of friends.  VERY simple - great for casual entertaining because it is easy and fast.  A discerning guest said it was just possibly the best chicken she had ever had.  I think I would have to agree.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I've always  stayed away from frying chicken & letting more experienced people do it. Because my husband & I prefer boneless breasts, I used 4 & followed the recipe exactly. I was amazed at how wonderfully juicy & tender the chicken was!! I fried for about 4-1/2 to 5 minutes each side & it really turned out tasty. We used the leftovers for chicken sandwiches the next night & they were equally as tasty. Thanks so much!

It was absolutely...delicious, my mom said it was "DELICIOUS", my fiance gives it ten stars. The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of garlic to the egg and milk. I served it with mashed potato, steamed broccoli, mixed vegetable and gravy.

Delicious moist chicken! It took me a little less than 5 minutes per side to fry them up. Decreased the peppper and used chile powder instead of paprika. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I will definetly be making this again!

The boneless chicken breasts were superb.  The coating was a perfect combo of bread crumbs,flour & seasonings and this coating/breading didn't soak up the grease when you fried it.  I had some bone-in thighs that I also cooked this way, I found that they were not as flavorful as the flattened out breasts (flavor didn't penetrate the meat).I will try this coating the next time I make chicken fried steak.  Good recipe...thanks.

This is a good, basic recipe for frying up chicken breasts.  The ratio of bread crumbs to flour is just right.  It fried up nice and crispy without being mushy or falling off.  I would make this again.

This was enjoyable.  I took a previous suggestion and added cayanne (just a dash).  That was too much for my daughter.  Tough for her.  LOL  But, this is one that I will have to remember.

Taking advice of some other comments for this recipe I enhanced it with additional garlic powder and added chili powder and cayenne powder.  Unfortunately it wasn't enough for this recipe to standout.  My wife thought it was just okay, although my daughter liked it better.  I thought it still lacked distinction.  It's worth only three starts at best..........sorry.

This recipe is very easy and very yummy.  I withheld the paprika, simply because I didn't have any, added some Cavenders, extra garlic powder, and used course ground black pepper!  It's a very pretty dish, and the pepper made a pretty difference.

Very tasty. I upped the garlic a little, and added a 1/2 tsp of chili powder as well. I also cut my chicken into small cubes, to cut the cooking time a little. The end product was very yummy, my family ate it up. The only problem I had with it is that the coating browns up quite quickly (I had my oil pretty hot at first), and it's hard to distinguish which pieces are fully cooked and which are not. To solve that, I simmered the pieces in gravy after frying, and let them sit for about 10 minutes in the gravy. I was afraid of the chicken becoming soggy, but it was fantastic. :) I will have this again.

I guess I was expecting something that was bursting with garlic flavor, so I was a little disappointed with this chicken. I would have liked a crispier breading. Despite that, my husband and son both enjoyed it, and thought it was a good substitute for our regular fried chicken breasts.

This was pretty good.  I didn't add all the salt and maybe that would have been the difference.  I added all the garlic it called for and I couldn't even taste it.  I was a little dissappointed.  I served it with scalloped potatoes and that added a nice little sauce.  I'd recommend putting the chicken on paper towels to drain some of the oil.  So, I liked it, but I can't say that it was really worth all the effort.  I'll probably make it a couple of times a year...not something that would be put into a meal rotation.  My husband loves fried chicken, so he thought this was a yummy treat!

GREAT!!!  This recipe was very good, my whole family loved it, even my 2 kids ages 5 and 7 not to mention my husband.  I served this with the cowboy potatoes suggested by another poster, stuffing and green salad.  Awesome dinner, and I didn't change a thing!!

My DH and I thought this dish was only okay.  I used two large chicken breasts and pounded them thin, but I used the whole amount of breading ingredients.  We had a little left-over, but not much.  In the end, we felt this chicken recipe lacked flavour.  We couldn't taste any of the garlic, it just tasted like chicken coated in breadcrumbs and fried.  I might try this chicken again but will jazz it up with a little chili powder and more garlic maybe.

My family and I thought it was good. Not spectacular but not bad either. I read the reviews and used three tsps of garlic because most of them thought it needed it. I thought that was a mistake. I will make it again only with the two tsps like the recipe calls for. Hey, pretty good eats. We'll do it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Two enthusiastic thumbs up. Followed the directions completely spice wise but I admit I didn’t beat the breasts down. It didn’t affect the taste at all. They were juicy and so so good. Told my kido they looked like big chicken tenders when they got done. Everyone couldn’t stop talking about how good they were. Crispy outside and just wow. I will reuse this. Made after work and it was done in a snap. Thank you so much for sharing. Highly recommend.

Meh. It was pretty bland, even with garlic olive oil and garlic bread crumbs.  I didn't read until after to use tablespoons of garlic powder instead of teaspoons. Also I'd say closer to 6 1/2 instead of 5 for it to really have a crisp to it.

I added one extra teaspoon of garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I found the chicken took longer than 5 mins to cook on each side, possibly because my chicken breast halves were rather thick.  The chicken was moister than I expected and the fried coating was slightly crunchy with a great flavor.  I will definitely make again.

A great go to recipe. This was my first time making fried chicken and it showed after the rest of the family chose my baked version over it. Wife said it was great but she's on a diet. I seasoned my chicken with a Lawry's poultry seasoning and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Will use it when I have the guys over.

I don't care for chicken breast meat so I used boneless, skinless thighs. I also used real minced garlic as well as the powder. Lots of it! I also know from past experiences  to heat the oil up very slowly on a very low temperature. I'd rather have to wait longer for the chicken to fry up golden with the inside cooked. The outside was nice and crispy. There was no soggy batter. If you really like garlic, though, add real garlic to the dry ingredients. You may have to experiment with the amount depending on your taste.

Since this is such a basic recipe, I tried it for the balance of the spices.  However, very little of those flavors made it to the chicken.  I try to keep my salt level down so I am accustomed to having less salt in my food and still I felt there was not enough salt.  If I try it again I will mix the spices in a shaker and sprinkle them on after the dredging or perhaps try rubbing them into the chicken before the egg dip.

This was one of those easy after work meals with a boring chicken breast made good! We like ours a little spicy, so extra pepper, garlic and paprika. I also used panko crumbs. Thumped the breast with a mallet until even thickness. Served with zucchini noodles and a little dipping sauce.  This will be a redo for sure.

Excellent video  and I actually make my fried chicken this way.  I love Garlic Powder along with Spike Salt Free and Mrs. Dash Table Blend. I don't use quite as much salt though; a quarter teaspoon is plenty for me.  I have high blood pressure. Nothing is plain about this flavor! This is one of my favorite ways to pan fry chicken or oven fry it.

I made this for dinner tonight.  Followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and it was absolutely delicious!   The chicken was a beautiful golden brown, crisp on the outside and not the least bit dry on the inside!  
I'm not very good at frying the various chicken parts, and not only was this easy to prepare, it satisfied my craving for friend chicken.  
I served it with mashed potatoes, peas and even made a delicious gravy!  Green salad rounded out the menu!  
I will be making this more often!

This recipe was okay.  I made it as it is written.  A little bland tasting and the coating was not as crispy as I was hoping it would be.

this recipe was ok, but the length of time to cook the breasts (5 minutes each side) would not be a good option when feeding more than one person, unless you keep the previously fried chicken in the oven to keep warm, and those were soggy by the time they were served.  I don't know about everyone else, but the chicken breasts were quite large when flattened so only had room to cook one at a time.  Cooking for 4 people would take 40 minutes - way too long in our house.

Added some meat seasoning to the chicken and made without using the egg. Turned out decent, but I do want to tweak and play with the recipe some more.

This was very good cut up chicken breast into nuggets/strips and fried in pan with canola oil since it was all i really had, whole wheat bread crumbs, Cajun seasoning instead of garlic powder plus  Italian season and everything else. Loved it!

When I made this recipe, I was on a mission to find the best fried chicken online. This recipe was my 11th high-rated fried chicken recipe. I made this recipe to the tee with one exception. I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, so I used 40% plain breadcrumbs and 60% "pork" Shake n' Bake seasoned coating. The result was incredible. This mistake chicken has continued to be my family's favorite fried chicken.  We chose to make it for our recent family reunion in which I was asked so many times for the recipe, that I emailed it to everyone. You won't be disappointed, but don't try chicken seasoning, it's not as good as the pork.

Most recipes can be changed and added to and taken away to suit your taste buds.  This is a good one.  I used Panko and Sylvia's Seasoning.  I also added some Creole seasoning to give it a little kick.  Everything we have experimented worked great from this basic recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

I liked the seasonings, etc. very much. Using boneless chicken leg meat, I substituted the milk w/ buttermilk substitute (milk w/ lemon juice). If I had started earlier, I would have marinated in the buttermilk for 30 in, or so. No matter. Everyone, liked this alot! Thank You!!

I made this and it was truly delicious. I did not have seasoned bread crumbs, so I just used panko bread crumbs, a little extra garlic powder and a little onion powder. My children asked for seconds. I will definitely make it again.

Made it exactly as instructed. It was very good. I might use this as a base and add more spices as it was fairly simple tasting for how much paprika and garlic was in the mix.

I've tried (really hard) to make fried chicken in the past, but have failed pretty bad.  Today I decided to give it another shot, and I'm so glad that I did! I used chicken breast that I beat, and slices into about  6" pieces. I let the oil get nice and hot before I fried it and it turned out so good! I would compare it to Chick-fil-A, and my husband said over and over how good it was!! Definitely will make it again!

This recipe was delicious. My picky eaters (ages 12 & 9) ate it all up and my husband actually commented on how this was one of my better chicken recipes. I will add this to my rotation.                     I followed recipe except I used egg whites; next time I will try baking  it.

I use the batter for frying chicken all ways.  Legs, thighs and chicken strips.  The kids request them over and over.  My deep fryer has never had so much attention.

My first time truly frying chicken, other than a couple mins each side before baking it. My husband couldn't believe how awesome it came out... Now he wants this multiple times a week lol. I didn't have the full chicken breasts, rather I had the tenderloins... It ended up favorable for me since it cooked faster + I didn't have to worry about burning it. Will make this again.

Delicious!  Imake this very often! I use all I use mostly the same ingredients except I crush a clove of garlic in the egg mix. I do find I have a lot of leftover batter so sometimes I reduce the amount a little.

I fry the chicken but I don't use a cup of oil I just use enough to cover the bottom of the pan. I fry each piece just until brown, then I put them on a cookie sheet and bake them in the oven for about 30-40min at 375 depending on the size of chicken. 

I find this method a little healthier than totally frying. And you can do other things while the chicken is baking.

 I love this recipe because most of the ingredients are things you would have on hand.  This recipe is a real keeper!

This turned out phenomenal. I followed the directions as written, except upped the garlic powder to TBS instead of tsp, per the author of the recipe's recommendation. Also, I used smoked paprika instead of plain. 
I only cooked two chicken breasts, so it really only took 15-20 minutes to cook, as stated. As recommended by one reviewer, after I cooked them on one side for 5 minutes, I turned them over and covered with a lid. The breading was so flavorful and the chicken super moist!

I thought this was very good. I cut my chicken breast in half so it would cook more thoroughly. I also dredged my chicken in the flour first, milk mixture second, and finally in the bread crumb season mix. I read that the original recipe called for two tablespoons of garlic powder instead of two teaspoons so that is what I did and it tuned out wonderful!

This is a fantastic recipe. I used tenderized chicken breast, the kind that looks like cube steak ( only its chicken ) I also made as the update from the author of the recipe indicated, using TBLS and not tsps. The flavor was out of this world. This recipe is a definite repeat and keeper. LOVE IT!

I use this recipe for Chicken Bites, too! I cut boneless chicken breasts to 1' cubes and follow the directions as written. I do use 2-TABLESPOONS of Garlic Powder, as suggested by the author. I fry the cubes for 5 minutes each side. Done to perfection! This is now in our, "Make Often" folder. :>)

Yum this was great. I read the review of the OP & used tablespoon of garlic powder. I added a tad more paprika for flavor & it wasn't overly spicy at all.I also pre dipped in flour before egg wash. Thx!

It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was too salty so maybe less garlic salt and salt. The chicken was very moist though.

Quick and easy recipe for fried chicken. I would've preferred a little more flavor in the breading (maybe more garlic/pepper/salt). Will try again with alterations to see how it turns out!

Glad I looked at the reviews as well and saw the change from teaspoons to tablespoons on the garlic powder as I think you will not taste the garlic at all.  With that adjustment this was terrific.  Perfect blend of flavors without any one overpowering the other.  This is one that will stay in my recipe box!

I burnt this, so that part was my fault, but the breading was extremely bland and it was just tasteless overall.  I don't know why this is called "garlic chicken", it didn't taste garlicy at all.

Also, I followed the number one most helpful review for this recipe and boiled the chicken first.  Not a good plan, don't do that.  Boiling then frying = rubbery chicken, or at least it did in this case.

I did this in the deep fryer and it was delicious! Make sure your chicken is completely thawed though. Mine wasn't and it took about double the time to cook.

I made it exactly as written except for using 2 TBS of garlic powder and it was great.  I used thin cutlets and they were moist and tender.  My son has an eating disorder and he ate two cutlets.  He said it was delicious and asked for it again next week.  It's a keeper!

Make sure to season the chicken with salt and pepper for at least 6 hours before frying it.

Very easy recipe to follow!  I made some sauce using mayo, garlic and lemon to go with it and it was fantastic! It was really delicious!

excellent recipe! I didn't have bread crumbs so I made my own (toasted bread, blitzed in food processor along with the spices in the recipe). I used 1Tbsp of minced garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. 
I flattened the chicken pretty well and double coated everything (breadcrumbs, milk/egg, breadcrumbs). The coating stayed on and tasted great. Next time I will use more garlic and thinking of using crushed corn flakes for second coating to get more crunch.

GLUTEN FREE VERSION
We used cornstarch instead of flour and cornflakes instead of bread crumbs to make a gluten free version.  It turned out WONDERFUL

Works great in the electric skillet! I also doubled the amount of garlic powder, dipped the chicken in egg/milk then flour twice for extra crispy coating and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans, just used a dry mix to make the gravy. I've made it twice now and it was delish! Ended up cooking it for about 10 min on each side, just to be sure it was done - which is no big deal because you can just let the electric skillet do it's thing. Winner!

Turned out great! Could use a little more garlic. I seasoned the chicken breast before dipping them in the egg & milk batter.

Like other users I couldn't taste the garlic and if you want spicy make sure to use cayenne pepper. I doubled the black pepper but couldn't taste it. It's not the juiciest fried chicken I've ever had, only average. I won't be making this again; I'll stick to the way I usually make my fried chicken.

Oh my!!  I made this tonight and I must say it was the best chicken cutlet I've ever had.  I did use tablespoons rather than teaspoons of the spices and used smoked paprika instead of regular.  Threw in a bit of oregano and onion powder (but not really much).  Sooooo awesome.  Many thanks.

I just made this recipe for the first time today and I, along with the people I shared this wish all thoroughly enjoyed it. 
I made some slight alterations to the recipe however, including changing all the spices to their respective quantity of tablespoons. I also added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flakes each. 
I also utilized our fraternities deep fryer and cooked them in that for 3:30 at 350 degrees.

The result was a delicious lightly breaded, moist, and tender treat. The breading was able to crisp and lightly brown while the chicken remained juicy and tender. While I fileted the breasts and then pounded them, a friend decided to cut up a few breasts into chicken tenders. Both were delicious! Also, a side of BBQ sauce led to a great mix of flavors! 

I recommend this recipe as it is an excellent, quick and easy base for making some tasty fried chicken!

Good Recipe, I browned the chicken in a skillet and then baked it for 35 minutes on 375, I also used real pressed garlic in the milk and egg mixture instead of garlic powder in the flour mixture, made garlic and sour cream mashed potatoes and reserved the drippings to make a country gravy.  Excellent!!!!

Wow! I changed the measurements to tablespoons instead of teaspoons (except for the salt) and marinated the chicken in buttermilk for about an hour.  I dipped the chicken into the flour mixture, then egg mixture, then into bread crumbs. The breading stayed on and the chicken was amazing! My husband is a picky person and loved this. We fought over who was going to get the leftover for lunch the next day! I'm going to bread everything with this!

I tried this recipe-my first time attempting to fry chicken-and EVERYBODY wanted seconds! I did as others had suggested and floured the chicken, then dipped it in egg and then used panko bread crumbs. It was delicious and the coating stayed on very well. Definitely going to make this again!

I had never attempted fried chicken before this recipe. It was delicious and easier than anticipated! I found it to have just the right amount of breading and it was juicy. I'll definitely make this one again.

Loved this recipe!!  I usually just coat in flour and a little garlic powder and this recipe ended up being so crispy and coated well.  Everyone in my extremely picky family enjoyed it!

It's easy, incredibly moist and tender, and my husbad asks for it every week.  I use smoked paprika and just a little more garlic (I didn't there was enough) for a little additional flavor.

I usually make this everyother week if nt every week, my family loves it! I usually fry it then bake it. Remember it's one tablespoon of garlic, not tsp. 
I usually use eat it with pasta and spaghetti sauce, or garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus

We really enjoyed it, but to be called GARLIC Chicken Fried Chicken the garlic needs to be more prominent. Next time I'll add some more garlic powder.

This is sooo good, that my family prefers it to the friend chicken recipe that has been in my family for years.  I haven't tried this recipe with a full frying chicken yet, because my kids don't even care that they're not able to eat a leg (their favorite) and I like the ease of using breasts.

I found the recipe to be a little on the bland side. The "Garlic" in the title is misleading. I have another chicken fried chicken recipe I will continue to use.

I tried this recipe and it was very good.  The only thing I did differently was to add a little honey barbeque sauce on top to add a little zing to it.  Very good recipe.  I will definitely continue to use this!

This is a new favorite in my house. I added some fresh garlic which added quite a bit of flavor that everyone loved! I put the chicken into the egg mix, then rolled it into minced garlic before putting it into the bread crumb mix. It held in that garlic flavor very well. 
My son rates this meal as a 15 out of 10 and my husband says it's his favorite and I need to make it more often.

A DELICIOUS Super-Fantastic recipe. Only changes I made was half and half for the milk, and plain bread crumbs because it was all I had. Only used the breading as needed, and saved the rest. Can be sure I will be using this breading a lot. Can't wait to try it on Chicken fried steak.

My whole family absolutely LOVED this recipe. My younger siblings actually asked me to make it AGAIN the next night. I also soaked mine in buttermilk, but only for about an hour. Then I poured off the buttermilk and mixed it with the egg.

This is the best fried chicken I think I have ever had.  I only gave it three stars because I had to add more garlic as it was cooking and the coating all feel off as I was cooking the chicken.  I used olive oil to fry it in and next time will douple dip the chicken.  Overall great recipe with lots of potential

This was ok for me.  I doubled the spices (but not the flour and bread crumbs)... it was still bland to me.  Also was upset at the amount of flour/crumbs/spice mixture that I had to throw away.  It seems like I wasted a lot - maybe 1/2 the amount of crumbs and 1/4 of the amount of flour would be better next time?

Another wonderful recipe I have found on this site. I made this exactly how it is written and it was excellent. Next time I will be adding more garlic because I love garlic, but my family and I loved this. I served it with steamed broccoli with cheese sauce and a broccoli cheddar rice mix. YUMMY!!!

I used chicken tenderloins, which are perfect for chicken fingers.  I followed the recipe exactly as submitted and my family loves it!  My teenage daughter will actually make it a point to be home for dinner when this dinner is planned!  If you are using chicken breasts instead of chicken tenderloins, I suggest pounding the chicken with a mallet in between two sheets of wax paper or a zip lock back, into thinner (about 1/2") pieces to make frying time shorter.

Marinated chicken strips in Franks Red Hot all day. Used 1 tbs of all the spices. Covered in flour then egg&milk mix then coating. I refrigerated for thirty min as CookinGheri suggested. Cooked on med high about five min per side. When served with ranch it is like a boneless hot wing. Everyone is crazy about them. It is unbelievable how good the breading stays on. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recipe.

An awesome recipe that can be used in a number of other dishes. I went the extra-fat way (next time I'll try the oven) and deep fried them which worked just as well maybe better.

Yum in the tum!  I don't follow ratios too exactly (comes of not owning a set of measuring cups/spoons at the moment) but this recipe doesn't really require careful measurement.

I also add cumin - just because it's my new favorite spice.  Goes really well with the chicken.

Very good!!!  Breading wise this was the best breading recipe I've found.  It actually sticks and it's crispy...both things we love!  We pounded 2 large breasts and cut them each in half to get 4 good size pieces.  The flavor was great, although personally we would probably like a little stronger of a flavor.  It wasn't bland, just not quite as flavorful as we desire.  We dipped it in ranch too, which was good.  Served it with a salad and couscous.  Yum!!!

Some things we talked about trying next time: adding some hot sauce or buffalo sauce to the egg/milk mix and/or adding either some dry mustard or some cayenne to the breading mixture.  Another idea we had was to add some dry ranch (not with the other ideas listed above though).

Breading came out a little thin on only one coat, so I tried two and it came out much better.  Also great recipe for motzarella sticks, with 3 layers of coating.  Not a 5-out-of-5 because my husband didn't care for it.

This was great and easier than regular fried chicken. I followed the recipe pretty close and used the recommended skinless, boneless chicken breasts from the butcher.  My hubby is VERY picky and he gobled it right up.  The drippings also make good gravy!

I used chicken tenderloins and these were fabulous!  Fried them on the stove just as the recipe stated.  They were just right--crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  My husband added a bit more salt to his finished pieces, but I thought it was perfect, perfect, perfect!

This was really good!  My husband loved it.  I liked it too but felt a little guilty eating something fried!  Did fry it in canola oil though so that helped a little.  Loved the garlic flavor!  Will certainly make it again, just maybe not often.

Great recipe - next time I'll use more garlic and more pepper but overall a good starting point to then doctor to individual taste. I had no bread crumbs so I used french's dried onions & it was terrific! I definitely do that when making again.

It's good.  It's just basic fried chicken with some garlic powder in it.  I'll use it again, solely because its a very "basic" recipe that I can doctor up to my liking.

This is an excellent recipe. I forgot the flour (I do stuff like this all the time) but it was just fine without, I used more Seasoned Texas Toast croutons and crumbed them up with the spices. A big hit with my family.

Very good. Followed the recipe as written and the chicken was very moist and tasty. Added sauteed peppers and onions since I made no gravy, worked well together. Will make again and will pass recipe on to my daughter-in-law, my son will love this.

I took the advice of other reviewers and spiced up the breading with Creole Seasoning. I also made a gravy with milk, pepper, corn starch & chicken broth to put over the chicken. Really great!!

This was awesome! Hubby made it last night and it was so tender and juicy. He used flour instead of bread crumbs, and it was wonderful. I can't wait to try it on steak for chicken fried steak!

This tastes great!!!! I've tried many chicken coatings before and failed miserably.. This is the first one thats been edible!! The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup bread crumbs and half cup flour as i like my coatings slightly thicker. But it does taste amazing and its VERY simple!!!

Great recipe, tasty as well. I would NOT recommend boiling chicken first, this ruins any recipe.. very tasteless! Use boneless or take the chicken off the bone, it's that simple :) If you marinate your chicken (all the time), you will have the most flavourful and non-rubbery chicken!  A little coriander also makes this recipe awesome.. or even parsley flakes.  I've done both ways and each way is tasty. Thx for the recipe!

This was pretty good although I do prefer more traditional chicken fried chicken Southern flavors without the garlic. I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs (more than flour), subbed whole wheat flour for the AP, added paprika, and black pepper. Cooked them in as little olive oil/canola as possible then used the pan for my gravy for over it and mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing.

Very flavorful coating.  I took the advise of several reviewers and added additional garlic, as well as a teaspoon each of rosemary, thyme, and basil to the recipe.  I cooked in Olive oil and was very pleased with the results.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good however my daughter wanted some ketchup to go with it.  I think you have to have gravy, or special sauce to dip it in.  Also I used Panko(Japanese bread crumbs which is very light)instead of regular bread crumbs and they came out great!

This was really tasty when crispy fresh. It was ok cold and ok reheated the next day, but much, much better when fresh out of the oil. I fried it in the oil to get a crispy coating, I drained off the oil and then finished it off in a 350degree oven. The flavour was very good, the only thing I added was some cayenne to give it more kick. I served it with corn, mashed potatoes and a simple chicken/herb gravy. My husband and I will definitely make it again. Thankyou for the recipe.

I made this last night and it was a hit!  I had to cook it a little bit longer than it called for since I couldn't wait for the chicken to thaw the entire way, but still turned out very good!  Chicken was tender and very juicy.  Husband simply loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend and I.  He raved about how it was the best chicken he ever had.  I thought it was good and very moist, but lacking in flavor.  Next time I make it, I will probably double the spices.

I thought this recipe was good but needed more salt. It seemed like it was missing something else but I can't put my finger on it. My hubby made chicken strips out of the chicken breasts and it worked just fine. The chicken came out very moist. We'll use this recipe again with more seasoning next time.

Husband especially liked this recipe. He wants to make fried chicken like this from now on. I did as others suggested and used buttermilk instead of milk, fried on top of stove, then finished about 30 min. in oven.

Very moist but found it a bit bland.  I even added extra seasoning salt and still seemed to be missing something.  I will make again and try adding more seasoning salt.

Amazing!!!  Juicy and full of flavor.  Next time I'm going to try marinating the chicken in buttermilk first.  Thanks!

Used this for my chicken parm, not all stuck to it but I think if I would have followed the suggestions that others had made it would have been fine.  Either way, this was a great recipe, my husband liked and I will use this again!

I am not much of a fried chicken fan, but my family enjoyed this.  I had some trouble getting the coating to stick though.

Good solid recipe, I would add more garlic because after its done its not that potent. The cooking time for my legs and wings were about 20 minutes and the oil amount should be doubled to thoroughly cook the chicken a little faster. I'll definitely make this again

I thought this was good, but not great.  I used the tablespoons of garlic instead of teaspoons, but still, it was just okay.  I used thighs and drumsticks instead of breasts.  Overall, it was a good recipe.

Great recipe. As usual, I didn't measure anything, just tossed it in and mixed it up. Pounding the chicken was very theraputic for anyone who's had a bad day. ;) It took a while to fry and it seemed like everything was going wrong with the rest of my meal...I kept thinking, "This BETTER be good!" Fortunately for my sanity, it was VERY good. *WHEN* I make it again, I will add more garlic and some other seasonings as well. 

I made gravy to go with the chicken, and I thought it was the perfect touch. It was an easy roux-based gravy (the recipe wasn't here, but you could probably find it...it was just butter, milk, flour, cream, and some seasonings to taste). The chicken turned out ever so slightly dry (which is why I deducted one star), so the gravy gave it the perfect amount of moisture and the creaminess was a nice contrast to the crunchy chicken.

A big plus - my picky son LOVED it and had three pieces!

Pretty good - I added in some cayenne but still lacked some flavor but it's a good base to experiment with. I wasn't in the mood to dig out the electric skillet so I pan fried skinless, boneless breasts then finished cooking in the oven. Not as good as deep frying but good enough. It was a little dry but that's my fault. My husband liked this; he commented without any solicitation from me! And that says a lot! :)

This was a fabulous dish and easy to make.  My husband asked me to make it two nights in a row because he like it so much.  The first night I had actually forgot to put the flour in so the chicken was a little spicy but great and then I went with a half cup of the flour the next night and it was perfect!!  We will use this recipe often and we are going to try it on pork chops and fish.
Thanks

While the chicken was moist and juicy, we did find the flavor to be lacking.  This recipe defintely need some tweaking.  It really just tasted like it was breaded with bread crumbs.  Probably won't try this again.

Per my hubby, this is the best we've ever tasted.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used unseasoned panko crumbs, and added just a little more of the spices called for.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe. I finally found a chicken recipe that my husband likes, and I have tried out quite a few in the past 3 years. I have had problems with chicken coming out dry and tough, but with this recipe the chicken was very moist and tender. Definately a keeper.

Holy YUM, Batman!  This was awesome!  I used pre-minced garlic from a jar and Kraft grated parm. from the shaker can and it was still FANTASTIC!  My kids are really picky eaters and even they begged for more!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used turkey cutlets.  I followed the recipe, but I also seasoned the turkey cutlets directly (more flavor).  It was pretty good and very easy to make!

Easy and delicious - my kids loved it as well.  The only thing I changed was I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Served it on whole wheat rolls with mayo, lettuce and tomato.

They were good but nothing special. I ommited the salt and added more garlic (as suggested) but stil not enough flavor. They were tender and we had them with Garlic Mashed... VERY easy to prepare and quick.

Very good. Needed plenty of garlic, but was a nice variation on plain fried chicken. I will definitely make again!

My family loved this! My on again-off again vegetarian daughter said it is the best chicken she's had. I added the potato flakes (that another recipe calls for). Very tasty....

I think I had really high expectations for this recipe after reading the other reviews.  It was good, but not as flavorful as I had expected.

This recipe is delicious.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half lenghtwise to make them cook faster but that was the only alteration I made to the recipe.

I made this with 2 T. instead of 2 t. garlic, but it was still pretty bland. =/ I also used garlic and herb flavored bread crumbs. It had enough garlic taste-but not much flavor otherwise. Luckily in my house we like to "mix" foods like chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy, so of course with a mouthful of mashed potatoes at the same time it's harder to tell that it lacks flavor, and it doesn't taste bad. =]
