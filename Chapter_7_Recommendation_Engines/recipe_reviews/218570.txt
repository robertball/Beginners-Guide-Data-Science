Don't get me wrong, this tastes great but that's because it has a ridiculous amount of sugar in it.

This is a great use of leftover buttermilk!  My daughter and I made popsicles (cutting the serving size down to 2, in order to accommodate our 4-popsicle mold - still had a bit left over, which we happily drank), and we both loved this summertime treat.  I might decrease the sugar by 1/4 next time, as I found them to be fairly sweet, and I wanted to taste more of the buttermilk flavor.  I'm sure this would be delicious as ice cream as well!
