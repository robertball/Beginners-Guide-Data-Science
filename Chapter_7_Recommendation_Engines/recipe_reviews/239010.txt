Thank you, Phil!!  This is soooo amazing. Warm and comforting, the butterscotch is perfect. I had never even thought to look for a butterscotch schnapps, much less to know to add it to a hot apple cider. I have a friend who is a huge butterscotch fan so I just made him a batch to enjoy over the holidays. Heâ€™s gonna love this. Thanks so much for sharing :)
