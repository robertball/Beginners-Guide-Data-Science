This is a quick recipe and has been a hit both times I've made it. Rather than just romano, I used the romano-asiago-parmesan shredded mix, and added a little Italian seasoning. 
It's a good idea to really keep an eye on these while they're under the broiler--if you have the cheese mix piled high, it gets brown very quickly.

These were pretty good .  I divided the cheese spread into three batches and used three different mix-in's - black pepper, sundried tomato and olive.  The cheese mixture, while good on its own really lends itself well to adding other flavors.  My only complaint is that they were a little salty.

Tasty! I used a blend of shredded Italian cheeses instead of just Romano, as that's what I had on hand. Next time I would stick the bread in the oven for a few minutes to toast it before putting on the topping and broiling, as the bottoms were a little too soft. Thanks! :)

Good. Easy. Nice for company or just family. I made on crackers and it worked well also. Caution: The cream cheese/romano mixture is gross until cooked, so don't try it raw!

This is a great change from regular garlic bread. I used two head of roasted garlic mixed it with the cream cheese in a food processor, then mixed in by hand the romano cheese and some dry parsley. It went well with the Tomato and Garlic Pasta on this site.

Quick and easy... we're new to Romano cheese, so it was a different, but good, taste. We had it with Skillet Chicken Parmigiana and it complimented the dish nicely.

Very quick and tasty! I scaled this recipe to 4-5 servings. Mixed half low-fat mayo with half pack of softened cream cheese. Didn't cut into pieces but used on french bread slices and served with pasta. No leftovers here!

Delicious! I love cheese; cream, romano, cheddar, blue, whatever, anyway...this combo was totally yummy! Melt in your mouth cheesy but deliciously crispy on the sliced bread. I used a bagette and a tbs of fresh parsley for color and it was really a crowd pleaser!

Good recipe. Could use a bit more garlic and or salt with the cream cheese and the fresh garlic (once cooked) we found it a bit on the sweet side but still very good and easy

Very creamy and cheesy and my whole family loved them! I sprinkled a little of parsley on top after broiling, looks very "white" without. Will make again!

Next time I will try making in a small oven safe dish (like an artichoke dip) to see if it will stay warm longer and people can smear on their toast.

Awesome and easy!!!  I used French bread and cut into 1 inch slices.  I brushed the tops with rosemary infused oil and baked for a few minutes to slightly toast.  I then added the cheese spread (which doesn't taste so great raw...LOL) and returned to the oven for a few more minutes!  The cheese topping will brown quickly if not watched.  The results were AMAZING!  Crunchy, cheesy and flavorful.  I served these at a party and people complained they didn't get to try any  because it went so quickly!  Will do again for sure!!!

Great base and you'll likely have the ingredients on hand. I made these last minute as a Christmas Eve appetizer. You can easily add onions, chives, black olives, etc. I made the basic recipe as written but will try a variety next time.

I wanted something tasty, quick and easy!  These were a big hit!  I added a little more garlic (crushed) because I cannot get enough of it, but that's just me.   I'll definitely be making these again.  Thank you for sharing.
