I did make a little change with the milk. I only had vanilla almond milk in the house. I substituted the milk with half water, half almond milk. Before I popped them in the oven, I brushed the top with melted butter. I can see how an herb or garlic butter would also be good.
Quite possibly the most delicious and fluffy yummy rolls I've ever made. Will definitely make again.

No bells and whistles, a simple white bread roll.
