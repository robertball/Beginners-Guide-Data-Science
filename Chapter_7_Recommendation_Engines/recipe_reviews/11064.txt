I looked through every single sugar cookie recipe on this site and i decided to choose this one. It simply looked and sounded the best. I made these cookies and i was astonished! They are easy and fun to make and they taste unbelievable! The thing was, i didnt put in the sour cream. I thought that was a very unnecessary item. They turned out better than i could have hoped. I have no trouble saying that they are the best cookies i have ever made. My family loves them! Im going to give them out as gifts to all my friends for the holidays! These are truly great cookies!

At first, the refrigerated dough looked like a disaster: it was very crumbly.  But it turned out ok after a rolling it out.  Tasty!

This recipe was terrible! I made a double batch of these and refrigerated both overnight. Both batches were still VERY crumbly the next day! I tried a couple different things to get the batter to stay together, but nothing worked. I ended up wasting both batches and I was extremely bummed!!!

Great recipe!!! I had to change it up a bit, but still loved it. Here's my changes.
1. Only added 1/4 cup of sour cream. 2. I added to the recipe 'sprinkle small amount of sugar on each cookie before baking'. 3. Had to cook for 15 minutes not 12.

I used this recipe for Halloween, and they came out perfect. Those ghosts and pumpkins were the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted!

We all loved this recipe! I made them exactly according to the recipe except I didn't refridgerate the dough. the dough was soft and pliable. I read the reviews and saw that a lot of testers did but I hate doing that. It worked for me. The sour cream was a wonderful addition.

Recipe turned out great - no refrigeration necessary.  They stayed moist even when they browned a little on the edges.

I love this recipe!  they remind me of a softer animal cracker.  the only thing i did different was to add a tablespoon of milk to help the dough come together.  i also cut them at a 1/4 of an inch instead of an 1/8.  and i cooked them at a little lower temp (maybe 25 degrees less) on parchment paper and took them out when the sides were jsut starting to brown.

Good recipe, and the cookies taste great.  Only problem I had was either I rolled the cookies out too thin or my oven was too hot (I am living in Europe and the oven is in Celsius and I can't set the dial to the exact temp, so I have to guess).  The first batch browned super quick and the rest did not need 10-12 min. to cook.  I left them in for more like 5 min.

First off, let me just say that I have made A LOT of sugar cookies in the past couple weeks searching for the best recipe. These win hands down. The dough was easy to work with, and they retain their shape extremely well. I don't think I even had to refrigerate the dough. I found that I liked them better rolled thicker because they retain their softness that way, but that is just a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe, I plan on doing about 6 dozen for a halloween party!

I too looked all through this site and decided on this recipe. I cut the ingredients in half and made a small batch. Fantastic! Great flavor! Quick and easy to make! I frosted them with a whipped buttercream frosting and lightly sprinkled with colored sugar. I will definitely use the full recipe for my sugar cookies!  I plan on making up a few jars for myself, family and friends!

These turned out perfectly.  You can vary the texture from crunch to soft simply by rolling the dough thinner or thicker respectively.  Somesprinkled colored sugar before baking was enought to give them some color and character.  My husband's unit ate them all at their first formation and now wants more.

Best sugar cookie recipe ever!  Everyone who has tried them loves them!  Added a sugar frosting with almond extract (powder sugar + almond extract + water) or lemon extract.

Much better than your average sugar cookies!  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have sour cream so I replaced it with cream cheese.  It gave it a lovely zing.  I found that if you divide the dough in half and flatten it before refrigerating, that you only need to chill it for about an hour.  No problem with crumbling as others have stated. Delicious!!!

WOW! I HATE sugar cookies because they are so bland and card boardish... but this recipe is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!!! I read the reviews and did reduce the sour cream to 1/4 cup and refrigerated over night. When the dough came out of the fridge it was still pliable and easy to work with.  I did not mix it like a cookie in a jar recipe so I didn't mix the sugar with the flour, I just added the sugar after the eggs butter and sour cream. Then added the dry ingredients. And Baked at 375 for only 10 minutes.  They were soft and chewy with TONS of flavor! I already wrote this recipe down in my book! I suggest you do too!

This cookie recipe was awesome. I was having the problem of it being really crumbly and all I did was add 1 1/2 tbsp of water and it fixed my problem. They came out wonderful! They are a great, inexpensive gift also.

the dough is very thick when you're first making it.  The raw dough is delightful. I added alittle extra vanilla which made them better.  I haven't finished refridorating them yet.

This receipe seems to be all over the place. The ingredients are not all listed. Need to add the sour cream  and egg on there somewhere under ingredients. Other wise this is a really great receipe. yummy. I did not freeze or refrigerate the dough either and they came out great.

Meh. These cookies rolled and cut well. Mine were done at 8 minutes. I liked the idea of using sour cream in a cookie, and no shortening, but overall, they weren't amazing. They'd go well with a chocolate frosting to sweeten them up.

I added a couple Tbsp heavy cream to bring the mix together. It rolled out beautifully without refrigerating it. Scraps pulled together great too. I just wasn't happy with the taste which was frustrating because of all the work the kids did cutting out shapes and decorating. It was a fun project though, and the recipe made a huge amount.

I tried this recipe for the firs time this weekend. I lost my mom's recipe and was in a pinch looking for a replacement. These were okay. Overall the taste was fine but the dough was crumbly and hard to work with. It seemed to be more of a shortbread mix than a sugar cookie mix. I had to frost all the cookies just to make the sweet. I would probably not make these cookies again.

At first I didn't realize it was for liter jar & all I had where quart jars. So saddly ;) I had to make them. He He. They where the best sugar cookies ever!!!. I thought the sour cream dumb, but made cookies soft even 3 days later.Oh and I put in 1 tbsp of nutmeg instead of tsp for a richer taste.

This recipe was so delicious. A lot of other sugar cookies recipes just don't come out right. The shape I did (star) made 4 dozen cookies. Most of the time my family doesn't trust me with baking, but they tried them, and fell in love with them. My aunt randomly came over and ended up eating 10 cookies they were so good!

These cookies tasted great! The sour cream is not listed in the ingredients, but is in the instructions. Don't miss the sour cream, it really makes the cookies!!!

You are not supposed to bake it yourself! You put the dry ingredients in a jar and give the jar as a gift!  That is why all if the ingredients are not in one spot... they are directions for the person you give it to!

I haven't tasted these yet, but have decided to only give it 2 stars since the instructions to refrigerate the dough over night leaves you with a hard dough  ball that's impossible to roll out.  I have 3 kids all set to make cookie dough and can't do anything with it until it sits out at room temp for a couple of hours. :(

it was really good at first it tasted like  then i remembered i forgot to put the sugar in it it started to worry me when it started getting crumbly however once everything was mixed and i started mixing it with my hands and rolled it out if was really good the only thing i changed was the nutmeg i added 1/4 tsp. instead and it was really good strong enough to taste but light enough to let the other flavors set in  this is a really good recipe and I will definetly use it again

I really enjoyed these cookies and will certainly make them again. The only thing I changed was to leave the nutmeg out since my family doesn't like it, and to bake the cookies for 9 minutes on 365F which left them softer.

Fantastic, I followed the recipe word for word and they were fantastic. Whoever didn't like this recipe just doesn't know how to cook. Simple as that. We made Halloween shaped cookies and used a buttercream recipe I also found on here

I've used the recipe for the past four years. No need to substitute anything...it's perfect just the way it is. I picked up a great frosting recipe from here too. This is almost exactly like my grandmas recipe.

Doing these for xmas this year. I definitely agree there needs to be a flavor...didn't do the nutmeg and probably would've been better had i put pumpkin spice,lemon or something else to that effect, but they're still good. Made combination of turkey, pumpkin, leaf, reg round and striped cookies...yield was more like 4 dozen! Good sugar cookie!

this recipe is for a cookie mix, not a cookie.  all the ingredients for the eventual cookie aren't in the ingredient list.  if you follow this recipe you'll have a jar of mix with some instructions on it.
