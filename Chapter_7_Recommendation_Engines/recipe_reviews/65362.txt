No wonder I liked this cake - it wasn't until I tasted it and remembered another Crisco pumpkin cake I made not long ago, that I learned the two are the same! Just as my rating for "A Little Country Pumpkin Cake," this is 5-star good - moist, dense and not too sweet.  I was tempted to omit the raisins, but did include them and they  are a worthy addition, but not necessary.  I also used vegetable oil rather than the melted Crisco, saving myself a few minutes. I drizzled the cake with a simple powdered sugar glaze to which I added a couple of good shakes of cinnamon. Very pumpkin-y!

I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and doubled the orange zest in the glaze which made a huge difference. Very moist and flavorful. It was a huge hit for Thanksgiving last year so I'm making it up again this year!

A great way to surprise everyone with a new pumpkin recipe for the holidays!  I substituted applesauce for the oil.  This made it more dense, but still very good.  Also, I used only 1.5 cups of sugar which did not sacrifice the taste.

The first time I made this it was good enough to make again, but with some modifications. I changed the following ingredient amounts to: 1-1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. Crisco oil, 3 eggs, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The original recipe had too much cinnamon and ginger for my taste and my pie recipe has nutmeg so I threw that in. I wanted to reduce the sugar and eggs and I didn't want to have to melt some shortening. I've done it both with and without raisins and it's good either way. It turned out fine with these modifications and I personally like it better.

I'll definitely be making this again.  The only change I made was to replace half of the all purpose flour with cake and pastry flour (but I do that will all my cakes), and it was awesome!  Definitely wait until the cake has cooled off completely to glaze it, though.  Mine was still warm because I was in a rush and it kind of disappeared, but still tasted great.

Very good cake and it fixed my pumpkin craving.  This is a very, very moist cake and I think I probably should have baked it an extra five minutes but it's still good.  I left out the raisins and replaced with pecans.  I used a different glaze on top (melted butter, milk, powdered sugar and cinnamon) and it was delicious.  I also used oil instead of shortening and it was fine.  Great cake for the holidays.

This cake was amazing! It was so moist and delicious, even my husband who doesn't really like pumpkin loved it. I did not do the orange glaze because I didn't have any oranges so I did a pumpkin spice glaze and no walnuts.

I made this cake with the vanilla icing and my family positively devoured it.  This cake is so moist and tastes even better the day after it's been baked.  If you're looking for a recipe for pumpkin cake, look no farther; this is it!

This is a great cake.  I didn't add the raisins, or the walnuts.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, which I think added just a little punch.  The glaze is very good, with just a hint of orange and adds moistness to the cake, although it doesn't really need it.  I served it as part of my Thanksgiving desserts and my family just loved it!

Moist & tasted just like pumpkin pie!
I didn't add the raisins (we aren't raisin fans). I also used butter. I neglected to read the part about melting it; didn't seem to matter!
I didn't use the glazes, so I can't rate them. I used Caramel Frosting VI. Next time I'll try a cream cheese frosting.

I made this for Christmas day dessert. All of my extended family raved about it. I made it the day before and it was so moist. I did not have crisco and used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil instead. Absolutely perfect! (I did not make the glaze, just sifted icing sugar over the top before serving.)

I would make this again in a heartbeat. I made some changes based on what I had on hand but mostly followed the recipe as written. It was amazingly moist and flavorful. I had a scoop of pumpkin ice cream on top. Whoa! Knock my socks off. It's that good.

This is such a moist cake. It's more spice flavored than pumpkin, so I used a caramel glaze from another recipe, and it was the perfect flavor with it.  I'm guessing this cake won't last long - great Fall flavors!

It was very moist, but it was a little denser than I expected.  Maybe it was the silicone bunt pan I used -- not sure.  I may try it again in another pan, but it wasn't my favorite.  The flavor was pretty good.  I added some Pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices to boost the pumpkin flavor.

I bought by mistake pumpkin pie filling instead the can solid-pack pumpkin and I had to use it. The cake turned out perfect!  Very good recipe, very tasty and easy to make. A must for holidays.

Nice flavorful and moist cake. I served it to a group of friends, and even the avowed "pumpkin-haters" gobbled it up! I made the vanilla frosting instead of the orange (but I used real butter---shhh!).

I'd give this 3 1/2 if I could. The cake was nice, but not special. It did look lovely come out of the bundt pan cleanly. I didn't like the raisins either; they seemed to me to interrupt the texture. The glaze didn't give me that zing of orange flavor I'd hoped for; I think I'd try o.j. concentrate next time, or maybe a little extract.

I made this tonight with 1/3 cup coco powder and replaced the crisco with butter. Delicious! Everyone loved it! I debated with what I should put on top, I ended up using powdered sugar. Great recipe with a little tweaking.
