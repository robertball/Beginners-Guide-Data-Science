1.22.17   Scaled this down to 6 servings, and ended up with 6 perfectly-cooked muffins (sorry now I didn’t bake 12) at 20 minutes.  This muffin is the best of savory and sweet, the raisn-caraway seed combo is a winner, it’s tender, and the texture is just firm enough, but not dense.  And OMG, are they quick and easy to make.  joaniecny, thanks for a delicious new muffin recipe!  ****UPDATE 5.23.18:  I make this recipe often and keep these muffins in the freezer.  In an effort to lighten, today I sub'd Egg Beaters® for the egg, Truvia® Bakiing Blend for the sugar, and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter® Organic Spread for the butter.  They baked up beautifully, and are delish!

This  recipe rates a 5 for ease of preparation.  It's sweeter and closer to a muffin texture than Irish Soda Bread.   To avoid over mixing the dough, I had the egg and buttermilk at room temperature and wisked the melted butter into the liquids before adding to flour mixture.  If making 12 muffins you'll have to mound the dough in the muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes.  I made 18 normal sized muffins and they tested done at 15 minutes.  Is also a great base recipe for substitutions by swapping out the caraway seeds and raisins for other dried fruits and nuts.

I have made this recipe, but the recipe doesn't tell you that there's enough  batter for 12 jumbo muffins. I only had one muffin pan so i put the rest in a loaf pan. Everything tasted great. I used paper muffin cups.

This recipe was good. It is not very sweet. I had currants at the moment and used them. It was good. My actual qualm with it is that the batter sticks to the muffin paper cups. If I make this again, I would use baking spray on the tin. Now, my recipe yielded 15 cupcake sized servings. Muffin tins are slightly bigger therefore the original recipe will yield 12.  If you use cupcake tins, you will get 15. I might try using demerara sugar next time and additional melted butter as suggested for a golden top. However, the 30 minute baking time yielded nice golden tops in my cupcakes.

I made the Irish soda muffins for Christmas Eve and my hubby loved them.  I had extra butter, so I brushed the tops.  I did not have paper to line them, so I buttered a muffin pan.  They came out great!   My hubby  asked me to make them for him again!   I am happy!

Finally! This recipe made the "Thanksgiving" cut! They were all gone! I have made Irish soda and a variety of breads and muffins for Thanksgiving for many years. They are a tough crowd when it comes to the breads/rolls/muffins because it's an after thought to the rest of the meal. Not this time! Pass the butter!

Not much flavor.  Put in extra raisins and no seeds.  Topped with Turbinado sugar.  They seemed to stick to the cupcake liners.  Not something I will repeat.

Family went wild over these! We even made them more healthy with half whole wheat flour and a few oats sprinkled in.

We celebrate St. Paddy’s day every year and when looking for a good Soda Bread recipe, I ran across this recipe. I made it but not fond of Caraway seeds, I will omit them next time. 
I will try candied lemon or orange just for fun. The muffins are moist and delicious. More cake like and not dry like Soda Bread can be.

These muffins were easy to make and would be good with a glass of milk or a hot tea in the morning. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, otherwise followed the recipe. Caraway seeds add an adult flavor to these muffins and these are not too sweet. Also, I would cook for 20 minutes only because the muffin tops get hard and crunchy when cooked for 25 minutes--which I enjoy, but my kids, not as much. Glad I made this recipe. This made 16 muffins in regular size tin, with paper liners.

These were so easy to make, didn't even need a mixer.  They are moist, which many soda breads are not. I would watch your bake time carefully, it's a hot oven and I took mine out at 20 minutes. I can see many variations to this basic recipe (without the caraway seeds) Like dried cranberries, nuts and orange zest. Endless possibilities

I did not have enough buttermilk so 3/4 cup is regular milk and I did add orange zest to mine. It is light and tender.

to much sugar and baking powder. they did not taste like Irish soda bread, more like muffins or pancakes. They were ok, just not Irish soda bread.
