Fantastic! I may have added a little too much salt, but this was an outstanding recipe that I will make again and again.

This recipe didn't work for me at all? For some reason the grease all separated out and the drippings clumped together. Very disappointing, smelled wonderful.

Loved this turkey gravy! The white wine just made it, and the dried rosemary was the perfect touch-it became my new go-to gravy recipe. Thanks for sharing!

this gravy was ok... there was way too much rosemary for my taste and it turned out a bit salty. but the consistency was good. i'll try it again with a few adjustments.

Second year using this recipe, incredible flavor. I had tried a wine based gravy years ago and never could replicate it until I found this.

It was a total failure and for only one reason:  TOO MUCH BLACK PEPPER.

This recipe is amazing. I use tapioca starch because my sister has a corn allergy, but it turns out just as amazing. This is a staple at our house for Christmas and thanksgiving dinners!
