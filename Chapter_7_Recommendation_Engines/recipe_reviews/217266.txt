I joined allrecipes.com just so I could rate this incredible recipe. I made it exactly as printed and I will make it again and again! Yam and kale are big favorites in our home, but we haven't put them together until now. Delicious!

Delicious, and made even better, in my opinion, by adding a liberal amount of crumbled goat cheese on top when serving. I did it to add protein so as to make this salad a complete dinner, but found that it added an amazing depth of flavor to the whole combination.

My family did not like this that much, but I loved it enough not to care.  I used packaged, torn kale which is usually tougher and more bitter so I will try again maybe with a different green hoping to make them like this.  I could not get enough-and the kids did pick out the sweet potato and ate it so it wasn't a total flop (yes, I do know there is a difference between yam and sweet potato but I don't think the difference is enough to search out the yams instead of using a sweet potato:-) ).

The garlic put in at the same time as the onion became terribly bitter. Once the vinegar is added to the kale and yams when mixing recipe together at end of preparation, it renders the yams mushy. The taste was OK, but a warning to anyone making this recipe, add the garlic in with the kale instead of caramelizing it with the onion. Another tip would be to add the vinegar to the kale before tossing with the yams.

Same for me, Phynn!  I joined JUST so I could rave about how yummy this salad is.  I used sweet potatoes and fresh kale (cooked so it was just barely wilted). The flavor and texture contrasts make this super healthy salad a fun new addition to my clean eating menu. I'm so psyched to have discovered another clean meal that's full of nutrients and FAR from boring.  Wicked easy to make too...I'll be making this ALL summer!

We have been trying lots of dishes with Kale as we have a bumper crop this year.  This salad was great and a nice side to prep ahead to make the dinner rush a bit less rushed.  Unique and delicious!  My meat-i-vour husband thought that bacon would be needed to make it acceptable, but once he tasted it his comment was "it could almost have used more kale"!

I had no trouble rating this 5 starts simply because it is a close variant on a dish I have been making for years ;-) 
My version has it served hot, tossed with either chucks of sausage (any type you like works from mild Italian to sweet chicken/apple to turkey kielbasa to vegan) sauteed' with the garlic, or chunks of leftover cooked chicken, to make it a satisfying meal ;-)

Great recipe! I had to cook both the potatoes and kale a bit longer. I omitted the thyme and used balsamic vinegar because that is what I had.

I made this last year and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was that I use balsamic vinegar because that is what I had on hand. I wouldn't change a thing. I never saved the recipe and could not remember where I found. Imagine my elation when I ran across it just now. I will be making this again tomorrow. I think a small slice of meatloaf next to this will go well.

I was skeptical about the vinegar at the end, but it totally brightens up the dish! It really is too good to let it cool. It's delicious warm! LOVED this dish!

We happened to have left-over bacon from breakfast that we crumbled and added.  It was great, but would have been just fine without the it.  The only trouble we had was carmelizing the onions without burning the garlic.  Next time, I will add the garlic late in the carmelization process.

Fantastic use of kale. It's not my favorite veg, but we get tons of it every year in our CSA so i am always looking for new (better) ways to use it. I only had 1 yam, so roasted some beets, too. great combo of sweet/salty. i would pay money for this at a restaurant!

This is an amazing recipe.  I also added a handful of chopped walnuts and some goat cheese, which another reviewer had suggested, and it was divine.

just a note on the comment about the garlic burning: put oil in pan and add garlic BEFORE heating oil.  Garlic will not burn then.  I rated this 5 stars bc I just love yams and kale, and all the reviews are so good I'm sure it's a winner!  going to make it now.....  :)

This is a very unique and interesting marriage between three super foods (I count the garlic).  I did a lot of tweaking by using balsamic glaze and vinegar when the glaze didn't pack the punch I wanted.  I also added feta cheese.  Four stars because the recipe doesn't tell  me what a "bunch" of kale is or even how large the yams are and what's a jewel jam?   I winged it with the 5 smallish sweet potatoes I had on hand and they worked fine.

Very good and healthy salad.  The recipe fails to mention that to get kale tender it must be cooked for 10-15 minutes.  I also added 1/4 water to kale to help it steam until tender.  The kale absorbs all the liquid.

Loved it! Just made a few changes. I didn't have red wine vinegar or yams on hand so instead used lemon juice and sweet potato. Also, I was so hungry I couldn't wait till it cooled...so I threw the roasted sweet potato in while the Kale cooked. And then added the lemon juice. Simply divine. Will be making this one again. :)

We've never had kale before, so I searched the best-rated recipe to try it for the first time.  Maybe it's just the kale that makes this recipe a "one-star".

Not quite a five but almost.  I tossed everything together while still hot and liked it very much.  It was even better chilled as the submitter suggested.  The thyme is perfect and the dish is very pretty.  I will make this again enjoying it both ways, hot and cold.

This was wonderful.  I did end up having to put some water into it while the kale was cooking to help it wilt.  I also used sweet potato fries, partly blackened to carmelization, instead of yam cubes.  It was wonderful!

I've been trying to introduce more kale into our diet and this was a hit. I didn't have yams but substituted sweet potatoes.  The first day, because of time constraints, I didn't cool the ingredients so we ate it hot.  I chilled the leftovers and had them with lunch the next day.  I really like the combination of kale and sweet potatoes, both hot and cold.  The vinegar flavor reminded me of a hot wilted endive salad my grandmother used to make...delicious!  Great recipe!

The contrast between the kale, the caramelized onions, and the sweet potatoes (the difference between sweet potatoes and yams is negligible in my mind) is fantastic!  The flavors really compliment each other and make this simple dish really complex.  My roommate wasn't a fan (he's decided he doesn't like kale), but he still picked out the sweet potatoes and ate all of those.  I'll definitely be making this dish again, though for just me next time which means I get it eat it all!

Sweet potatoes and kale...2 of my favorite veggies!  I like Lacinato kale in this, and I prefer sherry vinegar to red wine vinegar, but either way, this is delicious!

Highly recommend this recipe. My changes: didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried and sprinkled on the onions while they were caramelizing, added the garlic at the end of kale cooking (to reduce bitterness), didn't have red wine vinegar so I used a splash of balsamic before removing transferring from pan to serving dish. My kids, 9 & 16, loved it.

Contrast between sweet yams and bitter kale is fantastic. The second time around I used dry mustard and fresh ginger with the salt and pepper when tossing the yams. Love this recipe!

WOW, this was wonderful.  Please don't rate this any less than 5 stars if you changed any of the ingredients, it's just not fair.  I used Lacinato Kale (not the curly kind), which is super easy to hold on to one end and strip the leaves from the stem (kind of like you would rosemary)  One suggestion; is to add the garlic JUST BEFORE you add the JUST WASHED kale, reduce heat to med-low, cover and let cook 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Depending on type of skillet used, this may eliminate the burned garlic and having to add water to your kale.  Mine came out PERFECT cooking it this way.

so yummy even my 14 year old loved it! I roasted the onion with the yam in the oven to save time and tossed the yam in red palm oil, salt and pepper.

I made it just as described (except with sweet potatoes) and loved it- it felt hearty and had good flavour. Didn't peel the sweet potatoes. Will try this recipe again for sure.

Delicious salad. Great way to combine two super foods and the sweetness of the yams really provides nice balance to the kale flavor. Everyone that tried it loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

My picky husband is currently stationed in Korea for a year. So we are using this time as a food adventure. I have to say this was surprisingly delicious! This will now be on our fav menu. I did make a few changes. I microwaved the sweet potatoes for 8 min in a covered glass dish to save on time. I was fairly liberal with butter. I forgot to use the red wine vinegar. Again, for time's sake we ate the whole thing hot. And I added some feta. End product was not as low fat, but it still had lots of nutrition and I am looking forward to eating it again. :)

I liked the combination of yams and kale, but didn't like onion in it, nor did I like the red wine vinegar and fresh thyme - it just didn't seem to go well.  I used only 1 Tbl. vinegar, and it was still slightly overwhelming.  Next time I'll just stick to the basic ingredients, omitting the onion, vinegar, and thyme.

Sooo good! I'm on a really strict diet and have to eat really healthy. I'm always looking for new ways to cook kale and I love yams. The flavors meld together really well. The only thing I changed was no vinegar or onions and I steamed the yams and kale. I sautéed the garlic and thyme separately and just mixed everything together in a large bowl sprinkled with a little pepper and kosher salt. Tastes better the next day!

Interesting salad indeed and one I enjoyed because it is very different. All the ingredients taste well together and I liked it best chilled. Color combination is beautiful. Great way to use kale.

I used butternut squash just because I didn't have yams. I also used a little malt vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar. It was great! Thank you!!

This has become my go to side dish for parties.  I double the recipe and use a bag of baby kale (no chopping required and not as tough as regular kale).  It is best if made the same day as served.

I enjoyed this recipe immensely...only I did not make it as a salad.  I made it as a hot side dish to chicken and it was wonderful: tasty and healthy.  My husband liked it too.  I will definitely make it again as a hot side dish.  Changes made: instead of 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, I just put a light sprinkling of Balsamic Vinegar on top and I added 1/2 teasp. of dried Thyme instead of the fresh thyme as I had none of the latter on hand.  I made this and another vegetable dish simultaneously and it took about an hour. To save time, you could roast the yams and/or stir fry the onion ahead of time.  I also used bagged kale that was already shredded.

I've made this 3 separate times over the past 2 weeks because I'm obsessed with this recipe.  It's so good!  I like it cold, like the recipe calls for, but I also eat it warm.  I make kale chips and add it to the sweet potato while it's still hot and it's a very filling and delicious meal.

Fabulous...used balsamic vinegar bc that's all I had on hand at the time and it was fantastic.  Can't wait to make it with the proper ingredients :).  When your 12 year old asks to take the leftovers in for lunch the next day and repeatedly requests you make the dish again, you know you've found a keeper.

Enjoyed these flavors together. Don't over-roast the yams, I took mine out when they had the slightest bite to them, perfect. My kale was a little wet (had to try to dry it...) but that is my fault for trying a slightly different procedure.  We prefer our dishes fairly highly seasoned, so added extra garlic, vinegar, and doubled the thyme. Served with feta and walnuts as suggested by reviewer, an improvement IMO. I might prefer this warm. Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this recipe! The uniform size of the roasted yams is key to get this to turnout right. My yams took a little longer to cook, but I didn't  have a big enough pan so I ended up mixing up the yams at 20 minutes then cooking them for another 15 minutes. I was also short on kale so I added in some spinach and it still tastes great!

Great salad. Would have liked more flavor on the yams. Start with using coconut oil. Then add some Indian spices.

Wow! My recently-turned-vegetarian boyfriend said this was one of the best things he's ever eaten. I was pretty blown away by its deliciousness as well. I followed the recipe exactly but left out the thyme and also sprinkled feta cheese on top before serving. YUM!

I left out the vinegar and served it as a hot side dish with chicken. I didn't have garlic, but I used ginger garlic paste. I cooked the onions with a combo of olive oil and butter. It was delicious!

This looks delish! I am making this for dinner tonight with a few minor changes...the added goat chesse sounds great, tho i am a vegan but my housemate will add some to his...i will caramelize the red onion I am using in a dash of maple syrup & omit the vinegar...i am using toasted pecans to give it some crunch & making a fresh grated lemon ginger dressing to pour over the salad and i can't wait to try this dish! The yams are roasting in the oven and the kale is from our organic winter garden.

I just made this and my family didn't wait for it to cool. My 7 yr old son loved the kale and my husband asked for a second helping. I added some pre-cooked roast chicken slices to even out a low cam dinner. I can see some people enjoying bacon, but for us that would be too much fat for this light salad.

My family loved it! I read other reviews and used the balsamic vinegar I had on hand, added an additional yam, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. This one is a definite keeper!

What a dose of tasty good-for-you!! The family wasn't so keen on the kale (it was still a little bitter) but I thought it paired very well with the sweet potatoes (what I had).  I would have liked a little more guidance about how much kale, yam, and onion were needed.  I used 1 very large sweet spud I had on hand and half a large sweet onion and the remnants of my kale.  I eyeballed things to try to get proportions equal and the result was still a bit strong for me until I added more sweet potato.  I used the red wine vinegar as stated and that really bound the flavors nicely, but I think the icing on this was the goat cheese, as recommended by another reviewer.  The goat cheese is necessary in this...my bites that don't have goat cheese pale in comparison to the other bits.

I was trying to find a recipe that added potassium to my diet to lower my sodium retention, and this fit the bill.  I didn't expect it to be so good though!  I did add a drizzle of honey right at the end, and that with the vinegar combined did a nice job of canceling out the bitterness of the kale.  A wonderful dish for vegetarians, people with high blood pressure and  even diabetics! (sweet potatoes are low on the glycemic index.)

This is absolutely fantastic.  Brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  Didn't have fresh thyme so used 1 tsp of dried basil--was fine.

Prepared it exactly as written, and ate it warm for dinner.  Loved it.  Ate it cold for lunch the next day sprinkled with some sliced almonds and a bit of crumbled feta and loved it even more!  Cannot wait to make this one again.

OMG, wonderful, wonderful.    It is important to caramelize the onions, I use 3/4 of a large onion and use 4 cloves of garlic.   So Healthy and delicious

This was a great combination. Colorful and tasty. I used red kale which is a little more spicy but only because it's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.

We discovered this recipe last year, and have made it several times.  It still wows me!  The only change I make is to roast the sweet potatoes about 40-45 minutes because we like them a bit crispier.  DELICIOUS - thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I didn't use the thyme and I added a bit of water to help the kale wilt.  In addition, I like my kale on the less crunchy side so I removed from the heat, covered, and let it sit for 10 minutes before I placed it in the fridge.  Lastly, I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic.  I can't wait to make it with the red wine!  Sooo goood and healthy.  I was also surprised that a little bit of salt goes a long way with this dish.  Don't over salt it or you will be mad!!

What a fantastic dish!  I've made this type of side before with the veggies undressed, but the acid from the red wine vinegar brings this up a few levels.

What an amazing combination of flavors! Like many reviewers, I served this warm rather than cold and added crumbled Gorgonzola at the end. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine simply because that is what I had on hand. Wonderful!

Absolutely love it! So far, I prepared it about 10 times, every time adding some news non-vegetarian ingredients, such as cooked chicken, grilled salmon, sweet Italian sausage, smoked pork. I steamed kale instead of adding it to the onion/garlic mixture to preserve color and vitamins. And it came out very good, if red wine vinegar is substituted with white balsamic vinegar.

I love this salad! I have made it exactly as written, it is wonderful.  I have made it substituting roasted sugar pumpkin for the yams and balsamic for the wine vinegar.  It is equally as delicious.  I must agree with others, it is great served warm.  Addition of chevre is a decadent twist! Thanks, Matt D.!

So delicious.  I love yams and I love kale- but together they were fantastic, especially with that "bite" from the red wine vinegar.  I added some turmeric for good measure.  I served this as a side dish but I will make again as a main for lunch as it is so satisfying.  Thank you Matt D.!

Great mix of flavors! I might use more onion next time as I used the super sweet vidalias and they carmelized beautifully! Added the garlic once the onions were mostly done so it wouldn't be bitter. 
Healthy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This was an interesting combination - I don't know what jewel yams are, so I used regular yams, and they were pretty big, so I felt like there was too much yam and not enough kale in my salad. Also, did not taste the vinegar much at all, may try balsamic or add a touch more...I did not wait for this to cool off, it is great as a warm dish as well...A little crunch might be nice - almonds or sunflower seeds??

Love the mixture of kale and yam. Hubby didn't like it much but I did. A different way to fix yams without adding a bunch of sugar to it.

I had butternut squash and kale that I neeeded to use, and found this recipe.  I roast veggies often, and loved the twist of making a cold salad with them.  I liked the kale, but find it to be a bit chewy, so I think I'll try substituting arugula next.  The possibilities are endless!  Thanks for sharing this healthy, easy, vertisile recipe!

This was good! Previously I'd only had kale in a soup, so I thought this looked like a nice and easy recipe to try it in. It was good both hot and cold. This is not something my husband would really go for on its own (maybe as a side dish), but I will make it again (more for me)!

Delicious!  This recipe was wonderful and simple.  I am giving it 4 stars because I rarely give anything 5 stars, unless it blows my mind! Also It says to refrigerate this "salad" and I think it tastes great warm.  Great to take in your lunch the next day.

Just so I could try out the new Cuisinart, I sliced the yams & steamed. The yams got too soft, but it didn't really matter... the combo was still delicious. Couldn't wait for everything to cool, so I ate warm. Yummy.

I've never had kale before, but this was a great way to try them for the first time.  Will make again, thank you!

Very good.  I made this almost exactly as written (I too had to add some chicken stock during the final step of cooking down the kale)    Very tasty and a wonderful use of two superfoods.

I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand (bacon grease for oil, sweet potatoes for yams, balsamic vinaigrette for red wine vinegar) and ate it hot instead of chilled. Good enough to eat as a main dish instead of a side!

This was quite good.  Next time I will leave out the thyme, it's a little too strong for my tastes.  If you add the garlic when you are caramelizing the onions, the garlic will burn.  I waited until the onions were caramelized, then added the garlic.  This is unusual and tasty and combines two foods I like very much.  I will make this again.

Very good. Made as written. I did put the minced garlic in a separate cold pan with oil to cook prior to adding it to the onions that were started in another pan. That makes for a sort of labor intensive dish but, so worth it.

I did not make any changes. Kale was tough, thyme and vinegar didn't add any flavor. We picked out the onions and sweet potatoes (we can't get yams) and threw the rest away.

Simple, healthy, and good for meal prep.  As other reviewers mentioned, fresh kale is better than bagged, and add garlic later with the kale as to not burn it.

It was delicious.  I did not cook the kale long, just slightly so that it was still crisp but tender.

I made so many changes, I give it a 5 for a very interchangeable recipe! I replaced chopped garlic with scapes from the garden and threw in some chopped leftover red pepper . I microwaved a diced sweet potato then tossed it into translucent onions so they could both caramelize. As time was of the essence, I didn’t cool anything but instead tossed the torn kale with the wine at the end for my warm salad version. I threw in some macadamia nuts into the mix and served with a sprinkle of thyme. Thanks for the inspiration and awesome springboard to launch from!

Kale grows really well in my garden so when the crop explodes, I make this dish regularly. I sub 6 slices of pepper bacon for the olive oil, remove it when done, and cook the onions in some of the remaining grease. The bacon gets crumbled in with some goat cheese at the end. Not exactly healthy but so yummy.

this was pretty good. I used the ingredients called for, but I did change the preparation to save time and steps. I roasted the yams, onion and garlic together. while it was roasting I tore kale and tossed with oil and vinegar salt and pepper. I massaged it in a little to help it wilt some. when yams were done I tossed them with kale mixture. the hot yams helped the kale wilt a little more giving it just the right tenderness. that way I didn't have to dirty another pan to cook onion, garlic and kale. it turned out well. my husband ate it and got seconds. so that's a win.

I thought this was delicious. I waited to add the garlic until I added the Kale as some reviewers recommended. I added about 1/3 cup of water to the kale when I put it in the pan,  and I let it cook off. This is my favorite kale recipe.

I was shocked at how good this was,  I wanted to make something so my sweet potatoes wouldnt go bad and I bought Kale as well, so i found this recipe,  made it exact,  didnt wait too long for it to cool and it was excellent,  it made it into the save folder.

This is a phenomenal recipe!
It has become my go-to side dish for any meal.
The sweet and savory flavors complement each other beautifully.
I find myself by-passing the main course and going for this wonderful side dish every time.
Will make this again and again and again....

Great salad! The earthiness of the kale compliments the sweetness of the yams and onions perfectly. We served it warm with a hearty soup and it made a beautiful and very satisfying supper. Definitely will do again...and again!

This was delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the thyme because I don’t care for it.  It was just as good warm as it was when it was cooled.  The addition of the red wine vinegar really brought out all of the flavors in the dish.

This dish was okay when fresh, but beware. If you are a fan of leftovers, this has no next day/ reheat value. Just don't make more than you can eat that night.

This is sooo good! My new favorite lunch! I used a little balsamic vinegar instead of red wine mixed with Dijon and fresh thyme. Also topped with some toasted pumpkin seeds. Yummy!

I followed the recipe and it was okay.  To be fair, I don't like kale.  I eat it because I should and this recipe made it more palatable, but I don't know if I'll make it again.  My salad came out a little dry with the yams (maybe I should have cut them smaller) and the kale...well, even garlic and onions (which I love) can't counter the sensation of chewing softened leather.

Here's a hint I got from another Allrecipe to lessen the bitterness of fresh kale.   Once you've chopped it like you desire,  put the kale in a bowl with a little salt and message it for a few minutes.   It does add a saltiness to it so be careful not to add more salt to the salad till you've tasted it.   This is a great, healthy recipe.  I also added some feta cheese and used the balsamic vinegar.

This was delicious. Adding it to my faves! The only thing I changed was delaying the garlic addition for a little while so it wouldn't get too crispy. Otherwise I follwed the recipe and happy I did.

I make this exact recipe using roasted butternut squash!  It's very versatile!  Any combo of roasted veggies works--beets, carrots, parsnips, rutabaga.  Top with a sprinkle of feta or goat cheese for even more flavor!

It was good.  I used less kale because the sweet potatoes are my favorite.  I thought some slivered almonds might be good as a garnish, but I didn't try.

Good recipe.  Followed the instructions with only a few changes due to what I had in the fridge.  Did not use garlic but made sure my sweet onion was very caramelized along with 1 pound of turkey sausage in the same fry pan.  Make sure you add plenty of fresh kale.  Fresh thyme at the end, salt and pepper and a couple of tablespoons of real maple syrup instead of vinegar created a nice play between salt and sweet.

I loved this although I changed it a bit. I don't like garlic, rather my stomach doesn't like garlic so to make it tastier I added 1 tsp of Balsamic vinegar, toasted pecans and some crumbled  Feta cheese. I also added less of the thyme. It was delicious!

Delish! This is a winner for anyone who likes sweet potatoes and kale. I agree with those who carmelized the onions first, then added the garlic along with the torn kale pieces. I used balsamic vinegar because that's my preference. I followed the recipe to cool and combine, but also reserved out some to eat hot. While it's good both ways, I actually preferred it hot. I tossed in a few sunflower seeds in the cold version, to give it a little crunch.

I  made this according to the recipe and it was excellent!  I did use sweet potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Also served it warm and added garlic to the pan after onions were carmalized so garlic wouldn't burn. I made it a second time and topped with toasted walnuts and goat cheese as another reviewer suggested.  Those additions  made it even better and gave more dimension to the dish.

I really liked this dish- however I did make a few adjustments like using mustard dressing and added the garlic after the onions carmelized. I used this as a main dinner dish also by adding turkey sausage. But the kale and yam combo is fresh and wonderful for the fall. Will make it again for sure!

Saved myself time and  bought precut yams, and already had a bag of kale in Refrig.  Easy to make for family a weekday dinner and exotic enough for guests.

Very good! I halved the recipe and used white wine vinegar, and since I didn't have fresh thyme I added some dried thyme to the kale mix while it was cooking.

I've made this a couple of times now...added salted quinoa, and seeds and nuts mix for salads. 

The red wine vinegar, and onions contrasts well with the sweet potatoes. Sautéing the Kale and removing the veins also very nice.

This was so good I woke up thinking about it the next day.  Can't get over how incredibly tasty it is, and SO healthy!  I will make this again and again.  Made exactly as written, except substituted sweet potatoes for the yams.

Although I did like the flavors in the salad, the toughness of the kale was hard to get past. I cooked it until wilted. I don't plan on making this again.

I loved this recipe. Very healthy. I made it with roasted butternut squash that comes already cut up. It is such a quick salad both hot or cold.

Love this way to make kale.  When I just want the kale without yams, I add a handful of craisins to provide a touch of sweetness and always use balsamic vinegar instead of red. Took the craisins version to a party added a sprinkle of toasted sliced almonds on top, big hit!

I love the texture contrast of kale and sweet potato. Modifications: kept kale raw but massaged with dressing, used white wine + vinegar + dijon mustard + sugar/salt instead of red wine vinegar. Kept the salad simple with those two main ingredients but added wheat berries and dried cranberries. Delish!

I enjoyed this, and will make again.  I followed others advice to add garlic towards the end of cooking the onions, so as not to burn the garlic.  I used balsamic vinegar as that is all I had.  I used sweet potatoes,  which is what makes the dish.  I have cooked kale with onions and garlic before, but it was nothing special.  But adding sweet potatoes to it makes it special.  Also, next time I might even use more sweet potatoes!

This was a great way to incorporate kale into a healthy diet.  I made this as written and my husband and I both really liked it.  The only thing I would change is to omit the thyme.  It's not one of my favorite herbs anyway, but I don't think it added to the dish.  In my opinion, it didn't blend with the other flavors.  But, that might just be a personal preference on my part.

I used spinach instead of Kale. That might be the reason, I didn't enjoy it as much as expected. Will try again with kale.

I just made this for lunch and my husband and I loved it.  We actually ate it as a side dish, slightly warm.  I used a red onion and added a few red pepper flakes. I topped it off with a little goat cheese as recommended by another review. Thanks Matt.

Loved it.  I followed the advice of others and added the garlic at the same time as the kale, and I added balsamic vinegar before adding in the sweet potatoes.  Also, I used dry thyme because I had no fresh.  Served it warm and it was amazing!

This was excellent. I followed the recipe very closely, but instead of putting in the fridge and serving cold, I served it warm with some sliced Italian sausage. Sauteed the garlic and onion as directed, threw the kale in the pot and let it wilt slightly, pulled the potatoes out of the oven, added them to the pot along with the sausage. Finally, added the red wine vinegar and mixed until well distributed. Adding the sausage made this an excellent one dish dinner. Also, quite healthy when using chicken sausage. Great for those New Years resolutions!

we loved how this recipe had fresh ingredients but i think what was lacking was the seasonings/dressing.. we really wanted to like this more.. we ended up putting more red wine vinegar, some lemon juice, and seasoning salt (The Salt Lick Original Dry Rub).. bf thinks we're just into highly seasoned food and this came off like something was missing

I HATE vegetables but am trying to eat better so I tried this without many expectations. OMG it's amazing. I cannot stop eating it.  I made it exactly as written except I ate it warm instead of cold--the thought of cold kale wasn't appetizing.  I removed the kale/onion//garlic  from the heat, stirred in seasoning and vinegar, added the roasted sweet potatoes, and served.  Wow.  This is going in the regular rotation.

Only made one change. Replaced the bunch of kale with a 9 oz. packaged "Sweet Kale Chopped Salad" which also contains broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage and radicchio.

This was an elegant recipe. I used sweet potatoes as that's what I had on hand. Didn't have feta, so used mozarella and Parmesan ... Feta would definitely be better, but even so, it was simply fabulous. It's just amazing that these few simple ingredients add up to such a tasty dish. I usually just read the reviews, but this time, I simply had to contribute as well.

This was great! I had to make a couple of substitutions ( i.e. Fresh spinach , white wine vinegar & dried  thyme were what I had on hand plus I added beets as suggested by another reviewer) but it was terrific. It was also well received by my teen- who is taking the rest to school for lunch tomorrow. I look forward to trying this with other herbs such as cilantro, basil or mint for a change.

Delicious. Just had some leftovers for breakfast. Used one sweet potato chopped smallish (beware as they shrink in oven) and one head of kale. Instead of red wine vinegar used Balsamic Glaze and a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar.  Would make again.

A good way to make a kale salad. The fact that it was slightly cooked and wilted made it more palatable, and it was really good with the yams. I didn't like the cold fried onions though.

I made this as written, but thought it was a lot of trouble and took extra time I don't have to cool everything and serve it cold. Why bother?  I made it again and kept it all warm  to serve.  We liked it much better! I also sprinkle the sweet potatoes with a little cinnamon and roast them in coconut oil.  Yum!

My family and I weren't a big fan of this. We've never had a kale dish so we're not sure if we just don't like kale or just don't like this dish. I thought it was too bitter. Thank you for sharing it though!

Perfect, and made better over a bed of quinoa and topped with goat cheese, as recommended by another reviewer.

Awesome!!  Just perfect, loved the ease of this recipe.  I will most definitely make again.  I did not have fresh kale on hand at the time, did have a thawed bag of chopped kale in the refrigerator.  I did not wilt the kale I simply added to the bowl and mixed in all the other components, worked out fine; I will try the fresh kale the next time.

Great recipe, really easy to cook and really tasty. Even my son loved it. Searched for info on Kale and according to www.mindscantheory.co.uk it's also really good for memory which is just a bonus!

I made this because I have an abundance of kale and sweet potato at my house.  I do a produce share.  I added chopped bacon and goat cheese, it was not the favorite side dish of the evening but I don't think it was bad. It was a meat and potato kind of crowd!

I thought this was a really great dish. I'm always looking for new ways to use kale and other leafy greens. The only thing though I didn't cool it and use any vinegar or thyme. I roasted the yams on baking sheet wich have them some nice browned roasted sides. I cooked the onion and garlic and kale as directed also. But I just gently tossed them together sprinkled with sea salt and served it warm. Delicious! Will be making this again.

I made this the other night with two medium sweet potatoes and a 5 oz. container of pre-washed baby kale.  We ate it room temperature the first night due to time constraints and it was fabulous!  I've since tried the leftovers cold and warm - still fabulous!  This was a big hit at our house and I will definitely be making it again.

I thought this was delicious, although no flavors stuck out particularly.  I did not cool anything in the refrigerator and enjoyed it about room temperature on its own.

This is excellent!  I served it warm, and left out the red wine vinegar.  I have just discovered kale and the sweetness of the yams is a great compliment to the taste.  Makes a really nice side dish.

I made this tonight and it was so good!  Very light and bright, not heavy at all. I have used kale many times in the usual beans and greens dish but with large leaves that need to be cooked for a long time to make them tender, this was such a nice change. The key is to use small, young kale, my bunch was no longer than 8 to 10 inches long which makes it very tender. This was delicious warm! (We couldn't wait for it to chill.)

I used my "leftover" kale from a soup recipe for this salad and made it exactly as suggested.  Out of this world! Even my husband, who I am training to eat kale said it was vey good.  That is like an outstanding rating from him.

Yummy, I liked this a lot more than I thought I would!  I wasn't sure I would like sweet potatoes, or caramelized onions cold but I did and I ate this up with a smile :)  I have some left over that I'm going to try out on my husband tomorrow and see if he likes it.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I like it lukewarm best, but it is great warm or cold as well.  It's a great next day lunch.  I added a few blueberries to it for the antioxidants at lunch the next day, figuring I could easily pick them out if it didn't taste good, but they were a great addition!

This is a great salad! I served my hot but it was just as good cold. I made mine in an electric skillet and added dried cranberries and toasted almonds prior to adding the kale. Everyone loved it! I made for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas.

company of three and we all enjoyed it. I used sweet potatoes instead of yams. Will make again. I think next time will try yams as they have stronger flavor. Also the vinegar should be good quality or omitted.

I just made this recipe pretty much as listed except I forgot to buy fresh thyme so added about 1 teaspoon dried thyme to the onion-garlic while cooking. This is delicious! I ate it still slightly warm and it was great. Looking forward to trying it cold tomorrow! Bon appetit!

Woderful! Good summery salad and nice way to use up extra veggies.  I also sauteed some sliced leek with the onion which added a nice touch.  Sliced some avocado on top for some healthy fat as well as some sunflower seeds. Delicious and very easy!

Super good! I didn't have the fresh thyme or the red wine vinegar, so I omitted the thyme and used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar. (Not as much, about 3 tsp)
