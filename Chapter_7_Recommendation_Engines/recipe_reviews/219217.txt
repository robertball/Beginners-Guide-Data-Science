This was amazing.  Can't wait to make it again!  I think I'll be adding a little vodka next time. :)

YUMMY! Made this for the first time for dinner and it was excellent. I did not have fresh basil or lemon so I had to used dried basil and used 2 teaspoons and used the "real lemon" lemon juice and left the shredded lemon out. Did not have soft cream cheese so had to use block cream cheese instead. It was fine, just soften it prior to cooking. This was so good with the changes I imagine it would be even better made just as written. This is definitely going to be one I keep in the rotation!

Hubbie and I loved this.  Not too bad for the waistline, either, as long as you don't eat a huge portion.  We used fat-free cream cheese.  I also didn't use any of the lemon zest and it was still quite tangy.

Used some grass fed ground beef instead of chicken.  Added some chedder cheese as a topping.  What an easy and very tasty dinner.

First of all, this was delicious! I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used ketchup.  We didn't have any chicken breast, so I substituted imitation crab meat.  I also don't like lemon juice so I used orange juice instead.  It was delightful.

What I like best was the simplicity of the recipe which produced a very delicious meal.  I didn't have any chicken so I used a pound of ground turkey which worked well.  Also with the acidity from the diced tomatoes, I don't think it needed quite so much lemon.  I might start with half the amount and add it in to taste at the end.

My husband really liked this but I wasn't crazy about it.  The lemon and tomato combo didn't work for me.  It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't something I'd ever want to make again.

I made this as is and it was great.  The lemon really adds a freshness to the recipe.

I have turned into one of those people who try a recipe, dont like it, but like the base and work off that.  I made this as written with the lemon and hated the lemon and tomoto combination.  Try #2, made this as written, used several dashes of red pepper flakes, used a couple shakes of dried basil, doubled the amount of pasta, used almost all of the container of the "whipped" cream cheese.  Mixed this all together poured into a dish I sprayed with veg. spray.  Put this in a 350 oven for about 30 min then topped with mozz cheese.  It was a really simple easy satisfying dinner.  Give this another try without the lemon.

Great combination but sauce was just ok... i think i will use tomato soup next time instead of sauce to make it a bit creamier and less bitter.

I grilled the chicken separately and just used this recipe for the sauce. I combined all the ingredients (minus the chicken and pasta) in a saucepan and then added the chicken and pasta in at the end -- it was awesome!! the basil and cream cheese really make the recipe. a lot of flavor and nice smooth, creamy texture. I will definitely make this again.

I liked the zing the lemon juice gave. It was a quick easy meal. The hardest part was cutting the raw chicken (a task I don't relish doing). Still I could have used a little bit more spice .

This was good but it wasn't the best. The lemon was a little to strong for me and my mom. But everyone else in my family really enjoyed it. It was defnitly something that i haven't tried before. I would recomind this recipe for someone who was a big lemon fan just that if your not a big lemon fan cut the the lemon part in half and instead of putting in 2 tablespoons of lemon only put in 1 tablespoon.

I like this pasta salad recipe.  The family decided it was a little too strong on the lemon flavor so I made a few adjustments to the recipe for next time.  1 tbsp less of the lemon juice, more tomato chunks, and they loved a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan on top.

Used leftover chicken and no lemon peel, otherwise followed the directions. Good, quick way to use up leftover chicken. Flavor was good but not anything amazing.
