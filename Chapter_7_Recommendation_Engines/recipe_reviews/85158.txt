Delicious and absurdley easy to prepare! I cooked mine covered in a 350 degree oven for 15 or 20 mins instead of grilling and it came out perfectly. My husband loved it and wants to make sure we have it again!

My all-time favorite salmon recipe!  You will be amazed at how well this pulls together.  This is the recipe that gets your kids to like fish.  My roommate, who hates fish, tried it and loved it. The honey carmelizes on the salmon, making a satiny glaze.  The cilantro in this pairs very well with the lime and surprisingly well with the honey, which offers a very nice sweetness.  This recipe is very fast, it takes about 10 minutes to put together, and is ready in another 10.  Restaurant quality.  We broiled ours for about 6 minutes per side which is what gave it the wonderful glaze.

this was delicious! I used a little sugar instead of  honey and added olive oil and puried it in the blender. I marinated the salmon and scored the skin. I broiled it in the oven, skin side up, after putting more sauce in the scores. It was sweet AND DELICIOUS.

This recipe was not only simple, but interesting in flavor, which is nice for a change!  The marinade is perfect for salmon as the flavors mesh well together and still allow for the taste of the salmon to come through.  It's light and healthy and tasty.  I actually cooked the salmon in the oven at 400 for 18 minutes.  The trick is to let the honey carmelize so that there is a glaze and a just-short-of-crunchy outer coating on the sides.  Very good and will use not only for simple meal, but for guests too!

I used this glaze on chicken and cooked it on the grill. It was fantastic!!!!!! Serve it with mango and avocado on the side. 

I marinated the chicken in a big pyrex dish, then when grilling the chicken, I put the dish with the remaining marinade right on the grill to reduce the marinade to a sauce. I then added some white wine and red pepper flakes to counteract the honey. Pour this mixture over the chicken before serving and it's out of this world. 

What a great summer dish.

Both my husband and I really liked this dish. We tried grilling the salmon on the Foreman but I would not recommend this as cleaning the grill later was sooo difficult! There was plenty of marinade left too. Quite a waste. So next time when I make it again, I'll probably cut the marinade to half.

Cilantro and honey are such a nice pairing.  Next time we will use smaller filets so that there is more surface area to absorb the marinade.  I think scoring the skin of samlon is a good idea, too.  Great recipe and oh-so-easy.

This simple marinade adds a nice subtle flavor to the grilled salmon. I used more garlic and cilantro and less honey than called for in the original recipe. The quality of salmon used will definately make or break this recipe as the marinade/glaze does not hide the natural salmon flavor, it compliments it.

Ok, this is good!  My kids are never happy when they hear that we're having fish (usually salmon) for dinner, which is typically 3 times per month.  Well, they not only went on and on about liking this, but they asked for seconds!  Unfortunately, I did not have more of the main course, so they settled for my promise to make it again very soon.  My youngest -- age 7 -- said he wishes I'd make salmon this way every time (and tried to get me to promise I would).  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This recipe and the Grilled Salmon I are the best I've found (and very simple).  I cooked this at 400 for about 15 minutes, then bumped it up to 450 to try to get some color.  Check it frequently so your honey doesn't burn.  I cut the honey down to 1/4 c. and left everything else the same for 2 small fillets.  There was more than enough to cover the fish and the other flavors were not overpowering.

Quick and easy but marinated several hours to let the flavors seep into the fish. Very good.

Delicious! 2 cups of honey is a bit much though. For the equivalent of 1 salmon steak, I used about 1/2 cup of honey with half the stated amount of the other ingredients (so double what they should have been scaled). It was very flavorful, but I ended up with a ton of leftover honey mixture, which could easily be used for another steak.

This was way to sweet for us. I cut the sauce/marinade in half and was so glad I did not waste two cups of honey on this. The cilantro flavor doesn't come through at all. I cooked in a foil packet in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. Perfectly done, but too sweet.

My husband fished Puget Sound this morning and came home with a lovely fish.  Always looking for new ways to prepare fish, since we eat is frequently, I tried this.  It became a ceviche type meat completely lacking is the wonderful natural salmon flavor.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the directions and felt it was too sweet but my niece loved it and requested it again. The second time, I added some spicy mustard to the salmon (after the s&p) then poured on the honey and loved the result.

I was very excited about this recipe but quite disappointed.  The flavor was bland, the clean up was sticky and the marinade was wasteful.   I feel that I could have "brushed" the salmon with the glaze, still accomplished the same flavor if not stonger flavored, and not thrown away over a cup of honey *(not an inexpensive item).  I will not make this again.  I prefer salmon with more *kick*.

Great low sodium recipe! Good even for those who are not big salmon fans.

P.S. It looks like the nutrition information for this recipe is calculated as if you ate the entire contents of the marinade instead of discarding most of it after marinating.(And if you prepare the recipe as directed, you will discard much of the marinade). The Calorie and carbohydrate content in the actual dish should be much lower.  
Hope that helps encourage you to try this dish!
-Jackie, RD

Cut way back on the honey to 3 tbs. Increase the cilantro and garlic then added rep pepper flakes 1 tbs. Result was a light pleasant touch with fish flavour not overpowered.

I baked the salmon for 20 mins and though it was done, I thought it was too sweet, with too much cilantro (and I LOVE cilantro!). Our guest didn't care for the sweetness, the other two family members said it was just "okay". I probably won't try this one again, but just our personal taste.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe pretty much spot on except I was going to wrap the salmon in tin foil before putting it on the grill just easier for me to mess with it.  I put the marinade in the tin foil with the salmon.  I believe I put too much of the marinade in the foil.  I would recommend not trying this method.  The honey attacked my kitchen and everything else.  But it really locked the flavor in well.  If I use the tin foil again I will probably use less honey.  But the flavor of it was perfect.  Best salmon I've ever had.

We liked this one; the  honey turned into a nice glaze - just needed a little more flavor for our tastes. Next time I may add a little crushed red pepper or green onions.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  I did cut down honey to one cup and still had pleny of marinade.

Really good!  I didn't have enough honey, so I added some dark corn syrup.  I also added some thinly sliced green onion.

This was quick, easy to fix and I had all the ingredients on hand. I do note that with many of the salmon marinades, you can't taste the salmon. With this recipe, you can taste the salmon - and I like the taste of salmon so it worked for me.

The rest of the family thought it was great. I thought it was good. Used less honey than requested and suggest adding a little spicy heat.

I have never really liked salmon because it always had a fishy taste. This recipe has changed my mind. I hesitated on the first few bites, but once I truly savored the taste, I loved it. My husband ate every last bite.  I used the amounts for 2 servings. I prepared it exactly as per the recipe and mariniaded probably 45-60 min. I baked in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. The honey did burn a little and attempted to smoke up my kitchen, but I just took it outside.  The fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky.  The combination of ingredients gives it an interesting taste that is really good.  We'll definitely be cooking this again.

This was an okay recipe.  I will try it again because my husband was a big fan of it (he ate my salmon, his, and the leftovers eventually).  I thought it was bland overall.  Will add more cilantro next time.  Maybe a little salt.  Definitely less honey.

To lighten the recipe, decreased the honey to 1/4 cup.  It was light and flavorful!  This one is a keeper.

My family hates Salmon but I decided to try this recipe to see if I could get them to eat it, and they all loved it!!!  My Salmon haters told me that they would be willing to eat Salmon once a week if I make this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as given and I'm glad I did!!

This was Outstanding. I am not a huge salmon lover but fix it occasionally for hubby. I cut the honey in half, upped the garlic and lime juice a little and used lots of cilantro. I love cilantro so there can never be too much. All these flavors complemented the salmon like I have never tasted before. I also grilled it on the George Foreman. I'm sure it would be that much better on the grill but didn't have the time. It still turned out delish!!  Will definately make again and again.

Well, I didn't have all the honey necessary so I had to substitute some maple syrup and that seemed to work okay. I made the sauce for salmon and tilapia. It tasted MUCH better on the salmon, DO NOT TRY with tilapia.

This was delicious. I found it was a nice sweetness to the fish. Couldn't taste the cilantro too much nor the garlic. Maybe reduce the honey amount. Otherwise good!

This is so simple and delicous.  I did a few things different though.  I cooked the salmon in the oven on a pan lined with foil and at the end of cooking I taste-tested it and all it needed was a good pinch of kosher salt spinkled over the top. I served it with rice pilaf and cooked spinach.  It was very good.

I have made many dishes over the years (over 20 years) and this was the BEST YET!  I actually substituted the salmon with Mahi Mahi and baked it as someone else also did - the juices just make the taste buds celebrate!  I served it with baked garlic red potatoes also found on this site!  This dish is also better the next day due to the juices blending with the fish and potatoes!

Excellent Salmon Recipe!  I used wild-caught fresh salmon and cooked it in the oven; 350 for about 20 minutes.  I also put small shavings of butter all over just before putting into oven.  I paired it with hot jasmine rice and Yellow Tail's Big Bold Red wine.  Next time I will be using more fresh garlic (I enjoy extra garlic).

This was an amazing marinade.  The salmon was absolutely perfect.

The only thing I would change is that you don't need nearly as much honey. I made three large salmon steaks and only had 1 cup of honey on me, which turned out to be more than enough.

My feeling with seafood is simple is best as you want to taste the fish not drown it out, no pun intended.  This recipe perfectly showcases the flavor of salmon and I will repeat it often.

When I read the review saying that this marinade overpowered the taste of the fish I knew this was the recipe I needed.  My salmon was a disappointment when I brought it home and opened the package.  Not fresh enough with a fishy smell.  I would have given it to the cats but did not have time to change the menu.  I followed another review and cut back on the honey. I increased the garlic and added a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes.  I grilled it until the honey gave the outside a nice crust and the center was on the rare side.  It didn't taste like salmon, it tasted like the flavorful marinade and that saved the day.  I agree with the others that I would not use this marinade on a good piece of fish.    I give it 3 stars because the marinade is easy to prepare from ingredients I always have on hand.  Too much honey for my taste and not enough zing to rate higher.

This recipe was awful. I made it for my BF who hates salmon and for me who loves salmon. He still hates salmon and I really didn't care for the honey marinade. It never really glazed and was a bit watery (perhaps too much lime juice?). Either way I didn't care for the flavors with the salmon. Will be removing this one from my recipe box.

Cilantro with Salmon is a great idea but this was WAY too much honey.   I mean two cups of honey???? You lose all the salmon taste.  The recipe is quite good if you just use a quarter of the honey that it calls for.

Very flavorful way to make salmon on the grill. I started to make this before I realized that I didn't have enough honey- had to substitute some maple syrup and sugar - and it still worked out well. Must be the combo of sweet, garlic, lime and fresh cilantro.  Can't wait to make it again- with the proper amount of honey!

I wasn't crazy about this.  The flavors all seemed a little "off" in the marinade, but given the high rating of the recipe I thought it would taste a bit better when cooked.  It was only okay.  Won't make again, unless I alter the recipe a good deal.

Not sure what the whole 5 star fuss is about. I made it exactly except marinated it for about an hour before putting it on the BBQ. The taste was just okay, subtle. Honey is expensive and I didn't get a lot of bang for my buck. It was boring. I'm not going to make it again.

i've been looking for a marinade for salmon for a while that'd make me go 'ooooooooh!' and this was finally it!  i discovered at the last minute that i had less honey in house than i thought, so i ended up using less than called for in the recipe.  plus i took the advice of some other reviewers and increased the garlic.  i left it sit in the fridge for a good hour before baking it in the oven for 18 mins (basting it now and then with the marinade) and grilling it for 2 mins to crisp up the top a bit.  absolutely delicious!  i'll be using this regularly.  definitely a recipe that you'd be proud to serve to guests. :)

Loved loved loved this!  I made this while I was without internet for a month, so I just did it from memory (had viewed the recipe a couple times because my sis loves it, and I've been meaning to make it).  I remembered everything but the garlic!  And while I was eating it, I thought "garlic would be good in this!"  Lol.  I have to admit I didn't use nearly that much honey.  Not even half.  I didn't measure.  And I baked at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, probably.  Great flavor- make it, especially if you love salmon and/or cilantro!

We really liked this, but I would recommend marinating this longer than 10 minutes.  While the salmon was sweet and caramelized from the honey, we really couldn't taste the cilantro.  It was still good though.

This was alright, but it is very plain. It was a simple and average salmon recipe. We've tried it several times and it goes over fine, but it hasn't WOWED anyone. Not a burst of flavor.

It was pretty dry and flavorless.  If I were to do it again, I would marinate it overnight, or at least all day.

Very tasty!  I used 3/4 cup light agave instead of honey and added some red pepper flakes.  Made it while snowed in, so we has to bake the salmon rather than grill, but the marinade  tasted like a bit of summer - perfect escape from a freezing Chicago day.  Served with beans and mango/avocado salsa.

Please don't ruin your salmon w/ this recipe.  I'm an Alaskan who is an avid salmon fisherman, and who prides himself on the mastery of the salmon barbeque.  I grill my fish 3 1/2 minutes a side to preserve moisture, and I use only prime king salmon.  Tonight, I ruined the fish by following the recipe to the letter.  The honey had a pyrotechnic effect on the fish even at my reduced cooking times, producing black on the outside and dried-out fish on the inside.  After digging the remaining fish out of the honey-black, I tasted none of the marinade ingredients.  Back to tried-and-true: marinades with olive oil as the primary ingredient.

Great food, used a pretty large size chunk of cilantro, need to cut back on that next time and use a 1/4 of it, as it chars and the taste was pretty overwhelming.  Loved it tho!

Positively THE best salmon recipe ever.  I did not follow the recipe exactly and I did add jalepenos to the mix for a little bite.  It was 12 degrees outside so I baked it at 425.  I basted it with the honey marinde several times.  Upon arriving for dinner that night, my dinner guest said that salmon was not one of his favorites - this recipe changed his mind and he loved it!  I made a relish of peaches, cilantro, lime, jalepenos and a bit of balsamic vinegar.  Served with roasted asparagus and risotto.  OMG it was so good!

I liked this a lot more than I expected to! I love salmon, but generally like it plain and simple.  But this was very tasty.  I only made two servings, so I used 1/4 cup honey, and it was fine - still had marinade left over.  I grilled my salmon in my grill pan and the honey burned a bit, so next time I'd probably remove some before cooking (might not have been an issue on the grill, as liquid can drip away).  I could taste the cilantro, lime and honey, but none were overpowering at all.  Thanks for sharing!

Ended up marinating this over night. It tasted fine, no complaints, but also not overwhelmed. Good way to use up cilantro, but not sure I would want to use up so much honey in a marinade though.

I didnt like it all that much. It might just be b/c I dont really like salmon to begin with. I thought I'd try it b/c I read a review that mentioned her kids not liking salmon and loved it after she prepared it this way. I guess I'm just not a fish person. Oh well... Thanks for sharing anyways!

love the taste. Hubby brought back 50 lbs of salmon from his Alaska fly fishing. I need to find all kinds of recipes for salmon and so far this is one of the best. for those who don't like salmon because of its abit fishier taste than other fish, this can be a good recipe to try. I follow the recipe to the end and didn't change a thing (unusual for me). easy to make and be ready in no time.

This was a great recipe! I let it marinade for a few hours rather than just the few minutes the recipe called for.  I also grilled it wrapped in foil to keep the taste in and it worked out great.  I threw in a few scallops into one of the foil packets and they tasted great as well!

This was a nice combination. It turned out better then I thought. When I tasted the sauce before baking it I thought it was bitter so was skeptical but after it was done it was nice. Sweet with a hint of cilantro. I basted it with the sauce that was in the pan. I only made 2 portions so halved the recipe and still had lots of sauce in the pan. I made it in the oven at 400 for 20 min. I probably should of let it go 5 min less cause my boyfriend said it was slightly overdone. He had a cold and from what he could taste liked it and asked for me to make it again when he was better so he could be a better judge.

This was really good. I was worried that it would be too sweet so I used just a little less honey than called for and it was the perfect balance. I let the salmon marinate in the fridge for about 2-3 hours. I do think there is an excessive amount of marinade, so I would halve that next time. Thank you! :)

Very easy and very good.  I prepared the marinade exactly as directed, and cooked salmon in the broiler for about 5 minutes on each side.  The carmelizing effect of the honey in the broiler was really delicious. A great way to use the extra cilantro I always have on hand after making guacamole.

Wow...add some lime juice and your friends will be BEGGING for more.

Did marinade for ~12h then on the grill they went (~14 min/side).

Thanks for the info!

My family loved this. My husband is not a big "fish" eater but loved this and said he could eat this once a week. My 6 year old twims both went back for seconds. I added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the sauce for an little extra zip.

I find this to be so simple, and AMAZING!  I only say to let the salmon sit in the honey mixture for a while longer.  Pair it with a grilled artichoke, and wow everyone at dinner.

It was pretty good.  I did think that the flavor of the marinade was fairly mild considering the ingredients used.  It was fine but not my favorite.

I thought this had a nice flavor, unfortunately I overcooked the salmon so it was a little dry.  My boyfriend thought it was too sweet and had a teriaki flavor.  He asked me not to make it again.

Wait! Two CUPS of honey? You have got to be kidding me!  For four pieces of salmon? That's the same as putting napalm on your grill. Was that a typo? You shouldn't use more than about 1-2 TABLESPOONS of honey for 4 pcs of salmon on a grill. How about this:
Juice of one lime
2 cloves garlic, minced (I use garlic powder  instead, because I'm lazy)
1/4 cup cilantro,  chopped
1 T (Yes, that's right - 1 tablespoon) honey
Warm the combined ingredients in the microwave on LOW for about 15 seconds. Spoon over the salmon after its been on the grill  for about 10 minutes. Use this concoction to finish the salmon, not as a marinade. This is WAY better than the recipe.

I have always known that people who do not know how to cook salmon, always throw soy sauce in the recipe. This was a delicious dish with few ingredients, all of which can be modified to taste. I adjusted the recipe for less salmon, but I always try recipes "as is" before making any adjustments. This one is a winner, as is, and I will only adjust for who I make if for or depending on the mood. More or less honey, more or less garlic, etc.

I broiled the salmon and used Agave instead of honey to make it healthier.  It actually blackened a little and that made it even better! Served with brown rice and peas. Will definitely make it again! Thank you for the recipe, since I am REALLY picky about salmon!

Deliciously surprising! I did cut the honey to half...and for a 1 lb piece of salmon I used 1/2 the recipe (w/ 1/2 c. honey). Grilled it on gas grill for 5- 7 minutes and didn't turn it over. It was fabulous. The skin on the bottom stayed on the grill which was nice.

I reduced the recommended cilantro by half because I was worried about it overpowering everything else and I barely tasted it, so I think next time I'll stick with the recipe. I also used agave nectar instead of honey and I thought it turned out rather well.

i added a 1/4 cup of coconut milk to the sauce, makes it creamier and cuts back the lime flavour - very nice.

I made this exactly as instructed however I baked it for 17 minutes at 350. While the fish was flaky and delicious, I was not a fan of the honey in the sauce.  Should have simply made it the exact same way, minus the honey. It made for a cinnamon-like taste.

This is one of my favorite ways to make salmon! With these changes...I season the salmon with red crush pepper flake, salt, garlic powder, a little oregano, some mrs. dash, a little bit of cayenne pepper, then i marinate the salmon with the honey, garlic, cilantro sauce for at least an hour. And i dont have an outside grill so I baked it with foil on for about 25 minutes and then took the foil off for another 5 to 10 minutes. It was so great. Also right before I put it in the oven I slice one small hot green pepper and slice scallions to go on top. Yummy! 

**You need to season the fish to your taste (i.e. I love spicy so I put lots of different spices)

Excellent! I reduced the marinade to use as sauce and you don't need to do that at all! It's good as is! I also didn't have a lime, so I used some lemon juice and it was still great. Can't wait to try again.

Excellent!  Was worried it might be too sweet, but not at all.  I used some powdered garlic rather than cloves (as I was out), and it was still great. We eat a lot of salmon, and it's fantastic to have another new way to prepare it.

The first bite is surprisingly sweet yet it's interesting enough to keep eating.  Somehow the flavors really work well together!  I ate it with a broccoli/cauliflower macaroni and cheese but it can go well with almost any side that isn't too savory or powerful. I only had molasses not honey and I reduced the amount to 1 cup instead of the 2 like someone recommended (I would've reduced if I used honey anyway.)

There is way too much honey in this recipe without enough saltiness to counter.  I did season the fish with salt, but apparently not enough to counter the sweetness of the honey.  Soy sauce would have been a good counterbalance.  I couldn't taste the other ingredients much.  Also, this recipe could benefit from more marination time.  A warning to those using a broiler: put it on the low setting.  I put mine on high and everything nearly burnt in 6 minutes; I had to finish the fish off in a pan.

I am sorry but this was not good at all. I copied recipe exactly and the cilantro was just way too much, too overpowering. Maybe I am just not a HUGE cilantro fan, though I have always cooked with it I have never really used this much. My family shoved it around their plates. Sorry again for the low review, I wanted to like it I really did. Sorry.

I did not like this at all.  I love cilantro, so the combination of cilantro, honey, and lime sounded delicious.  Plus all of the rave reviews persuaded me to try this recipe.  The honey overpowered everything else including the taste of the cilantro.  Good thing I only had enough honey to add 1 cup instead of 2 like the recipe called for.  Even with one cup of honey this was way too sweet.  It was like eating fishy tasting candy.  Could not taste the garlic at all.  It needed something to balance the overwhelming sweetness of the honey.  Nevertheless I gave it 2 stars because my husband said it wasn't too bad and ate seconds.  No one else liked it.

My husband is an avid fisherman, so we often have seafood, and we thought this recipe was fantastic.  It's now one of our favorite recipes to use with the salmon he catches. I didn't quite have enough honey (almost 1/2 a cup short), so I skimped just a bit.  I still thought it turned out just fine.  We used king/chinook salmon and it was tasty.

I made just one serving and baked it in the oven at 450 for 15 minutes.  It seemed like an excessive amount of honey to me so I only used about 2 tablespoons instead of the 1/3 cup per serving.  I used half a lime and a whole clove of garlic, but overall I could still really taste the honey.  I am not sure how to correct for that as the additional liquid from the extra lime made the sauce fairly runny so it spread all over the pan and cooked into a black mess.  I think in the future I will marinate it and then let the excess sauce drip off before I put it in a baking dish.  Aside from the too-strong honey flavour the lime, garlic, and cilantro went well together.

This recipe was great with a few changes- made it for mom and my boyfriend, who both, let's face it, can be brutally honest.  They both loved it, though!  I did make some changes, per other contributors: used ~ 3/4 of a 'honey bear', upped the garlic to ~3 cloves (I used the minced jar stuff in a pinch, but would go with fresh next time), and then marinated for about 20 minutes.  I brushed a little marinade on (be sure to line pans with tin foil; the honey mix can really stay on there), and broiled for ~6 mins per side.  Yum!

My husband and I have been wanting to eat more salmon, because it is a "super" food nutritionally.  Unfortunately we didn't actually desire to eat it more than once a month.  After eating this salmon we feel like we could eat it once a week.  We did it just as directed and it was SUPER good!

Easy recipe but the taste was slightly bland in my opinion.

I generally cook my fish with garlic and butter, so this was a welcome change. I thought it might be too weird to eat, what with the eclectic ingredients, but it turned out great. We've made it twice now- once on the grill and once inside on the griddle- and will make it in the future. If you're tired of the same old seafood recipe, this is a nice break.

This was really tasty! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less honey and more garlic which gave the salmon a perfect taste, not too sweet (that's why the 4 stars instead of 5), but other than that it was really tasty and will definitely use again.

This has become my favorite way to do Salmon on the grill. Works great in the oven, too. Thanks!

I was kind of nervous making this... thought it would come out way too sweet. It was actually just right, although the honey  really overpowered the other flavors, even though I only used about a 1/2 cup. In the future, would add white wine and maybe some red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness. Also, I used this marinade (in a separate bowl) for a pork chop for my boyfriend who doesn't eat fish... he liked it. Finally, I must have used a small salmon filet, because 5 min per side was too much. 3 would have been better.

I think this recipe calls for too much honey.  In my opinion, it could easily be halved, or perhaps half of the marinade set aside for brushing on just before serving.  My husband who isn't a big fan of fish asked that I make it again although my girls who love fish kept saying it was "gross chicken."  I enjoyed it and will definitely add it to the summer recipe list.

I didn't measure anything for this recipe.  But, following (loosely) the suggestions, I put in more cilantro, more garlic.  Used just under half of a 12 oz honey bear.  Didn't have enough lime juice, so also added lemon juice.  A generous splash of white wine, and a few pinches of red pepper flakes.  Baked at 400 for 18 minutes.  I thought this was, albeit still pretty sweet, VERY tasty!!  But, the kids - who normally LOVE LOVE LOVE salmon - didn't like it at all.

We are still searching for the perfect Salmon recipe, but this one is pretty good.  I love cilantro, but the honey was a little overpowering.  I think with some tweaking, this could be a keeper.

another great recipe for salmon. I used the planks to cook it on the grill. I did soak the planks for about 5 hours so that they would not catch on fire. Our friends loved it

We liked this enough to make again! The honey flavor was just a tad too subtle for my taste, though.

The combination of contrasting flavors is delicious.
