This is delicious!  My picky two-year-old even ate it.  To make it slightly more healthful I did add a couple handfuls of frozen peas (thawed) when I added the other veggies.  Next time I might make it with a little less bacon and add some asparagus, but this is really one of those recipes to which you can add whatever your family likes or just stick to the recipe the way it is and it will still taste great.

This is delicious fried rice!!  It tasted so authentic to my surprise, I would have never guessed using bacon grease would make it that way.  I added a few things.  First I had a frozen bag of peas and carrots mixture, so I added that to the minute rice I cooked and let the vegetables just steam in the pan with the rice.  I flatted my chicken out as much as I could and then sliced it.  After my chicken was browed up I added chopped onions to saute with it. Next time I personally would leave out the actual bacon, but my husband liked it so I'll just break it up finer.  Overall, very good, such a cheap, fast easy meal.  But if you want it to look/taste more authentic, I suggest adding the peas/carrots and the onions!!

Yum, this is so good! Not one little bit left at the end of dinner. I used a little more rice than the recipe called for without a problem. A very good chicken and rice dish without dairy products or canned soups.

I used an extra strip of bacon than what was stated. Also only used one stalk of celery, and added a cup of peas.

It was very good. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you :)

This delicious recipe is quick and easy to make, and I loved it. You can be versatile with the vegetables, and it will still taste great. For instance, I used a bag of mixed frozen vegetables (corn, peas, carrots and green beans) and one chopped onion.

I didn't use bacon when I made this recipe though it sounds like a great idea. When I sauteed the vegetables I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and added a few drops of sesame seed oil.

Similarly when I cooked the chicken, I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and added some sesame oil. I also sprinkled the chicken with dried ginger and cayenne pepper.

Good Recipe - I really enjoyed!  I did add some chopped green onions and water chestnuts at the very end - just long enough to heat.  For a little extra kick -  add about 3/4 tsp of ground cayenne. This one is a keeper!  Thank you!

this is a good dish with changes. first of 3 peaces of bacon did not give enough drippings for the egg, chicken and veggies. the changes i made were after the chicken and the veggies soaked up all the bacon drippings i added a little bit of chicken broth to make the chicken more juicy and mild olive oil to golden/brown up the veggies and the chicken also gives it more flavor, I also seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper to bring out the flavor.
after the chicken mixture was done and set aside I added a teaspoon of butter to cook the egg.
OH MY GOSH IT CAME OUT BETTER THEN RESTAURANT STYLE. i also used 4 peaces of bacon rather then 3 and added grilled onions. It was just amazing even the next day with these changes I will make this dish all the time. Thanks Susan.
If you do not like bland food and love a pop of flavor in every bite then you must make these changes

Very easy, very good, approved of by all 4 children. WOW! (Substituted canned chicken & scrambled eggs with bacon, carrots and celery to cut prep time even more.)

This was really tasty!  I used leftover supermarket roasted chicken and long grain rice.  I added diced snap peas.  Next time I'll throw in some water chestnuts.  I had a bag of crumbled bacon (Costco!) so it was a really quick and easy dinner.

My boyfriend and I love this. We make it almost once a week. We do however, add peas and extra bacon because it's a little bland if there isn't a bacon piece in each spoonful.

This recipe was good. Hardly any leftovers! I did use some garlic while I was cooking the chicken along with some salt and fish sauce. I added chopped onions instead of celery, because we didn't have any. Would make again! Have 4 kids and each had at least 2 - 3 servings extra!

I did double the recipe, maybe that's where I went wrong.  As others said, I did use cold rice, however no flavor at all.  Sorry...

This is so easy and taste authentic.  I don't use the bacon and it still has a lot of flavor.  You can use any veggies you wish.  It has gone into regular rotation at our house.

This recipe was very good.  I have made fried rice before, but I think the bacon in this recipe added what I think my previous ones had been missing.  I ended up omitting the chicken, so I added some extra veggies (onions, broccoli) and revved up the flavor with some oriental 5-spice (cinnamon, anise, ginger, cloves, nutmeg).  Also note that I didn't bother measuring anything, but I think this kind of recipe is very forgiving.  Next time, I think I may add a bit of cabbage.  My husband and I agreed that the rice was far better than the fried rice at our local Chinese restaurant.  In fact, the only complaint my husband had was that I didn't make a double batch.

Always on a quest for good Oriental food since moving to Michiana from Chicago where you can take your pick of some of the best of the best.  Delivery? Forget that here!  Had some leftover rice.   Purchased two chickens for dog food and human food that I was going to cut up myself plus bacon and green onions  from a local farm market.  Never would have thought to saute the chicken and carrots in bacon grease! It worked!  Added some chopped green onion and steamed peas that I had in the freezer from last year's crop.   Also left out the celery and substituted mung beans I'd sprouted.  Delicious! Thank You, Susan Johnson, for posting this recipe.

Delicious!!!!  I usually skip the chicken and make this as a side dish. I like to add diced onion and sometimes a handful of frozen peas.  Always a big hit at my house!

This was so good, I left out the celery but threw in a hand full of steamed peas. I also added some chopped cilantro right before serving. We will definitely have this again.

I loved this! The perfect way to use up that leftover white rice in the fridge! I used mixed vegetables instead of the carrot and celery, and it worked!

I added the peas and the onions and followed the receipe instructions but i did find this receipe bland. we added pepper and sweet chili thai sauce and it stilled needed something some more flavour/bite/zing!

I think it is missing ginger and perhaps mushroom etc . but htis is a good simple base to start with

I never knew why I loved Chicken Fried Rice so much, It's the Bacon Fat!  While not the healthiest it is certainly was delicious.  This will definately be a go to for left over rice.  I had  rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and added it to the bacon fat at the end.  Worked out great, I added more low sodium soy sauce then called for.  A big thumbs up from me, simple and good!

This was a very good starting point for fried rice, however I did a few things differently too like the others did.  I used bacon fat to cook it in since I didn't have fresh bacon on hand, added frozen(defrosted)peas, fresh sliced mushrooms, ginger, 1 1/2 tsp crushed garlic doubled the eggs and the soy sauce(low sodium) and salt and pepper to taste.  It was very good although not sure it was like the restaurants for some reason.

Tried this and liked it, my fiance LOVED it but I thought it was a little bland.  Made according to recipe then added a little more chicken and soy sauce and he put chalula seasoning on his and we both liked it.

Yummy! As good, if not better, than I've had at Chinese restaurants. Leftovers were perfect and not dry because I warmed the rice up with a little bit of water and a lid on top of the microwave-safe bowl.

I just made this tonight for my boyfriend and I, and we loved it! I only used 1 slice of bacon so I added a little bit of oil before I scrambled the egg. In the name of sneaking in more veggies, I also added green onion, mushrooms, and chopped fresh snow peas plus plenty of cayenne pepper. It was delicious! Better even than the our favorite Chinese buffet, and there's even enough left for me to take to lunch tomorrow!

This was delicious!  Had a hard time with the bacon but it was a hit with everyone.   I love peas and onion so I added peas and sliced green onions at the end.  This will be a new family favorite. Quick and easy especially if you prepare the rice ahead of time.

Soo easy and yummy!  I used a rotisserie chicken, omitted the celery cause I just don't like it and used frozen peas and carrots then doubled the recipe but other than that everything was the same.  My sweetie loved it!!  Sooo good.  Oh!  I added more soy sauce also.

This is a great basic recipe!  I would never have thought to use bacon, but it definately adds flavor.  I also sauteed some diced red onion and broccoli in the bacon grease before adding the other ingredients, along with 2 tbsps of butter I added for more flavor. I had left-over rotisserie chicken, so I used that instead of raw chicken and just added it after the rice and veggies. A great way to use up left-overs.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the bacon fat for cooking the veggies, but left out the actual bacon. Instead of carrots & celery I used bagged coleslaw mix.  I thought the flavor was really good and I liked how easy it was to make.

This is a good base recipe and you can add whatever leftovers you like. I used the leftover chicken and bacon from last night's chicken caesar salad and I also added some frozen peas, corn, red capsicum and onion. It's a complete meal in itself with carbs, protein and vegies.

This was pretty good. I think I was expecting a little more because of the earlier reviews. I didn't have bacon so I used some leftover ham and instead of carrots I used peas. It was tasty and I will most likely make it again but it wasn't quite as good as I was expecting It was alright. A great meal to make when you are short on time and have leftoevers to use up!

I made this tonight and everyone gave it a thumbs up.  I left out the celery (a few here don't care for cooked celery) and peas are a definite must-add for us.  Perfect all in one casual fill-em-up dinner.
