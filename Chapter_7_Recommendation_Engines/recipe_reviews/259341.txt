Use parchment paper, it won't stick like it does to tin foil. Also you can use 4 cups of cashews. Really good.

Loved them!! I followed the recipe and WOW! They were a big hit with my entire family. Spicy and sweet. Letting them sit in the egg whites really make a difference. I had to let mine cool down on my foil lined baking sheet since they were stuck together a bit (as expected). Once cool, I couldn't get enough of them, and the cumin hit the spot!

Delicious recipe. I found them a little sweet, so might cut a bit of the sugar next time, but the cayenne  provided just the right heat. Really good, and super easy.  I accidentally left my oven at 250 until the last 15 minutes, but to no ill effect. Thanks.

Addictive! I don't care for sweet flavors but here, the sweet and spicy balance perfectly. Thank you for the recipe.
