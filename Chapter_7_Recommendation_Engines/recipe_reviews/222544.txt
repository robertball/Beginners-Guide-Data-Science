Used St. Germaine instead of maraschino liqueur.  So much better.  Was too sweet with the liqueur. I give it 5 stars with St. Germaine.

I didn't have maraschino liquor, so I improvised and subbed maraschino cherry juice and a little vodka.  This was nice and tart w/the grapefruit juice.  I'm a big fan of bubbles, so I topped it off w/a little Diet 7up.  CHEERS, Allrecipes!
