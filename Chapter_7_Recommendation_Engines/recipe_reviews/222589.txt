I tripled this recipe. I used reduced fat mayonnaise, dijon mustard and white WINE vinegar in this recipe. My whole family loved these, especially my husband. He said they reminded him of his mother's devilled eggs. He said these would be the ultimate for him if they had a touch of hot sauce. These were inhaled. NOTE: For easy piping, I used a ziploc bag that I spooned the filling into, then cut a corner out of the side of the bag. I just squeezed the egg filling carefully into the egg.

I never saw anyone get quite so excited over a deviled egg as I did Hubs when I beckoned him to try these.  And I've yet to see such  an enthusiastic display...over a deviled egg.  He, with the discriminating (i.e., fussy) deviled egg palate said, "Now these are deviled eggs the way deviled eggs are supposed to be.  Deviled eggs are supposed to taste like deviled eggs, not some abomination.  A little mayo, a little mustard, a little celery for crunch; these are SO 'D' good!"  What more needs to be said?  I'm happy to be this recipe's first reviewer, the first but not the last, I'm sure, to say this is a great deviled egg recipe Suzanne.  Hubs thanks you for sharing it.

A much easier version of devjled eggs is to eliminate the chopping altogether and add the mayo, mustard if you like and a couple of heaping Tbs of sweet pickle relish. If you like chopped onion, add it to the yolk mixture. Sprinkle paprika on top of  finished eggs. For a variation, I use hot paprika.

Oh, I am in LOVE w/ these eggs...They are PERFECT! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing. Great balance of flavors and loved the addition of the celery and onion for a bit of texture. I will be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My grandmother is in the hospital and so I was unable to reach her for my lost copy of her recipe for Easter Dinner. This seemed similar, so I gave it a shot. I doubled the recipe, as my family are fans of deviled eggs and it's a big part of dinner. As written, the recipe is rather bland and has too much salt. I remembered my grandmother's recipe uses mayo, yellow mustard, white vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire, salt, pepper and the juice from sweet pickle relish. The changes I made are (for 12 eggs): 1/2 c mayo, 1.5 tsp Worcestershire; 1 tsp vinegar; 1/2 tsp sugar; 2 tsp juice from sweet pickle relish; 1 tsp yellow mustard; 1/2 tsp salt; 1/4 tsp pepper; 1/2 small onion finely minced; 1 stalk celery, finely minced. Blended all together, added a dash of hot sauce (GREAT addition) and filled the whites. I topped with our standard sweet paprika dusting and on a whim a sprinkling of dried dill. *As stated, using the recipe as written was too salty for our tastes, so the adjustments I made take that into account

The mixture of sugar and salt is unpleasant. Also, I don't think it needs the vinegar. Too much going on here...these are not at all "simple"!

This was my first time ever making deviled eggs. I took Sarah Jo's advice and switched to white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard.  Instead of mayo, though, I used Miracle Whip. My boyfriend's dad, who absolutely loves deviled eggs, had one bite, looked at me, and said "this is the best I ever had". I'd say it was a raving success ^_^

I couldn't resist adding my own touch... Added 2 Tbsp. Sweet relish, instead of white vinegar used red wine vinegar, instead of prepared mustard used honey mustard with bacon dressing, sprinkled smoked paprika over eggs. All other ingredients were the same.. Wow! These were wonderful! Hubby and dinner guest went crazy over them.  Will definitely make these again!

These are pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of deviled eggs, but I liked these and my daughter did too (she was the one I was making them for). Although I found them to be quite salty at first (and I love salt),they mellowed out in the fridge over time, but not really enough for me. If I make them again I may possibly increase the mustard a little bit, and decrease the salt.

These are the absolute best deviled eggs EVER. I am not usually a fan of deviled eggs but these are out of this world. I didn't change a thing, made 48 for Thanksgiving for 22 people and they got gobbled up. This is definately my recipe now for deviled eggs. Wish I had some eggs now, I'd make some more. YUM!!!!

These were good. A little too much vinegar for my liking, but next time I'll just cut back a tad.

I made the recipe as is. It was a bit salty for us, but the flavor overall was delish. I will be making these again but decreasing salt by half or even less.

I would have given these three to four stars but I bow to the taste buds of my family and guests who inhaled them.  I cut back a bit on the salt and wish I had cut back a bit more.   I used dijon mustard but other than that followed the recipe.  At first I thought that I did not like the flavor of onion in this recipe but, when I polished off the one egg left behind the day after Easter, I decided that the small amount of onion added a huge hit of flavor.

Great Simple recipe!  I eliminated the chopped onion and celery, (only because my family doesn't like "chopped" onions or celery) and used a punch of onion powder and celery salt in the yolk mixture.  I made the mixture in a ziplock bag and cut the corner for easy piping as well.  If you are looking for  deviled egg recipe that tastes like deviled eggs, this is it!  Thank You!

My family loves these! Right on with the perfect flavor!  The only change I made was, I added 2 Tbs of sweet relish and did not add the celery at all. I also used my frosting bag with a tip to make them so pretty! I think I'm going to make these for my familys superbowl party this week! Thank you for such a great recipe!

this called for waaay to much salt i thought. although i only had apple cider vinegar, so maybe that was part of the problem. i added more egg yolk and mayo and next new recipe i will taste before i add salt

This is our favorite deviled egg recipe, as it is not too sweet and just tastes wonderful.  I subbed white wine vinegar (all I had) and of course used Hellman's Mayo...forgot to add paprika, but no one noticed.  They were gone in the blink of an eye.  Easy, no-fail recipe that everyone loves!  UPDATE: It really matters what size eggs you use for this recipe, and I use Large.  I have come to the conclusion the best outcome utilizes  1/4 cup Hellmans, 2 tsp prepared yellow mustard, 1 TBSP minced onion, 1TBSP minced celery, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp (heaping) sugar & I omit the vinegar.  It works best this way & is not too salty.  I've learned the trick to perfect hard boiled eggs: Boil the water separately with a TBSP baking soda & 1 tsp white vinegar per egg and 1 tsp salt.  When the water comes to a boil, gently ladle the boiling mix into a pan with the eggs in a single layer on the bottom.  Ladle the hot mixture until it is just covering the eggs.  Bring the egg/hot water mix back to a boil, boil them for 6 minutes, then remove them from heat, cover with a lid & let the eggs stand for 20 minutes.  This will result in eggs that don't crack, peel easily & are hard-boiled without the green ring around the yolk.

I didn't add the sugar and celery, added a tad of garlic salt, onion salt, red and white pepper, up the mustard to two teaspoons, and it was  a winner.

At first I was inclined to leave out the sugar but left it in and WOW THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE!  Vinegar and mustard balance the sugar nicely.  The only thing I didn't have available was celery but I know these will taste even better next time when I include celery.  Thanks!

It's easy to make, and tasted good except for the salt. Way too much! I'd cut it in half, or just salt it at the table. It was my first effort at deviled eggs and I'm a little disappointed.

Just made these for our Thanksgiving. They definitely have some zing! Glad I only used half the recommended vinegar, will probably omit next time.

Exactly what I expect with Deviled eggs. Excellent flavor, and easy to dress up with other additions if you like.

I made these for my family and they loved them! I would definitely decrease the salt next time but other than that they were perfect. Next time I will have to double or triple the recipe. Also to make it easy I baked my eggs in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 in a muffin tin then put them in a bowl of ice water for 10 minutes. Super easy to peel!

Made exactly as the recipe was written.  Excellent.  What a nice step up from the old standard I used to make.  Can't wait until I serve these this afternoon to my husband as a nice little surprise.  Love the addition of the onion and celery.

Easter = deviled eggs for me. I enjoyed these and with some different garnishes on top they can be stepped up from simple. Bacon bits were my favorite garnish. I also used olives and pickeled jalapenos on top.

Great recipe. I will make again. For halloween I added red to the yolks to make an orange color. Filled the egg whites with mixture. To look like pumpkins and added a piece of chive for a stem. Came out cute

These are great and I'm not even a big fan of deviled eggs. I added just a few drops of worstechire sauce for a little extra something, I used Cayenne pepper instead of Paprika because I didn't have any, and left out celery because I didn't have any. Even my picky boyfriend said they were great! Will definitely make again!

These were a hit at our house!  I was hesitant adding the sugar and it tasted a little salty the night before I served them, but the next day they were perfect.  I used dijon mustard and sprinkled a little smoked paprika on top... a tip for the smoked paprika, wait to add until right before serving so you don't lose that smoky taste.  Wonderful and thank you!

Made as written. These are not great as is, sorry. We had to add extra mayo to get the mustard & salt taste palatable. We won't be making them again.

Made this recipe today - multiplied by 12. I was making eggs for a church function so used 6 dozen eggs. I did this as one large batch in my 14-cup food processor bowl. I put the celery and onion in first and processed to a fine mince(so that it will later pipe from a bag without clogging). Then added the yolks (about 8 cups worth) and the remaining ingredients. I used Dijon mustard, halved the salt and added a few squirts of vinegar as it was processing to get the desired creamy texture. It came out delicious. I also split it into three bowls and added pesto to one and horseradish to another for variety. I highly doubt I'll be bringing home any leftovers!

I am not a huge deviled egg fan but these were exceptional. I doubled the recipe and I didn't have any white vinegar so I used apple cigar vinegar instead. Apple cider vinegar is a little more mild so I found I did need to add a teaspoon extra to taste and also a little more mustard and mayo....I like my deviled eggs tangy. I also used some black pepper.

I've never made Deviled Eggs with onion before, and I certainly won't be making them without ever again. I used the recipe for 'Divine Hard-Boiled Eggs' recipe to make the eggs the day before.

I made this without the onion and celery to appeal to a wider crowd. I was a little nervous because I had never made deviled eggs before but I assure you, this is a winner.  Just like I remembered eating them as a kid.  I couldn't make enough! Delish!

It's just one of those tastes that makes your eyes squint...recipe is perfect the way it is. I used a smoked paprika which I felt made my left eye almost close all the way.

Good overall. 
Main issue: 1/2 tsp. Is too much salt. I measured that. I thought it was too much. Then tasted. Blech.  Yup.  Lesson learned ... can always add more later.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used dijon mustard, white wine vinegar and miracle whip. I had 36 full eggs to do, though for a large get together and I found that the amount of salt it asked for that amount was a little much. I will reduce the salt next time... Not sure if it was a 6x issue or is an issue in general. It was still good, though!

I have used a lot of recipes off of this site over the past several years.  However, this is the first time that I have bothered to rate any of them.  This is an awesome recipe.  These are easily the best deviled eggs I have ever eaten and my wife and daughter share my sentiments.  I think it is the vinegar, onion and celery that are the keys.  But, the finished product is fabulous.

Really good but too much salt!  I doubled the recipe and used only 1/4 tsp of salt for the whole thing.  I used white wine vinegar and double the celery and onion very finely minced.  The celery adds such a nice crunch and flavor.  My family went nuts for these!  Definitely a keeper.

This turned out GREAT! I love the crunch that the celery and onions add. I put chopped chives on top. I wish I'd made more than 6 eggs...

I'm surprised to find myself giving 5 stars to a fairly standard deviled egg recipe, but there is something about the balance of sweet and acid in this that is just right. I consider the amount of salt to be personal taste, and for us a pinch is enough in this. I have also added a few drops of sriracha to this recipe, and love it even more. I used Chef John's method for hard-cooked eggs, letting my extra-large eggs set for 11 minutes after bringing to the full boil.

I wasn't a fan of the crunchiness.  It tasted too much like I was eating shell pieces.  The filling was good but I thought it needed to be a bit spicier.

I used dijon mustard and white wine vinegar instead, and decided to skip the celery and onion to keep a smoother texture (I did add some onion powder to make up for the lack of onion).  Very tasty!

Good. Simple. But they definitely have a STRONG flavor. Not spicy or bad, just strong. I"ll probably just use sweet pickle relish next time.

Not my favorite deviled eggs recipe.  This was just okay because the flavor was a little....strange.  I don't think sugar with the mayo and vinegar is a good mix.  They tasted better the next day but I would experiment with the yolks a little more.

I made this and it was a hit except for the level of salt.  I would half the 1/2 tsp to 1/4.  

I used the cold water method, starting with eggs in cold water, heating to boiling then setting pan aside to sit for 24 min, then rinsing in cold water.  Eggs didn’t crack and  were done perfectly.  I dipped the knife in olive oil before cutting the eggs in half.

No but I will next time.  Unfortunately the amt of salt is to much and I had to really tweek the recipe once I tasted it .  No biggy other then that it was so simple and really a good combination of things.  Up till now I’ve always had someone else make these and really never paid attention to what went into making them.  Kicker is I’m 61

Made this for Christmas Eve appetizers with my farm fresh eggs.  They were gone shortly!  Everyone raved about them.  Excellent recipe. Made it as prescribed with exception of onions and mayo.  Did not put the full Tablespoon of onion.  Needed a bit more mayo.  Super easy to make.  Will make again.

I followed this recipe to a T... made 60 of them for Thanksgiving. Very disappointing & the absolute worst deviled eggs I've ever made.

I just whipped these up in no time, and they were just what we were looking for! I know a lot of folks eyeball measurements like these, but I'm such a baker that I measured each ingredient exactly and felt that the amounts specified resulted in the perfect blend of sweet, salty, and tangy flavors.

Reduce the salt. Even 1/4 teaspoon is too much.  A couple of twists with the salt grinder would  work. Other than that, they tasted great.

I added 1/4 cup mayonnaise and instead of 1 tsp chopped onion and 1 tsp chopped celery, I used 2 tsp chopped onion.  Turned out great for an Easter appetizer!

Very good base recipe. I find the celery and onion to be too much so I omit those and add dry mustard (~1tsp) and paprika to the mix (instead of on top). Bacon bits would probably be very good. Too much salt. I use half the amount listed.

I omitted the celery and onion and it still tasted very good. The vinegar definitely gives it that tang on the tastebuds. Next time I'll add the celery and onion

Very nice for a quick snack (which I just had).  Good when you want something simple or don't have a lot on hand.  I love creating Deviled Eggs different ways.  For holidays or special events I add variety.  I enjoyed the tang of the vinegar, next time I will try it with White Wine Vinegar.  I also liked the sugar, I prefer it over relish.  I never add relish to mine, it is in too many salads, I feel.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I am not a vinegar fan, so I substituted some sour cream and added smoked paprika for the smoky flavor without the fat of bacon, although I am a great fan of bacon.

It turned out well, though I had never tried to peel an egg before so carefully. I'm like a bull in a china shop when it comes to finely mincing vegetables. And I don't have a pastry bag to spread the egg mixture. I tried using a sandwich bag and cutting off an end. It was... A learning experience. Good news: People loved them even if they were not beautiful! Note to self: Always make 2 dozen for a party (a dozen eggs). Dijon mustard was a hit.

This is my go-to deviled egg recipe! As someone else recommended, I use white wine vinegar. If I find the mixture is too sweet, I simply just adjust the mayo, mustard, and vinegar.  I also omit the salt because I top some with Old Bay seasoning. Others I top with smoked paprika. These are always a hit!

I added more mayo and a little more mustard.  The yolk batter was dry with the amounts in the receipe.  The eggs were a hit!

Good recipe  I like the addition of finely chopped onion.  Definitely will use less salt next time though!

Delish!! I used Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar though. If I had to change anything else, a little less salt would be the fix. Husband enjoyed the slight crisp of the onion and celery. I will absolutely make these again!

I didn’t add the sugar but everyone enjoyed them. In the past I’ve added either fresh horseradish about a tablespoon ,or used horsy sandwich spread for a bit of a kick. With or without they are delicious.

These are my favorite, however, I leave out the sugar because we are diabetic.  I love the classics.  This is a great recipe especially if you are  pressed for time.

Salty and too sour for me (it might have been that I was using eggs which were more "medium" sized, jumbo sized eggs would probably be perfect for this recipe). I can see the appeal of mustard or vinegar but using both to me was too much.

I made the recipe exactly as it was published, and it was delicious.  I used a cookie press to put the filling into the eggs, and they were so pretty.  Unfortunately, some got a little flattened in transport, but at the end of the night, the plate was empty!! I will definitely make these again.

I regret not reading the reviews close enough. This recipe is too SALTY. I usually make these to taste but was making for a party and wanted a bonafide recipe instead of winging it. The author should change the salt on this recipe. I have to make more eggs to try and cut the saltiness of the yolks.

It is okay if you like onion and celery in your deviled eggs, but that takes it out of the "simple" category for me. My complaint is the same as others have mentioned, although it is reasonably firm at first, it becomes much too soft/runny after being stored in the fridge for only a few hours. It is worth playing with if these are the flavors you like. I would suggest only half as much vinegar for starters. Maybe mustard powder and cayenne instead of liquid mustard.

Very good deviled eggs! I didn't have celery so I made it with everything else and waited until the egg filling was in the white egg half shell to add the paprika.

Although I measured carefully, followed the recipe exactly, (except for using seven eggs instead of six), the filling was too wet and runny.  Also, the vinegar, instead of complementing the egg flavor, dominated everything.

7.1.17  This tastes just like the classic deviled eggs my Mom made when we were kids.  If you happen to have a mini blender/food processor (like came with my Cuisinart hand immersion blender), go ahead and put the eggs yolks in there, pulse until they’re finely chopped, add your other ingredients, and pulse again until it’s all blended.  This will give you the smoothest (non-lumpy) egg filling you’ve ever had, and it’s quick and easy.

This is a great recipe. The measurements are correct and they make a great side dish or salad for everyday or special occasions. I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise because we enjoy the slightly sweeter flavor but mayo works of course.

Outstanding.  The chopped celery and onions give the eggs a bit of crunch which everyone loved.  I substituted two packets of Stevia for sugar and they had the perfect hint of sweetness.

These were really good!  I made the following changes:  I didn't put in celery (didn't have) and I used 1 tsp. onion powder.  I also only used 1 packet of artificial sweetener instead of sugar. The only complaint I have with these is probably my fault.  I made them the day before to save time, but didn't cover them with any plastic wrap or anything.  They were dry the next day. They were still good, just a little disappointed with the texture of them.

My daughter and I made this recipe exactly as instructed but they came out way too salty for us! The salt and vinegar combination is really overpowering. We tried adding extra egg yolks, sugar, and relish to balance things out but it was still too strong for us. A truly simple recipe that our family loves is just your basic mayo, mustard, salt, and pepper.

These eggs truly are delicious. At first, I was worried about the lack of sweet relish, but the sugar, onions, and celery make this a hit! I halved the salt, and they came out perfect. I'll make this one again.

Deviled eggs are one of those touchy recipes. Everyone has their favorite. This is a good basic recipe. Way too much salt though. And I'm a salt-a-holic! You can start with this and tweek it the way you want it. I like a bit of Miracle Whip, Catalina dressing and white pepper.

These are very good and easy to make,although I found the vinegar flavor to be overpowering.  I did use white wine vinegar - I don't know if regular white vinegar would have made a difference.  I think I would try this again using pickle juice instead.  But overall, a good solid recipe!

Great basic recipe! I substituted dill relish for the celery and onion, and I added the sugar and salt to my tastes. I also added a couple dashes of hot sauce because we like things a little spicy in our house. :) All changes were personal preferences. I don't suggest leaving the sugar out as it really balances the vinegar and mustard, but I do recommend adding a bit at a time to suit your palate.

The 1/2 tsp salt was too much. So glad I had another 6 eggs ready to go to add to the filling and could salvage it.

Perfect recipe for deviled eggs. Take the time and follow the recipe. Don't cut corners, or change things the first time you make a recipe, you'll never know what your missing if you do.  I find most people that do usually turn out mediocre food at best.

I doubled the mayo and at least doubled the celery and onion (maybe more). I had chopped extra anyway, so I kept adding  to taste and it could definitely use more; just make sure they are very finely chopped or you're going to get a mouthful of onion taste. It was still lacking a little something, so I also added a small dazzle of Siracha sauce... Bam! That was exactly what it needed!

Excellent recipe, super easy to make.  I didn't have any onion or celery on hand, so I left those out. I added a little dill  pickle juice (1 tsp.) for flavor. 
Excellent recipe, will make again!

Very good! I was not so sure about the sugar, but I was wrong. These are great. Made as is.

I prefer a recipe with less mayo.  It does not have sweet pickle, which I like. Also, the mustard at this quantity is overpowering.

I found them the slightest bland, but they were gone in no time at the family Christmas dinner.  I'm making them again for NYE and this time added some extra onion (green onion) and siracha--love it.

Very  good.  I added a bit of relish and blended in the food processor so it was really smooth.  We have banty chickens.  Made very cute tiny deviled eggs.

This was my first time making deviled eggs, and it was super easy. I took these to a work party, and they were a crowd pleaser! I really enjoyed these.

These eggs were delicious.  I did add an additional table spoon of pickle juice.  Everyone at Thanksgiving enjoyed these and my eight year old daughter was asking for the left overs.  Will make again.

Really good recipe. I added a few dashes of siracha to give just a little heat.

This is my first time in years making deviled eggs, my son had to take a side dish for a potluck at school.  So glad it's really simple and versatile.  I went with other reviewers and substituted white wine vinegar and used coarse ground dijon mustard, also added a tsp of horseradish.   The texture of the celery, onion, and ground mustard made it a little fancy.   When my husband makes these eggs he adds finely chopped shrimp and crab, in this case it would have been a little too fancy for kids.  Thanks for sharing !!

I really like this recipe except that the 1/2 tsp salt was too much.

I used celery salt and onion powder instead.  Turned out pretty well.

Wow, these were very salty and I used 8 eggs instead of 6 but left the salt at half a teaspoon as written!  If I were to make them again, I would add salt to my own taste.

These are pretty good. I used pickle instead of celery though because i was out of celery and i ended up liking the end result a lot. The pickle i used as a substitute for the celery gave the deviled eggs a light pickle taste and a decent crunch from the cut up pickle. This is a great recipe. 4/5 would recommend.

I am an inconsistent cook..some days I don't mind a nice, long recipe if it means the end result will be delicious. But on the weekends, dishing up something that's fast to cook and great to eat is a blessing because you get more time with the family.

Thanks for the recipe. It was really really easy and tasted great!

We had a deviled egg taste test between this recipe, 'Popeye Deviled Eggs' and 'Sriracha Deviled Eggs' all from AR.  This was a huge hit as we liked the hint of sweetness that the sugar added and the little bit of crunch from the onion and celery.  I used a green onion of the white onion and the green portion to add a splash of color to the eggs.  Great recipe, would use it again.
