This makes a lot!! Luckily we found it could freeze and refrigerate well, and it was definitely delicious. The garlic powder set it apart from normal creamed corn...although I did add a dash of paprika for even more spice. This is a side dish that goes well with anything, and you'd never get tired of it. Thanks for the submission!

This recipe was pretty good but once I started eating it I realized I'd forgotten to add the sugar! Tasted good without it though I used less cream cheese than was called for. Will make again.

Well my brother and husband just loved this. My kids didn't. They are 8 and 10. It did take a bit longer to cook than expected so I would say to DRAIN VERY WELL - which I did not do.
I enjoyed it. It was a quick change to plain corn.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I actually used more corn than called for and it was still too gooey.  The garlic was very pronounced.  I have had similar recipes in the past that were very good, but if I try it again, I will cut out the butter and leave out the garlic.  Maybe then it will be better.

I have been using this recipe for some time, but just know thought to come back and review.  I have altered to use fat free cream cheese, which does change the texture, but my husband loves it! We eat it atleast every two weeks...........

My guests LOVED this! Followed recipe exactly, threw it in the slow cooker on low so I could give attention to my other dishes and everyone said they liked it! Used fresh corn - all the difference in the world!

This has become a holiday staple for my family.  I usually add extra garlic...and sprinkle breadcrumbs and butter on the top before baking.  (You know a recipe is good when it doesn't even make it into the oven before several spoonfuls are missing!)

This tastes great and I'll make it again, but using half the butter. It was just a bit too rich. But the garlic gives it a nice touch, and the leftovers were great mixed into rice the next day. By the way, I used canned corn and it worked well.

I have made this recipe several times and my husband and I love it. The kids never touch it though, and they normally love corn. It is VERY rich. I use canned corn and it always turns out great.

This recipe was really tasty!  Under the advice of another reviewer, I halved the butter and cream cheese.  It still was a tad too creamy and rich, so maybe next time I'll cut it down to a third or so.  Great start though.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think this had a good overall flavor but found there to be entirely too much cream cheese.  If I were to make this again I would reduce the cream cheese or thin out with some cream or something.

I didn't change anything about this recipe. It came out pretty darn good. The first time I made it I had great reviews. I only had a bit and I liked it a lot. The second time I did it, I doubled the batch. For some reason it wasn't as good. It was still tasty though. I will make this again.

I can't believe I've had this in my recipe box for two years and only just now tried it!  It's a wonderful way to prepare corn.  I tried to cut some of the calories by using light cream cheese and using less than the recipe called for.  I also cut the butter in half.  I added a pinch of thyme along with the garlic to the corn, and used the parsley to sprinkle on top, along with some paprika.
I left out the sugar entirely as I find corn quite sweet anyway.  Turned out great!!

I made a low-fat version and it was delicious!  I reduced the butter to 1 teaspoon, used extra-lite cream cheese and canned corn.  I put the butter and garlic in a baking dish in the oven until bubbling, then mixed in the other ingredients & sprinkled a little fat-reduced cheese on top.

I love this corn!  Every time I make it, I am asked for the recipe -- even men will ask me for it.  Big hit and so easy to make.  Great for pot-lucks and it re-heats well.

I loved this corn! I used 1/2 pkg frozen corn and 2 (15oz) cans of drained corn. I also added an extra tsp of sugar. Baked wonderfully! My family wasn't too keen on it (3 stars) but I grew up with dishes similar to this and loved every bite! I will make again for myself!! Thanks Sharon!

Unfortunately I did not really care for this recipe.  Everyone at Thanksgiving said "it was o.k."  I did use the full block of cream cheese and maybe should have used 1/2 as other reviewers suggested, although I did add an extra 16 oz bag of corn, which I had thought would cut it down.  I think I would make this again but cut the cream cheese by a 1/3 and add some shredded cheddar cheese instead.  Thanks anyway...it was worth a try and was something different for a change!

I have to strongly disagree with the name for this recipe. It was awful. I followed the directions to a T and not one person in my family could be pursuaded to try more than two bites. The texture was terrible, as was the taste. In my opinion, these ingredients do not blend at all!

Wouldn't think these flavors would work well together - boy was I wrong.  Mouthwatering and cravings follow once in a while.  This is my third Thanksgiving in a row that I've made this and I have now converted my family into Yum-Yum Corn addicts!!!

Been using this recipe for years - thanks so much for sharing it! I get weird looks and laughs when I say it's "Yum-Yum Corn" but it's always a hit and has become a "Must Have" holiday side dish. I have not had one "eh, its okay." Always, "Yum! Can I have the recipe"

Couldn’t see any reason to cook the corn, since it was going to bake for 30 mins.  I just  let the corn thaw, mixed everything together, and into the oven.  I used a bag of Birds Eye® baby gold and white corn and fresh parsley instead of dry.  It was a bit of an indulgence for a side dish, but there were no complaints, and there were no leftovers!

This is one of my daughter's favorites. I cut back a little on the cream cheese and I never bake it.  Just cook the corn, drain, add the other ingredients, stir and serve. Delicious!

This was so good and so effortless. The only thing I changed was using 1 tbsp. of garlic powder instead of the garlic clove. It did need more than 30 minutes in my oven. Made it for a cookout and everyone loved it!

This was very good, a new addition and has since been requested quite often, didnt change much except to use garlic powder and fat free cream cheese. Thank you for this recipe, it's easy and everything is usually on hand even if u have to sub canned corn.

My family is addicted to this dish!  It is soooo yummy!  Love it as is, but I usually cut the butter in half, add in a handful or two of shredded cheddar and leave out the parsley. Sometimes if I'm in a pinch, I just heat it in the microwave until everything is melted.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow... I was expecting a "Cream" Corn thing. This blew all of our expectations outta the water.  Only changes I made were using Neufchatel, garlic POWDER, and omitted the sugar.  Awesome!  Will make over & over again.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggests but without the sugar. It's so moreish! I made it as part of a huge meal and it was the first thing to run out. It is quite rich with all the butter but the flavour works and I'd say it's more a case of serving it with something relatively dry like a roast chicken breast so they can balance each other out. Well worth it, I'll be using this one a lot!

I rated this four stars because I did not prepare exactly as written. I cut the butter and cream cheese in half as other reviewers suggested. I'm glad I did because it is still extremely rich. I couldn't imagine it with twice as much cream cheese/butter. As I made it, it was excellent! My husband, however, absolutely hated it, and he is not a picky eater. He said it was too sweet, so if you don't like the sweetness you may want to consider omitting the sugar also.

I made this recipe using 4 ears of left over fresh sweet corn.  I cut the rest of the ingredients in half.  I liked it alot, but I think I should have left out the salt.  1 out of 3 kids liked it, but they are pretty "basic" eaters. The butter does sort of rise to the top, but I didn't mind that. Also, I used reduced fat c-cheese and that seemed to work fine.

I followed this recipe exactly, and was personally not impressed---tasted like corn laying in a block of cream cheese to me, BUT all of my relatives loved it and raved over it, so i guess i am just an oddball.

Amazing, this has become a favorite in our family and a dish people request that I make and bring to functions.  I make it exactly as is.  Tried it with canned corn and it comes out with a little different flavor though. Stick with frozen.

Yum Yum Corn is a good name for this recipe because that is what my family said after their first taste.  We were snowed in for about a week and eating what I had in my pantry. I needed to find a new way to serve corn. I had every thing on hand except parsley and frozen corn. I left the parsley out, and used 2 cans of drained whole kernel corn..  Delicious results! Yum!

I don't add any sugar, as the peaches and cream corn we buy is sweet enough. We sprinkle crushed Ritz crackers on top to give it some texture. Love it!

I added red pepper flakes, drained diced tomatoes, celery powder, substituted garlic salt, and added sautéed onions and red pepper, and a little curry powder.  It is a great way to use leftover corn.  Very good.

I have been meaning to rate this recipe for a while. I made this last Thanksgiving and my entire family loved it! Even my young cousins who are picky eaters! I will be making this again this year. I did add an extra garlic clove because I felt like the recipe didn't call for enough. It was excelent!

This has become a "stand-by" for pitch ins.  Everyone loves it!  My 4 yr old asks for "cream corn please"! Always keep ingredients on hand for those last minute dinners.

This was really good.  Really rich though, but tasty.  I used a little less butter and part Neufchatel cheese.  I also used a mix of yellow and super sweet white corn.  Good Thanksgiving side dish!

A 5 star PLUS recipe!!  My mother-in-law made this tonight and I was begging her for the recipe.. low and behold, it came from here- my favorite site!! ;-) I have always been famous for my cream corn (also from this site), but this Thanksgiving we will definitely be having "yum yum" corn... it's probably one of the best we've ever had (on par with Rudy's Texas BBQ cream corn).  Thanks for the DIVINE recipe!

Based on other rater's indicating that it was too rich I cut down on the butter and cream cheese.  The result was that it didn't have much pizzazz.  I'll try it again, making it as published and will re-rate it then.

I gave this a 3 because my husband liked it.  I thought it was ok.  I followed the recipe as listed and cut back a bit on the sugar. The cream cheese- butter mixture came out "bumpy" not creamy.  Maybe it's because I used the whipped cream cheese.  I'm not sure if I will make this again.....I'd probably opt for regular corn over this.

This was good.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, and instead of a garlic clove, I used 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of cajun spice, 1 tsp of dill and black pepper.  This was all the help it needed.  I might add onion the next time, for a different taste.

This sounded very good when I read it but I was very disappointed in it.  My family said it was "different", which is what they say when they really don't like something.  I won't make this one again.

Certainly very yummy!!! In fact TOO yummy! Unfortunately I either used too much butter or its really fatty, the butter was like a layer and the cream cheese and corn was on top. I beat it really well before I cooked it though.  It is so yummy but really too buttery, I will try it again though, using less butter, as this could have been my mistake!  Otherwise, great recipe!

This is very good. All the ingredients compliment each other. I made it the day before with the exception of baking it in the oven. Did that the next day. You'd never guess it was prepared the day before. Very tasty. I highly recommend this recipe.

I’ve been making a variation of this for the last few years. I’ve done both stove top only and crock pot. I haven’t found a need to drain the water after cooking the corn as it all incorporates nicely. I love to step things up and add a small can of drained, chopped jalapeños and some crispy bacon. It’s so good that I’m asked to make it for every gathering! Thanks for the recipe and enjoy!

I love this recipe... I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas, it's so popular I have to double the recipie.  The only change I make is, I use diced garlic and I add a can of diced green chilles!  It's amazing!
This year I also substituted raw coconut sugar instead of white sugar.

Made this for a potluck, and nothing was left! I used canned corn, as the store was out of frozen. Just heated it till very hot ( do not boil) ,drain, put back into the warm pot, then  fold in all the ingredients till well blended, place in casserole dish and bake! This dish is a mark up from serving just regular corn and goes great with any beef or even chicken or thanksgiving turkey! Yum! Yum!

Absolutely delicious.  I substituted the cream cheese with garlic and herb cream cheese spread and added some chopped sauteed onions.  I also cooked it earlier in the day and then just reheated in the microwave at dinner time.

I make this recipe every year for Thanskgiving and Christmas! It's a huge hit. I follow the directions exactly. Most of the time I double it to feed large groups. The only thing I have found is that it takes longer than the 30 minutes to cook.

My family absolutely loved this dish! I made it exactly as written, with the exception of adding one finely chopped red bell pepper to the mix. Oh so good!

Very good. I did make several changes based on the reviews. I halved the butter and cream cheese and omitted the sugar and salt. I also added a little cayenne pepper for flavor. Simple and tasty.

I made this as a side dish tonight to sweet potato burritos and it went very well.  I made a few minor changes though; I cut the recipe in half, but instead of using a bag of frozen corn, I added 2 cans of corn.  The only other change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp of pureed jalepeno pepper.  The end result was almost exacly like "Mexican Corn" also found on this site, the main difference is that the Mexican Corn recipe is done on the stovetop.

WOW all I can say is "yum-yum!"  I used minced garlic and I got just a little too much but it was wonderful...I also substituted the parsley with garlic salt with parsley.  Will use this again!

Family really liked this; it got eaten all up at a family dinner.  It was a bit rich for me, though -- might try cutting down the cream cheese next time!

My family LOVED this recipe. My mother asked for it once a week for 3 weeks in a row! I didn't add the parsley (out at the time)and I used jarred chopped garlic for lack of fresh, this was still a hit. I didn't really care for the cream cheese all that much but then again that's just me. Gave this a 4 only because I didn't care for this too much.

Fast and easy to make.  Hubby liked but kids who love corn wouldn't try.  Was a little too chewy..Maybe will try with canned corn next time.

Way too rich for me.  Recipe sounded wonderful but didn't live up to what I thought. My family didn't like it a bit either.

DH loved it, I wasn't crazy about it.  I like my corn plain with butter mostly so this was a little rich for me.  It would be good for special occasions though.

This recipe works with any vegetable.  My family loves peas...and I don't. But i made this with corn and it was great so i tried it with canned peas, and it was fabulous. A favorite in my house!

I used canned corn because that was in my pantry. The hubby and I thought it was okay. Something different to do with corn. I baked for 30 min but it still didn't brown. I'd probably make it again but not often.

I would recommend ensuring the cream cheese is really soft and cut into really small pieces, as it tended to stay in clumps and had to be stirred often otherwise.
