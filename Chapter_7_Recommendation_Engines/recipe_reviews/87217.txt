I agree that this recipe makes very very moist chicken.  I used boneless chicken tenders and added ground red pepper and regular black pepper to the marinade.  I also cooked the tenders in a skillet covered with all the extra marinade.  :-)

I love this recipe it works well with fish too. Thicken the marinade up with flour untill it is the consistancy of frosting then use it as a coating when baking whole or cut up chicken. It seals in the juices and adds yummy teriyaki flavor.

This recipe resulted in chicken that was very, very moist and tender.  The flavor was not exceptional, and next time I will add some garlic powder at least. But I WIll try it again. My daughter loved it. My husband said it was good. I thought it was good, but not great.

This is a great recipe that is really easy to make.  I put my chicken in the marinade overnight and add some fresh cracked pepper and some garlic powder (not salt, as you don't want it too salty).  I also like to add a little brown sugar to sweeten it and some crushed red pepper for a little heat.  This is really a great entree that is quick and my children really enjoy it.  I have also cut the chicken into chunks and cooked them, then speared them with a toothpick and served with some peanut satay sauce on the side for a really quick and filling appetizer.

I just made this for dinner tonight and I didn't have any soy sauce so I used teriyaki marinade instead and it turned out wonderful. My husband and 2 picky boys LOVED it. Thank You!!!!

I cooked this in a covered skillet due to the weather, it turned out great.  After reading reviews I made mine with garlic powder and cayenne pepper, great touch!

This sauce was just what I was looking for.  Its not to strong of a taste but gave the chicken a great tenderness and flavor.  I actually used this for Philly Chicken Cheesesteak sandwiches and it made them turn out wonderful!  I have made philly chicken sandwiches before but couldnt find the right sauce to make them taste right.  I cut the chicken up and marinated for about 2 hours before I sauteed them.  I will always be using this sauce in the future!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I used cubed chicken breast, marinated it for 1 hour and cooked it in a little olive oil on the stovetop instead of grilling it. It was so good, I did the same thing with salmon. Kids loved it over white rice.

I didn't really care for this.  My daughters wouldn't eat it.  Maybe I needed to do something differently, but I am not in a hurry to make it again.  The flavor was almost overwhelming...sorry :)

Very Good.  Followed the directions exactly...and chicken was very moist.  Like many other reviewers when I make this again, I will use lower sodium soy sauce.  Chicken was a little too salty for my tastes, but husband (who is a salt freak) loved it.  Even better the next day heated for leftovers.  Hubbie heated it up in the microwave at work, and it smelled so good that everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Came out very moist. I did follow the advice of others and cut back on the soy and sweetened it some too. It was very tasty.

This was awesome! I added garlic powder, chili powder, and some ground ginger and let it marinate a while. 
Only gave it 4 stars because I had to cook it in a skillet inside. It still came out really good, but I'm anxious for it to warm up and put it on the grill!! 

Served it with baked asparagus, and onion rice. So so good!!

I used chipotle mayonnaise in this recipe instead of regular mayo and it added a delicious kick to the flavor. My husband loved it, I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  I dislike it when people change the ingredients and then rate their own version of the recipe.  Having said that, it was way TOO MUCH soy sauce for the 3 adults in my family, and we found it to be very, very salty.  BUT the good news is there is a flavor in that recipe that I like hidden beneath all that salt.  So next time I will lessen that soy sauce, maybe to only 1/4 of a cup or less.  This is a very easy recipe, and the chicken browns so beautifully and was very tender and moist. I did mine in a Rachel Ray grill pan indoors.   It is worth another try, that's for sure!

This was very good.  I had already cooked my chicken the night before so I just added it all to a skillet and let it simmer for a while.  I also added in some brown sugar and about two pineapple slices that I had leftover in the fridge.

I enjoyed, my family not so much.  Using low sodium soy, it was still a bit salty.  I would cut the amount to 1/2 cup next time.

The problem with this recipe is that it's so SALTY as to be virtually inedible.  I'm a salt lover, but I could barely eat it.  My kids wouldn't eat it.  If I make it again, I will cut way, way back on the soy sauce.

This was delicious! I did change a couple things. My chicken breasts were still frozen, so i boiled them for about 10-15 minutes. They were mostly cooked through and cut into strips (as I only had 3 and needed to feed 2 adults and 2 children) Then I added them to the mayo/soy mixture and let them sit for about another 15 minutes. I grilled them on low heat until they were cooked through and OMG!!!! They rocked! My 3 year old couldn't get enough of them. My husband said this recipe would be a keeper :-) Of course my 6 year old wouldn't even try it...maybe next time she will? Thanks for sharing this great easy recipe!

OH MY...this is the yummiest stuff EVER!  We also grilled some halibut using this sauce and it was to die for.   Not exactly teriyaki - it's not sweet like teriyaki but is a very good sauce - we'll be trying it on everything.

This was terrific.  My family loved it!  At first, I was very skeptical having tasted the marinade.  The meat was juicy and tender.  I did tenderize it with a rolling pin first.  It is terrific.

So tried this for the first time but I did it a little different. I just mixed all the chick in the mayo first(seasoned with lemon pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic,onion powder,and uncle Chris steak seasoning) just eyeballed that. Then once the chicken was seasoned I added in 1/2cup of soy sauce. It's really strong so didn't need too much saltiness. Once the chicken was coated I immediately threw it into the pan. I used coconut oil also it's healthier. Let the chicken sit in the Pan covered for about 20 minutes moving it every 5 minutes or so to cook thoroughly. Once it was done cooking put it on high to dry out the extra marinade so it'll stick to the chicken better and voila. Paired with egg rolls and white rice. DELISH! My hubby and baby girl both liked it and she doesn't eat chicken too much. Win for this momma. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent. I cut my chicken breasts into small strips and pan cooked them in the marinade. I used the marinade as suggested but added a couple small handfuls of brown sugar. I laid my strips on top of some seasoned rice and poured the "gravy" right on top. Husband and kids loved it. Will definitely make this a regular meal on our menu.

Super nice! Super moist! I used less soy sauce 1/2 cup because of the brand. And used a mayonnaise that had lemon. Added black pepper, some minced onion and garlic. The guests loved it a lot!

i was a bit unsure about the mayo but with all the great reviews i gave it a shot. i added my own seasonings into the mix to fit our flavors but the basis for the recipe is great. the chicken was very tender and juicy. thx

Wonderful even on an inside-grill. :) Used chicken tenders, 3/4 cup mayo, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce with the suggested garlic sauce and black pepper from the reviews. It was REALLY good. The best part - if you don't use all of it, it's wonderful cut up on a spinach salad. Thank you!

Love this! I actually broiled this and it turned out so tender and flavorful. The only thing I would change would be to cut back on the marinade to 1/2. I had way too much left over and had to throw it out.

WOW!!! This was the tenderest chicken we have ever had. I would use low sodium soy sauce next time but we both loved the flavor and expecially the moistness.

Added black pepper and a little cayenne pepper as well. I didn't have any soy sauce so I used a sweet and sour teriyaki base. It was a hit! The cayenne pepper gave it a nice balance. My family loved it!! The chicken was so moist as well!!! Duke mayo works very well!! Next time I will take a pic.

Had abundance of frozen chicken and uncooked white rice needed something to use the two that had an asian flare without having to purchase a million different ingredients that i'd never use again. This tasted worse than it smelled which i thought almost impossible. Did 1/4 cup soy with 3/4 mayo 1 minced garlic clove and a tbsp of brown sugar. Something tells me those 2 add in's weren't the culprit. For some reason my boyfriend loved it but i found myself forcing it down so as not to let it go to waste. Needless to say, he took the rest to work. Never again. Sorry.

I can not give this recipe full stars because I added 1/2 tsp of ginger 1 tablespoon brown sugar (because I like the stickyness of it) and 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Other than that it was fantastic!!

I tweaked the recipe like others here said - added some brown sugar, minced garlic and powder ginger.  Instead of the breasts, I used thighs.  I then took the thighs out of the marinade and baked at 375 for 25 minutes.

good base recipe. I added one packet of the Lipton's onion flavoring to the sauce before i marinated the chicken {marinated for 2 hours instead of the 30 minutes}; i liked it. Will definitely use this again, maybe adding some curry powder next time. Thanks for uploading this one ^^

This is my first review and I had to do it on this recipe!  I followed the advice of others and added some garlic powder, a bit of sugar, and then threw it into a skillet.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make it again and again.

Amazing what the mayo does for this recipe. My family is anti-mayo and so it really IS a secret. However, it makes the best and juicy grilled chicken ever! I mix 1/2 soy and 1/2 teriyaki as a personal preference. Thank you so much for posting. I have passed the recipe on to many who are just as amazed!!

I thought this was pretty good and definitely resulted in moist chicken.  I marinated the chicken breasts overnight and then cooked them on the Foreman grill.  I did add some garlic powder to the mayo/soy sauce mix.

Pretty good!  I read a lot of reviews and tried to add some flavor with garlic and cayenne... Also some said it didn't taste like teriyaki so I used Kikkomans teriyakki marinade in place of the soy sauce since its main ingredient is soy sauce..  I think the reason not 5 star was my fault... I used lite mayo, also I did this under the broiler... I will try again and do it on the BBQ when the weather is nice!

This was pretty good - I used thin, boneless, pork loin chops and grilled outside. I cut the soy amounts and added some Complete Seasoning. I felt guilty there was a lot of mayo used for a marinade.  But it was good flavor.

The flavor was great and we didn't think it was too salty. Chicken was very moist. Tried adding flour to the marinade as suggested by another reviewer but after baking the chicken it made the marinade into a pasty coat.  My husband scraped it off but liked the flavor anyways.  Will try again without adding the flour.

I also made this at a family BBQ. I let it sit all night in the fridge in ziplock baggies. I used a whole bottle of soy low sodium and a jar of mayo. I did add a bit of garlic powder and perrper. I made 15 lbs of chicken breasts. Everyone asked for the recipe. So moist and not so sweet. Just perfect!!

Maybe I didn't do something right, but this didn't taste very much like teriyaki to me. It didn't taste bad, but it also didn't taste that great either. I won't make it again.

I actually really loved this chicken. I added garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper to the marinade. The chicken has a great color, flavor and is SO moist! It's now a staple in our house.

I halved the recipe and cut boneless chicken into strips. Marinated for 30 minutes, threaded onto skewers and cooked on the George Foreman for 5 minutes. Served with seasoned rice mix. Excellent! Can't wait for warmer weather to cook this on the gas grill. Excellent.

My whole family liked this. I let it marinate for about an hour, and then my husband kept basting the chicken with the marinade as he grilled it. Talk about an easy marindade - just two ingredients I always have on hand. The chicken was moist and tasty. Thanks!

The chicken is super moist! We thought that putting on garlic powder and onion powder on the chicken before putting it in the mixture just added a bit more to it. Also we used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce and liked that before.

I followed the recipe exactly!  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.
I will definitely be repeating this recipe.  I served it with green beans and brown rice.

This recipe was okay, not bad, but not great.  The untypical teriyaki sauce of soy sauce and mayo intrigued me.  I added other small ingredients as others suggested such as brown sugar, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and ground ginger.  Made an interesting taste, but I like the typical teriyaki sauce instead with soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, ground ginger, etc.  Thank you for giving me chance to try something different!

Can't get much easier and still taste wonderful as this recipe.  I added a bit of spices such as ginger, garlic powder... to marinade.  While the chicken was on the grill I happened to notice a bottle of teriyaki sauce in my fridge.  I used a bit of it to baste as it grilled.  Excellent recipe.  Chicken was tender and moist and delish !

It did not have a teriyaki taste at all and was too salty.We couldn't handle more than a few bites due to the saltiness.

Who knew this combination would be so good! You really don't need any other seasoning than what is in these 2 ingredients.  I've made it twice in the last week, and my husband and I are both fans!  I love how juicy the chicken was and with the outside crispy and flavorful, it made it a new favorite!

I did make some adjustments to the recipe , but thought the base was a great start that I wouldn't think to put together. I read some other reviews and used less soy sauce added about. 1/4 cup of honey , red pepper flakes and minced garlic. I did cook in a pan covered with all he marinade, It was very moist and tasted just like teriyaki chicken. Will make again for sure!

It's not too bad. I think next time I'm only going to put 1/2 of soy sauce and I added 2tsp of brown sugar. Turned out pretty good.

Personally I did not like this but I am giving it 4 stars because my picky husband loves it and has requested it several times now. I've used the recipe as both a marinade and as a sauce for cubed chicken. In both I found it was way too salty and tasted like mayonnaise. I added garlic and onion pepper to the sauce to try to give it a little more flavor but all I still taste is salt and mayonnaise. Hubby loves it on the cubed chicken served over rice.

Although this recipe was good and my family, except my 6 yr. old, liked it, I am giving it 4 stars for 2 reasons. One, it tastes NOTHING like teriyaki, and two, it was  pretty salty. That being said, this made a very moist and tender chicken with a nice flavor. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added about 1tsp. garlic powder. I feel it definitely needed this. I also made it on my Foreman grill. Next time, I will probably use a little less soy sauce, maybe a half cup. Thanks for sharing.

I just found this secret recipe and it sounded simple - but I read a couple reviews so I added a few additions- 1 tbsp of lemon juice, minced garlic & garlic salt.  I BBQd it on foil for approx 15 mins, then put it directly on the racks for quick bbq lines - side of fresh veggies and rice.  Family ate it all up !

Ok, I kind of cheated: I used Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce.  I added some cracked black pepper like another reviewer suggested.  But overall, this is a recipe I would use again... when the hankering for grilled teriyaki chicken arose.  Nothing to write home about in this incarnation of it, but with some heartfelt tweaking it might be one of those great cookout secret-weapons.

Wow, I had a little trouble beleiving that the mayo would do any justice with the chicken. I was highly suprised with the results. I used chicken wings and added garlic, and cooked them on a BBQ grill. It was absolutely amazing how the flavor came through, and was also juicy. I will be adding this to my cookbook asap. My wife & I give it two thumbs up, well done!!!

Good recipe. I made the following changes: 1) Used light mayo instead of regular 2) Added garlic powder, brown sugar, and cayenne pepper to the marinade 3) Thickened the marinade with flour. The rest I left the same, marinating it for 30min. I did flatten/tenderize the raw chicken breasts with the back of a knife, and the results were great. Next time I might use a little less soy sauce, as it did end up slightly saltier than I usually prefer.

You MUST add garlic ... soy without garlic is NOT teriyaki. There is also a recipe on here called Easy Teriyaki Marinade which is EXCELLENT.

This was good.  The merinade gives it a nice grill flavor I cooked it on a gas grill.  Very moist, my picky 8 yr old liked it.  I agree that it doesn't have a teriyaki flavor.

Nice juicy Chicken - not much flavor tho.

Next time I'll probably let it sit in the marinade longer than 30 min.

also I put in the oven to broil for 
5 min each side instead of grilling it.

This was a super easy recipe and the chicken was delicious. Sweet, tender and juicy. I added one teaspoon of Mrs Dash's grill seasoning and even my wife enjoyed it. She normally doesn't take to anything that has much seasoning. My one nit was that it was a bit too salty for us. Next time, as some others have mentioned, I'll use low-sodium  Soy Sauce. But you better believe there will be a next time!

Wow - this was great!  I marinated it all day and it was tender and juicy off the grill.  Was a bit salty, so I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time.  But a great, easy recipe!  Thanks!

My whole family enjoyed it. I followed the advice of others and put garlic powder and cayenne in the sauce. I also thought the sauce was a little soupy and I ran out of mayo, so I used a couple of spoonfuls of Miracle Whip to thicken it up. My daughter, who is not a meat eater, said the meat was her favorite part of the meal.

I followed the suggestion for cayene & garlic (instead of powder I used minced).  This was good, I'll let it marinate longer next time, didn't have time for more than 10 min.  I don't think it had a Teriyaki flavor but it went great with the Thai rice that I made.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

This didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I followed the recipe exactly, but somehow the marinade imparted a strange flavor that I wasn't crazy about. Husband & son liked it, though.
