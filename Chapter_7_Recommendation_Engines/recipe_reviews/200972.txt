Yum! I made this for a dinner party and everybody was just raving.  The cannelloni is incredibly rich, but coupled with the mint pesto, it is just perfect. Will definitely file this one away for another special occassion!

I made this because it sounded unusual but good. However, I was disappointed. The filling would not stay in the rolls (no binder) and the mint pesto seemed to overpower everything.

I loved the flavour of the lamb with the mint pesto.  Tasty!
