While this is neither an extraordinary recipe nor cooking method it is still nevertheless a fresh, flavorful, and pretty-on-the-plate side dish pasta. There is no science here...use whatever herbs you have on hand or whatever your preference is. No need to measure, just chop and add fresh herbs (or throw in a pinch or two of dried) to your liking. It was a nice change from the garlic and olive oil pasta I traditionally serve. I omitted the olives and served with Jerusalem Chicken II, also from this site. Simple and delicious.

one thing that is great to do is to boil garlic cloes in the water with the pasta, this adds flavor to the pasta itself

This has a great flavor!  I wanted a whole meal rather than a side dish, so I cooked thin strips of chicken, then added some thinly sliced carrots and celery, diced red pepper, snow peas and mushrooms.  Versatile recipe.  It smells wonderful while cooking!  I omitted the olives since I didn't have and don't really care for them anyway.  I plan to cut my butter to about 2 Tbsp and add 1/4 c broth to lesson the fat next time.

We loved this and I will make this again!  I only used 1/4 cup butter (olive oil would be a tasty and healthy alternative).  I used all dried herbs because that's what I had.  I also couldn't resist adding some parmesan cheese.  The olives were a nice touch!

I printed this recipe out last May and just made it this weekend.  This is right up my Husband's alley, he loved it!  I will sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top next time I make it.  Great alternative to rice and potatoes!

My family loved this pasta. Even my picky eater. (my husband) I only had dried seasonings, but will use fresh next time to make it even better. Sliced grilled chicken over it, made an easy easy delicious meal.

This pasta is very good! I usually don't like that much pasta but I loved this dish! It is very simple to make. The only thing is that it seems like it is messing something. That something is parmeseam cheese on the top! It makes a huge difference. I'm going to make it again tonight!

Excellent sidedish for just about anything!  The fresh herbs really make this dish stand out.  I halved the butter at first but soon realized that you do need an entire cube.  My husband loved this!  (I don't care for olives, so I omitted them.)

I tried with gluten-free pasta, and added sautéed shrimp into the final mix, topped with fresh parmesan. A simple yet elegant meal. Serve with bread (toasted in oven for 1-2 min each side) and homemade garlic butter (recipe available on site).

This was a good recipe. I made it a few weeks ago and I'm really trying to remember it which says a lot in itself.  I know we liked it but it wasn't stand-out.  I made exactly as described, but if I make this again I think I'll reduce the butter and add something to give it a little more "zip".

This recipe was a delicious break from the standard starch side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly since I had all the fresh herbs in my garden and the dried herbs in my pantry.  My family loved it.  Next time I will add a little olive oil to the butter for additional flavor.

Dried herbs probably aren't as good as fresh, but it was still a good dish using those as a substitute.

Nice light pasta dish, but I like this type of pasta dish better with some parm. cheese in it. I liked all the herbs, I used all dried because that's all I had, and I left out the savory. Kids liked it which is always a huge plus. Oh yeah used spaghetti noodles...

This was great.  I didn't have the parsley or the thyme and it was still delicious!  I also added a bit of parm cheese to it.  I will make this again!

I cheated. I used a stick of unsalted butter, 4 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of dried "Italian Seasoning" out of a jar. Just let it simmer while your pasta boils and serve with a sprinkling of fresh Parmesan cheese. Couldn't be easier or more yummy!

My 7-year-old son didn't care much for the herbs in this recipe, although he is kind of a picky eater in that way. My husband and I both thought it was really good. I would definitely use less butter next time and more olive oil. It's a very fresh recipe; it takes away from it knowing how many calories you're consuming. All in all--a good recipe!!

Wow!  Best pasta I ever had!  Although, being somewhat health conscious I modified the recipe a little bit: sub in olive oil.  Regular olive oil for cooking and extra olive oil at the end for extra (as if there's isn't enough already) aroma.  I also doubled the herbs.  It was such a hit that my wife who NEVER have the same food 2 days in a row, ate it 3 days straight!!  Thanks for this recipe!

Very tasty. We thought it would be better with some Parmesan, so we added that at the table. In the future I'd probably spice it up with some crushed red pepper, because love heat in our food. Thanks for the recipe!

I was always looking for a simple way to dress up pasta when serving it as a side dish, and this was great! I used a whole box (pound) of pasta, 8 cloves of garlic, and kept the herbs at about a tablespoon, like the recipe said. I used the herbs recommended and also made some subsitutions. I didn't have any black olives, but I'm sure they'd be delicious mixed in. Very tasty!

I love this recipe! It's a great side dish and makes a great cold lunch. I'm not a big fan of olives so I make this dish without them. The only other change I made was using wheat pasta.

I made some slight changes to this recipe (the changes are for a quantity to serve 2 people -but could easily feed more, if used as a side dish)  One thing to note is that when you use dried herbs, the flavour is more concentrated - so do NOT use the suggested quantity, unless you are using fresh herbs!   I used dried herbs, and rather than measure out each herb, I chose to use an italian seasoning - I used about 1/2 tsp (which was plenty!).  To lower the fat, I used 1 Tbsp butter, and added about 
2-3 Tbsp water and about 2 tsp of chicken bouillion granules and then added the herbs.  I steamed some yellow squash and green zucchini, which I tossed w/ the pasta and herb mixture as well.  This was very good as a side dish to the cajun baked catfish I made!

Very good!  It's nice to find a recipe using so many fresh herbs that I have available.  I did have fresh marjoram so I used that instead of dry.  Super simple and tasty!

I made this as a side dish for a special meal with my family, but didn't add the olives, or savory, and my family( and me) LOVED it! It was gone, every speck, within half of dinner. I'm definetely going to make it again.

Maybe it was because I used both dried pasta and herbs, but we all thought this was just ok. I am however going to give this another go soon with fresh pasta and herbs and cut down to a 1/3 cup of butter. I have a feeling we might prefer it that way. Thanks for letting me try.

3/4 a pound (12oz) of pasta is more appropriate. Excellent light flavor.

This was a very different blend of flavors that we certainly weren't used to, so the first couple of bites, we both weren't sure what we thought, but we both ended up finishing our portions. This had a Mediterranean type flavor to it and actually we grew to like this dish. I'll probably fix this again. Thanks for a new recipe.

Keep it simple - wonderful concept. 

I did use 3 tbsp olive oil w/ 3 tbsp margerine to make it healthier. I also didn't have marjoram, savory or black olives and added 1 tsp of oregano. 

Also added a few chopped muchrooms & some broccoli flowers, grated. 

Was lovely. I will use this again, and try out different combinations. 

Thank you!

We really, really liked this! I needed to use a small amount of leftover angel hair pasta & this really did it justice. I halved the recipe but used about 2 Tablespoons fresh basil, left out the savory (don't own any) & though we like black olives, personally I saw no reason to include them. I don't care how "basic" & "simple" it is - IMO the recipe deserves a 5-star rating because it tastes so darn good! This will be one of the regulars around here for sure!

This was really good!!! I followed some of the advice of other reviewers 1) using a third of the recommended herb if not using fresh and 2) sprinkling with parm cheese. I did not have savory on hand, but it tasted great without it. My daughter hates olives, so I had the olives on the side so those who wanted them could add to the pasta. A great side dish!!! We had it with the Teriyaki Pork Tenderloin and Mom's Great Green Beans, both are on this site, and it made a great meal!!

I've made this pasta at least 3 times now, and I love it. I usually only have one or two of the fresh herbs, so I just use about a third dried for the ones I don't have fresh. One of these days I'll have them all fresh and I'm sure it will be even better! Also, I've never added the olives just because I'm not a big olive person and I rarely have them on hand - but I plan to try it with the olives sometime too.

Wonderful and easy side dish.  I did half the butter to 1/4 cup and felt the amount was just perfect for 8 oz of pasta.  I forgot to put the dried herbs in but after adding a little parmesean cheese on top it was perfect.  I will make again because I love the extra flavor the fresh herbs add.  I will be experementing as well with the herbs I add. 

I served with grilled pork chops and a green salad.

Everyone else raved about this recipe but I didn't think it was all that. It definitely needed the parmesan cheese to give it that something it was missing. Just an average pasta side dish.

My husband wants me to make this weekly, because it is so amazing!!  I have an herb garden so it is easy to make.  I doubled the herbs and added half butter and half basil infused olive oil that enhanced the flavors.  I also use an entire can of black olives.  We top it with sliced grilled chicken that my husband grills while I make the pasta dish.  A must for company so don't be surprised if I make this for you.

Not to bad! I used all dry herbs and substituted half the butter with olive oil. Also added parmesean cheese like other reviewers suggested. Quick and good!

I used whole wheat pasta, I don't know if that makes a difference... The flavor was just so bland overall.

Also, I used a mixture of fresh and dry spices. Maybe it would have been better just completely one way or the other.

I thank the author for sharing, but I would not recommend this recipe.
