I think this is a great recipe, aside from the overwhelming taste of baking soda. I had to reduce it to 1/2 a tsp to get a normal tasting cookie...

Okay, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers of this recipe, and added a little less baking soda. WOW these cookies are amazing!! I added raisins and pecans, because the cookies just seemed to ask for them! Great recipe.

Good cookie - my adjustments: one egg instead of two, only 1/2 tsp baking soda, only 1/2 tbls water, and I added 1 tsp vanilla, I used oil instead of shortening and refrigerated for an hour before baking so they wouldn't run together.

I made these for a women's retreat that I went to a few weeks ago.  I left some at home for my husband and he couldn't stop eating them.  I sent the leftovers home with my mom and my brothers & Dad loved them too.  There was a faint taste of ginger in them, but I don't know where it came from. Bottom line, I'd definitely make them again.

It was an easy recipe.  Not to crazy about all the shortening.  Would make again but with butter instead of shortening.

After reading some of the reviews I reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp and also used only 1 egg.  I added a tsp of almond extract and as I didn't have enough shortening, I topped it off with margarine.  The end result was pretty tasty.  I made them for a play date and all the kids and moms really liked them.  The did spread more than I had realized they were going to so my pan became one big cookie that I had to seperate, but even so they were a soft, chewy, brown sugary delight.

Reduced baking soda and loved the outcome. I liked that it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and turned out being soft and a little fluffy.  My husband just about ate the whole batch. Thanks for offering it.

I added more brown sugar and I added some chocolate chips.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Wonderful cookies.  Big hit with daughter.

Taste good, but really soft. Too much shortening, in my opinion. Would like to try again with butter, almond extract, and vanilla.

This recipe is very fun!  It  tastes more like a cinnamon cookie than a brown sugar cookie.  Too much baking soda though.

This recipe was great and easy.  After a first try they weren't quite right but then I added some almond extract to it and they really worked.  The almond did not distract from the taste, it added lots to it.  When I make them I can barely keep them in the house they go so fast.

OMG! This was the best recipie I have ever had for brown sugar drops. They were soft (but not mushy) and chewy. I recomend adding a little bit of ginger and a little bit more cinnamon. We couldn't stop eating them! We also only baked for nine minutes instead of 10-12

I did lessen the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon. The flavor is amazing. I will make them again. I'm going to use them for ice cream sandwiches! Should be a crowed pleaser.

I made them exactly per instructions, oh wait - no I added an extra half cup of flour and two cups of chocolate chips...12 minutes baking time. Dough was soft, not a firm cookie dough. I didn't have time to refrigerate, it could have helped. I think maybe there was a little too much baking soda - I couldn't really taste it but it seemed just a bit "off." Overall, a good tasting cookie...might try again with reducing soda and adding a bit more sugar. I wanted a brown sugar drop cookie I never heard of them before, and a friend gave me some of hers (she added chocolate chips) and I wanted the same thing...not quite though. Thanks for the recipe. :)

Easy to make, but had a very strong taste of baking powder.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

These cookies were ok but not great. I think they are a good starting point but definitely need something else like chocolate chips or nuts.

Too much lard, or too little flour.  The cookies ended up melting into eachother and turned cakelike, so after the first batch was in for five mins (and we noticed) we mixed everything together onto one cookie sheet.  Smells and tastes great...its cooking now and we have high hopes of this becoming good Brown Sugar Squares!!

I thought these were really good and nice and soft, but I did add more flour as it seemed pretty thin to me. My family gobbled them up in no time!

I  should have read the reviewws befoe I started this recipe... I made the cookie dough just as instructed and tasted it the soda was overwhealming so I came in and read the reviews and saw that I was not the only who had  the soda problem so I went back and made another half of the recipe and added it to the  first  bowl.. much better...  then I it in the fridge to  set for half an hour...  when I put them  on the cookie sheet I sprinkled  a few  gingrsnap crumbs that I had left over from another recipe    that turned out to be a very nice touch I am going to take them to a cookie exchng  tomarrow     but will take an altered recipe with them...

I too removed soe baking soda from the recipe.  Many bakers discussed how the dough was soft and a little "runny."  Pop the dough into the refridgerator for a few hours and it is very easy to use.  DO NOT restir the dough.  The baking soda will be working!

These puffed up nicely while baking but flattened out as they cooled. Kind of too sweet and gummy, even after adding a little more flour. I won't try these again.

I used butter instead of shortening and my cookies came out soft but not runny. I heated the baking soda and water actually to boiling in the microwave and it diluted the taste significantly. These were very good.

These were more like cake than cookies. They are soft and puffy. They could also be a little sweeter.  Probably a good cookie to put icing on. If I decide to try this recipe again, I will omit one egg so it won't be so puffy. I also used only 1 teasp. baking soda.  It was plenty.
