This was great.  i made this for a track team dinner and everybody loved it.  i used only 3/4c of sugar, and left out the nuts and raisins, but added chocolate chips.  everybody wants the recipe now!  oh, i would recommend only baking for 35 min... or at least checking it after that long so it doesn't overcook.

I didn't have any applesauce so I used 5 bananas instead.  All were very ripe and two had been frozen; when thawed they were very juicy.  Added extra cinnamon.

Very tasty - my husband went back for more! Lived dangerously in putting this in my largest nut bread pan - it almost went over. Next time I'll make 2 loaves in a regular sized pan.

This recipe was great. I followed the measurements almost exactly. I added extra spices, used spenda instead of sugar, half whole wheat and half white flour, and used 2 loaf pans insead of 1. It was so moist but not dense. amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my loaf came out very spongy.  I think another reviewer had mentioned theirs being gummy and that seems to have been the case with us, too.  I'm not really sure why it turned out this way.  I suppose the bread could be described as "moist" in some way - which I'm not opposed to - but the texture just wasn't right, and frankly, I didn't find the flavor to be all that great, either.

I loved this recipe!  I changed it a little adding more cinnamon, chocolate chips and pecans (no raisin or walnuts).  It has a great spicy banana flavor with my personal favorite -CHOCOLATE!  This bread was gone from a party in 30 minutes - with people asking for the recipe!  I did use two pans and baked for only 40 minutes.  I cannot say it enough - I really love this recipe!!!

This bread is SO yummy!! The raisins in it add such a great flavor. It's so tasty for being butter and oil free. It's moist and we loved it!

Wundervoll! KÃ¶stlich! I love this recipe. I only had 2 bananas and 1/2 T of Vanilla extract, and didn't alter the rest of the recipe accordingly, but it still turned out wonderfully! ^_^

This recipe was awesome! I have used a banana bread recipe in the past that was too dense, so I was looking for something a little less so. This recipe is much better than the one I used previously. The bread is extremely moist and very easy to make.

This is Wonderful! Make sure to add the Walnuts and Raisins as it really adds to the flavor. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and Nutmeg for a little more flavor. It really does call for two medium pans, not one. cooking time was about 45 minutes in the center of the oven. Great with butter or Cream cheese. ENJOY!

I have made this recipe four times a couple times as origally written and a couple times with my slight modification of 1/2 cup  raisins and 1/2 cup golden raisins to add a little variety and I like the raisin mix better. This is a nice moist bread that feezes well. Its worth the time to make this.

I had to cook this longer than the 45 minutes to get the inside to set, but in doing that, the outside got crunchy.  Not sure if covering it would have helped - maybe next time.  Not the best banana bread recipe I've found, but not bad at all either.

This was such a great, healthy alternative to the other banana breads on this site!  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, and used unrefined raw cane sugar instead of the white sugar (subbed it 1:1) and it was GREAT, and healthier!  I doubled the spices, as suggested by others, and doubled the recipe to make 3 9x5 loaves.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a very good banana bread! We ate it about 10 minutes out of the oven.  I changed a couple of things:  Used half wheat flour and half white flour.  Added a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  And used a snack size applesauce cup as I didn't want to open the large one! Very good, I will make this again!

This was excellent!  I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1/3 cup. Added 1 tsp of cinnamon rather than 1/2 tsp..  This was a great tasting, lowfat alternative to traditional bannana bread! I was not expecting something without butter or oil to taste this yummy! Thanks!

A really great banana bread.  I loved the addition of the nutmeg, although, I did reduce it to 1/4 tsp so that others in the family (who don't love nutmeg as much as I do) would also enjoy this bread.  I left out the optional raisins and walnuts, but plan on using either walnuts or pecans next time.  Love that there is not butter, but the bread was not rubbery or gummy in texture.  Would highly recommend this one!

This is a healthy version I was looking for.  I don't cook with salt so do not miss it in this recipe.
Followed recipe just as written. Using spices and raisins in a Banana Bread was new for me~~~~but what a great taste.  I already had cinnamon and nutmeg in my homemade applesause so did not use extra.  This is defitely a KEEPER.

I was excited to try this recipe but found it to be pasty and gummy,I did not like it and my kids did not ask for more.  I did not include raisins or nuts(preference).

Very dense, unpleasantly chewy.  

I'm a novice at cooking, so I don't know how to fix how seemingly rubber-like it is.  It is not what I had expected, at any rate.

Well, this is delicious. I hate to be one of those people, but I did add a tablespoon or so of olive oil to try to keep the bread from being gummy (which happens sometimes). This was REALLY good, even in the batch where I forgot to add the eggs. Chocolate chips aren't even necessary, although it's delicious with them.

I've baked many banana breads and Im always on the lookout for a healthy recipe, but I didn't find a keeper in this one. I followed the recipe to a T (omitting the raisins and walnuts) and found this cake to be too spongy and a bit on the dry side... likely because it baked unevenly... It took a total of 60 minutes to bake, and even then the top was still a bit raw, but I needed to take it out to attempt to keep the rest at least edible.....

We love this!  I love that it is lower in fat and still tastes killer. I don't understand all the other banana bread recipies w/o cinnamon or nutmeg.  I have also used canned pumpkin in place of applesauce and we think it tastes even better! We have never tried it with the optional ingredients, though. Works great as muffins too.

I added another 1/3 cup of applesauce as batter was very dry, the extra applesauce was good. I found it lacked banana flavour next time I might add another banana. It was a good sized loaf and nice and moist

I didn't have nutmeg and I love cinnamon so I doubled the cinnamon. I also only had half a cup of sugar so I added maple syrup. I also used 5 bananas like one person said since I didn't have applesauce. I listened to the other reviewers and only baked it for 40 minutes. Actually the edges were a bit hard. I recommend 35 minutes like someone else said and maybe checking it after 20 minutes. It was so tasty though! The bananas were moist and it had an overall good taste. It was my first banana bread.

With slight variations due to my lack of ingredients required, this recipe is very good.  Next time I will make sure I have everything and see how much better it is!

this is an awesome recipe for a really healthy alternative to oil and butter banana bread.  I really like it and you can eat all you want since the is virtually no fat in it.  LOVE IT!!! I added one extra banana so good

This was EXCELLENT!  It was very moist and flavorful.  The spices were a really nice addition, and you could certainly taste the nutmeg/cinnamon.  I hate to have deviated from the recipe, but I only had two bananas, so their contribution was pretty mild.  I also did half whole-wheat flour and half regular flour.  Combining this with the optional walnuts/craisins, the bread was wonderfully hearty.  My family really enjoyed this and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

It does not taste like banana bread.  It baked at to high of a temp and burnt edges.  Outside was leathery.  It tasted spicey, not like banana.  Horrible recipe.

This recipe was great! What a moist, delicious bread. I added golden raisins with chopped walnuts. Simply delicious. I even froze the second loaf for later.

Theresa, this recipe was a great find.  Your great-grandma certainly cooked with a conscience.  Sometimes I add the raisins, sometimes the nuts, sometimes both.  Today, I wanted 'sweet' so I added chocolate chips but replaced the sugar with Splenda.  These came out so good. This is my forever recipe for banana bread. I agree with watching the cooking times.  I had 6 large bananas so I upped the recipe by half and made two slightly smaller loaves.  They were done in 40 minutes.  Thanks!

I added chopped chocolate chips, omitted the spices and substituted 1 cup of a very light whole wheat flour for the white flour.  It turned out really well except I slightly over baked it because I hit a densely banana spot with my tester and erroneously thought it wasn't yet done.  It's a good recipe -- lower fat or not!

This recipe yields the best banana bread I ever made.  It is full of banana flavor yet doesn't have all of the oil and fat that most other recipes do.

Very tasty bread, with a nice top crust. Followed other reviews and added 1/2 C. Applesauce and used 4 bananas plus pecans and chocolate chunks.  Will increase to 5 bananas next time to increase banana flavor.

Maybe it was because i didn't use four full bananas (had to cut out the rotten parts) but it came out very dry and there is not much to the taste. The raisins do help but next time I'll just go for a regular banana bread recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I keep my flour premixed 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat. Used one of those single serving applesauce cups as it seemed about the right size. I set the timer for 50 minutes as it said 45-60 minutes and my oven tends to run slow. Wish I'd have set it for 45 minutes, as it could have come out a couple minutes earlier. Still, quite yummy!!

I'm a health nut, however the bread itself is not sweet and tastes more like a piece of white bread than banana bread.  I added nuts, and that didn't help.  Ended up having to cut in slices and toss in cinnamon sugar mixture just so my guests would enjoy it.  Make the full fat banana bread.  You'll eventually eat the same amount of fat in this bread because you keep tasting it trying to get a "taste."

Pretty good banana bread.  I cut this recipe in half, since I only had two bananas, and made into muffins (made about 12). I also put half white and half whole wheat flour in to up the healthyness. I like that there isn't any oil added, we're trying to eat right! My husband ate about 10 of them since I made them last night. I still prefer zucchini bread though.

Delicious!  I made an extra healthy version, substituting whole wheat flour, and 1 cup brown rice syrup plus 1/2 tsp more of baking soda for the sugar.  My husband couldn't tell the difference!

Okay. So, I wanted to add a little fat to this just for my baking preferance.
I doubled this, cut out half the bananas and used one stick butter and one stick margerine and added a little salt. I used my own homemade crockpot applesauce and just a little apple pie spice, as my applesauce was already spiced up. Everything else I kept the same. The smell of this while baking was incredible. I won't be trying this myself as these will be gifts, but I'll update this recipes as soon as I hear how my friends liked them. This recipe made two large loaves and one mini, when doubled.

I read everyone else's reviews, but still decided to give it a try....I was disappointed with this recipe because like others said, it doesn't have a real "banana" flavor...it is a lower fat recipe using applesauce instead of oil which I liked...but it didn't have a lot of taste to it in my opinion.

Bread is in the oven, and I really can't wait to have a slice. But... I used a form that was a bit to small, and I didn't want to waste anything, so i added some granola and baked pancakes. Amazing!

The batter was delicious (we licked the bowl clean) and it was great hot right out of the oven with a glass of cold milk.  However, when eating it the next day, it was dense and a bit gummy/chewy.  My son, who loves banana bread, did not care for it at all.  I found it was better warmed up with butter, otherwise, it is not as good served at room temperature or cooler.

This bread was very good, we can't stop eating it!  I followed the recipe except I cut it in half (I only had 2 bananas) and I did use half regular flour and half whole wheat flour.  I also did add some choc. chips - YUM!

Very good banana bread.  I like that it uses applesauce instead of the traditional butter.  I only had 2 bananas and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, but I added a bit extra applesauce and a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and it still tasted great.  It did get a tiny bit dry towards the end of its life, but that is what I expected for not having all of the added fat.  Will definitely make this again.

I LOVE this recipe! Like many people, I vary the ingredients.  Since my husband and I love dark bread, I use brown sugar instead of white.  I also use VERY ripe bananas.  Leave them in the fridge for about a week or two until the rind is black.  It makes the bananas much sweeter.  Rather than applesauce, I use apple butter.  Using fresh-grated nutmeg will make your house smell heavenly while the bread is baking.  This is also perfect for turning into fruitcake.  Along with the raisins and nuts, add a cup of fruitcake mix to the batter.  If you add fruitcake mix, it will definitely have to bake for a full hour because the batter will be dense.

I used 1/2 c white sugar  1/2 c brown sugar.   no applesauce, so I used 1/3 c canola oil. I live at high altitude, so I added 3 Tb vanilla yogurt and 3 Tb Skim Milk. Didn't add the raisins/walnuts. Husband LOVED this recipe. next time i will add chocolate chips, yum!

I thought that it was a good, healthy alternative to the full fat banana bread.  I would make it again but with some alterations.

I just did not enjoy this banana bread.  It had no flavor and was so dense and sort of rubbery.  Could barely cut it, I had to pull pieces off it was so dense and rubbery.  I followed the recipe exactly and I was just unimpressed.  I did give it two stars because I enjoyed the addition of raisins, which I would have never thought of with banana bread.  I tried to make muffins in cupcake wrappers with the extra once my loaf pan was full, my little girls love to have banana bread "cupcakes", and they turned out awful.  Half the muffin pulled off with the paper as they were sealed completely to the wrapper, maybe that was a result of no oil in the recipe, never had that happen before.  It was just a bad waste of my ripe bananas and some disappointed girls who had been so excited for banana bread.  I should have stuck to the recipe I always use but I thought I'd give an oil free recipe a try as a healthier choice.

It's ok. I wanted a lighter option for banana bread but when I compare calories with my favorite recipe on this site ("Banana Banana Bread") they are practically the same. Next time I think I'll try "Banana Banana Bread" and substitute applesauce for the butter and see how it tastes.

Awesome recipe.  I made muffins for my boys (they have more fun that way). Baked for 13 min and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg.  They Love them!  Excellent for a decently healthy recipe!

My hubby and I absolutely love this! And it's healthy, too! I've tried making it with both 4 and 3 bananas, and prefer it with only 3 bananas, adding a little plain yogurt to get the batter to the right consistency. I increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp., because I love sweet breads a little spicy. I make it into 2 loaves, and bake it for 45 minutes.

This bread was delicious!  I used 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour and added chopped pecans (no raisins).  It was surprisingly moist and yummy.  I look forward to baking this bread again.

Mmmm!  Thanks for the lower fat, healthy recipe! Followed directions just about exactly (minus nuts/raisins and 1/2 the sugar) and baked to a perfect texture in 1 hour.  Great spice mix!!

Very satisfying.  Full of flavor.  This is a keeper.  I used whole grain flour.  It baked up beautifully.  It makes a wonderful loaf to give as a gift as well as for home.  You never miss the oil/fat.  YUM!

Very tastey! But the 12 serving recipe definitely calls for 2 pans instead of one. Total cook time was about 1hr 10min with one pan. I was worried about burning the bread since I had to keep putting it back in the oven. Aside from this, this is a very good recipe. I used 3 bananas instead of 4 and the texture was just right, not gummy at all :-)

I was happy to try this recipe since it claimed moistness and was lowfat. However, the texture was so gummy even after I put it in for the remaining 15 minutes. I am highly dissappointed as this was a waste of 8 good bananas(I doubled the recipe).

Made this today, smelled soooo good baking!! I was looking for moistness and I was not disappointed! Made it exactly the way the recipe listed ,but, I didn't add the raisins . Baked it in a larger loaf pan for the lower end of the time in the baking instructions (45min.) it tested done when I inserted a table knife in the center and it came out clean . It was a bit underdone close to the surface but, that was easily fixed by baking for the remaining 15 min.it should remedy any pastyness other people have had problems with .I won't go back to my old recipe!!  Will definately make this again and again .

The taste is great.  My complaint with this recipe has to do with the size of the loaf...way, way too big for one pan.  Mine burnt on the outside in order to get it done on the inside.  The recipe should specify two pans, not one.  But I'm not that upset because banana is not my favorite flavor; we made this just to creatively use them up.

This recipe was so good!  I did not use optional raisins, but I did use pine nuts in lieu of optional walnuts (I had a surplus).  It turned out fantastic!  I did brown the pine nuts a tad prior to adding.  I used a spring form cake pan and only had to bake this for about 35 minutes (maybe a little less).  I did the toothpick test and it was wonderful!  So moist and yummy!  Thanks for this recipe, I never knew banana bread would be so easy!  This will be a staple in our house.

Worked perfectly for me.  I doubled the spices though. The cake is tasty enough (even if you could add 1 banana for extra taste), not too sweet, not greasy.
Now mind the quantity ! For one  loaf pan I thought it would be too much and used TWO and Im glad I did.
As I had 2 different  pans, I added a handful of rhum and raisins in one and chocolate chips in the other. Both great ideas.

This bread was definitely missing salt !!  It only took about two bites for me to notice it.  In addition, I used half brown sugar and half white. and it gave the bread a lot more taste. I baked mine at 350 degrees for 40 minutes then reduced the temperature  to  325 degrees and continued baking another 15 minutes. That change kept it from being gummy inside.  Had to make too many changes for it to be the right recipe for me.

These are awesome! Very quick and simple to make and so delicious! You could add pretty much anything to them to make them your own and they'd be fabulous. I made them into muffins. Same temp but put them in for only 30 minutes. Came out beautiful and perfectly golden brown on top! Also, I doubled the spice's as other reviewers suggested and highly recommend it.

I have been making this bread for the past couple of years.  It is really good.  I have been using half regular flour and half whole wheat and it comes out tasting really good.  Walnuts are a great addition!  Last year I added chocolate chips and that was really good also.  Tip- fill your muffin tins slightly above 3/4 full and they come out perfect.

i LOVE this recipe and use it all the time. I add dark chocolate chips and walnuts (no raisins) and my hubby loves it as a hearty addition to his breakfast. I take it to work for a mid-morning snack. I use this recipe for zucchini bread, too!

I varied a few things like my wheat free flour mix and apple-mango sauce & left out the raisins & walnuts.  My three friends loved the bread so much they ate it all up & asked me for the recipe.

Hello Everyone:  I made this bread today.  I doubled the spices and I am glad I did.  The bread does not have much depth of  flavor without them.  I put in five small very ripe bananas and added one tablespoon of olive oil.  Also, I used two cups of white flour and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  Otherwise, I left the recipe as is.  I did not think the bread was as gummy as some reviewers indicated, just ever so slightly.  I baked the bread at 350 degrees instead of 375 degrees so the top of the bread and sides in the pan did not get too done/brown during the baking process.    I added the walnuts but not the raisins (because we are not fans), but I can see where the raisins would add some sweetness missing from the bread.  It quite raised nicely and overall I enjoyed the recipe so I am going to keep it with a few modifications for future loaves.

DELICIOUS!!!  I didn't have baking soda so I used baking powder (doubled what soda should have been) and I only had half a cup of sugar so I used half regular and half brown sugar. Didn't add raisins or nuts.  This was so yummy that it was all gone before the night was over. My husband and two teenagers gobbled it up, with my help:)

This was a very moist and easy bread to make. I took it to be shared with family during breakfast. Tasty and light, everyone enjoyed it. My only change to this recipe was to use 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of turbinado sugar.

So moist and gooey I couldn't believe there was no added fat!
I only had three bananas so I added a small can of peaches. I used baking splenda instead of sugar for the diabetic needs and added only half the amount required. I would definitely make this again!

I used three ripe bananas and left out the nuts. The bread was really moist and tasted great! It also cooked much faster than time listed. Make sure to keep an eye in the bread or it might burn. Great recipe and easy to follow. :)

I just made this recipe, pretty close to how it says to: only changes I made were only using 2 bananas (it's all I had), and I used a heaping 1/2 c. of applesauce. I baked it at 350, because almost every time I use my loaf pan, whatever's inside it gets too crispy on the edges (it is a dark pan). It was in there for 45 minutes (covered with foil for the last 30 minutes) and when I pulled it out, the bottom 1/3 of the loaf was still a little bit undercooked, while the sides and and bottom touching the pan were already a bit too dark (I know from experience that all this is because of my pan). The actual main part of the loaf looked great though. I tasted a piece of the loaf and it was pretty good! But I put it back in, lowered temp to 325 and will cook for 10-15 more minutes, still foil-covered, so hopefully the bottom will finish. Sorry this is so wordy. I just felt like I had a lot to explain, ha, but this really is a great recipe! I didn't give it a perfect 5 because I thought that wouldn't be fair since I did not follow the recipe exactly. :)

I think this was as good as it would get for being so healthy. I guess i'm just use to oil/butter banana bread. It did seem to have an odd texture. But it was good. Might make it again.

Very good. For a recipe being so easy, you can't beat it.

I used 3 bananas and homemade applesauce. Cut the sugar a bit and reduced cook time for 2 small loaves.

Very good, quick & easy. SO GOOD warm with butter!

Will make again.

I love that this has no butter.  It's very good, though I altered it for my personal preferences. One of the 2.25 c. of flour I used was whole wheat.  I put no spices in it, and I think next time, I may add a little salt.  I got one full loaf and a mini loaf out of the recipe.  My husband likes it a lot so it's a keeper! Thanks.  (I'll try to upload a pic)

Made this up today to use some up some bananas I had that were past the point of being eaten. I've never been a fan of banana bread, and it tastes wonderful to me. I used two smaller loaf pans and shortened the time to 30 minutes. I also added a bit more spice and a slightly less sugar.

I just made this ---
I changed the white flour to whole wheat, and added blueberries as well as the walnuts...Also used equal sugar lite (for baking)...I found I had to add more applesauce (probably cause of the w.w. flour!)
I also made them as muffins...

I was skeptical when I was portioning the muffins out, as the batter didn't taste great--a sure test for me!!
Anyway, as soon as they were done and cooled, I tried one, and they are pretty good!!!!
I did have enough banana taste and they were firm, not pasty as some have described--again, due to the w.w. flour.....
I would make them again, but substituting all whole wheat flour for 1/2 white, 1/2 w.w.
I love blueberries in banana nut muffins---try it sometime---it's a nice surprise....

I'm ambivalent with the rating here.  I liked the fact that when baked, this looked much like a banana bread does when you add butter; you get that nice crusty golden top.  I think the problem is with the amt. of bananas.  I too found that after 45 minutes, it was not done inside and the top was getting very brown(not too brown but if I cooked it for the amt. of time needed to bake the inside, it would be black on the outside).  I turned down the oven temp to 350 and tented the top.  This helped it to bake further and it is very moist; and not gummy   I omitted the raisins, and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it was plenty sweet. doubled the cinnamon, and added a tsp. salt!  Without the salt, this would taste very bland even with a vibrant banana flavor.  Salt gets a bad rap; it helps to ENHANCE flavors. I like the method of the cooking temp and low fat, but will try this again using only 3 bananas to see if that helps cook more evenly.  It actually bakes up like a picture; the loaf really looks beautiful.

This is the easiest banana bread to make.  I added a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, and only 1 1/2 c flour and it was VERY moist.  I did not add nuts or raisins.  I will use this recipe from now on.  I only baked for 45 minutes, too.  Perfect - my husband loved it!!!  Just a great recipe - perfection!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For a recipe with no oil, I was surprisized how moist and tasy it turned out. I added golden raisins and dates for a change. We spread low-fat cream cheese on slices for a tasty breakfast. YUMMY!

The taste is okay, but the inside is pasty and gummy like another reviewer said and not like bread.  It seems like there are maybe too many bananas.

I followed the recipe except instead of a loaf pan I used a 10 cup bundt pan and baked it for about 50 minutes.  It came out very nicely for a recipe with no added butter or oil although I thought it was a little drier than the traditional banana bread recipe using butter.  I did not add the optional raisins or walnuts.  I served it plain with no additional butter spread. My lady friends loved it.

I have been looking for a good banana walnut bread for 6 months! Since I do not eat "sugar" I have been hunting down "sugar-free" recipes, with NO luck! Oh I have found some, but they were not good. This one, well, I liked the ingredients, and decided to try it (did not read ANY  of the reviews, since I truly wanted to make my own decisions), and I used "SPLENDA" instead of sugar. I added a cup of golden raisins and the walnuts..and I waited patiently. It fluffed up to a golden brown, it slipped right out of the pan ( I did shorten the baking time to 40 minutes)...and I am more than thrilled with this recipe!!!!!
Teresa, Thank you for sharing! Your Granny's recipe will live on thru more than just your family, this one is a definite keeper and one I will pass down as "Granny's banana bread" too!!!
