I used this recipe for an entirely different berry, but wanted to share it so that others might adapt for thier own needs. I was making individual pineapple upside-down cakes and wanted a cherry sauce to drizzle over them. I used this recipe, substituting black cherries for the ground cherries. I also allowed it to reduced down to a beautiful thick sauce. The black cherries I used were run through the food processor to a nice small chunked size. It was a beautiful presentation and the spices in this recipe were the perfect compliment to the pineapple and sweetness of the cakes. Wonderful!Thank you for giving me a great start to a wonderful sauce.

this was delicious!  I used half frozen dark sweet cherries and half frozen cranberries (finely chopped in a blender) and then added some chopped fresh raspberries to the finished product. I also used 1/2 cup lemon juice and half a cup of water to make it a little more tangy. The spices are amazing with my version as well and it made the perfect topping for vanilla ice cream... highly recommended!

I used the sauce as a ham glaze. Delicious! The flavor is sweet but piquant and much better than  canned pineapple. Two changes: I crushed the cherries in the saucepan so the pulp would simmer into the other ingredients. I also divided the sauce to use half for basting and half for spooning over the finished meat. Otherwise, no changes. Everybody raved.

I did make changes, used regular cherries - half tart, half sweet dark - next time [and there will be a 'next time' - I might use a little less sugar, but it was delicious!  Thanks!

This recipe is perfect.  Our Cherry tree had a bumper crop this year. Made this, added the lemon juice as one reviewer suggested and put it over Vanilla Bean ice cream on a super hot day here.  Wonderful! Just right, love it.  Next will be using it as a glaze on some steaks on the grill.
