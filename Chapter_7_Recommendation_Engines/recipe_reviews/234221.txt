It was good but I didn't have any gram bears so i used it as undiscovered island red water because I had no blue jello. Would eat again

I made this with my 6 year old niece while on vacation at the beach and she loved it!  I bought clear plastic solo cups and intended to make enough for 6 people. One of the large boxes of Jello only filled 3 cups to the desired 3/4 full, so you may need to buy more Jello than the recipe indicates.
