The chicken was delicious, the gravy was even better.  We made sandwiches out of the leftovers for lunch that were just awesome.  Really easy to make ahead of time and you can do so many different things with it.

All the roasted chicken recipes I've tried in the past have been pretty bland. This is a VERRRRY tasty recipe.  Thanks for sharing it with us!
