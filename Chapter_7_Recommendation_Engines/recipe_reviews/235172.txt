We made these tonight and they were awesome!!! It was so simple and also so very easy & fun to do! What I find so ironic is that my 11 yo who doesn’t like cheese of any kind to such a degree that we have to clarify NO CHEESE! on his burger when we are out to eat & wants his home made pizza made w/o cheese. (Huh?!!!!!) My other kids loved cheese so much that I could get them to eat just about anything if it had cheese in it or on it! My picky eater LOVED it so much that he’s requesting this as his everyday snack at school! It didn’t hurt that we made it together tonight either. It was a fun and a very easy recipe to do with kids. The video helped guide us to make sure we were on track. I’m looking forward to mixing up the recipe w/ different spices and cheeses as Chef John suggest. This is definitely worth giving this recipe a try!!

Really not the best recipe for crackers.  They feel greasy and shrink an incredible amount in the over.  I think the butter is what's wrong with these.  Sifting the cheese into the flour till it becomes cornmealish and using something like olive oil instead would allow these to be thinner and more elastic when rolling out.  And adding baking powder would give the classic store cheese cracker look and texture.  The spice is correct but I would add 1/2 tsp turmeric for color and a little deeper spice level. I will not be making these again.

Made these today and they are delicious but I learned a few things along the way. 1. Make sure your cheese is a warm as the butter, cold cheese is harder to work with than cold butter. 2. Do not re-roll the scraps, makes them tough and chewy, if you're making these for guests just nibble on the uneven ones. 3. Don't bother wasting your time docking them with a skewer five times just poke them twice with the times of a fork, 4. Use your hands to mix the dough, at least for the last few minutes. 5. They're easier to dock if they stay sitting next to each other before putting them on the baking sheet. 6. Do use foil but just spray it with non-stick spray  instead of wiping oil all over it.

Excellent recipe.  We made 400 sheet pans of these in two days and could not keep up with the demand.  Diners were actually asking if they could buy bags to take home!  They raved about them!  What an awesome recipe and easy technique Chef John! Only change was we used smoked paprika for a little smoky taste which you know we try to incorporate in most of our menus.  Thanks again Chef John!  GREAT STUFF.

FLAVORFUL!  Watching the video, prior to making, made this recipe so easy to do.  I used Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar and Kraft Parmesan Cheese, as it was what I had on hand.  It took a little less than half the 8oz. pkg. of cheddar.  The only change I made was to sprinkle with coarse salt before baking. The baking time was perfect and they puffed up nicely.  I was surprised that they did not stick to the baking sheet.  Such a FLAVORFUL cracker!  Thank you Chef John, you've done it again!

Very good recipe, they are addictive! I used my food processor instead of using the fork method a lot faster and more even mixing.

These are DELICIOUS!  I have actually modified the recipe to make doggy crackers as treats for my dogs.  I reduced the amount of cheese and instead of straight water, I mixed a little chicken base/bullion with the water so it was a chicken/cheese flavor.  Also, I baked at a lower temperature so they actually got crispy.  They cooked too quickly and didn't dry out at 375 for me.

I used Tillamook Sharp Cheddar and I can't remember which brand of parmesan I used because I had rewrapped the cheese.  The video made very clear how easy this recipe was to make.  In fact, it was so easy that I think I'll have to make some more tomorrow and cut some of these into little tiny shapes using cookie cutters---like in the shape of fish!  These crackers are kind of like that and Cheez-It crackers except you know what in these (like the Chef says in the video).  You'll have to try these!  Thanks again, Chef!

I loved this recipe ,real cheese taste ,loved the fact that it didn't have a lot of flour in the recipe .I think i may have over cooked mine so check the crackers after 10 mins .I will be adding these to my snack list . Also they taste fantastic with a glass of red wine or 2 at the end of the day .Thanks again .

Chef John's recipes never disappoint!  This was such fun to make, and the addition of some smoked paprika made the smell absolutely irresistible while they were baking.  My husband took them to work yesterday unbeknownst to me, and he had to confess later that his co-workers gobbled up every last one.  Someone commented, "Seriously....who makes homemade crackers?"  Chef John does, y'all...and so can you!

Great flavor, I added red pepper flakes and garlic salt instead of regular salt. My only complaint is that they were a little chewy instead of crunchy... Not sure why.

My whole family enjoyed these. I used extra sharp cheese, which gave them a tang that I didn't really enjoy. A pastry blender made integrating the flour into the cheese mixture much easier!

I don't know what I did wrong, but my crackers did not turn out puffy or orange-looking like Chef John's, despite following the recipe to a "T." They were brownish and did not have much flavor. I used good quality sharp cheddar cheese and grated my own parmesan. I was going to use these on Thanksgiving, but now I'm glad I tried them out before the day. Will not make again. I see the other photos of this recipe don't look like Chef John's photo of them either.

I didnt have butter, cheddar or cayenne. Used instead marjarine, mozarella and chile powder. I had never baked crackers. ever. Tried to be positive throughout. I was pleasantly surprised when they cooled!! I will be baking them again with butter, cheddar and if any cayenne is available at the store.

All I can say is "Woah Momma!!" Delicious!!! Will be making them again. My 3 yr old is super picky with food or snacks, this recipe got his approval! -- Omit the Cayenne pepper, or not, is up to you! Process was simple! First time making crackers and they were a success! We added a bit of garlic powder! Yummy! --- Thank you for the recipe. -- By the way, to those complaining about "greasiness" use parchment paper! And cool the dough before as told if you want to be able to cut them in shape! Just do what the recipe says! - Will recommend to my friends!!

So Delicious! Perfectly Tasty! I made this 3x already and used a combination of parmigiano reggiano, mozzarella and aged cheddar.  Thanks Chef John!

Excellent recipe. I used sharp white cheddar and shaker parmesan from the pasta aisle. I also got impatient and only refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes but it still worked great- not at all sticky. Even cutting corners, the crackers came out puffy and crisp and delicious.

Made these tonight on a whim, and wow. I did two different batches, one following the recipe and one with mozzarella and garlic. The recipe ones tasted almost identical to store bought cheese crackers (Nips or Cheese-its) and the mozzarella ones were like little bread sticks. A big keeper in my recipe box.

Just made these and I couldn't even wait for them to cool to give them a try. I loved them & they tasted just like Cheez-its! I used Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar and Kraft shredded parmesan. The cheddar flavor is definitely strong enough. I also used a little extra cayenne for mild spiciness. It was all easy to do, just time consuming. Here are some things I noted and some tips. I thought the parmesan shreds were too long and stiff so I chopped them into tinier bits before mixing them in. Instead of using a fork to blend in the flour I used a pastry blender (all the wires and the ability to push down into the dough was much less work!) I used Reynolds non-stick foil on a thick cookie sheet and just a light dab of oil smeared with a paper towel. This might help reduce the greasiness some mentioned. I don't think you need the oil if using the non-stick foil, though. I used a sea salt grinder to salt them prior to baking. Knowing my gas oven, I set the temp 5 degrees lower and they baked in about 11-12 minutes. 

My only problem making them was rolling out the dough to a uniform thickness. I would err on the side of thinner so they can get crispier. Even my thicker ones were delicious, though. Don't forget the hole punches. I employed an unused wood stick from an oil diffuser as a toothpick was too thin. These help limit how puffy they get. I would make these again, possibly with other cheeses too!

This are awesome and so easy!  I had some shaved parmesan and shredded cheddar in the fridge so that's what I used - but we're excited to try other flavors!  I used my food processor to speed up the process and doubled the batch and they were still gone in a flash!

Who knew I could make crackers? These were really easy to make, thought it would be more complicated. I used Extra Sharp Cheddar. Very tasty and a great addition to a gift basket.

Unbelievably good !  I am over 50 and have never knew or even heard about making your own crackers...I will never again buy boxed crackers...with this recipe I can make any flavor or shape of crackers I need. My family loved them and my friends are going to scream when they try my next batch. To save time I rolled the dough out and cut them into shapes and put them in the fridge till I was ready to cook them. I think it might have made them a little flakier than rolling them out again after refrigerating the whole lump of dough and having your hands warm up the dough when shaping the individual crackers.

I added my favorite spices, garlic, dill weed, powdered onion and red pepper flakes.   I tried for a "very spicy" cracker so I wouldn't eat them all at once.  Thank you so much, Chef John!  They were even good the next day.

Excellent!  Really rich and cheesy.  I made 2 changes in procedure, not ingredients:  I had hard butter so after adding it to the cheddar I put it in the microwave on half power for  20 seconds.  Made combining them very easy.  Also, I rolled the dough into logs and next day sliced them into rounds.  No rolling out and cutting.  Will make these again and again.

These crackers are easy to make and taste good. From the ingredients, you can tell they're going to be greasy, and they are (especially compared to other crackers I've made) When hot, I put them right on a paper towel covered plate and it got full of grease. They basically taste like toasted cheese. They weren't a big hit with the kids, so I probably won't make them again.

Amazing! They're simply the best. I recommend following the directions in the video, since he shows you what the texture of the dough should be in each stage.

These were amazing. So easy so make, quick and better than the store-bought ones. Next time I will substitute water for hot sauce, to make them spicy! I might try to substitue butter for coconut oil, to see if it could also work!

Tasted just like cheez-its. Not a fan of cheez-its lol.  I suppose I was expecting a better taste.  You are definitely better off getting the branded crackers instead, in my opinion.  Will need to look for a new cracker recipe. :)

I feel like I must have done something wrong since they have not crisped up even after cooling... Maybe I didn't cook them long enough; they looked done though.  They seem to have so much potential.  I wish they came out as good as the video's. 
*does anyone know how to dry them out more, that for sure will work?  Maybe the oven or microwave, but I don't want to mess them up.

Delicious. Chef John's recipes never disappoint. Cheesy and crunchy. After making this John's way, I adapted it with almond flour to make keto crackers. Just as good and I have made it that way several times since.

I just made these. They are incredible. I used all Cabot extra sharp white cheddar as it’s all I had. Made it 60 servings and semi followed it. Used 1 cup of flour, about 4 tbsp of butter. Didn’t refrigerate at all. Made two big half sheet pans of crackers, enough for snacks for the next week or so. So glad I tried these!  I will definitely make these regularly

Easy and delicious. Freeze butter and grate it, and use a tiny bit less flour than suggested. Bake slightly longer than you think, too.

Pretty good recipe.  Per some other reviews I substituted 2 tbsp baking powder for 2 tbsp of flour,  added some basil,  garlic powder,  and turmeric  to the batter and deleted the salt due dietary restrictions. (I did dust the crackers with a little salt before baking. ) the dough was very dry and I ended up adding  4 to 5 tbsp water. I mixed everything in my stand mixer. I will make this again.

These were really tasty.  For a first try, I thought they turned out pretty well.  Next time I make them (it won't be long) I will try to roll them out just a little thinner and/or cook them a bit longer.  They were fairly crisp when they cooled, but after packing them in a tupperware container, they have softened a bit.  Still great flavor though.  I used a bit more cayenne than called for I think, because they pack a punch (and I like it).

I made it without oil, without parmesan, a little more water, and a little less butter. I really liked it. These are way better than commercial brands.

Feel free to experiment with different cheeses. I did gouda and parm. Have done blue cheese. Sharp cheddar. Pepperjack. All are awesome. Couldnt tell you how long they keep because they finish within 24 hours. Great party snack. Careful when shaping if you care about the neatness of the final look but mishappen or not they are yummy.  Quick and easy prep. Almost fail proof.

I love cheese crackers , I doubled it and made some changes in that I use cold butter cubed and used a food processor and pulsed extra sharp white Cheddar and 50 grams grated parm and butter till coarse crumb  . I added 1/2 tea of baking powder and blended with flour and spices , processed till fine  about 20 seconds  then drizzled in cold water till it clumps. remove dough and flatten out into a square and add 1 Tlbs sesame seed evenly and fold over four times and reshaped into disc and chilled 20 min and baked on lightly butter parchment . perfectly delicious .

Perfect! Crisp, cheesy, delicious perfection.  10 minutes was the perfect length  of time but I rolled them pretty thin. Oh, the possibilities. And yes! I did it exactly like the recipe says.

I’ve made these several times now.  Puffy, cheesy, crispy, delicious.  SOOOO much better than store bought. I’ve stuck to the directions exactly...just watched them in the oven between 12-15 minutes so I can take them out at th perfect moment.  So quick & easy.  Yum!

So good. Followed the recipe pretty close using medium cheddar and a little extra cayenne. Mine took 16 minutes on the nose for a perfect cook at high elevation. My only gripe is I should have doubled or tripled the recipe like it suggests at the bottom of the page if you are serving multiple people. I usually use a pasta roller on thick to roll crackers, but this dough is easily workable. I still tried, but was easier just to do by hand with this dough.

I made these a few minutes and they turned out to be awesome. I followed the exact recipe with no adjustments. My kids thoroughly enjoyed these cheese crackers. This recipe is a keeper for life!

Flavor was good - however, they were hard to roll out and therefore, were too thick.  There are better recipes for cheese crackers - try the one using rice krispies.............much better

This was an awesome recipe! I made them for no reason except that I was bored. I have to admit mixing the butter and cheese was pretty hard. It took me like seven minutes to mix it and it still wasn't completely mixed.  I loved the flavor though! It kinda tasted like a mix of a cheese bread and cheese its. My sister hates the cheese bread but loved these crackers! It took a long time to poke all of them with a toothpick but it was over all a great recipe! 

UPDATE: I made these again but this time I doubled the recipe (because last time they were gone by the next day) and I sprinkled a tiny bit of cheese on top! It was great!! It made some of then hollow!

Very tasty!  Small batch, but easy to double, or more.  Prefer more spice so increased cayenne, and salted tops.  Also, a fork makes the holes WAY faster than a bamboo skewer, lol, though with reduced opportunity for creative hole placement.  :)  I'll try some other cracker recipes, but these are a winner!!!

Great crackers. Baked mine on parchment omitting the oil and they are not greasy at all. Also added a T. of sesame seeds.

These crackers are yummy!  They taste just like CheezIt crackers, but even better and way healthier.  I used a Silpat mat to line the cookie sheet (or you could use parchment paper) instead of oiling the pan.  I cooked them until they were a little brown and it gives the cheese an extra toasted flavor.  These are great to have around as a healthy snack. I just keep them in a Mason jar in the fridge and they're ready anytime.

Love this recipe!  I even doubled it and they turned out great. Be sure to use a skewer to pierce the tops.  One batch I just forked and they weren't cooked right through. I found this to be a very forgiving recipe. It works no matter if you add too much or too little of any ingredient.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and they are absolutely delicious. I have used different cheeses. I cheated and bought grated cheese, sharp cheddar and an Italian five cheese mix. I plan to experiment with other cheese. Maybe even some different spices. How can you go wrong with cheese?

Just made these and I love them! I never knew how easy it was to make crackers and using natural ingredients, too! My crackers puffed a bit, not as much as Chef John's, but there was still that nice crunch to them (I wasn't sure if they were done after 15 mins, so I left them in the over for another minute). My oldest son doesn't like the commercial Goldfish crackers, but he ate these like candy! Next time, I'll have to make a double, or even triple, batch! Thanks Chef John for the recipe!!!

I just made Chef John's cheese crackers and did it with a couple martini's in me. I added a little more cayenne and a touch or rosemary. I can't imagine how this recipe doesn't work perfectly for anyone. It is the best. I am going to triple this recipe to take to work tomorrow. Unbelievably good. :-)

I love cheese-its. When I saw this recipe I had to try it. It turned out fantastic! Only addition was a shake of celery salt. Cooking time was spot-on. I re-rolled the scraps twice and had nearly 100% use of the dough. Mixed in a drop of water before re-rolling. Definitely will make these again. Going to try a few alterations as suggested by others. Thanks so much for a top notch snack so easy to make!

I followed this recipe to a T, only doubling it.  I like spicy so I was liberal with the cayenne, but kept in mind the grand kids do not (since I was doing it for them), so kept it at a happy medium and, frankly, I couldn't even taste spicy, just flavor.  The only change I made was that after I rolled and cut them into individual pieces, it occurred to me that I did not double the salt in the recipe AND remembering Cheese Nibs had a bit of salt on the top of the cracker.  Therefore, while in dough form, I lightly sprinkled sea salt over the tops and lightly pressed the salt into the dough.  These came out EXACTLY tasting like the store bought version but so much healthier.  Mine were a bit thick, but it didn't seem to hurt the flavor of the finished product.  The only thing I will do differently next time is try to roll out the dough into a cookie sheet so it is more rectangular all the way around and I get more good looking cracker shapes out of every bit of dough.

Love these crackers, very easy! Sometimes I use hot sauce instead of water, sometimes white pepper instead of cayenne. I love that they’ll all bake together in 12-15 minutes even when I’m all over the place on the thicknesses.

Oh my these are good.  Only thing different I did was put in a little Asiago in place of some cheap old cheddar that I had to use. I thought it might boost the cheese quality a bit.  I can't wait for my husband to get home from work to try them.  They are like Cheese Nips on steroids.

I really liked the flavor of these. However, I am not sure why but my crackers turned out semi-soft and super chewy. I followed the recipe exactly only leaving out the cayenne. I liked that this did not make too much. I got about 45 crackers. I made some squares and some mini animals one. They did puff up quite a bit, but the kids ones I made did hold their shape and print which I liked. I cooked them until suggested, so not sure the issue with the texture.

Love love love these crackers, made the recipe as is and they were gone in a day. Can't wait to try it with different cheeses. I think I will try feta cheese next time.

I used a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a bag of shredded Parmesan cheese.  Used a food processor to make it easier.  But it was hard to cut into square so I kept rolling it out and kept cutting out with a small flower cookie cutter.  They came out wonderful and cheesy.  But next time I will try and shred cheese on my own to see if that tastes better than a bag of shredded cheese from the grocery store. For some reason I think it will.....:-)

These were fun and oh so good.  Will play around with different cheeses and possibly add some herbs.  Used aged parmesan and cheddar.  A bit too much aged cheese for the kids but I liked it.
