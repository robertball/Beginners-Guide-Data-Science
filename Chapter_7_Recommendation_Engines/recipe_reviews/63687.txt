when you marinate the meat...first pierce it with a fork or knife to let the marinade get into the meat...the flavor will get into the meat better....

My husband (and even our 7-year-old) thought this was really good.  I followed recipe except added mushrooms.  This will go in the rotation for sure.  Yummy!

I marinated the steak all day and used fillet not flank, the flavour was quite good, I really liked the onions though,they really added a lot to the dish.

This is the first flank steak recipe I have ever had any luck with. My husband and I both loved it. We will
use it again for an inexpensive but elegant entree!

I used a horseradish mustard and garlic salt instead of dijon and plain salt and I skipped the onions altogether (allergies). I pierced the meat before marinating for 45 minutes (during which, I flipped the meat to evenly marinade). Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter and this was the VERY BEST a flank steak has ever turned out for me. It was fork tender, with intense flavor. You may have to adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of your cut, but I was thrilled with the flavor and tenderness of the marinade.

Following the recipe, this dish just doesn't work for me.  The cook time is WAY off.  5-6 minutes per side for med-rare??!!??  I don't think so!  Our dinner was extreamly overcooked.  Maybe 5-6 minutes total.  

I also wondered why I was using chicken broth rather than beef, which I need more than 1 cup of.  The onions were good but there wasn't enough of them for my tastes.

I marinated the steak for about 5 hours and it probably would have been more flavorful if it wasn't so overcooked.

Overall I would say that this recipe has potential, just watch your cook time, add more onions and use beef broth.  :o)

Fantastic Flavor!  Although next time I will use top sirloin instead.  The quality of flank steak makes this a bit chewy. Definitely a keeper

My husband and I just made this tonight and it was wonderful. Mine turned out slightly salty, so in addition to the fat-free chicken broth, I will use low sodium next time I make this - and I will definitely make it many many more times!

So-So. I marinated overnight and I thought this would be great.  It wasn't.  I won't be making again.

The marinade really complimented the beef.  I enjoyed the onions as well.  I followed the recommended cooking time for medium rare, and the meat came out closer to well done.  I will cook it half as long next time.

This was fantastic!  I marinated the steak for 30 minutes on each side, and then added a little marinade to the pan when I was browning it.  Plus, I added baby portabellas when I added the onions.  The onions and mushrooms took a little longer to cook, but well worth the wait!!

Delicious!  I served it with egg noodles sprinkled with parmesan and pepper.  I put some of the juices from the pan over the noodles as well.  It went so well with the steak, which was very flavorful, but not overwhelming.  Thank you!

I used a 2 lb. London Broil and doubled the marinade ingredients, but the cooking time worked perfectly.  I marinated for 3 hours.  I definitely think the longer you can marinade the meat, the better.  The onions really make a difference.  I used a sweet yellow onion and recommend using the entire thing- it goes great with every bite.

I did like this. My problem is it didn't seem to have as much flavor as some of the other marinades I use. I loved the onions with it and my family will eat it so I gave it 3 stars.

Disappointing. The marinade smelled wonderful, but didn't seem to penetrate into the meat. It ended up in the chicken broth which boiled away.

I didn't use a Flank Steak.  I a different type of steak and I loved it.  I could not find "Flank Steak" at the grocery store.  Awesome dish!

Made this last night and I wasn't disappointed.  Followed the recipe to the T except I broiled the steaks instead doing them in the pan.  The meat was tender and juicy and the taste was excellent.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Good flavor, needed more chicken stock than called for.  Be careful not to overcook!  Will make again.

The flavor was delicious, even after only marinating it for 30 minutes. Very easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly and came out exactly as it stated-medium rare. Thank you for the great recipe!! :]

I cooked this 3 minutes less than the recipe said and it was still overdone. Also there was way too much pepper and the onions took about 8 more minutes to get them to carmelize.

I cooked this for my wife and FIL.  They thought it pretty good.  They don't like onions, so I left them out, and just worked the flank steak.  I left the stock at 1/2 cup, since it was sans onions.  Way easy, I'll be making this again.

The marinade smelled great while cooking, but the flavor didn't reflect that....it wasn't bad, but I had expected more from the smell while cooking.

We were very pleased with the outcome of this recipe. The flavor was great. The only thing that I have a problem with is the sodium , but you can't have everything.
