This was a sure hit!!  I'll be making it many more times.  Be sure to chill it for at least two hours or overnight is even better.  I would leave out the vodka for a church social or school potluck...or maybe just keep it a secret and change the name to olive dip!!

WOW. Really ---  WOW.  I made this for a Ladies Only Xmas party. When we go out for dinner, we always get Dirty Martinis, so I thought this would be appropriate.  It was.   It was a huge hit.  The only minor change that I made was to add some garlic powder.  (Sorry I am a garlic head .. can't resist.) If you like olives and vodka --- you will love this.  I'm planning on taking it to the next party I go to.  Serving in the Martinin glass looks really cute.  Thanks for the recipe !

This would have been good without the vodka.  I put in only half of what the recipe called for and made it the day prior to my party, but it was still very strong.

I was trying to come up with an equal counterpart to Robert Rothschild's jarred Dirty Martini Dip as I haven't been able to find it at my local Hallmark store. I have to agree with the other reviewers--the vodka taste is too strong and it needs more olives. I did used pimento stuffed olives and I added in a quarter cup of chopped jalapenos. Even after sitting, the vodka taste did mellow but it was still way too strong. I'd like to play with this recipe. I think it's close, but it's missing a little somethin'-somethin' or two. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I like it better without the vodka, and use chopped pimento stuffed olives and a few dashes of seasoned salt, use only enough olive juice to make it spreading consistency. Really good on toasted rye cocktail bread.

This is great with pumpernickel stick crackers or pumpernickel melba toast.  I left out the vodka for a family function and we loved it!  It can tend to get salty, so you do have to watch it.  I used pimento-stuffed olives.

I followed the directions exactly, and the spread was way too thin.  I added another 8 oz package of cream cheese and that fixed the consistency problem.  After letting it sit overnight, I found the vodka taste to be too strong the next day.  I might try to make it again with less vodka to see if it's just my taste that's off, but I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would.

Make sure you don't serve this right after making it or the vodka will not be absorbed into the spread.  It has a totally different taste after 2 hours and firms up.  I love olives and dirty martinis so I thought this one would be a winner.  It was ok.  Half of my guests who loved olives thought it was good, but the ones who didn't forget it.  I don't think I would make this again, but it was fun to try and very festive in a martini glass with an olive for a garnish.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Fun presentation!  Great for the holidays using chopped stuffed green olives (festive!).  Taste was OK .. defintiely has a vodka kick.  Heavy olive taste (obviously!) so don't serve it alone if you aren't sure your guest like olives!

My martini loving family enjoyed this at Christmas.  The presentation in the martini glass with olives was also very pretty and completed the recipe.

Thanks for the recipe! Turned out great! Added a little Tabasco, & some minced garlic, & next time may cut the amount of vodka, but overall it was a hit! Very creative!  Cheers! ;-)

Eating this dip was an interesting experience. At first, I wasn't sure I liked it. But the more I ate, the more I wanted to eat. Must have been the vodka!

I LOVE dirty martinis so this sounded right up my alley.  This does taste like one...  It's really missing something, though.  I would definitely increase the olives to start.  After that, I think it still may fall short.

this was way to salty tasting and the vodka added a strange taste. if i were to make this again, which is unlikely, i would omit the vodka.

This was a good recipe for a change &  very easy to make.  Great reviews from guests.  I found this really just served 12-15 people & was not sure what type of crackers would go with this.  I added a SMALL clove of garlic, minced & a dash of green hot sauce. Go easy on the olive juice as I thought it was a bit salty.

This dip was a hit!  There wasn't any left after my party. Next time I will use a food processor to get a smoother consistency, but my guests raved about this dip and asked for the recipe. This will definitely become one of my regular party dishes!

Loved this dip!  Don't even think about making this if you don't like vodka, oh! it is definitely in there and you can taste it.  It really does taste like a dirty martini, garnished with a cream cheese filled olive.  I served with Toll House Herbed Pita chips, yummy.  This would be a great appy to bring to a cocktail party.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was the best and the easiest ever.  I did add a little garlic but all else the same.  They loved the martini glass server!
