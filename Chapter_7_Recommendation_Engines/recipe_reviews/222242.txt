I love this is the summer or for a pot luck.  I do vary it a bit.  I add yellow wax beans and use a red onion and green pepper.

This is almost the same three bean salad my mom used to make except she used wax beans, green beans and kidney beans.  Also she added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire Sauce.  Even as a kid, I loved that bean salad.., I think it was the dressing that made it so good.  Now I make it myself... hmm, must be missing something because it never tastes as good as Mom's.

The celery is a good addition to Three Bean Salad.  Hubby is our Bean Salad expert around here and he said these were too oily for him & needed more sugar and vinegar.

Made & let sit as recommended, but this would've been a 5 if I'd let sit over night.  I had a little leftover & having it the next day was so much better with the flavor mixing. Next time I'll make a day ahead of when I want it.  Also, we don't care for garbanzo beans so used yellow wax beans instead.

We aren't a big fan of sweetness in a bean salad in our house, so I cut the sugar to one tablespoon. I might cut it out altogether next time. It would have been tastier with more salt, but  I know I really shouldn't add more for a healthful recipe, so I'll be checking out other possibilities for seasonings to give it a bit more zip. I did like the addition of celery and find the combination of garbanzo, kidney and green beans to be my preferred combination in a bean salad. I like making my bean salads a day ahead and placing them in a plastic canister with a tight-fitting lid, so it is easy to invert the canister and re-distribute the dressing every time I go in the refrigerator. It makes for a tastier salad without needing to marinate it in excessive amounts of dressing.

Jan. 20, 2014. We all love this recipe in my house! Except I used a smaller amount of onion FINELY chopped. I have also used red onion. I have since mixed & matched up a variety of beans. -Rikita

Thought this was absolutely wonderful. Cut down on the onion though and diced them really really small, no one in my house likes raw onions. Made this recipe for easter and it was a big hit with the baked ham!

I really liked this. Next time I will reduce the oil and increase the vinegar just slightly.  I used green beans, garbanzo. light and dark kidney and cannellini for a large double batch.

I like this recipe because of its simplicity and the result is always good.
I didn't use any canned beans; I steamed fresh green beans because they look and taste better (greener) than canned, and for the others I soaked and cooked dry beans. It's a little more work but I like the end result better.
I followed the recipe for the dressing fairly closely, although I did add some chopped garlic and dry Italian herbs. However, I mixed the dressing ingredients separately in a bowl with a little Dijon mustard to form an emulsion before pouring it over the beans. 
I disagree that it needs more sugar. I have an aversion to sugar in savory foods, so I added none. YMMV.
Note that the olive oil gets greasy when refrigerated so I recommend taking the salad out to warm up about an hour before serving.

I chose this recipe because it had less sugar than others I've seen.  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I used 3 cans of beans; seasoned black eyed peas, chick peas and black beans.  It was excellent!  This is an easy and very versatile recipe.

I loved it. Very important to let it sit overnight in the frig.  It gets great flavor.  I used 1/4 green onions since that was what I had. Difference in texture but it was tasty.

Did not make any changes to the recipe and it turned out great. Let it rest for about 8 hours as someone commented that the longer it sat the better it got. I think with this base you could add about any other veggie of your choice or maybe some sweet peppers if you like them.  Really a great recipe for a novice like me.

Loved it!  Add salt to taste or it may be a little flat .  Celery is important for crunch.  Letting it marinate is crucial.

Great taste and texture. I added a few extra tbsp of vinegar to give it some more zing; the recipe as-is turned about a bit bland (to our tastes).  I love the celery, ill probably add more next time.  Great side dish or snack!

I'm taking it to a picnic where people are carb and protein conscious, so I added a can of black beans. And, I've lived in the South long enough to add some sweet salad cubes, and a chopped boiled egg.

I enjoyed the addition of the celery.  As there are only 3 of us I used a can of mixed beans and add one of green and yellow beans mixed.  Also as others add red pepper and onion.  Thanks Kara
