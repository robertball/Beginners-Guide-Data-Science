Okay, first time I made this I followed other suggestions--I warmed the milk and eggs and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tbsp powdered sugar.  I preheated oven to 425 and put the butter in the pan.  This first one only took 13 minutes to cook and even then it was slightly burning and seemed uneven...but it was still good.  So then I made another one, and this time I didn't warm the milk and eggs, I only added the vanilla and not the powdered sugar.  Also, most IMPORTANTLY, I reduced my oven to 400 and warmed the skillet without the butter.  Once the batter was done, I added the butter, kept the pan in the oven for a minute or so, then took the pan out and added the batter.  It baked for about 18-19 minutes and it was perfectly puffed and golden brown.  It was PERFECT this second time around!!  I submitted a photo for reference...

I became addicted to these after having them at the local Pancake House, and was very excited to find a recipe. After a few false starts, I figured out the trick... for these to turn out correctly, YOU MUST USE WARM EGGS AND MILK! I submerge the eggs in hot water from the tap for about five minutes (refilling several times) and microwave the milk for 50 seconds. Doing these two simple things dramatically changes the end result. I make one or two of these on the weekend to have for lunch during the week... they heat up surprisingly well in the microwave. With fresh squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar there's nothing better!

Yum! I've always heard this called a "Dutch baby" - my sister first introduced me to this at a breakfast restaurant near her home in Vegas. I was so excited to try this recipe!

Thank you so much to SemantiTheft who advised warming your eggs and milk - I did, and it puffed like crazy! I don't have a microwave right now, so I just put a few inches of hot water in the sink and put the eggs and the big measuring cup of milk in there while the oven was preheating. Worked like a charm!I also add a capful of baker's vanilla - clear instead of brown; won't darken the color of the batter - into the milk. Adds a tiny hint of sweetness which I like.

This was so easy, and so much fun to watch while it's in the oven - and really fun to eat, too! I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I just used my regular (oven proof) pan the same size, and it worked just fine! I used margarine instead of butter, and the edges seem to be a little salty, so I think I'll try unsalted butter next time, but completely delicious even so! I debate reducing the butter every time, but I think those little pools in the middle are part of the magic! :)

As is I would give this recipe 4.5 stars. With the few changes that I made it was 5 stars.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla,a few dashes of cinnamon, and just a pinch of sugar.

This was great! While it was cooking I warmed up some strawberries, bananas, & pineapple in a non-stick skillet with a 1 tbl. butter & 1/4 cup brown sugar. Topped the servings of the "pancake" with that and then added some light whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon. The only suggestion I would have would be to use unsalted butter. The salted butter gave it more of a savory taste.

Fantastically easy! Chewy goodness! It definitely helped to have a cast iron skillet, and I just tossed in the butter,  heated it up in the oven for, I dunno, 20 minutes or so, and whisked up the batter and dumped it in. 20 more minutes and it looked even BETTER than the picture. Sorry, I can't take a picture of it now. I ate it.

Yummy! Better than the restaurant that serves this by my house. I had a craving for a German Apple (it's a German Baby with apples), but I didn't want to have to go out. I substitued for what I had in my kitchen: Smart Balance for butter, soy milk for regular milk, and a square, 8.5" pan. I think the soy milk made it fluff up more. It was all fluff actually (no custardy center). The only thing I would change is to use a non-stick pan. I did the traditional lemon, maple, powdered-sugar topping. It was delicious. I submitted some photos. Next time I may add some granny-smith apples sliced thinly to the bottom of the pan to get the German Apple taste. I just didn't want to experiment too much the first time around.

This is great! A memory from my childhood of a restaurant breakfast treat where they called it a "Dutch Baby". My cast iron skillet is only 9" rather than 10" so I ended up having to add about 7 more minutes to the baking time to compensate for the batter being less spread out in the smaller pan. I would have found the eggy-ness VERY unappealing if I'd taken it out at 20 minutes! The edges didn't burn, so it worked out fine. After cooking, I filled the pancake with cooked pork link sausages and sauteed apples with lemon wedges, maple syrup and powdered sugar on the side. It made a quick and different easy dinner. I think the batter could have used a speck of salt to it, but that is my only complaint.

This was very yummy! I added some sugar and a dash of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. There was a diner that used to serve this dish in my hometown. Every time we went I would order this. I was so excited to find a recipe for it. It tastes just like I remember! I ate the whole thing myself, and then had to make another one for my boyfriend!

I've been making this for years, my mother made it when I was a child and my kids make it for their kids.  We always ate it with lots of powdered sugar and lemon juice squeezed over it. The trick to getting it big and puffy is to make sure the skillet (I use a 10" pie pan) with the butter is sizzling hot and pour the batter in right away and put it right back in the oven. The batter should start pulling away from the sides of the pan as soon as it's poured in, that's how hot it needs to be. Don't lower the temperature, cook it at 425 degrees.

Great recipe!  I divided it into muffin tins for little individual servings and baked at 400 for 15 minutes.  Turned out perfect.

We have the very first Original Pancake House here in the Portland, OR area, which is known far and wide (and franchised now) for the best Dutch Babies and a yummy variation Apple Pancake using this batter.  This was just as good, and I am shocked!  :)  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of salt and a dash of nutmeg.  This is now replacing the one I have been using that calls for heavy cream!  One side note - I only have one cast iron skillet, and made two...one in the cast iron and one in my belgique.  The cast iron came out better.  ENJOY!

These are a childhood favorite for me.  My Swedish grandmother taught me to make this dish that we call "Dutch Babies."  We top ours with lemon juice and dust with powdered sugar.  If you divide the recipe into muffin cups, they come out as cute little puffs that are less eggy in the middle and scream, "fill me with fruit!"  Yum!

So easy and tasty!  I baked mine in a glass pie dish and it was excellent (and so much easier to clean than the similar popovers I make in muffin tins).  It's fun to watch it rise so high in the oven, and I really like the tender eggy center.  My kids thought it was delicious with powdered sugar or syrup.

I make this in the fall the day we pick apples.  Come home, peel and slice the apples, cook them with butter, cinnamon & sugar and put that over the "pancake".  Been a family tradition with my girls and now with our grandchildren!!  It makes a wonderful fall dinner!!!

This has quickly become a family weekend favorite!!  I do add vanilla.  Tip, whip eggs before adding milk and whip eggs and milk before adding flour.  It rises better and turns out more spongey.

I loved that this recipe was so easy to make and didn't require a whole lot of ingredients. I didn't have a cast iron skillet that had high sides, so I used my 9" metallic round cake pan. It worked out just as good.  I forgot to add the powdered sugar before I submitted my pic. Otherwise I did that and added vanilla, cinnamon along w/warming the eggs and milk too. Unfortunately, I forgot to cut up lemon wedges. However, the hubby ate it anyway. This is for sure something I will continue to make for us and future guests.

YUM. I warmed up the milk and eggs like others suggested and made the recipe exactly. I served it with leftover pineapple I had in the fridge that I warmed it up with butter, cinnamon and brown sugar and it made a lovely syrup. Thank you!!

I just made this for the kids and I and it is delicious. I increased to 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour, as my skillet is a little bigger. I also used half all purpose white and half wholemeal to make it a little more nutritious. It didn't really collapse after taking it out of the oven. but was absolutely delicious. Would serve about 4 people, I think. I think next time I would add a Tablespoon of sugar to the batter and put the apples on the bottom of the pan to make this even more delicious (if that's even possible). Thanks for sharing. I am German and had never even heard of a German Baby before.
EDIT: I made this again on Sunday. When my daughter heard that I was making another "giant pancake", she got very excited. This time I added 1Tbsp sugar and a pinch of salt to the mix. I sliced and chopped 2 apples and laid them into the bottom of the dish with the butter and a small handful of sultanas. I sprinkled this with another Tablespoon of sugar and some cinnamon and placedd it in the oven while pre-heating for about 10 minutes. Then I poured the batter on top and baked for 20 minutes as per recipe. I served it with a little more cinnamon sugar. This was out of this world.

LOVED IT!  I cut the recipe by 1/3 (2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup flour, 2 Tb butter) and baked in an ovenproof saute pan for 17 minutes at 400 degrees.  It turned out PERFECTLY!  Great presentation and flavor with very little effort.

Since I make this almost once a week for me and my husband, I'd love to give it 5 stars. Since I have add to it so I can't quite. I don't really measure anything I add....1 pinch salt (helps with the rise), a little vanilla, a little sugar, dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon. I've added various fruits and pecans. Everything works well except blueberries. Recommended as a great base recipe. Easier than pancakes :)

Really like it but I still like the one at my pancake house better.  Maybe they add sugar in their batter?

These are so simple to make. I did discover one thing, I over beat the eggs one day when the phone rang. It never rose in the oven and just came out like a thick egg disk. Now I am more careful about how long I beat the eggs.

This recipe was awesome!  I added a cut apple sprinkled with cinnamon sugar to the pan after the butter melted and then added the batter.  This was soooo good.  We are now going to double this recipe and have on Christmas morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this! Easy and a great treat when you add a warmed fruit compote. I topped mine with the powdered sugar and a generous helping of a blueberry sauce I whipped up using frozen blueberries. Topped with whipped cream. The second one I made seemed a little more "eggy" tasting than the first, not sure what happened there. Still yummy!

Wow maybe our best breakfast ever and we never had them before.  I did add 1/4 tsp. of vanilla, 1/4 cinnamon; and 1/2 a tsp. of sugar.  Me and the kids loved them!

I had seen a dutch baby on TV and so wanted to try one. This was the easiest ever and everyone loved it. I've been making them at least once a month for bout 8 months. I make a fruit topping with a bag og frozen mixed berries and 1/2 cup of sugar and about 1/4 cup water and cook down till thickens up. Kids love it over their babies.

I liked this recipe because it only requires three eggs, just enough for my hubby and myself.  I baked it in a cast iron skillet and served it with rhubarb strawberry sauce, as we have rhubarb growing in the garden.  I am glad to have found this recipe.

I have a number of recipes for this "Dutch Baby" but most of them are for a large quantity. I like this version for only 1-2 people. I added some nutmeg, vanilla, & a little splenda. It turned out fantastic.  Reminds me of my mothers Popover recipe.

I followed the other reviews and this recipe turned out fantastic!! I didn't warm up the milk & eggs, but warmed up the dish before melting the butter in it. I also added a bit of vanilla extract, powdered sugar and sprinkled some nutmeg and cinnamon on top before baking at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Golden, fluffy and yummy. LOVE IT!!!

Per Dutch Babies II, I added nutmeg and vanilla and really liked it that way. I warmed the milk + eggs. I'm also one of those who does not like the pools of butter, so I use only 1 Tbsp, or enough to get the pan good and coated.

only reason this wasn't a high review is that the butter ran over the edge and made a mess in the oven, it tasted wonderful. On the second attempt (which is in the oven now) I cut the butter in half and used almond flour, we will see : )

This is delicious.  I tried this out one weekend, and my family loved it (including husband and all 4 kids aged 5 - 11).  I made it the very next weekend again for company that included adults and kids of various ages.  Everybody loved it!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add a dash of vanilla after adding the milk.

When I lived in Portland Oregon I made this recipe quite a few times and it always turned out perfect.  Recently we moved to Arizona, and I have made it twice and both times it didn't rise at all...looked more like flat cornbread.  I'm sure the change in altitude (going from 500 to 3500 feet) has something to do with it.  Does anyone have any tips about making this at a higher altitude?

I warmed up the eggs and milk as suggested in other reviews, and also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I warmed up the pan with butter in the oven while making the batter, dumped the batter in, and it came out perfect in 16 minutes! Served with lemon and powdered sugar. Delicious!

This is a very good recipe base but i have to admit that it is a little bland.  I added vanilla a little sugar and a dash of cinnamon and it was so good.  The timing and the rest of the recipe i followed. Great recipe!

This is a great basic recipe! I made it this morning, and it was quick, easy, and yummy.  The only thing I will try next time is adding a wee bit more flour, as it was rather eggy, and some salt/sugar or maybe even some dried herbs for flavour, as this is pretty bland.  At the same time, it still deserves 5 stars because it works out, and allows for creative changes according to your personal taste.  I will be making this again.

Cast-iron skillet is a must. I added some vanilla extract for flavor...and the oven temperature seems to vary from 400-425 (depending on the oven)

So good, just like the restaurant's version if you add sugar and vanilla and so much cheaper to make!  And it's totally easy.  My husband makes this for me sometimes and his cooking is limited to hamburgers and eggs.

Delicious, just like my Mom made it. The discrepancy between German baby & Dutch baby is that people couldn't pronounce Deutsch, so callet it Dutch, like "Pennsylvania Dutch" which really means or should say "Pennsylvania Deutsch" or Pennsylvania German.

We are officially addicted to this recipe.  Everyone in the family loves this buttery wonder.  You can make it healthier by substituting 1/2 c ww, 1/4 c white flour, and adding flax seed.  We like adding sugar, vanilla and cinnamon for extra yumminess.  The cast iron pan is great for this, and so easy to clean up.  Don't skimp on the butter.  I tried to make it healthier by using less than 1/4 c of butter, and it tasted bland.  The butter in the correct amount will coat the centre of the baby and is essential for proper eating pleasure.

I gave a 4/5 since I added a few ingredients of my own. Vanilla and sugar added while making the batter gives this recipe less of an egg-y taste. I also this off with a dash of brown sugar for an extra sweet flavor. If you couldn't tell, I have a bit of a sweet tooth! All of the other ingredients I used were the same as mentioned. I substituted the cast iron skillet with a small metal pan. The baking time was longer, but it saves you quite a bit of money if you don't already have a cast iron skillet at home. This was actually very easy to make, and to eat! A great dish for any time of the year, and something the whole family can enjoy, if you don't mind sharing!

MMMM!  I used to eat this at a friend's house when I was little.  We called it "baby dutch," but it is the same delicious dish.  I like to squeeze fresh lime or lemon juice over the top before sprinkling the powdered sugar on for a bit of a kick.

I've made better German babies. This one was just so-so. It was lacking flavor. It probably could have used some sugar.

This recipe is a keeper!! I took one of the reviewers suggestion and made sure the milk and eggs were warm which turned out wonderfully! I also added some vanilla extract for some flavor. If you don't have a cast iron skillet you can always use an oven dish which will work just fine. You can also use a whisk if you don't have an electric mixer. Yummy!!!

The kids loved it, we loved it, and it's a nice change from regular pancakes.  Plus, you don't have to stand over the stove flipping cakes all morning, so that's a winner in my book!

I actually use 5 eggs and a cup of flour in a 12 inch skillet, I also turn heat down to 415-420 because bottom gets browned quickly in skillet and I do not want burnt pancake

I grew up with these "Dutch Babies" and there is nothing better!  My aunt and uncle got the recipe from the owners of the Original Pancake House (Portland) and they can't be beat.  Try them with some sauted apples in butter and cinnamon with a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken and it is even more heavenly!  Or go with the original lemon juice and powered sugar, either way you won't be disappointed!

I just made this and loved it.  What a delicious taste.  I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I will certainly make this again but decrease butter by a little bit just to make it a little healthier.  Otherwise this was so yummy.

Although it's good as is, I did add a dab of sugar and a pinch of salt. Then sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg in the mixture as well. This worked perfectly well in a glass 8x11 pan.

My family and I LOVE this recipe.  I added 1/8 C sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the milk.  I heated my eggs and milk and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Served with blueberry compote.  All I can say is YUM!

This looked and smelled GREAT while cooking! I followed the recipe except i added 2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon to my milk and egg mixture. It added flavor. I was affraid it might make it burn a little in the oven, but it didn't. Try this recipe its delicious.

Made this for company, and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly!  Everyone loved it, including my picky kids.  One note I do have though is that the baking temp/time would probably be different for others since I live at altitude (1 mile high).

I used a glass pie pan instead of a cast iron skillet, and it worked great. The fluffy, eggy texture was a big hit with the kids, and it was very easy to make. Will definitely make this one again!

We call this a German Apple Pancake.  You can bake this in a glass pie dish with slanted sides and it will become like a giant mushroom cap.  Be sure you leave space in your oven.  May need to move the oven  racks around. Without the sugar, we Germans also fill this shell with roast beef and gravy.

This reminds me of a giant popover, it was easy to make. I warmed my eggs and milk a bit while my calphalon pan heated in the oven with the butter.  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I enjoyed it with a splash of lemon juice and powdered sugar.  My daughter used maple syrup.  We both loved it.  A nice and easy, and very different breakfast.

This recipe was incredibly easy and the results were great!  I followed the directions except I spaced it and put the cold milk in with the eggs.  It still came out well!  I sprinkled a little coarse sea salt over the top before topping with confectioner's sugar and lemon juice.  Mmmmm.  Definitely a keeper.

Incredible.  Did it in my cast iron skillet, let it cook a little too long, but it's okay, as the crunchy parts soaked up the sauce I made. I melted some butter, sauteed a sliced Pink Lady apple in the butter with a touch of cinnamon and a tablespoon or two of brown sugar.   This recipe is fabulous and easy; it uses ingredients I always have around the kitchen so it's a super go-to for the day we don't make it to the grocery store or lack energy to make dinner an all-out production.  Enthusiastically recommended by an 8 year old, for what that's worth!  I simply don't understand why anyone would go out to order this at the markup that's usually charged when this is so simple and frugal to make.

Simply amazing! It doesn't get easier than this. I did almost everything "wrong" and still got perfect results. I don't have a cast iron skillet. I baked my in a large round ceramic baking dish. I didn't warm the ingredients first. I finished the batter before the oven was ready so it sat for several minutes. It still came out perfect. The presentation is beautiful. It looks like you have been slaving away. My mother absolutely loves the "dutch baby" from the Original Pancake House. This is a total knock off. It was awesome to be able to make this for her over the holidays. She said she liked mine even better than the restaurants. Thanks for the recipe!

I adore this recipe!  I usually use only 3 tablespoons of butter, but otherwise, I follow the recipe as written.  I've also found that for my family, it's closer to 4 servings than 2, as stated.  It has a wonderful fluffy, buttery texture and flavor, and is fun to watch puff up in the oven.  We serve it with powdered sugar and warm syrup.

My husband is practically addicted to these. The only downfall is they're definitely not health food. :) I cook this in a 9x13 for best results and serve with maple syrup.

This was delicious!! I was craving German pancakes since I ate them at a restaurant and these were great! I did change two things. I added a pinch of salt and blended everything in a blender. I figured it was less dishes to clean and it worked well. My pancakes were the perfect texture and flavor! Will definitely make again!

I was looking through some recipes for something a little different to surprise my wife. Wow did I find it! I thought it was like a combination waffle, souffle, funnel cake, and a pancake. My only problem was that I had an eight inch and a fourteen inch cast iron pan. I used the eight inch pan. I had to keep adding to the cooking time and the edges were a little too crispy. To tell you the truth the thing was down right ugly when completed. We really didn't care, one taste and the aesthetics were out the window. One of the best recipes I have made in recent memory, and I have been cooking for forty years. Next time I'm going to try to scale the recipe for the fourteen inch pan and see what happens. I did add a half tsp of vanilla.

Ohhhhhhhhhh soooooooooooo goooooooooooooood... Tasted kinda like a funnel cake with the powdered sugar on top.  I used Pam spray instead of butter to cut back on fat, and I added vanilla and a smidge of salt.  Next time I may try a little cinnamon... And by next time, I mean tomorrow!  I can't wait!

Very yummy. Buttery and soft. I added a tiny bit of vanilla, and we ate it with cranberry reduction, strawberry jam, and powdered sugar, depending on each person's taste. It was still very tasty alone, though!

This was perfect- nice, crusty and buttery on top, and smooth and custardy inside.  I used a 9-inch pie pan, and a little whole-wheat pastry flour.  My husband and I really enjoyed it this Sunday morning!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Growing up, we called this dish "Puffed Pancakes," and the recipe was slightly different...thinner and a little crisp on the bottom rather than custard-like with this recipe.  Also, as a child we would put a lot of fruit on the pancake.  We would cut up bananas, buy fresh blueberries, strawberries, cut up pineapple, and any other fruits that sounded good.  We would also use sour cream, brown sugar, coconut, and any other items like that.  They ended up being a big meal on top of one piece of the Puffed Pancake!  I submitted a picture of how we made them today.

I had never had a German Baby before, I made this for my family and when I tell you everyone loved this even my 3year old. I did add a few things like I put 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract,2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, about 1/4 cup of sugar and then I put my maple syrup while still hot I didn't put the powder sugar because I felt like it was already sweet with me putting the sugar in the batter, because of the maple syrup on top but next time I will add some peaches or strawberries. Oh so good kind of tasted like a big French Toast whitout all the work I will make this again and again and a again that how good this was .....Thanks to you a lot for posting this recipes I give this 100 stars.

This is a lighter and fluffier version than similar "6 egg" recipes--our family liked this one better so we're switching.  However, this is easier when mixed in a blender, and cooked in a 9X13 pan (just drop butter in pan, place in oven, pull out and swirl to coat, then add blended mixture) for the 20 minutes.

This was FANTASTIC!
I have to admit that after readingthe reviews I did add the vanilla and a bit of powdered sugar to the batter. I melted the butter in a heavy duty nonstick cake pan and then added the batter and out into a hot oven. Rose beautifully! I liked it with lemon and powdered sugar and also homemade hot maple syrup. My husband liked it with just the syrup. Thanks!

Well, I guess this turned out like it was supposed to.  I served it w/ sweetened strawberries, lemon, and maple syrup and we weren't too impressed.  I won't make this again.  The recipe turned out like it was supposed to I think.  I made it because I thought it looked neat and tasty, but since I have never had it before, it's hard to rate based on any comparison.

This is an AWESOME recipe.  Its perfect  with lemon and powdered sugar.  I didn't have a cast iron skillet, I just used a 9" square cake pan and it turned out great.  Very good.

Love this recipe! I use a strainer to sprinkle the powdered sugar over the top after baking it. It gives it a finishing touch and looks elegant. I also like to sprinkle a few raspberries on before baking. And for baking, I turn on oven, place the pan in oven. Mix batter. Put butter in hot pan. Leave until mostly melted. Dump in batter and throw on a few raspberries then bake! I have made it many many times. This is my go-to breakfast to make when guests are over and they all have loved it. It’s sooo good!

This had a very custard type taste to it. My family often has breakfast for dinner (brinner), and this was a nice change from pancakes and French toast. It was very good and we will definitely be having it again.

Seriously amazing! My husband loves a Dutch baby and every recipe I have made was too eggy in flavor. This was perfect in flavor, light and fluffy. I used room temp eggs and warm milk. I also added a tsp of vanilla extract.

It's an easy yummy recipe, we used to eat it every sunday in Germany. Germans don't use lemon juice as a topping, they use cinnamon sugar. I prefer mine with baked apples and cinnamon sugar on top. In the winter season I let the apple soak in Amaretto for a couple of hours, than top it with whip cream. It so delicious it melts in your mouth.

Pretty good! 3 stars for original recipe. Next time I made it I'd say it was 4 stars: I used a 12 inch skillet so I used 4 eggs, 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Same amount of butter and powdered sugar. It was still a little bland--but still good. I think I'd add more cinnamon next time, and maybe some brown sugar.

This was fantastic! I made it for the first time this morning - it turned out perfectly. I can't believe the impressive results for such an easy recipe. I warmed the eggs under hot water and microwaved the milk as suggested in another review. I baked for 20 minutes at 425 - perfect. My kids thought it was too eggy - were expecting something more like a pancake I think - I wasn't bothered at all by it. Will make again... and again... and again... can't wait to try with fruit on top or apples on bottom of the pan like I read in another review. Thanks so much!

Maybe 3 1/2 stars. I'm not sure what I think of this. It was SO easy to make, but mine didn't rise and fall like it was supposed to. This was bland tasting, so I guess what makes it good is what you put on it. I put powdered sugar and syrup on mine and it was pretty tasty. I liked the chewy / crispy texture. My son who doesn't like eggs was not fooled by all the syrup I poured on his. He wouldn't eat more than a couple of bites. I might make this again just because it's so fast and easy.

When my wife and I ate this, we kept thinking "This is really missing something." I liked the density of the cake, the taste was just lacking.

I didn't realize until after I had this in the oven that the recipe didn't call for any salt.  Maybe if you put in the full amount of butter and it was salted it would be ok, but mine came out flavorless and frankly, gross.  Sorry, but I won't make this again.

Try serving hot, a little butter, pour a little lemon juice, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Or, fry some apples in butter until starts to caramelize, add some cinnamon and sugar to taste. So good on a cold morning!

soy milk also works perfectly too. I always add vanilla and sometimes 1 tb of sugar.  We prefer to use 2 pie tins and not a 13x9 or 9x9 because we love the buttery,crusty edges.  This is really yummy with traditional lemon, syrup and pow. sugar, or is really good with honey butter.

Yummo!!  Quite possibly my new favorite breakfast...lunch...and dinner!?  So good with powder sugar, but also sweet with maple syrup.  My kids couldn't get enough.

Never made a german pancake until now and I must say it is a great breakfast for just 2 or a large group.  I have made it twice and both times it came out great.  I did add vanilla and we squeezed fresh lemon on and oh does it make it taste way better..  Don't forget to heat up the maple syrup for and added touch.  Loved it and will definitely be a keeper for the recipe box.  The 2nd time I made it I had to bake in 2 round cake pans.  I melted the butter first then quickly heated the pans and then baked.  This worked out fine but did stick a little b/c I might not have split butter equally or could have been my pans.  I also take the pancake out of my pan and cut up like a pie for easy serving.

I made this for the first time this morning.  We're trying to "lighten up" our meals so I cut the butter to 1 tablespoon, used 2 whole eggs + one egg white, and added low-fat lactose-free milk.  I also added just a pinch of salt and a splash (maybe 1/4 teaspoon) of vanilla.  I heated the oven to 425 but reduced the heat to 400 after 5 minutes of baking.  Baked for 20 minutes and it was picture perfect and delicious!  I served ours with freshly stewed apples - YUM!  Thanks - we'll definitely have this one again!

I had never heard of these before, but found them on the recipe of the day a while back.  These were so good!  I've made them a few times and they are great every time.  The boyfriend loves them as well!

Yummy!  Followed the ingredients exactly.  I didn't have a cast iron skillet so I melted the butter in the bottom of a cake pan.  Still wonderful!

Yum!!!  Where have these been all my life?  I loved the variation in each bite.  Some bites were buttery, some sweet, some salty, some fluffy, some crunchy.  I added 1 t vanilla, 1 t powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I am looking forward to eating these again!

Notes on this recipe: This is my exact same family recipe and so I know it is great. But I thought I should add that in our family it is called a Dutch Baby and it is a little different than German Pancakes. German pancakes are served with lemon wedges but we eat Dutch Babies differently. We serve this topped with fresh berries (blue, raspberry, blackberry etc.) sour cream (not whipped cream)and topped with powdered sugar. If you eat it served this way you will be delighted!

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I used to order this at least once a month from a pancake house that has closed, and my sister-inlaw & I tried your recipe & our husbands said it was better than the one at the pancake house. We did not alter anything. We all prefer to have it with a glaze made of whipped butter,juice of a fresh lemon, & powered sugar. This is perfect....Wish I could give you 10 stars.

Okay, I have never had a German Baby.  This was pretty much tasteless, but would have been good with some sort of meat or a sauce.  Edible, but I would rather have regular old pancakes.

Wonderful!  Just like the Dutch Babies at one of my favorite restaurants.  I ended up cutting the recipe to 1/3, since I wasn't too hungry, and I whipped it up in my blender.  Took me all of 30 minutes from "I could try this," to calling people to tell them how good it is.  It came out beautifully.   I garnished it with powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice.  So easy and so elegant.  Perfection.

Perfect, exactly the way they should be.  Using the skillet in the oven gave them a nice crispy outside, and they still kept that wonderful crepey inside.  A hit with the whole family and an easy, quick breakfast.

Very yummy! I used to have this recipe, and lost it, so glad I found this. I added a dash of Almond extract for a little extra flavor. After baking, i top with freshly squeezed lemon juice, and a little powdered sugar......YUM, YUM!!

I agree this was an excellent recipe.  I cooked it in my grilling skillet, used soy milk and a bit of vanilla extract.  It didn't puff up evenly, but I attribute that to my subpar oven.  It was very tasty with orange and lemon juice.

I've never tried anything like this before, but the ingredients were what I always keep on hand so I thought I would give them a try and am really glad that I did. These were delicious! They taste like a cross between an omelet and a regular pancake. So easy to make and even without anything on them, they tasted fantastic. This is definetely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Tasty!
I also followed suggested warming of milk (50seconds in microwave), and adding of vanilla (1tsp).
Kept oven at 425, pulled it at 16minutes. 
My photo is the one with the honey in the background.

Nice option for a breakfast treat, it was SO tasty!  I used my dutch oven rather than a pan, it looked amazing when it came out of the oven, only thing I'd say is I'd cut back a bit on the butter.  Wonderful easy recipe!

This turned out very good.
It was something a little different and was extremely easy to make.
I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, as others suggested.
I will make this again.

My husband and I love making this recipe. Some tips: 
If you use a cast iron skillet then it puffs up a lot better. 
make sure the butter has melted and is evenly spread out over the bottom of the skillet before you poor in the batter. 
I haven't had a problem with it puffing up when I've used my skillet, I did use a glass pie pan once and instead of all of it puffing up it turned into a volcano shape. Still delicious, but I think a key thing is making sure your pan is hot before you put the batter in. That is why the cast iron works so well. 
This recipe is delicious and easy to remember! It perfectly feeds my husband and I and if we are hungry enough there are no leftovers! If there are leftovers it's usually a fight to the death to determine who gets to eat it the next day! Just kidding my husband and I usually just share it as a treat with lots of syrup and fruits!

I have been eating/making these since I was a kid. It was the first recipe that I ever remembered because the measurements were so simple to remember as well as the nickname it was called "Lazy Man Pancake": 3 lg eggs, 1/2 C each of flour, milk and butter (less butter if you like, but I use it in the batter and as a drizzle) and 1 Tblsp sugar and I use whatever extract or flavoring I like and I use either fresh or frozen fruit if the mood hits me. Bake it at 375 degrees for about 15 - 20 minutes in a Pam sprayed pie plate or whatever baking vessel I choose and they have always puffed up as pretty as you please and slid right out of the pan - even cast iron. Always a generous shaking of confectioners sugar and that drizzle of melted butter. The sugar in the batter can be adjusted to taste as well as the extract because some people have said that this tastes "eggy" and I thought the same thing when I first tried it as a kid, but now I have an arsenal of flavors that could make anyone's taste buds dance! So do the same and play with the recipe! There are endless possibilities for this basic baby recipe and it's a good one!

Really good- will make again. I didn’t have a 10 inch pan, mine was a bit larger so I doubled the recipe. I think I will go buy a 10 inch and try it again. I believe it’s supposed to be a bit thinner than mine turned out and that’s probably on account of my pan and doubling the amount. Still, it was really good and we all really enjoyed it.

this is a great recipe! turns out perfect every time. I decrease butter to 2 Tbsp, but that's just my preference to save calories. it still has great flavor and melted butter can be added afterwards if you need more.

Good with the T of sugar and 1/2 T of van. It didn't curl right because the pan was a little too cool when I added the batter. Recipe is a keeper!

I made it for my family and they love it. My little brother made it and he is only 9! He rarely cooks and they came out great. They are super easy and super good, with maple syrup and jam or anything you would have on a pancake.

I followed recipe exactly. My husband and I, who neither one have ever tried a German baby, both thought it was ok, and different. Has a very eggy taste. Spongy texture in the center, where its thicker. My husband said it might have been better with sausage and eggs inside. But I will probably never make again.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe, so if you like this sort of thing, it's a great recipe.

Followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly. This is amazing with lemon juice over the top, that's how it's served at the Original Pancake House. If you think it tastes bland with just powdered sugar and syrup, squeeze a fresh lemon over it after it comes out of the oven. It transforms the taste!

Double the recipe. No one will eat just 2 servings! I had to use Almond milk because we just ran out of regular milk.. It ended up taking a lot longer to bake and the consistency was more 'oat-like,' but really good!

I let my butter burn while I was searching for my hand mixer. Mine did not rise much. I think due to the simplicity that it is worth trying again. I love the fact that you can put so many different toppings on this treat.

I followed the recipe as it, but added sliced bananas to the pan while heating.  It came out very tasty.  Next time, I think I'll add a touch of cinnamon and vanilla for a little more flavor.

This was an awesome recipe!!! Followed the other suggestions, 400 degrees, let the pan warm before adding the butter.  MIne was done in 15 minutes.  My family said it was keeper and that we need to make it more often.  I did warm strawberries,blueberries and bananas with some cinnamon, brown sugar and a squeeze of lemon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make my dutch babies in pyrex dishes, the larger individual ones. So much easier to serve each one their own. Melt the butter just like the iron skillet.  400 degrees for 30 minutes.  They really puff up and guests can see the in the glass in the oven, fun.  Served best with warm frozen berries.
This way you can increase the proportions for more.  I use Almond Milk and soy and find no difference.  I even used Almond Flour last time since we are all gluten free in my family.  It was very tasty, a little less light.  Added flax meal also to make the whole thing more nutritious, well, all raved!!!

Very good.  I wish my skillet were bigger because it seemed thicker than what I have had in restaurants.  Still, it was delicious and TOTALLY filling (served 2).  YUM.

I followed the recipe but mine did not rise at all. I must of did something wrong. Plus I lowered the temp as nicksprincess suggested and it still overcooked.  The edge was really brown and hard the taste was really rubbery.

The first time I made this, I tried it in a 12" cast iron skillet I had put on my wedding registry. Not a good idea unless you are going to increase the amount of batter you use.  That extra 2" adds nearly 50% more surface area to the pan, and the batter needs the edge of the pan in order to rise.  After a little research, I found out that an old cast iron skillet is far better than anything you can find in a retail store, so my husband picked up a very lightly rusted 10" Griswold at an "antique fair" for $12 and I just finished restoring it.  I didn't read the reviews, so I didn't change a thing about the batter, the only thing I did change was to use only approximately half of the butter.  It turned out perfectly puffed and golden-brown.  I took it out of the oven at 18 minutes because I was afraid it would get too well done, but that could just be my oven.  I served it with some left-over lemon filling from my lemon tea cookies (don't think that recipe is on this site...) and it was amazing!  Next time I'll try adding a bit of vanilla extract.

This was fantastic!  I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I just added some vanilla extract and a bit of white sugar.  I topped it with maple syrup, and mmmm so delicious!  My boyfriend really enjoyed this recipe!
