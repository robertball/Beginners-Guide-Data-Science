The cookies were absolutely delicious and lived up to my excitement for fudge crinkles, crackles, chewies, by any name my favorite cookie! 
I had to tweak the proportions as well, and the cookies took no more than 6 minutes. 
Due to my limited tins and pans, I found out that this combination of ingredients - in any preferred measurements - is an indulgence as well as an invincible go-to for any event.
It can make an amazing pie crust on the bottom or, if you line the pie tin with wax paper and grease+powdered sugar the paper, you can flip it onto the top of a pie or cheesecake!
or for cookie cake (if you add a bit of baking soda and almost double the chocolate chips, it's SO crackly outside and fudgy inside)!
I can't imagine this recipe with anything less than Ghirardelli 60% dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips- it's worth the extra dollar over Hershey. 
I am so excited to add this to my catering platters!

Good, needed more flour.  I used 1 3/4 cups instead of 3/4 cups.  Lots of chocolate!

Great recipe, fairly easy. The reason why so many people have trouble with the batter is the melted chocolate. If you let it cool like the recipe says, the batter is very workable. Even so, I did add an extra cup of flour and they were perfect. They are almost gone and I made them yesterday!

Well this was a disaster. 1 3/4 cups of flour was too much, and I think maybe the chocolate was too hot when I added it to the egg mixture. I ended up with hard little ice-cream scoop-shaped lumps. Crunchy outside and soft inside as advertised though. I may make a second attempt, but not really worth the investment in chocolate. Flatenning them with a fork was not an improvement.....rubbery crumbles resulted.

Wonderful cookie. I didnt change a thing other than melting the chocolate in the microwave and a few more nuts.  I wouldnt add any extra flour to these.. .. if you do they will still taste great but the texture and the extreme fudgy-ness will change. I did have to bake mine a bit longer.. I think about 11 minutes
