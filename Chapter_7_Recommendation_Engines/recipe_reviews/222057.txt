It was good, but nothing special. Liked the spiciness and the lime. Needed something else, though, and I'm not quite sure what. Some vinegar? A little sweet? For a southwest salad/side dish, I like Mexican Bean Salad from this site a lot better.

Really loved this salad the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is I thought it could use a little more kick.  I added a few tablespoons of salsa (Hot and spicy) and that really spiced it up and enhanced the flavor.  It is also a great diet food tasty and low cal.

Great recipe!  I made it exactly as is but used more fajita seasoning to spice it up even more.  Turned out fantastic and everyone loved it.  I used 8 ears of fresh corn and turned the heat up to medium high because medium just wasn't getting it done well.  Will definitely keep and make again!

I thought it was very good but I only gave it 4 stars because It just tastes like it is missing something.

I didn't have any red bell pepper on hand. Without the bell pepper, it only gets 3 stars. I am pretty sure the bell pepper would have made it 4 stars, so I am rating it accordingly.

Used shoepeg corn because I had a can open and it was still good. I will try fresh that I've grilled next time.
