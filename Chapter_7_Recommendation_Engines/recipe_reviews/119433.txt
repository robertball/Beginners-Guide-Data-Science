This is really delicious!!! It gets better the next day.  By accident I put 2 tablespoons of chili powder...and I also put a heaping Tablespoon of cumin. I also added some smoky Spanish paprika which really tasted yummy and I threw in a cube of Knorrs Chicken with Tomato bullion. I used three small cans of chicken broth and a whole bag of dried lentils. This is so good.  I serve it over brown rice.

I thought this was great, especially since it was sooo healthy. I sautee'd the onions first, to carmelize them a little, and since my grocery store had only canned lentils I used that (it saved time and tasted great)I also added brown rice. I served it with fat free sour cream and corn bread. It was unlike anything I've eaten- a refreshing change.

Made this in my rice cooker..I used 1 cup lentils & 1 cup yellow split peas and left out the meat and it was great it yielded 9 big cups worth..I froze 7 for quick lunches.Thanks for a quick recipe as I always have these ingredients on hand which makes this the best recipe yet for lunches.

This chile was just okay the night I made it. But the following day, it was perfect. The only change I made was I used 1 cup of lentils instead of 2. I suggest making this recipe a day ahead because it was really delicious the next day.

Since a bag of lentils is 2 1/2 cups, I scaled this up to 10 servings. Also, I cooked it longer than 25 minutes. Closer to an hour I think. Very good! We'll find various ways to eat this for several days!

Loved it!!  Only changes I made were, I used one 8 oz can of regular tomato sauce and one 8 oz can of spicy mexican tomato sauce.  Also, cooked it on very low for almost one hour in order to be tender enough.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro.  Will make it again.

Takes about an hour to cook. I used 2 onions (instead of 1) and added 1 can of black beans and kidney beans each. Chili should have beans I think. Good flavor but could use a little more if you want.

I honestly preferred this to regular bean chili.  Something about the smaller lentils... Loved this one because it was cheap to make and really healthy.  Froze several portions and reheated for lunch and it held up great.

Nice for a quick meal.  I used canned lentils (rinsed and drained) and a large (~26 oz) can of pasta sauce for the tomatoes specified in the recipe.

Delicious!! I sauteed onion, garlic, celery, carrots, red peppers and zucchini in some olive oil, removed from the pot and browned the ground turkey. Added the veggies back to the pot and the remaining ingredients. I used canned lentils...cuts the cooking time considerably. I also added a can of green chilies to spice it up. Sooo...good!!

This is good!  I tweaked it a little. 30oz of chicken broth. This made it super thick like a chilli. I also didn't put any meat in it. I cooked in a crock pot on high for a couple hours then on low. Also, it needs way more seasoning. I put in about 5tbs chilli powder, 3tbs cumin, and then some hot sauce. It tastes great!!! My husband (who will only it one specific chilli from the store) liked this a lot too! I will make it again, next time I'll add in the meat.

Was not a fan. It was pretty bland and was more like a soup than a chili. Definitely not hearty if that's what you expect from a chili.  Could be good if beans were added and a lot more spices.  Cheese and sour cream help too...

LOVE THIS RECIPE!

This is my second time making it (at my husband's request).  Super easy and even freezes well.  

I always bump up the spice a bit.

Fantastic chili!  I added a few extra veggies (corn, green pepper, red pepper), but other than that didn't muck with the recipe at all.  Will definitely have again, tonight in fact!

I wanted to like it because I love chili and lentils are so healthy for you, but it was a little bland.  Maybe next time I'll add even more spices.

Excellent chili! I made this with ground chicken, because thats what I had in the freezer. I used 3 cups of lentils instead and I added a bag of frozen broccoli. Everything else was followed the same. I served this with some nice crusty bread and some brown rice for the rest of the family. I bet this will make delicious leftovers for tomorrow!

I did things a little differently, but like to review the recipe anyway, since it gave me the good ideas. I used about 1/2 lb turkey, and added some chopped red bell pepper, diced garlic, and chopped carrot as well. I also added a few more seasonings (curry, onion powder, garlic powder, and extra cumin and chili). I cooked the veggies in a little butter, and then cooked the turkey with and added the seasonings. I put the turkey/veggie mixture into my crock pot along with the lentils, broth, and tomatoes. I let it cook on high for about an hour, then left it on low for 4-5 hours. I served with a dollop of sour cream on top, and toasted pita bread on the side. This was sooooo good and super healthy. And a bonus being that I adapted it for the slow cooker, so it was piping hot and ready to go when we got home late from work one night. The addition of the curry gave it an indian type taste which we loved. Thanks so much for a recipe that gave me all kinds of ideas.

Wonderful! I hate lentils. But I started this no Carb diet and frankly I was getting sick of just meat...so I decided to try Lentils as a protien. Anyways I made this dish the first time but I added two jalepenos, onions, six cloves of garlic, tomatos diced, and a can of tomato sauce. I had to cook it for an hour until the lentils were done. It came out Great! Try this recipe as a building block to start out from. You really can not go wrong with this recipe.

We liked this tasty variation on traditional chili.  Super healthy, too!  I sauteed the onions in a little olive oil before adding them to the chili and also substituted chicken boullion cubes and appropriate amounts of water since I was out of broth.

I have been trying to integrate lentils into my cooking and this did the trick. Sautéed onions first, added portobello mushrooms, and increased the spices a little in addition to adding smoked paprika. Did not have an issues with the volume of sauce as other reviewers mentioned. I am thrilled to find such a healthy meal that freezes beautifully...although it might be eaten before it truly freezes!

This is incredibly easy and very tasty.  I didn't have a Dutch oven, so just cooked the chili a bit longer in a conventional stock pot with lid.  I also sauteed the onions as another reviewer did.  Instead of 6 cups chicken bouillon, I added 2 of chicken and 4 of beef.  I think it's about 1 cup too much liquid, though.  I like my chili a bit thicker...so I simmered it without the lid for a while to evaporate some of the excess.  I also added red pepper flakes and more powdered beef bouillon to tast.  Yum!

We love this recipe! It's great exactly the way it is, but we like ours a little spicier. I add 4 large jalepeno (seeded and chopped), 2 tbsp. minced garlic and 1 tbsp. of cayenne pepper

I was pleasantly suprised at this chili. I made it just as it says and it turned out very tasty. Even hubby liked it.  Nice to have something healthy and delicious for lunch. Next time I think I'll add garlic and maybe green chili. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a recipe calling for lentils as I wanted to try them and this recipe fit the bill. Very easy recipe and the flavor is good. I put it in the crock pot to simmer all day, adding the lentils during the last 30 minutes. Will make this again.

Next time, I wouldn't use as much chicken broth, as it was too much liquid.  I used half tbs of chili powder and half tbs of paprika.  I also added 1 cup of rice, to absorb the liquid.  The taste was still very good, and I would make again with adjustments.

This was a nice, flavorful chili.  Surprising, since it had so few ingredients.  I liked it, but the rest of the family wasn't fond of it, I think just because they prefer traditional chili.

This was super easy to make, and I like that it is so filling yet so healthy. However, I didn't love this recipe. I found the combination of turkey chili and lentil soup (two foods I love separately) to be pretty strange-tasting. Not bad, just not something I'll make again.

This is a fantastic & healthy dish, I added in all no-salt & low sodium products and it was still really tasty. I'll definitely add in some zucchini  next time - great idea!

This was pretty bland I gotta say.  I love lentils so I was excited to make this.  I even added some extra seasoning at the end.  I should of tasted it while it was cooking.  I will give it credit for being a very hearty meal that makes alot and very cost effiecent.  But I don't think I would make it again.  Maybe if I had everything on hand.  I would add some garlic, maybe instead of the diced tomatoes add a can of Rotel or just a can of green chilis.  I would also next time add some carrots and celery.

I was looking for a way to incorporate more lentils into my diet and found this recipe.  It is so good.  I froze the rest, and it reheated very well.

Precooked the onions in pan, and added some crushed garlic to that. Used a can of lentils.
Everyone in the family agreed it was delicious! Served over rice, and it was devoured!

I love almost anything with any type of bean or lentils - super yummy and very hearty!  I used both brown and red lentils as I had both on hand, added in chipotle chili powder along with the regular chili powder and only used about 2/3 pound of ground turkey as I used the rest to make tacos for my son!  I also simmered mine for closer to an hour - excellent!

I cannot attest to the claim that the leftovers are even better the next day, because there won't be any leftovers :) Yowza, this is yummy! This would be good with or without meat, I had one large chicken breast I needed to do something with so I cooked that, chopped it up, and put it in. It was delicious!

This is healthy, simple, and absolutely delicious. I've added it to our regular dinner rotation. Even my husband loves it, and it's rare for him to be so enthusiastic about a "healthy" recipe! Very hearty and satisfying. Excellent for colder weather, and refrigerates/reheats well. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was very plain and not really like chili at all. I think with some tweaking this could be a good recipe, it just wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping even after upping the spices. It is a healthy, cheap, and hearty dish so I accomplished what it was meant to do.

With this recipe, I was able to combine two healthy items and make a chili that not only pleased everyone (4yr old and teen), but my husband ate seconds - and leftovers!  My previous attempts to use lentils have not been met with much enthusiasm & recently my butcher husband has been bringing home ground chicken to help lean our diet some. I did use an entire bag of lentils & added a can of Rotel Chili Fixin's (already seasoned tomatoes,onions & peppers) in place of the tomato sauce. I also added the spices as directed since we like our chili deep and rich. We will be making this again for sure!

Pretty good! I added a lot more cumin, more chili powder, and a large can of red beans as well. It cooked for almost an hour, which I expected. My husband thought it was a little bland when it was ready, so we ended up adding some extra garlic powder and onion powder and a good deal more pepper. This made a TON though, which is great. We have leftovers for another night this week, as well as half of the whole batch in the freezer!

This was really, really delicious and very easy to put together.  I followed a couple of suggestions and sauteed the onions with a couple of cloves of crushed garlic before browning the turkey, and used 2 teaspoons of chili powder, a heaping teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of hot, smoked Spanish paprika.  This made it just spicy enough for us.  I also added an extra 8oz can of tomato sauce toward the end to keep the flavor strong.  Great idea for a hearty, cool-weather meal!

Made a few changes...I didn't have everything on hand so I improvised and it was yummy!  1 1/2 c Small dried red beans, 1/4 c dried kidney beans, 28 oz chicken broth, 28 oz beef broth, 14 oz of vegetable broth, diced tomatoes w/green chilies, sauté onions, add all other ingredients (minus turkey) from recipe.  I simmered it on the stove for about 3 hours and then added the lentils and cooked it for another 45 minutes.

This is DELICIOUS!  I made a few adjustments.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, so used all diced tomatoes (30 oz), could've used more.  I also cut up carrots in it and that was very yummy.  I also added beans.  This is a very hearty chili and I love being able to use lentils.

Great way to use lentils. I used ground beef and beef broth instead of the turkey and chicken broth because it's what we had. It turned out great. Husband loved it. Good man-meal!

This recipe was great - I only had 1/2 pound of ground turkey and it worked fine too. I added a tbs of paste beef stock base and it added a nice dimension.

I used ground turkey breast which I liked because it's much healthier for you than the standard beef chili, but I was expecting to be blown away after reading the reviews.  Maybe scaling back on the lentils would allow the chili flavor to come through more.  It made a big pot and I froze some for a cold day.  I don't think I will be craving this anytime soon.

This is a great recipe. I used French lentils, which give it a smokier taste. I also used fire roasted tomatoes, for additional flavor, added garlic powder, and sauteed the onion first. My husband ate it for both lunch and breakfast the next day, he loved it so much!

This was really good & super easy to make.  I like my chili a little bit spicier, and I had to add a little salt (to taste) at the end.  I served this with shredded cheddar cheese & sour cream.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I was so thrilled to actually have all of the ingredients for this recipe in my kitchen!  The only thing I didn't have was the can of chickn broth, which I supstituted for 6 cups of water and 2 vegetable boullion cubes.  It turned out great!

this is a really tasty chili.  I found that it is easily adaptable to make a vegetarian version, subbing vegetable stock in place of the chicken, and using Beef-less ground soy crumbles in place of the ground turkey.  I agree with previous posters, it gets better the next day and beyond.  if you are concerned about it being too soupy, just add a little extra lentils or back off the liquids.  It is a very versatile recipe, I recommend it!

wonderful, healthy addition to my recipe rotation. Healthiest comfort food I've ever eaten. I always make the recipe the way it's shown first, and it I have to say this one is just wonderful if you follow the recipe. You could easily modify it to fit your tastes though. I might add a little salt to the pot next time. But that's just as easy to do after you've dished it up too.

This was flipping awesome!! I had ground turkey AND a bag of lentils so ta-da!! I added some smoked paprika about 1 tbs, a splash of worstchest. sce, a tiny drop or two of liquid smoke. For the tomatoes I just added one big can of diced and a squeeze of tomato paste. I threw in some chopped fresh green beans and a little finely chopped carrot. MMMMM, and a meal you can feel good about eating. Even the kids loved it. Thanks for the great idea :)

I, of course, made a few changes to the original recipe.  I don't eat meat, so omitted the turkey.  I also added "Chili ready" diced tomotoes and didn't have tomoato sauce, so used tomato paste and added a little extra water to thin it.  Also, added extra spices to make it a little spicer.  The end result was fantastic!  Very filling and tasty--Will be a keeper.

This is very good. I used sausage instead of turkey and topped it off with sour cream and some green onion. Quick and easy meal.

This recipe is more like lentil stew rather than chili. If it was called lentil stew it would've gotten 4 stars.  Chili it is not.

This was actually really good. Everyone loved it.  For the diced tomatoes I used some with a little jalapena pepper in it and it was great.

I was looking for a recipe for which I had all the ingredients in my cabinet and found this little gem. These are the changes I made: used ground beef and beef broth, used 2 T chili powder and 1/2 T cumin, added 1/8 tsp. red pepper, 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 tsp. oregano and omitted the onion (picky eaters). The dish didn't take very long and tasted great. This was a wonderful dish to make when I didn't want to go to the grocery store. I'll probably make this again, but it is more likely that I will stick with regular chili.

There is nothing horrible about this.  It is just slightly bland and not as good as I expected based on its high rating and rave reviews.

I've never cooked anything with lentils before.  So I was pleasantly suprised how delicious this turned out. 

Very low fat (5pts per serving) and freezes great!

Will make again and again.

The only alteration I made was using "italian style" ground turkey.

This recipe was very tasty.  I made it like the directions said although did not have quite enough chicken broth so added what I had.  It was probably thicker than it should have been but very hearty and tasty.  My husband loved it too.  Will definitly make again.

This is a great base recipe. I made a few alterations for my family...and it came out delicious. I added twice the meat...1/2 the lentils...i can of corn.. 1tbls each, chives, celery seed, and oregano. I also added three shots of hot sauce. Even though I made a few changes, this recipe is a great guideline.

I have never cooked with lentils before, we had a lot of turkey and needed to us it up.  We used chunks of turkey meat instead of ground. This tasted very similiar to your standard chili even though there were no beans and no beef. It was good. 

Very middle of the road as far as chili goes, though. Use the turkey and lentils, but spice up as you would real chili.

Was a bit unsure how this would all go together. It was fantastic. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked onion first with a bit of garlic. Addes a tab bit more chili powder. Will be a staple from now on!

Really good! Wasn't sure what it would taste like, but even my husband liked it, and he doesn't like any of the ingredients.    I cooked the onions with the turkey, next time I may add some garlic and maybe more pepper, needed just a little more spice.

Easy to prepare and tasty, too!  I like it even better with a tsp of dried red chili flake.
