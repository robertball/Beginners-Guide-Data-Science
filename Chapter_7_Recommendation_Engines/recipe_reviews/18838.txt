Just wonderful! An ordinary barbecue sauce suddenly became our family's favorite sauce. I used a bottle of honey barbebue sauce and added only two tablespoons of soy sauce. Oh, I also used chicken thighs instead of turkey. Can't wait to try again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe wasn't bad, but wasn't remarkable either.  Probably won't keep this in my recipe file.

What about winter? I made it on the oven and it was superb!
