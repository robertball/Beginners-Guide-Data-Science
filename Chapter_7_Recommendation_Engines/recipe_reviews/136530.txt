I submitted this recipe, and I would suggest using TWO SPLASHES of each mixer: rose's, freh lime, cranberry, and grapefruit, NOT fluid ounces!

I had this made for me by a bartender with peach snapps instead of peach vodka and it was delicious!

It was nice...a little too sweet for me and the triple sec overpowered everything.  If I made it again, I would definitely decrease the triple sec--maybe use add'l fresh squeezed lime juice. Use freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice--it really ramps up the 'fresh' flavor!
