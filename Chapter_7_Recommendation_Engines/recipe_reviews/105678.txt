I'm giving five stars b/c the finished product tasted great.  However, I had a problem with it sticking really bad to the skillet.  I couldn't just let it sit for the 10-12 minutes or it would have burned badly, even after I reduced the heat.  I also had to stir after adding the eggs so it came out as sort of scramble, but the taste was awesome!  I will make this again!

This is an excellent dish and can be done in a frying pan on the stove in the same way.

I have made this dish many times over the years.  Its a warm, hearty, one pan start to a day outdoors.  I use canned potatoes for easy preparation.  Another trick is to precook the bacon, if you want the convenience of less refrigeration, smaller space consumption.  You do need some of the fat for cooking the potatoes so dont make it too crisp.  Happy trails.

Not camping but we enjoyed this at home just the same. I used my cast iron skillet over a gas range to cook this. I doubled the bacon, cut the potatoes back a bit and added fresh minced garlic, red bell pepper and mushrooms. I just cooked the potatoes to a nice crispness, then added the onion, garlic, red bell pepper and mushrooms. This was a nice hearty and filling breakfast that fed the four of us (yes, four.......not eight). My husband and I garnished ours with homemade salsa, hot sauce and sour cream.

Loved this recipe. My family and I loved it. I like being able to prepare something that everyone loves in one dish.
I did not use a castiron skillet, but a large non stick skillet instead and it turned out great even cooked on the stove.
I did pre cook the potatoes in the microwave to speed things along and also pre cut the bacon before cooking to save time.
Will make again

You can dice the potatoes (store in no-leak container with cold water) and fry & crumble the bacon at home first.

Very basic and very tasty breakfast.  Next time, I will cook the bacon ahead of time to cut down on prep time.

This was very good.  We used breakfast sausage instead of bacon.  My picky kids ate it right up!  My husband loved it as well.  I made in in a skillet on the stove, but we will definately make it camping this summer!

This is something like what I grew up eating in the summers at our family's campground lot.  I followed directions but made a few modifications based on time and what my preference is, otherwise, followed everything else.  Here's what I did differently: 
I made recipe stovetop at home over medium heat in skillet.  I chopped bacon into bite size pieces before cooking to save time. I added a little olive oil to pan since I used turkey bacon, which doesn't generate enough fat for cooking.  I left skins on potatoes which is a personal preference. I added garlic powder and pepper to potatoes (didnt add salt because most bacons are salty enough for my taste but wished I had added a little--all personal preferences).  Last, I added about 1/2 cup milk to my eggs before adding (it makes eggs fluffier, again personal preference.)  Not major changes, just personal preference changes.  I don't believe my changes impacted the flavor of original recipe.  From start to finish took about 30 minutes before we sat down to eat. 
This is a user friendly recipe that is very versitale.  You can modify it to make it your own very easily.  You can add heat if you like it spicier. You can also add other veggies like green pepper or mushrooms, or even make with sausage instead of bacon, as we've done that before too.  If you like the core ingredients, you really should give this recipe a try--even if you are not camping.**Thank you for sharing recipe**

Easy and delicious! I did this on the stovetop and added in some chopped broccoli that I needed to use before it went south. I also added some garlic powder and black pepper in with the eggs. I LOVE that it was a one skillet meal, making for easy clean up.

Very good.  Did this in a pan on the stove.  I used frozen cubed hash browns w/onions and cooked in the bacon grease.  Very easy to make.

This was ok. Needs salt and pepper. If I make it again, I will partially cook the potatoes before I put them in the skillet; hopefully they won't stick as much that way.

I made this on the stove. Loved the fact that it only used one pan. As written, it was pretty good, but not fantastic. I would suggest adding some garlic and maybe some other spices to add some more flavour.

This was my idea of camp cooking...much easier than cooking everything by itself.  We worried about the amount of bacon grease so we removed about half of it...mistake...we needed it all since we cooked it over the campfire.  We will definately be making this again.

A classic.  I can't think of a more perfect combination of ingredients, especially if you add peppers (bell and/or hot).  The proportion of ingredients is not all that important in this mix, almost anything will work.  Not just for breakfast and not just for camping.  Made it this morning in my cast iron skillet on the stove.  Happy tummy!

Great recipe.  I really did cook this over a fire and it was delicious.  I ommited the onions and guestimated the cheese.  This will be a camping staple!

I grew up on this meal and we often had it for a quick dinner.  I also use it as an adult and my own family loves it anytime of the day.  We sometimes use different breakfast meats for a quick change up.

A great camping dish - we plan this so that when we bake potatos for dinner, we make a few extra - and then throw the cooked, chopped up potatos in the pan after the bacon. They brown up nicely in the bacon fat, and dont take so long as they are already cooked. Wipe out some of the fat before adding the eggs - maybe add a little butter so the eggs dont stick. Bacon fat tends to be real greasy - Awesome treat. Gave it 4 stars cuz surely it cant be very good for us...but tastes good!

I love this recipe, but make it over the stove.  It is my "go-to" breakfast when I'm in charge Sunday mornings and need to use up some left over potatoes.  Quick, easy, tasty!

We love this recipe.  We made one similiar to it when I was a kid camping with my family.  We used to call it "Paul Bunyan Breakfast".  I did leave out the onions, but otherwise left everything the same.

We also use Potatoes O'Brien instead of the potatoes/onions.  We also add a can of green chilies and then put it on a tortilla for a breakfast burrito.  Definately an easy camping breakfast.  Smells awesome, too!

I added 1 lb ground sausage and a bell pepper and onion.  Cooked in my iron skillet on my burner on outdoor grill.  Makes it 288 calories but worth every on.  My family all loved it.  Will definitely do again.  Low flame & stir often - or tends to stick.

The first time I made this, my husband and kids fell in love with this dish!! The second time around, I made some changes, but it was still so delicious! Today, I made it again and this time made it without bacon and eggs, and turned out so GREAT! This dish is just great OVERALL! I always make this when we get bored with our usual rice or pasta sides.

It turned out great! My kids loved it.  I followed the recipe almost as is except, I had bell peppers so I added them along with the onions about 4 minutes before adding the eggs. To make it pretty and add a bit more flavor I threw some chopped chives on top.

Recipe works great on the stove too! We used diced ham (didn’t have bacon) so we had to use some coconut oil for frying the potatoes, and we cooked our potatoes a little longer because we like them softer. Delicious!

Skillet breakfasts are a must when camping! This is simple, yet delicious. Who doesn't love bacon and potatoes? For appearances only, I cooked my eggs separate before tossing them into the skillet with the bacon and potatoes because I didn't want it to look like slop for my food pic! Ha!  I know, I know....yes, I'm one of those campers who have to do their hair every morning as well. ;)

Tastes very good.  Careful not to overcook the potatoes, or it can come out too mushy.

Made it on a recent hunting trip and it was a HUGE hit.  Served it on tortillas.  The guys said they look forward to it again on our next trip.

I make this all the time with either ham or bacon. green peppers are a great addition sautéed with the onion.

I am a Venture Scout advisor and this is a hit with the crew. We have made it with canned, cubed potatoes as well.  It cuts down on the cooking time since they are precooked. We also add some orange, red or yellow peppers. We have not had any issues with sticking to the dutch oven or cast iron skillet. My gang gave it a 5 star rating!!

This is a frittata.  If you approach it that way, you can add all sorts of leftovers in your fridge and it will always turn out well.  I went Mexican and added chopped jalapenos and finished it off with cilantro and salsa.  Next time I might try chopped spinach and sliced mushrooms.  Play around with this recipe and make it your own.
