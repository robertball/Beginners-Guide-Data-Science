I am the recipe submitter and wanted to clarify the directions.  Allrecipes omitted a step when they edited my recipe and they suggested I clarify by leaving a comment here.  Make sure to COVER the pot when you simmer the quinoa, otherwise the liquid will evaporate too quickly.  Keep an eye on the pot because milk does have a tendency to boil over. After 20 minutes, there should still be some liquid left in the pot, so you have an oatmeal consistency. You do not want to cook all the liquid out of the quinoa. Feel free to sub any milk you'd like - almond, coconut, cashew, soy, etc! This also makes 2 HUGE portions or 3-4 average portions. Thank you and enjoy! :)

This is THE BEST recipe EVER! My son is GF,egg-free, milk-free, and I am forever looking for nutritious breakfast for him. I did make alterations due to restrictions: almond milk for milk, sugar for maple syrup, and skipped the flax seeds. If you make it my way, it tastes JUST like Froot Loops. Major bonus for a 10 year old boy! He's eating it for breakfast and lunch and snack...need I say more?
Oh, to address comment about bitter taste: yes, rinse it well. And then toast it in pan with butter for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, before adding water. (It totally changes flavor of quinoa. Without, all I taste is corn husks - bleh.)

This was really good! It was fresh yet rich- tasting, and the sweetness from the blueberries and syrup was perfect! Topped with toasted, slivered almonds instead of flax seed. A great new way to have quinoa!

Excellent! This was my first time trying quinoa for breakfast. It sounded interesting and I had all the ingredients. What a fabulous meal! I will make this over and over again and try different fruits too. My kids were a little skeptical, but they ended up asking for more.

Excellent and great change for a healthy breakfast. I cooked my quinoa with 1.5 cups of milk because I wanted to drizzle the finished dish with fat-free half and half. Very adaptable to using other fruits, sweeteners and spices too. I made the full recipe for just me and refrigerated the leftovers and preferred the dish chilled instead of warm. Good recipe Lilsnoo!

I thought this was awesome. I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used blackberries and chia seed instead of blueberries and flax seed. Bueno. Also, I used almond milk instead of regular, and that worked great. :)

Close to being really good, but the Quinoa was just too bitter...I did try to rinse the quinoa, but that turned out to be the most challenging part of the whole recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Since it was a spur of the moment decision to make it I had to make due with what I had on hand.  Orange zest instead of lemon, chia seeds instead of flax, unsweetened almond milk.  I've been leery of trying quinoa for breakfast but my sister introduced me to it over the holidays. Her brand was half oatmeal, half quinoa.  I actually liked the 100% quinoa better!  I will definitely be making this again over the cold winter months and won't be afraid to experiment with different fruits and flavors.

I made the recipie as listed. To me it tasted little plain so I added just a couple tablespoons of brown sugar made it taste great. :) Probably just personal taste here, but much better a little sweeter in my opinion.

This was good. I'm not a person who eats sugar really so the maple syrup (high glycemic index -body turns it into sugar) was too much. I'll probably just do protein powder on top next time instead. Added pecans, chia seed and some raisins yum! Will also try toasting quinoa in butter 2tb of butter beforehand too.

I LOVED this! Was looking for something to make ahead for breakfast this week. Had to leave the lemon out due to diet restrictions but I didn't miss it. Made a compote out of the blueberries instead of just stirring them in but I will try that next time. Put a little pumpkin pie spice in the quinoa as it was cooking. Used coconut milk and agave and a little extra flax. Thank you so much for this recipe Lilsnoo.

Eating this now and it's very good. I followed the recipe almost to a T with the exception of using frozen blueberries. I'll definitely be making this again- probably at least once a week. It's a great vegan breakfast. I'm going to explore cooking the quinoa in water and only adding coconut milk at the end as coconut milk (at least the organic, bpa-free kind) is pretty expensive.

LilSnoo, you just made my morning! I LOVE quinoa and will try pretty much any recipe I can get my hands on. This is an instant favorite in this house! I had to simmer the quinoa for about 5 minutes longer then the receipe states, but other than that, everything was perfect. Home run! Can't wait to try with different kinds of fruit and syrup. Thank you for sharing! I'd submit a photo, because it looked great as well, but it disappeared pretty quickly...

Loved this!  To reduce calories, I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water.   I used chia seeds instead of flax, as this was what I had on hand.  Caution:  don't use too small of a pot, as it will boil over all over your stove like it did for me!

This was delicious. The bitter taste of the zest and the sweet berries just danced along smoothly with the nutty quinoa. But that is just the beginning. The nutritional content is unbeatable. Perfect for those days where you need a vitamin fix.  I used almond milk as stated in the submitter's review and kept the lid on the pot while it cooked, stirring occasionally and it cooked up perfectly. I don't even like maple syrup and I liked this. It travels well and makes a tasty lunch! Thank you for the recipe.

I make "back yard bowls" all the time. There's a place in Santa Barbara called that, and they specialize in all kinds of creations! I definitely toast my quinoa in butter and cinnamon before adding half milk half water. Then half way thru I add steel cut oats, quic cooking. The toppings are endless! Any fruit imaginable, nuts, trail mix, peanut butter and jelly. They used cashew milk on top and I can't find some anywhere. Great recipe!

I added a little less than a 1/4 C of honey and more berries and about 1/4 C of coconut and it's really good, still without being overly sweet.

I found this to be a nice change for breakfast. I toasted the Quinoa first(personal preference) It took a little longer to cook then stated, but it could be because I used lactose free milk. All in all a very good breakfast dish. Thank you LilSnoo for the recipe. Will make again.

This recipe is delicious!! I read some of the reviews and did some minor changes. I used vanilla almond milk and did half raspberries half blueberries. I also tried toasting the quinoa after I rinsed it. No bitterness at all. thanks for this awesome breakfast addition!

Simple but amazing.  Will be a definite addition to our breakfast routine.  We're vegan so substituted unsweetened almond milk.  Blueberries are naturally sweet so only used 1 1/2 Tbsp of maple syrup and it was plenty sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

A friend of mine gave me a bunch of quinoa so I've been using it for different things. I finally made this recipe and I am so pleased with it! Absolutely delicious! I didn't change anything, although j didn't have flax seed so I just left that out. I will definitely be make and eating lots of this!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is wonderful--a great healthy start to my day.  I switch up fruits each time I make it.  My favorite is apples & cinnamon.  I also switch up the milk depending on what I have at the time, usually it's 2% or half and half. Thanks, LilSnoo for a wonderful real-food breakfast!

I loved this recipe! I used almond milk instead of regular milk and didn't add flax seed as I had none. I also was without lemons so I used lemon juice and added a little orange zest. This recipe made for a great breakfast! Thanks!

This was pretty good! I think it would be better with pre-rinsed quinoa. I can never fully get rid of the bitter taste of the quinoa I bought un-rinsed. But this is definitely worth trying, especially if you are trying to healthify your diet. Oh, and I didn't add the lemon zest and it was just fine.

I made the recipe as written, using full fat coconut milk. Yum!  Next time I’ll throw in some cinnamon to make the blueberry flavor pop even more. Definitely makes 3-4 servings.

This recipe is delicious! My only problem is every time I cook quinoa the liquid tried to boil over, not sure if it’s my stove or the quinoa itself. I have to cover it then take off the lid every few minutes to stir so the liquid goes back down. Besides all that I love the combination of the lemon zest, blueberries, and syrup! I topped with roasted flax seeds so it has a nutty flavor. So good!

This recipe is a great alternative to oat meal. I prepared quinoa as directed and instead of maple syrup and blue berries topped it with trail mix containing dried fruit, nuts and seeds, super yum..

This is delicious! I substituted some apple cider vinegar for the lemon zest, but added dried mulberries and hemp seeds instead of flax (because that's what I had). It's light and filling all at once and I'm truly enjoying a healthy new recipe

Awesome!!  Tasted amazing!  Instead of fresh zested lemon I used 1/2 tsp of lemon peel in a jar (that's all I had).  Turned out great.  I would recommend cooking it a little longer than 20 minutes at such a low heat.  Also, my girlfriend doesn't like Quinoa, but she loved this recipe.

I had quinoa already made, so just added almond milk to it.  I reduced the maple a bit to limit the sugar content.  I loved the lemon flavor.  Will definitely make this again :)

Used zest of a whole lemon, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, pure maple syrup, added 2 packets of Splenda and very good flavor.   3 servings 10 pt each, could consider using sugar free syrup for around 7 each.   I do wish it was thicker but that’s just the nature of quinoa

This is my first time cooking and eating quinoa.  This was a good recipe.  I did change some things.  I cleaned the grains for 15 minutes in a strainer.  Then I toasted the grains with 2 teaspoons of butter for 15 minutes.  I used almond milk to cook the dish and added about 4 teaspoons of organic sugar and chia seeds.   To top it off I used cinnamon and french vanilla creamer.  Delicious!!!!!

I am very careful to make the recipe as presented. I then review the comments and then make changes that  seem to make sense.  I admit that I did follow one suggestion and decreased the maple syrup by one tablespoon.  It was still plenty sweet for me, but after reading the many comments, I cannot understand the enthusiasm for this strange concoction.  I have half of it left over and will eat it tomorrow, but frankly am not optimistic.  Unless some magical transformation occurs overnight I won't be making this again

I used dried blueberries, added some raisins and substituted honey for maple syrup as it is not available. I forgot about the lemon zest. I added chia seeds and walnuts before serving. It was really good!

I love this recipe!  Honey is a good alternative to maple syrup if you have it on hand.

Great recipe. Used coconut milk instead. Also skipped the maple syrup due to diet restrictions. Added shredded coconut and blackberries and raspberries. Turned out awesome.

This was a nice bright morning start. I need to limit my carb intake, so I halved the recipe, and ate half, saving the other half for the next day's breakfast. I was a little short on quinoa, but I stirred in 1 1/2 TB ground flaxseed toward th end of cooking, and it thickened to a nice texture. I squeezed in a little fresh lime because I didn't have lemon, and it was just right.

This was much better than I thought it would be and was pleasantly surprised. Portions are very big and could be changed to 3 - 4 servings as posted in the comments. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe as it is a good starter and allows one to be a bit creative with different ingredients.

Loved this recipe, will definitely make again.  A little sweet for my taste so next time will use a bit less maple syrup.  We did not have flax seeds so I topped with pumpkin seeds,  YUM!  The recipe made a generous amount so will enjoy some tomorrow morning.

This is the first time that I made quinoa for breakfast. I like it. It keeps your tummy full for a long time. I cooked it in Soymilk and I added vanilla extract. It's really good. Next time I want to try it with dried cranberries.

Eat this almost daily for breakfast! I use vanilla almond milk so don't add the maple syrup. Lately have been adding sliced fresh strawberries on top.  Yum!

This was really good! I made it with almond milk, and substituted the maple syrup with brown sugar. I had frozen blueberries and raspberries so I used those, and added some cinnamon. Will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

My first time eating quinoa, and it won't be my last. I have to admit that I was a little afraid to try it, but this was REALLY good! The only change I made was to use almond milk. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough for me (I like sweet), but it was perfect. Thanks LilSnoo!

The initial creaminess and texture of the quinoa, the sweetness of the maple followed by the bite of the lemon zest, then finished with the little bursts of blueberry goodness were everything we were wanting out of this dish. I will definitely be adding this to my arsenal!

This was amazing!  I was tempted to add a little lemon juice when I added the lemon zest, because I didn't taste very lemony initially, but I restrained myself and followed the recipe exactly, and I'm so glad I did!  Once it cooled a bit, and the flavors had a chance to blend, it was the perfect mixture of sweet and tart.  Really really good, and a new favorite breakfast!  I made it with almond milk, which worked well.

Was looking for something different to bring to work for breakfast & since I love quinoa, thought I'd give this try.  Glad I did! I made it true to the recipe with a couple minor  exceptions. I had no flax in the house so I skipped that. Increased the amount of lemon zest, only had frozen blueberries  & added about 1/4 cup of shredded coconut. Really enjoyed this!

Very tasty and hearty.  I used the red quinoa, unsweetened coconut milk, zest of a lime and chia seeds in place of the listed recipe ingredients because it was what I had on hand.  I also cooked the quinoa longer than indicated in the recipe and directions on the box, but that's just because I like it a bit less chewy.  I will definitely make this again.

So good! I've got a super fast metabolism, so I'm generally having to eat at least a little something every few hours or so. This dish for my breakfast kept me full from 7am till a little after noon, which is so so helpful for when I'm working! Such an amazing flavor, and so sweet from the maple syrup. Making it again now for breakfast tomorrow!

Had the flavor of blueberry cheesecake. Was plenty sweet without any added sweeteners. I am not a big fan of quinoa, but made like this, I loved it.
