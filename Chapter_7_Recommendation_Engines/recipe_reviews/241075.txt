I love kale and thought this looked like a very simple recipe to prepare for a weeknight side dish.   It was very easy to get together and used simple ingredients which I liked.  I did let mine cook a little longer because we like ours a little more wilted.   I was not as fond of the soy sauce as balsamic vinegar that I typically drizzle on my kale, but, it was overall a very tasty dish.

Tasty way to eat your kale! I sauteed onion with the garlic which added additional taste.  I served with grilled chicken and brown rice made with vegetable boullion instead of plain water. Delicious!

Tasty way to get your greens! I cooked it in the same pan as some sausage had been cooked so it added  a bit of that flavor.

I love kale and am always looking for new ways to prepare it. This is simple and packed with flavor.  I made it exactly as written and found it to be seasoned perfectly.  I will definitely be experimenting with different additions and seasonings.
