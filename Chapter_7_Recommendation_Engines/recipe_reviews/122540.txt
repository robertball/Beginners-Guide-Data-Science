Very good. Like a moist sugar cookie. Instead of just dropping the cookies I liked them better when I rolled them into a ball and kind of pressed them down a bit. Easy recipe too! Will make again and again.

Delicious cookies!  I chilled the dough to make it easier to handle, then rolled it into small balls and flattened with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.

My husband, the cookie master, really liked these cookies. He even makes them himself now. (If you knew my husband, you would know how good these must be!).

These are excellent with tea or coffee. I agree that chilling the dough, rolling it into a ball and lightly flattening makes these better.

This was a super easy recipe for sugar cookies! Not so sure y they're called tea cakes, but they are delicious.  The batch makes about 5 or 6 DOZEN cookies, so add about 30 minutes to prep time!!   I put royal icing on them and that was great too.  Fantastic cookies, thank you!!!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  Absolutely delicious!  This made 74 small tea cakes for me.  I followed other reveiwers advice, and rolled about 1 tsp. of dough into a ball, then flattened it a little before baking.  Also, chilling the dough is recomended.  They made the cutest little cookies.

Excellent flavor!  Not too sweet, and very enjoyable with a cold glass of milk.  I followed the recipe very closely, but with minor changes: added about 1/4 cup of water to the entire batch of dough (as suggested by another reviewer) to make the cookies come out flatter.  I think that may have lightened the flavor a bit, but this is exactly how I like it!  I also noticed that the cookies on the bottom rack tasted better than those on the top rack, because they had more of a crisp on their edges.  I do suggest baking the cookies for a little longer (additional 2 minutes), if you try it with added water.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I'm a Southern girl and had a taste for tea cakes and took to the web in search of good recipe.  My first attempt of a different recipe years ago yielded hard tea cakes, so needless to say I was a bit nervous to try it again.  I stumbled across this recipe and saw the rave reviews and decided to give it a shot and these turned out AMAZING!  I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg and a cap and a half of lemon extract and it was like I was back in my grandma's kitchen!  Made a batch on Sunday and was requested to make a second batch by Tuesday (which I did)!  I like mine thick (like the cover photo) so they bake a little longer (13 mins).  These tea cakes are wonderfully soft and moist and they stay that way days later!  I will definitely keep this recipe in my cookie arsenal!

These were really nice. They went well with ginger tea, and I think I'll have a couple with my coffee in the morning. They are mild and pleasant little, soft cookies. Thanks!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!  I used to make these when I was in highschool.  When I moved out, I lost the recipe, and have never been able to find "the right one" since!  THIS is definitely it!!!  However, when I made them before, I didn't bother with creaming the sugar, butter and eggs.  Just threw it all in a mixing bowl and mixed it up!  Thanks again!!  I love them!

I like the buttery taste but I prefer less of a cookie texture so I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  I also add 1 tablespoon of ground ginger to give em a little kick.

these went so fast, both kids & adults loved them. I made a batch then put the remaining dough in the fridge.  A few days later, I was cooking bacon in the oven on a foil lined cookie sheet... put foil in fridge so the grease would harden faster, (i was just going to throw the foil/grease away. I saw the tea cake dough in fridge, & since i don't like to waste things, I scraped off most bacon grease from foil & baked my tea cakes on it... wow! a hint of bacon flavor on the crispy edges.. gave it a unique tastey taste. yum!  Oh and the cookies baked much better when the dough is cold.

The best homemade sugar cookie I've ever had/made! The only thing I changed was the amount of white sugar. I used 1 1/4 Cup white sugar and 1/4 Cup brown sugar. Thanks so much for this yummy cookie!!!

I am from the south, and this is one of my childhood cookies.  So I decided to make them for our cookie swap at work.  This is a plain cookie and it stood out among the other cookies.  They were fantastic!

Very nice recipe.  I added additional flour, rolled dough out then cut into circles.  They came out they way I remember them when my grandmother used to make them(a little crunchy and not cake like).  Was able to impress my mother in law with these cookies because they brought back a familiar taste that she havent been able to find with other tea cakes in a very long time.

I used a smidge less vanilla extract and used a smidge of almond extract.  Topped a few with coconut.  Delish!  Great recipe!

Great recipe! Made it exactly as written.  Formed tsp sized balls and rolled in sugar before baking.  Next time I might flatten cookies and sprinkle with sugar, I don't know.  These didn't flatten much, which resulted in domed cookies.  They were very lightly crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside.  Probably the perfect sugar cookie.  Not sure the difference between tea cakes vs cookies, but this will be my go to recipe for sugar cookies.  Could easily alter by adding lemon, rolling in cinnamon, frosting, etc.  But we loved them plain!  Though that's not the right word; with all that flavor they were anything but plain.  Delicious cookies!

Liked this recipe. I piped a little dab of butter cream icing on the center of each little cake. Made them look pretty & was very tasty too!

I added a little water, about 1/4 cups, the dough became much more liquidy but when they cook they become really thin and flat. I think they look more appealing that way.

Simple, tasty, and full of potential. I made them with margarine but they still tasted incredible.  And all I could think was:  they'd be perfect to make "strawberry shortcake cookies" or iced cookies or glazed cookies or ....  I am so excited by having this canvas!!!

These are wonderful! Reminds me so much of my grandmother.  I used to beg her to make tea cakes. I also tried a variation with a little lemon extract and they tasted like the old fashioned lemon cookies we used to get from the bakery. Thanks!!

I have earned undying gratitude for reproducing "real" teacakes for a friend thanks to this recipe, thank you, I'm passing that gratitude along!

I can be horribly lazy, so my 2nd batch I just rolled into balls and flattened a bit and they were simply fantastic, and SO much quicker.

This was my first time baking without my family members, and i was pretty skeptical about it. When i saw the tea cakes, they were slightly golden on the edge but pretty pale. But as i took a bite, rich flavor burst out! This was the best results i have ever tasted! Far better than the others i've baked with my family. They all had bland taste; while these tea cakes add colors to my tea time. This is my first time reviewing. I hope it shows how this recipe is perfect for rookies, and how amazing it cake out.

I didn't have vanilla so I used almond extract. Sorry. While I was just beginning to make these my son's friend dropped by. The boys helped me with this easy, kid-friendly, recipe. They loved the end product and they seemed to impress the other mom. Thanks for making our day pretty special and helping create a great memory. I'll sneak a few more after bedtime for myself!

Great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I haven't had a teacake since high school.  Very similar to the ones my best friend's grandmother use to make for us.  However, not quite.  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing

This is a nice, basic cookie recipe.  I added a bit more flour and baking powder, rolled and flattened the cookies prior to baking, and added a few minutes to the bake time, and the flavor was delicious. Nice and light, very easy, and not too sweet.

I will admit I had no butter and had to substitute (even though it was recommended not to) something else.  I used the Smart Balance sticks and chilled the dough.  They came out GREAT!  I will make this again!  I used my small muffin cup silicon to make them just had to add a minute to the time.  Next time I make them, I'll try some nice icing or a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar.

Very nice, it was quick and easy to make.  Was craving something sweet the other night and came across this recipe.  Didn't have to run to the store and get additional ingrediants, everything was all ready in the pantry.  I will be making this again.

I have made these cookies at least 6 times in the past few months and my husband who had never heard of tea cakes now prefers tea cakes over chocolate chip cookies and that's saying a lot as for me they remind me of my childhood and making these with my mom and grandmother

I made these on Wednesday.  They are great with Earl Grey Tea.  The only thing that I added was a teaspoon of butter extract for a really rich buttery flavor.  It is such a simple recipe.  I will definitely be making these again!

Cookies are soft and delicious!!! Whenever I bake these I get lots of compliments and requests for more. I always chill the dough (up to 24 hrs) before baking cookies.
