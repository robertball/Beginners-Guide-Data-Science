This recipe tasted NOTHING like egg nog.  My husband did find that if you increased the Irish cream and added two heaping tablespoons of sugar, it did make it more palatable.  But it still did not taste like your grandma's egg nog.  My suggestion: skip the milk, the egg, and the Irish whiskey and just drink the Bailey's straight.
