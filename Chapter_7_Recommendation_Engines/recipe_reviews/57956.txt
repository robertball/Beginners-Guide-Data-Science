I think it is important to use KOSHER salt on this one

This was the best turkey I've ever made!  It was moist for the entire week of leftovers.  I did a 16 pounder and it was plenty.  After taking it out of the brine, drying it and letting it come to room temp, I rubbed it with butter herb rub of sage, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.  Added sald and pepper and cooked.  Delicious!  Thank you!

This was awesome!  Next time I will reduce the salt just a little, but I am really looking forward to using this brine again!  I liked that it didn't need a super long time to brine, too.  I have never cooked a better turkey.

I brine a lot of turkeys and chickens and I've used a lot of different brines.   This is the first one that I've ever used that didn't contain any sugar and also the first that used wine in a substantial quantity.   I brined my 9 pound turkey for 12 hours and then I rinsed it and moved the bird to a rack to dry and put in my fridge, uncovered for another 18 hours.   This will ensure that you get a crisp skin.   The end result was a juicy flavorful bird that was excellent in taste and texture.   I did not stuff my bird but I feel that this recipe would not have altered the flavor of the stuffing significantly and I think you could do that if you wanted.   I did not detect a wine taste at all, just a flavorful, juicy bird.   Thank you for a great recipe.

OMG!  Used this brine on a turkey breast pre-Thanksgiving meal.  Wow!  The texture and moistness was phenomenal!  I will never use another brine recipe!  It's not citrusy or winey, but it does some kind of magic to the turkey!  LOVE.

For years my mom has been plagued with dry turkey so finally this year I talked her into brining the turkey.  We used this recipe with a 10 lbs turkey and had amazing results!  We used kosher salt.  We let it brine overnight, which to our surprise it wasn't too salty (at least to our taste).  My sister who is a die hard dark meat fan actually preferred the white meat this time!  Definitely give this a try and use Kosher salt!
