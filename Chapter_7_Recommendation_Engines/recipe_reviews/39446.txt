I am on a low-carb diet and am doing great!  This is SOOOO good!!!!  I didn't even have the green onions or the green peppers and it still turned out great!  I cooked it for 30 minutes and it was done.

Zippy!!  We loved it!  I did not have the Mexican blend cheese so I combined Jalepeno Cheese with Mozzarella but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  Scrumptious!

This was great with lots of flavor. I added about 1/4 lb of cooked sausage to add some meat for my husband, but otherwise I didn't change the recipe at all. Will make this again.
