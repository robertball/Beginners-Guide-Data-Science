Great cookie! I made these exactly as the recipe directs, opting out of the trend to process only half the oats as many reviewers appear to be doing. This is a substantial cookie, full of rustic texture, but still chewy. I used 1/4 cup ice cream scoop mounds, flattened them slightly, and baked them about 10 minutes. The only thing I'll change next time I make these is toast the pecans first, but this is no criticism of the recipe, which is perfect as is. Not only are these delicious (a great GUY cookie!) but they're beautiful too.

This recipe makes the best chocolate chip cookies!

I took the advice of the previous reviewer and ground only half of the oatmeal to flour.  

This is the first chocolate chip cookie recipe I've made in quite a while that turned out perfectly consistent cookies... Still chewy, not DRY and crumbly.... Even down to the last cookie in jar!  I made the large batch as given and they didn't even last our family a week.  Look forward to trying the freezing suggestion.

Thank you SO much for this wonderful recipe.  Your graciousness will be cherished by our family for life.  (recipe may just make it in to our holiday festivities in the form of a stocking stuffer ;)

I am surprised that this recipe hasn't gotten rave reviews! Whenever I make it I get people who say, "That's an insanely good cookie." I don't grind all the oats into oat flour; I only do 1/2 ground, 1/2 whole. I also add a cup of lightly chopped Rice Chex. If I have a nut-averse crowd, I used more Rice Chex. (Also, I use an ice cream scoop for dropping the cookies onto the pan. The size, I think, affects how chewy or dry the cookie will be. Ice cream scoop size makes for a good sized, chewy cookie.) Yummy and reliable.

These are just like my grandma's oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Followed the recipe, but I also only processed half the oats and left other half whole. Omitted the nuts. I used an ice cream scoop to make extra large cookies and baked them for about 8 min. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Pretty darn good.  Though I was a little short on the oats, cut both sugars to 3/4 cup, used Butter flavor Crisco, had walnuts instead of pecans, and added in some Heath Toffee Bits (needed to use up the bag!).  DH was even suckin' these down, and he "hates" nuts.... Yeah, right.

Very good cookies, and I am only giving it less than five stars because it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If you love super sweet cookies, then these are for you!  I will make these again for sure, but I will decrease the sugar to 3/4 C of each next time.  But this time around, I followed the advice of other reviewers and only processed have of the oats, leaving the rest whole.  I used an even mixture of semi-sweet and white chips for this, and added dried cherries in place of the nuts, since my hubby and son both have allergies to nuts.  I also took the ice-cream scoop tip from another and the recipe made 24 HUGE cookies!  Delicious!

I made these without the nuts. The only problem I had was due to the oat flour, which made the dough really stiff and hard to work with. Otherwise, both my husband and I really enjoyed them - a good cookie, thanks for sharing :)

Very good cookie.  I made half the recipe which  yielded 32 medium size cookies.  Cooking time was right on, perfect at 10 minutes.  I brought these to a party and got several compliments.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing !

i used crisco in place of the butter (all i had) and i ended up using way less white sugar then the recipe called for (i ran out)and added a little extra brown sugar to make up for it. my 3 year old said these were the best cookies ever. these were good but mine didnt spread, prolly my fault. but very tasty

I've been making this cookie for a long time now, it's one of my fiance's favourites!  The only things I do different are I only use 1 1/2 cups of the oat flour and leave out the nuts.  I also add 2 tbsp of milk and 1 to 2 cups unground oats (depending on how I'm feeling ;).  This makes the cookies keep their shape better, but keeps them chewy.  The dough is hard to mix together, so I just use my hands for that instead of a spoon.

Great cookies - they will become a regular.  I added 1/4 cup of ungrounded oats just because I like a chewy, whole oat every once in a while :)

I love these - wonderful flavor and texture.  Followed other readers suggestions and only did half the oats as flour.  Also, used milk chocolate chips because that's what we had and they are truly delicious.

These were very tasty- I got 42 cookies out of the recipe.  My only complaint is that they spread out quite a bit when cooking, which led to a thinner cookie.  I tried to refrigerate the batter in between batches, but it didn't make a noticable difference.  I also baked them on parchment paper. Next time I may substitute Butter-Flavored Crisco, as I prefer the plumper cookies made when using shortening.  This recipe was still very tasty and chewy.  I will make it again with modifications.

These were GREAT!
Easy to make and hard to stop eating.

I altered the recipe just a tad by using 1 cup of white chocolate chips and 1 cup of semi sweets.

I will make these any time someone wants chocolate chip cookies.

YUM!

This recipe is so good.  My husband loved it and asked me to make more.  I cut the recipe way down just to try it out.  He was like "where is the rest?"

I absolutely loved the dough for these! The cookies were pretty good too. I did add plain m&m's in place of the choc. chips. I just like them better.

This recipe is great!!! I have a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have used for years! But I think I just found its replacement! The oatmeal flour is so perfect in this recipe! It gives it a great texture, and little oat pieces remain in your mouth after your done eating, which makes the cookie last even longer!! I used 3/4 cup white sugar instead of 1 cup. Turned out great!!! Froze the rest of the dough, and baked them a couple nights later, and those seemed almost better!!
