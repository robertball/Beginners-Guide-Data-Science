Great recipe, easy and filling.  Very spicy (Still good without the peppers).  Serve with warm tortillas or chips.  The only thing that isn't easy is that I have trouble finding chilies and hominy in my local stores.

I would give a star to the group that submitted this recipe only because it is simple and very easy to follow. However cooking the meat for only
5-6 minutes is very dangerous...if you a dealing
with pork or chicken. For anyone who wants to try
this recipe just make sure that the meats are fully cooked and that the flavors have mellowed.

way too much hominy. i would use 2 cans instead of four. and i doubled the chicken broth. all in all, good and filling, but somewhat bland.
