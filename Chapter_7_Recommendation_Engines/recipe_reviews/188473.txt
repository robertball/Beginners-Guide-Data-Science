This has got to be one of hubby's favorite meals. I make a buffalo sauce with 1/4 cup of melted butter and about 1/3 cup of hot sauce, and then season the sauce with some cracked pepper and garlic powder. Top it with lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese (preferably monterey jack), and ranch dressing   and I have a happy husband.

Yum! I did make a few minor changes, but this is a good recipe. I cooked my chicken breasts in salted water, then just tossed with Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce and just a little melted butter. I used Ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese out of preference. My fiance really loved this. Thank you! :)

Made some modifications, I cooked the chicken in simmering salt water for about 1.5 hours, until pull apart tender. Mixed together with 4 tbl melted butter, hot sauce, and garlic powder. Kids loved it for after school snack.

I always use leftover chicken for these and they're great for lunch.  I make my own wing sauce and add some shredded cheese.  These are a favorite in our house!

You can't get much easier than this.  It was also very tasty!  I didn't have blue cheese, so used ranch. My daughter and I enjoyed it.

Easy and delicious!  I also tried dicing the celery and sauteing it with the chicken just a bit before adding the sauce.  It was good that way...it retained the crunch too.  We added rice in the wraps the second time and it adds a little bit more substance.  I also topped it with a few extra bleu cheese crumbles just for kicks.  Great recipe!

Fantastically easy recipe.  I added a clove of garlic as I cooked the chicken chunks in a half and half combination of Smart Balance and Canola.  Used Louisiana Brand Hot Wings Sauce and bag salad.  Yum!

Quick, easy and good! Used 2 cups of buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce. Used blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes, lettuce and ranch dressing and was perfect.

Loved these. I melted some cheddar cheese on the tortillas and added a little ranch dressing and my husband about died. I used shredded chicken, we like them better that way. Fast, easy and delicious.

Very good recipe! Quick and easy, something I always look for when I'm cooking. I grilled the chicken instead of frying it, and used coleslaw mix instead of lettuce.

Mmmm, these are good... I used buffalo wing sauce and wheat tortillas. After I cut up the chicken, I added about 1/4 cup of bleu cheese crumbles (they melted nicely and spread the flavor throughout). I didn't add the celery (bc we didn't have any), but added lettuce and tomatoes. We dipped them in ranch to cool down the heat of the buffalo sauce. We really liked these and they were super quick :)

My step-son loves these. I usually add butter to the hot sauce or buy Hooter's Wing Sauce. I also sometimes do the chicken in the crock-pot.

These wraps are by far, my husband's favorite meal!  I add about 4 tbsps of butter to the hot sauce mixture for taste, however, for ease of preparation and less mess while eating, I make a couple of modifications.  I slice the chicken into long strips and I slice the celery stalk the long way and add it to the wrap whole to add support to the wrap.  I also use 1 whole romaine lettuce leaf as a liner under the chicken, celery and bleu cheese. This way, nothing falls out and we get a little bit of everything in every bite!  YUM!!

I love this recipe!  I bake the chicken at 375 for 25 minutes rather than frying it in oil to cut down on the fat.  Then I toss it with hot sauce and blue cheese dressing.  Comes out AMAZING!  Anyone who loves buffalo chicken will love these.

Love these and make them all the time. Even made them for a couple friends and they couldn't handle the heat. Very simple and delicious. I go the cheater route and just use chicken strips from the freezer section, but I like a good crunch and breading. I also like that these are totally customizable. Each oerson wraps there own with the special things they want. Everyone is different.

I think I may have added to much blue cheese for my taste, also I can't seem to find any buffalo sauce in the stores that I enjoy as much as any wing place.  I also used whole wheat tortillas which I wasn't to fond of.  Overall I believe I strayed to far from the recipe and I would probably use breaded chicken breast and no blue cheese next time and go with ranch instead!

I used this recipe to make a quick lunch that literally took me minutes to prepare. I used frozen grilled chicken strips (had coupons for Tyson) and heated them up in a small skillet pan.  I added barely a tsp of butter and canola oil as well as some hot sauce to taste as well as a pinch of garlic powder.  I served it on a whole wheat tortilla with some lettuce, shredded cheese and ranch dressing.  It was so easy and made for a quick meal:)

Made it as is but substituted ranch dressing for the blue cheese and these were an instant hit in our house. There was enough left over for lunch the next day and they're even better cold. This is going to be a go to recipe because I always have the ingredients on hand.

Delicious!  Couldn't quite get the wraps rolled, but that will come with practice.  Everything together was delicious though!  One word to the wise - we used Louisiana wing sauce, not realizing that it's insanely spicy.  I can deal with heat, but not that much!  Just a heads up.  Otherwise, yum!

This is fantastic and so easy! I made this recipe even easier by buying Franks hot buffalo sauce and pre-cooked grilled chicken strips. Just saute the chicken in the sauce until hot and then make the wrap with lettuce, cheese and ranch. Ready in 5 minutes. Tasty and makes an easy recipe even easier!

I accidentally overcooked the chicken, but this was still excellent.  I didn't know how much my single chicken breast weighed, so I eyeballed the hot sauce.
I needed some cabbage for another recipe, so I shredded some and used it in place of the lettuce and celery.  I replaced blue cheese dressing with finely-cut cheddar.

These were good but not great, however, that could be due to a few changes that I made due to what I had on hand.  I used left over grilled chicken thighs that I tossed in the hot sauce and let sit in the fridge overnight-this gave the chicken great flavor.  I used blue cheese crumbles since that is what I had on hand.  The wraps were a bit dry and maybe if I had used the blue cheese dressing that would have helped with this issue!  It did make a quick, cool meal on a busy and hot night.  Since no one raved over it, I probably won't make it again but I am glad that I tried it!

What a wonderful idea. My family loved this and I only made a quick (not as good) version of this with those frozen chicken patties, fried and cut up into strips and hot sauce sprinkled over the top. It made for a tasty and quick lunch.

02-29-16 ~ Simple and delicious. I prepared my chicken in the morning by poaching the chicken and then cutting it in bite size pieces. Once that was done, I added the buffalo sauce and put it in the fridge for the entire day. When I got home from work, I put the chicken in the oven to heat it up while I prepared the rest of dinner. We loved this wrap, I loved preparing it in the morning as it made getting dinner on the table quick, when I got home from work. Served it with 'Broccoli Strawberry Salad' from AR, cooked carrots and cucumber slices.

Tried this last night and it was great! All was eaten, and in fact I wish I would have made more because we were hankering for seconds! In addition to the bleu cheese, I sprinkled some shredded parmesan on the wrap (cheese addict). I also warmed the tortillas a little before filling them. Delicious! Thank you for sharing, I will make these again!

Delicious and sooo easy!!!! I added minced garlic to the chicken while it cooked. I also added diced tomatoes and shredded cheddar. This is going to be on my regular rotation from now on.

This is a huge hit in our house!  You can also broil the chicken (I fillet and then slice into strips after it's cooked) then toss it in the sauce (and we like wing sauce instead of the hot sauce).  Good on whole wheat tortillas too.  The celery in the wrap make it.

These were good wraps but expected them to have more heat for a Buffalo wrap.  I'll be playing with it to make it spicier!

Very good wrap! A quick, easy and tasty meal.  I melted the butter first then  added the oil some diced onions and then the chicken. I used leftover rotisserie chicken breast because I was looking for a way to use it up. We topped our chicken with ranch, celery, tomatoes and lettuce. Great for lunch or dinner.

Wow! Yummy! Easy to throw together-especially if you use rotisserie chicken like I did. Made a buffalo sauce using hot sauce, butter & honey to give it a slightly sweet hot punch. Great receipe!

I did a little different. I seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper and baked. While baking i heated franks hot sauce and butter with pepper and a little sugar. I tossed the chicken in that after the chicken was rested and cut. I also used ranch instead of blue cheese. Just my preference. I also added raw onion to the wrap  thinly sliced

These have become a "twice a monther" in my house. I took some advise and just boiled the chicken in lightly salted water. It was really juicy! Everything else I did the same...just used ranch instead and added green onion. Very good! Thanks isk

Very good, perfect for a quick meal.  Sour cream is a great alternative for those against bleu cheese dressing.  Cheddar cheese is a wonderful addition.

This wrap is full of flavor! I went a little heavy on the blue cheese sauce which made it a little salty, my bad. The celery gives a nice & cold crunch.

Fantastic!!  I had some marinaded chicken leftover from another meal that I wanted to use up.  I grilled the chicken on my Foreman and followed the recipe from there.  Besides the lettuce, I also added some red onion & ranch (personal preference).  You could not go to a restaurant and find a sandwich this good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these wraps exactly as the recipe stated and the kids loved them. They also only too a whopping 15 minutes from start to on the table. So I love how easy they are. Kids gave them 5 stars, hubby only 3. I think he would like them better if the chicken were saucier and more like hot wings. I'll have to experiment, but this will become a go to recipe for a quick dinner on hectic days.

First of all, based on taste, these were a six! However, I made modifications to the recipe because of what I had on hand. Changes: 1) I omitted the celery (we don't like it) and lettuce (didn't have any), 2) I added shredded cheese & chopped tomatoes. These are great! Definitely going to put this one into our normal rotation.

I used the Hidden Valley ranch packet and made homemade ranch dressing instead of blue cheese....Everyone loved these and they are the go to in the fridge when the kids need something healthy and quick before sports.

My dinner line-up needed a boost and this was it! The kids eyes lit up when I brought them to the table. We prefer crispy chicken so made them with egg white and Panko crumbs and baked to save time and fat. Used flat-outs instead of tortillas. Honestly never realized how easy this popular (overpriced!) sandwich is to make at home. Yum!

Absolutely delicious. A big hit in my house. Added 1 chopped tomato. Baked 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut to small strips and sautéed with celery for a few minutes. Added 2 teaspoons of melted butted with 1/3 cup Louisiana wing sauce. Topped with ranch dressing and cheese. Served with seasoned fries. Yum yum yum!!!

Had leftover shredded thicken to use up and was soooo glad I found this - had everything in the house already except lettuce (which would have been a nice addition).  Used ranch dressing and peeled in little chunks of gorgonzola dolce. Really good. Found the whole thing very salty and the sauce poured out of the wrap, so will add just enough to get the chicken coated next time.  Added shredded cheese but didn't find that it was needed - I think it just added to the salt content.

I made these along with another wrap for lunch the other day.  I must say they went over really well.  My boys do not like Bleu Cheese dressing so they used Ranch and they were just as tasty.  I followed the directions exactly and there were no leftovers:)  Super easy-super good.  Thanks for sharing!  I will make these again.

My husband loved this!   I did the chicken with a little crumbled bacon, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and ranch dressing.  I warmed it all up and microwaved it for 20-30 seconds. Then cut it in half and served it with seasoned french fries.  He gave it a 10 out of 10 and asked for seconds!!!!!!

I used chipolte tabasco sauce for the hot sauce and it was great!  I didn't measure the hot sauce, just went by my taste.  Also melted some cheddar cheese on the chicken.  Not a fan of blue cheese, so I used ranch.

This is an excellent recipe.  It was so quick and easy to put together.  My family has some picky eaters, and everyone ate this up!  I recommend though adding enough buffalo sauce to coat it, but allowing people who like it spicier to add more sauce to their chicken when they put it on the wraps.

I absolutely loved these and so did the kids and husband.  We will be making these when there isn't enough time to make real buffalo wings.  This is a great recipe as is -- next time we may add cheese to it.

Very Yummy! I used Buffalo chicken wing sauce instead of hot sauce, and added blue cheese dressing directly too it.  I also boiled chicken, shredded it and let it simmer in the sauce. Top with cheese and lettuce. Spicy, but YUM!! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe for when you don’t have time to cook! The only things I did differently is that I used ranch and combined 1/2 cup Frank’s red hot  with 1 teaspoon honey and 2 tbsp butter for the sauce

So quick and tasty.  My husband likes it “hot” so I divided the chicken into his serving and mine before adding the hot sauce.

This was a big hit! I used organic chicken Tendenders from Food lion.  Boiled them and cooled them, then cut them into 1/4 in pieces. Pan fried them with FL cooking spray (0gm everything) with Texas peat hot sauce and organic ground cumin until well coated and hot, put them on side burner on low. I used Spinach and herb tortilla wraps heated in a large pan per directions. Removed from Pan placed seasoned chicken, Chilled Ro-Tel original diced tomatoes and green chilies, Black beans, and Food lion Mexican four cheese blend. Wrapped them an cut in half. Drizzled Texas Peat Hot Sauce on top for those who wanted extra Kick.  Defiantly Recommend!

We are trying to eat clean so I wrapped in romaine lettuce.  I used franks buffalo sauce and skipped the butter. My only topping was blue cheese crumbles.

I sautéed chicken and wing sauce in olive oil top with fiesta cheese and warm tortilla wraps and served with yellow saffron rice & broccoli.  Delicious!

Works great for a light, quick lunch. I used Frank's Red Hot as the Buffalo Sauce. Definitely a recipe I will make again.

Very quick and easy to make! Only substitution was that I used ranch instead of blue cheese. It worked great for a weekend lunch. Will definitely be making again!

I loved this and so did my husband! I boiled my chicken and then shredded it and used whole wheat tortillas. I put the leftovers in the fridge and they were delish the next day for lunch. Will definitely make again.

Defiantly good. I left in the butter and oil when adding sauce to make it less ‘coating’, and more ‘somewhat absorbing’ the flavors. I only did this because I do not really enjoy a large buffalo flavor. Used garlic Parmesan dressing instead of blue cheese.

My husband loved this with the few things I changed.  I did not use  the blue cheese since he doesn't like it and added more wing sauce.  I also cooked the chicken with fresh  onion.  Thank you for this recipe.

I would love to be able to give this simple recipe double the stars. I've made this twice now. I used ranch instead of bleu cheese, and added bleu cheese crumbles (just for my husband who loves bleu cheese, the kids say it smells like the locker room at their jr high lol). If you haven't made this Please do. Side note: this is a pretty perfect game day food. Thank you so much for this deliciousness!! I'll be making this forever ;)

Not a huge buffalo sauce fan myself but the addition of the honey took the edge off for me.  It was a good, midweek meal.  Very easy and quick.

This is a great way to use store bought rotisserie chicken. It makes a fast, delicious meal for those on the go. I followed the directions and used Franks wing sauce. I added  crispy bacon and avocado.

This recipe is good and is very fast to prepare. I unfortunately did not have tortillas at hand but had low calorie flat bread, so I used it. I also did not have Blue Cheese dressing but had ranch dressing instead. The outcome was excellent. My only "modification" was to add powdered garlic and a pinch of celery seeds. It was just perfect. Will make it again!

I followed this recipe to a T, no extra modifications needed. I compared a wrap with Ranch dressing and Monterey Jack/Colby cheese with a blue cheese dressing and blue cheese wrap. Personally, I liked the blue cheese version, but both were good! Diced celery is a must, since it added a unique cruchy texture. The leftover wrap was delicious cold the next day for lunch!  Fantastic recipe and will definitely make it again!

I love buffalo chicken.....a great recipe I have use for a long time to make buffalo sauce is mixing ranch salad dressing and Frank's original hot sauce you can mix it in equal parts for a mild spice or reduce the either to make it spicier or more mild

It was spectacular goes down well with a Cold beer. I have also made some without the hot sauce and used tzatziki dip and chopped chives and extra cheese.

Everyone loved this. I like that you can customize it to each persons liking. I added blue cheese dressing to my husbands and mine but not the kids because they don't like blue cheese. For them I used buffalo-ranch dressing, though plain ranch would be good too. Made some changes. I boiled the chicken with salt, garlic and onions instead of cooking in butter and I used buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce. For myself, since I don't eat meat, I sautéed tofu in buffalo sauce. Also I added rice to the wraps for added substance and some shredded cheese. Okay so I made quite a few changes and some people may complain that I shouldn't rate the recipe because of that but without the basic recipe I never would have made this so this gets five stars from me.

This is sooooo easssssssy. I was cooking chicken for a family meal. I took some of that chicken and followed this recipe because my son LOVES buffalo anything. I really didn't measure I eye balled everything. The only things I did differently was I used fresh spinach instead of lettuce. I sprinkled on some sharp cheddar cheese and I used ranch dressing because that is what I had in the fridge. YUM. My son loved this. He said to make it again.

Good stuff as is. Definitely needs Ranch and plenty of cheddar cheese. I had some leftover bacon and threw a piece into each wrap which made it great!

Super simple and a great way to spice up a salad, we added shredded carrots and bean sprouts to the wraps. Most of us also omitted the blue cheese dressing. We used chicken we had leftover from baked chicken dinner the night before.

I didn't add the celery cause I didn't have any on hand. I used the precooked frozen grilled chicken strips. I thawed them, cooked them in a little butter and then added the hot sauce. Was so simple and good. Def a quick week night meal. Will make again.

My husband and I love these. When I'm in a hurry I will make it with the "short cuts" by Purdue. Already cooked and cut, I get them in the meat section at my grocery store! Great recipe!

Very easy and tasty midweek dinner.  I will definitely be making these again.  I left out the celery because I didn't have it.  Used Louisiana Hot Sauce.  The perfect buffalo sauce.

Yummy wrap. I took mine for my lunch. So the night before I made my chicken and put it in a tupperware dish with the hot sauce and shook it around. I had wraps and cheese at work so I warmed the chicken a little then put the tortilla on a plate and covered it with cheese and put the warmed chicken in the middle and cooked it until the cheese was nice and melted. I didn't have any ranch or blue cheese at work but they were still wonderful. Thanks.

WONDERFUL! I didn't have celery on hand but I used fresh cilantro which was a nice cooling agent for this recipe. I have also been on an arugula kick for the last 6 months so I used that in place of the lettuce and added tomatoes because I eat them with EVERYTHING! The whole family loved them and went back for seconds, and thirds. Good thing I shop in bulk.

This recipe was really quite good, although if I were to do it again I would have less hot sauce... It was a tad too spicey... maybe I'll try a different type of hot sauce...

These were very simple and pretty yummy!  I didn't use the celery and I have to suggest the Kraft Roca Blue Cheese Dressing, the dressing made the wrap!!

Good recipe. I make something similar only not as healthy! (fried chicken strips!) I tried this recipe and decided to mix the lettuce and celery in 1 tsp of ranch dressing.(cut in strips not diced) added some thin strips of carrots to the lettuce and let marinate about 1/2 an hour while I made the chicken. My hubby added cheddar cheese to his and also added the blue cheese. While not a healthy addition fat wise, I have to admit his was AWESOME!

Im giving these wraps 4 stars as a compromise between me and the husband. I thought they were great but hubby didn't like the flavor but couldn't pinpoint why. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to make it even easier to prepare on a busy work night. I heated the tortilla wraps slightly in the microwave to soften which makes them easier to roll. I will make again for me (hubby can go to McDonalds)!
