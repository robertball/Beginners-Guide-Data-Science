For me this is a pretty basic recipe which I do with a few variations of my own, like massaging the chicken with lemon rind and butter. One tip that I must insist on never, never cover the bird with foil or anything else while it rests or you will just steam the beautiful golden crust. It needs no coverng.

The perfect roast chicken – tender, juicy and SO flavorful.  True to its name, this really was succulent.  I stuck to the recipe fairly closely, although I rubbed the herb/olive oil mixture all over the chicken rather than just underneath the skin. I also stuck extra sprigs of rosemary and thyme and a good chunk of onion in the cavity along with the lemon.  I roasted the chicken at 450 degrees for 20 minutes, then reduced the heat to 375 degrees and roasted for another 20 minutes per pound. (I had a 5-1/2 pound chicken so it was in the oven about 2 hours)  I poured about a cup of chicken broth into the pan at the beginning, and the resulting juices made for a rich and delicious pan gravy, thickened just slightly with a little cornstarch and more chicken broth.  I served this with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes (in the same pan last 40 minutes of cooking), Cauliflower with a Kick, Easy Garden Green Beans, Pumpkin Soup and a tossed green salad with Creamy Peppercorn Dressing, all recipes also from this site.   With only six reviews, this recipe is not receiving the attention it should.

Great flavor combination. The lemon, rosemary and garlic complement each other well. I only had skinless chicken breasts on hand, so just put them on top the sliced lemon, spread the chopped garlic, rosemary, thyme, and olive oil mixture over the chicken and baked it for about 45 - 50 minutes. Probably should have baked them for a little less time. 40 minutes probably would have been about right for two chicken breasts that were almost 2 pounds. Be sure to scoop up some of the juices from the pan and drizzle on top the chicken before serving, for extra flavor and moisture (if you over cook your chicken like I did). Will definitely use this flavor combination again.

This is very good. I did change a few things though... I used dried herbs (about 1/2-1 teaspoon each), skipped stuffing the bird with garlic and used margarine instead of the olive oil. I combined the margarine, herbs, 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, lemon zest and salt & pepper in a food processor to get it mixed really well. Rubbed this under the skin and all over the chicken. I did add 1/2 cup of water into my baking dish to avoid burning. I used a 2lbs. bird so I cooked it for a little less time.

I always make another whole chicken recipe from here but I think Ill start swapping it up with this one. A beautiful bird and smelled so good. I did shove both lemon halves into the cavity. Served with broc cheese rice and a green salad and french bread. It didnt feel like a weeknight meal!

This has become one of our family's favorite recipe. Tender and juicy on the inside crisp and flavourful on the outside. Although the grade of the meat does factor into the juicy and tenderness of the meat. I always use fresh, airchilled chicken. I do add salt and to taste otherwise everything else as per listed. Perfect!

Good!  Moist and tender, just how we like:)  No lemons in the house, used lemon juice instead.  Served with sweet potato fries and roasted zucchini.  Will definitely make again!

I made two and it took 2.5 hours to get to temp. The lemon, rosemary mix was tasty.  I had to use dried thyme.

Get rid of the Garlic . I always considered garlic to be abused and used to confuse the taste buds. one taste of garlic in my mouth and i could be eating anything....Its like having food with your garlic-- I know great chefs use it in abundance---I i think poor chefs use it .

This was very good.  Baked it at 425 for 20 minutes then turned the temp down to 375 for 20 minutes per pound as another reviewer suggested.  It came out great!  We could taste the herbs and lemon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, basic, simple, straightforward recipe that yields predictable results for even inexperienced home cooks.  One thing that I always do when cooking chicken this way is to rub salt under the chicken's skin a day before I'm going to cook it.  I then wrap it tightly and refrigerate.  This allows the salt to be drawn into the meat thereby seasoning it more deeply and evenly than salting at the last minute.  (Don't try this with a kosher bird; it'll be too salty.)  I also use a remote reading, digital thermometer to insure that the bird is properly cooked each and every time with no guesswork.  It's funny how nearly everyone who gives an excellent rating to a recipe also makes changes to it before even trying it as written.  If the recipe is so great, why change it?

This has been my go-to roasted chicken recipe for years. My picky daughter asks for seconds and my mother who rarely eats meat looks forward to coming over when I make this. It’s a simple, yet delicious recipe to make.

This was easy and simple to make.  The chicken was moist and succulent.  My picky one year old loved it and that's saying something.  Thank you posting this.  I will be making this again.

Delicious!! This was the best dish so far.  I loved the lemon and garlic taste.  I would add more lemon zest and juice over the chicken next time.  Loved it.
