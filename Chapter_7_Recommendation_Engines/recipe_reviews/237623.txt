Haven't made one of these "impossible" pies in years.  I had some eggnog to use up and plenty of coconut on hand, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  And I'm glad I did, we thoroughly enjoyed it.  For anybody unfamiliar with the "impossible" concept,  ALL ingredients go into the blender, then you pour into a pie pan, and bake.  Yes, it's that easy.  The only change I made was subbing Truvia for the sugar, and I actually cut back the Truvia a bit, since we're not into "too sweet" these days. If you're an eggnog, coconut and custard fan, give this one a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Scaled the recipe and baked in an individual souffle dish since no one in my family likes coconut. Something I would make when I'm craving coconut. Fast and very easy.

It was amazingly delicious and how simple and awesome this pie was. I did not have nutmeg so I sprinkle with pumpkin spice and it was very good. I also cut back on the sugar and use a 1% eggnog. Very light and fluffy. 

What can you substitute for eggnog when it is not available?

Excellent!  I cut back on sugar using only about 1/2 c plus 1 T.  It was delicious.  A wonderful way to use up the left over eggnog.  Next time, I'm going to look for desiccated coconut as my blender left the shredded coconut with a bit more texture than I had hoped for.
