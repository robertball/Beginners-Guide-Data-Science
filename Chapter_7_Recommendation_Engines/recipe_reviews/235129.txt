As  this recipe's first reviewer,  I'm happy to give it an enthusiastic "two thumbs up."   This recipe for the classic "Lemon Pudding Cake," which I first made decades ago, is very basic and very reliable.  It bakes into a delicately lemon flavored cake layer on top to reveal  custardy goodness beneath it. Since this includes no butter,  I went with reduced fat milk rather than skim but made no other changes.  I think the baking time, at  50 minutes, is far too long,  tho' admittedly individual ovens may vary.  I would recommend the more traditional baking time of 25-35 minutes (and even less for ramekins).  You can always add more time, but you can't undo it if you bake it too long! I might also suggest that the water used for the water bath be very hot, if not boiling.

An easy to make 4 star dessert.  I used whole milk because i had it around, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  The top layer is like a light lemon cake and at the bottom is a gooey lemon custard.  Great served warm with some cold lemon ice cream.  The recipe isn't clear, but use ramekins.  This would not hold up well if scooped out of a large baking dish.  Also, this reheats very well in the microwave.  It took 60 seconds for me, but microwaves vary.

If you want a strong lemon flavor I would recommend increasing the zest and/or juice.  The lemon flavor is mild to medium

I made it and hubby enjoyed it. Substituted Splenda instead of sugar and used my KitchenAid mixer to whisk the egg whites. Came out great! Used a bit lage corning ware dish to bake in but didnt have enough ramekins. ( only had three) Thats the only thing I didnt follow. Used top baking rack on my double oven and not convection. Thanks for the recipe! Will make it again.

4.5 stars. Light and lemony...a welcomed change from heavy or traditional desserts (like chocolate). My husband liked it also so I plan to make it again. I put it in a 1 1/2 quart pan because that was all I had. 50 minutes baking time in a water bath was just right.

I made this for a friend who likes anything lemon. I’m not a lemon lover but it really is easy and he said it was delicious.

Oh man! This recipe was great! The only toughish part is whipping the egg whites it takes forever lol. But the end result is delicious! It is like Jello pudding met with lemon merengue pie and became one. I would make it again and definitely recommend it to family and friends!

This was truly simple and delicious. I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I did not have skim milk on hand so I used diluted half & half  instead.  I will be making this again

I doubled the recipe and used a 2Q casserole pan. It turned out perfect! It was light and refreshing.

I finally got around to trying this recipe. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice. I love it and so does my picky husband. He usually doesn t like anything lemon. I also like the fact that it is not difficult to make. I used an 8x8 pan and next time would put it in a smaller baking dish as it came out somewhat thin.

I used Meyer lemons. It tasted very good and held up better than my shuffle although with the flour and sugar it's probably higher in carbs.

For some odd reason mine came out with a dark brown burned crust but delicious perfect inside. I baked it for 40 minutes at 350 as per directions. I modified the recipe by using Swerve instead of sugar GF flour heavy cream instead of skim milk and add an extra egg.

I followed the recipe exactly but for some reason mine didn’t set up. I even cooked it 10 mins longer than it said. I may have not gotten the egg whites stirred in good enough because they seem to have separated and made a crust. So after a cold I just stirred it all up and it made like a pudding. Still delicious!

It tastes very good. I zested a whole lemon and then juiced it. It is a unique blend of custard and cake!

Easy to make and is delicious! I went the ramekin route and baked them for 30 minutes and they were just turning golden brown on top. We both liked this more when they were warm. Reheating them in the microwave worked great.

This dessert was soooooooo good and so easy to make. I made it with fresh lemons off the tree in our back yard. A hit with our guests. I will be making this again and again! I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and a chocolate covered strawberry. Oh and I baked it in 4 individual 4oz ramekins.
