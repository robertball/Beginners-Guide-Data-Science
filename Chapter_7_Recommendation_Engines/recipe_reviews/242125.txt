For the ease of preparation and relatively few number of ingredients (compared to other BBQ sauces I've made), this is quite tasty.  It's definitely got some kick to it, so if you don't like things too spicy, I'd recommend halving the black and red pepper, and/or leaving out the hot sauce.   I did find the vinegar a bit overpowering, so I suggest using a milder vinegar, such as apple cider, or using less white vinegar.  Using less vinegar would also solve another issue I had with the sauce being too thin. Next time I would definitely let the sauce simmer quite a bit longer so it could reduce and thicken. But again, given the ease and how quickly it came together, this is a good sauce. I did add 2 tsp of liquid smoke to give it more of a BBQ sauce flavor. I served this on some smoked ribs. Yum.

I made a double batch and added 1/2 cup of Maple Syrup and a tablespoon of Montreal Chicken Spice. Barbecued chicken legs and  got great reviews from the family. Thought the vinegar would be over powering but it wasn't. Going to try it on pork chops next.
