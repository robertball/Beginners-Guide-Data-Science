This is such an easy recipe to make, and even tastes great the next day.  I used Ore Ida Tator Tot and microwaved them for 5 minutes rather than cooking in the oven, to save a little time.  I did add plenty of pepper but other than that followed the recipe exact.  It was a kit with my kids, sure I will make this again.

Wow, this is an awesome recipe!  Brought it in for a work potluck and not only was it inhaled, 4 people immediately asked for the recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written except i used teaspoons of the chili powder and basil vs. tablespoons as I was worried it would be a little too much.  Easy to make and even easier to eat!  Will make again!

This is super easy and tastes great! Modifications I made to take to work: omit chili powder and pepper, use Turkey Breakfast Sausage, reserve 1/2 C cheese for top. Co-workers LOVED it!!

Well this is the second tune within 6 days that I've made this recipe upon my children and husband's enthusiastic requests so I'd. Say its a keeper. I followed recipe except I added a cup more cheese just because i had it in my fridge and added dry mustard to egg mixture because I like eggs with that little kick. I think the first time I forgot the chili powder but it was awesome anyway.  I made this for brinner (what my goofy family calls it when we have breakfast for dinner). We are a 5 crew family and we had enough left over to feed the 3 teenagers breakfast the next morning so yatzee on 2 meals in one!!

This gets 5 stars from me since I don't even care for sausage and I went back for me!  I prepped it a day ahead of time and kept in the frig.  I forgot to include the onion/spices when I browned the sausage, so I added the onion over the sausage when assembling and mixed 1/2 the spices in the eggs and sprinkled the other 1/2 over the sausage.  I left it on the counter while the oven preheated and then baked for 45 minutes.  I was a little apprehensive about 2 T and 1 T of spices, but they worked!  I couldn't find ground sausage, so I decased a package of Johnsonville Mild Sausage and used that.  I can see this finding a place in our breakfast casserole rotations.  THANKS for the recipe!

I tweaked the recipe a bit since I don't care for sausage and for convenience- now this has been the top requested food item at family gatherings the last three times we've gathered!  So, instead of sausage, I used 1lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. crumbled cooked bacon.  I bake the bacon in the oven in a shallow cookie pan on foil.  I only add the chili powder (no basil, onion or garlic)  to the ground turkey while I am browning it.  VERY tasty and huge crowd pleaser!  Put out the salsa for those who want top it off! Serve with melon (cantaloupe) cubes and gluten free Danish!

This is a 4 as written, but a 10 when cooked like "Cheesy Oven Scramble."  I crave breakfast egg casseroles... but like my omelets, I want them soft and not overcooked or dry.  HERE IT IS!!  Prepare this recipe and add anything extra that I like, but then cook it like the Cheesy Oven Scramble.

Bake it for a few minutes; then remove and stir the cooked out from the sides; then repeat until close to done.  REMEMBER TO REMOVE FROM HEAT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THEY ARE COOKED, STIR AND WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE STILL SOFT  AND THEN SERVE!!!!!!!!!  These breakfast casseroles all tell you to combine ingredients and then cook for 16 hours until the eggs are cooked in the middle.  Don't Do THat!!  Cook for a few miutes until the eggs on the outside edges are cooked, then STIR and move uncooked eggs to the outside to cook.  Heaven!!

I used crispy, center-cut bacon crumbles instead of sausage and baked the (coated with my favorite seasoning salt) tater tots almost all the way through before assembling. I really liked this dish and the leftovers were equally enjoyed. The only thing I would change is to either use shredded potato or tear up the tater tots into smaller pieces and add that and cheese to the egg mixture instead of layering potatoes on the bottom and pouring mixture over tots, because I felt the tots were too dense and blanded out the cheesy egg part of the dish. Or you could just add more egg and less tots.

Delicious easy recipe!   I used whole milk and cut the cheese in half to make this recipe a little healthier and it was still yummy!  I also added frozen peas and my picky two year old asked for seconds.  Thanks for sharing!

Great way to use up a lot of tots and eggs! Although, next time I would reduce the tots to about 25 oz. I used 28.7 oz this time and would have preferred more egg to potato. I didn't have raw sausage so used 5 oz ham and 6 oz andouille sausage. Instead of the chili powder, I used 2 t paprika and skipped the basil completely.

This was a hit at our morning study session today. I skipped the chili powder and the garlic, opting to season with salt and pepper instead. The sausage and cheese provided plenty of flavor. I also used 2% milk because that's what I had in the house. It was delicious!

I made this exactly as directed.  It was dry and very disappointing considering all the eggs and whipping cream I the recipe.  Will not make again.

Used this recipe as a guide for breakfast this morning.
Used maple link sausage - cooked and cut into pieces. Added sour cream and half and half to the eggs. instead of tater tots, 'cause we didn't have any, used hashbrowns instead.
This was a very lovely breakfast dish. Tasty and super easy to make. will definitely make again.

This was really good, with a few tweaks. I used Crispy Crowns and prebaked them, you don’t need the whole bag- will use maybe 1/2 or 3/4 next time. I used 9 oz bag of Jimmy Dean crumbles and sautés w/onion...added adobo spice and parsley instead of Chilli powder and basil. Only took 30 mins to cook in a stonewear Baker. Would definitely make again but reduce potatoes maybe add some more spice.

I prepared it the night before with frozen tater-tots (without baking them), and refrigerated it overnight. Baked it as instructed the next day, and it was great.

My family, including two teenagers, loved this as the filling in breakfast burritos. I substituted whole milk for the cream since I didn't have cream. I cut back the chile powder to 1 TBS and added a small can of diced green chiles. Served in tortillas with a little salsa, and everyone loved it.

I used ground turkey instead of sausage and cut down the chili powder to 1T.  I used heavy whipping cream as suggested, but thought about using 2% or whole instead. Maybe next time. This was a huge hit at the church brunch.

I made this to serve 24 men! It came out amazing! It was absolutely delicious and super easy! I mixed hot sausage with regular sausage which gave it a little extra kick. Also I seasoned the meat and onion with garlic powder instead of using garlic, came out better to me.  It took a little bit longer to bake, took me about an hour. It tasted amazing and everyone loved it! Easy to make for crowds.

This was pretty good.  I put the tots in microwave for 5 min. first. Otherwise, followed recipe.

This was great. I used Ore-Ida Tater Tots. And I added some green bell peppers. I layered it a little differently but no big deal :)
