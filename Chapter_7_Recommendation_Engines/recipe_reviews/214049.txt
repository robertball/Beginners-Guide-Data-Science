This was dinner tonight, made with my own homemade chili from the night before. I used Chili Cheese Fritos. Everyone loved it. HUGE hit. I was told by my family that this is the only way to eat chili now.

This is the famous Frito Pie! If you live in Texas, and have the guts to ADMIT that you don't know what Frito Pie is, people are amazed! It is a well-loved tradition, often served with rice and beans instead of chili, as well as grated cheese and chopped onion, and OFTEN served inside a single-serving bag of Fritos! DEEEEE-LISH!

I would much rather use chili made with beef, or my own recipe.  This recipe really brings back memories of yummy Frito Pie - back in the 70's you could get a great one at Sonic Drive In's in the South.. but no longer, they are horrible.  You can also pop openan individual bag of corn chips, dump some chili right in the bag and put your toppings on for a "Walking Taco".  They are a big hit at kids birthday parties.  LOL  I always made Frito Pie on Halloween Night - quick, easy and got the kids out the door FAST!  Thanks for the memories.  Now I'm getting hungry.

This is an old time favorite! And it doesn't even have to be a cold night! Keep in mind you can use your favorite chilli and try out some of those new flavored corn chips or even tortilla chips. Top with diced jalapenos, diced onions,sliced green onions, diced tomatoes or a combination of those. Not to mention the different cheeses like pepper jack or a nice mexican cheese blend. And don't forget that soothing dollop of sour cream!

This is much like the Famous Frito Pie, I prefer my recipe.  We like Wolf Brand Chilli, and I like it with no beans,  Use two cans to a large bag of Frito's, add as much cheese as you like on top, and bake in the oven to get the cheese melted.  You will have two textures softer fritos and crunchy...add whatever you like, sour cream, onions, different cheeses, tomatoes, even green chilli.......just great!  An old time fav that I introduced to my husband who had never had it.  My whole family loves this one.

Reminds me of my Friday night football games in Louisiana back in the 80's.  Frito pie.... I make my own chili and use plain Fritos.  Top with cheese. My son's friends are visiting us in GA.  They are from WV and requested that "thing" I used to make them with the chili and Fritos.  The infamous "Frito Pie".

I made some changes which gave it a more authentic flavor. Substituted ground beef, made 1 cup of my own red chili sauce and added a can of ranch style pinto beans. It was awesome!  Definitely a keeper.
