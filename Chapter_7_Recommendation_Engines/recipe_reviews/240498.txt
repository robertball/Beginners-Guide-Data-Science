Wife and I loved this dish, but this is a meal for 2-1/2 people, not 1.   We have it on our food calendar to make again.

Three slight modifications:  
(1) I think I misread the ingredients and used a whole 6 oz jar of oil packed sun-dried tomatoes rather than 1/2 half tomato (2)  Added 1/2 avocado sliced on top of the diced toms.
(3)  Made two tortillas and had left over scramble.

I made these for a potluck brunch party, and they were a hit! I made two big batches of the insides and just heated the tortillas at the last minute, stuffed them and put all ten wraps/burritos in a 9x13 glass pan to keep warm. I transported them to the party and it worked out well! My recommendation is to add a LOT more sun dried tomatoes, as that's the best part of this recipe!

My dad and I made it for breakfast, bug hit with everyone in the family. For my moms, we substituted her eggs with avocado. The whole thing was delicious.
