The ingredients are correct in this recipe but  it is missing a step that would solve the runniness problem.  You must drain the yogurt in a colander for a few hours.  This is the way they do it the Greek restaurants.  You should also salt and drain the cucumbers for an hour.  I tried this recipe and drained the yogurt first and it was great!

Good, but PLEASE NOTE: yogurt will break down if it is stirred with too much force--especially using a food processor! This is why some people had runny results even after draining the yogurt overnight. Instead, chop everything else up separately and gently fold it into the yogurt with a spatula.

This is some pretty tasty sauce!  So good, in fact, that I spent the rest of the evening scouring my pantry and fridge for things to dip into it!  Very garlicky so it's a bit hot...but I love garlic so that's OK with me.  I incorporated several of the tips that I found from reading other reviews:  drained the fat-free yogurt in cheese cloth over a bowl in the fride overnight, shredded the cukes then salted them and let them drain all day...I even patted them a bit with a paper towel to absorb some more moisture, and I mixed everything together very gently and let sit in the fridge to develop it's flavor.  WELL worth the effort!  This sauce was BETTER than many I've had out! Thanks so much Dinah!  Now I have a way to satisy my craving for Greek food!

Instead of using regular yogurt, substitute Greek Yogurt (my supermarket sells "Total"). This yogurt is much thicker than regular yogurt and therefore does not need to be drained. Also, you don't really need a food processor.

On the runniness issue:  tip from my mom--finely dice the cucumbers, put in a strainer add a little salt, stir.  Let sit for as long as you can take it to drain water.  Blot with a paper towel to remove more water.  Add into recipe as directed.  Enjoy!

To be truly superb, tzatziki MUST be made with strained, whole mild yogurt from Greece, otherwise the result will be runny as many users have noted.  Also lemon juice is preferable to vinegar.  But the one non-negotiable item is the strained, full fat yogurt.

Here's what you need to know for a fantastic Ziki sauce.

Use ONLY authentic Greek yougart. Strain will be needed. Or, if you don't like the overwhelming taste of Greek yogurt, and I don't personally, use 98% Sour Cream and 2% Greek Yogurt. 

DO NOT FEAR THE GARLIC FOLKS! GO AS CRAZY AS YOU LIKE WITH IT!. Personally, I use 3 1/2 to 4 large Elephant Garlic bulbs minced finely for that incredible, spicy garlicky kick! 

DO NOT put yogurt in blender. Stir / fold yogurt only by hand.

Place shredded and SEEDED cucumbers in a sprinkling of sea salt in a strainer for 3 hours then place in thick paper towels & wring cucumbers out hard by hand.

Add two LARGE spoon fulls of Sour Cream or Greek yogurt. (depending on which way you want the premise of this Ziki recipe to taste) It adds either a WONDERFUL creamy taste or a FULL authentic Greek taste.

Use one tsp. dried dill per one tlb. fresh (if nothing fresh on hand) but use 4 tbls fresh dill if AT ALL possible.

Be careful of adding too much salt to taste in this mix. With the salt you've already added to help drain the cucumbers and the salty taste of the lemon juice, it might over power your sauce.

Cracked pepper to taste.

Let sauce chill for at least 2 hours. The taste will increase exponentially with time.

Make a double batch as this sauce goes great with many dishes. Especially chicken and fish. This is a 5* recipe!

This is a good Recipe: HELPFUL HINTS: Drain your full fat yogurt in a cheesecloth for a couple hours. Also, salt your cucumber and then squeeze out excess water after 20 min or so. The flavor of this recipe is great. I think these things will make its watery consistancy even better:)

This was good, but it didn't taste like the "tzatziki" from our local Greek restaurant.  My family loves the one from the restaurant and I think we are just used to their's.  I think they use sour cream in addition to the yogart which makes it smooth and thick...I will work on it.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  We used it for the "gyrolls" on this site.

Really great alternative to the "real thing". We use this on chicken pitas,  I don't even bother to blend and I shred the cukes instead and add a couple tablespoons or so of sour cream....So good!

Wonderful sauce, however I didn't do it in a food processor. I just grated vs. dicing my cucumber and folded the ingredients together. Also, anytime you don't want watery cucmbers after you grate the cucumber add salt to them and then let them rest on papertowels to get the water out. Then give them a good squeeze if you don't do that the yogurt will be runny. Overall, very good.

I spent half a year in Greece, and this has all the ingrediants necessary for authentic tzatziki--but not quite in the right proportions. For the wateriness...make sure that you use full fat yogurt--greek yogurt (which is even creamier) if you can. This will taste awful with low or nonfat yogurt. The cucumber also MUST be strained. I usually peel and grate it over a strainer, then salt it to reduce the water content further. The recipe that I got in Greece uses a full bulb (roughly 12-15 cloves) of garlic rather than the 3 cloves called for here--and also 1/2 bunch of dill, finely chopped rather than a teaspoon. Overall, the recipe is a bit bland--but that can be easily amended

Good, but missing 2 VITAl steps. 1. Using a CHEESE CLOTH, strain the yogurt for about an hour. 2. SHRED the cucumber into a bowl. Add salt and let sit for 30 min. Then SQUEEZE the water out of handfuls of cucumber at a time. Place in another bowl. Mix all ingredients thoroughly. This will make a creamy, flavorful sauce just like it was from Greece. Enjoy!

The three most important steps in ensuring a thick flavorful Tzatziki are to:

1) unless you are using Greek yogurt which is pre-drained, drain you yogurt in a colander or in cheese-cloth overnight in the refrigerator to draw off the excess fluid.

2) after dicing the peeled and seeded cukes, put them in a colander, mix in 1 tsp of salt per cuke to help draw out the water.  You can drain them for as little as an hour but, overnight in the refrigerator is better.  The salt really draws out the water.

3) After a quick taste to make sure the salt/pepper ratio is OK, put the Tzatziki back in the refrigerator and let the flavors develop overnight.

Fabulous recipe! I always read through the tips from other reviewers, especially when venturing into unchartered waters. Where I live, we have many Greek diners around and a festival every June, so I've tasted this sauce many times..the result from this recipe is FANTASTIC! I found the following tips posted by others to be very helpful: (1) use Greek yogurt; (2) blend by hand with a spatula-don't use a machine; (3) drain the cucumbers - rather than using the salt method which I have done in the past, I layered the chopped cukes in a large bowl between paper towels then placed a plate on top and put a weight on that a let it sit for about an hour; (4) mixing the oil with the cucumbers before adding the yogurt-actually I mixed all of the other ingredients together and then added the yogurt last. We had this with baba ganoush and hummus for lunch with various breads and veggies...I only wish I had the ingredients on hand to make gyros..did I mention how fantastic this sauce is? To coin a phrase "yummo!"

I was able to find Greek yogurt at the supermarket (Trader Joe's and Lucky's have it), so I was able to skip the yogurt straining part. I followed the recipe for the most part, but following cues from previous reviewers, I strained the cucumbers (for one hour--I couldn't wait!), and then gently folded the ingredients all together with a spatula (with the addition of a sprinkle of paprika). After the ingredients  were mixed, I felt it could have been a bit thicker, so I put the tzatziki in a cheesecloth and let the entire mixture strain for about 30 more minutes. It came out tasting exactly like the tzatziki from my favorite Greek restaurant! My boyfriend couldn't stop moaning about how great it was and was scavenging around the kitchen for more things to dip in the sauce. I'm doubling the recipe and making a vat for him tomorrow, since he ate all of mine. :)

Just a note to everyone who doesn't want to take the time to drain yoghurt and cucumbers. 1) Use greek yoghurt. This is available almost everywhere, even small grocery stores in northern Maine. 2) Shred the cucumber with a box grater. Then place the cucumber in a clean kitchen towel and wring out the excess moisture.  The tzatziki will be good to eat right away but is better if left to sit for a couple hours so the flavours meld together.

This was very good - made it to go with a souvlaki recipe found on this site.  It was a tad watery, but I knew it would be as I didn't have time to drain the yogurt or cucumbers.  The flavor was still out of this world!

We didn't like the flavor of this sauce it was very runny. I followed the directions exactly and got something that I was NOT looking for. I do not recommend this recipe if you are looking for an authentic tzatziki sauce. My husband and I were truely disappointed.

I didn't love the flavor, but I may just not be a tzatziki sauce fan.  I did not have trouble with the consistency, so I wanted to give these tips to those short on time.  I drained the yogurt in a coffee filter for 30 minutes.  I also grated and salted the cucumber and let it sit for 30 minutes, then squeezed the iquid out.  These two short steps gave me great consistency (and I was surprised at how much liquid came out of both!).

As others pointed out this is a good starter recipe, but you have to use "thick" yogurt, store bough "greek" variety or strained in colander for a few hours in the fridge at home. Also the cucumber is shredded and squeezed/drain of the liquid before adding to yogurt or you will have a runny consistency far from the real Taztziki Sauce.

Truly excellent!  I do add 1/3 cup mayo and omit the oil.  I can eat it by the spoonfulls - seriously!  I make this as a sauce for Souvlaki (also on this website) placed in pita pockets with diced tomatoes.  Souvlaki with Tzatziki sauce is my husband and I's all-time favorite dinner.  Definitely seed, chop, salt, and drain the cucumbers and use fresh, squeezed lemon juice.  I do not need to drain the yogurt (but I don't use low fat) and I don't recommend using a food processor or blender.  MIX BY HAND to maintain some thickness.

I made this for my sis (and my) birthday (we're twins) and everyone there loved this.  We used Pita chips for dipping.  As my daugher said, "This tastes exactly like the Tzatziki we eat at our favorite Greek restaurant." It was wonderful.

I brought this in for a work potluck as a vegetable dip and it was a big hit.  Like some people suggested, I blended everything in the food processor and gently mixed it with the yogurt that I had let drain overnight.  It was a good dip consistency and tasted just like the tzatziki I get in my favorite Greek restaurant!

Awesome!  If anything, my sauce was too thick!
I took the advise of others, and drained the yogurt, and the cucumbers well. I folded everything into the yogurt after emulsifying everything else together. This was wonderful with the Gyroll recipe on this site.

Very runny - almost like a salad dressing, not a dip. 
I tried to dry the cucumbers some by salting and draining, but it was still very watery. 
Also on the spicy side - interesting twist. It tasted good, but I would prefer it if it were a dip, not dressing.
I will continue to buy it from a Greek restaurant until I find a better recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars but the person should advise people to use greek yogurt. You can't go making Tzatziki without greek yogurt.

Other than that it is perfect!

I love this tzatziki recipe.  The flavor is perfect.  I followed the directions exactly as stated and it tastes great but is a little runny.  Next time I will take the advice of others and drain the yogurt first.

For a kinder, gentler Tzatziki Sauce, consider using the juice of a juicy orange in place of the lemon juice.  Crush 2 or 3 cloves of garlic, and add to sauce.  Chill for an hour.  Oh my!

Overall this was a pretty good sauce, but it is still not as good as the greek resturaunts. I made a modification to this sauce, I used sour cream instead of yogurt because I didn't have any yogurt at the time and I used english cucumbers because it has less seeds in it. It's not as healthy as using yogurt but it made it more creamy. I used the sauce with deep fried calamari. Yum!

The taste is great but next time I will DEFINATLEY drain the cucumbers better and blend everything except yogurt then fold it into the yogurt.  I will use what I made this time in the food processor as a dressing...still great though!

This was fantastic.   I chopped the cucumbers instead of using the food processor and then I spread it over chicken in a pita.   Make a lot because it is hard to stop eating it.  It was even better on the second day.

Very good flavor though too runny for my taste. May try adding sour cream for some of the yogurt next time or something else to thicken it up. Great taste, though!

I really like this recipe and tweak it to suit our tastes, but it's perfect as written. (I omit the olive oil, and drain the yogurt. As well as salt and drain the cukes. It really does make all the difference!

I have a pampered chef chopper that I use to mince the cucumber, I then drain the liquid and add the rest of the ingredients except the yogurt. I use GREEK Yogurt instead of regular. Much thicker consistency. I fold all the ingredients into the yogurt and it holds up very nicely! Note: If you prefer a little "saltier" dip, use Garlic Salt and omit table salt! YUM!! Making Chicken GYros with it tonight!

Drain, drain, drain!  That's the key to a good dip.  I've made this without the oil and it works just fine.  Instead, use the oil to spread over quartered & split pitas that you dust lightly with garlic salt & bake at 350 for 5 mins on each side.  Great for dipping.  Yum!

Another way to get rid of some of the liquid from the cucumbers is to seed the cukes, shred them, and squeeze them in cheese cloth. Gets rid of a lot of liquid without adding additional salt.

Drain the yogurt overnight in a clean nylon stocking. No food processor needed, just shred the cucumbers, squeeze out as much water as possible in a strainer, and fold all of the ingredients into the yogurt. Delicious!

Although this tastes like Tzatziki sauce, it has the consistency of a poorly made cream soup.  Click back and check the recipe for Tzatziki VII, and follow the submitter's instructions for draining the yogurt and cucumber.  I wish I had.

this was so so. Very thin, even after draining the cucmbers and yogurt for an hour. The taste was ok, but no quite what Im looking for. I think next time I will use 1 cucumber, will drain the cucmber and  yogurt longer, use more dill, and add a touch of fresh mint.

This was easy to make and good.  As suggested by other users I drained the yogurt over cheesecloth in the fridge overnight.  It was unbelievable how much water drained off.  I also shredded the cucumber, salted it and drained it over cheesecloth in the fridge overnight.  The tzatziki sauce was of a good consistency but I can see how it would have been runny had I not drained the yogurt and cucumber.

This was wonderful! I served this on shrimp pitas with sauteed green peppers and onions. I also followed another users' suggestion to fold the ingredients into the yogurt instead of using the food processor, and let it sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good, not as good as at the local Greek restaurant though.  I drained the water out of the cucumber before adding it to the yogurt.  I think there would have been way too much water if they would not have been drained.  Good recipe, goes great with Sean's Falafel.

I adjusted the measurements/ingredients a bit.  I love lemon, and used the handheld blender to mince some of the cuc's with the garlic to thicken it a bit and left some cuc's chunkier.  All in all, I just loved it!!!  It's just like the sauce served w/Greek dishes when I have it out.  I refrigerated it overnight to have it with the souvlaki I made the next night.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  Thank you Dinah! :)

Like many of the other posts - I also found this recipe way too runny the first time round and was left with a watery mess. I  very quickly added some sour cream to thicken it up  (needed to serve it right away) which of course diluted the flavour and never really did thicken it up much more. Second time around,  I drained the cucumbers and yoghurt over cheese cloth in the morning and by mid day (roughly 6 hours later) I combined all ingredients, blended by hand, and left in fridge to until our late evening meal.  PERFECTO!

I agree with Paula Wood. You must salt and drain the cucumber for at least an hour. It releases a large amount of water. Then rinse with water and squeeze dry with paper towels. I also use half Greek yogurt and Kefir cheese. It produces a rich, creamy Tzaziki.

I love this!  Peel, cut lengthwise and scrape out the seed of the cucumber.  Then, then grate the cucumber and squeeze it in your hands over the sink taking out most of the water.  Stir it into the yogurt.  It may not be as thick as the Greek yogurt mixture.  But, it's a lot faster and you'll like just the same!

Excellent sauce- tastes just like the restaurant version. Had it with shish tawook wraps for dinner. Drained the yogurt while I chopped up the cukes, and it wasn't runny at all. Also made sure to cut out the seeds. I just combined the ingredients in a bowl with a whisk instead of dirtying the food processor, and that worked well. Highly recommend!

Followed directions best I could, but it was VERY soupy.  Next time I'm adding 1/3 of a small to med cucumber only...I think this recipe should state size of cucumbers or after chopped how much by the cup.  The taste was ok, but was looking for a creamy, authentic recipe.  Bit disappointed in this one~

The recipe here is good in terms of taste, but I had problems with the consistency of the dip... very runny. This was solved easily by straning the dip with cheesecloth and a fine strainer/colinder, but I sure wish I would have known to do this beforehand!

Fantastic taste.  Wonderful on pitas with chicken.  I used fresh from garden cucumbers and homemade yogurt.  You do need to strain the yogurt 'til thick though.

I didn't have cucumbers so I am guessing that is a key step, i did use greek yogurt so it was nice and thick. we enjoyed the flavor in our veggie pita pockets

This was very very good with a couple changes per other reviewers.  I used the already strained greek yogurt and also strained minced cucumber on a few coffee filters.  After an hour, I folded up the filter and squeezed the juice out of the cucumbers.  I cut the dill in half and put 2 cloves of garlic.  This was very good and thick.  Not only was it great on my gyros from this site, but very good with raw veggies.

Great balance of ingredients, but the method of preparation can be improved.  I drained the yogurt while it was still in the container (I just held a large spatula @ the top of the container to hold the yogurt in place as the liquid drained).  Then I cut my cucumber into chunks, salted them w/ a good pinch of salt & let them sit on a few layers of paper towels on a plate for just a few minutes.  I then placed all of the ingredients EXCEPT the yogurt into a food processor & processed until chunky/coarse.  Next I folded the cucumber mixture into the yogurt & then let it set in the the fridge for an hour.  Perfect!

Better than most restaurant Tzatziki I've had. Anyone saying different isn't used to authentic.   Used Greek Yogurt, salted the cucumbers for 1 hour as suggested by others. We also added double garlic and dill since we are garlic/dill fanatics.   Also folded ingredients into the yogurt, instead of putting into a food processor as others suggested.

Pretty nice taste, but it was thin, watery and not what you'd expect a dip to be like. I've been to Greece and had Tzatziki sauce, and it is WAY different - it has more of a yogurt-like texture. Maybe adding some sour cream or fat-free cream cheese would help the consistency and texture.

Tastes great, but for the right consistency make sure you drain the yogurt and salt and drain the cucumbers as well. I only used one cucumber instead of two.

I was very disappointed with this recipe because it was still too watery and I even drained the yogurt overnight and salted and drained the cucumbers for about 3 hours. I didn't like the consistency of it either. I will not be making this again.

We couldnt find plain yougurt to save our souls the day I went to make this. TWO trips to the store and two containers of vanilla yougurt. So the Queen of improvision. I used One cup thick sourcream, 3/4 cup mayo, one grated cucumber squeezed of excess water, four good size cloves of garlic, about twoish tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, 2ish teaspoons of dill ( I think that  they both really depends on your taste ) pinch of black pepper to round out. I mixed it all together and got what really reminded me of the sauce I got back in college when I discovered greek food. The family loved it and want me to to keep it in the fridge for everything from dipping veggies to using on baked potatos.

I made this sauce hoping for great results.  My husband travels for work A LOT and often will eat Greek food at different restaurants.  I decided last week I wanted to make something while he was home, so along with the Slovaki from this sight, I made this Tzatziki sauce to go with it.  I have to admit, I don't eat Greek food too often (I am home with 3 kids!) so I didn't have a strong opinion.  I felt it turned out great after following other reviewers suggestions on draining the yogurt (which I did through a coffee filter).  But my husband felt it wasn't quite right, so I gave this 3 stars.  I did chop and salt and let the cucumbers sit as other people suggested and then put all ingredients except the yogurt in my food processor.  I think I had too much garlic, my cloves were fairly big, and my husband commented on the strong taste.  He also said the Tzatziki he is accustomed to is typically a bit more chunky, so next time, I won't blend all of the cucumbers, I will leave some to mix in.  I also had to mix a little more yogurt (undrained) and I mixed a big spoonful of sour cream just to try and make it a bit creamier.  In the end, we enjoyed it.  I thought it was great, my husband, pretty good. Going to try Yia Yia's Tzatziki sauce from this sight next time...looks like it might have the consistance I am looking for.

Pretty good. For those with runny yogurt problems, try using Fage Greek Yogurt. It doesn't separate!

YUM YUM!! I strained the yogurt in the fridge for about 1.5 hrs before I made this and I shredded the cukes and strained them too.  It was fabulous! creamy and garlicky and yummy :)  If I hadn't strained it it definitely would have been too runny.  I also didn't bother food processing it, I like the crunch of the cukes.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe :)

Grated the cucumber and strained all the excess liquid out,  I used non-fat Greek yogurt which I also strained. Added dried dill instead of fresh dill because it was all I had.  The flavors are fantastic!

I LOVED this. I've tried many, but this is THE ONE. I made Traditional Gyro Meat from this site and it was the best gyro ever. I'll use this for gyros and dip for pita chips and veggies. I used greek yogurt and I recommend that instead of regular yogurt.

This recipe turned out really great! The differences I made were using two 6oz containers of plain Greek yogurt + 2 tbsp of sour cream and instead of the fresh dill (which I didn't have) I used a half tbsp of dried dill weed and instead of 3 cloves of garlic I just used one large one and it was plenty. Definitely make sure you get as much moisture out of the cucumbers as possible. I used a couple coffee filters to squeeze out what I could and then let it sit over a colander for a few hours. Another tip I found helpful was to fold in your yogurt LAST to avoid breaking it up. Lastly, letting it sit in the refrigerator really does make a difference in taste and texture.

Good recipe, this is a keeper.  Changes: I used 1 cucumber, and 1 tbsp. olive oil, 1 tsp. dried dill, and chopped it all by hand.  Good stuff!

Stands up pretty well against the sauce at the really great Greek joint in town here.  I used Greek style plain yogurt and the consistency was pretty thick in the end.  I also did NOT use a food processor, was very easy to make without it, shredded the cucumber, and this would be a good time to remove some excess water (from the cucumber) if you are worried about thickness.  Will be tweaking of course, mine had a little too much lemon so I'll watch out for that next time (and might try using only a little lemon juice and a little vinegar?).  But I will be using this recipe and building on it as my go to Tzatziki.  Great with raw zucchini!

Great and easy sauce! You can try using Greek style yogurt to keep the sauce from getting runny, and to avoid needing to strain it yourself. I also added 1/3 of a white onion, not sure how traditional that is, but it was definitely delicious.

I definately would not use processor.  The best thing to do is partially skin the cucumber then shred it like you would cheese.  I also love this w/ Koriander(cilantro)!

Loved it. Used Greek non-fat plain yogurt and dried minced garlic because I did not have fresh. It's excellent and so refreshing!

Please read reviews first...I wish I did.  The ingredients and flavor of this recipe is worth 4-5 stars however; the directions are worth 1-2.  I decided to split the difference.  First, you have to ring or strain the chopped cucumbers before using them.  Also, the yogurt should also be strained for at least an hour.  I would caution against putting yogurt in a food processor as it breaks it down; especially when combined with lemon juice.  I would think finely chopping the cucumbers and garlic and sticking with a bowl and spoon would be best.  I will make this recipe again because I thinking following the above directions will greatly improve the end result.  I only had about an hour to make this before dinner so I went against my better judgment.  Next time I will allot at least two.

OMG! Loved this sauce! I didn't have my food processor with me so I grated the cucumber into paper towels in a bowl then grated the garlic. At first I was a little taken aback at how much I had made but a couple hours later I went into the kitchen to sneak another taste and there was only about a tablespoon left! My family loved it! (Served it with spinach and chicken pitas w/ red onion and Sangria)

This was okay. I took other raters' advice and used Greek yogurt. I also used dried dill since I couldn't find any fresh. I used cheesecloth to squeeze the water out of the cucumber. It was definitely thick enough, but it wasn't a huge hit in our house. Probably won't be making it again.

A keeper!  This is awesome.  Thanks to several reviewers for suggestions on dealing with the cucumbers.  I read the reviews after I made this and it was runny, but runny and delicious.  I will try your suggestion the next time I make this.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always delicious. We eat it with Greek food and it is also our favorite chip dip. To prevent it getting runny, I grate my cucumber (using a large holed grater) into a tea towel and then squeeze out the water, without having to add extra salt. Delicious!!

As people have been saying, you must drain the yogurt to the proper consistency. If you don't have a cheesecloth a great substitute that I used was a coffee filter.

The taste would have been ok. Blending is a terrible idea, I will shred the cucumbers and mix them in by hand next time.

What the recipe doesn't tell you is that you have to strain the water from the yogurt or you can use sour cream. I used sour cream. I also strained some of the water out of the cucumber. Watch the lemon as it can make the sauce too liquidy. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a tee. It was a soupy mess. I made some adjustments and the recipe tunred out great.

Yummy.  My mother in law always uses just sour cream and cucs.  After seeing this recipe, I now use 1/2 SC and 1/2 yogurt.  And I LOVE the dill in it. I also skip the oil and leave the seeds.  Lazy I guess:)  Great for gyros, grape leaves, naan, anything that has a mediteranian(sp?) or middle eastern flair to it.

After eating at an authentic Greek restaurant in Detroit, I decided that I should find a recipe for tzatziki sauce to make on my own.  This recipe was highly rated, and now I know why...it's delicious!  Although, I must agree with other users in that it's best to strain the yogurt before mixing.  I strained mine with a cheesecloth overnight, but a coffee filter would probably work too.  I didn't use Greek yogurt - just regular plain.  I thought that the amount of garlic was perfect, but I like the garlic flavor.  Caution - this recipe makes about 4 cups of sauce (it was almost too much to fit into my food processor)!!  I had enough to use as a dip for pita bread & carrots for a party, plus plenty left over to spread onto chicken pita sandwiches for lunch all week.  If you don't need that much, I'd suggest cutting it in half.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I can't wait to try the other Greek sauce - skordalia - from this site!

We loved this sauce.  I'm not big on measuring things out - I just eyeball the ingredients until it looks and tastes right.  I only used half of the yogurt, and subsituted the other half with sour cream.  I did drain the yogurt like other reviewers, it would have been much too thin otherwise.  I didn't bother draining the cucumber, but I did make sure they were seeded.  I mixed the yogurt and sour cream in one bowl, and mixed all the other ingredients in the food processor, and then just folded them into the bowl of yogurt.  The texture was perfect.  I also used fresh dill - quite a bit more than is called for since we're big fans of dill.  Great recipe, but don't worry so much about exact ingredients - just add ingredients until it tastes how you like it!

I prefer to not peel my cucumbers, since I put them in a food processor anyway after they have strained and it adds more color to the sauce. I also sometimes add a bit of mayo or sour cream in if it is a tad too liquidy (I know it's not authentic but it does give it extra flavor). The peels in the cucumber help thicken it too.

I've add extra garlic as well.

I make this every other week or so. I love it with everything: as salad dressing, sandwich spread, dip, etc.

I used all there ingredients but I didn't blend it by machine like suggested.  I peeled and removed the seeds of the cucumbers.  Then I grated the cucumber with a box grater.  Then I squeezed out the liquid by putting in a dish towel.  Last I used whole milk Greek yogurt which is thick.  It was a perfect sauce.

I ended up with tzatziki soup, even though I used greek yougurt. I regret not reading the reviews first; NOW I know that it is critical that the cucumber be drained and the yogurt as well, and that it shouldn't be done in a food processor. I will follow a different recipe next time one that has all the steps needed.

I use nonfat greek yogurt and run my cucumbers through the processor separately so that I can strain the extra liquid from the cumcumbers . This makes the sauce creamy and thick.

We love this dip, I've made it a few times and it has never been watery. I use English cucumbers and fage yogurt. Not sure if that makes a difference, but I know you do have to take out the seeds for sure. I always eyeball the measurements and add more to taste, sometimes we can't wait the hour, but the favors do pop if we can. I also just noticed that the recipe calls for putting ingredients in the food processor LOL, I've never done that because we like it chunky. This is close to restaurants we've been to, every restaurant has slight variations, I think you just have to add or take away to get the flavor you want.

We loved this! I did read some suggestions and changed just a bit. First, I did not use a food processor or blender. I just folded everything together. Second, living in Japan I had a difficult time getting my hands on Greek yogurt (as many have suggested) so I went ahead and used the plain yogurt. I ended up adding 2 tablespoons of sour cream to keep it from getting runny. I peeled and seeded the cucumber and shredded it. I drained it as best possible then salted it and put it aside for about an hour. Then drained the remainder of the water. I minced 4 gloves of garlic. I also had a hard time finding fresh dill so I used dried dill (teaspoon). It sat in the refrigerator for about 2 hours before I served it. It was delicious! All of guests enjoyed it and my husband asked if we could put it on our "regular" menu. So it's a plus in this household!

I was excited to try it, bought all ingredients. Followed all directions, even strained cues. I was very disappointed. Will never make this again. And I love the sauce in gyros, thats why I tried it.Don't know what I did wrong.

I don't know why I haven't tried making my own tzatziki before. How stinkin' easy!  I basically halved this, so here are the quantities I used:

1 6 oz container plain Greek yogurt
half of a cucumber, shredded and drained
1 tbsp OO
1/2 lemon
1 clove garlic

I left out the dill, since everyone I've had never seemed to reek of dill (not a huge fan) and I thought it tasted pretty darn good.  I actually think the garlic was a bit pungent (I grated it).  But it is really a great, easy sauce to make.  Used it as the dressing on a Greek salad (using the Greek Chicken Recipe from this site).

I always drain my yogurt for tzatziki, but I also prefer my cucumber and garlic grated instead of diced. I just use a box grater and let the cucumber fall onto a paper towel so the extra water gets soaked up. That being said, tzatziki is my very favorite and I use it for a lot. I love using it as a veggie dip as well!

This was absolutely fantastic!! I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I used 0% Greek Yogurt to make it super healthy..  I served it with Kibbi a Lebanese dish and it was the perfect compliment.  I could definitely see this being a great dip for veggies or a salad dressing, very light and fresh tasting. When my son was leaving for the weekend, he made sure he made off with the rest of it!  I will definitely make this again!  Wonderful.

really good, my friends LOVED it!! i actually doubled the recipe, and used 2 HUGE cucumbers, grated, since i don't have a food processor. 

i then just used some paper towels to soak up the excess water from the cucumbers, and gently mixed all of the ingredients together. and i also used Fage greek yogurt, which adds an amazing thickness and tangy flavor.

This is a great recipe...but,unless you know before hand you have to use Greek yogurt (because it is not as watery as regualr)and make sure you strain it well, it won't turn out restaurant style!. I use a cheese cloth, triple fold it and lay it in the bottom , with enough left to fold over the yogurt later, in a colander which sits over a bowl so the water drips through, stir up the yogurt and place upside down, leaving the container over it in the fridge. Occasionally after several hours I will take off the container and fold the cloth over the yogurt to squeeze out some of the water. I usually do this over 2 days for maximum results. I also peel,seed and dice the cucumber ahead of time, wrap with paper towels, changing them out to absorb some of the water. This first time we used this recipe it was very watery, but with a little practice we finally got it perfect! We really enjoy using this recipe.

using Greek yogurt or hanging your yogurt in a cheese cloth for a day or so would also help with the runniness problem.  American yogurt is much thinner then what the Greeks use.  Any Tzatziki made with plain American yogurt will be inferior to the real thing.

Excellent! As another review suggested I used sour cream in place of yogurt and I couldn't even wait for my chicken souvlaki to come out of the oven.  I started rumaging through my pantry looking for chips & crackers to dip into this yummy super duper dip!

Drained yogurt like other reviewers, great sauce.  Yes it would be great to use greek yogurt and such but in my small town not possible.  I think this sauce turns out great, added to homemade gyros we made.

This recipe is a good base but is missing some crucial steps in the method. To make it as is, is was too runny.  I also changed the ratio of ingredients to suit our taste.  Found the lemon and dill was too overpowering.  I used a 750 ml tub of 2% plain yoghurt.  About 3 cups but you end up with 2 cups after straining. Cut the lemon juice by half use one large cucumber seeded Only 1 tsp of dill I use a cloth to strain the yoghurt because I don't have a sieve that is fine enough  To start I poured the container of   yoghurt onto a 12" square rinsed out piece of cotton cloth - a dinner napkin works well whether it is cotton or nylon. ( I use fabric softener in the laundry so need to rinse the aroma off the fabric first so it doesn't transfer into the food) I use an elastic band they use to tie up produce like broccoli.  Pull the 4 corners of the cloth together & tie up with the elastic and then hang off the knobs or hinge from the kitchen cupboard and drain into a bowl.  You can squeeze it yourself if you don't want to wait, goes fast too. then hang it, after 30 minutes you should have approx 1 cup liquid in the bowl below and a thicker yoghurt  Its messy getting the yoghurt off the cloth but worth it. During that time you can get the rest of the stuff together. Cut the cuke longwise and use a spoon to scoop the seeds. Grate the cuke with a medium grater put the cuke in a sieve and squish the water out with your fist or spoon.   Gets the liquid out fast. Then added the rest. Thi

For someone not used to using yogurt I had no idea you were supposed to drain it first.  This came out terribly thin and I have no idea if we're going to be able to use it now.  Good taste though, haha.

good recipe with a couple adjustments because it would end up much too runny if followed exactly. i drained yogurt and lightly salted/drained shredded cucumbers... both overnight over colanders- resulted in a very thick, lucious sauce! served with garlic pita chips and they were wonderful!

I followed other reviewer's advice and used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream.  I forgot to bring my food processor ( I made at my sisetr's) so I chopped everything finely and we used it immediately. My brother-in-law and my husband liked the "chunky" texture.  It started out nice and thick however it then turned runny(but still very good) I am going to keep this recipe and this time make a trip to the speciality market for good greek yougurt and give that a try.  No matter still a keeper.

Very Good!  Made with the Souvlaki recipe from this site, and served with warm pita bread and a Greek Salad.  It was a wonderful dinner.  The sauce was very flavorful.  I did drain the yogurt through cheesecloth, and salted/drained the diced cucumbers.  I then processed everything in a blender before folding in the yogurt.  It turned out with just the right texture.

This was a good recipe except I didn't understand the need for the food processor. The consistancy is better if made by hand.  I also drained both the grated cucumber and the yoghurt to make for a thicker dip.

I've been making this for nearly 40 years ever since I lived in Europe and I have usually used sour cream while in the USA because American yogurt is to runny; but now most stores sell authentic Greek yogurt - FACE, as well as an American brand version of Greek Yogurt.  I use the FACE because it is a product of Greece.

I also forgot to read the reviews and ended up with a very runny version, which was actually a perfect salad dressing!  I'll keep this as two recipes now, drained for sauce and not drained for salads.

The flavor of this sauce was great!!  Unfortunately, the night I made it, I forgot to read over the reviews, and I forgot to either drain the yogurt or add it last...the sauce ended up very thin and runny, but the flavor was so good that it didn't make any difference to me (other than it didn't 'stick' to my souvlaki well enough)  I will definitely make this again and try adding the yogurt at the end.

I cut this down considerably for 2 and it was still very good. I drained the yogurt and cucumbers as so many others suggested. I used 2 cups drained nf yogurt, and simply mixed in garlic powder, dill, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. I will be making this often. Thanks!

after having tzatziki and gyro and the mad greek (on the way to vegas, you must stop at this place), i wanted to make this awesome sauce at home.


i bought some greek full fat yogurt at trader joes. i think it was total or fage?

it was good but almost, just almost what i was looking for. i did only use one garlic and i only had a lime not a lemon so i used that. i also used dill weed from a container.

i will definitely try this again but this time i will use the 3 garlics per recipe, lemon instead of lime and fresh dill weed.

Great! Tasted just like the one used in our local Mediterranean restaurant. I shredded and drained the cucumber first (I think I only used 1 cucumber), and drained the yogurt for an hour too. Delicious.

This was quite good.  I used Greek yogurt and it was still a bit on the "thin" side.  It was very tasty though!  I'm a garlic fiend and I even added extra garlic.  Very good.  I'll make this again.

Tasty recipe if you make sure to strain the yogurt (even if it is full-fat). I used balkan yogurt. I did not read the reviews before making it....so when it became runny from the food processor, I just strained it through some cheesecloth and it was perfect! Great served with garlicky pita or veggies!

Not sure if this is very authentic, but it is a very fast and tasty recipe!

I thought it might be a little watery since the yogurt wasn't getting drained. I peeled and sliced the cucumber, salted them, then squeezed out the excess water before finely dicing it and throwing it into the yogurt. I also used dry dill. The flavor and consistency came out great!

Super yummy! I feel like I just discovered an acient Greek treasure. This is so flavorful. I grated the cucumber like some other recipes called for. I like the texture that way. I used parsley instead of mint, because that is what I had. Wow! I want to put this on everything!

If you use whole milk Greek yogurt you don't have to strain it. (New studies show that not only is the fat in whole milk products not bad for you, they contain Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), more Omega-3, etc. which aid in reducing cancer, diabetes and more). I don't use a blender or a food processor.  I hand grate English cukes ,then drain them and press between paper towel, which is where all the water comes from. I stir the ingredients by hand and Voila! Even the   the next day, leftovers are still rich and creamy.

Not impressed for same reason as most people since it was so runny. Like the idea of not putting yogurt in food processor yet I would still be concerned about it getting mixed well enough with other ingredients.

This recipe was delicious as far as the ingredients are involved. I used plain Greek yogurt. Next time I will process all the ingredients except for the yogurt and fold that in at the end. The food processor broke down the yogurt so it turned out watery.

Tzatziki too watery? You looked quickly at the recipe without reading the critical reviews cautioning you to drain the yogurt and the cucumber first..no problem, mate. I am a canner and have a product necessary for producing perfect jels and canned products from my produce--two types of clear jel: instant, which you add to uncooked products, as in the tzatziki, and regular which is added to cooked foods. Clear jel acts like cornstarch, or arrowroot without an aftertaste and is perfect for the too watery oops moment. I purchase mine from www.barryfarms.com. Pectin is similar but used in jams, preserves as it binds to sugar. You'll like clear jel for its many applications of fixing cooking mishaps.

I make this and use it to eat with baked or pan fried chicken breast. It's a great replacement for gravy and if you use greek seasonings on the chicken, it's even better. I mix by hand and the cucumber should be trimmed away from the seeds.

I blended up the cucumber and garlic together in a baby food processor. Then I strained it and squished all the water out. I added this strained pulp to the rest of the ingredients. It wasn't runny and tasted so good with the "Easiest Falafel Recipe" with greens on naan bread. Restaurant quality taste!

When I did this recipe as posted it was very watery. This time I did it w 17.6 ounces of Greek plain yogurt with one cucumber and I didn't put it in a blender I mixed it by hand, I eyeballs the rest of the ingredients and it came out perfectly. I think bc the cucumber has so much water in it the blender bought it out and made the sauce runny. Doing it my way it was perfect!!!

I made this using only one cucumber, 2 small 5oz containers of Greek vanilla yogurt, 2cloves garlic Abt a tablespoon of lemon juice, half tablespoon of dried dill, and a pinch of salt and pepper. It tastes really good with chicken (I use it for wraps or as sauce to pour over chicken and rice bowls). If you want this sauce to be thick you need to chop the cucumber into little pieces, use a garlic press and fold the ingredients together by hand like one of th other reviewers mentioned. Dont put the yogurt in a food processor. It tastes better the longer you let it sit.

Wonderful!  I used FF sour cream instead of greek yogurt - drained it in cheesecloth for about an hour. Finely shredded the cucumbers and let them drain (no salt) over paper towels for about an hour too, occasionally squeezing them in the paper towels and replacing the towels with dry ones. The whole house smelled of cucumbers for quite awhile afterwards. 2 days later it's still not runny.  Don't skimp on the garlic!

Greek yogurt works the best, i then thin it out with sour cream, I seed and dice my cucumbers and put the garlic thru a press, fresh cracked black pepper and some salt, occasionally I add finely diced red onion as well  to give it a nice bite as well. Recommend  you fold it in by hand.

I mixed up all the ingredients EXCEPT the yogurt and blended them well, then folded them into the yogurt (like one very useful Review at the top suggested). Initially it was a little runny, but it thickened up nicely after refrigerating for an hour plus. Very Delicious! I will make again, and again!

The taste was okay, but blending the cucumber in a food processor gave the sauce a really gross chunky texture. I also don't know why the recipe calls for dicing the cucumber and then says to process it in a food processor. I would not make this recipe again. The ones with shredded cucumber are much better.

slight tweak to a great recipe.
I used two 6 oz fage greek yougurt. recipe called for 2- 8 oz. unspecified plain yogurt.
one English cucumber, seeded (NOT peeled)grated on coarse microplane grater. press cucumber between two paper towels to rid of excess water. 3 lg cloves garlic shredded on fine microplane grater. will make  a garlic paste, microplane is much better than a garlic press and easier to clean the grater than those pesky presses. rest of recipe as written, folded ingredients together. I used  more dill 3 T.
I would never use a food processor on this recipe.
the unpeeled (thin skinned english cucumbers) added extra cucumber flavor and slight crunch. I would only use the English cucumbers unpeeled. they are shrink wrapped and do not have that weird waxy coating regular cucumbers have. worth the somewhat higher cost, and IMO essential for this recipe.
this is the best tzatziki sauce I have made. it is going permanently in my recipe box.
quite agree, you must use greek yogurt for this recipe. I did not drain yogurt and the sauce was a perfect stiff consistency.

Made this recipe as directed the first time and did not like it! Went back at it again with some changes the second time around. Used sour cream instead of yogurt as I prefer the flavor and texture of the sour cream. Doubled the cucumbers called for , salted and strained them overnight in a colander to get rid of the excess water. Used the measurements above for the other ingredients (added extra garlic too). Mixed the sour cream, dill, olive oil, lemon juice , garlic and pepper in a bowl with a spatula and after well mixed , folded in the cucumbers last.  Chilled and enjoyed over several days with pita, chicken , crackers and anything else we could find to put it on or dip into it  !  Thanks for giving a jumping off point for a great sauce

I pretty much agree with Paula Wood.  I just finished making a batch of tzatziki sauce and put it in the frig for a rest.  Luckily I already knew 2 steps this recipe leaves out.  I don't know about adding salt to the grated cucumbers, I don't, but after I grate them, I place them on a fine strainer and press out all the liquid I possibly can.  Second, you don't have to drain the yogert if you buy Greek yogert.  Greek yogert doesn't have all that water in it.  Otherwise for THIS recipe you need 2 16oz. containers of regular Dannon type yogert, put it in a sieve and let it drain for a couple of hrs.  You will wind up with around half of what you started with.  Then follow the recipe.  I always add more garlic.  This sauce is also great on baked potatoes instead of sour cream.  Incidently, this sauce tastes just like what I get in Tarpon Springs. Tapron Springs, Fla. is a VERY Greek (at least half the residents speak Greek) sponge fishing port so if it tastes like theirs it must be pretty authentic. Just my opinion.

For those who followed the recipe like I did and ended-up with cold soup, do not throw it out. Here is rescue 101:
1. Make a slurry with small amount of the runny tzatziki and 3 tbls corn starch. 
2. Add slurry to the rest of the tzatziki and slowly bring to a boil over medium heat while constantly whisking. 
3.You will see the tzatziki start to thicken - remove from heat at desired consistency and refrigerate. 
4. Never use this recipe again.

*Note - the Tzatziki will not be restaurant quality, but it is passable and a quick rescue solution for your Tzatziki soup.

I, too, had an issue with this coming out runny. I will definitely strain the yogurt next time.

So tasty! But if you (like me) were in a hurry and didn't read the reviews BEFORE you made this sauce, you also ended up with a delicious, but very runny, sauce. Here's your bail: line a large strainer with a paper towel or coffee filter, pour the tzatziki in and let it drain until it's the consistency you want. Maybe not the best way of doing things, but better than tossing it! I would give it 5 stars if the recipe included the information about draining the yogurt and the cucumbers. I will eat it on everything I can dip in it!

This recipe is very tasty. I was able to thicken this sauce by first straining the yogurt through cheese cloth (2 hrs. at least). I also did the same with the cucumbers after turning them into a paste with a food processor. For 2 cucumbers strained through cheese cloth, about 16 oz. of liquid was removed! 

Save the liquid for juice drinks or freeze into ice cubes & add to a glass of water for a refreshing summer drink!

I've also added feta cheese to the blended Tzatziki as a variation. Also thickens it, adds more flavor and of course more calories & salt. Yummy!

Mine came out water-thin and unusable. I double checked to make sure I had gotten everything right, but I can't find where I could have gone wrong. Will start with Greek yogurt and a different recipe next time, but for tonight I will have to make other dinner plans.

So good. I use dried dill and it still comes out delicious. You can use it as a dressing too for a simple salad of cucumber, orange bell, lettuce etc.

This is so much better with Greek yogurt. You can make your own with regular plain yogurt by lining a funnel or (using a cone coffee funnel) with a coffee filter, adding plain yogurt and let sit overnight in "frig..it will be a little less than 16 oz, but will still work in this recipe. Great for toasted pita dip!

To keep this from being runny you need to let the yogurt drain. I used Greek yogurt, put it in a collander and let the liquid drain out. Also, drain your cucumber well, chop it and place into a dishtowel and squeeze the liquid out. Then you can mix it and put it in the fridge. I like to do mine the night before, it gives it a lot of time to settle and permeate the yogurt.

We thought this sauce was very tasty, although it was thinner than my DD remembered having it on restaurant made gyros. I think the thicker ones don't have cucumbers in the ingredients. I served it on pork souvlaki in a pita. The tzatziki sauce really enhanced the pork to make a keeper of a recipe! Thanks for posting!

An excellent sauce!  I followed some of the advice & drained the yogurt for several hours before adding the other ingredients, and chopped the cucumbers with a  hand chopper instead of putting them in a food processor.  Very, very good & I'd most definitely make it again!

Very good.  As others say, I recommend Greek yogurt and it won't be runny.  Also, salt and let the cucumbers drain after you dice them.

great recipe...tastes amazing on falafel pitasand veggie burgers.  I also drained the yogurt and cucumbers over night.  Good tip: use greek yogurt if you don't want to drain it: it is much thicker than regular yogurt.  I didn't use a blender either; use a food processor to chop all ingredients than mix together gently.  I also cut some of the tartness by adding a tiny bit of honey (about 1/2 tsp). This is a really yummy dip.

This is delicious, but trust me do not put it in the blender or food processor. I made that mistake the first time, simply cut the cucumber very finely and mix all of the ingredients together. You won't regret it

I, too, wish I had read the reviews, and like a previous poster had mentioned, the taste was amazing - however, it came out very thin and almost runny, not at all like tzatziki should be. It was certainly edible and we enjoyed it immensely, but next time I will try the recommended trick of straining the yogurt and removing most of the water from the cucumbers. :)

Very good. Cut the recipe in half and just stirred instead of mixing in the blender. Did not drain the yogurt ahead of time and had no problem with runny-ness.

I loved this, great base! My mom made this for me, she blends everything up then strains it in a coffee filter to get a rich .. thick.. delishous taziki. mmmm. SOOO GOOD!.  I only use one container of yogurt and 1 cucumber, keep everything else the same and this is a incredible recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us!

This was great! I halved the recipe, and it still made a TON of sauce. Next time, I might put in more garlic, or maybe even garlic powder in addition to the garlic cloves since I don't feel the garlic taste was potent enough. I let it chill overnight and served it the next day on "Turkish hamburgers"--beef browned in a pan with chopped up onions, served on wheat pita bread with diced tomatoes, pickles, and, of course, generous dollops of tzatziki sauce. Yummy!  I also used this sauce as a base for a dill-mustard sauce over salmon since most of the ingredients were the same. See "Quick Poached Salmon with Dill Mustard Sauce" recipe on this site for actual recipe.

I did not need this much, so I used 1/2 the amount of yogurt, only 1 cucmber and 1 TBS of olive oil.  I did not have dill, so I added fresh oregano instead. I chopped the cucumbers by hand and decided they weren't small enough after everything was mixed so I threw everything in the processor. It was not runny at all, but I think the yogurt is why. I bought Greek yogurt that had already been strained. This tasted better than a few Greek restaurants I have been to!

I follow a recipe found in NYT. They called it cucumber salad. Drain 2 cups whole milk yogurt. I use a coffee filter and strainer. Grate three persian pickles and place over strainer and cover with salt for about one hour. Rinse and combine with 1/2 cup walnuts, 2 tbsp olive oil and two garlic cloves. Refrigerate for several hours. I found this to be pretty tasty.

This is excellent.  I took the advice of another review and drained my yogurt overnight in cheesecloth.  I put all ingredients in my food processor and just pulsed it a few times to keep the cucumber a little chunky.  I used fat free yogurt and think it would be better with a LF or regular yogurt.  I think next time I'll try the greek yogurt as someone else recommended.

I followed recipe exactly, and thought it was good, but missing something.  I saw another another recipes on this site that added white vinegar, so I added just a little of that and mixed in some sour cream.  I will be making this again, with those two additions.

Love this recipe!  Use Greek Non-Fat Yogurt and you can get all the flavor and count it as a protein rather than a fat.

I use 1-2 cloves of garlic (3 cloves is a bit too strong after it sits overnight).  I also shred the unpeeled cucumbers to give the sauce more texture (rather than pureeing them with the other ingredients).

Yeah! Ever since having this sauce at our favorite local Greek restaurant, I have wanted to recreate it at home. I used this actually as a dressing for a cucumber-tomato salad, so the thin consistency was perfect, but I would definitely draing the cukes if you're wanting to use it for a dip. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this sauce to serve with falafil. I started the yogurt and shredded cucumber draining last night in the fridge using a coffee filter for each. The yogurt was a beautiful consistency but the cucumber remained watery, even after all night sitting. Next time I will try salting it. I only made a half recipe, but forgot to half the lemon.oops. I was able to tone the LEMON flavor a little by adding fresh pepper, sea salt and more olive oil. Ahhhh, lesson learned. overall, good recipe.

I used every ingredient in this recipe.  I did NOT put it in the food processor.  I drained my yogurt for several hours.
Peeled, seeded, drained, shredded my cukes.
Added the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, chopped dill.
It was FANTASTIC!  It could have used more salt to taste, but was exactly the sauce that I was looking for.  Thick and creamy!

This recipe is phenomenal.  So easy and it tastes just right!  I made sure to drain the yogurt and cucumber first, and I added all the other ingredients to the blender before adding the yogurt just long enough to get everything mixed properly.

If you get that craving for Greek food, this will be a recipe you go back to again and again.

Very runny.  I wish I had read the reviews before making.  I'll try it again and this time I'll strain the yoghurt & cucumbers.  Good flavor though.

I followed the advice posted in some of the reviews and drained the yogourt, grated, salted and dried the cukes on paper towels in the fridge overnight.  Skipped the blender and just folded everything in.  Turned out nice and thick and wonderful!  Have made this multiple times and it's a huge hit with friends and coworkers.

My boyfriend and I really liked this sauce.  It did get runny (probably from using a food processor and lowfat yogurt), but we fixed that by adding a few tablespoons of sour cream and chilling it in the freezer.  It went great with the Gyro Burgers. Yummy.

I used real greek yogurt instead of regular and it makes a world of difference!  If you can find this in your grocery store it's worth the extra cost and effort.  Excellent recipe otherwise.  Everyone loved it with the Souvlaki recipe from this site.  It's a keeper!  Thank you.

I strained the yogurt and even pressed excess water out of the cucumber.  The consistency came out perfect, but the taste was much too bland.  I think this was because I used low fat yogurt.  I'll try this one again using full fat yogurt.

This was pretty good. I added a little bit of sweet onion to blend in with the mix. I halved the recipe and it still made a lot. I didn't quite have enough yogurt, so about 1/4 cup of it was sour cream. I may have added too much dill and black pepper, but that is my fault not the recipes!

My favorite dip! I personally use vinegar instead of lemon juice, I think it tastes better, and that's how Greeks make tzatziki.

i was so torn over how many stars to give this and i finally settled on 4 -- here's why: had i not read the reviews, i might have ended up with a really liquidy mess. i strained the yogurt and salted the cucumbers for about half an hour - i was admittedly in a hurry, and i'm sure it would have been even thicker if i had left the yogurt to drain even longer. i also added some mayo (also per another review)and mint, and used juice from the whole lemon, and added a bit more dill -- put all in the blender and processed. in the end, the dip was thick enough for veggies or chips or pita or anything else. tastes great, both cool and spicy. with modification, this is a great side (plus, with fat free yogurt and mayo, it's almost guilt free).

This recipe is really good but I can definitely see how people can find it too runny.  To curb that I tend to dry the cucumber with paper towels after letting them drain, and I also use a lot less yogurt than the recipe calls for (about 1/2 cup)

Sorry but yuk!
Glad I halved the recipe 
Terrible aftertaste from the Greek Yogurt and overall wasn't much for flavor, well except the aftertaste.
If your into Greek Yogurt this might be the recipe for you, if not I don't recommend it.

This recipe tastes great; I especially like how it uses lemon juice in place of vinegar, which gives it a fresher taste in my opinion. I've made it several times now, and it's always a big hit!
But I did follow some tips from other reviewers, and I always make the following changes: I either use Greek yogurt or drain the regular yoghurt over night, grate the cucumber (better texture), and just blended it all together in a bowl instead of a food processor (I obviously have to mince the garlic by hand). So I give the taste a 5/5, but knock off a star because the method provided yields a runny result.

Delicious.  However, I added mint which we like.  The finished dressing was a bit watery as the directions do not include squeezing the water from the cucumbers.  Otherwise, love it!

It came out too runny. I believe it had too much cucumber which I believe mad it watery. I made another batch with half a cucumber that was better but still a little runny. Maybe seeding is the key.

I used a 24oz container of plain Greek yogurt and an entire English cucumber.
I am going to cut back a lot on the garlic next time I make this, I cannot handle very much raw garlic and it got a little overpowering in some bites.

I strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a 30-60 minutes and salted the cucumber and let it sit for the same amount of time and tried to squeeze off as much of the water from that as possible. After mixing it all together I let it strain through cheesecloth AGAIN for another 30-60 minutes and then mixed back in some of the liquid to get it to the consistency I was looking for.

Instead of taking the time to drain the cucumbers, I peeled,seeded and chopped in the food processor.  I then squeezed them dry in a clean cotton dish cloth.  Saved a lot of time and removed the liquid.  No need to strain the yogurt, just stir into other ingredients that were pulsed together  in the food processor

I basically followed the recipe (dry dill) and I was impressed. I did mix the garlic and yogurt the night before to mellow the garlic. The rest I prepped  a few hours before gyro time. I did take the step of salting, seeding, and squeezing out the cucumbers.

Flavor is outstanding... but  if you follow this recipe you will get a salad dressing not a true sauce. Says sit for an hour... it’s been sitting for 3 and it isn’t thicking up. I have no way to strain it either. I would suggest finding a different recipe unless you want a dressing.

I made mine with Plain Greek Yogurt & Plain Kefir combined, no draining.  I didn't have cucumbers so I made this first batch without.

It is delicious!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I peeled and seeded one large English cuke, gently processed it, put it in a sieve and pressed out the water with a spoon.
Added about  1/4 cup onion.
Then added the other ingrediants.
That's all I changed and this recipe got raves.

Actually, a majority of the water comes from the cucumber, since they're approximately 96% water. To solve this problem (and the only reason good tzatziki takes any time at all) is to toss them in salt after they are diced, and set them in a sieve or similar utensil over a container, uncovered for an hour or more. This will draw out a great majority of the moisture.

Made as directed but used huge garlic cloves and it was a bit too garlicky (which is hard to do IMO). I might keep it to smaller clones next time. Just came back from Greece and this rivaled anything I had there. Also blended by hand.

We made a half recipe which was ample for our meal. We omitted the oil but followed other steps. Super tasty but a bit runny. Excellent dressing for a romaine salad with leftover/cooled falafel.

I folded ingredients into Greek yogurt and it turned out real nice.  Then I added a little fresh mint which made it even better.

Served this with another recipe I found on this site, Kofta Kabobs which were made with lamb. Very good! I followed other reviewers suggestions to avoid a runny sauce and drained both the lowfat yogurt and the cucumbers for a few hours before I made the sauce. After doing those two things the consistency seemed perfect to me. Will probably make this in the future as just a veggie dip too!

Good flavor. As others mentioned, it was too runny. I hadn't read the reviews in advance but I was able to strain it through a fine mesh strainer at the end. That solved the problem.

3.7.18  I used Greek yogurt which is thicker, so I had no problems with runny sauce.  This was delicious on American Gyro, a recipe also on this site.

This is an easy and tasty tzatziki! The only negative is the step missing when you should drain the shredded cucumber, this will help those who had a thin and runny sauce. I shredded the cucumber, drained in a sieve for an hour, then folded in the other ingredients. It was nice and thick, served over gyro burgers, I scaled to 1 serving and it was enough for us.

You gotta read the reviews, I dont want to waste my time and effort unless I can make it the best I can! This is one of those recipes, I want my sauce thick not runny so adjust accordingly! I processed everything except the yogurt, make sure you de-seed the cucumbers and press out the juice! Perfect ...... just the right consistency ........ All those reviews are worth the time, thanks all!

Guess I'm a little picky, spent two years stationed on the island of Crete. Expectations a bit high. The yogurt was a bit to watery for my taste, should have strained or a different brand. More garlic for sure. Still a good foundation.

I made it as directed and as others have noted it is very runny this way. For next time, I will strain the yogurt and not put it in the food processor. Also i've seen in other recipes where the cucumber is pressed with a paper towel to remove excess moisture - I will process the cucumber first - then dry it with paper towels. Garlic - switch to garlic powder- 1.5 tsp. Salt & Pepper 1/2 tsp ea.

I made it and it was great. I didn't put the yogart in the food processor and didn't add dill. We love the way it came out. We like it soft. Had stirred the contents from food processor into the yogurt.

I made this..but, having worked in a greek kitchen many years ago, The cucumber needs to be seeded. Then it is best to grate the cucumber on the bias so skin and cuke are being grated together. Then a cheesecloth or in a pinch, paper towel..to squeeze out some of the juice. Don't worry the flavour of fresh cukes will remain. then...continue to the processor

Wish I had read the other reviews first...this was a watery, soupy  MESS.....the flavor profile was good and I even used greek yogurt but didn't salt/dewater the cuke or drain the yogurt.  The recipe would work if these steps were included.

I actually make this the way my mother in law taught me which is to drain your yogurt overnight hanging in a tea towel. Sounds crazy but it is so much better. Also she taught me to squeeze just with my hands all the excess juice from the cucumber and we never put dill but everything else yes and you don't need a blender just mix with your hands and season to your taste. Perfect can't go wrong simple

The sauce was extremely runny .  Also, instead of pulsing it in a blender, I would grate the cucumber  (personal taste, I guess).  The yogurt should be drained in cheesecloth and make sure the cuke is dry as possible.
  Luckily I made on half the recipe.  Now what to do with what I have.  It taste ok, just runny (like liquid).

I've made this several times over the years and feel there's one important thing that I've not seen stated. Use "Greek Yogurt", not "Greek Style Yogurt". Greek "style" is just regular yogurt with a thickener added. Use the real stuff. And shred and then drain/press the cuke. And yeah, don't use a food processor to mix. You'll destroy the consistency.

It's a pretty good recipe although I skipped the garlic and dill. I find garlic over powers the beautiful simplicity of flavors in the yogurt and cucumbers and never been a big fan of dill. The other reason people may find this recipe turns out watery, even with real Greek yogurt, is you also need to drain the cucumbers which have a lot of water in them. My husband, who is both Greek and a professional chef, lays the seeded cucumbers on paper towels for 30 minutes or so before dicing or putting in a food processor!

The actual sauce is very tasty, but INCREDIBLY runny. I had to add extra dill and quite a bit more garlic (we LOVE garlic in my family), but ultimately I should've read the reviews first before making. I will definitely be following advice of others next time  I attempt this.

The sauce was very runny. I didn't read any of the comments so I didn't know to drain the yogurt first. I'll have to do that next time. I also added a little more garlic since we like ours with a stronger flavor.

It was really good! I did add a bit of fresh mint to it and it was even better the next day. I had it with my gyros, but I've also been putting it on everything else! It's a really refreshing sauce.

First, I don't have a food processor. I can do a nice mince by hand, though. 
Second, through my own mistakes I made a half batch (with one cucumber and eight ounces Greek yogurt ) that had two cloves of garlic and the rest of the ingredients  in full.
Three, after mincing the cucumber I put it in a paper towel and dried it off as much as possible. 
Served it at a dinner party with a skirt steak and it was a hit! In truth, I may change it slightly in the future to make it more my recipe, but I'll definitely make it again.

I needed Tzatziki sauce for a dish and had on hand and no time to make a special trip to the store for it.  With no yogurt or fresh dill, I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and dill pickle relish for the dill.  I blended it all together and adjusted the ingredients to taste.  It turned out just right!

My husband and son, who consider themselves gyro experts, loved this recipe.   I used plain Greek yogurt because that's all I had in the house.  I also used English cucumbers, again because I had them in the house.  Very yummy dish.

It came out delicious!!! I had it as a dipping sauce for chicken kabobs. It was so good, thank God I bought the big container of Greek yogurt because it came in handy when I had to do a second batch in the middle of the party.

Oh how I wish I read the reviews beforehand. My grocer was out of plain yogurt of any kind, otherwise I would've bought Greek yogurt. I live in Japan and bought a Japanese brand plain yogurt at a different store. I followed the recipe and like others stated, it was so very runny. I've never made tzatziki sauce before but have eaten it, so it was clearly way off and I knew it.  To salvage it, I had to add sour cream to thicken, which threw the flavor off to...well a tad sour of a taste. I counteracted with more dill and once it was done, I put it in a very fine sieve, taking out 1/3 of the liquid.  This helped the texture but I agree that straining beforehand is key.

Also, don't be me and  be lazy, using tube style crushed garlic. If you were thinking that, don't. It added to the runniness and the brand I had was salty. I ended up just adding real garlic at the end.

Stick with the ingredients but strain the yogurt for sure!

Very good!!  I wanted to use this as more of a salad dressing so I added a good couple of tablespoons of half and half, 2 tblspns full fat mayo and some of the cuke juice.  I then tasted and added a bit more fresh lemon juice, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  It is scrumptious and should be good on potatoes, meat and veggies!!

I recently purchased some Tzatziki Sauce at Earthfare in Asheville. It was very good. The ingredients were simple, but they charged over $4.00 for a small container. So I found this recipe and decided to make it myself. 
   I made the sauce this morning and it is in the fridge chilling and marinating at the moment. It is easy to make. You can make it in the morning, and it would be ready for dipping or spreading on a sandwich by lunchtime. 
   I did not use a food processor, simply mixed all the ingredients in a medium to large bowl.  It looks good. I think it might be good on chicken as a baste prior to baking/broiling in the oven.

This is terrible, WAY too much garlic (I used two big cloves, not three). There was no straining step do it was watery, but really it was so inedible that the wateriness was the least of the worries.

This is a delicious sauce. I would caution against using too much garlic as the longer the suace sits the stronger (spicier) the sauce gets. I would also recommend using a spoon to STIR the sauce as both my blender and my food processor over processed my suace and I ended up with a delicious (runny) salad dressing. :)

Made this with a sour cream called "tater top". Comes from US Foods. Make sure to strain shredded cucumbers for awhile. Olive oil, fresh dill, garlic powder(instead of fresh is better for this particular recipe imho)

I made this using fat free Greek yogurt. No need to strain it, it remains thick. I also removed the seeds from the cucumbers before I shredded them. As others have suggested I also salted the shredded cukes for about 15 minutes and squeezed them dry with paper towels. Next time I might add a little more garlic. This stayed fresh in my fridge for 3 days and never got runny. Great with veggies for those on a diet or with pita bread.

I never change the ingredients in this recipe! I have now made this more times then I can count. Fist thing I think of when the cucumbers are coming up in the garden. I use it as dressing for salad as well as the traditional use on gyros.

I love this recipe! however if you follow it exactly the end product is very runny what I do is i use oikos plain Greek yogurt  (it's thicker) and I only put the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and cucumbers in the food processor. then I mix the cucumber mix into the yogurt by hand the product is much thicker this way.

Loved it! And it tasted better the next day! Used Total Greek yogurt like recommend and I drained the cucumbers and squeezed water off with paper towels. I also seasoned it a little more with onion powder and oregano. Great for my first time making, this will be my go to tzatziki sauce.

If you make this with plain Greek yogurt, there is no need to strain- it goes together in minutes and the leftovers ( if you have them) don't get runny! I used 3 - 6 oz containers. Went over great with homemade gyros, and definitely pleased my half-Greek hubby and our full Greek friend!

This sauce is delicious! I halved the recipe (now I wish I had made a full batch because it is so yummy!) One note for a more decadent sauce that will also help with liquid content: find a Middle Eastern store near you and buy a tub of Lebni (it comes in containers that look similar to big yogurt tubs). Lebni is a delicious Middle Eastern condiment made from cultured milk and cream.  It tastes like a blend of sour cream and cream cheese, and has the consistency of yogurt.  Use instead of the yogurt and you will end up with a decadent, thick tzatziki sauce. Enjoy!

I used plain 0% fat, Greek yogurt, no need to drain the yogurt, just stir it.  It lasts a long time, perhaps the lemon preserves it.
I used it for gyros & loved it. I made no changes. I'm going to make it again tomorrow.

This taste amazing. Like many others said, it was a little runny. I haven't made it again, but many others have added suggestions on ways to help with that. 
But even runny, I've used it on multiple dishes. It really got me into Greek-inspired foods! It makes a great dip or spread. It's is VERY garlicy and packs quite a punch. If you aren't as huge of a fan of garlic as I am, I suggest cutting back on that a bit or else you may find it inedible. 
Would definitely make again!

I liked this recipe a lot!  Although next time I will drain the yogurt for a few hours as suggested by someone else.  As is, it would be great as a dressing, but for a dip it does need to be thicker.  Also... I must have added way to much garlic!  :)  Didn't end up using it as a Tzatziki dip because of the runniness and garlic (my bad), but tasted great with chicken!

At first when you're finished preparing it, the sauce does not seem to taste much, but let it rest in the fridge for a couple of hours and whoaaa, definitely a keeper! Btw I used greek yogurt, when after all of it were processed, the end result was not super runny. Just a right consistency of a tzatziki.

One way to extract water from the cucumbers is by salting them before you add the other ingredients.  It was great and I am honestly mad at myself for not making it sooner and spending money on mediocre, at best, sauce.  This was spectacular.

This makes a very good sauce.  Do not put it in a food processor though! I shred the cucumbers (pat them dry after) and crushed the garlic to a paste. I used plain greek yogurt. It is much thicker.  Just fold it all together. You won't be disappointed!

I found it too thin and runny. I believe you need to drain the yogurt. I think I will just buy it already made as it is about the same price as good yogurt.

I  followed the directions and even read the comments about draining the yogurt. While I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce, I didn't like the consistency so I threw it out.  NOTE:  I watched Chef Emeril make it and at no point does he ever put the items in a food processor or blender.  DO NOT use them!  After watching him make it, I went back and did another batch and it was delicious!!  Sharpen those knives and mince your ingredients, then simply blend with yogurt and viola!

Wonderful.  I added extra dill and left out the garlic.  I agree with others that you must drain the yogurt before mixing, and mix gently.  We love it on falafel.

This is a delicious sauce for gyros.  But next time I will cut the recipe in half.  It makes alot.  Make it the day before as it gets better with age.

Love, love, love this recipe.
I make this when I make the homemade Gyros meat.  I also take the cucumber's and drain them in a dish towel.
I have made this recipe around 7 times.  I did not change the recipe.
I also drain the yogurt in a dish towel or cheesecloth when I have it.

Used 2 cups Fage Greek yogurt.  Didn't have fresh dill, so used dried instead.  I couldn't taste the dill, so next time will use fresh.  Also only used 1 tbsp olive oil.   Delicious!  Loved the garlic, not too much at all.

I've made this twice now and it is  fantastic. I used dry dill(1/2T) and pre-chopped garlic(1T). We strain it through coffee filters until it is thick and about half of what we started out with. We liked this a lot more than the Sabra tzatziki sauce.

Used fat free organic Greek yogurt and it remained thick despite not draining the cucumber. I removed the seeds from the English cucumber and grated it. I added part of the cucumber and dill to blender and added rest later. Had a good texture that way.

7/17/16 made it again, this time I squeezed the grated cucumber and left the oil out.  I used fat free Greek yougurt and mixed everything by hand. Delicious and super thick.

I was making a large batch of this for a party, everything tasted great, I even had the ingredients sitting in the fridge overnight, with the exception of the cucumbers which I had draining with salt.  Then I decided to follow the recipe and put the yogurt in a food processor.  Turns out, putting yogurt in a food processor makes yogurt soup.  So now I have 4 packs of pita bread and cucumber soup.

I love Tzatziki sauce and thought I would give this recipe a try.   I prepared exactly as the recipe stated except I did not put the sauce in a food processor because I like a chunky tzatziki.  I also used Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt for a thicker less runny sauce.  The garlic was a little strong for us, so, next time I would reduce the amount of garlic used.  This was perfect with Greek turkey burgers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave it 3 stars because I like it better with Greek yogurt.  Strained cucumber to get all water out. Using Greek yogurt, you don't need to strain it as other people said. I use 2 tablespoons of chopped mint. Only 1 English cucumber, peeled, seeded cut in half and grated. No need to use food processor. Just mix everything and enjoy! Love it with everything!

I used an 11% plain greek yogurt. And strained it all day over cheesecloth. Than made the recipe as it said and still was runny- I think the water in the cucumber waters it down again (I only used 1 cucumber). Once the recipe was finished, I again strained it over cheesecloth over night. Now, I have the perfect sauce :)

My 1st time making this and it tastes wonderful. I added purple onion in the processor with the garlic which gave it that extra kick. But next time I'll stir in the veggies to the yogurt instead of the processor, it did come out quite runny. But delicious just the same.

Tasted good but turned out watery.   I should have used Chef Johns recipe.

This was made with my homemade Greek yogurt which is made with whole milk so sour cream was not missed for me.  As one reviewer suggested the cucumber, garlic and dilled were finely minced and folded in.  But wait, there's something missing; a little too tart for a vegie dip so I added about 1 1/2 tsp. honey.  Dip was used for Butternut Squash Cajun Fries on this site.  Delicious and thanks for the recipe Deb.

Awesome!! Whole family loves it!! Forgot to de-seed the cucumber the first time and the sauce was runny but still good. De-seeded it the next time and it was perfect!! Reminds me of the sauce I get at Greek restaurants.

This recipe is great. It's so easy and delicious on just about anything. Next time you do it, liquefy it in your blender so that it turns out like a dressing. So good. I put it on cornish pasties and it was fantastic.

Sorry, but a waste of ingredients.  The reviews above capture it--covers none of the steps required to make a good sauce.  Way, way too much liquid--need to drain the yogurt, and the cukes, otherwise you end up with something to runny to even be a dip.

I made this and followed many of the suggestions here. Grated the cucumbers then salted and set them said on paper towels to drain. But not long enough. Next time I will salt and place in a strainer earlier. I doubled the garlic...what can I say! I also used full fat "Total" yogurt and I drained it as well. I used a small chopper to buzz all except the yogurt. I used italian parsley as there was no fresh dill. Recently had this at a locally owned Resturant and theirs was more garlicky lemony and more of a spread. They also used parsley. And maybe Kefir instead of plain yogurt. Great first attempt!

As written, this recipe is runny.  I knew it would be, as I'm using it more for a sauce than a thicker dip.  Adding the draining step would "fix" that, but for me, the recipe as written works.  I'd never blended a tzatziki before, but this turned out smooth and tasty for my cuke-texture-sensitive boyfriend.  I can't wait to use this as a dressing for slaw!

Delicious! First try I made it as is, which was pretty good. After reading reviews I made it again and used Greek yogurt, which is an absolute must. Also I chopped, salted and drained the cucumbers for 2 hours. Mixed all the ingredients EXCEPT cucumbers in the food processor, then just stirred the cucumbers in after. This time it was perfect! The first time when I blended the cucumbers the consistency was a little weird. Definitely better after making the changes. Served with Greek chicken, rice and pita. Yum! :)

It has been a while since I have made tzatziki - I bought sour cream instead of yogurt.  I made half the recipe.  It was so yummy!  Thank you.

I made this for a grape leaf wreath I made a few days ago. We had that for lunch and gyros this evening. The Tzadzki sauce went great with both! I did use greek yogurt and just stirred in the ingredients. I did cut the recipe in half. I shreded and salted One cucumber (I have never had this sauce with cubed cucumber and I think shreded was better), I didn't drain it much since I used Greek yogurt from my local Aldi store. I stirred in almost 1/2 juiced lemon, 1tbsp of EVOO, Pepper to taste and garlic powder to taste (saved some time and was grreat!) I had some fresh dill so I used a tbsp. of that as well! It was wonderful. As good or better than any greek or persian restaurant I have ever been to!

This was a great tzatziki sauce, although it lacked these two
ingredients: greek yogurt, and fresh mint leaves! Just use these
two next time and you'll be set to go!!!

Flip the dip with a spatula, it will get rid.of the runminess of the ingredients, no need to drain or whatever. do not blender it with a processor and stuff..  ~A chefs daughter.
ps~ i make my own from home and i add vinegar to it and lemon shavings.

I did not care for this recipe.  I read the reviews about it being runny so I cut the cucumber, salted it, and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I took a few tbs of water out of the bowl the next day.  I used greek yogurt as it is thicker than plain yogurt.  It turned out way too runny.  This recipe gets a a major thumbs down from me.

I tried this recipe and it turned out fantastic! Some of us (like me) get urges to make a recipe that should take hours to prepare, but we don't want to wait! (or we don't have enough time) SO this is what I did. I chopped the cucumber up very fine. (I didn't get rid of the seeds because I like that part, and I don't like to waste) I put it in a paper towel and squeezed out as much water as possible. (I did this step with a new paper towel a few times) then I salted the cucumber and let it sit for about 5 mins. Opened my greek yogurt and drained off the liquid on the top. Mixed in the cucumber and a little minced garlic with just a few splashes of lemon juice. My recipe was fantastic and not runny at all :D thanks for the recipe. I will make this again for sure! ** I skipped the oil because it's just not needed**

I tried the various techniques to make this the right consistency (straining the yogurt, chopping and salting the cucumbers to release the extra moisture). Nothing seemed to help. It was way too cucumbery and nothing like Tzatziki I've eaten elsewhere.

I made this recipe as is, with Greek yogurt...and did not like it. It sure did not like my fave Greek restauant's. Not wanting to give up, I read Mrs Summer's review (thank you!) and made it again with sour cream and love it! Now it is close to the restaurant version I think. Also, I pureed the dukes first alone (after letting them drain a bit) and poured off the excess water, then added the other ingredients ....and then just folded in the sour cream.  The texture is great, wasn't "runny" at all. Thank u to everyone for all the tips, that sure helps a lot!

Great recipe!! Wide open for a couple slight modifications for my family's taste. I used 5 smallish cloves of garlic and 2 or 3 tablespoons of fresh dill.  Plus 2/3 of a cup of sour cream.  I used Balkan style yogurt but will use Greek style next time to cut down on the runniness.  Straining the yogurt is effective but takes too much time.  Cheers from Orillia

I would have gave it 5 stars, but I did not drain the yogurt.  Using the advice above, I chose to just use choboni greek yogurt, but although the taste was great, I didn't get the consistency I wanted.

The only thing I would change and give it a 5th star would be to drain the Yogurt overnight.

I really liked this recipe, the taste of my sauce is pretty accurate. The only problem is that there is no indication of what is assumed as the size of the cucumber. Some cucumbers are 3 times others, I just used common sense (assumed the cucumber here is the small ones).

First try at making this sauce and this tasted great!  I took other suggestions and minced the cucumbers in my food processor and drained them overnight.  I don't have cheesecloth, I used coffee filters and worked just as well.  I also used Greek yogurt and drained that overnight since the cucumbers were draining anyway.  Threw it all in the food processor the next day and was so surprised at how thick the sauce was.  This was a great recipe that I can't wait to make for a potluck or home gathering!  Thanx for sharing.

I tried a non-fat version, using non-fat greek yogurt (which is thick and doesn't need to be drained). I DID salt and drain the cucumbers though, and 3 days later this is still NOT watery! :)    I did not use olive oil. I've seen recipes using cilantro in addition to the dill, which I did. The only thing I don't like about the taste, is that I think there is a touch too much lemon juice. Otherwise, this is delicious, creamy, tangy, and GREAT as a dip for veggies or pita chips. :)  Thanks.

The taste was good but it came out very thin. I followed the directions to a T. I'm not sure what happened but I've had better.

I've never had this before, but I thought it was very good - a great accompaniment to a middle eastern pork recipe I made.  I wish I'd had time to read other peoples suggestions, as the sauce was thinner than I expected.  Next time I will strain the yogurt and stir in the cucumber/spice mixture

Really, REALLY runny... forgot to try the other comments about adding salt to the cucumbers and it turned out like Tzatziki soup! 

Tasty Tzatziki soup, but soup none-the-less! 

Ended up working out well when we drizzled it on veggies!

This is okay, I felt like the cucumber was overwhelming and the flavors were not balanced. I would toy with amounts, probably reducing the garlic, and maybe adding black pepper.

Agree with using a food processor to get smaller pieces of cucumber. Next time we'll probably drain the cukes and the yogurt.

Really tasty! You ain't kiddin' when you say it tastes better after refrigerated, though. Don't try to eat it right away! It is too liquidy!! Anyways, a good recipe - I will save this for a party dip.

Just OK. Drained the yogurt and cukes, so the sauce was not runny. I don't like a strong raw garlic taste; this was WAY too garlicky even after reducing the garlic to 2 cloves.

Very good taste but as others have said, very soupy even after draining the yogurt. Should have drained the cucumbers a bit more. I would suggest cutting up your cucumbers the night before, layer on paper towel or on a wire rack, add a bit of salt and sit in the fridge.

Amazing!  Pure tzatziki perfection!  The only thing that I changed was to drain my yogurt overnight.  I didn't bother with buying coffee filters, since my coffee machine has a reuseable filter.  I simply dumped my yogurt into a pasta strainer with small holes and set that atop a salad bowl in the fridge for a few hours.

My husband doesn't like Greek yogurt so I used low-fat sour cream instead.  Paula was right on the money with draining the yogurt and cucumbers first.  Between the two I drained over 1/2 cup of liquid.  This is great stuff!

Yum yum!  This tzatziki is wonderful even with some minor changes I made.  I used half greek yogurt and half sour cream, left out the dill because I didn't have it and used a full lemon.  It tasted wonderful and I added in crumbled feta cheese to the sauce.  Used it with "Greek Chicken" from this site as well.

I did use the Greek Low Fat Yogurt, strained it and it turned out perfect!  I chopped the cucumbers and used about 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed lemon, but after folding all the ingredients and letting is sit in the refrigerator over night, I felt it needed a little more juice, so I added about another 1/8 of a cup of fresh lemon.  It was REALLY garlicy, which I like, but I might try only 2 cloves of garlic next time and can add more, if I feel it needs it.

I loved this recipe with a couple small changes, I didn't add the olive oil, and I didn't mix it in a food processor. I did drain the yogurt and salted the cucumbers with some garlic salt while they drained. I've dipped everything in this sauce the past few days, SO tasty!

Considering I've never made this or ATE it before, I had to make this according to what my husband says it tastes like. LOL I sorta integrated a couple recipes from here, but this was the one I followed. I didn't use FRESH dill, I used an english cucumber & I sub'd sour cream.  My husband likes it but says it's missing some "tang". We'll figure it out, but this is a good beginning recipe and was excellent on our gyro/steak flatbread sandwiches!

Very good! I added a little extra garlic, and let the sauce sit in the fridge over night. It was delicious! My only complaint was that it was a little runny (I'm sure it was that I put the ingredients into the food processor too long). Thanks for submitting!

This is so tasty!  Yes, drain the yogurt, and use Greek yogurt if you can find it (it's thicker).  Try this with Greek Souzoukaklia from this site, and you'll have a fun Greek meal!

I fully agree with the comment by Paula Woods, you need to drain the Yogurt in a collander for at least 1 hour and also salt and drain the cucumbers.  I first made this without draining and it was tasty, but it was too runny. Draining makes for the perfect consistency.

Nice dip for pita or sauce for Greek/ Arab food.  Easy to prepare.  Make sure to use a good quality plain yogurt and refrigerate before eating so flavors meld.

Follow the hints that others noted: Drain yogurt and cucumbers to keep a thick, creamy sauce/dip. Love this stuff.

Very Good.  I followed other suggestions; drained yogurt, folded together rather than process.  It had a good consitancy.  I did not like it as much the next day though.

This was so good! I put my English cuke thru the food processor and then drained it in a strainer over night. I used Greek yogurt which is so thick to begin with that it didn't need draining. Loved this and thank you!

This is excellent, and best if prepared a day in advance.  Usea Greek yoghurt; don't strain. Oikos is made by Stonyfield and you can find it almost anywhere. Seeding cukes is easy, split lengthwise in half and use a teaspoon to scoop out the eeded middle.  I then process them, squeeze them dry in paper towels, and then salt them and let them sit while I prepare the rest of the sauce.  You can sub 3/4 t. of dried dill weed for the fresh with absolutely no comprimise in taste, I've done it many times with fresh and dried, and I think I prefer the dried, actually.  Do not process the sauce, just mix the ingredients in. Great stuff!

I used only sour cream not the greek yogurt. I also used a English cucumber, no seeds. Turned out great! I don't even like tzatziki sauce but this was very good. No problem with being runny.

Very runny...like the other reviews state(I wish I had read the reviews first), but I added a container full of cream cheese to thicken it up, and it tamed the mega-garlic too. Very tasty.

Love this. Only complaint was that it was a bit runny...will have to try it sometime with the strained greek yogurt as another user suggested. Love the flavour.

If you want sauce, don't follow this recipe. As written, it makes a lovely cucumber/yogurt soup, not a sauce. It's tasty, but very runny and nothing like I expected.

This would rate a 5 star if it had more body to it. It was runny, but the taste was outrageously good. Not only was it great on a cucumber salad, but I tried it as a sauce on Serbian Sevapcici and it was outstanding. Next time I'll try it as a pita bread dip.

Fabulous! If you use the proper  Greek styled yogurt you do not need to strain it. You do have to drain the cucumber though.

I make this when I am in a hurry and want the sauce quick - I omit the olive oil and prefer oregano to the dill. Yumm! Thanks!
