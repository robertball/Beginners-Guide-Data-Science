This is just like the chili I make only I use canned pinto beans (Bush's) and also add cumin and cayenne pepper.  The ground beef is chuck which produces more grease (drained in a colander)but also much more flavor.  I use a cast iron dutch oven and the "fond" made by the browned ground chuck is terrific, once the liquid goes in!  Maybe Jay is a bit too finicky about his chili, jrgh17.  This is good stuff.

Great base for a recipe, but not enough liquid from the ingredients listed. I added a couple of teaspoons of cayenne pepper and a can of tomato sauce. Also substituted ground turkey for the beef. After that, it turned out pretty good!

I did not care for this recipe. For one thing, this needs WAY more liquid. The juice from two cans of diced tomatoes is not nearly enough! I was quite disappointed that there was nothing to dip my bread bowl top into. :( Flavor-wise, this was "OK," but my hubs and I agree that we've had much better. Thanks anyways, jrgh17.

This is just like a recipe that came with a list of recipes from my slow cooker! You do need to modify though, I use 2 cans of the 28 oz Tomatoes and 3 Tbsp of the Chili Powder. I add 1 - 2 Tsp Cumin, a Tbsp of pickle juice, and a pickle. You really can go as wild or as tame as your want adding additional flavors spices etc. Great base chili recipe and it is what I have always use!

This was my first time using my slow cooker and making chilli! I made a few changes just to my personal preference. I only used half a green pepper and half a red pepper, garlic powder instead of cloves, I used one can of sliced mushrooms and I added a small can of tomato paste. It is still currently in the slow cooker but I have tasted a bit and it's already amazing!

This is exactly how my dad taught me 45 yrs ago, minus the peppers. I may try peppers next time.

Tasty easy recipe but made modifications based on others' feedback and also my own taste.
I added a small can of tomato sauce since I had it and other reviewers mentioned that the recipe was dry and had no extra sauce. It turned out nice and saucy as a result. Good for dipping bread in.
I also added a couple teaspoons diced pickled jalape√±os for some kick.
I used dried white kidney beans. I soaked them overnight with a tablespoon baking soda like someone suggested elsewhere on the interwebs. But after 8 hours cooking time the beans still weren't completely done. Some of them were soft but most weren't. Next time I use dried beans I'll try another method of soaking.
Otherwise it was an easy tasty recipe.

Have used this recipe many times now. Since my first try with it I use it as a base recipe and have added different veggies and spices, making notes along the way. Overall has a very good taste and is not too spicy, which is good for the whole family. My 2 year old loves the flavours.

This was a great base for slow-cooked chili and easy enough to modify. Once we got to the last hour in the slow-cooker we tasted it to see how things were progressing. We wound up added more of everything (salt, garlic, chili powder, pepper) plus a healthy splash of hot sauce. Topped it with shredded Gruyere. We will definitely make this again.

My very 1st review. Made this yesterday. I'm not much of a cook so, slow cookers are a GOOD thing. Turned out pretty good. I did add a couple of things not in the original recipe, ie: 1 stalk of celery (chopped coarse) and a small can of tomato sauce as other reviewers stated it might not have enough liquid and just a touch of cayenne. All in all, I enjoyed it, although it doesn't make 10 servings.

I never liked chili much before trying this recipe but it has become a household favorite. My husband has even admitted it's better than his mother's! We enjoy it with cornbread or cheddar bay biscuits.

Made this chili recipe and found it very tasty. The 2 pounds of ground beef was perfect for the amount of beans and the peppers made it perfect. I did top it with sour cream and sharp cheddar...yummy. Thanks for sharing.
