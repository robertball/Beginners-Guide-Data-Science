I made this recipe justa few days ago  the flavor of these biscotti is wonderful however like so many other reviewers I too found that the logs flattened out  so I remade them again last night by editing the recipe and was happy too see that the logs stayed standing  I incresed the flour to 2 cups decresed the butter to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup added 1/2 tsp salt an extra 1/2 tsp ginger and backing powder  and 2 whole eggs

When I baked this recipe, the loaves flattened out and ran into each other. Too much butter?  I continued the best I could, and it really still tastes great.

As  the picture shows, the two rolls do flatten out, but can be cut into "fingers."  This recipe is delicious and was rated "wow" by my Italian cousin-in-law.

These taste great,  but as another reviewer found,  my dough spread out and the "logs" became two giant, flat cookies.  They were too thin to really slice and toast,  but I did the best I could.  They are very tasty,  but they have the consistency of soft cookies,  not the crispy biscotti I was going for.  I might try it again,  and try to compensate in some way. Or,  use the same recipe and just make them into cookies.

Can you substitute ground fennel seed for the liquid anise flavoring?
