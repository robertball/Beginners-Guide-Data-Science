love the recipe--but DO NOT cook in aluminum. Use a cast iron skillet on the grate--or something else. Aluminum toxicity leads to Alzheimer's. I have somehow gotten  aluminum toxicity and it's nasty--hard to get out of the body. Very expensive also. You don't want it. Food picks up the aluminum when it come in contact with it.

This is the first time we've had cooked kale. We were surprised at how much "cooking" transforms this power veg! This is a great dish! Simple and flavorful...what more could you ask for! This will definitely be a repeat in our house!

Be sure to toss in the oil, not just drizzle on

We've been making this weekly since we found the recipe.   Easy for the kids to prep and help with too!

I didn't care for this recipe and my partner said he liked it. I felt like this lacked flavor, if I were to make this again I might add some onion powder or garlic powder.

I used this recipe recently and have to say I was very much impressed. I did not use garlic as I simply forgot to add. We paired this with shrimp and salmon kabobs. Great dinner!

I dislike kale, but am always looking for ways to fix it that will be tasty. I did have to roast it instead of grilling but it came out very well. This was very good -- my husband, son, and I all like it, and I'll make it again.
