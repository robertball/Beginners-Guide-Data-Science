I really like these. I disagree with the other reviews that say the top layer is too thick? I did make this in the 15x10 inch pan called for and believe the chocolate layer is just fine. I didn't think these were too sweet either. I did use a dark chocolate brownie mix. (By the way the recipe calls for a 21 oz brownie mix, which I could not find; most are about 18-19 oz. One of those worked just fine.) I topped my bars with white chocolate peppermint M&Ms as I don't like peppermint candy getting packed in my teeth. That worked very well.

Excellent recipe. Tastes as good as it looks. I also used about half of the glaze mix as others suggested. A thinner layer of the glaze was plenty. I brought some to a party and put the remainder in the freezer for another time. Turns out they are really good frozen too :)

I'm not one for brownie mix, so I made the brownies from scratch using Best Brownies. They turned out delicious, however I think the chocolate topping was too thick. I would recommend maybe using just 6oz of chocolate instead of 12, as it turned out to be like a half inch of chocolate. Between the chocolate, the icing, and the brownies, it was veerryy sweet. Really good and very festive though!

These were very yummy and easy to make. I only used half of the chocolate and butter called for in the final layer as well.  The only thing with doing this was you have to work quick to cover the top completely before the chocolate begins to get hard again.

I made these the other day and let me say they were GREAT! One thing I would say is that to eat them, you need to freeze them. Also, eat them in small pieces. When I ate them when they weren't frozen, the middle was too mushy and it was too much to each in larger sections. After they were frozen, it reminded me of peppermint bark. I would recommend to everyone!

I’ve made this recipe several times and it is as good as it looks. The middle melts in your mouth and it’s a holiday favorite.

Used a 13x9 and made the brownies according to "cake style" directions. I didn't reduce the frosting or glaze amounts at all, even for my smaller surface area/pan size, and it was still perfect.  Everyone loved it.

These taste just like a giant Andes chocolate! So, if you like that, you'll love these..otherwise, not so much!

So it looked beautiful. But it seemed like a lot of steps to create a dessert that's a bit too sweet (which I RARELY say), and kind of difficult to eat. Cool idea, though. I may try again, & edit out some of the sweet.

I followed the advice of cutting the glaze in half and they turned out great.  My Italian mother-in-law used to own a restaurant and I never try to keep up with her as far as cooking goes.  However, I brought these to Christmas dinner and my father-in-law asked me to send the recipe to his wife!

This was a very popular dessert item Christmas Eve and Christmas Day!  The only adjustment I made was not adding the food coloring. I will definitely be making this again.

I used a regular 13  x 9 pan, that made them a little thicker but still great.  I was not in the mood to melt chocolate so I used canned chocolate frosting and thinned it  with just a little milk.  They turned out fantastic.  I also used parchment paper under for easy removal and cutting.   Will do it again.
