4.15.19  What a lovely recipe.  Made this exactly as written, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  The fresh raspberry flavor is delicate and fruity, the texture is silky and spot-on perfect for mousse, and the level of sweetness is just right, not overpowering.  Without question, this is an indulgence in this house, but I wanted to make a special dessert for my husband’s birthday, and this didn’t disappoint.  This is an exquisite dessert  suitable for any special dinner.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
