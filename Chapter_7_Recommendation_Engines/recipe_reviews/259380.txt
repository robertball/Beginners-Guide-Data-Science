I did make some changes including using 3 cans of beans instead of dried, turkey sausage, turkey bacon bits and minced onion.  Did not use flour or butter.  However, the stew was still thick and tasty, and gave us a new dinner dish for the fall and winter.

I, too, used canned cannellini beans. Used 4 cans. Stew was perfect thickness without roux.  Next time I might decrease the allspice a tad and add smoky paprika. I also might cook bacon and sausage separately so can get each done as desired. We tried this on an exceptionally cold early fall night and found it a delightfully filling and tasty meal. Served with salad and crusty sourdough bread.

I was in a hurry, so used canned beans and I had to use ground allspice instead of the berries.  Nonetheless, it was super delicious!

We really enjoyed this stew.  I omitted the tomatoes and used about 1/2 a teaspoon paprika.  I also did not use butter and flour to thicken.  I used corn starch instead.
