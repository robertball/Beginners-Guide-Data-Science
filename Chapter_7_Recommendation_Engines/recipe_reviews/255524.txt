It was easy to make it tastes good but I thought it tasted more lemon ginger than pumpkin I do wish they would have posted how many jars to use and how many cups of chopped pumpkin. My batch made 6 half pints with 4 1/2 cups chopped pumpkin

very easy to do. I added a hint of nutmeg and it tasted even better. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I have never thought of pumpkin jam only pumpkin butter. This is both easy and delicious. I added extra ginger after reading the other review. I used it on pumpkin waffles and loved it. It is a treat not to be overlooked. Thank you for the recipe.
