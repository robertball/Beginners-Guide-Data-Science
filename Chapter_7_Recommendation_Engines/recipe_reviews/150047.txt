We were a bit sceptical, but I had all the ingredients on hand, and an abundance of cucumbers and zucchinis from the garden, so we gave it a try.  The salad was very easy to make and it was delicious!  I did make two minor changes...I peeled the zucchini and I add a bit of mince garlic.  The touch of lemon flavor mixed with the strong taste of the balsamic vinegar are interesting and really very tasty.  We will definitely make this one often but next time we need a double batch because this batch was gone in minutes!

This was definitely an interesting dish. I had all the ingredients, so I gave it a try. If I make it again, I will not steam the zucchini quite as long. I steamed it for just 3 minutes, but would have preferred it a bit crisper. The directions don't say whether to slice it thickly or thinly, so that can definitely affect your outcome. I sliced all the veggies to the same thickness. The balsamic and lemon work very well together.

I substituted red wine vinegar, because I do not like balsamic. It was wonderful! I might try adding a little more lemon next time, to see what happens.

This was pretty good. I didn't cook the zucchini or peel the cucumber, and I cut the balsamic vinegar down to 1/4 cup, but next time I will use 1/8 cup. I also cut the olive oil down to one tablespoon.

It was pretty good but I would probably recommend adding onion to it for a little extra zip.  I think it was a little bland.

I added some chopped tomato and some chopped red onion with extra salt.  Good for something different. Served with Ina Gartens meat loaf.

My daughter thought it was too sour, but liked it better after I added agave and crushed pineapple. My other daughter thought it was pickles.
