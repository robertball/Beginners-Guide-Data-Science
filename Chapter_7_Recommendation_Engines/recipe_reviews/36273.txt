This marinade was delicious.  Only change was that I added some Worsteshire sauce to the mix roughly 2-3 tbls.  You might want to use a bit more of the raspberry jam, the final product only hinted of rasberry.  I pounded chicken breast out thin, stuffed with brie, cooked on grill using the raspberry glaze.  Upon serving a put a bit of fresh chopped mint on chicken.  Talk about flavor....!

I used this marinade with boneless chicken thighs and although they turned out very moist, they werent overly infused with raspberry flavour. I will make it again with some other types of preserves to see if it enhances flavours.

This was a good recipe.  The chicken was moist.  The raspberry flavor was not at all strong and I marinated it for 3+ hours.  I don't know that I'd make it again just because with the preserves you expect something really different and it just ends up turning out a bit citrusy.

This chicken was so yummy and moist. I used apple cider vinegar and added fresh rosemary and WOW so amazing. I made it with coconut rice AWESOME. Thanks for this one.

I thought this was barely average.  It didn't have much flavor (I tried marinating overnight).  It also seemed quite dry.  I won't make it again.  For those who did like it, I did pass a raspberry vinagrette as a sauce, and that seemed to work nicely.

I expected more of a raspberry flavor from this but I was disappointed.  It was a bit on the bland side with just a hint of raspberry.
