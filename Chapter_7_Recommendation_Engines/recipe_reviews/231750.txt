I truly didn't expect to like this recipe but I ended up two servings for lunch!  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and used 5 golf ball sized red potatoes.  I added some nutmeg to the cheese sauce.  I used Krazy Mixed Up Salt (which is basically a blend of salt, pepper and garlic powder) to sprinkle on the potatoes when layering.  I didn't have pimento so I used finely diced red bell pepper.  The small casserole baked for 30 minutes with the foil then about 10 minutes after removal.  I think that the potatoes were overdone and if I make this again I will not precook the potatoes.  Thanks!

Very good!. Made this for dinner tonight. Even my youngest liked it, and she never ever eats spinach. I followed the recipe, but doubled the spinach, added garlic seasoning and nutmeg. Went generous with fresh ground pepper and omitted the salt. It was delicious. Thanks!

This was good but I'm stuck with a weird amount of ingredients to use up on something else. I used one each 24 oz bags of small red potatoes and small white potatoes.  I actually measured them out in "cups" and used 25 in total. I don't think the combination of potatoes added anything to this dish and would use whatever I had on hand. Also I thought there was too much sauce and should have just used both bags of potatoes as now I'm left with about 5-7 potatoes of each. Not sure the pimentos added anything and now I'm stuck with the rest of the jar since the serving was so small. The scallions equal one whole scallion. And now I have the "rest of the bunch". Ditto on the spinach. This is a small casserole. If I make it again, I would up all the ingredients.

Unlike most people, I made this recipe as stated. It is excellent! If you want to change this an that or add whatever then submit your own recipe instead of rating something that you never made

Made this for dinner tonight.  Huge hit with my family...even my spinach-hating husband.  I didn't have pimentos but it turned out beautifully without them.  Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe.  A definite keeper!

This meal was a great hit. I used a few different things since this was helping use leftover Easter dinner. I replaced the pimentos with a red pepper, used shallot and a touch of garlic as well. The red pepper against the spinach was very colorful and added sweetness to the meal. Combined with a mixture of mashed red and sweet potatoes, it made a good foundation for the casserole. Final substitution was ham for bacon, still a great flavorful combination.

Ratios seemed off. Too greasy. Spinach didn't do this dish any favors.

Substituted velveeta for the  cheddar and chopped sweet peppers  (rather than pimento peppers) and sauteed the with the onion.  Pre-sliced the potatoes and par-boiled them which reduced baking time to 30 minutes.  Well liked at the potluck.

So far this is the best au gratin potatoes I have made!  When you are adding the sauce it seems like too much, like it will be too soupy, but it thickens up nicely and turns into a nice thick potatoes au gratin.  Loved the spinach in this too!  Oh forgot to mention I realized a little too late that I was out of pimentos, so I roasted up a red pepper to substitute.  Delicious!

1 out of 3 like it at my home. Hubby said it was alright. I felt it was bland and my 12 old grandson just didn't care for it. And Yes, I followed the recipe to the letter!

Followed this minus the pimento and doubled the bacon. Next time I will double the sauce. Seemed a bit dry. Still went over well and my peeps were up for seconds.

This dish has immediately made it to my list of absolute favorites. We are living abroad without any measuring implements, so I just eyeballed everything and it was fabulous. I think the bacon is optional, although I've always included it. I've used red potatoes and white but I think the white ones are easier because after you boil them, the skins lift off so much easier, which I prefer.

I added a little more seasoning (used Northwest seasoning from Penzeys) and some extra spinach. That's just my personal taste, though. You may not feel the need to adjust it one bit. It's a solid recipe. Everyone loved the dish and I will definitely be making it again in the future.

This dish came out really good. I didn't have green onions or the bacon and it was still tasty. I did take the advice of many and I added garlic salt and basil .... in addition I doubled the ingredients for the sauce ... and cooked mine in a 13x9 dish. As another reviewer pointed out - there is no need to boil the potatoes first - I did not and cooked dish for an hour and they were perfect.

This is one of the best recipes I've had on the website! We made it the first time for Thanksgiving and the kids loved it. We made it again for Christmas and then several times during the year. It is just really good.

I really liked this recipe and so did my family, but next time I make it, I am going to add an additional cheese, something more flavorful to give it some kick.
