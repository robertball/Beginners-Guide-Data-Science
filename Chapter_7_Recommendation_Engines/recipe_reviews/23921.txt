I have a similar recipe which is so time consuming. This one is really easy but bland. Recommendation: flash fry the meat stirring constantly. Remove. Steam the broccoli for 1 minute, drain and put aside. This keeps the bright green color and will not be falling apart when you add to the main dish. The few adjustments I made here were to add fresh garlic and 2 to 3 TBSP. of oyster sauce to the broth mix. When it's complete, add about a tsp. or so of bottled teriyaki sauce. Mix. Add the broccoli. Mix gently.  No disrespect, but Americans usually overcook veggies and meats. It took me a long time to overcome.

This is okay.  I made it for dinner with my parents last night.  My mom complained it was too sweet, I thought it didn't have any flavor, and my dad dumped so much chili sauce in it he couldn't taste anything.  My 18 month old ate a little bit, but my picky 8 year old neice said she liked it.  I tried adding real garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes, but it just still lacked something.  As my mom pointed out, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either.  I will return to my usual recipe.

Good recipe. Needs a little more garlic and 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. I think next time I will replace some of the beef broth with some pineapple juice. I also used barely cooked frozen broccoli spears then dried them well before adding them - excellent. I will make this recipe again. I would even serve to company.

This recipe turned out very well with a few changes, and my husband really enjoyed it. I served it along with brown rice prepared according to the recipe for Fried Rice Restaurant Style. I made the following changes: 1) Marinated beef in 1/4c teriyaki sauce, 1tsp minced ginger, and 1tsp minced garlic for about two hours, 2) Added 1/4c diced red onion and a bit of oil when browning the beef, 3) To the sauce, added 1/4c teriyaki sauce, an extra 1/4tsp garlic powder, and 1/2tsp crushed red pepper. I will make this again.

I used round steak, fresh garlic and added some crushed red pepper.  My roommate saidit was just as good as Chinese food and my boyfriend said it was better because you actually got some beef. I will make this again.

I agree that this does not taste like teriyaki, but it is very good.  It reminds me of steak kow that I have had at a chinese restaurant.  Next time I might try using low sodium beef broth to cut down on the saltiness.

Good flavor but I think it was because I had to jazz it up with all kinds of extras -- more soy, fresh ground ginger, ground ginger root powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper.

Very average recipe as it stands, but as per other reviewer's suggestions, adding a bit more of this and that helps boost the flavor. Definitely *not* a ''teriyaki'' recipe, however. As noted, it is a decent ''beef and broccoli'' recipe. My husband prefers well done veggies so I would at least partially boil/steam the broccoli before adding to the beef mixture as otherwise they are way too crispy for him. Overall, not a bad recipe but also not memorable.

This is really good as is.  Doesnt need any changes.  I however, tend to like things on the spicy side. If your are the same then some red pepper and garlic is really good in this one. but honestly you dont need to change a thing.

It wasn't too bad.  I do agree with others, however, that it needs a little more zing.  I think most people will do what I did and adjust it somewhat to their personal taste.  Overall, it's a pretty good base and gives a great starting point for an easy Asian meal.

This is a very easy recipe and I've made it a few times in the past. Last time, I made a couple changes as the original I find a little bland. I cook the meat with chopped onion and fresh garlic. I do not cook it until the juices evaporate since I like the meat tender. If needed, I will drain some of the excess before adding the broth mixture. Came out very tasty. There is so much room for experimentation here with different veggies and spices.

I really wanted to like this, unfortunately, I didn't. I wasn't expecting a strong teriyaki flavor based on this recipe, but I was expecting...flavor. This was extremely bland as written. The sauce didn't thicken much and I was disappointed that I wasted beef on it. After trying it as it was written, I took the remainder and started adding red pepper flakes, more soy sauce, and more garlic. It was only marginally better. I can't recommend this recipie as it is written.

I'd like to 'spice it up' from the original recipe somehow next time, but it was quite good.  It got eaten and the leftovers did, too.

This was a great base recipe! I used some other people's suggestion and added oyster sauce, and real garlic, and a sprinkle of salt to add to the flavour. I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

The recipe in general is a good base. I made a 3 serving amount so halved everything but one thing I did do that's important is to switch out the beef broth for Dashi stock (yes, this is really hard to find/you usually have to go to an Asian Foods store to find it), the other is adding in 7 spice (It's got a good heat to it), 1/2 tsp of sesame oil, onion powder to your liking, ground ginger, added 1/2 tsp extra of brown sugar to kick the extra heat, 1 tbl extra soy sauce plus started off marinating the beef in a soy/water/rice vinegar mix for 30 min before frying the beef over high heat. Also sliced 1/2 of an onion and cooked it with the beef. Steamed broccoli and also a thinly sliced carrot separately while cooking the beef and onions. Put the sauce mix in after the beef browned and cooked over high for 2 min, then added in the steamed veggies. Cooked for a few more min over high heat until the sauce was barely visible. My boyfriend is Japanese and usually quite picky with food in general but he certainly enjoyed this. =3

This recipe was great - I did add more garlic powder and brown sugar. I also cooked it with seasonal green peas and I really like the taste of green peas with the teriyaki. I would definitely recommend this and cook again!!!

I made this yesterday, and it was awesome!! The whole family loved it! I did make a couple of changes, though. Instead of broccoli, I added red pepper, sliced water chestnuts, and baby corn. I also added powdered ginger to the sauce. My 9 year-old is allergic to soy, so I made the Soy Sauce Substitute recipe (found here on Allrecipes), and used about 3-4 tablespoons. I served it with basmati rice. Will definitely be making this again!!

Marinated the meat overnight. Stir fried Thai style veggies in garlic and oil, and set aside.  Cooked meat, added sauce meat marinated in, brought to boil, addded veggies and reduced sauce (about 4 min).  Served over bowls of rice, topped with sesame seeds and chili flakes.  Family loved.  Easy, fast and tasty - perfect for a hectic work night meal.

I marinated the beef while the rice cooked. I used a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of the beef. For the marinade, I used chicken broth, a clove of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of grated fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp vinegar, coated the beef with garlic powder, and 2 tbsp of soy sauce. I filled the bowl until it covered the meat. I mixed the left over broth with two tablespoon of corn starch. Remove the beef once the rice is done but save the marinade. I used another person's suggestion and flash steamed the broccoli for a minute. Make sure your pan for your meat is super hot. Sear the meat and then add the remaining marinade till bubbly and then add your cornstarch mixture. Once it thickens remove pan and add broccoli.

Definitely more of a beef and broccoli recipe than beef teriyaki.  I doubled the sauce, and it was perfect.  The biggest change I would make would be to add more cornstarch so the sauce would thicken quicker so the broccoli would keep it's bright, green color.  With a few changes, this recipe is wonderful!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I served it over quick cooking brown rice and it was fantastic!  I made 1.5 times the sauce and there was plenty.  I will definately make this again!  Thanks!!

This definitely tasted like it needed something. Not sure what -- perhaps a marinade for beef. It was a little tough, and not very flavorful.

This is an easy semi-healthy recipe that tastes like beef and brocoli, not beef teriyaki.  I doubled the sauce, added 2 cloves of garlic, 3 green onions and some red pepper flakes.  I'll make it again but I may change the name.

The sauce for this is great. I would add some heat with red pepper flakes. The sauce can be used for everything asian, chicken, beef or veggies.  Easy to make.

I found this had excellent flavor, though I did add a dash more soy sauce and I seasned the grilling beef with kosher salt as in my experience letting thin slices of meat boil away on its own results with an odd taste that never gives way to the sauce.  In this case, however, the kosher salt and the extra bit of soy sauce and this was one OUTSTANDING dish!

This was so easy to make and really good! Next time, I'd like to use a little less sauce and let it thicken a little longer. This is a great recipe on it's own, or you can add more to personalize. I will definitely make this again!

EXTREMELY bland.  Tried to spice it up with extra garlic, chili oil, sesame, ground ginger,....and then finally added about 1/4 cup store-bought teriyaki.  It got a little better, but like others have said, something is DEFINITELY missing.

Really great recipe! It turned out fantastic. My changes: I used 1 teaspoon of grated fresh garlic and added some red pepper for spice. Also, I didn't have any broth, so I used water instead. Next time I make this dish, I'm going to use more soy sauce for some more flavor.

This was good. It was easy to make and had a decent flavor. I am sure with some tweaking it could be a five star recipe. I would make again on a time crunched evening!

Recipe idea is very good, pretty quick and easy to make to. I found it better to put those ingredients together adding some ginger, chillies, black pepper and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Marinate the beef in it for about 10-15mins and then throw it in the wok with the broccoli adding some coriander near the end to finish it off. 

Recipe is a good basis to try out your own flavours though.

Good base start recipe... but definetly needs tweaking, if there was 3.5 stars i would have rated it that.
Overall, very good and will make again!
This is the variation i did, first seasoned the meat with Mrs. Dash and pepper prior to frying, then when the meat was almost done added some soy sauce and teriyaki sauce to marinade the meat a bit more.
Then i also added to the sauce 3T of soy sauce, 2 T of brown sugar, 1/2tsp fresh gr. ginger, 1 tsp Teriakyi sauce, some red pepper flakes and an extra 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to make   a bit thicker. Was very yummy and Husband LOVED it.. Thanks!!

So yummy! I did tweak it a little to make it cheaper on my part. I used chuck steak instead of sirloin. It is just as good. I also used instant brown rice instead. Hubby really went on about it. Will make this often!

Very good recipe.  I did fry fresh garlic in a little oil before adding beef and I also added some ground ginger (no fresh ginger).  The kids really liked it and I added red pepper flakes to my bowl to give it a little spice.

Good, I do agree that it does need something else, but I'm not sure what.  I will try real garlic next time and remove the beef before cooking my broccoli so that the beef will stay tender while the broccoli cooks.  I will also add a little more cornstarch. I will definantly try this again.

Great recipe.  My daughter ask for it every night.  I take my beef out before adding the broccoli and then add it back at the end.  It stays more tender this way. Also...fresh garlic is a must!

I thought this was great!!! It tastes much better than the package beef and broccoli seasoning. I gave it a four because the beef was a little tough for me, but I don't eat alot of steak so I don't know I chose the wrong kind or not. But I thought this was great. I will make this again.

This tasted better than take out beef and broccoli! I wouldn't say it tasted like teriyaki at all, but if you double the sauce as many other reviews say and use beef tenderloin the meal is great. I put in madarin noodles instead of the rice and it was delicious. It's a hit with our family of 5!

Pretty good!  I used tenderloin instead of sirloin and garlic salt in place of garlic powder.  Next time I will double the sauce, it was just that good!  My hubbie hates broccoli, but he loved this dish.  A delicious low calorie dish!

Okay, but really, really bland. Needs some orange or pineapple juice, at least twice as much cornstarch, soy sauce, and garlic. I think next time I'll substitute half the beef broth with orange juice.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe.  I felt like I had to fiddle with the sauce some because the flavor was a little off.  It was very easy to make though, and tasty.  I will probably make it again.

Ok, so this is not beef teriyaki.  This is more like Beef & Broccoli.  And it is really good.  I double the sauce and add a little more garlic than called for (only because we LOVE garlic).  No need for carry-out!

My family and I love this recipie!  I make it all the time.  The only thing is that I like more liquid with mine to have extra for the rice so we double the beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch.  I also use closer to one or one and a half tbs of garlic powder.  But definately a tastey recipie

I made Beef Broccoli and beef teriyaki at the same time. One on one side of the stove and one on the other side.  The Beef teriyaki won hands down. The Beef Broccoli I didn't have the flavor the beef teriyaki did.  I found both recipes on this web site.

This was very good, though not very "teryaki-ish".  I added 2 teaspoons grated ginger and 3 sliced green onions.  Quick and easy to make!

I just made this dish and I loved it. It was tasty and easy to make. Yummmm... I did however add fresh garlic, a hint of ground ginger and because I didn't have corn starch I substituted  it with flour. I will definitely  make again. Thanks!

this was really easy and delicious.  Instead of cooking everything, I put the liquid mixture together and added a T of ginger powder and the steak slices in a zip lock bag and let them marinade over night in frig. Sautéed the next day then followed the recipe.   WOW so tender.   Next time I will make less rice.  This was awesome and real keeper.

Hubby liked it more than me, I thought it could use a little more flavor. Also would try a different kind of meat or else cut it very, very thin becuase it was a bit chewier than we prefered.

This was a great recipe. I did take other reviewers suggestions and added extra stuff. I added a little Teriyaki sauce and brown sugar because I like it a little sweet. I also steamed the broccoli for a few minutes before adding it to the steak. It was very easy and very tasty. I will make this again and again!

Pretty tasty, if a little bland. I let my sauce stay runny so I could have crisper veggies. Will make again, but with fresh garlic and more cornstarch.

I cooked this for my family and they loved it! The only suggestion I have is to add something to sweeten it up a little bit. I added some teriyaki sauce, but it would even be better with some pineapple in there too!

My family loved this recipe! I did add a bit more soy sauce, ground ginger, red pepper, and black pepper. One thing I would have done differently was let the meat marinate longer since the flavor wasn't as good as it could have been. Otherwise it was a wonderful dinner and we'll be making it again.

This is a good base recipe.  I've made it several times.  Sometimes I add a frozen veggie stir-fry mix instead of just the broccoli.  It also tastes good to replace the beef with chicken.

Beef Teriyaki this is not, but it is a good starter recipe for a basic beef broccoli recipe. I changed so much of it before I considered it tasty that it isn't really fair to the original recipe. I'm giving it 3 stars because it's a start...you'll just have to tweak it to your own tastes.

The ratio of meat, broccoli, rice and sauce was good.  Other than that, I don't have anything good to add.  The taste was blah and bland.  Perhaps if you  follow some of the suggestions on other reviews you will get a good variation.  As the recipe stands, don't bother.

This was a good basic starter recipe.  I made modifcations as many others. I added garlic powder, lots of ginger (personal preference), and onion powder to the meat and the sauce and of course doubled the sauce I also added teriyaki sauce to the sauce, which may have been too much sauce for us.  My hubby had seconds which is always a good sign and he gave me the okay to make it again.  It was also really simple and easy to make.

Four stars for quick and easy, sauce was nice consistency. Did use fresh garlic, mushrooms, and green onions along with the broccoli, but I agree with others that it is a bit bland. Will use this recipe again adding additional seasonings for our taste.

I hate to give a bad review, but frankly, this recipe just did not work out.  We're pretty sure it's the sauce because it smelled liked old tires (not kidding).  We followed the recipe exactly and we're both adept cooks, so I'm not sure exactly what went wrong.  We always use fresh ingredients, except the soy sauce wasn't fresh.  That's the only thing I can think of that would make this recipe taste so bad, but I've never heard of soy sauce going bad.

My family loved it!  I did add some red pepper flakes, extra garlic powder and soy sauce though, and I used cube steak for the meat.  (It was still very tender.)  This recipe will be used again and again!  Thanks :)

I think the next time I make this I may add some ketchup to the sauce as well as some crushed red pepper, perhaps some honey bc the sweetness did not come through.  The meat was very tender.  I would consider adding red pepper strips, baby corn, water chestnuts, etc. to give this dish more substance.  It was well recieved despite being a bit bland.

This was really yummy.  I added the pepper flakes as someone recommended and it was great. I would try jasmine rice just to give it extra authenticity. I thought the sauce was just right.

This recipe was really good! I doubled the recipe to have extra sauce for the rice.  The sauce was not as thick as I would have liked but I may try this recipe again.  I used chicken with chicken broth instead of beef and it turned out just as good.

My husband thought that this recipes was extremely delicious. I, on the other hand, thought that the sauce wasn't thick enough. I needed a more sweet taste to the sauce so I added Teryaki glaze and Teryaki sauce.

Delicious! This will definately go in my recipe box! I omitted the sugar and added a tablespoon of bottled teriyaki sauce. It didn't really have a teriyaki flavor but it was a great beef and broccoli recipe. Thanks!

Great sauce, but it needed a few extra touches - I added ground ginger and a dab of honey, and I reduced it more than was recommended. Delicious, even when used for a vegetarian dish.

loved it. very easy to make. I always find a recipe and then try to make it my own by adding or tweaking it a bit.

added
minced garlic to the beef while it was browning instead of the garlic powder to the teriyaki mix
thinly sliced carrots with the broccoli
2 tbsp dark brown sugar instead of just one
1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of garlic powder to the teriyaki mix. 
I didn't have corn starch so I used flower instead and I whisked it into the liquid while it simmered on low in a sauce pan separately to thicken it before adding it to the beef and broccoli.

Very good, fast dinner! The whole family loves it. Sometimes I switch it up and use the leftovers of a blade roast from the crock pot, sliced or shredded. It's already marinated, so it takes even less time.

This turned out really good! I cooked the beef first, then took it out of the pan and sauteed some onions and mushrooms in the juices. I added the beef, broccoli, garlic and sauce at the end then brought it to a boil. Delicious,  I'll make it again

The meat definitely needs to be marinated beforehand- had no flavor, not to mention the acidity would help tenderize this cut of beef. I added close to a tsp of ginger powder (would be better with fresh) and more garlic powder. Like others said, it’s a great “base recipe” but really does need more zing. I took it off my list :(

The recipe was fine. I liked that I did not have to buy anything extra. I am not sure what you mean by glutenous rice since rice does not contain gluten.

Loved this dish. It was quick and easy . Had a great flavor and not too sweet.  I added a little fresh garlic and ginger and a splash of mirin to the broth mixture. When cooking the beef I added a little fish sauce and a splash of sesame oil.  We only had brown rice and the nutty flavor was nice. I also added sliced green onion to the top. Will definitely make again.

Easy to prepare and very good. Served with brown rice instead of white. Mixed in thinly sliced carrots, onions and bell peppers. A bonus, great as leftovers.

I made this tonight exactly as the recipe called for. Unfortunately it turned out to be very bland and lacking in taste. Once this was done And everyone in my household told me the same thing about it's blandness I then tried adding more soy sauce, oyster sauce, and a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce. However nothing could overcome the sheer blandness of this recipe.  no I will not make it again.

Very easy, and quick.
Sautéed onions and garlic in olive oil and the meat drippings after browning the meat. 
Added meat to boiling liquid seasonings
Added broccoli last 2 min. to keep it firm. 
Added a little more seasoning for flavor.

Sauce came out great but it still needs a bit more of a flavor. More of a beef and broccoli than a beef teriyaki. This was a really good starter recipe!

Incredible! I browned the meat with sesame seed oil and half a shallot. Then I added sesame seeds and ground ginger to the sauce mix. Wow!

I made this for my husband and toddler.  Both liked it very much and my husband said it tasted as if I went to our local chinese place for takeout.

This recipe has good bones and came out pretty well.  I did salt and pepper the steak while it was cooking and will add garlic powder with S&P next time.  The steak was a little tough since the recipe said to wait until the juices evaporate, so I'll probably fool around with the heat next time.  All in all, it tasted great and the changes I mentioned are small.

A little bland. Next time, we will add Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce... We added ginger, ground mustard, and garlic salt after tasting the dish while it was cooking.

My family really liked this recipe. I doubled all the ingredients listed in step 3 because they like a lot of sauce.  It was a hit and something I'll definitely make again!

So easy to make.  I one-and-a-halfed the soy, broth, garlic powder, and cornstarch to make a little more sauce.  Went over very well.  Nice flavor and quick to throw together after work.

This is a good recipe, but somewhat bland.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger to taste (you can use fresh), sweet and sour bar-b-que sauce (about 1 cup), lots of black pepper and chili powder (about 1/2 tsp. to taste).  I also chopped two vidalia onions and added with the brocolli.
