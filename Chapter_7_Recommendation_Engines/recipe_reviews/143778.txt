these were great! we grilled them with a little bit of olive oil on them. then, i was lazy and just sprinkled the balsamic on top along with the seasoning. then, we had bleu cheese that everyone could add and it really melded well with the sweetness of the peach and the acidity of the vinegar. will definitely make again.

Mmm.  I love these!  Perfect hot off the grill.  I put them in a grill basket to make it easier on myself (and to use the grill basket--just bought it, so I want to use it with everything!).  I also misread the recipe and mixed the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil instead of drizzling it on.  Still really good that way.  Thanks so much!

I made these twice after tasting a similar recipe in Colorado.  My husband liked them and made them the second time for my son, wife and grandchildren.  The children ages 2 and 4 did not like them but everyone else did.  Very easy recipe and healthy.  Thanks!  I since tried this again planning to serve it with grilled pork tenderloin and bought nectarines instead of peaches (that is all the store had).  I could not get the nectarines to split, my husband even tried and we mushed up 2 nectarines so gave it up.  Are nectarines harder to split in half than peaches???

Allrecipes almost never disappoints me!!!  I went peach picking today and when I got home, a few were bruised from being jammed in the bag, so I decided to have them with dinner, but how to make?  This seemed perfect, almost more savory than sweet, a perfect accompaniment to the rotisserie chicken i picked up at the farm.  I've had grilled peaches (sweet) before and loved them, but this just fell flat.  I really don't care for the combination of flavors at all.  And there was way more than enough vinegar, it was swimming in the bottom of the bowl, I think you can definitely cut down on that.  Oh well.

I really liked these. I had pears, and it worked well. I forgot my parsley. So I just sprinkled a little Gorgonzola on them. Nice.

This was an unusually appetizing dish. I wasn't sure how I would like a savory peach, but the balsamic vinegar and natural sweetness of the peach balanced each other out quite nicely. I'm glad I tried this despite my doubts because I would've missed out on a great recipe!

These were pretty good... I served these with steak and a variety of grilled vegies (zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, mushrooms, yellow bell peppers), grilled corn on the cob.

We all loved it.(adults) No cajun but topped with goat cheese. It is very rich, but delish. The kids did not like the peaches grilled let alone the balsamic or cheese.

These were excellent and very easy to make.  They almost tasted like dessert but are pretty healthy at the same time.
