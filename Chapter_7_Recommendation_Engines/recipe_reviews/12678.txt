I feel like I've been saved a lot of trouble and time by finding this recipe.  I don't need to look further.  I actually get compliments on the crust.  The butter adds flavor while the crisco adds flakiness.  Also, a couple of hints: After you have molded the pie crust to the pan, rest it in the refrigerator for 40 minutes.  This relaxes the gluten and reduces shrinkage.  After 40 minutes, put it directly into the freezer for 20 minutes (this step increase flakiness).  Add the filling quickly and bake immediately.  Of course,this added step is if you're truly in pursuit of perfection, but isn't essential.  Lastly, I am not very talented at rolling out the dough and peeling it off the counter.  Plus, adding flour to the counter alters the recipe.  I discovered that if I roll it out between 2 pieces of large saran wrap, I can unpeel one piece, flip it onto the pie plate and then unpeel the second piece of saran wrap without ever even having to touch it with my hands.  This was a great discovery!  Thanks for this truly exceptional recipe.  Try this crust with the Apple Crumble Pie recipe on this site!

OMG! This has to be one of the BEST pie crusts I've ever had on this site! It's so delicious, and so flaky yet easy to roll out that I can see why this person has won County Fair competitions with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly using cake flour which I have to admit I've never used in pie crust before - I doubled the recipe for a deep dish pie "Vermont Apple Pie" from this site to be exact. I used butter flavored shortening and found that I only need 8 Tbsp. of the egg yolk, water/vinegar mixture. I chilled the dough in the freezer for a bit and then I rolled the dough out onto wax paper that was lightly floured and it was a breeze to put into a deep dish pie plate. It baked up beautifully! I'm so glad I found this recipe!!!

This is by far my favorite pie crust recipe! It sounds a little labor intensive but it's not too bad. The key is to keep things cold and to handle the crust as little as possible so the gluten doesn't break down (which makes it tough and not flaky). I always just used a fork instead of a food processor and regular AP flour and it turns out wonderful. I've also used frozen butter cut with a cheese grater (easier then a fork) and it worked out great.

Excellent! This is THE very BEST pie crust I have ever made! I didn't use the cake flour...just doubled my regular flour (the ONLY flour I will bake with is White Lily, which is ground "extra fine") and it turned out perfect! Like some of you, I have been searching for a good pie crust recipe for years...and I finally found it. Thanks to Carole for sharing it with us!

Great recipe!  Will not use any others from now on. I was in charge of pies for Thanksgiving this year.  Although I am a pretty good baker, I don't consider pies one of my specialties.  The other problem was I had to work through Wednesday and didn't know how I would have time to make 6 pies Wednesday night after working all day!  I made six crusts with this recipe the weekend before Thanksgiving and froze them.  Wednesday night I pulled them out and added the various fillings and baked.  They came out perfectly!!! Also -- I followed Mindy W's advice about rolling the crust out between saran wrap.  WOW!! EASY AND NO MESS!!! Thank-you!

Definitely one of the best pie crusts that I have ever made.  I love to bake, but I tend to shy away from pies since my crust always comes out tough.  Although this recipe requires a few additional steps, I think it is well worth the extra effort.  As Carole recommends, the key is to sprinkle the liquid mixture a little at a time.  (I used about 4 Tbsp.)  At first, mine felt a little too moist but I sprinkled a little flour on the dough prior to rolling it out and it came out just right.  I recommend rolling it out between wax paper so that once the crust has been placed in the pan you can peel off the wax paper without tearing the dough.  The only additional step I took was to refrigerate the crust for about 15-20 minutes after I placed it in the pan.  I've been told you need to let the gluten relax after you've rolled it out to avoid too much shrinkage when pre-baking the crust.  All I can say is my pie crust came out pretty close to perfect.  My husband gave the crust a thumbs up.  Thanks Carole!

Thanks for the recipe.  For 35 years I have only made pastry using a pound of lard.  The results were good but sometimes I didn't want to make that much.  This an excellent, flaky pie crust with a perfect flavour.  It is definitely a keeper and I will likely be using this most of the time now.  :o)

This makes a tasty, rich and tender crust.  The recipe made enough for a 9.5 in. deep dish single crust.  I found I needed only about 1/4 c. of the ice water, which I mixed with the egg yolk and vinegar without the extra water and ice cubes.  I chilled the dough only slightly, then rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper to keep it from sticking.

This makes the best pie crust ever! My husbands father would not stop eating and his bake-a-holic aunt could not believe I made it from scratch!  I had to 2 1/2 the recipe to make a large, lattice top apple pie. I made it the night before and referigerated it until the next morning and it worked great! I wont ever use another crust recipe!

I made this for the Cherry Rhubarb recipe and it was FANTASTIC!!!  My mother even said it was the flakiest pie crust she had ever had (she herself is a terrific baker). I messed up the first time and the dough was too wet but I added a little more flour and used that as the bottom crust. My food processor is a mini-processor and it could not take all of the ingredients, so when I made the second crust for the top I followed the receipe up til the part where it says to add the balance of the crisco and butter.  I removed the first batch of flour and shortening and just added a little bit of flour back in for the remaining crisco and butter.  It is very important to gently fluff the wet ingredients into the flour or you WILL END UP WITH WET DOUGH!
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was horrible.  I don't know if it was operator error, but my dough was very moist (apparently, I am still not sure if that was the problem) and when I tried to roll it stuck to everything, and by the time I got it on top of my potpie it was in several pieces (appearance was gross).  I had to cook it 10 extra minutes on my pie, and it still tasted undercooked although it was brown.  It was very tender.. too tender... it turned into complete mush!  Yuck. I almost couldn't eat... almost.

This recipe was really simple and worked great. I was actually trying to figure out what to do with the cake flour in my pantry anyhow (I bought too much for a recipe and that was the only recipe that I had that called for cake flour until now.) I doubled the recipe and made a wonderful apple pie with it. Note:After added the maximum amount of water, it will seem a little dry still and hard to hold together. This is O.K. Just mold it into a ball, wrap in saran and put in the fridge for 20 minutes. When I started rolling mine it basically fell apart and kept on breaking into little pies. Just keep rolling these pieces. They will come together. I rolled mine on wax paper for easier transfer to the pie plate. I put a little flour on my rolling pin when needed, but otherwise didn't add any extra flour. Great recipe! Great flavor! Only my 2nd attempt making crust and came out perfect. I will keep this recipe in my folders!

I went back and made this recipe a second time and the dough came out really moist. Not dry at all like the first time. I have made 2 more pies since then and the dough always turns out moist. I think the first time when I doubled it I added too much flour or not enough butter/shortening, but this time it came out even better! So this recipe deserves 6 stars because it came out great even when I apparently messed it up! :)

This is similar to a recipe I've used with great results before except for the mixture of regular and cake flour, and the addition of the baking powder, so I thought I'd give it a try.   When preparing the wet ingredients, I substituted some brandy, which happened to be on the counter, for the vinegar. A dash of alcohol can make pastsry flakier, and I thought the flavor would go well. I don't know whether this made any difference to the final product, but in any case, it came out wonderful! It was rich and flaky, and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

OMG is all I can say about this crust. Read most of the reviews prior to trying & thank God for all of you who have tested, tried and will take the time to review recipes. This is the best pie crust ever. I didn't handle the crust all all like the viewers said, didn't even add flour when I rolled the crust out. Followed directions to a tea except I didn't have cake flour so instead I used bread flour because it's all I had. The frozen butter thing worked great with a shreader and I laid down two long pieces of wax paper and didn't have to flour them because I worked with the dough very cold and kept the other one in fridge until bottom crust was formed. I didn't think I'd be able to follow the recipe (seemed complicated) but I took my time and did it word for word and it was an unbelievable crust. My apples created a lot of juice but the bottom crust withstood the juice. I baked pie on 400 for 1st 15 min and turned to 350 for remaining 45 min. This is restaurant quality crust and thank God for all the wonderful people who share their secrets, God bless you all! but special thanks to Carolealana.

Great pie crust.  I freeze the butter than grate it on the bigger holes, then freeze again.  This makes the adding of the moisture super quick and easy.

This is one of those recipes some cooks would never be kind enough to share. Thank you!!!  The top crust is extra special if you  froth the left over egg white, brush it over the top crust, and sprinkle it with coarse sugar (though regular will do), right before baking.  One precaution:
 Do not just "throw in" the ice water mixture in the last step, but start with a few tablespoons and only add enough water for the dough to stick together but not be wet. Chances are you will not use more than 5 Tablespoons.
But as I said, this recipe makes a treasure of a crust!

I already had a good pie crust recipe but needed one that would hold together better.  This recipe was fantastic.  It had body yet was flaky, and the flavor was marvelous.  Keeping everything cold as Carole instructs is important.  I used apple cider vinegar since I was out of white vinegar, and it was fine.  I will definitely make this pie crust many more times.

I wouldn’t go as far as to say that this is the best pie crust I’ve ever had, but it is good.  It is very light and flaky and almost had a buttery cracker quality.  The dough would have been too runny had I added all of the liquid mixture.  I ended up only using about 2/3 and the dough was the perfect consistency.  Mine did crack a little while rolling, but it mended easily.   Personally, I think this crust is better suited for quiche, as I’d prefer a denser crust for fruit pies.  I’ll definitely make this again.

Very easy to make, I chilled it just a few short minutes and used all butter, no shortening as we don't really good with that in Australia, and mine actually was quite dry if anything, not moist as other reviewers have found. I made cake flour by substituting a 1/4 cup corn starch for the rest normal bread flour too as that's how we make cake flour.

I have made many piecrust from scratch for many, many years and I also thought this was the worst!!!! I think you meant to say to use 2 3/4 cups of flour and then 3/4 cup cake flour. The liquid ingrediants are enough for a 2 crust dough, hench it needs much more flour than just 1 and 1/4 cup, I had a bowl of mush....twice!!!! I will make my own recipe from now on but I might add the baking powder for a change.

This recipe did not work for me. I've made tons of pie crusts in my life, but this was without doubt the worst.  I wrestled with it for a while, but it kept ripping and sticking, even after chilling it and rolling it out on a cold marble slab!  I finally made my regular crust instead.

This is a WONDERFUL pie crust recipe!!!!  It sounds complicated but it's not.  No food processor so used a pastry cutter to make the dough and worked well.  It was a warm day so had to work quickly.  Definately want to chill before rolling out the dough and then again after putting in pie plate.  Looking forward to using this recipe for MANY, MANY more pies.  Thanks for the posting!!!!!!!

I have always used my Granma's & Mom's pie crust recipe.  It is a good standard pie crust and super easy, but has always left me wanting for a little more.  Well I go a LOT more with this recipe.  It takes a little more time to prepare, but is worth every second.  I will never use another pie crust recipe!!!

I have been making pie crusts for longer than I can remember and they all came out fairly okay.  But when I tried your recipe my family couldn't stay away from my pies.
This recipe was wonderful!  Thanks a bunch for sharing!

I'm not rating this because I didn't follow instructions, and I'm pretty sure it'd work beautifully in a food processor, but I never drag that thing out (not dishwasher friendly). If I can't make it with my stand mixer, it doesn't get made. I gave it a shot, and though I have successfully made other pie crusts with the KitchenAid—there's one in the book that came with the mixer—this wasn't forgiving at all. It rolled out very poorly. Extremely sticky. Appreciate it being here, just the same. I might reconsider it if I had a ton of pies to do, making it worth getting the food processor dirty.

More shortbread than pie crust.  

This dough is way to moist and delicate to work with.  I've made it twice now and reduced the amount of the liquid added to the flour mixture and it was still a pain to roll out.  I doubled the recipe and added 5 T of liquid to make a two crust pie the second time.  Rolled it out between Saran wrap.  It tore while placing the bottom crust into the pan and I had to pat it in place.  The top crust actually broke around the edge while baking.  

As for the baked texture, it is more like shortbread than pastry.  Not 'flaky' at all, but crumbly and tender instead.  Perhaps it is the addition of the baking powder.  That wouldn't be bad if it wasn't such an ordeal to work with.

This recipe worked out marvelous!!  My mom and I both made pies for dessert.  My mom with her frozen pie crust and I used this recipe.  Well, needless to say, mom asked for the recipe when all was said and done!!!  Very flaky and quite easy, especially considering it was the first pie crust I've ever made from scratch!!!

All I can say about this recipe is WOW! Good by to the days of crumbly dough or dough that can be used as cement.  This is an awesome recipe and I thank Ms. Rhodus for sharing this.

Absolutely fabulous.  I cooked a big dinner party with Quiche for appetizers and cherry pie for dessert and used this for both.  It turned out flakey and perfect.  I even used a hand blender instead of a food processor.  I've definitely replaced my old one of flour, shortening, and water.  This is 10 times better!

Flaky and delicious!  My only problem was the dough stuck to my countertop and rolling pin.  Next time, I'll roll it out on my silicone cooking sheets.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recioe!!  However I found it almost too flaky when I had to transfer it to other homes.  If you cut back a small amount on the cake flour snd increase the regular flour by the amount cut, It makes almost no difference. ( except a little more stable to move to another place)

This is the best pie crust.  I get compliments on it every time.  Roll out thin, but don't overwork.  It gets temperamental sometimes, easily breaking or becoming dry and hardened.  I like substituting the shortening for more butter.  I save the egg white after separating it from the yolk, then use it to seal the top and bottom crust.  Then I brush it onto the top crust for a nice glaze before making some slits for steam to escape.

Thanks Carole and thanks MINDY W.  The recipe was perfect and the instructions for chilling/freezing were  very helpful.  I don't have a food processor so I did this all with my pastry cutter.  This was my first attempt at making pie crust (other than cookie crumb crust) and it went sooooooo great!! I only used 3 T of the egg liquid so I made two batches of dry ingredients and used the same batch egg liquid mixture for both.  I didn't prebake the crust: I made both crusts and rolled them out between a piece of wax paper (on the bottom) and a piece of saran wrap (on top), pressed one into the pie shell and rolled the other out flat for the top piece then left both in the fridge overnight.  Then the next day I popped the shell and top piece in the freezer for 20 mins, filled with a rhubarb custard filling, fluted and vented the pie, washed with milk and sprinkled with white sugar.  45 minutes later: YUM CITY!!!!

I have only made a pie crust a couple of times before and this crust came out awesome and was pretty easy to handle too.  I don't usually like the taste of pie crust very much, but this one tastes good all on its own.  I used butter flavored shortening.

I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this recipe.  I've tried to make it twice now and both times I ended up with a wet, sticky mess before I even used up half of the liquid ingredients.  

On the second batch, I stopped adding the liquid once the dough came together and just started to become too wet.  I gently kneaded in a couple tablespoons of flour before wrapping it up and sticking it in the fridge.  Honestly, I'm afraid to make a pie with it, I picked my own apples at a local farm and I don't want the thing to come out a big soggy mess.  I guess we'll see what happens!

So Good!!!  GREAT for both sweet and savory items. I was not sure if this would work because I left it in the fridge for 2 days or so after making.  I had it rolled into a ball and tightly wrapped.  I had unwrapped it Sunday to check it out and it turned out wonderful!  So very flaky and reminds me of my Grandmothers... except the lard.  Will use this one again

We were so excited to try ths recipe with all the great reviews.  Followed it to the T but the crust would not firm up, too soft leading to it falling apart any time we tried to put it in the pie crust pan.  Perhaps if we had stored it in the freezer instead of the fridge it would have worked but not worth the trouble of trying again--we'll stick with my more basic (less ingredients) recipe next time.

Amazing crust. Best ever. Like others I was intimidated by pie crusts but, no more. I read a bunch of the reviews and the main message was to keep everything as cold as possible. For example if i had to answer the phone during the process or i got pulled away for some other reason I would stick the batter in the fridge/freezer. Like someone suggested I used grated frozen butter and I used a shortening that I bought from a health food store, it is made of coconut and olive oil(love it). I just used a fork to lightly mix everything, no processor. My hands never touched the dough because I rolled it out between wax paper. After i put the rolled out dough in the pan and pulled of the wax paper off i chilled it again for 40 minutes before adding the filling and baking. What an amazing flaky buttery crust. I can't imagine making a better one. I made a broccoli quiche. Oh and i used about three quarters of the wet solution. The batter seemed wet but turned out perfect. I will use this batter for making portuguese custard tarts next.

There is no better pie crust than this. I have made this now with the Apple Pie by Grandma Ople about 20 times, and the only response I get is that this is the best pie ever; Some add "and I don't even like apple pie". FOLLOW the directions and don't vary anything!

I am 62 years old & have been trying to make a decent pie crust for half my life....this one is the only one you will need,trust me. I use it to make meat pies too..I add some dried herbs to the dry ingredients when making these meat pies....adds a little pizazz. Buy yourself some of those little aluminum pie tins & make mini pies.....cut out a heart of dough & place on top...bake pie as usual. Give to someone & tell them you made the pie with love just for them!! People feel special when they get their own little pie....this piecrust will make all the difference to whatever filling you use.

This is truly the HOLY GRAIL of Pie Crusts!
 Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe!!!
 I just made 2 pies for Thanksgiving and never had so many compliments on my pie crusts. (Frankly I NEVER had any compliments on my pie crusts,  previously.) Even my finicky, hard to please 88 year old Aunt said it was just like "old time" flakey crust and wanted to know the recipe. 
 I followed the wise, gracious advice of another reviewer and rolled out the dough between 2 pieces of saran wrap so my hands never touched the dough, no extra flour was used that might alter the recipe, and made for easy transference onto the pie pan. Once I molded the dough on the pie pan, I chilled it 40 minutes in the fridge to relax the gluten, and for added complete, flakiness perfection, I then followed her advice and put it in the freezer an addl' 20 minutes. What a difference! This crust will make any baker envious!
 Do yourself a favor, please try this recipe with the added hints. It adds a few steps, but you won't be disappointed. It not only tastes good, its gorgeous in presentation.  
 Happy Baking!

Followed this to a T and I even put it in the fridge and freezer to try and yield the best results.  I do have to say I was scared because my food processor did not combine this well at all, maybe because i was making a double batch for Grandma Opels Apple Pie but a lot stuck to the bottom and I though I over mixed it then when tasting it after it was done, it tasted a lot like the vinegar and I was dissapointed after all the work i had done.  I did not lattice the top but just put in several slits and baked the pie hoping for it to be partly edible.  boy oh boy, my Mother in law is one of the best pie bakers I've ever met and my husband and I both said this was the BEST pie we've ever eaten!  I can't wait to make it for family!  We both devoured this nightly until it was gone (4 days)!  You need to try the pie recipe with this crust, I was even eating the harder edges plain, you know where they get fat and hard, i've never eaten those and I could eat a bowl of it alone!  There is a delicious sauce that goes on the top of the crust in the recipe which worried me as well, I thought it would compromise the apple pie flavor but it turned out to be the best part.  You must try, you won't be dissapointed and i'm pretty sure it's fool proof if I made it that great!

This is the best pastry recipe I've ever used.  I don't have a food processor; I cut the fat in by hand with a pastry cutter and it worked fine, so you don't neccesarily HAVE to use a food processor.  : )    There are more steps involved in this recipe than others I've used, but it's definitley worth the effort.  I'll use this recipe for all my pies in the future.  Thanks!

I have been searching for this recipe my whole life. I always used to use the one on the inside of the shortening container, but found  it too flakey and flavourless. This one is perfect. My husband loves pie and says that this recipe may be even better than his mother's.

This is truly a good crust! I used it to make pecan pie, and it was delicious. I used a pastry cutter instead of the processor though, and it was simple, came together nicely, and easy to roll! Thank you!

I would recommend that you try this recipe out a few days in advance to make sure of the end result and your ability to do it. I used this recipe the first time to make 4 crusts. I ended up with crusts that are way too dry and cracking as I try to fold them. I literally was screaming in the kitchen, as it is Thanksgiving morning and now I have to redo my crusts.

My pie crusts were always hard and difficult to cut through. But since I found this pie crust on All receipes' Cookbooks, I can't stop making copies for people. I also send them right to All receipes Cookbook for more receipes. This is the number one pie crust receipe in my church and circle of friends. Thanks CR

This recipe was a waste of my time.  It was way too moist to work with and ended up tasting like a biscuit.  I didn't have apple pie...I had biscuits and fruit!  I won't even bother with it again and it's being removed from my recipe box.

Best pie crust ever!! The only recipe I use - I just tossed out all the others! If you have any extra - roll it out and cut into squares with pizza cutter, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and bake at 425 degrees until lightly browned. I call them "Pie Crisps" and they are yummy!!

I've been using the old Betty Crocker pie crust recipe for years with mixed results.  I was looking for a change.  This pie crust was perfect; tender and flaky and it did not crack at the edges. It was so easy to work with. I froze one for next time for an even easier pie making experience.  A++++

FINALLY!  Thank you Carole!  I had all but stopped making pies because every crust recipe was either tough or tasteless or just too hard to attempt.  I decided to give it one more try with your recipe and am I glad I did!  Everyone loves this crust.  Even my son who always leaves the crust on his plate eats this one all up!  It is delicious, easy to roll out and so flaky!

Horrible! Thought I would try this since everyone else was raving about it, but found it to be a time consuming, flat tasting, impossible mess. I would never make this again and encourage people to not be snowed by the raving reviews. Don't expect a miracle pie crust with THIS one. It ruined my three Thanksgiving pies by not rolling out AT ALL and generally tasting VERY bland.  How embarrassing! NOT recommended!

Absolutely the best pie crust recipe ever!
For those (like myself) who don't have a food processor, here's what I did. I sifted all dry ingredients with a fork. Again I did this when mixing the first clump of butter. (butter should be thoroughly mixed at this point, mixture should be slightly sticky {ie, if you squeeze it through your fingers, some clumps should hold) and you should be able to see the butter cloloring uniformly throughout, no chunks, etc.)
When it came time to add the second clump, I cut the butter up into 1/4 inch chunks and dropped them in. Then I used two forks and, as if I were cutting spaghetti for kids, and mixed the butter around until pea sized chunks were floating around the mixture.

Loved working with it and it tasted good. I didnt use all the liquid, and Im glad I added water in portions. I used it for Pumpkin pies and Apple pie. With Pumpkin I poked with fork and baked it for 5 min, and it still was a little raw. It baked well with apple filling. Stores well in fridge.

Loving it!  I just threw everything together in my mixer (dry ingredients first) and yep, what a great crust!  I skipped the ice cubes, did not freeze anything, no extras, and even though my dough was a slightly greasy from the room temp butter, I had no fuss at all.

I've never been that great at making dough, but this recipe was fairly easy even without a processor. The Crust was amazing, flakey, and strong. I could I have picked up my whole apple pie without it falling apart. The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars is because there wasn't enough dough I had to switch to a smaller pan

This recipe is the FIRST pie crust recipe I ever tried.  I have never baked a pie before this, so I used this crust recipe to make a Blueberry pie.  That pie turned out to be sooo good I think it could be a county fair blue ribbon winner!   I didn't refrigerate and freeze the dough as long as directed because I didn't have time, but it turned out just right!  I went online and searched for a video on how to make a lattice crust.  It was actually easy and looked beautiful! You can see a picture on my page.  I put foil around the crimped part of the crust for the first 15 minutes while baking so it didn't burn.  It came out perfectly lightly browned!

This was my first attempt at making a pie crust from scratch...it turned out absolutely beautiful!  I added a picture so you can see for yourself!  I doubled the recipe for a 2-crust apple pie and added a teaspoon of sugar for a little sweetness.  My Mother, who is notorious for her picture-perfect flakey pie crusts, was so impressed she wanted the recipe as well...wow.

I, too, have been on the great pie crust quest. I had my mother's recipe but that was for the 8" pies 30 years ago. So I had to change the proportions and consequently, it got lost in translation. It is an oil crust which is fine but is thin in a deep dish pie plate. I've included 2 pics; one, uncooked and one just out of the oven. It remains for the judge (my hubby) to rate it! LOL

This is my 4th time making a pie crust and the ones before this one always turned out tough and chewy but this recipe was very flakey and had nice flavor.  I guess the vinegar and egg really make a difference.  This is the best recipe I have made so far and I will use this from now on.   I still can't believe I made this crust.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've never been very good with pie crusts, but this one is by far the very best.  Like other reviewers, I was able to roll it out between plastic wrap.  Therefore, it was very easy to work with.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  I will use it often.

What a nice pie crust! I'm a first-time pie maker, and this still came out lovely. I did not have cake flour on hand, so I measured out 3/4 cup regular flour, took out about 3/4 tbsp of flour, and replaced it with an equal amount of cornstarch. I sifted this mixture before adding the other 3/4 cup of flour, and sifted again (I figured I might as well). I used a hand blender to mix together the butter and shortening before putting it in the freezer, which made it easier to work with when it came out. As per the recipe, I put half the fat into the food processor with the flour mixture, and then cut in the rest of the fat by hand.   I was careful not to overmix, rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper (great tip), and actually I don't have a rolling pin so I used a wine bottle (it worked). I also let the dough relax in the fridge both before and after rolling out. Came out with just the right texture and a subtle flavor, goes well with either sweet or savory flavors. I think the mixture of shortening and butter really gives this a nice flavor.

If you're a first time pie maker like me, make sure you cut up your butter into small slices before you add it to the flour or it won't break up right. I had to scrap my first crust because it took too much mixing when I just stuck the whole stick in (hey, I didn't know any better). And don't use all of the liquid, just enough to make the dough stick together when lightly turning it in with a fork. Delicious crust for my first pie!

I haven't made enough pie crusts to declare this one the best, but I was happy with the way it turned out and would definitely make it again. I don't see why some people think it's time-consuming or hard--I didn't find it to be so.

When initially viewing this recipe, I thought it seemed like a lot of ingredients and a lot of trouble. Upon further inspection, however, I realize that it's really not that many ingredients. It seems like a lot of steps but it's just because all of the steps are explained so well. This turned out perfectly for me, and I'm not a very experienced "pastry chef". Flavor was fantastic and it was quite flaky. Perfect.

This is an amazing pie crust. I used it for a pot pie recipe the first time and it was amazing. It is also great for sweet pies. It makes a flawless crust. This is now my mainstay recipe for pie crust.

Very very good. Made it for my thanksgiving pumpkin chiffon pies. (Even used the excess dough to make cookies- I can't stop eating 'em!) I made two batches, and messed up the first one because of inexperience. The first attempt I tried to use a makeshift food processor and it came out too wet so I added ½ cups four. Then I put it in the fridge w/o wrapping and it came out dry… So in the end the dough was rather overworked. THEN to top it off I baked it w/o poking any holes in it, and it became a balloon!!! So to all of you first timers- ALWAYS remember to poke the pie crust before you bake it if you’re not adding a filling. But the second one came out beautifully! I still added ½ cup flour but monitored my liquid a little bit better. I learned from my mistakes and its moist, flaky, and slightly sweet. Yummy yummy!

I ended up adding too much liquid (dough was a little sticky), but this crust STILL turned out perfectly!  I will not be using any other crust recipes - this is definitely IT.  I also didn't have cake flour, but did not think the crust suffered for it.

my food processor is ridiculously small. so when i was trying to fit everything in, taking half out, cutting in frozen butter by hand ... i thought, this had better be worth it. and it absolutely was. hopefully, though, i'll have a bigger better food processor before i want to make pie again. but i will use this recipe every time. thanks!

The best pie crust out there. This is one area that I struggle with and have been on the lookout for a good pie crust recipe for a long time. Mine are always either too dry or too wet and making pie ends up throwing me into a tizzy. This recipe made things SO easy. Came out perfect. The extra steps are definitely worth it.So flaky and flavorful! This is going in my recipe box for sure!!

Bland!  Judges said I would have won 1st place with my praline apple pie, except for the crust so I got 3rd.  This crust tasted like cardboard.  I even tried to make it again, except added 1/4 of sugar to make it more like a sugar cookie, didn't help it out much.  Still looking for a better recipe.

This worked okay but the flavor of the crust was not as good as my usual recipe. Also the baking powder made the crust puff up a little too much.

Yes, this recipe does take a little longer than most pie crust recipes but it is THE BEST crust i have ever tasted.  My family raved about how delicious it was- not too salty but not too sweet and SO FLAKY!! Yum! I added 3 1/2 TBS of the egg/vinigar/water mixture and it came out perfect! Thanks for the best pie crust recipe! None compare!

This was the first pie crust I've ever attempted.  I was so happy with the results.  The crust came out perfectly (just like Mom's if not better...and, she makes a mean pie crust).  I can't imagine finding another recipe so the work, for someone who doesn't know any better, was no big deal.  Definitly a keeper recipe.  Thanks.

I can eat this crust all day long. If you are going to make a pie you might as well make it with the BEST pie crust there is. This is it. It is worth the hard work. I think the secret is how you mix the butter and shortening into the flour. You have to make sure the butter or shortening are not mixed in well. Instead they must be cut into small pieces pea-sized or even larger is ok.

This is a wonderful crust and I'll admit that it does take a bit longer than others, but I agree with other reviewers that you can either do fillings or cleanup while chilling ingredients...it's worth the time. My husband really liked the fresh apple pie I made with this crust...it had good flavor and consistency first time around!  I saved the leftover liquid mixture in the fridge for future pies (used yogurt containers work good for this.)

My search for a really excellent pie crust is over.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers, and did not find this too time consuming or difficult, especially since it can be done with a food processor, and a filling can be made and set aside while the butter and shortening are freezing.  I doubled the recipe, freezing half.  There was no need to double the liquid mixture, since I only used about 6 1/2 tablespoons. The crust turned out perfectly. Really good for fruit pies.

Terrific.  I'm not a huge fan of crust and I still loved this one.  I made it for an apple pie for my friend and it came out outstanding.  I saw her litterally picking every piece of crust off her plate with her fork.  Only thing I did different was I used a pastry cutter instead of a food processor since I don't own a food processor.  Chilled for 45 minutes in the freezer.  Rolled it out.  And it came out perfect.  Very flaky, not tough at all, and absolutely delicious.

Wow, I have never had such a great pie crust.  I used it to make a pot-pie and I recieved many complements.  Wasn't hard to make, either (I skiped the chilling stage and it still turned out fine).  Highly recomended.

Even though it took a little planning it was well worth the effort.  My husband & I both loved the flaky crust.  Next time I make it I will more then double it so I will have it on hand in the freezer.

I, too, had been pie crust challenged until this recipe came along.  I helped my 5th grade son and his 2 friends make sweet potato pies for a Civil War project for school and the results were amazingly beautiful and delicious! I give it an A+ (hope the teacher does, too!)

I was not real impressed with this recipe.  For one, I don't have a food processor so it took quite a bit longer to prepare, and it was a big sticky mess!!  It tasted okay, but is not worth the extra time it takes to prepare.  I think I'll stick with my normal pie crust recipe that uses flour, salt, oil and water.  That's it!!  It always comes out great and tastes just as good if not better than this one.  Sorry - I was hoping I had found "THE" pie crust recipe; not this time!

This really is a terrific recipe.  I am a novice baker myself, but the instructions were very clear so I was okay.  It is a bit time consuming and certainly has more ingredients than your standard recipe, but I think the end result is worth it!  Very flakey and has good flavor!

I have never been able to turn out a decent pie crust...until this one!  Truly the best I've ever tasted. I even dumped the egg & water in the flour mixture too quickly and the dough was overly moist.  It still turned out perfect.  The nicest part of is that it makes a generous amount of dough.  I made a double crust pie and had plenty of scraps left for cinnamon sugar pieces that we all like so much.  Thanks Carole!  Great recipe!  What else do you make???

Fantastic. I have never made a pie before (although I have sampled my fair share) and this recipe was easy and delicious.  If you do it right the crust will come out light, flaky, and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and found it was enough for a double crust in an 11 inch pan while keeping a fairly thick crust. DO NOT OVERWORK THE DOUGH and DO NOT MIX IN THE LIQUID IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR.  Also don't be afraid to chill in the freezer instead of the refrigerator for a more effective temperature control.

I use fresh lemon juice in place of vinegar, both should work well.  When placing the dough in plastic wrap it helps to form it into a disc first more easily roll out. Thanks for the recipe!

Was very delicious and flaky. Pie crust seems to be very delicate and finicky but this one was easy to get right, even for me! I didn't have cake flour so I just used all-purpose flour instead and I mixed with a fork since I didn't have a food processor. It was still amazing with the slight changes. I have tried other pie recipes and this one is by far the best, its a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

My Grandmother used that recipe for many years so it became our favorite.
I make a double batch and freeze it in pie size balls. You can keep it in the freezer for many months. I have had it frozen for 7 months and it baked up just as good as the first day.

Excellent! I was almost deterred by the long list of ingredients but it's TOTALLY WORTH IT. The fats balance nicely for the perfect combination of flaky/crispy/chewy and it isn't overly buttery tasting (or worse, like straight up shortening).

Just to add to some of the comments. Making dough will always very depending on the humidity in your home. For this reason making a pie dough in Florida is very different than making one in Arizona ;) add the liquid slowly, it should just hold together. If it's sticky through it out and start again!

Oh my, this is my go-to recipe for pie crust from now on!  I've always been known for my pies, but this really steps it up a notch.  Melt-in-your-mouth buttery, flaky... it's definitely the best I've ever tried.  And using the food processor makes it a snap... how come I didn't ever think of that?! I followed the recipe exactly, but here are a my tips (many of which came from previous reviewers):
     *You can make your own cake flour by using 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, taking out 1 1/2 tbsp and replacing it with 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch, and then sifting 5-6 times.  Works perfectly :)
     *I use organic unsalted butter.  I just think it makes a flakier, better tasting crust.
     *I hardly ever need to use more than 4-5 tbsp of the water/vinegar/egg yolk mixture.  You don't want your dough too wet.  Handle the dough as little as possible.
     *Rolling out the dough between layers of plastic wrap or waxed paper is the way to go.  Be careful to roll it out evenly, and not too thickly, however.  You want a light crust that's not too heavy.  This recipe makes quite a bit of dough, enough for a very large deep-dish pie.  If you're using a smaller pie tin, decrease the amount of dough you try to roll.  When making a two-crust pie, I make 1 1/2 recipes and it's plenty.
     *Definitely refrigerate the pie crust for 30-40 minutes after you've rolled it and molded it into the pie plate. As others have noted, this reduces shrinkage.
      Perfection!!!

Enjoy

This was my first time making a pie crust from scratch and I chose this review based on the other reviews left here.  I followed the directions exactly as listed above - The flavor was delicious.  I think I personally need a little practice getting the right texture and not making as big of a mess in the kitchen, but I think the recipe itself was fantastic.  Thanks!

4 stars because....too much butter/shortening for myself. I doubled recipe but 1/2 C each of butter and shortening. I did freeze both in cubes and used my K/A stand mixer. I made sure not to over mix & wrapped dough in plastic wrap and let it sit in fridge for an hour. Then I allowed the crust to sit  in room temp for 15 minutes b4 trying to roll out. It was fine. I've discovered when dough is cold it doesn't roll out as easily. Once rolled out I allowed pie crust to chill in pie pan before pre baking so it wouldn't shrink up as much. Anyway, reducing the fat a bit and mixing in the wet a Tblsp at a time, worked for me! I have such a difficult time with pie crust but this one worked out with my slight changes. Oh and I used all AP flour, didn't have any cake flour.

THE best pie crust for a cook whom struggled with pie crust. This one comes out perfect! I used all regular flour, but am sure an added element could be had by halfing it with cake flour. Also, my crust did not take all of the yolk, vinegar, water mixture. I followed the instructions for 5 TBS at a time and that was a perfect tip to not "over water" the crust.

I have been using this pie crust recipe (or one similar) for years and love it! I feel like it has lots of flavor and really enhances whatever pie filling you use it with. My one bit of advice (I use a pastry blender, not a food processor) is to make sure that your "chunks" of dough aren't too large prior to adding liquid. If they are I feel that it is sticky and ugly when rolled out.

Doubled it, used Earth Balance shortening, and whole wheat flour instead of  all-purpose for chicken pot pie, and WOW--thick, great, copious crust.  I rolled it pretty thick since the dough was so cold, and I had way more than I need.  And thanks to the shortening, the crust is just as good the second day, even after refrigeration, as it was the first.

I love this crust, have looked for crusts that include baking soda and vinegar, this is it. I used reviewer "Mindy W"'s tip, using saran wrap when rolling it out, but I sprinkled 1-2 Tablespoons of flour on the top and bottom, to be safe. I thank CAROLEALANA for submitting this recipe, (which is now in my RECIPE BOX)

Every year at Thanksgiving I strive to produce the best Apple Pie with a Flaky Crust. If you haven't tried this recipe your missing out on the best tasting, the most flaky, firm yet, soft like butter, to put your fork into and then melts into this desirable urge to have more. Yes, it took a few steps more to produce this wonderful crust, but I guarantee you will not regret this recipe. I wish it was my own, I don't think I would give it to just anyone. I'm pushing 60 real quick and this was the best year of my life for compliments on my pies.  Just remember, keep your dough as cool as you can, rest it in the freezer for 20 min or so. Believe me you will be the talk of the neighborhood.

I am giving this recipe a 5 because it taste so good. I think some of the problems I had was due to inexperience. I had problems with it crumbling too much. If you tried to wrap it in foil it fell apart. I used butter flavored Crisco sticks because it is so much easier to measure. I used the distilled white vinegar and it didn't have a bitter wangy taste.

I thought this recipe was very good. The only thing is that it was a little labor intensive. Note that if you do not have a food processor you can use a blender, pastry cutter, or a fork (but the fork requires a lot more work).

I didn't have cake flour or vinegar, but this crust still turned out the best I've ever made.  It was flaky and flavorful.  Used it for three types of pies.  This will be the crust I'll be using from now on.  Just perfect.

It's been a VERY long time since I've tried to make a homemade pie crust.  After tasting this pie crust - I will NEVER buy another storebought pie crust.  Very quick & easy to make.

Best pie crust I (or anyone I know) has ever had.  I make peach-apple pies in this crust for every dinner party or other event I'm invited to and there are never left overs.  I get asked for the recipe ALL the time. FINALLY, a pie crust recipe that lives up to our expectations!

This was my first attempt at a homemade crust. I don't have a food processor, so I thought it would fail. I'm making pies for Thanksgiving, but I wanted to make sure I could make this crust first, so I tried it out today with a pecan pie. Now, I love pecan pie, so I think I'd like it on anything, but I loved this crust. I really thought it wouldn't turn out right since I had to use a mixer and it took a while, but it really did turn out well, and I will use it again.

Worth the work!!! I used butter for the whole recipe instead of 1/2 shortening and only used about 5 tablespoons of the vinegar, egg, water mix. Turned out great.

I tried this recipe for the first time last christmas.  It turned out so well!  I use it for fruit pies, and for quiche as well.  It is so flaky.  I didn't find it hard to make, but I don't think it would turn out as well or be as easy to make without a food processor.  Thank you for the recipe.  It is the only one I use!

This recipe does take a bit more work than other crusts, but it's worth it. I used some of the left-over crust strips to make pie-crust treats, and they went lightning fast. The crust also doesn't stick to the pan. Take care not to add too much of the liquid, or it gets too wet fast.

I made this crust to go with the Caramel Pecan Pie that I was making for Thanksgiving.  It was flaky and had a great taste.  It takes a little while to make but it is well worth the time and effort.

WOW! What an awesome crust! I have not been a big fan of making pie crusts, but this recipe has changed that. This crust was so easy and came out perfectly. It would be hard to have this crust come out badly. A++++

This was a great recipe.  It is no harder than any other pie crust recipe. I think some have had a hard time rolling it out due to adding too much of the egg mixture.  I loved the taste and the flakiness.  I can't wait to use it during the holidays.  Thanks!

I was very disappointed in this crust. It didn't make enough so I had to roll it very thin, it crumbled (not flaked) easily so the crust just crumbled right off and the flavor left a lot to be desired. I'm going back to my old favorite.

Makes a delicious crust, but takes some work.  Made a double batch; used half right away and left the other in the freezer for a week...still was fresh.  Found it a little difficult to roll out, so probably wouldn't use it for pies requiring a top crust.  Great recipe overall!

Because of the great reviews of this recipe, I chose to try to make my first pie crust with it.  Wow!  It turned out great and it was fairly simple.  It doesn't even compare to the ready-made crust Pilsbury puts out.  Thank you for your help!

Excellent recipe!  I made a banana cream pie and it turned out just great.  My only question is, how long and at what temp. do you bake it?  I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes.  I searched the recipe for the proper temp. and time and thought I was missing something, but it wasn't there.  What do you recommend?

I have a fettish about good pie crusts.  A wonderful filling cannot compensate for a poor crust.  I have cookbooks from all top bakers, no recipe I have used compares to this one.  Thanks a million!!

I love to bake but after several unsuccessful attempts at pie crusts I thought I gave up.  Because I had an extra can of cherry pie filling I thought I would try again.  Voila!  This is the best pie crust I have ever tasted.  My husband said it was even better than Marie Calendar's.  Thanks so much for this posting, I am now the "Pie Queen"!

I loved this recipe.  It was by far the easiest since you can do most of the blending in the processor and the flavor is great.  Excellent!

I don't know what I did wrong, so many positive reviews but a major fail for me.  I did use almond flour so maybe that was the problem.  I was very happy with my pea-sized pieces and added all the liquid and it does say it is a wet dough.  Put in the in the frig and when I took it out, it was still too wet, added over a cup of regular flour so I could roll it out.  I could see the pieces of butter in the dough and hoped for the best, but it was tasteless.

I always have trouble with pie crust, but the recipe is simple and my family loves it! I used it with lemon meringue pie and it was amazing.

if you don’t own a food processor but have a kitchen aid mixer (like me), just pulse it on and off with the mixer turning to 2 and it ends up great :) besides that, this pie crust tastes incredible and is super duper easy

Been making pies for 60 years so I base the following comment on my experience. This is a very good pie crust recipe however the liquids are about double what is actually needed. As she says, you do not want a sloppy wet dough so don’t add more of the liquids than you need to bring it all together.  Some areas of the Country have dryer climate which can make their flour drier, in which case you might need a bit more liquid.  Use a fork to toss the liquid into the flour mixture a little at a time till you can judge the right texture.

Im not good at making pie crusts yet. I did follow the instructions but not being very experienced I found them to be a tad ambiguous when adding the egg yolk mix. I mean, at least say what Im shooting for besides dont overmix or make too wet (how will I know until its too late?). I used 4.5tbsp and the pie crust seemed dry and crumbly after baking. A bit late to find that out. The taste of the crust was good but I really wanted a crust that was tender and held together. I guess I will have to keep practicing. Either way, -1 star for ambiguous instructions.

This crust is amazing!  I have tried to make pie crust for 40 years! This has that flaky texture!  Hubby even commented that this was way better than any of the last pies I made! 
My  old electric processor did not work well with it though.  I put it in a large glass bowl and used knives to cut through the flour/butter/Crisco.  I had to make the cake flour.  Removed 2 tablespoons of flour and replaced with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch per cup. I like to roll out crust between two sheets of parchment paper.

Wow and Wow! Theeee most flakey, tender crust evvvvv-rrrrr! Time consuming, a bit of a pain, but so worth it! I chilled in fridge, chilled in freezer like one reviewer suggested. I used it for a small chicken pot pie. Top and bottom crust. Absolutely outstanding. I'll make it again in a few days for my Christmas pumpkin pie. I have a hand food processor and it worked great. My Father was a real critic of pie crusts, and I know he'd have been blown away with this. Sure wish I could have shown him.......

I used 1 tsp of white vinegar because I didn't have distilled vinegar. In my case I didn't need to add all of the egg yolk mixture, and it still turned out amazing. I used this for a fruit pie with a creamy filling, so I  brushed the bottom with egg before baking to prevent it from getting too soggy.

This was almost impossible for me to roll out.  It kept cracking while i was rolling it and could not even put it into the pie plate.  It just cracked to pieces.  I used the 5T of liquid.  It didn't seem too dry.  Don't know what happened.

I've been making pies for 20 years and this is my recipe now. It is delicious. Flaky tender  with crispy edges. Yum. Perfect compliment to my apple pies. Brought some to work and coworkers were making mmmm noises and telling me they were gonna lick their plates. So good.

My husband hates sour cream so I diverted from my mom's crust recipe to this one. I think the vinegar replaces the source cream my mom usually uses. All in all a very flavorful pie crust, but a little more work than my mom's recipe. Still, I will use this again - and my husband absolutely LOVED it :)

My crust came out absolutely delicious. Very flaky and buttery. Was not "wet" as some of the post read. I used it to make peach cobbler including the dumplings. The cobbler was was truly delicious. The only negative was when you change the servings of the recipie, the amount of liquid you add in the actual recipie does does change. I wasn't sure what the initial serving was so I had to estimate how much liquid to add. I think I used 10 tbs for a 20 serving pie as I was making a top and bottom crust and dumplings.

I tried to double the recipe for making a 2-crust pie.
It was extremely frustrating to follow. I am a novice at baking, so maybe I did not understand how to do this right. The end result was worthless. I will not be using the recipe again.

Excellent!  I've never had luck with pie crusts before but this one worked out perfect!  You need to follow the directions perfectly...sprinkle water, egg, vinegar mixture...don't pour.  Do not over mix....It turned out wonderful...will use this again and again!  Thank you for posting!

Today I used the store brand 'ready to unroll and bake' type pie crust and realized I should have taken the time to make this crust again, like I did this past thanksgiving...but I was lazy.  What a sad little crust...next time I'll come back to this recipe or just not make a pie at all!  Baker's Secret Pie Crust comes out so wonderful and you'll savor every bite and NOT be let down.

Perfect crust, even at high altitude! (7100 feet) This was the first pie I have ever made, and it was surprisingly easy.  I didn't have to make any adjustments, and it was absolutely delicious.  I used the hint about rolling the crust between pieces of Saran wrap and it worked like a charm.  I made Grandma Ople's apple pie for the filling and a crumb crust for the topping..delicious!

I wanted a crumbly crust like Marie Callenders banana cream pie. This recipe did not disappoint. The water amount, I've found, is way off. I've made this crust at least 5 times and I never use even close to the full amount of water and I live in dry Colorado, so add just enough liquid to make the dough just clump together. The vinegar and egg yolk must do something to the texture and flavor making it excellent, and different from other crusts. It is hard to work with, so chill the dough overnight for easier handling, roll on floured surface, or press into the pie pan works fine too.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I was a bit confused by the part of the recipe when you mix egg with vinegar and then measure some of that back in to the recipe tablespoons at a time. I almost made a major error there. I was worried after the dough was mixed because it was really wet. But I wrapped it in plastic wrap and refrigerated it. I didn't end up rolling it out for several hours later. I heavily floured my surface, floured my hands, floured the rolling pin and it all worked out. I used the crust in a chicken pot pie. OH MY GOODNESS! It was absolutely the best crust I have ever made. Light, flaky, crispy, held together, tasted awesome! The tiny hint of vinegar really worked. I can't wait to try the crust recipe on a fruit pie or pecan.

This is by far the best pastry I have made.  The dough was easy to roll out and was nice and flaky!  This is now my pastry recipe of choice!  Thanks for sharing.

So many ingredients! The tip on vinegar and egg yolk makes it worthwhile, though. Since I didn't have cake flour, I found out how to convert regular flour into cake flour, too. Then I used the leftover vinegar/egg yolk/water when making Mom's Pie Crust on this website. Both Baker's Secret and Mom's turned out great - both were "my best" crusts yet. There's one in the freezer waiting to impress me all over again. And I can't wait to make more. My friend who was a pastry chef for years told me to not let anyone tell me I'm not a pie maker. Then she had another piece of pumpkin pie. Thank you to Carolealana and Debra Shapiro for both of these recipes.

A double OMG on this pie crust. Everyone raves about it and Carolealana deserves the rave reviews.  I've never heard of using egg or vinegar to wet the dough but it works like a miracle.  I made a cherry pie at 2am last night and the pie didn't last 24 hours, for a family of . . .  2.  Me and my husband could not get enough pie crust!  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you Carole, thank you, thank you.  I will use this recipe the rest of my life, I will hand it down to my kids, and I'm sure they will hand it down to theirs!  OMG.

This is an exceptionally good recipe. The crust turns out flaky but not oily. I think the vinegar makes the trick and I accidentally added 1 tbsp of sugar instead , it still turns out well. Very good .

I must say that this was the most frustrating pie crust recipe I have ever used and I have made several kinds.  I made as directed but could not get the crust to roll out.  It would break apart every time I tried and I kept putting it in the refrigerator or freezer to make sure it was cold.  I finally put it in the pie plate and pushed it down with my fingers and that worked fine, though I didn't get the pretty edge I was wanting.  The bad thing was I quadrupled this recipe because I plan to make more pies this week to give away.  Now, I may have to make a different recipe for my give away pies.  : (

Thank you so kindly for sharing your wonderful recipe.  For years I have made my pastry crust with just shortening and it was very good--flaky, pesentable but not as flavorable as those made with butter.  But this recipe is everything a pastry crust should be--flaky, delicious and beautiful.  I have been making it with 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 K.A. unbleached all-purpose flour as I did not have cake flour on hand and I used a little bit less water.  But other than those minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly with great success.  Right now, I have just made a double batch to do some English baking--treacle tart, and lemon and raspberry tarts.  This pastry is just perfect for these!!! Again, I thank you for sharing!!

I used this recipe to make an Apple Pie for my 1st Thanksgiving with my husband. Although it was more work than traditional crust recipes, it was worth it. This crust is DELICIOUS. Thanks so much for sharing!

This crust melted in your mouth. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I didn't even come close to using the amount of liquid called for. I only used a little under half, so make sure you very slowly add the liquid to ensure the perfect crust!

I didn't use cake flour, I didn't have any.  So, just used regular flour.  I used lard not vegetable shortening along with butter.  I have to say this rolled out so nice.  And it didn't shrink like lots of other pie crust recipes.  This is the best pie crust ever.  I made three pies yesterday and will be making 2 more today for Thanksgiving. Definetely a five star recipe.

This was the first time I made a pie crust from scratch and its REALLY good! I followed everything exact except i didn't have any cake flower so I used regular flour. We only use White lily so I did have a good quality flour. I took the advice from another reviewer and put it back in the fridge after forming it into a pie plate. Once i baked it, it shrunk a little, but i believe it was my fault. I made a chocolate pie with this crust and brushed the crust with egg wash and sprinkled a tad of sugar on it....I will keep using the recipe until i get it perfect! thanks!

Good, good, good! Though I think the liquid amount should be reduced or explained better. Mine came out pretty wet. (I am a first time crust maker) I had so much liquid per the recipe, as I was adding, I guess I got overly secure and should have added it more slowly, only as needed. It was still awesome, after refrigerating overnight, and a little extra flour when rolling. The flavor was very tasty! I cannot wait to try again!

This crust was excellent.  Very flaky and buttery.  Too bad my apple filling didn't quite cook all the way.  I was ticked - the filling didn't deserve the crust!  And after all that hard work!!!

I've tried a bunch of pie crusts and this one is the best I've found so far. It's not nearly has heavy as a lard crust and has a lot more substance than just a shortening crust. It rolls beautifully too. I had no problems with sticking or breaking.  I do not use all of the water mixture.  I use just as much as I need, which changes so an exact measurement cannot be given.  I do not recommend dumping all the liquid in at once, but gradually until you're sure it's moist enough.  I often make the crust the night before which makes it very easy to handle I'll be using this recipe again soon!

Great pie crust.  I usually use the Longaberger recipe, but decided to try this one because it's similar.  The main difference is the addition of cake flour.  I'm not sure if it's the cake flour or not that did it, but it was delicious, flaky and very easy to handle.  Rave reviews from my family who can usually tell when I've tried a new recipe.

GREAT!! This was my biggest fear of trying. But on my 2nd try(1st one was to watery,kids helped) it was great. I didnt have a food proccesor, so I just used a spoon like I read on the sugg. Plus I only used 4 ices and pulled them out when the started to melt, then I put the liquid in the frig till needed, this helped from it becoming to watery. Its a KEEPER!!

I replaced the shortening with extra-virgin coconut oil and the crust came out SO flakey! It was melt-in-your-mouth YUMMY! I highly recommend this recipe for most pies. :)

I think it's great.  Today was the second time I used it (for a cherry tart recipe), and it was delicious.  The first time I used it for an egg custard recipe and we hated the egg custard, but we loved the crust!  I think the secret is vinegar, and I used rice vinegar since I don't have white.  If you cook a lot I suggest getting a huge magimix/food processor with a kneading blade and dough hook.  That's what I used for this recipe and I just dumped everything together and it still came out great.  I used this recipe for tarts, even though it says for pies.

I'm not sure it's entirely worth all the effort, but this crust did turn out as flaky and delicious as other reviewers say....I think it "saved" my rather tart pie in the end. The cake flour makes a difference (not a huge difference, mind you, but a difference nonetheless). I didn't have a large enough food processor, so I cut in the shortening and butter with forks as suggested by other reviewers. I did find I had to cook the pie a little longer than usual in order for the crust to cook all the way through, but this may just be my oven, so I could only suggest keeping an eye on it.

This is excellent pie crust. I have used this recipe several times, and every single time it turned out perfectly. The consistency makes it easy to flute the edges and it tastes great.

I had high hopes for this pie crust given the great reviews, but it didn't work for me.  I don't have a food processor, so I had to do everything with a pastry blender.  It looked okay going into the oven (I needed a pre-baked crust), but it shrank and looked like a disaster when it came out of the oven.  (Perhaps the pie crust shrinkage was probably my fault?) I was disappointed with the taste/texture as well -- once again didn't meet my expectations based on the reviews.  Will go back to my good ol' Betty Crocker standard pie crust!

Didn't like the taste so much.
This recipe is way too time consuming for me.
I prefer a more 'basic' crust.

I love this pie crust! It's pretty time consuming but sooo worth it. I've used this recipe three times so far. Once with the Glazed Apple Cream Pie, another time with some little strawberry mini pies, and tonight with Tomato Pie II. Each time has been dee-licious! Thanks for sharing =)

I was never a fan of pie crust because it was either too buttery or greasy for me.  This recipe is wonderful.  I could just bake the crust and eat it plain.

I must say that this was the best recipe I have ever tasted.  I was a bit leary of the vinegar, but it was SO GOOD!!  My family raved about it and it disappeared within minutes at Thanksgiving.  They are looking forward to having it again at Christmas!
I didn't have a food processor either, so I used a pastry cutter and it worked fine.
I will never use ready made crusts again!

This was great!  I didn't have any cake flour..so followed substitution list suggestion and simply used 2Tbs.less all purpose flour.  Results were wonderful!  Made an awesome sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving.

I made three crusts and I don't know if it was the way that crust was supposed to turn out or maybe I made it too thick but it seemed a bit raw in the center.  I would not make it again.

WOW! What a fabulous pie crust recipie. I have always had a knack for good pie crust and needless to say the one asked to bring the pies for family feasts. However at this last one my mother absolutely flipped at how good it was this time, and my husband, who could eat pie crust and nothing else, loves it too.

Different than your normal pie crust. Not bad, you can definitely taste the cake flour in this. I made this with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and everyone thought it was great! My sister rants and raves about this. Everyone looks forward to me making my homemade pies.

WOW! I tried this last night for an apple pie. I have to say it is the best crust I've ever had. The crust is really easy to work with too. For Fall when I make my apple pie, instead of use a whole top crust I make cut outs of Fall leaves and put on top of my pie. It turned out wonderful, and tastes scrumptous!!!!

Very good crust, but a little hard to roll out.  I guess I can't expect it to be like pilsbury.  Other than that a very tasty, flaky crust. (Used with peach/blueberry pie).

fabulous crust.  the best ever.  i love to cook and to bake and have been using the pillsbury ready crust for years.  half of me wanted this to not work so that i could keep on taking the easy way out.  the other half of me wanted this to be a wonderful crust.  it was wonderful and i will never buy a ready made crust again.  the review with the food processer-less people was especially helpful.

Fantastic!  This is a perfect pie crust.  It is more work and uses more ingredients than any I've made before, but definitely worth the effort.  Very flaky and delicious.  This will be my standard pie crust recipe from now on.

absolutely FABULOUS.  i, too, have had trouble with pie crusts -- they were usually more useful as doorstops. this recipe comes out with a flakiness worthy of any professional baker.  it's NOT easy, and it requires time and patience, but the results are SO worth it!  (btw: use cider or red wine vinegar for a kick to meat or apple pies).
