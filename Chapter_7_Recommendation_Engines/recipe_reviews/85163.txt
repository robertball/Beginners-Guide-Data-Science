My husband requested oysters for his birthday dinner...we had them raw, in pasta, and in this recipe.  This was our favorite!  Bar-b-queing the oysters also made shucking much easier.

Amazingly addictive!!  N1COLE nailed it!!  But I wanted to add some grilling tips for people who have never tried this before.  When you look at an oyster shell, you will see that one side is more of a bowl shape and the other side is flatter.  Cook them with the bowl shape down to keep in more moisture and avoid shoe leather.  Oysters  will sometimes "explode" and rapidly vent steam when they first pop open on the grill so be careful where you put your fingers and face when you first start cooking them.  They will not "open up" like clams do either.  You should see a space just large enough to easily slide a knife into and that's usually about it.  Maybe only 1/4" or so.  They cook very quickly once they open, so keep watch and take them off fast - listen for the sizzle.  Use a heavy glove or thick towel to protect you from the heat, sharp shells, and bubbling liquid when taking off the top shell.  If you are brand new to grilling these, do them one at a time until you figure out the timing to suit your taste buds (rare, medium, well done, etc) before loading up the grill and potentially ruining a whole batch.  Then be prepared to feed your new addiction because these are amazing!!

These are great. This was my first time grilling oysters so I was a bit leary. They turned out great.

This was my first time at making oysters, and they turned out pretty tasty. I used the oven since the BBQ was rained out. I cooked the oysters at 450 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until they cracked open. I also omitted the hot sauce since I am a wimp. Yum!

I've been looking forward to making this recipe as I love oysters.
I bought a dozen this morning and just finished eating the first 4...The grilling seemed to add grit or pieces of shell to the meat area. The lemon juice / worchestershire was just OK.

Pretty darn good! I made BBQ oysters for the first time using this recipe omitting the worchestershire sauce. It was yummy!

May have over cooked but they dried out and sauce could be improved.
