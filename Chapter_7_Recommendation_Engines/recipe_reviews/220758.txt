This salad/dip is great for picnics or any time you'll be eating outdoors - nothing spoils. We ate this with smoked brisket and potato salad recently. So good!

Oh so easy but light and tasty!  Served with lobster and hush puppies for a New Years treat.

Good but seems to be missing something. From experimentation, a 3&1/2" long jalapeno (seeded and medium diced) will add flavor without any noticeable heat. (Note to myself - decrease corn to 1 cup frozen) Refrigerate overnight for flavors to meld. I like it with chips.

Nice flavor. We prefer using it as a relish over steamed fish or as a salsa for chips. I didn't change anything and was happy to see a recipe that needed what are normal pantry staples to me.

Pretty good recipe for the use of black eyed peas, but it's a little too much garlic for our liking. I'd recommend starting with one clove and adding more if you wish.
