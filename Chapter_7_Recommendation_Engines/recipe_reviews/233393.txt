I am the submitter of this recipe and I’m delighted that you are enjoying it.  I wanted to point out that AR changed my recipe when they published it.  You will definitely need more than one teaspoon of oil to coat your pan otherwise your potatoes will likely stick.  First spray your pan with non-stick cooking spray and then pour in enough oil to coat the pan.  When I make these I make half of this recipe in a 10" cast iron skillet.   Even though I don't measure,  I'd say I use about one tablespoon of oil to coat my pan.  I hope this helps.

Very good. A trick I learned from a friend years ago, if you parboil your potatoes for just a few minutes you will yield a crispier roasted potato.

I was looking for a new recipe for roasted red potatoes and I couldn't be more pleased with this one.  I used about a tablespoon of oil to coat the baking pan.  I chopped the potatoes (husband's personal preference) and simply mixed with the cheese and spices, and spread onto baking pan.  Per the instructions, I roasted for 20 minutes, stirred them and continued roasting for additional 20 minutes.  They were absolutely delicious and we all (4) enjoyed them!  This was an easy, enjoyable recipe that I will be making again!

Loved it Bellepepper. All my daughter's favorites and she is a potato girl. I saw on another recipe (and it works) that if you blast the potatoes at 450 degrees for 20 mintues and then turn down stove to 350 degrees for the next 15 -20 minutes, you get a nice crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, roasted potato. I also spray my pans/oil my pans, dump the pototoes and whatever seasonings in the pan and toss the potatoes around it in it. Potatoes never stick,you never lose any of the seasonings and one less bowl to wash.

Very good.  Recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, but needed significantly more for 2 pounds of potatoes.  NOTE:  Ensure you coat the bottom of your pan with enough oil to prevent the potatoes from sticking or you will lose the crusty goodness of this dish!  Enjoy!

I tried these and they were not so good. The cheese burnt before the potatoes were done. If you notice, in the pictures, the potatoes are sliced not just cut in half. Maybe I will try doing them that way.

These were amazing!!  I used white potatoes, sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray, put one tablespoon of cooking oil on the cookie sheet, sliced my potatoes (I used 4 potatoes) in quarter slices, drizzled them with the cooking oil, and then instead of tossing the seasoning/cheese mix with them in the bowl, I spooned a about a 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture directly on the cut side of the potato and spread it around before placing them cut side down on the cookie sheet.  For me this was a lot easier and ensured that they had a nice thick coating on them because when I tried tossing it with them in the bowl the mixture didn't stick well.  I roasted them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes and flipped them and cooked them for another 15 minutes.  They turned out beautifully browned and crispy and soft and delicious on the inside.  Next time I will decrease the salt a bit because they were a tad bit too salty but the sour cream that we dipped them in helped out with that problem.  Oh and I also doubled the seasoning/cheese mixture since the amount in the recipe was not enough probably since my potatoes were quartered instead of just cut in half.  I will make this recipe again and again.  My kids loved them and my son was disappointed when he saw that there weren't any leftovers.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe Bellepepper!!  :)

Everybody loved these delicious potatoes and they are a quick easy recipe. They did turn out just as the recipe stated crispy on the outside, yet creamy on the inside. I used red potatoes and doubled the batch since we had guest for dinner.  Perfect side for grilled burgers.  Thanks Bellepepper. Update: We tried this on the gas grill over indirect heat, used our rectangle stoneware, baked 40 minutes and didn't even need to turn them over. Keeps from heating the house up on hot days.

I love this recipe. it works Perfect for us!  I made just a few changes to our taste.  1) as per other reviewers I sauteed the onion. 2) I layered the potatoes and sprinkled each layer with salt, pepper, and onion. then poured the cheese sauce over it.  I cut the butter back by 1 tablespoon and the liquid back by about milk cup and added more cheese as per our taste.  I made this sauce as written the first time and it was good, but the changes I made were for again Our taste.  I love love love this recipe.  I have made it twice now and it is my new Au Gratin Dish.  will be no more boxes here.  this is too easy, quick and cheap considering we always have all of these ingredients in the house.  thank you so much for sharing your Perfect and adaptable dish with us.

These are FANTASTIC! My family would eat them every night if I made them. I chunk up the potatoes in the morning and cover them with water until I'm ready to use them. It removes the starch from the potatoes and insures that the inside will be soft with a crunchy outside. After draining and dying them I put them in a gallon freezer bag and drizzled in the oil to coat, then dipped them in the parm. mixture. I lined the baking pan with parchment paper which made clean up a breeze! Started them out on 350 degrees and finished them on 400. They were AMAZING!!!

If you want a beautifully encrusted parmesan potato, tender and delicious, this is your recipe! It was agreed these beat out the potatoes I normally roast and have to fuss over. I always use an iron skillet and heat it up prior to putting the potatoes in the skillet and I often use garlic infused oil. I also roast these on the grill quite often. Thanks, Belle, these are amazing and the sour cream is a nice touch!!

So yummy, thanks for the recipe bellepepper! I made half a recipe in my favorite cast iron pan :) I used the smallest red potatoes in my bag (can't believe the size variations I got in this batch!), and still wished for more crispy cut edges, so next time I might go quarters. I used my convection oven, set 25 degrees lower per manufacturers instructions. Lovely brown deliciousness! I seasoned my sour cream with seasoned salt, garlic powder and parsley because it was a special occasion :) This recipe needs no tweaking in my opinion, thanks again for sharing! Update: Made these again, this time I used regular potatoes and they were a perfect side to my 'breakfast for dinner' :)

This is a 5 star recipe!  So easy to prepare!  I used regular medium-sized potatoes, baked in the oven for 40 minutes in a cast iron skillet and sprinkled with additional parsley and parmesan cheese when I removed from the oven. Thanks bellepepper for sharing your  recipe.  I made this recipe for the first time on September 12, 2011 and several times since.  So glad AR finally kitchen approved it!

bellepepper, you have an easy recipe that is simply delicious and fits into a healthy eating plan as well.  So I thank you for that.  I used russet potatoes since that is what I had on hand and cooking spray instead of oil.  They turned out just like your picture and like you described, crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  The potatoes went really well with Marianne's Pork Medallions with Balsamic Vinegar and Capers recipe as well as the Spiced Marinated Tomatoes recipe from Cooking Light's June 2006 magazine.  This has become my go to recipe for roasted potatoes.

These were absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! My 24 year old daughter prepared these while I tended to the rest of dinner. All of my dinner guests were oohing and aahing over these potatoes all evening. The flavor was perfect! This recipe is a definite keeper for my recipe box!! Thanks

Our potatoes were delicious and we enjoyed them very much!  I used the exact measurements of the cheese and seasonings but did have to use russet potatoes because that is all I had.  I do believe they would have been even better with the red potatoes.  I put all of my seasonings in the bowl, mixed that up, then I added the cut potatoes on top of that, drizzled the oil over top of the potatoes and mixed everything up.  Potatoes were coated just fine with the amount of cheese & seasonings that I'd measured out.  I placed the potatoes on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper and turned them over after 15 minutes.  I will add that my oven has a convection feature that I did turn on and my potatoes were perfectly brown & crispy after about 30 minutes.  I will not hesitate to make these again.

I followed the recipe as written, baked on a cast iron skillet and my potatoes were not crispy. They were like a baked potato, just as some other reviewers stated. I also think they needed more seasonings, salt especially.

Absolutely wonderful - I used 1  pound of red potatoes and with the exception of using 1/4 tsp of salt kept everything else as stated in the recipe.  I cooked them in a cast iron skillet in a 400 degree oven and they came out perfect.  Thank you Bellpepper!!

Very good. But ended up with potatoes less crispy than I was expecting...more like a baked potato than roasted.  Still my bible study group inhaled it!

Love these! They are a favorite now.  I only added rosemary to the mix.  That was my only change and they are awesome! 
The key to the crispy outside is blotting  the potatoes before you coat them. Getting that moisture off the cut potato really makes a BIG difference. So don't skip that step if you want the outside to be crisp.

These are my go-to potatoes.  I've made them several times using baby red potatoes and the cooking method is spot on.  They always brown nicely on the cut sides, are soft and creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  The seasonings as listed in the recipe are a tiny bit sparse for my liking so I simply double them and also add 1 tsp of Herbs De Provence and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little extra flavor.  I do have issues with the seasoning sticking to the potatoes just by tossing them but nothing that can't be solved simply by pressing the cut side of each tater down into the seasoning and cheese that sticks to the side and bottom of the mixing bowl
Thanks for sharing!

I made some changes, but not many - I used a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper, and sliced the potatoes into coins instead of halving (our potatoes were a little too big to just halve).  Also, I used white pepper instead of black.  These were DELICIOUS - crispy and creamy, just the recipe says!  We will definitely be making these again.

Great recipe! Delicious! I had white potatoes, and kept the recipe exactly, used a tablespoon of olive oil as others suggested, used Imported Italian Reggiano parmessan, eat some hot off the oven and some room temperature I liked them cooled even better... Addictive! I used my small electric oven, to save energy and they came out perfect, they did not burn I cooked them about 8 minuts extra at 450 .... It's a keeper!

I made this as directed, cut in half, and they were done at the same time the cheese was done.   I did choose smaller potatoes because I hate peeling those little buggers, so I saved the big ones for that.   I was a little disappointed that when I went to flip the taters, that they were sticking to the sheet.   I didn't think that would be an issue with how well they were coated with oil.   Excellent way to prepare potatoes.

These potatoes are absolutely delicious - and beautiful looking, too! This recipe has the perfect amount of parmesan and seasoning and the cooking time was right on. I used Yukon gold potatoes and had to quarter some of them... they worked just fine. This will be my go to roasted potato recipe from now on, for sure! Thank you for this recipe, Bellepepper.

This was delicious.  My husband loved it and he's usually a meat and PLAIN potato person.  I used more Parmesan than called for, though.  Oh, I used a cookie sheet with low sides on it and they stuck like mad.

Loved these!  I cut the potatoes in slices and added more oil into the pan than called for and baked.  Without enough oil mine would stick to the pan. 

The second time I made these I was in a hurry so I microwaved my potatoes till they were half cooked then sliced (with skin), coated and baked.  I think they tasted even better and were in the oven half as long.  I used regular Idaho potatoes.   Great flavor!

Absolutely they best recipe for roasted potatoes. Only thing I did different was quarters the potatoes (personal preference) and used smoked paprika. The smoky flavor of the paprika was the star of the dish. Family and friends loved it.

I used gal bags to  toss potato with olive oil and let is soak in.  Also cooked on parchment paper.  No need for cooking spray on pan.  Added more garlic ( I enjoy a lot of garlic) and less salt.  Turned out great to reheat.  Did not shrink, wrinkle up as a leftover. Great recipe.  Will make again.

I think I used close to 2lbs of potatoes, not sure as I didn't weight them. I quartered them.
Used 3 T of Parmesan, extra garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika. I also added dried thyme and basil.
It was a little more than 1 layer of potatoes in 9x13 pan

Crunchy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. I didn’t have Parmesan cheese this time so I finely grated some marble cheese.  It was yummy. I have made this a few times and enjoy each time.

Excellent!  I used peeled russet potatoes, cut into wedges.  Doubled the parmesan to 4 tbsp( did not have fresh grated), and lined a pan with tin foil for easy clean up.  Excellent reheated in microwave with sour cream!

This was good as a base recipe, but I was much more liberal with the ingredients. I added considerably more cheese and seasonings, swapped olive oil and butter instead of vegetable oil (and more of them than the recipe suggested), and included crushed red pepper. I also simply stirred the potatoes in the pan at the halfway mark, rather than turning them over (which is tedious and doesn't really help the recipe). I suspect these will be even better as I fine-tune the ingredients.

I sliced the potatoes and cooked 20 minutes on one side and 15 minutes on the other side and they were perfect. Of course when you slice them you need a lot more parmesan cheese, I used about a quarter cup and upped all the other ingredients to cover both sides of the poatatoes.

Very good flavor!  I'm dreaming of when to make them next.  :)  I stuck to the recipe aside from adding rosemary, since I had it growing in the herb box!  Awesome combo.  I'll definitely make these again.

So crispy and delish. I tossed them in olive oil, then combined all the ingredients in a ziploc and shook them up. Perfect side for anything! Thank you!

Very good flavor. I was a little inconsistent in cutting my potatoes so some did not get completely done. Cook's fault on that one!!

I have made this a couple of times now and my family just loves these potatoes.  Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is that it needs much more cheese.  I also slice the potatoes instead of halving them.  Great recipe!

Very nice...now I need to get a Pork Tenderloin. I pretty much followed the recipe, which is unusual for me. I quartered the red potatoes and probably used a little more olive oil than called for (like it better than other oils for this recipe), so I turned more often to roast on all cut edges. Ended up cooking it for at least 30 minutes. Sure don't need to skin it first. Like someone said...kind of a creamy inside. I like to use a little Garlic Granules from World Spice , maybe some diced fresh garlic and Rosemary goes so well w/ these and I forgot the paprika (oops...though didn't need it per se).

These potatoes turned out amazing!!  I loved them and will definitely use this as my go-to red potato recipe from now on. Only thing I added was a little oregano while the potatoes were baking. So yummy.

Made this for a family dinner and everyone loved how brown and flavorful the potatoes were.  Don't cut too small so you get lots of tenderness on the inside and crispiness on the outside

Winner with everyone. I found I needed double the topping mixture, but I had big red potatoes, so I cut them in quarters (disks).

This recipe is the BOMB! I've made it several times now with rave reviews. The last time I made it with it with fingerling potatoes (3#) and the amount of seasoning was spot on.  This goes into my recipe file for sure.

Tasty potato recipe. I used five small red potatoes cut in half and roasted them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper so no sticking. Quick and easy enough for every day yet good enough to serve guests. Thanks, belle, I'll be making these often.

FANTASTIC!  I doubled the parm and spices and didn't measure the EVOO (just coated the bottom of the PAM sprayed glass pan and a drizzle over the potatoes).  Our oven is quite temperamental, so I set the temp for 500, hoping for at least 400, and they were perfect in about 38 minutes.  I cubed the (white) potatoes for a better roast in our oven.  I ended up eating way more potatoes than salmon or broccoli tonight!  These will be a staple in our world; THANKS for the recipe!

Tried this tonight. LOVED it!! I used russet potatoes because that's what I had, and I also chopped them up into 1/4" pieces. Soooo good. My three-year-old (who is pretty picky) had 3 servings!! She loved helping me "mix" them, too. We will definitely be making these again.

These potatoes were wonderful and so easy to make.
It was such a nice change from baked potatoes, I loved the flavor of the parmesan cheese, the addition of sour cream set it over the top.

Yum!! Totally kid approved. Since I feared the cheese might get over cooked before the potatoes were tender enough... I cut the small red potatoes into quarters and tossed them generously in all the topping and then put into a greased pan. They had a tendency to stick... so next time I will go in and give them a toss more frequently.  Everyone ate these as-is. No sour cream or ketchup was required by the boys. 2 thumbs up!

Tried it and loved it!  I'm a potato nut and these are really great.  Only change and it's just a personal preference, I peeled the potatoes and since they were kind of big, I cut into quarters. I just never cared for potato skins. But seriously, give these a try!!

This were SO GOOD! When I saw the recipe I just had to make it to go with our grilled chicken that evening. Two little minor tweaks, I didn't have red potatoes just russet so that is what I used.  It was also so darned hot here that I "baked" them in the gas grill while grilling our chicken.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, bellepepper just loved it!

These were very tasty! I found the cheese didn't stick that well to the potatoes but I was able to scrape any extra off the pan and place it back on. I sliced my potatoes into threes lengthways so there was a middle slice with two cut sides. I had quite small potatoes, if they were bigger I would have sliced them into more pieces. They were a nice change from plain roasted potatoes and fairly easy to prepare to have alongside something else like barbeque chicken as we had this time. Next time I might try parboiling them as someone else suggested. Thanks for a great recipe.

I cut smaller red potatoes in half, quartered the bigger ones. I put them on heavy duty foil that was very lightly oiled, and few stuck when I tried to turn them, so next time a little more oil in the pan. Seasoning was just right as is. By looking at them, I took them out 5-10 minutes early, and they were great, but probably would have been slightly crunchier and just as good at 40 minutes, too. These were awesome! Cooked and fluffy inside, crispy outside, and not a lot of fat in them. Will be making these again for certain. Next time I'll experiment with microwaving potatoes for ~3 minutes, and see if I can cut down oven time a bit.

Excellent Recipe! Only change I made was to add some onion powder and some Italian seasoning. Tried to get the smallish potatoes of the same size and cut them in half. Cooking time was Perfect, will make again for sure.

I only give three as this was the first time I made them and feel it can be improved (for myself, not to slight o.p.) I boiled a bit prior and only used one pound. They turned out pretty well. I put some sour cream with green onion on the side and added a bit of onion powder. I will definitely make again to see if they get better, or stay the same (good!) I normally don’t do well with potatoes and was quite pleased with the 3nd result from this recipe.

I made these to take to a pot luck kind of supper. I only had white and Idaho potatoes on hand so I used half of each and doubled the recipe. After looking at the pictures and reading the cooks notes and reviews, I sliced the potatoes (with skin) thinly on a mandolin instead of just halving them, dried the slices with paper towels before tossing them thoroughly with the oil and seasonings, and baked them on a large, parchment-lined baking sheet, turning them several times in the over 40 minutes it took for them to brown up and look done. They were cooked perfectly, with varying degrees of browned crispy edges and surfaces, but tender and perfectly seasoned throughout. I forgot to bring the sour cream, which would have made them even better.

I made the recipe with small yellow potatoes and was sure to rub them around in plenty of oil, cut side down. I waited to add the parm until I flipped them cut side up, so it didn't burn before they were done. They were yummy!

Made the recipe exactly as is and my family loved it!  I did take the suggestion of others and parboiled the potatoes for a few minutes before draining, patting dry and seasoning.  I sliced the potatoes about 1/4” thick and baked in a single layer.  Next time I will add a little more salt but really the recipe is spot on as is!

Great recipe. The submitter is right. I used at least 1 T of olive oil to half the recipe. Thick slices in a cast iron skillet so I think we could have used more of the seasoned coating and I also think it needs a bit more salt. We loved it though and ate every bite.

It was fine, but nothing to write home about like others thought. I added parmesan at the end to make it more parmesan-y.  Might make again, but think there are better roasted potato recipes out there to discover instead of this one.

Everyone enjoyed them. I cooked them in a cast iron skillet in the oven. I used anothers suggestion to sprinkle cheese mixture in the pan then put cut side epotato on top, worked like a charm. Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.

Made this dish for some friends with sausage and peppers, and it turned out great.  I would suggest (which I did) add more water and oil (I used olive oil) or cook the potatoes a  little more baking.  I added extra cheese and everyone loved it.

These are so good. My family wants me to make them all the time. I do cut the potatoes into fours or sixes depending on the size of the potatoes. Also, like someone else suggested, I press the wedges individually into the spice/cheese mixture to give them all an even coating. It takes time but worth it. Delicious!

The potatoes were hard as rocks and required a whole lot more of cooking and additional liquid in order to become edible.  Very disappointing since the rest of the meal was ready to be served.

Only change made, was that we doubled the dry ingredients for coating the potatoes. 
Will surely be making this again!

I will definitely make these again!  Crispy on the outside and creamy and smooth on the inside.  I did add a bit more parmesan cheese at the end.  Make extra and use them as breakfast potatoes in the morning!!

I thought these potatoes were very good; my hubby said they were just okay. I used multi-colored fingerling potatoes that I cut in half lengthwise. I dried then oiled the potatoes and the pan, then sprinkled the seasonings atop. I didn't turn the potatoes so the topping wouldn't fall off. I cooked them 15 mins at 400, then 15 mins at 350. The texture was perfect.

Very good! The sour cream is a nice touch! However' i'd only really throw on the cheese at the last maybe minute or so. It also needs some more spices maybe.

Cut the potatoes into small wedges. Double the spices. Add green and red peppers with the cut potatoes. My boyfriend made this with potato halves not small wedges and the potatoes did not fully cook well.

Even when I turned the potatoes over halfway through baking, they were still unevenly done. However, that did nothing to ruin the flavor, and I loved them. My husband was the only one to complain about it.

A delicious recipe for roasted potatoes. Easy, straight-forward, and very tasty. I used Yukon golds ... I would expect this recipe would be great for any type of potato.

I didn’t blot the potatoes, I sliced them like it shows in the picture not just in half.  Then I just threw them right on top of the Parmesan cheese mixture, drizzled them with olive oil, and tossed it all together.  I’m sure not as uniform but it worked fine for me and was quicker.  I also didn’t turn them over I just turned the broiler on for a few minutes.  A very good recipe that we will have again.

Pretty tasty! I made these potatoes but accidently added lemon juice to them (cooking too many things at once) The lemon juice was actually a good addition.

This is (pardon my French) one helluva a recipe. It is to die for. Oh. I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE COOK TOP!!! If you want to make an Over Roasted Potato, then this is MOST DEFINITELY ONE YOU WANT TO DO!!! I used the cast iron skillet. After all. I am from the south. This was so good that I took a picture of the skillet after the oven and of course a taste test and sent this to my children. However. I did NOT send a copy of the recipe with "MAKE SURE TO SEE THE REVERSE NOTE" as is stated. I told them all. They can get it when I am dead. Talk about gratitude. I'm grateful!!! And I do NOT critique recipes all over the internet. This one. Different story. OH!!! ENJOY!! Bon Appetite!!!

Very good combo of spices.  I cooked 'em a good bit longer than the recipe suggests.  I did about 1/2 hour per side AFTER I parboiled the little suckers for 4 mins.  We like crusty taters 'round here.

This is pretty good.  I didn't use sour cream and actually the tates were so crispy and tasty I didn't miss anything.  If I feel like I need it I'll use fat free greek yogurt.  I added smoked paprika to my potatoes and substituted olive oil for veggie oil.

This was super easy to make and very tasty. When making the cheese mixture, I thought it wouldn’t be enough, but it was the perfect amount for 4 large red potatoes. Great side dish!

My potatoes were too big, so the flavor was minimal.  This is my fault, the blend was very good!!

This is the best recipe for red potatoes that I've ever had. It's a great side dish and compliments fried chicken very well -
 this dish definitely has the "Southern boyfriend stamp of approval". I have made it in my cast iron skillet twice. Unfortunately they stick horrifically despite the oil. I may switch to a Pyrex pan to see if that saves me any labor.

Very good! I sliced the potatoes instead of cutting them in half, since they were all different shapes and sizes. I love garlic, so I used a full teaspoon. These turned out a bit too greasy for me, so next time instead of putting oil in the baking pan I'll try giving it a healthy dose of cooking spray.

Had to use russets as that's what I had on hand but I sliced this strips and followed the rest of the directions. They were absolutely fantastic!!  I also only had sprinkle cheese but it was five cheese and we ate it all!!

They key to this recipe is to make sure the parmesan is pressed into the cut side of the potato before you begin roasting.  The results are a a crunchy flavorful crust on the outside with a creamy potato inside.

Made this as a side for dinner - was a huge hit with the family.  
I sliced the potatoes liked scalloped potatoes (thinish slices)  and doubled the dry ingredients.  Stirred it  half way through - it was great.  We were looking forward to  leftovers for a breakfast side the next morning but at the end of dinner - they were all gone!

These tasted fine, but there was so much oil in the recipe that they never did crisp up, even after an additional 30 minutes in the oven.  Next time I would skip the layer of oil at the bottom of the pan and just lay them out on a foil-lined pan with a spray of canola oil.

Just made this and used the advise of another and par boiled the taters for a few and cut like the pic shows at the end I jacked the temp up to 425 to make sure they crisped up added some slices of red onion I had in the fridge cause to me taters and onions just got to go together and it was fantastic. Will do this again and again. Thanks

These potatoes are so tasty and we loved the way they baked so nicely with a light crisp. I cheated because I was in a hurry to get dinner done. I cubed (large cubes) the potatoes and microwaved them for 5 minutes. Then I tossed in olive oil and the seasonings and put in an iron skillet. Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Perfect!

It was OK, but not my favorite roast potato recipe.  I used finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano from a block I had, and may not have used enough,as I could not taste any cheese flavor on the potatoes.  I think they may have been better with a coarser grated or shredded Parmesan with more body.
I may try it again.

Beware! The serving size is for 6.   I mean-  2 lbs of potatoes should be plenty! Well it's not! My dinner party of 5 kept eating, and eating and eating these potatoes!  I used small mixed new potatoes and cut them in half.  Then followed the ingredients exactly, except I did add some extra Parmesan per other reviewers suggestions.  I also just baked them for about 40 minutes in a casserole dish, turning them once.  Turned out excellent! Will definitely be reusing this recipe.

This was terrific!  I dump the vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet, dip a potato in the oil making sure it is completely covered, then dip the cut side of the potato in the parmesan mixture and put the cut side down on the cast iron skillet.  Then I bake as directed.  Yummy every time!

Yummy potatoes. Collectively the family wanted more of the great flavors in each potato. Next time I will quarter the potatoes providing them with more surface area for the Super combo of flavors.

Very tasty.  Topped with additional parmasan cheese and parsley when they came out of the oven.  Served with some sour cream seasoned with seasoning salt, garlic powder, and parsley per another reviewer's suggestion.  Will make again.

Great recipe, our guests loved them! When I turned the potatoes I dipped the cut side in more shredded parmesan cheese. Will make these again :)

Kind of bland as is. Will make again, but add more garlic, maybe some red pepper. Just gotta do something to spice them up.

It was delicious! I didn't change any ingredients but because I wanted to make it and ribs at the same time, I baked it at 350° for 30 min each side. I also cut the potatoes into 1/2" slices. It came out perfectly. I'll make this again. Thanks!

I have made several times.  I cut the potatoes into quarters instead of halves, and roast them on a baking pan covered with parchment paper.  The family loves these!

This was an instant hit! Cut potatoes into thin rounds.  I made 1 batch with paprika and one without. My elderly Dad cannot tolerate paprika. Both were delicious!  I doubled the seasoning mix and put it in a gallon sized zip lock bag- shake & bake style! Also put oil in a zip lock bag and shook to coat before shaking in seasoning bag. Baked for 15 minutes on each side. Crispy on outside, soft in middle.

Very tasty, but I would recommend slicing the potatoes into smaller pieces.  I quartered them, but still feel like they weren't cooked thoroughly enough.  

Also had an issue with the parmesan and seasoning sticking to the potatoes...will update if I find a good way to make it work.

All in all, a very good recipe that just needs a bit of adjustment, mostly out of personal tastes.

I read the tips in the review and made this with my cast iron pan on the stove.  Use plenty of oil, and cut the potatoes into slices or smaller pieces.  Watch carefully, this burns fast. I added some hot pepper flakes and garlic flakes.  Great flavor!

It was good but it took a lot longer than it says to get them to brown. All other food items were ready and I didn't want to get cold so I took them out before they were crispy like I wanted. I will try agin and allow for more time.

I agree with one reviewer who suggested putting on baking paper which makes cleanup easier, prevents sticking,  and encourages even browning.  Next time I would try tossing potatoes in coating rather than sprinkling cheese coating on top of potatoes. Add some cayenne pepper and or fresh garlic too.  You could also add other veggies to this (like red bell pepper, onion, carrots, etc).

Just okay. Needs way more seasoning and Parmesan cheese. Maybe the red potatoes are too bitter. Might use yellow or white potatoes next time.

Excellent roast potatoes. We cooked them in a roasting tin on our bbq with the cover down. Crunchy outside and really tasty. My own roast potatoes were good but I'll be cooking them this way from now on.

These were nothing special. I used baking potatoes and quartered them. Other than that I didn't change a thing. The cheese came out in hard clumps that don't really stick to the potatoes I probably won't make this again.

Delish!  I was looking for a recipe for roasted potatoes that was a little different, and chose this one.  Glad I did.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I forgot the paprika, and added just a little bit of rosemary.  I think that, as long as you don't overdo the seasonings, you could personalize it as you wish and it would be just grand.  Thanks for posting.

My potatoes came out great!  The only thing I did different was to put the cheese and spices in a Ziploc bag and then shake the oiled potatoes in it, but next time I will put the cheese and spices on a plate and press the potatoes into it, so each piece will have even more flavor.

This was a big hit. I did put the potatoes in @ 450 for about 20 minutes as one reviewer suggested and lowered the temperature to 350. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The only thing I will do differently next time is dice the potatoes instead of cut them in half.

I used this recipe, adding broccoli and cauliflower, as well as three chicken breasts.  Roasted at 450 for 20 mins, then 350 for thirty.   It turned out delicious.  A big hit with all the family!!

This was just okay.  Thought it would be more flavorful.  This might be my fault though because, since it's only my husband and me, the recipe as is would have been too much.

I was disappointed.  I actually doubled up on the Parmesan cheese.  I found that the cheese got lost in the cooking.  I will try the recipe again.  Next time, I will wait until I turn the potatoes over, and sprinkle on the cheese.  It will add so much cheese favour.

I made it as a side dish with chicken and it was amazing! I also added some mozzarella on the potatoes, and they melted on top of them.

Note the cook's tip: for applying parmesan, and just dip each cut side in the cheese mixture.  (I needed more cheese mixture AND more olive oil.)  Spraying the dish with Pam does help release the potatoes - thanks for the tips, Bellepepper!

Made these tonight for supper. Absolutely delicious. I made one substitute. I'm not big on garlic so I subbed onion powder. I've  tried other recipes that claim the outcome is a crispy outside and creamy inside but that rarely happens. This one was true to its word.

I quartered my potatoes but everything else was exactly the same. These were delicious! I even bought a block of Parmesan so I could have the freshly grated cheese. We had grilled chicken and asparagus fresh from the garden to go with them.

Easy and quick, as promised. After cutting the potatoes, mixing almost all the ingredients, and realizing I had no paprika, I used Mrs. Dash Table Blend as an ad hoc substitution. It worked well - however, if you use a similar spice blend as a substitute, you may want to exclude the 1/4 tsp black pepper, since many blends already contain pepper.

I doubled the topping and diced the potatoes to make sure they got extra crispy.  I also sprinkled them with some kosher salt before roasting.  But my husband and I typically don't like red potatoes so I was looking for a way to use up what I had and these were quite tasty with those adjustments!

Wonderful! Crispy outside and creamy inside. I use red potatoes about an inch and 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter at most. Cut in half as directed. I eyeballed ingredients and cooking time but despite by lazy techniques, they were delicious!

I've never submitted a review before (even though I'm a devout AR user), but these potatoes deserved my attention! I've always had trouble getting roasted potatoes crisp on the outside without making them chewy or dry. These are supremely crispy and yet fluffy like a baked potato inside. No ketchup needed.., sour cream is the way to go with these. Try them, you'll love 'em!

I thought these were pretty good.  I had to cook it longer than 40 minutes and they were still a little soft.  I wonder if there is too much oil too because you spray the pan, put oil on the pan, then put oil on the potatoes and put them in the pan.  They were a bit soaked in oil.  I still enjoyed them a lot.  Put a little extra sprinkling of parm on top at the end.

This looked delicious.  Unfortunately, it didn't taste delicious.  The potatoes were NOT creamy inside, but quite dry, like a baked potato.  The outside didn't add very much flavor either.  Overall, bland.

Great recipe, I tripled the parmesan mixture and used a bag to coat potatoes  I also used nonstick foil with Pam spray and drizzled oil.They turned out great, but they really take about 30 minutes to cook for desired friendliness.

These were really good!  Crunchy on the outside, soft potato on the inside.  I did just automatically cook them for the longest suggested time because we tend to like our potatoes cooked more but I think they could have been cooked less.  Next time I will try 35 minutes total.   A definite do-again and again and again!

I made these, but omitted the cooking spray and extra olive oil in the pan, opting instead for nonstick tinfoil. These were good, although based on other reviews I had to keep an eye on it to make sure the cheese didn't burn, and some of my pieces (I cut smaller than halves based on the size of the potatoes and other reviews) might have been a little too large to cook all the way through.

I used little gold potatoes instead of the red skin potatoes and it turned out great.  I also added a little more parm to the coating (I love cheese) and used granulated garlic in place of the garlic powder.  We had these with some lolly pop lamb chops and the paring was perfect.

Excellent.  Don't change a thing. Just be sure not to slice the potatoes too thin or they can become too crispy.

I followed the recipe closely, substituting honey gold potatoes and a parmesan blend. The results were delicious and everyone loved them! I used more oil like other reviewers.

Totally loved it! I am such a potato girl, we had these with bbq, slaw, and baked beans, they stole the spotlight! I followed the directions exactly but when I added the seasonings I had no extra to fill in the bare spots, I made another batch and pressed the potatoes into it, they turned out wonderful, did have a little sticking to the pan but they were great with ranch dip!

As another viewer advised, used a little more olive oil, cooked at 450 degrees for 20 minutes then 350 for 20. Used 3 T. of Parmesan cheese. Fantastic!

There were no leftovers. That is my measure of a family thumbs up. I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces for more sides to coat and crisp. I also doubled all the coating ingredients to fully coat the pieces, and "flipped" or stirred about half way through. Awesome!

So easy, everyone loves these.  Kids can help measure seasonings and shake potato slices in bag.  They take some time to cook, but if planned ahead of other dishes they are worth it.

I normally avoid recipes made with parmesan cheese because I have never cared for the taste of it. However when I saw this recipe I decided to give it a try. This is probably the best potato recipe I have ever made! I have made it numerous times now and it always comes out tasting wonderfully. I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and I recommend it highly. Thanks for sharing.

First time trying this at the firehouse. It was a huge hit. I would say add more oil and the iron skillet worked out great. Glad I found this site. Served this with the Zesty Italian Chicken and some garlic rolls and a salad.

I am not a big potato fan, but these are fantastic. I use ruby red gems, and just cut them in half, or any other larger potato cut into wedges. They always turn out perfect! I follow the recipe exactly, and they have never burnt, or been underdone. Delicious!

Thought these were just ok.  It might have been the taste of the parmesan cheese that was too toasted for my liking.  They were crispy on the outside and soft inside just as described.

Excellent recipe!  The only changes I made were to only use 1 pound of potatoes (kept the rest of the recipe measurements the same), used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the 1 teaspoon oil in preparing the pan (found potatoes were coated sufficiently with the 1 tablespoon).  For ease, mixed the potatoes with the oil and cheese mixture in a Ziploc bag instead of using another bowl.  But, as I stated earlier, this recipe was "the bomb"!  Thanks so much for posting!

This roasted potato recipe was so easy and full of flavor. My husband and I loved it! I started them out at 425° as a couple of the other reviewers said they did and then turned the oven down to 350° for the last 20 minutes. They were crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside. They did stick to the pan just a little even though I used a little extra oil, but loosened  easily using a thin spatula. I served them with omelettes tonight for supper. Quick and easy , and so filling. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe  ''bellepepper'' .

Good grub! My red potatoes were big so I just cut them into chunks and I used EVOO. I did them on the Pampered Chef baking stone for 35 minutes and they came out perfect. Lots of compliments around the table which makes me happy. Thanks bellepepper. These are a keeper.

We absolutely loved these.  I used the small or baby Yukon gold potatoes instead of red, and doubled the amount of parmesan.  Dribble a little home made ranch dressing over these and yum yum perfection.

They're amazing! You just need to lower the pan in the oven then they'll be perfect! I made them tonight for 2 so cut the recipe back, I cut them in slices then brushed the potatoes w/a mixture of balsamic vinegar/evoo/oregano/basil/garlic...(I don't ever add salt to my prep, there's just so much everywhere, if one needs it add at the table rarely happens tho)...used foil (nothing sticks on foil, so less oil) in pan. After brushing, put them in the oven, roasting for about 15 min then turned basted, sprinkled w/parm 10 min added some thin sliced Mex green onions on top for last 5 min., they got perfect golden brown...BOOM! Just use your brain, OK? It's not that hard, if you can read you can cook...watch your food if it's getting too dark lower oven, cover, or turn oven off! Peoples' ovens do vary, don't blame the lovely person who goes through the time & trouble to post a recipe & photograph it! It's a great idea to experiment on potatoes as if they are under cooked they won't kill you! LOL, but a lot of protein will...cheers

These are the best potatoes we've had. I make them often. My mom can barely wait to get them on her plate. She sneaks to grab some before we serve! Definitely a must!!

I have made these several times. I do use fresh garlic and double the recipe. They are wonderful. I cook mine in a hot iron skillet. Perfecto!

I am not a big potato person, but I thought this turned out good. I did a couple of things different than the recipie said.  I sliced the potatoes fairly thinly.  I didn't have grated parmesan, so I used shredded parmesan.  I ended up using much more of everything than it called for - I had to make more seasoning twice. I guess because I sliced the potatoes? I used two cookie sheets and put the potatoes in a single layer on the sheets and flipped them once. I thought they were going to end up greasy from tossing them (well, I more like dipped them) in the oil (which I used way more of as well), but after I flipped them once and finished cooking them off they weren't greasy. Just crispy and pretty darn tasty.

These were quick and easy to make.  I used regular potatoes and cooked them for a bit in the microwave to speed up the cooking time.  As mentioned in the notes I pressed each potato into the mix to ensure a good coating.  I will definitely make again. i

Loved these potatoes! I only had russets, so I sliced them uniformly and followed directions. I admit that I did add more parmesan to the tops of the potatoes but only because my parmesan was frozen and didn't stick very well. These are actually crispy on the outside. I will definitely make these again, bellepepper!

These were ok, but not as good as I was hoping.  I had to use a lot more oil to get them coated and then they were still sticking to the pan.  Taste was just ok.  I have other oven potato recipes that were better.

I was short of time so, while the oven heated up, I microwaved the washed potatoes for 10 minutes.  Then I sliced 'em and laid them out single layer and topped with the cheese mixture. I roasted them only for 15 minutes total and the cheese was perfect.  The bottom was soft and creamy but the top was golden crispy and perfect.  A good combination.  Thanks for the new idea - wonderful!

I never leave reviews, but I just had to say these are the BEST roasted potatoes made as is, except that I quartered the red potatoes.  Be careful, they might stick if you don't spray/grease your pan enough, but they will taste great even if stuck a little!  Mine were not really crispy, but that didn't matter...we loved them.  Thanks for the perfect potato recipe!!

We liked this recipe a lot. The only change I made was to cut the potatoes into quarters rather than in half, and I'd do that again. Great texture and flavor. Very easy to make as well.

What's not to love about this recipe?  I followed the directions well except only had 1.5 lbs of potatoes.  I'm glad I will have leftovers so that we can enjoy them again tonight!  The tablespoon of oil that I used to douse the potatoes with was a rosemary infused olive oil.  Thanks for a very wonderful side dish!

FLAVORFUL & DELISH!!  My friend has a CSA in Crab Orchard, Tennessee and gave me some red potatoes in my birthday produce basket. I found this recipe and it will be a go-to favorite.  My potatoes were a little large so I sliced them in thick slices - HEY - more coverage for the wonderful seasoning!

We love potatoes. I made this tonight, they are soo good. Thanks bellepepper for the recipe. Some of my potatoes stuck on the pan, next time I will coat the pan with more oil. This is a keeper.
