Thank you for sharing this recipe!  This is a favorite recipe from my childhood and it's one of my Dad's favorite pies.  He is terminally ill right now and I'm honored to make this pie and share it at this special time.

This is a very tasty pie.  I found it a little on the sweet side.

Easy to make, but lacking in flavor.  If you want the taste of a butter tart in a pie, this is not the right recipe.  Was okay, but noone is asking for it again at our place.

Very easy to make pie, I boiled the raisins until they plumped and that was a little over the time in the recipe...
