this is the classic recipe.  It is missing something though.  You will need 2 orange slices & 2 cherries.  When you put the sugar cube/simple syrup & bitters in the glass, also add one orange slice and one cherry.  This all gets muddled (squished) together, topped with ice and then the whiskey.  Garnish as directed.  DELICIOUS!

This was my late father-in-law's drink of choice.  Definitely use "the good stuff" when making these and while you don't always need the orange slice just like the Manhattan the cherry is always necessary.

To make it more palatable (for those who don't like straight booze) a splash of club soda or 7 up is great!

I'm a native Louisvillian and using any thing but Ky. bourbon is a travesty! Makers Mark is my choice. I like bitters and use about 6 good shakes. To sweeten it up use a small squirt of agave syrup. Swish it around the bottom of the glass, Add ice, 2 oz. Makers Mark. Garnish with maraschino cherry plus a little juice from the bottle and slice of orange. (May sqeeze a wedge of orange.)  Be prepared for a second one!

Excellent and classic!  It really makes so much difference when it's made from scratch.  My only substitution: I used rye whiskey instead of bourbon.  I've always preferred my Old Fashioned with rye, not sure why . . . maybe it's the slightly drier taste.  Try it sometime!

This is my favorite drink in the winter except I substitute marachino cherry juice for the simple syrup and brandy for the whiskey.  I also squeeze an orange wedge and add sour such as 50/50 or Squirt.  Delicious.

I thought this was going to grow hair on my chest! This was so super strong!!! I bought some Jameson whiskey for a dinner recipe and had some leftover and decided to try a classic cocktail. This tasted like straight whiskey on ice. I tried to modify it by doubling and then tripeling the simple syrup, doubling the oranges and squeazing them, and then adding in a couple of splashes of the cherry juice from the jar as others suggested. It made it more palateable then, but it still tasted too strong to drink. I wish I wouldn't have spent the extra money now on the bottle of bitters now. It couldn't be tasted anyway. I don't know what to think? Maybe, I just don't like whiskey? Hmmm

My father had one of these when he came home from work.  When we do the same it is in his honor.  I keep a jar of orange slices marinating in the simple syrup in the refrigerator for this drink.  We use Ancient Age bourbon which is what he used.  According to the reviewer in The New York Times Ancient Age is just as good as the top shelf brands.  The aroma is so evocative of my dad's favorite drink and so 5:30ish.

A classic cocktail. Good with any of the above mentioned spirits but also enjoyed with brandy as a twist.  I prefer the rye old-fashioned.

In Wisconsin, brandy or Whiskey old fashioneds are made at every bar.  I prefer the brandy.  Often the cherry/ies are muddled in the bottom of the glass.  To simplify we use 7up/Sprite rather than water and simple syrup.  Some people prefer using sour mix instead.  Stores around here also sell Old Fashioned mix.  Bottoms up.

This sounds like a pretty standard old fashioned, and the way I used to make it. Now I use all fresh fruit, and it is the best ever. I combine several dashes of bitters, a fresh cherry (cut in half, remove bit, then squeeze some juice into glass and add remaining cherry). A slice of orange (a small amount if the juice is squeezed in, then twist the rind to get the oils and essence).  Several ounces of bourbon (or rye, etc, but I love Makers) sugar/simple syrup (I prefer sugar in the raw or a cube, it will bring good flavor) add a splash of water and stir. You get good bourbon flavor, with just a touch of the sweet and the juice to cut it. If you are making something like an old fashioned you need to taste the bourbon, if you don't want to taste it go get a vodka red bull, or a wine cooler.

If you are not a whiskey lover this is not the drink for you the bitters and syrup (and cherry and or orange) are not used to cover up the flavor but rather to add to it. If you believe that a Jack and Coke is a cocktail then you probably should stay away from drinks like this.

I prefer making this cocktail without the cherry and orange.

I used my favs to make this, Bulleit rye whiskey, made my own simple syrup with brown sugar, Angostora bitters, Luxor cherries, twist the skin of a clementine to release the oils and shook it all in a clean jar then poured over an ice sphere. It's very smooth sip by sip. Put your orange slice in there with that cherry and go sit by the fire.

Hi! 
Y'all made me thirsty!
Used what I had on hand.
Brandy, brown sugar, "Cherries in Brandy" bought at mall during Holidays
{and some of the juice}, squeeze lime and lemon juices, Brandy, and ice.
Nummy!
Had another sip after sitting a bit, even tastier.  I think the Bing cherries make this particular one, plus brown sugar.

Not a bad recipe at all. Ensure you are using the "good stuff" as others have mentioned. Makes a world of difference. I typically use a sugar cube and some water with bitters. Also make sure you get large ice cubes for this drink. They dont melt as fast and water it down. I would never use a full orange slice. This isnt a screwdriver. Instead a hint of orange goes a long way with a simple twist of the orange peel over the glass then put the twist in the drink. Also luxardo cherries are a MUCH better choice for this drink. A little pricey but well worth it. As an added bonus if you want this drink smoked, use wood chips on a safe surface, light them on fire with a blowtorch, then place your glass over the wood chips to catch the smoke. While the glass fills with smoke, make your old fashioned and transfer it in to the smoked glass.

My favorite! I always use a sugar cube and pour a little bitters and juice from the maraschino cherries jar over it before crushing it along the bottom of the glass.

Good beginning.  I prefer to add the bitters, raw sugar and club soda to the bottom.  I add bourbon and the thick orange slice, then fill the glass with ice cubes.  Dangerously good.

Solid recipe. A couple things from the comments: use Bourbon! Not Jameson! Also, this isn’t a “sweet” cocktail. It’s meant to taste like bourbon. Try making your own simple syrup and infuse some dried fruits. I use blueberry. Finally, step up your game with some amarena cherries for garnish.

This IS the classic version,  just be sure to use the highest end liquor you can afford.  (I use Makers Mark). Having said that, it makes a very strong  drink, so rather than water it down with Sprite or Seven Up, try dipping the rim of the glass in orange juice, then in sugar - then proceeding with the recipe.  Some will call it heresy - I call it delicious!

Delicious, except I muddled the fruit first in simple syrup, add ice, then whiskey!  Garnish with another orange slice!

While there are many ways to create this simple drink what to me is essential is to use a good rye rather than a bourbon.

Used Demerara sugar cubes instead of the simple syrup and 4 Roses yellow label bourbon. Very tasty and not too sweet.

Followed recipe. First time used a very old jar of bitters. I bought a new bottle and much better.  Used bourbon.

loved this recipe!! The only issue is finding the ingredients in a convenient place and correct proportions
Would anyone be interested in having a cocktail kit sold in stores with the necessary ingredients?

I like to muddle the orange, cherry, sugar with the bitters first, and then add the liquor.  Stir and add the ice cubes and a splash of club soda to top it off!

I added some grenadine to make it a little sweeter. And sometimes some seltzer.

Made with Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey, fantastic! Stronger whiskeys will obviously make it stronger - so for comparison i tried adding a splash of ginger ale - wonderful addition. For color I drizzled in a little cherry juice.

This was my dad's favorite drink when he dined out or when company came. I always wondered as a child what the Angostura bitters were for and now I know.

I love muddle old fashions.When my kids were little and going wild my husband would come home and make the best muddle old fashion using CC.I go down south and very few bartenders don't know what I'm talking about so I give them the recipe.Mash the fruit real good,add a dash of bitters,a 1/2 tsp of sugar,the CC and the ice cubes.Wow it's great.
