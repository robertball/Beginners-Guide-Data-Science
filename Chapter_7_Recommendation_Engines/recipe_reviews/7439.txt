Absolutely delicious! This cake is silky smooth as can be, fairly dense and moist yet not 'heavy' or too rich. I think that's due in part to the cake flour and in part to the sifting. As the men who tried it said, it's not 'gaggingly sweet' like they feel most chocolate cakes are. I also used the chocolate torte frosting as recommended, and sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the frosting in the middle layer. I will DEFINITELY be making this cake again.

This is the first time making this cake and I made this cake today for my husband's birthday and it turned out beautifully. Very good and rich! And I don't even cook or bake often. For those of you who don't know how to do the double boiler fill a large pan up with water to boil and put the mixing bowl containing the eggs and sugar on top of it then stir until it thickens. For the chocolate torte frosting I only used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. And it still turned out very good! Yummy! You will also be satisfied with only 1 slice of cake. And it taste delicious with a glass of milk too.

I used normal milk instead of condensed milk (was by accident) and baked it for an hour did turn out quite fudge like. I also used raw sugar and that seemed to work ok. I put tiny chocolate bits in the recipe and didn't use any colouring so it looked like a vanilla cake with chocolate spots in it! All in all a good recipe although not your traditional spongy chocolate cake.

Dry and heavy. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I make all my cakes from scratch and never had one turn out like this.

This cake was very heavy and not what I was looking for. My husband thought it was brownies. It is also very rich. A small slice goes a long way. It did taste good however.

Extremely disappointed in this. Followed recipe to the letter. I wanted another chocolate cake recipe to add to my "fab" collection. This is not it. Too crumbly the batter overfilled my two pans. Will NOT make this again. EVER.

I have made this recipe many times and it is one of the best recipes for chocolate cake ever! The only thing I would change is to add cocoa powder to make it even more chocolatey. But otherwise it is easy to make and comes out perfect every time.

The flavor was good but the cake turned out very dry and crumbly. It was difficult to frost and it made a mess when it was served. I'm still looking for a chocolate cake recipe.

this cake is lovely! i made it last week for my friends birthday and it got rave reviews. i added chopped peacans to the sandwich layer as recommended by another reviewer and it was yummy. the texture is so good! it hasnt got a really chocolatey taste so im thinking of trying it with some added chocolate chips next time i try it. ive also just made a variation of this but unstead of the chocolate and vanilla i added sultanas apple and cinammon. i didnt sandwhich the cakes together just dusted each with icing sugar and have 2 cakes instead if one. theyve turned out really well. my boyfriend and his flatmates have pretty much devoured both of them already. this really is a fantastic cake recipe the texture is just gorgeous!

Wonderful cake! It's very easy to make and is very moist but really retains a "from scratch" taste. The only thing I'll do next time is maybe add a bit more chocolate as my cream cheese icing overpowered the chocolate and put it in the background a bit. I will be making this cake again:D

Tough to rate because it is 5 stars for moistness but 1 star for "chocolate". I used 2 oz. chocolate but when I make it again I will probably use Dutch Process cocoa powder and 6 oz. melted chocolate.

This cake is really good it's easy and fun to make and it turns out awesome! I made it in a bundt pan and baked it for about 40 minutes then i used a simple glaze out of the Canadian Living Recipe which is just 1/3 cups whipped cream heated until just boiling over the stove then you pour that over 1 tbsp of butter and 3 oz (just under 1/3 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips... and just whisk it together until it's all melted... it tastes delicious! The ONLY thing is that the cake could be a little bit more moist but that could be because I used regular flour instead of cake flour!

Delicious made this by tripling the recipe and took a chance. I made four layer chocolate cake and cupcakes. I added a German chocolate frosting on them and they were a hit. People were eating the cupcakes as soon as I got them out of a oven. THANKS FOR SHARING

I am not a fan of chocolate cake however my friend LOVES chocolate cake and it was his birthday. He abslolutely adored this cake which made everything worth while. I even tried a piece and considering my disdain for chocolate cake it was relatively delicious. I'm going to make it again for my five year old's birthday on Sunday
