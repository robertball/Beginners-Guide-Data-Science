Oaky but I like my recipe better but till quite good. I had to make 3 batches of caramel to coat all the popcorn, (that's why only 3 stars) I also turned the oven up to 300F  this seemed to keep the caramel softer so it coated the popcorn better when stired. My recipe has more corn syrup and is just brought to the boil and no baking soda. My daughter works in a popcprn making store and says they too use baking soda but I don't care for how it make the caramel thicken up so fast, I found thios harder to work with. I will make again I likedthe crunch and the family gobbled it all down right to the last kernel. I daught liked it too!

This is my first time making caramel corn so I was a little scared...but after reading all the comments I ended up using 1 cup of unpopped corn and then I added 5 more servings of the sauce which comes out to:
1-1/3 cp brown sugar
2/3 cp butter
1/3 cp corn syrup
3/4 tsp salt
2 t/s baking soda
The recipe turned out awesome! I'll definately make this again soon!

This is a quick and easy way to make GREAT Carmel Corn.  If you use one bag of Microwave Popcorn this is just the right about of carmel, with a little left over to like the bowl. I like the way the baking soda makes it nice a fluffy, YUM YUM

I lost my recipe that I have been making for years and this one is it - with the exception that I believe (as Izzy said) this is too much baking soda.  I believe it should be 1/2 TEAspoon, not tablespoon.

right on the money followed it all the way with the exception on the oven temp 200 degrees was not hot enough so i put it on 300 and it was fine.  just keep an eye on it and mix it very well and it will coat all the popcorn. nice job rosemary will be using this at christmas time thank you!

It is so good I wish I had never made it!  Now all the kids expect it for all occasions!  My daughter had me bring it to her house, 4 states away, for Thanksgiving so her Marine husband and his friends have something to munch for ball games.

Excellent!, I did triple the caramel sauce for the amount of popcorn.Had complete coverage of the popcorn. I did not have the problems most of the reviews suggested. Superb taste. Great crunch. Exactly the reciepe I was looking for. Will add to my favorites.

I agreed with many reviews about not enough caramel.  I added pecans and doubled the sauce, which was perfect.  I also baked it in my roasting pan so that I could turn the popcorn without it spilling all over the oven.  Lastly, I did bake at 300.  Yummy, great to put in a tin and give as a little gift.

I had also 'lost' my recipe that I had been making since my kids (now ages 39,37 and 35 yrs!!) were home.  Now, one was asking for it!  As usual, AllRecipies had it!  Thank goodness...the only change I would make would be to use an air popper for the corn.  I also put mine in a large roaster pan instead of several cookie sheets.  Works just fine...mmmm good stuff.  You can also add some peanuts for a great immitation of that old, popcorn, peanut snack we all grew up on!!

This is almost perfect .. I used light brown sugar and the only adjustment I made was adding 1/2 tsp vanilla (not imitation) to the caramel before the baking soda. I also only used 11 cups of popped corn and baked it at 225 for an hour and 15 minutes. Totally amazing and totally delicious. My niece and nephew went through a big bowl in nothing flat and he (learning to talk) got really good at saying "More please"

Not nearly enough "caramel" to coat the amount of popcorn, even when I only popped 1 cup of popcorn.

Dangit, this is a real "diet-buster".  So good fresh out of the oven.  EASY to make.  The baking soda is the key to keeping the candy light and crunchy and easy to chew!  YUM!

Delicious! I have never made caramel corn before and I have to say I was a bit intimidated by it. However after using this recipe I will be making it again and again. I had to double the caramel recipe to evenly coat the popcorn and I only used about 1/2 Tblspn of baking soda all together (per other reviewers). I also found that the oven needed to be set at 300 degrees to keep the caramel soft enough to stir plus I only needed it to be in the oven for about 30min for it to be evenly coated with out burning. All in all a wonderfull recipie that my family loves! Thanks!

I frequently take a batch to get togethers and it's always a hit. I make two regular bags of Orville Redenbacher microwave popcorn and put the caramel over it. I bake it all in my Dutch roasting pan (big oval with high sides). Clean up is easy if you put the pan in hot water. It's sweet, salty, crunchy, the perfect snack food.

I was looking for a different recipe, but made these for a fundraiser.  They taste exactly like the Crunch-stuff in the stores.  I omitted the nuts but no one noticed.  I rated as a 4 because I too had to make a second batch of syrup and would have liked it to cover better.  Packaged in clear bags and Christmas ribbons, they were a big hit.

I followed this recipe exactly, and found that it has really good flavor, and really was easy. I will definitely be making it again. 
The one thing I did discover was that 1 1/2 cups of kernels made WAY to much popcorn for me. There wasn't enough caramel for it all, plus the amount of popcorn I ended up with was difficult to deal with. It was to much to mix, so I ended up with lots of large caramel clumps, and it took 3 cookie sheets in the oven. Next time I make it I will only use1/2 the kernels. Then it should just be perfect.

The recipe was good but one cup of unpopped corn makes a lot of popcorn I had to use three pans to hold it and the sauce only covered two pans. I burnt the first batch because is says to cook for five minutes without stirring. Second batch I stirred!

Excellent taste. Easy. Only made 1 cup of unpopped popcorn and agree that there could be more coverage of the caramel on the popcorn.

I've made this a few times using white and yellow kernels. Yellow kernels are more sturdy.  I did follow reviews and used less kernels which works best to get it all covered well. Will definitely make again
