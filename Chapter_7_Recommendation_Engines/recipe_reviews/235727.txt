Not a big hit with Hubs who thought there was too much going on, especially too much bacon.    I, however,  enjoyed this, tho' I omitted the salt and the paprika (didn't want to turn the egg salad a funky color) and I would agree that were I to make this again I'd cut back some on the bacon.

Awesome recipe, great bold flavors. Be careful of watering down those flavors with the celery though.  When making the recipe, I found we we had no celery. I loved that bold flavor (without the celery), however the wife wanted to try the original recipe.  After running to the grocery store and adding the celery, we both agreed the crunch was nice, but the celery muted/watered down the flavor of the egg salad.  Next time I will eliminate the celery or cut the celery amount in half.  Will definately use recipe now as my prefered egg salad recipe.

Really good! Husband wanted egg salad for dinner but I was wanting something a bit more filling and this really hit the spot. I used turkey bacon because thats what I had.

Made this for lunches this week.  I did leave out the pickle relish as we are not fans, but kept everything else the same.  I liked that it doesn't get watery after a couple of days, but it does have a odd orange hue due to the paprika.  We enjoyed it over lettuce, on two-tone rye toast, and stuffed in a tomato.  This worked well for our lunches and I will make it again, even adding the paprika.  Thanks SunnyDaysNora, for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! Did not add in the extra Salt as I used minced salami instead of bacon and it was salty enough. I also did not add in the Worcestershire sauce or the dill as I thought it would be too spicy. Just a bit too spicy for me but delicious.

I love this recipe. We have backyard chickens that lay more eggs than we can eat.  I found this recipe when looking for other ways to use them.  I use bacon bits because it's easier and sometimes chopped pickles. There are differing opinions in our house on how much Sriracha to use.

Great recipe for Egg Salad! It is simple to make and I substituted Hormel Bacon Bits for the bacon.
I will definitely have this as my Go To recipe moving forward.

I made it without the bacon and creamed the warm egg yolks with the mayonnaise first.  I also removed some of the excess liquid from the celery and onions by wrapping and squeezing them in a paper towel.  It turned out very creamy not watery with a perfect amount of crunch.  It was excellent and without the bacon, I didn't feel like "too much stuff was going on" as other reviewers said.

This is the tastiest egg salad I have ever eaten!  The only thing I omitted was the dried dill weed, but I used tangy dill relish, so the effect was probably similar.  I used just three eggs and adjusted the amounts of the other ingredients accordingly (I changed the serving size from "10" to "2" and estimated from there).  I ended up with enough filling for approximately four small sandwiches.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

I also didn't care for the celery but wanted a crunch factor. Substituted finely grated carrot and cut the bacon in half. Delicious!

The only thing I changed was the garlic Chile sauce, I didn’t have any on hand so I used cayenne pepper instead. It turned out great. My husband took it to work in his lunch for 2 days and loved it!

We liked this a lot; my husband especially did. I left the celery out just because I don't really like it in egg salad. I just sprinkled in the salt and pepper instead of measuring out the full amounts. This is a great alternative to chicken and tuna salads. The bacon really sold my husband on it. Thanks for a great recipe I'll use again.

What a wonderful twist on the usual egg salad. I went heavy handed on the Sriracha. It came out a beautiful orange/pink color. This would make an excellent topping for baked potatoes. Thank you for the recipe.

My husband is hooked on this egg salad.  He works construction and loves taking a cold sandwich for lunch but cold cuts get old.  This salad has it all it's loaded with flavor!  I love it over salad.

Excellent! Delicious. 
I used only 3 ou of bacon and that was enough. But if you want more bacon, go for it! It can't hurt. 
This is going into my regular rotation. Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic and a hit. I made it for our 4th of July picnic. My son was at first, a bit upset that I didn't make "classic" egg salad because his girlfriend had never had egg salad before of any kind. It was a hit. His girlfriend and her sister had seconds. They were even taking it and dipping their carrots and chips in it. My son also had seconds. I would never have thought to put paprika, Sriracha, and Worcestershire sauce in but it was fantastic. Didn't have dill and we don't eat bacon so left those out but still cannot say enough about how good this is. It's even better the next day. I will be making this again.

Yum yum yum, yum yum yum! I did not use bacon, and used dill relish instead of sweet because that's what I had. I bought peeled hard boiled eggs (cage free at Trader Joes's). So easy and delicious! Thanks.

Used turkey bacon and Lite Miracle Whip and added some garlic powder....pretty darn good.  Next time we will try to add some sweet basil paste to it
