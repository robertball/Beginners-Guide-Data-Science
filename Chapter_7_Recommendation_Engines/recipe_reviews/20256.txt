I was wanting something a little healthy but not a bread since my husband doens't like banana bread, I tried this dessert and it was delicious!  I did use 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon of applesauce instead of butter and 3 egg whites instead of 1 egg.  I also used 3 really ripe (almost black) bananas and lowered my sugar to 1/2 cup of each.  I used a bar pan and the bars came out moist and more like a bar with a little cakey spring to it.  My husband loved it and my son devoured his.  Great recipe!

This is a terrific recipe.  I didn't have the 10x15 jelly roll pan, so I made it in a 9x13 pan.  I had to leave it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes longer, but the result was a moist, banana-y, cake-like dessert!  I didn't even need to serve it with the recommended chocolate sauce and whip cream!  Definitely a keeper.

This is now what I make every time I bring a dessert into my daughter's class, she requests it as well as all her friends.  It's kind of nice to bring to school something other than cupcakes and cookies.  Works well if you use whole wheat flour, also!

This recipe is a real winner.  I think I will always consider making it when I have ripe bananas.  It's a cross between a chocolate chip cookie and banana bread.  I didn't have a jelly roll pan and wanted a thinner bar-type dessert so I spread the batter in a cookie sheet.  I baked it for approx. 7 minutes less than the recipe calls for.  Also I stored the bars in between layers of parchment paper in an air-tight container to keep them from sticking together.

I wasn't paying attention and mixed all the ingredients together at once. And I don't own a jelly roll pan so I used a 12x7 baking dish. They still came out great!  You can't go wrong with this recipe. It was gone in a day.  A great recipe for old bananas.

I cooked mine in a 9 by 13 pan for about 30 minutes. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet & garnished w/ a dollop of whipped cream & a sprinkle of mini-chips.

This is a very tasty bar recipe. Easy to make and really good refridgerated.  I put chocolate chips on 1/2 of the  top while it was still warm and then spread them over the top when they melted as a quick icing.  They turned out amazing with and without the chocolate.
Really good recipe for using up bananas.  Went like crazy at my party!

At first I thought these would not turn out. The sides were getting done too fast so I tuened the heat down. I had to bake mine for probably twice the time on the recipe - but my friends all LOVED them - I left out for them and I even got a message on my phone telling me how great they were! I used a chopped up milk chocolate bar instead of semi-sweet chips and it sunk a little to the bottom and made the best chocolate layer!

I always think it's funny when people say how much they like a recipe, then tell all about how they completely changed it into a new recipe...but now I'm guilty :)  I found out I had only half the usable amount of bananas I thought I did (more ripe than even I thought), so I used half mashed banana and half applesauce - and I did 1 cup white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour..and added a T of veg oil to give it more of a cookie texture (some reviews made it sound more like a banana bread.)  But it still came out quite banana-ey, and yummy!  Even my dh, who says he hates bananas, likes them :)  Thanks for the recipe!!

Mine turned out incredible! I unfortunately had to use not so ripe bananas, so I added a two extra tablespoons of white sugar and of brown sugar. I used Madagascar Vanilla, which livened it up. And for presentation purposes drizzled melted chocolate over the top! RAVE reviews!!

Ok, I admit...I rarely make a recipe without tweaking it along the way! My changes on this recipe were mostly to decrease the sugar and fat (although the topping I added made up for it!). Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup each, I substituted Equal's Sugar Lite for the white sugar. Use 1/2 cup butter & 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and increase the banana to about 1 1/2 cups. Here is the ingredient that sent these bars over the top - I sprinkled the bars with 1/3 cup chopped Butter Toffee Walnuts before baking. Refrigerate before cutting. We keep them in the fridge b/c we like them cold. We couldn't stop eating them. The whole 9x13 pan was gone within 24 hours. :O

Just like what the other review said, this tasted like banana bread with chocolate chips.  I thought the chocolate ruined it.  Maybe white chocolate chips or walnuts would be better. Terrible combination.

I made this twice, the first as written (I thought it was good, it tasted like banana bread with chocolate in it,) I wanted more of a pound cake, so the second time around I added 1/2 C sour cream and put in the whole bag (12 oz) of choc chips, I also upped the sugars to 3/4 C, and it was perfect, but either way it's pretty darn good!

This was awesome!!! Everybody loved it- kids and adults alike. No need for whip cream or chocolate syrup either - perfect the way it was. I did use 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and the rest white. I also used milk chocolate chips. And I did it all in the same bowl! Loved how quick it was to make AND bake!! I used my stoneware bar pan from Pampered chef and accidentally cooked it about 5 min too long, too, and it was still delicious!!

These are wonderful!  A nice way to use bananas that are about to be too ripe for eating.  I always spread a layer of powdered sugar icing on top after cooled.... can't get enough!

This was really good! I used whole wheat flour, per other reviewers, cut the white and brown sugar to a half cup each, and it was perfect. I served it with whipped cream, and chocolate sauce, and! vanilla ice cream, but I think it really tastes best plain. I would be sure not to overbake this...cook only until set. And, KEY--- Mix LIGHTLY, as little as possible, only until moistened. Definitely a keeper.

I was skeptical but made this for my Fiance since he LOVES bananas and I was surprised at how well it turned out. It's delicious! I added slightly more banana than the recipe called for but not by much. I also topped with powdered sugar and I think that made all the difference. I will definitely be keeping this recipe and try topping it with ice cream next time!

Excellent recipe for old bananas - a nice break from the banana bread.  I used a 9 x 13 airbake pan, and just left it in an extra 5 mins.  It was prefect. Thanks!

I had high hopes for this as an alternative to my constant Banana Bread. I pulled it out of the oven and had workers at my house. They each ate a big piece. My family came home - tasted it and said; "Don't make this again". Tried serving it to neighbors who stopped by. They ate part of the serving and left it. I asked them if they wanted to take any home - they said; "That is okay - thanks anyway!" Won't be making this again. Sorry.

The concept for this is excellent. One person said they thought that the chocolate may have ruined the dish for them, which I find strange as the two made a great combination. However, I did decide to use milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet (tasted great).

Someone else said to use a tablespoon of vegetable oil - I tried it and it came out fine (some people had been saying the texture was a little like banana bread, mine wasn't).

Finally, the directed baking time was far less than what mine needed (this may have been because I put in about 1/4 c more banana - I like banana). When I pulled it out at about 20 minutes and the center was still jiggling, I bumped the temp down to 325 and it took roughly another 20 minutes or so before the center started to firm-up and brown. The results were delicious and my friends were all very pleased.

I just made this for the first time with a few changes.  I used a 9x13 glass pan instead, added 1/4 c. of flour because I had extra bananas and thought it would be too runny if I didn't use extra flour.  I love chocolate so I added 1/2 c. extra chocolate chips.  The added bananas, which came out to about 1 3/4 c. were very ripe (about 80% black).  It definitely tasted like bananas and chocolate.  Not at all too sweet for me, but then again, I'm a dessert-aholic. My fiance loved it!

I used a cookie sheet with rims on it and bakes it for less time. It is a great recipe for those darn bananas that I never seem to eat fast enough.

Easy & delicious. I used a 9x13 cake pan, cooked about 35 minutes and used slightly less then 1 cup of chips since too much chocolate can overpower the banana flavor as I've noticed with other banana cake recipes.  Just those slight changes and it came out perfect. Didn't need to add anything else. Will definitly make again & again!

This is a wonderful must try recipe!!  I usually make banana bread, but was looking for something different to make with my ripe bananas! It is a nice change, and so easy!! Since I had them on hand, I also added l/2 cup of butterscotch chips and l/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  Melt or soften the butter for easier mixing of ingredients. If you don't mind the extra calories, try topping the batter with the crumb mixture from the  "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe from this site. I thought it made the bars a little more special, great for Sunday Brunch!! I used a 9xl3 pan, and baked 25-30 minutes. This is a great addition to my recipe collection!!

These had great flavor, but were very hard to cut.  I even put them in the fridge for awhile too.  Didn't help.  Was more like cake than bars.  I followed another reviewer and melted chocolate chips on top, which did not help in cutting them up.  If I make them again I may partially freeze them before I try too cut them up and then spread them with melted chocolate.

These are absolutely incredible.  I had an over abundance of bananas, so I came to allrecipes to find something to do with them.  I picked a winner, for sure!  My husband, who is not very fond of bananas, LOVED these.  I sent some to my in-laws house, and my m-i-l called to tell me how good they were.  This is an extremely easy, very yummy recipe.  My 2 kids loved them as well.  As others suggested, I would keep these in the refrigerator!

I had some bananas that were super ripe, and this recipe had popped up in my feed, so thought I would give it a try.
I didn't have regular choc chips, so I used butterscotch and then sprinkled the top with the little bit of mini choc chips that I had on hand. 
okay, so I started this review while the bars were in the oven. This is delicious, I could eat the whole tray right now, but I will try to show restraint :D 
It's more cake-like than I thought it would be, but very, very yummy! Try the butterscotch chips, you won't be disappointed!

I had some overripe bananas & didn't want to do a bread.  I'm SO glad I tried this recipe.  I used 4 bananas & cut down on the white sugar a bit, used a mix of light & dark brown sugar,  a mix of dark & semi-sweet chips, and made it in a 9x13 for 35 minutes.  No topping needed; it's perfect as is.  Gave some to the snow plow guy & he enjoyed them so much, he said the next time is free - can't go wrong with that!

I like these bars because they are cake-like and don't have an overpowering banana taste.  I put the batter in a 9 X 13 pan, bake for about 35-40 min. and often freeze the baked bars to use later.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Easy and tasty.  If you have trouble cutting the bar, put them in the freezer for a few minutes before cutting.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked this recipe, especially while the chocolate chips were still melted.  I didn't bother at all with the syrup drizzle.   I end up making banana bread every few weeks because as a family we don't really like bananas but I buy them because the are cheap and are good for you.  So when we have a few left that are getting too brown, I make bread.  But I wanted something a little different.  I was very pleased with how this turned out.  Moist and had a good crumb.  It baked just fine in a 9x13 pan.

Very good and moist!  Missing a little something though, maybe cinnamon?  
Anyway, to give it a little something extra I had about 1 cup of leftover maple pecan glaze (this was from the comments section from the Pumpkin Cheesecake II recipe I reviewed a little over a week ago.  It contained whipping cream, chopped pecans, granulated sugar and maple syrup, simmered over the stove for 20 minutes) to which I added 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar to make a frosting for this banana bar/cake dessert.  Made a great combination!  YUM!!

Not sure what the fuss is on this one.  Took way longer than stated just so the dessert wasn't mush and even then it just tasted like mashed bananas.  Not a hit.

I had some bananas that were going to go to waste if not put to use soon. I was tired of making banana bread all the time, so I pulled this recipe up and tried it. I'm not really a big fan of banana products myself. I usually give the breads away that I make to family members, but this recipe was very good. I tried some and it wasn't overly banana flavored as I had first thought it might be. The chocolate chips balanced it out nicely too. I'll definitely make this again. :)

I added about 1 cup of chopped walnuts for a little "crunch" feature.  YUM!  They tasted like banana flavored toll house cookie bars.

I took the advice of the other reviews and used 1c sugar and less than a cup of chocolate chips since my bananas were really ripe.  It's currently in the oven and smells heavenly!  My son and I tasted the batter and I'm really excited to try the final product!

I like to try different recipes to add to my list but this was a miss and although it says all purpose flour use cake flour and use 2 1/2 cups. Also use with this recipe extra fine sugar. Now you will enjoy it!

really good!  a *little* too sweet for me though, i decreased the amount of sugar to about 2/3 the amount, and didn't add the full amount of chips either.  I also added about 1/3-1/2 cup of extra banana bc i like a stronger banana flavor and the extra helps the moistness.  make sure not to add salt if your butter isn't saltless.  I baked it for an additional 5 minutes, and the consistency was perfect: a little crusty on the outside, and moist  on the inside :)

I absolutley loved this recipe. While I was cooking I didn't think it would turn out right because I didn't have any brown sugar and I didn't use any, and I used Baking SODA instead of Baking POWDER! Also, I used a 9x13 pan instead of jelly roll. It turned out great though. If you use the 13x9 pan then definitley put it on about 6 or 7 extra minutes. It looks as if it is burning but really it tastes great. It crinkles a little on the top and turns a little crispy. WONDERFUL! Definitley a keeper!

Absolutely amazing and easy, everyone I have shared this with has fallen in love with it. I made this in a 9x13 pan and cooked at 300 for 40 minutes.  The first few times I had them plain and they were amazing like that but I also tried them with cream cheese frosting on the top and they are even better that way!

Sooo Yummy!!! I didn't use brown sugar and just doubled the white sugar.  I also used 3 lg. ripe bananas and 2 cups of chocolate chips.

Had to bake it in a bar pan as it rose quite a bit.  Took almost 40 minutes to cook, but was moist and delicious!!!  Topped it with whip cream and chocolate sauce and it was VERY sweet!!

We really enjoyed this. This should of been named "banana chocoalate chip cake bars" though. I cooked this for at least 30 minuetes or till it looked a little golden on top. This was still very soft and tend to fall apart easy. After leaving it in the frigde overnight, it became firm and it was perfect. Couldn't stop going back for more.

This is an excellent recipie!  The bananas and chocolate can both be tasted when you take the first bite; one doesn't overpower the other(which is a very good characteristic.) It was fluffy and when the chocolate is melted, it is heavenly!

These were delicious!!!!!  They taste like a cakey banana shortbread, if that makes sense.  VERY NUMMY!  I decreased both sugars to 1/2 cup each.  I also baked in a 9x13 in pan for 35 mins.  NUMMY!!!!

Absolutely perfect.  I served this for dessert to some guests last night and cut up the leftovers for other guests for brunch this morning.  For both settings, this cake/coffee cake fit right in and everyone complimented it!  I also used a 9x13 pan and baked longer than 20 min.

I made this according to recipe, didn't change a thing, except using a 9x13 baking dish, instead of the jelly roll pan.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  The cake was fluffy and had a nice banana flavor.  I thought it could use more chips (maybe they are settled into the other half of the cake?) but my husband liked it just the way it was.

I had a lot of very ripe bananas today and I pulled this recipe some time ago to try. I probably used a little over a cup of bananas. I used mini semi-sweet chips and drizzled chocolate icing over the top after I cut into small squares. I used the sugar cookie icing recipe from this site and just added a small amount of cocoa. They turned out lovely, tasted wonderful and moist and looked very nice with the drizzle. This is a very quick and easy recipe,will use again and again. Thanks Michele!

I also used a cookie sheet for lack of a jelly roll pan, and baked it for 15 minutes. This is a good choice for a quick dessert and most of the ingredients are readily on hand, making it a good way to use up old bananas.

Very good and easy to make.  I made this for dinner guests and made it look extra-nice by swirling chocolate syrup on the plate & then adding whipped cream on top.  A big hit!

Wow!  This is truly delicious.  It IS more cake-like than bar-like, but who cares?!  I took the advice of others and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup of each kind, and I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  This could not be more moist or delicious.  It was all  I could do to not eat the entire pan immediately!

Forgot to add baking soda and it was surprisingly a masterpiece! The whole family and the neighbors loved it! DITCH THE BAKING SODA! The taste is the same but it makes it nice and perfectly chewy like a cookie! Just be sure to cook it for an extra ten minutes.

Good stuff! Made it healthier by replacing the butter with applesauce and using white wheat flour. Also reduced the sugars to half a cup each. Baked in a 9x13 baking dish. Everyone loved it right out of the oven.

I made this after Thanksgiving...Looking for something that wasn't PIE & on the lighter side. This was perfect! I used whole wheat, substituted 1 T ground flaxseed & 3 T water for the egg, halved both the sugars & used applesauce instead of butter. It was AMAZING! I took them to a family gathering & they completely disappeared. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a perfect dessert for using up old bananas.  It came out moist and dense (like a muffin).  I stuck with the original recipe but cooked it in a 9x13 pan for an additional 10-15 mins (a recommendation from another reviewer.) When it was still warm out of the oven, I melted some more chocolate chips on the top, and sprinkled a layer of crystallized sugar which gave it a sweet, chocolatey crunch topping!  I brought it to work the next day, and everyone DEVOURED it...I even passed the recipe on to others cause they enjoyed it so much! I'll definitely make this again :)

Made it just like the recipe said (double batch) and it turned out perfect.  Doubled all ingredients except used 3.5 tsp baking powder, 4 frozen peeled ripe bananas.  Also had to bake it quite a bit longer than the time listed.  Double batch made 4 ramekins, 2 dozen minicupcakes and 8x8 bar pan.  My kids said it was their favorite new dessert.

After a long and hard day, I chose to try this recipe in spite of my daughters pleas to not make something with banana in it because it looked easy and fast...  Well--it was easy, fast, and so yummy, even my daughter can't keep her hands of them! I think I better make more!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  I didn't know if I would like this or not, but this is the BOMB! I followed the recipe exactly. I did  put  chocolate chips on top to melt  them spread them all over. I added cool whip on the top when served.  My family loved it!  This is a keeper.

this was excellent.  Didn't change any ingredients, just the pan...did not have jelly roll pan, used a 9 x 13.  Even better the next day...very moist.  Thanks for posting, will make again for sure it was a nice change from banana bread.

LOVED these!  They turned out so good!  I didn't have a jelly roll pan, either, so I just used a smaller cookie sheet.  I ended up having to cook them for closer to 30 minutes, though, they were still doughy after 20 minutes.  I will definitely make these again!

My god. This is fantastic! I added 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg, and before baking added a layer of crumbles (1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp butter, 1/4 tsp cinn, 2 tbsp flour) to the top. I also used a 9x13 pan so they took 28 minutes to fully cook. I am dreading my roommates coming home.. I know they will eat the whole thing by the time I am back from class!

Yum! I doubled the bananas, and spread warm chocolate icing over the top right when it came out of the oven. I poked holes in it and the icing soaked into it and made it addictive!

Scrumptious.  This will remain in my recipe box.  Baked like bars or moiist, cakey brownies in consistency which I like.  My changes were 1/2 cup Smart Balance and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of butter, 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugars, 1 cup white and 3/4 white- whole-wheat flour.  I also added 1/2 teas. of apple pie spice to compensate for the whole-wheat flavor.  Baked in 9 X 13 pan, 35 min. at 350.  Dusted with cocoa when cooled. Perfect!

This was so easy to make and so good! to make it a little more breakfast snack friendly I would add more banana and less choc. chips, but if it was for dessert like it says, I would keep it the same. SOOOOOOOOO good!

I have to say, the presentation was not great, but the easiness and taste of the recipe more than made up for it. I was a little puzzled with the servings, though. The exact amount of ingredients given, made just 8 servings for me! So, probably when it says 24, it means bite-size ones.

I followed most of the suggestions of tgparks to make them healthier.  My kids loved them but hubby and friends were underwhelmed.  I think the applesauce made them have a spoungey texture.  Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly and see what I think.

Good recipe, just wish I had followed advice and cut the sugar; it was a little too sweet and I didn't even use a full cup of chocolate chips. I baked in a muffin pan for exactly 20 minutes and they were perfectly done. I also used an egg-replacer. I'll make these again, with less sugar.

These are so tasty! I put quite a bit less sugar (no brown), more banana (1 1/2 cups?) and used part whole wheat flour. I had to bake them about 5-7 minutes longer, but that might be my oven. I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top. They turned out soft and cakey - so flavorful, and much quicker than cookies!

Okay..my husband freaked out that banana was made with chocolate.  I thought everyone knew they went together!  Otherwise, the kids and I like them pretty good.  They turned out fine, a little more cakey than I prefer.

Pretty good and very easy!  I wasn't in the mood to fuss with cookies, so this recipe was perfect.  I may try adding a thin layer of frosting next time, either banana or cream cheese.

My husband and daughter both really liked this.  I do not eat bananas so did not try it.  This is a great way to use up those over ripe bananas when you are tired of banana bread.  I used the jelly roll pan as the recipe is written, however since mine was dark I decreased the cooking temp by 25 degrees.  The dessert came out moist and spongy according to my husband.  My daughter who is picky ate two pieces.

Delicious! It's very cakey and not overly banana flavored - maybe because the bananas I used weren't super ripe. I also used a 9x13 pan and baked for 35 minutes. A great alternative to banana bread.

YUM!  My husband and I have been gobbling these up!  Like other reviewers, I used a 9x13 and cooked for about 25 minutes.  I used the Chocolate Icingfrom this site and the combination was heavenly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious.  I used a 9X9 stoneware pan instead of the jelly roll and added 10 minutes to the cooking time.  Just fabulous.  Had all the items in my pantry and was looking to use some "ripe" bananas!

Easy to make and sooo good!  A great use for really ripe bananas.  I've made it twice and used a 9 x 13 and 11 x 15 pan and it turned out great.  It's even better warmed up and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I made these exactly as the recipe listed and they came out great. Husband brought for a pot luck. I had to bake them about 20 minutes longer than called for. I agree with the description that they are a combination of a cookie and a bar. Came out quite cake like but tasted delicious. Not a fancy or sophisticated recipe and that's why I gave it 4 stars.

Had to bake it longer than the recipe stated.  Sprinkled it with powdered sugar to make it look pretty.

You need to soften the butter first. Maybe, add something else to taste because it taste a lot like bananas.

Really good! I made mine in a 9" round baking dish. It came out kind of like a banana brownie. I was afraid that it was just going to be like banana bread, but it wasn't at all. The consistency is really dense and sweet like a brownie. Yum!

If you're a chocolate lover you'll like this recipe even more. I bought mini chocolate chips and for me it was a little too overpowering. I would've preferred more of the banana flavor. It's still a great recipe. It was just a little too rich/heavy on the chocolate for my taste. Very sweet!

Pretty good recipe I’d make again. I cooked it in an 11”x17” pan and still had to cook it about 5-7 minutes longer. (I’m in a high altitude location, so maybe that was why?) It’s a nice change from banana bread, but was just slightly bland on its own. I think adding chocolate/whipped cream would have been a nice addition. I’d probably make a cream, add some chocolate, and truly make it as a jelly roll next time.

These came out Great! I followed the recipe, only I used a little more than a cup and a half of bananas because I had to use them up. I also used the rest of the bag of chocolate chips and poured it over the top after it was done baking and spread it out when it melted as an icing. When it cooled I put it in the frig. and the next day they were awesome! My Grandson is gonna love these :)

This was a good  bar cake but I thought the cooking time was not right.  20 mins  Get real.  I had to do 25 to 30 mins.  At that temp.  The cake was good and tasty and moist.  Not on my top list of things to do.

This is such a simple recipe. We've made it twice in a week. I guess you could say it's a cross between banana bread and chocolate chips. My cooking time is about 10 minutes longer. Don't know why and don't really care... and we normally can't wait for it to cool before cutting it! Very flavorful and makes the girls happy. that's all that count!

These didn't blow me away, but they were pretty good! They came out a light-cake consistency. I used a 9"x13" pan and that worked fine. I also used slightly less than a cup of chocolate chips and added some walnut pieces. It took a little over 30 minutes to cook. Quick and easy. I might make it again if I have old bananas that need to be used up.

Made this recipe as is, turned out great!  Not a healthy recipe by any means but others had mentioned using applesauce and whole wheat flour, I will try that next time.  Super moist and my picky boyfriend had seconds, all in all a great recipe, don't let the bland pictures stop you from making this.

The banana chocolate combination is delicious.  What i like about this recipe is that you can tweak it as you go... Add more banana; add more chocolate, etc... I have made this a few times and now always double the recipe for my family of 5.  Moist and delish! Thanks for a great brownie!

Followed directions. Turned out perfect in 9x13. It was a little more done on the outsides compared to the middle which was more dough like, but the flavor was all there. Yum! Thanks!

Excellent! I'm not a huge fan of banana bread, so I wanted to try this recipe. The 'cake-like' texture and buttery taste was wonderful. My husband wants it again, already!

Great recipe!  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and replaced the butter with 3/4 cup + 1 Tbsp applesauce.  This turned out awesome.

While this is tasty, I didn't think it was anything to write home about. I made it as per the recipe. I didn't find it too sweet, but that could be because the bananas I used weren't totally black. Just spotted. I did like the think, bar like appearance, and that I could taste both the chocolate and banana. Not sure I would make it again, but it was very easy, and most of the ingredients you're likely to have on hand.

Mmmm, yummy!  If you like chocolate, bananas, and dessert ... make these!  I made them with fresh bananas and it came out just fine.  Also, I let chocolate chips melt on top while it cooled and then spread them around ... I don't recommend this.  It was pretty messy.  But still delicious!  I DO recommend topping it with whipped cream.  That's great.  Anyways, I loved these cake-like bars.

I can't eat this (allergic to bananas) but my husband said it was good.  I put it in a 9X13 inch pan and cooked it for approx. 15 min. longer.  I dusted the milk chocolate chips with a bit of flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the pan.

One of the yummiest and easiest treats ever.  More like a light and fluffy bar cookie than a "dessert" but delicious no matter what you call it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My family inhaled them.

I, like other reviewers cut down significantly on the amount of sugar used.  I think the white sugar could be skipped altogether.  Other than that, this is a AMAZING recipe.  My husband and I could NOT stop eating these!

This recipe is fabulous!  The only change I made was to add some cinnamon and baked in a baking dish to get a fuller, fluffier cake.  This cake was soooo moist!  Thank you for posting it!

I reduced the sugars to half cup each as others mentioned and still found this too sweet. I would use less chocolate next time, less sugar, and/or just spread melted chocolate on top (and not mix it in the batter). I used a 10"x12" baking sheet in a mini oven and baked for 30 min.

This recipe was good.  I too did not have the jelly roll pan and so used a 9x13 instead.  I don't know that I would make it again.  I was expecting something more of a bar consistency, and this was more like a cake.  It just made it a little too delicate for my family.

We were not crazy about these.  I am sure part of this was my fault as I baked them in a dark pan and forgot to adjust the temp & baking time so they were too done.  That being said, I still don't know if we would have liked them that much better. We will stick with making banana bread or the wonderful banana cake from this site when we have old bananas around the house.

Tasty!  I recommend adding way more chocolate chips - 1 1/2 cups didn't seem enough to me (for a 9x13" pan); I think I might do 2 cups next time.  Then again, I'm a chocoholic and wanted to disguise the taste of banana.  My husband and I gobbled these up quickly.  Yum!

This recipe is fantastic! My boyfriend and I are always making it for dessert now. (We've convinced ourself it's extra healthy because of the bananas, haha)But we usually add caramel! Which is great. 

Wonderful dessert! Lost of props

Delightful! I used rotten bananas; I know...it sounds "icky." However, I find the flavor to be sweeter when the banana skin is 80% black and the inside has a few darkened spots. I suppose it's due to the production of oxides(oxidation-reduction). Whatever the cause, I'm happy it occurs and creates yummy goodies!

This cake was so moist and the perfect consistency. Like the others, I turned down the eat just a tad at the very end. I also used pecans instead of chocolate chips but thats just because I'm nuts :) It was amazing, and it's still moist after a few days!! Yum!

We loved these!  I was out of chocolate chips so I used butterscotch chips and they were absolutely yummy! I might try them sometime with chocolate chips, but we thought the butterscotch chips and bananas were a great flavor combination.

This is a fabulous recipe!  My husband and I loved it.  Here are the changes I made after reading all the previous reviews: I used a 9x13 inch cake pan (I thought a jelly roll pan would have been too big).  I omitted the salt because I used salted butter, and I used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.  I used 3 mashed bananas because I wanted it to have a little more banana flavor, and it made the cake really moist.  My last alteration was to use half semi sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate-mostly because that's what I had in the cupboard.  I took it out right at 20 minutes and it was perfect!

This was a nice change from the normal.  I had some bananas that I needed to use up. I was tired of doing the same thing.  I liked it but I think it would have been very good served warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. I might have to do that next time.

This was really good, but not to die for.  I used less sugar (about 30% less), because my bananas were VERY ripe an sweet.  Next time I'll probably try the amount called for, just to see what difference it makes.
We ate it with ice cream and chocolate sauce on top and that pulled it all together for me.

This recipe was fantastic! I substituted 1/3 c. Splenda for the 2/3 c. white sugar and it tasted great. My husband thought it was better than any banana bread recipe I've made before. Definitely a keeper.

These were very good!  Perfect for a bake sale because they can be cut easily into squares with no mess.  My whole family loved them.

Good & moist!  I rated 4 stars since it was so crumbly and I wouldn't say it was the BEST banana bread I've ever had.  I made it in a 9x13 pan (as another reviewed suggested) and cooked it for an extra 15 minutes (test the center w/ a knife or toothpick).  I only added chocolate chips to half (sprinkled all over the top) since I would rather have just banana bread but the kids would love chocolate chips.  Nice snack for the kids.  I'd make it again.

This was pretty disappointing for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to cook it for a good 15 minutes more to get it cooked all the way through.  Something about the taste was just off, and the texture reminded me of greasy cake.  Next time I have extra bananas I'll stick with the Banana Crumb Muffins from this site.

BF did n't think the bananas were strong enough but I thought it was just right. Served more like brownies, had no cream or ice cream. Baked in a 9 x13 and took about 15 min longer. Very moist...will make again.

Love this recipe. It's my go-to for those slightly over-ripened (ok, black) bananas I never ate in time. I use about 1/2 cup more bananas and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips extra. Never have a problem.

this was outstanding!  Whenever my SIL and I get together we always bake banana bread but today I wanted something different!  This was it!  We both loved it!  I cooked it in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes.  Like a muffin in the shape of a bar!  DELICIOUS!

OH MY GOD. This was better than I could have imagines. I also used a 9x13 pan and it came out wonderfully. I used 2 meduim sized bananas (probably 1 1/2 cups worth) and it really gave it that banana kick! I only cooked for 20 minutes and thought it was done, but it probably could have used another few to firm up the bottom (probably the xtra banana!)  It was hard not to eat the entire pan myself. Will be making this for many events to come.

I didn't expect the cake-like texture, I thought it would be more of a chocolate chip cookie bar type thing - but this is amazing!  It is my absoulte favorite dessert now - not too heavy, but has a lot of flavor!

My immediate family did not like these a whole lot.  The chocolate chips overpowered the banana taste, and it was a bit dry.  I cooked in a 9x13 dish.  However, I did have some relatives who relished them.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top to compliment the chocolate banana taste and to provide a nice golden top.

I also had to bake it for about 40min but it was good! It will be good with walnuts in it also. Next time, I will put walnuts in it and bake it in a thinner cookie sheet for a crispier finish.

This dessert is one of my all time favorites.  I found this recipe about a year ago, and it has been often requested by my roommate and boyfriend.  I make it Vegan with Egg Replacer (commerical product) and my friend Elisabeth tells me that she will break up with her boyfriend and marry me.  Its that good.  
You should know, it does not do the banana chocolate chip dessert justice if not served warm topped with whip cream/cool whip.  20 seconds in the microwave, and I am in heaven.

If you you like banana bread and chocolate you should like this one.  I'm not really into banana bread, but I gave some to people who likes banana bread and they liked it.
