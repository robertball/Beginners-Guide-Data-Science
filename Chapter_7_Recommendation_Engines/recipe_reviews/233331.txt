I tried it exactly as written and it was good but the cheese sauce was so watery.  I just watched the video of tips from Utokia on how to make this and she did not include the 2 ice cubes that are in this recipe.  Nothing like watching the video after you have made it.  I may try this again without the ice cubes.  It is great for clean up.
