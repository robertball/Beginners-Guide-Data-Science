I submitted this recipe so long ago that I forgot that I did!lol  Just wanted to add that you do not necessarily need to use heavy whipping cream - good ole' milk will do the trick.  My wonderful Mother-in-Law gave me this recipe almost 28 years ago and I just love it!  I have never seen another one quite like it and everyone who tries it at potluck and church functions always wants the recipe.  It goes well with just about everything.  Enjoy!!

We LOVED this recipe!!! I made a few additions: since our garden is giving with abundance, I added 2 large, ripe tomatoes cut up with the cucumber, and a small bunch of fresh chives-finely cut up (about 1-2 Tbsp) then marinated the 2 hrs as the recipe stated. Poured off the marinate solution, and followed this recipe except used 2 green onions equaling 2 Tbsp instead of 3 Tbsp. I shall use this recipe often!!! Thank you---we really loved it!!

My husband loved it. This is how my mother used to make cucumbers, but with sliced onion. I had gotten sway from the vinegar, and just soak my cucumbers and onions in salt water, but my husband liked this recipe better. Just goes to prove, Mom knows best. Thanks for reminding me.

This was just okay for me.  I like cream cucumbers, but  usually I use a simpler recipe so I thought I would try this.  It was good, but not worth the extra work and ingredients.

Tried this recipe for a change from my steadfast marinaded  cucumber recipe. I added green peppers to the cucumbers, then followed the recipe. This is a great summertime salad and will be severed often.

I enjoyed these!  Although, I wouldn't mince the onions next time but would slice them instead and lessen the oil.  It was good overall for a mayo based cucumber salad; it had a subtle basil taste.

I have been looking for a cucumber salad recipe for a long time. My Dad was a wonderful cook and he never wrote down any of his recipes. I make a lot of his food by memory but, the one I haven't been able to make was this one. As soon as I saw that this was made with heavy cream, it all came back to me. I will try this recipe and hopefully it will be just like his or close to it. The one thing I do remember was he would put the sliced cucumbers in a colander then in the fridge for a few hours so the water would drain out of the cucumbers before mixing.  Can't wait to try this!
