This was really good!  A nice fresh summer pasta recipie.  I used broccoli instead of squash, whole wheat penne to make it a bit healthier, and two pork tenderloins instead of chops.  It is a really low fat, but delicious recipie.  I had to add a 28 oz. can of tomatoes though.  This is definitley a keeper!

We all loved this - I wish I could give it more stars! I - for once - followed the recipe exactly lol. My husband's only comment was that maybe another can of diced tomatoes would be the only change he'd make. It was so tasty though, and lots of good veggies for a nice well balanced meal. We used whole wheat shells too.

Great recipe! I did make a few changes, though... First, wait to start the water for the pasta until your sauce is simmering. That way, everything is ready at the same time. Secondly, brown the pork for five minutes, then add the diced/chopped veggies and garlic and cook 3-4 minutes altogether. Helps intensify and meld the flavor. You can replace the tomato sauce with Snap-E-Tom (or Spicy V-8) for some extra kick. PS: The red wine adds a robust flavor to the sauce; definitely keep it in. This was a great recipe; will definitely go in the rotation!

Since the sauce takes 35 minutes to simmer, do not boil your noodles until the last 15 minutes of the sauce simmer. I added capers and used fire roasted diced tomatoes. This sauce has a full-bodied flavor and is very good.

Excellent summer meal - I left out the mushrooms for my BF, used fresh tomatoes instead of sauce and canned chopped and used spirals instead of shells, and sized the recipe for 4. Delicious and healthy.

This was good.  A little too much basil for me - I only used 2 TBS.  I used one pork loin.

Was a little bland for my liking. I prefer my food flavorful and even with all the herbs the flavor just wasn't there for me.

I made this last night for dinner and it was ok.  I follwed the recipe pretty much exactly except for I didnt have the red wine and I used more seasoning (to keep it from being bland).  It was ok, nothing special.  My bf didn't mind it.  It had flavor but just wasn't as great as I thought.  Just tasted like a tomato sauce over pasta.

This pretty much tastes like an oregano filled tomato.  I think there is hope though.  Next time, I'll follow the advice of reviewers and use spicy V8 instead of tomato sauce and paste.  I'll be more careful with the oregano, too, and hopefully I'll be more impressed.

This is a very good recipe. Put the vegetables in a little after starting to cook so they don't get soggy.

Excellent!  Great flavor & pretty healthy, too.  I stuck to the recipe this time.  This one's a keeper.  I may add more tomatoes next time just to give s bit more sauce but, otherwise -perfect balance of flavors.

I made this with the following changes
  - I had no tomato sauce so I used three single serving cans of V-8
  - I used a pork loin roast of a little over 2 pounds.  Plenty of meat 
-- Used 2 teaspoons of dried basil 
  - I ate it without the Parmesan topping (I forgot) but my hubby ate it with and we both liked it 

My household loved this dinner.  Hubby actually commented several times while eating.  I usually have to ask how he likes it for a new recipe.  
  It's a keeper.
