All in all this was a great recipe but I do however feel it needs more spices to bring out the flavor. Super simple though so play around with it and adjust it to your liking...

Great recipe, I doubled the salsa part of it and added a few extra guajillo chiles, one pasilla, and threw in a Chile ancho. Also, I added a little achiote  to the blended ingredients, just for fun. I substituted 8 chicken thighs with skin instead of chicken breast because I prefer chicken on the bone. Just tastes better in my opinion. Once it cooked in salsa for an hour I pulled the chicken thighs out of the salsa and put them on a baking sheet to broil for a few minutes to give it a little more of a grilled flavor. Then I threw them back in the salsa to serve with Mexican rice. Excellent recipe and I will make it again!
