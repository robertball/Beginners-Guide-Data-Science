So good! I didn't use potatoes or peas. I used green beans from the garden with the carrots and brussel sprouts. I am making it again right now! Delicious:) Everyone loved this!

Wow! Made tonight and saved me from having to prepare the same old steamed Brussels Sprouts, which my husband requires. Made according to recipe but had no potatoes (didn't have). Used jarred Thyme. Added frozen peas a few minutes before done and then added Spinach at the very last second - not as directed.
