I've never had better frozen corn!  I used onion, as I didn't have shallots and half and half instead of cream to lower the fat content.  Served it with smoked pork ribs and potato salad.  Yum Yum!

Easy to prepare and the cream added a nice taste and texture. Unfortunately we found this to be bland. I'll try this again with extra shallots.

I couldn't figure out why this didn't have a higher rating until I read closer that it calls for frozen corn.  I was searching for a home made creamed corn recipe so I had fresh corn & cut it off of the cob.  It was spectacular!!  I was short an ear & supplemented with about a 1/2 cup frozen kernels & you could totally tell which ones came from a bag.  I highly recommend using fresh.  I didn't use the nutmeg cuz I wasn't in the mood but followed the rest to a tee & can't wait to serve this at holidays.  The corn was the star & the shallots added amazing depth of flavor!  Thank you so much!  :o)

I liked the base of this recipe.  I added fresh garlic when I sauteed the onions (what I had), skipped the nutmeg, and added garlic salt at the finish.  Wonderful!

A perfect, simple side dish to accompany our dinner tonight! I measured nothing... I used white onion since it's all I had on hand and skipped the sugar. For extra flavor and color (and cuz I know we like it), I skipped the water and let the corn and onion get a little charred before stirring in the remaining ingredients...yum! Time to eat!

Great recipe.  We added 4 oz of cream cheese to make it "creamier corn" and my kids LOVED it!

We hated this, I cooked it exactly to the directions and the flavors didn't mix well at all.

good but not great.A welcomed change to everyday corn. Everyone tried it almost everyone had seconds. It needs something to add color to the presentation. Next time I will add green chilis and some diced red pepper I would. rate this an A

this is my 1st time trying this recipe. It says it takes about 8 minutes for the cream to thicken but my question is~how thick does it get and does it get thicker after removing from heat? I weighed all ingredients out before hand and its been longer then 8 minutes and it is still slightly liquefied

Never had shallots before & loved the new taste.  Husband loved too.
