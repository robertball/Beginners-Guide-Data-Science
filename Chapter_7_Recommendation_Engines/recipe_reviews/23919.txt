By looking at the current picture, you'd probably wonder why this has so many positive reviews.  Well I've made this three times now and it's never looked like the big ole hunk of pooey that's pictured.  I do have some recommendations: use a loaf pan, double the gaahlic, and I sometimes spice it up with ground pepperoni in the beef or add mushrooms to the cheese.  It's also VERY important to use lean beef or you end up draining all the cheese along with the grease.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe.  We have been making this for years and love it!  It's a tried and true, never-fail, company pleasing, favorite.  You can even prepare it (not bake) in the morning or night before and store it the fridge until it's time to cook it.  You do need to cook a little longer since you are starting with very cold ingredients.
Update:  I just made this again last night.  The original recipe that I have has 2 cloves of garlic and 3/4 tsp of oregano. It also uses shredded mozzerella in the middle and slices on the top. Wonderful recipe!  I'm glad it's on here.

Great!  I added some spinach along with the ham and mozzarella and it was a great touch.

I got this recipe from a friend in college manay moon ago and had lost it.  I am so happy to see this recipe as it is my favorite way to make meatloaf.  I highly reccomend this and the only thing I would suggest is to use a meat thermometer to check for doneness.  The tomato juice and ham give it a pinkness that makes it hard to tell when it's done.  This recipe will be appearing on my menu this week!!!

Great recipe. I followed it pretty closely, but changed it as follows: Used 3 oz Prosciutto instead of ham. Used provolone instead of mozz. Added 1 sliced green onion, sprinkled on the meat before the ham. Used 1.5lb 97% ground beef and .5 lb mild Italian sausage. Only had to bake mine for 60 minutes, also. Next time I'll probably skip the salt, but overall a good recipe!

There is one thing that makes this recipe better, and that's creativity. Every time I make this, I fiddle around and it's always great. Try using prosciutto ham, salami or prosciutto salami for the inside meat. I've added Italian sausage filling to the ground beef with great results. I also like to add sun dried tomatoes or mushrooms inside as well. On fancier occasions I've been known to serve it on top of a bed of spaghetti with burnt butter and parmesan.

Made this a few times and its a hit every time.  A great twist on boring meatloaf!!  I omit the tomato juice, though.  And it doesn't seem to miss it!  Don't like the taste of tomato juice in the meatloaf and tomato juice actually reacts badly with aluminum foil if you're using it.  A great variation is to use smoked ham!  Very tasty.

This meatloaf was tasty and very rich.  I added a bit of parmesan romano blend to my meatloaf mix to make it taste like I would make my meatballs.  I enjoyed the cheese (I used provolone), however the deli ham tasted a bit out of place in my opinion.  I may not add meat next time, or if I do I might consider capicola or some Italian deli meat.  The rolling method went easier than I expected and I served this with penne tossed with homemade sauce, I also put a little sauce on the meatloaf before I topped with the cheese slices.

Excellent recipe. Very similar to what I've had in Sicily. I've since changed it from meat roll to meat rolls however. Rather than ending up with one large loaf, I've made rolls of 5x3 - 5x5 inches. Using one piece of ham and cheese, rolled, then breaded, then fried in a skillet. This is more of what I've been accustomed to having in Sicily. Nonetheless, the taste in either format is divine and delicious.

I made a half recipe of this last week but somehow I read the ham and cheese wrong and ended up using double what I should have...oops. It was still fantastic, although I'll probably just make a full recipe next time (with the correct amount of ham and cheese) so I have more to freeze for leftovers. I followed a tip from Caroline C. and served it with marinara sauce. It was great! I like finding new variations on meatloaf because both my husband and I love it. Thanks Kimber!

I was a bit scared about the rolling part as I was only making it with 16oz of ground beef. I should have had more faith in myself - I rolled it on/with parchment paper, and it turned out fine! The flavor was very good but it was rather dry - just as well I served it with 'Chunky Marinara Sauce.' Thank you, Kimber and Betsy for a great meal!

The meat mixture in this recipe was amazing.  I added additional garlic, used Italian bread crumbs, tomato sauce thinned with sauce water (no tomato juice), and salami instead of ham since it seemed more Italian and therefore a better choice.  It was a good recipe and the salami wasn’t bad, but I found its taste to be a bit overpowering.  I’d use salami again, but use less next time.  In retrospect, I don’t think ham would be bad after all since it has a nice mild flavor to it.  Maybe that was why it was in the recipe in the first place? :)  By the way, this was really easy to make!

This looked like it might be a challenge to put together, but it turned out to be so quick and easy! I used Canadian bacon instead of ham, upped the garlic and added onion powder to the meat mixture as well. This was a real hit. Next time I may even add some sauteed spinach, mushrooms and roasted red peppers to the filling.

My first meat roll and it was really good! I changed a few things, I added 1 tablespoon of italian seasoning, and instead of ham I used mushrooms and slightly cooked spinach. Enjoy!

This dish is absolutely wonderful. I thought it  was gonna be a little difficult when using ground meat instead of a cut to roll, but it was actually very easy. I did not have the ham or tomato juice on hand so I left them out and used sharp cheddar instead of mozz. cheese. I threw a spoonful of homemade red gravy on top with a little bit of parm. cheese. My husband loved it. Definitely a keeper.

I omitted the tomato juice and instead served it drizzled with a marinara sauce and liked it much better that way.  It was a HUGE family hit, kids and adults alike and will find its way to our table many times in the future, I'm sure!

Pretty tasty but a lot of the cheese escaped.  Next time I need to be sure I roll it tighter.

Pretty good. I like the choice of spices, works very well.  I don't see the cheese and the ham as necessary, though.  there are much better recipes out there for stuffed meatloaf than this one.  But omitting the cheese and ham, I would definitely make this again.

Made a couple of changes - used only about a pound and a quarter lean ground beef so only used 1 egg and substituted tomato sauce for the juice. I also used a shredded italian cheese mixture instead of just mozzarella. I poured the rest of the can of sauce on top when I added the cheese during the last few minutes of cooking (which only took about 50 - 55 minutes because it was a smaller loaf). Delish!

YUM! I used prosciutto ham which made it a bit more salty, but yummy !!!  I also used a tomato sauce flavored with onion and garlic instead of tomato juice.. I also put a little bit of the mixture on top, as well.  And fresh oregano, instead of dried.  Can't wait to make it again!  Super easy!

My B-I-L made this last night and it was amazing. So much so I had to go online and look for the recipe this morning. His creative additions were prosciutto and sd toms, very good. I was thinking that one could sneak some shredded veggies into the meat mixture as well.

Since I was a kid, this is the ONLY meatloaf that I will eat.  It's actually pretty easy to make as well.  My husband loves it too and won't eat any other meatloaf now either (since I don't make any other meatloaf....)

I suggest everyone make this I left out the tomato juice and topped with marinara sauce baked in a bread/loaf pan. My husband said never make regular meatloaf ever again. My picky 2 yr old ate a whole slice. IT IS GREEEEAAAATTT

I love making this!  Reminds me of my mothers.  I have made some edits over the years but it still taste amazing.  I do recommend using two gloves of garlic and a little more oregano or mixed Italian seasoning (especially if you are using extra lean meat).  I personally used extra lean ground turkey which nix the grease all together.  If using turkey i recommend using italian flavored bread crumbs to add to the flavor a little.  I also plan prefer tomato sauce instead of juice.

My mom has been cooking this since I was a kid, nearly 40 years now, since a fellow Air Force wife made it.  I was about to type mine into my Recipe Box when I checked and saw this one was perfect!  
We eat it all the time.

I haven't made it yet and already I'm making changes;)  Instead of tomato juice, I think I'll use tomato sauce or puree.  That might help with the sometimes metallic taste that tomato juice has. Other reviews use different cheeses, meats and even add spinach, which sounds great.  I might even try it with ground turkey!

This is a wonderful, easy and extremely tasty recipe! It's turned into my "signature" dish and so far everyone has loved it from my two young children to my French Mother-in-Law and that's something!

The meat part wasn't anything exciting and I've definitely liked some other meatloaf recipes better.  But this was interesting and different, and it "presents" well.  Unfortunately the added cheese just makes it that much more fattening.  The rolling is easy, as long as you take advantage of that waxed paper, keeping it intact with the roll until it absolutely must be pulled off bit-by-bit as it gets in the way.

This is just wonderful! Thanks for the lovely idea. It is so easy and looks incredible. I used proscutto, because I had a bunch of it in the house, and provolone. I also took a page from another reviewer and made some marinara which I poured over it. I have made it twice now. Mmmm.

we enjoyed this recipe - a different way to make meatloaf.  i subbed ground turkey, and left the ham out on one half of the meatloaf (i don't like ham -ou could just cheese on my side!) i thought the meat had good flavor, although i think you could increase the spices to add to the "italian" flavors.  overall very good - kids and the whole family quite enjoyed this!

I made this for my family and everyone LOVED it. I'm not really a cook, so if I can do this, and do it well, then anyone can. Next time I think I'll serve it with a side of marinara sauce and maybe add a bit more seasoning to the meat. I will make it again, for sure.

I tried this for supper. I used a pound of venison, a pound of ground pork, Italian bread crumbs, added onion powder, and didn't add ham. It was the prettiest meatloaf I've ever made. I did use a loaf pan and cooked to 165° because of the pork. I served with pasta in rosa sauce and spinach for sides. My husband gave it a thumbs up!

This was great meatloaf!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I used shredded mozzarella layered with spinach (1 package, thawed and drained) for the inside and tomato sauce instead of tomato juice (and poured the rest of the can over the meatloaf in the last 15 minutes).  Yummmmmm!

A great alternative to traditional meatloaf. I serve it with red pasta sauce to bring out the great flavors of the meat, ham and cheese.

Something new and tasty in the meat loaf department. The house smells so good while this is cooking! A great NEW way to prepare and actually enjoy meatloaf. Thumbs up! I'll be making this one again tho with maybe a variation or two. Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  If you're looking for something even more out of the ordinary for meatloaf- use italian sausage (replace about a pound to a pound and a half of the ground beef with it) and swiss cheese.  
A company pleaser either way- great for impressing mothers-in-law.

Pretty good.  Easy to make and different for a meatloaf, but the meat itself was a litle bland.  Will probably add some additional seasonings and herbs next time. Thanks!

I made this last night for supper. My husband who thinks I'm a pretty good cook, said this was excellent. I changed a few ingredients b/c that what I had on hand. I used ground turkey and cheddar cheese in the filling.Also, I poured half a jar of good quality tomato and basil commercial spaghetti sauce over the top before baking.This is a keeper! Thanks.

My family and I loved it! We have four little girls who can be pretty picky and they all cleared their plates and even asked for more!! The only thing I might do different next time is a little bit less of the oregano but thats it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Kimber!

This is a GREAT recipe! It's easy and delicious. I added some roasted bell peppers to the filling(I guess next time I can add some sliced mushrooms) and there were no left overs. Thanks a lot for this recipe.

I made 2 of these meat rolls last night for my husband and kids (all 8 of them) What a home run this was! Being the pepperoni freaks that they are, I also topped the ham and cheese with pepperoni and drizzled pizza sauce on top when it was done baking. This is definetly a keeper in my house! Thanks Kimber

Yes, I used Panko Bread Crumbs instead and I Diced 1/2 of a Small Onion, also I used V-8 Tomato Juice and added 1/4 cup of Ketchup to mixture , plus 1 tsp. of Dry Basil too.
It turned out great!

We made this last night as part of a catered dinner. We prepped the whole thing before  and wrapped it up in foil. We actually baked it in the foil which prevented the cheese  from escaping. When it came up to temp we unwrapped it, put the cheese on top and finished it off in the oven. We used  ground sirloin and prosciutto instead of ham.  Even though there were two other entrees and a huge pan of roasted vegetables this was the one entree that was completely gone at the end of the meal.

Great recipe. Easy to make and a great spin on boring meat loaf. I put it over spaghetti with a marinara sauce.

An excellent reprieve from boring meatloaf - very moist and delicious - was so popular there were no leftovers. Served with whipped potatoes (with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese), garden salad, and stewed tomatoes.

I've made this many times, and it never fails to please.  Everyone has loved it. I've made it with ground sirloin and ground turkey, both turn out great.  Pairs well with pasta or garlic mashed potatoes. Comfort food at its best!

I discovered this recipe years ago in one of the little cookbooks you get from the check out line at the grocery store. I was a Nanny then looking for meals the kids would eat.  It was a hit then and now with my own family.

Funny!  I thought this was a secret family recipe.  I can't wait to share this with the rest of the family.

Oh yeah...this is a great meatloaf.  :)
