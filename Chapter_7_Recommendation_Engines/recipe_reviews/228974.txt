Everyone in my family absolutely loves this recipe!  I get rave reviews every time I make it and it's always the first thing to go.  I usually make it in a slow cooker though.  Couldn't bring myself to use the microwave!  I don't change much in the recipe except I used white rice instead of wild.  I also skip the onions when I use the slow cooker (they'd be soggy).  When I bake it in the oven though, the onions are PERFECT in this recipe.

I tampered with the recipe a bit. I added chicken and used real cheese and a can of milk. I cooked my chicken with pepper and garlic salt and a hint of freshly squeezed lemon. I also baked on 350Â° for 45 mins. It's delicious.

Great recipe! My son doesn't like onions, or french fried onions, so I sprinkled bacon bits on top instead. He LOVES bacon, so it was an instant hit...thanks!

Excellent - used what I had on hand (white rice instead of wild, breadcrumbs instead of onion rings). Baked in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes. (Added about a half a can of milk because I was worried it would dry out.)  Was devoured by my husband, children and grandchild. Don't be afraid to use more broccoli than called for to yummily sneak even more veggies into your diet. Good stuff.

I did make a couple of changes just because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  I used cream of celery soup instead of chicken.  I used white rice and left out the celery.  I cooked the onions most of the way before adding to the rest of the ingredients.  I also baked it in the oven as well.  I baked the majority of the time covered and then un-covered and added the french fried onions for a few more minutes at the end.  I usually try not to make so many changes when I first try a recipe, but I really don't think they would have changed the overall flavor.  Tasty!

This isn't a bad recipe, but it would work much better with a couple of tweeks. Do yourself a favor and use high quality cheese. Any low quality processed cheese just isn't going to give you as delicious a casserole as a high quality cheese would. I did follow the recipe by cooking it in the microwave, but I believe I will either use the oven or stovetop next time. I like the idea of just popping something in the microwave, but the microwave has a tendency to render things stringy and rubbery, so I think I could get a smoother casserole in the oven. In general, I did enjoy this recipe though, and I will make it again, I'll just change up those two things.

I loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except, omitted the celery because I didn't have any, doubled the rice and reduced the fried onions down to about 1/2 a cup (to reduce calories).  I also added in some boneless chicken thighs to make this a full meal.  As other reviewers recommended, I did add a little milk to keep if from drying out, but only added about a 1/4 of a soup can.  I cooked at 350 for 45 minutes and it turned out great.  I will definitely make again.

I changed this recipe a bit as I wanted it to an all-in-one casserole. 1 cup of raw rice, (cooked in rice cooker first), bunch of broccoli, 2 chicken breasts, seasoned, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and a cup of shredded cheese (I used habanero for flavor).

Baked at 375 degrees for an hour and it was great!

This is comfort food!  I absolutely love this casserole.  Did make a few changes, though.  I added a can of mushrooms and a can of chicken breast meat.

Wonderful delicious and relatively healthy dish. I sauteed the onion and celery first then combined all with fresh (steamed) cauliflower, broccoli and cooked  brown rice. I added diced ham and used a good cheddar instead of processed cheese. Then baked it and topped with the french fried onions. Really delicious!

Made this for a late Christmas get-together. I decided to go ahead and bake it, just because I had the time, and that's how I've always done it. Overall, it was very good. I messed up a little and added salt, not realizing that the pre-cooked wild rice I was using was already seasoned. So, it was a little salty for my taste, but again, the recipe doesn't call for salt. :) The only other change was that I added some grated cheddar cheese, both to the dish and on top. I didn't measure, just threw in a handful. It made it very cheesy and rich. The family loved it and my daughter even asked if she could keep the leftovers at her house. So, I will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe exactly as written....minus the celery. Very tasty and a big hit at our house. Will definitely make again.
