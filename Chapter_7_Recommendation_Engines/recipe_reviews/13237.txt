We loved this dish.  Used Halibut and it turned out super yummy...  Even our three year old liked it.  My husband added mushrooms and garlic..  Can't wait to have it again.

This chowder is a full meal deal with flavor to spare.  Feel free to inovate with seafoods that are in season or more reasonable.  If you do look for a variety of textures and flavor.

My husband loved this chowder!  I'm not a fish person, and I used cod, so it was kind of fishy tasting, but I could tell that the base was good and that if I use flounder or haddock next time, which are milder, this will be outstanding for me.  My husband said I could serve this to company!  I think I'll try the potatoes next time and leave out the cream, because I like a tomato type base better than creamy.  I just made this today and I'm going to try again this weekend with a few modifications because I think I'll really like this with a milder fish!  Thanks Corwynn!  I'm always looking for something new and good!

This chowder requires a lot of ingredients and chopping but is relatively quick.  If I made it again I wouldn't use the light cream.  Halibut takes delicious in the broth.

I made some minor changes, and loved this!  I used Haddock, added cubed red potatoes,corn and 3 cloves chopped garlic. I also used a can of diced tomatoes (subbed for the whole tom.) and used a bit more salt and rosemary.  We had friends over and they couldn't get enough.  Thanks for a great one!

Outstanding!  I have been making this for years and everyone that has ever tried it loved it.   A great first course if you are doing a nice dinner party.   No matter how you adjust the recipe (fish, veggie quantity, etc) it always comes out tasting like an expensive restaurant dish.

I made this last weekend and it was pretty good. I used diced tomatoes vs whole peeled and I also added 3 medium sized white potatoes cut into small cubes.  For the fish, I used halibut and I didn't add into the pot until after 6-7 hours of cooking.  No need to cook the fish the entire time.  I had planned on adding some peas and forgot - will add next time.  And I ended up using 1/4C of skim milk vs the cream.  The taste was ok so I would advise adding pepper and salt to taste.  Once I did that, the taste was awesome.  Will make this again.

excellent - not a fan of fish, but will make this time and again as this chowder carries the flavor of the fish (used fresh water fish) but does not overwhelm and retains the concept of a chowder, not fish with a sauce.  served for friends and was rewarded with raves.

Wow is this delicious.  I have a strict diet gluten-free / dairy-free diet and had to substitute the butter, flour and cream.  For the butter I used margarine, for the flour I used a GF standard mix and for the cream I used light coconut milk.  I was not sure how that would all work out in this meal.    IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! By far one of the best slow cooker recipes we have made.  My husband and I both work (luckily have a programmable slow cooker) and it sat on warm for 3 hours before we could get to it.  None of the meal was dry and the flavor was spot on.    I look forward to trying this with other types of seafood.  Great Recipe!

We used northern pike in this recipe, added a couple diced potatoes and substituted karoway seeds for the rosemary.  OUTSTANDING!

This was a great recipe- easy and delicious.  Whole family enjoyed it.  Used whole milk rather than cream, maybe saved a couple of calories, and bay scallops & shrimp instead of fish.

I used mahi mahi since I had it on hand (any firm white fish will do) and this chowder was wonderful!  Next time I think I'll use halibut or cod since they have a milder flavor.  It's incredibly savory with the tomatoes, clam juice, and white wine creating a broth that begs to be soaked up with a nice crusty bread.  I wouldn't change anything, and will definitely make this again.

A very tasty soup.  I added shrimp and clams along with an extra jar of clam juice as the recipe looked skimpy as the soup was cooking.  It turned out great and I plan to make it again using other types of seafood.

This was sooo good!  I made a few minor changes...made it on the stove top, added some diced potatoes and corn, just because I had some in the fridge, leftover.  Also used half cod and half whiting, again because it's what I had on hand.  It was a huge hit!

After reading quite a few of the reviews, I was sure I would enjoy this.  Afterall, we are a family of cod eaters.  Well, I think my expectations were too high.  I followed the recipe as is, but found it too bland.  We didn't find it too fishy, just not alot of flavor.  I ended up adding more seasoning, and some tabasco sauce.  It was OK, but unfortunately, I won't be making this again.  Sorry

Love this recipe and I make it often.  As I live in Australia, I replace the cod with mixed seafood (usually from the supermarket) and firm white-flesh fish like flathead (caught locally). I also replaced the clam juice with fish stock.  You just can't go wrong with this great slow cook!

This was GREAT!!  I cooked the vegetables, herbs, clam juce and wine during the day in the crock pot, then added the cubed fish during the last hour.  Flour, butter and cream at the end.  I also added 5 baby red potatoes.  This soup is really good!  A nice crockpot addition.

Had very good flavor.  I used cod which at first tastes a bit fishy, so next time I might try using a different fish.  I added two potatoes and I think it was a very good addition.  Made it a bit more substantial.  The only white wine I had was white zin and I think it was fine.  Would try a dryer wine if I have it next time.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  The cod held up well in the slow cooker.

This dish turned out so well! I ended up doubling the recipe and saving the rest for a future week’s meal prep. I added about 3 cups more carrots and celery to incorporate more veggies. To decrease the fat content, I substituted butter with nonfat Greek yogurt at a 1:2 ratio (in place of 6 tablespoons of butter, I used 3 tablespoons of yogurt). I added a few dribbles of olive oil; the dish tasted no different than a buttered version. I added arrowroot starch in order to thicken the chowder.

I would say I'd give this recipe 3 1/2 stars, if I could. I liked it enough to eat it, but I don't know if I will make it again. I was a bit skeptical about fish in a crockpot, but it actually did not taste strange, like I thought it would. Although, I think the time( 7 to 8 hrs on low) was too long. I guess the 3-4- hours on high would have been better because before the 7 hours, my fish became kind of mushy. Sometime around the last 2 hours I added a couple of quartered red potatoes. Nice addition, in my opinion. I have to admit, my house smelled incredible. My husband really enjoyed this, my kids...not so much. I didn't think they would. Me, well, although I liked it, and it came together very easily, I will keep looking for a fish chowder recipe that my family will all enjoy.

By sauteing the veggies (in the butter you're supposed to add later), and baking the fish, I was able to put this chowder together on the stove top in about 1/2hr. Didn't have wine or clam juice and it *still* came out yummy! Fish of the day was perch, and other than having to de-bone after baking, it was very, very tasty.

This was yummy!  I had some broiled northern pike I needed to use.  It was already broiled with lemon, olive oil, crushed garlic, and sliced ginger.  Since it was already cooked, I did not get out the crock-pot, I simply threw all ingredients in a large pot and simmered for 30 minutes.  I did try it both with the cream and without.  It was good both ways, but we opted to leave out the cream for the majority of the soup.  I didn't use the flour to thicken because as others mentioned, it was already very thick.  I did throw in the butter though!  It was very tasty and a great way to use up the pike.

The soup was a hit with my husband. I added some ole bay and creole seasonings to give it some added flavor. He can't wait to have it again!

It was a very good chowder with an enticing aroma, but slightly on the bland side.  Some salt, pepper and Sherry  helped after the first couple of bites.  I will definitely do it again, but experiment with some spices to add some depth - perhaps saffron.

I added cubed cod after it had cooked at least 3-4 hrs.  I added cubed potatoes right at the beginning but they really weren't done at the end.  Either leave out or parboil them before you add.  I   Kenny also suggested adding rice.

This was just okay. Make sure you like the flavor of the fish you use as the flavor permeates the entire soup. I used cod and did not like the flavor it gave to the soup. Don't cut the fish up too small as it shrinks considerably in the crock pot. I also liked the flavor of the soup better before I added the flour and cream. Not sure if I would make this again.

My fish ended up chewy and made the soup unappealing. The broth on it's own however, was fine.

I'm a seafood lover and I'll admit disappointment with this recipe. The first time I made it, I used cod and rainbow trout. It smelled wonderful and had a nice flavor but felt like it was missing something, I've made it two more times since then.. the second time I doubled the recipe and added clams and shrimp and it turned out horrible (I blame my changes) the third time I went back to basics and used cod and halibut and again it was passable but a little bland (I believe the best result I got the first time was due to using rainbow trout).

Nice chowder with plenty of seafood flavor. Served with toasted french bread which went great with it. Also added some Louisiana hot sauce for a bit of kick.

Had to make on the stove because I ran out of time.  Did not seem to hurt the recipe.  My boys loved it.  I added a lot more tomatoes (since they only come in 28 oz can) so I doubled the other ingredients except for the salt and cream mixture.  Since I added a handful or so of wild rice, it got pretty thick on it's own.  Very hearty, especially with the wild rice.  Served with the cheesy garlic bread (also on this site).  Great cold weather meal.

This was delicious!  I  used a bigger can of whole crushed tomoatoes (1 lb and 12 oz); at first I was worried but the tomatoes were easy to mash up when the stew was finished and the larger chunks of tomato added to the texture of the soup.  I used halibut, and it was delicious but expensive. I will try it with cod next time.  I was surprised the fish held up in the crock pot, and it was still delicious and tender.  I waited to add the herbs until the last hour as well (I've heard long cooking can make herbs lose their flavor).  I would definitely add the cream/butter/flour combo at the end. I used heavy cream, and it was a small price to pay for such a thick and delicious soup.

This was great!  I made some changes because of ingredients on hand, I used fresh cubed salmon, taking care about bones.  To cut calories, I omitted the cream at the end.  It was delicious, worth the effort.
