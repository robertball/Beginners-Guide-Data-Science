You don't need the seasoned skewers for this recipe to work.  Maybe they add some flavor, but we had plenty without them.  I soaked plain skewers in wine and sprinkled curry powder on top just for fun.  I used a bag of Coleson's Catch frozen scallops and ended up with about 8 skewers of food between the scallops, mango and onions.  You could leave off the onions though, because they cook much much faster than the scallops and even burn.  I didn't mind that crispiness, but if you'd rather leave them off the skewers and use them as a garnish after it's all cooked that would work as well.  I also sprinkled the scallops with curry powder. I didn't have lime juice, so I just used 2 parts sweet thai chile sauce to 1 part reduced sodium soy sauce and tripled the recipe given to make lots of dipping sauce.  It was and incredible dinner and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Seasoned skewers are amazing! I couldn't imagine what or how they would flavor the scallops and mango until I tried them. They were better than a marinade. The flavor they imparted was deep and subtle at the same time. My advice is to make sure that your grill is pre-heated, and to oil the grill rack instead of the kabobs (or in addition to the kabobs). I had some trouble with sticking, but I fault my technique for that. Oh, and one more thing:  The seasoned skewers come in packs of 10. Since this recipe only calls for 4 skewers I opened the package just enough to slide out the 4, then I wrapped the open package in plastic wrap. I don't know if the skewers lose flavor when exposed to the air, but don't want to take any chances.

These were just terrific.  I marinated the scallops in mango juice (used already cut mangos in juice in a jar from the produce isle), soy sauce and ginger.  The mango is wonderful on the grill, everyone raved.  A nice light summer grill recipe.  I did not use the flavored skewers, just didn't have time to find them.

Excellent recipe.  The skewers really add to the flavor so I recommend going out of your way to find them.  I live in Los Angeles and went to the Bristol Farms in Manhattan Beach for the skewers.  The sauce also adds to the flavor.  This is a recipe that I will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a dinner party.  The main change I made was also to skewer some large shrimp.  It was awesome.  The flavor permeats the seafood. I did mix up a bit of mango chutney with lime juice as a side sauce

This was a delicious recipe.  I used Honey Bourbon skewers and substituted shallots (slightly sauteed) for the green onions.  My family loved it and have asked for me to make it again.

This recipe was so good! The flavors in it were just amazing! I couldn't find curry mango skewers anywhere. But did find ginger mango. They were awesome! Like others said, the flavors just permiate the food. I'll never use regular skewers again! I also never had Mango before and or tried to cook with it. It was great. I would suggest using extra onions though. I used what was called for and there just wasn't enough and had to use some greens to fill. It was a great recipe and something you just have to try!!!

This was so yummy. Somehow the mango flavor is a nice contrast to the scallops and grilling them brings out the flavor.

LOVED these. Had an seafood and beer patio party and these scallop skewers were gone so fast! I couldn't get my hands on the 'seasoned skewers' so opted to use a curry butter instead (from Grilled Mussels with Curry Butter recipe listed on this site). Brushed the butter on in the last minute or so of grilling...will definitely be doing these again!
