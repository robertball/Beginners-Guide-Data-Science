I followed the recipe exactly except to put the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours before I needed to make them. I cooked them on the stove top in a cast iron skillet. Quick and easy side great served with raita. I would make again with less mint (the flavor was a bit too strong for me) or different herbs/spices. I rolled them very thin but might try to make them thicker next time.
