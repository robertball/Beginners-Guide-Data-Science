DO NOT make this recipe as shown - it is bland, full of calories and not colorful at all.

I cut the cheese and ranch dressing in half and omitted the bacon bits (also cubing the cheese instead of shredding it.)  I halfed cherry tomatoes, diced red onions instead of yellow onions, quartered cucumber slices, diced some fresh garlic and added it to the pasta along with a couple extra shakes of black pepper.  This variation made the pasta colorful as well as "as healthy as" pasta and cheese covered with ranch dressing can be.  

The result with the veggie modifications was excellent and I would definitely make it again.

This is delicious, I get requests to make this all the time.  It tastes much better if you make it the night before and let it set over night.

I love this stuff!  I will make it again and probably quite frequently as it's a nice change of pace for lunches.

Added:
broccoli
red onion
diced ham
cheese crumbles

Omitted:
shredded cheese
green olives

Will omit or use depending on purpose of salad:
bacon bits


I made this recipe Sunday evening and it sat in the fridge overnight and into the day before it was eaten.  I'd recommend that.  I'd use just the ham in the future for a weekday salad because by the next day, the bacon bits were no longer crunchy.  However, if serving fresh, those bacon bits are a nice little crunch.  I used only about half a bottle of ranch.  When taste testing, it seemed like a lot and to keep calories down, we stopped at half.  However, the next day, the pasta had completley absorbed the dressing.  That was interesting but overall, the flavor was fantastic and I'd do the same again next time I make this.

Everyone in my office wanted this particular pasta salad, so be prepared if you are taking it to work.  It was fantastic and all the colors were very appealing.

For my family this was just way too much cheese. If I make it again I will cut the cheese in half.

This makes a ton!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it made enough to bring a batch to each side of the family.  My husband and I loved it, as did his family.  My family didn't seem to enthused, but it is their loss! I used rainbow rotini to give it some color and I only put about 12 oz. of cheese instead of 16 oz.  I made it the night before and it was great the next day! All together a great and easy recipe!

I really enjoy this pasta salad...it's so easy and makes quite a bit.  Great for a picnics and barbeques.  What I did do is adjust some of the amounts and use an envelope of ranch dressing instead of a bottle and a jar of "real" bacon pieces instead of bacon bits.

I've made this 2 times and both ways were delicious. 1st time was exactly as recipe stated. 2nd time I substituted diced ham for the bacon, fresh chopped chives for the green onion and 4 cheese Mexican shredded for the cheeses.

I made this for a potluck and about 90% of the people did not like it at all. I really liked it and would make it again just for myself.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This may be one of those recipes that people either love or hate, with no middle ground.  You'll never know unless you try, though!

i doubled the black olives because i dont like green olives. i used crackerbarrel cheese because i couldnt find monteray jack cheese. in my opinion, there is way too much dressing on this. it was pretty much swimming in it. i would recommend halving the dressing quantity.

Neither I, or my husband care for pasta salad. I was recently asked, however, to make a batch for a party. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try but with some changes. I used shell pasta and because hate bottled ranch dressing, I made it using the packaged using buttermilk and adding a tsp of garlic powder. I cubed the cheese instead of using shredded and added thawed, frozen peas, some slightly cooked, bite sized broccoli and a small, chopped red onion instead of white. I found that about half of the dressing was enough and let is sit for a few hours in the fridge so that the pasta could absorb the dressing and other flavors. It was a hit at the party and my husband and I actually enjoyed several servings ourselves. I will definitely make it again.

Love this recipe, it has replaced our old pasta salad recipe which used Italian Dressing. The only changes I made is I added a full jar of real bacon bits (my family loves its bacon bits), used diced red onion instead of the green onion, and I used the buttermilk ranch dressing. We use rotini pasta.  Tip: Let the pasta cool completely after cooking it before adding the cheese or the cheese will start to melt causing it to get clumpy and difficult to stir. Also, as others have said, make it the night before it's much better when it sits over night.

I make a similar recipe only I use half the cheese (usually one of the shredded Italian cheese blends) half the ranch and instead of olives, I use diced cooked ham.  I also recommend using real bacon pieces instead of bacon bits as bacon bits have a nasty after-taste.

This is a great salad, a nice change from the Italian dressing salad. I always use bow tie pasta! I add peas, tomatoes, broccoli flowers, cucumbers,  chopped red and yellow peppers, along with some fresh garlic. Best prepared the night before! I always start out with a half of a bottle of ranch (use a good brand)and add as needed every few hours until the right consistency! I leave out the bacon and ham. Great base of a recipe!

This salad was fantastic, I made my own Ranch dressing, the Hidden Valley Buttermilk dressing mix!  It was VERY good!  I cut the green olives to half, and the salad is salty enough on its own.  No need to add any!  Great potluck salad!

Yum. I didn't use a whole bottle of Ranch, but used about a cup with some mayo mixed in to cut the Ranch flavor a little bit. I also added a ton of fresh veggies (cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion). I hate green olives so I only used the black, and used about 3/4 of a block of medium cheddar. Very very good for lunch or a side dish at dinner.

Boy this makes alot.  I made it exactly as stated but forgot to add the bacon bits, oh man.  But it was still very good for a salad to take to a barbeque.  I used a packet of ranch dressing the type you mix with milk and mayo.  I did that and added some sourcream in place of some of the Mayo.  I will make again.

The best pasta salad! I left the ranch dressing on the side because this salad also goes great with Italian dressing, so I let my family pick which dressing they wanted to add. Both ways are excellent!!

I've made this recipe a few times for BBQ's.  I do not add olives because my family (not me) does not care for them.  I use a refrigerated ranch found in the produce isle and do not use anywhere near 16 oz.  I use half the cheese and dice it rather than shred. I also cook a few slices of bacon and chop them rather than using bacon bits.

I wanted to make this a little healthier and lower in carbs. I used half elbow macaroni and half steamed cauliflower. I used my own Little-To-No-Guilt Ranch Dip, cut the cheese down to 4 oz. (half of both) and only used half of a small can of black olives. I ended up throwing in two chopped roma tomatoes that were going south. Very good. I know I changed it a bit, but these days we need to cook as healthy as we can.

This was a amazing dish very filling instead of bacon bits I cooked bacon and chopped it up I also used colored pasta to give my eyes a feast as well as for my appitite.

I wanted this to be wonderful, but it really wasn't .  With the Monterey, the black olives, and the bacon, how could it go wrong?  I think maybe an envelope of Ranch dressing instead of the bottled Ranch might improve it.   I did use real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Still, I doubt making it again.

I liked this!!! However, i made some of it the night before & added only one handful of each cheese the next day & it did NOT clump. I also used real bacon and added the olives the next day. IT was yummy!!

My usual pasta salad is made with italian dressing, so I decided to try something different with this recipe and everyone at the BBQ really liked it.  I left out the green olives, and didnt have any green onions so I just threw in some chopped onion.

This was the quickest, yummiest recipe ever! I used pasta shells instead of bowtie, omitted the green olives and did NOT double the black olives...there seemed to be enough with just one can. This is good with a lot of bacon bits!

Wow....6 out of 8 thumbs up!! I figured my daughter wouldn''t like it and I was right (she's the very picky one) but the rest of us tore this one up!!  The only change I made was to buy one package with a mixture of Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese instead of two seperate packages....seemed like a lot of cheese.  Very good!!  And guys....it's easy to make!  I made this for the wife and kids and scored major brownie points!!  Enjoy!

I thought this salad was just ok, but my boyfriend loved it.  It's definitely something different, and I will probably make it again.  I added some chopped tomato, and I had to add a little more dressing just before I served it, since it did get a little dry.

I made this with rotini and it really soaked up the dressing so it was a bit dry..I think that next time I will try it with macaroni and even try adding a little shredded crab meat... It did have a really good flavor..Im going to make it again for our barbeques this summer..K F (Brampton,On Canada)

If I were to do this again (which I won't), I would put 1/2 the olives, 1/2 the ranch, and slowly put in the cheese to avoid clumping. This recipe had an OK taste, poor presentation, and VERY easy to make. But over all, this is a recipe I will never make again.

This was delicious. I cut this in half for our family size. I didn't have any black olives and I just wasn't sure how my family would react if I added sliced stuffed green olives, so I left the green ones out too. I used Hidden Valley dressing/seasoning powder mix, mayo, and 2% milk to make the dressing and it came out great! 4.5 stars

I made this with farfalle, and bacon that I microwaved til crisp and then crumbled. I added the grated cheese a little at a time to avoid it clumping up. My only complaint about this pasta salad was that it was very salty, but I'm certain that it was the brand of green olives I used; I would omit them next time, and just use black. Thanks.

We really enjoyed this pasta salad! (Of course, we are "Ranch dressing" fanatics...)
The only ingredient I didn't have was bacon for bacon bits, but I added in some sliced grilled chicken breast and it made a nice, simple summer dinner for us. I will definitely make this again, but will be sure to use REAL bacon bits, especially if serving as a side dish or for a crowd. Thanks for such a simple yet great recipe!

This is a tasty recipe, however I did make a few changes.  I used real bacon, about 6 slices crumbled, and I used block cheddar and co-jack and cubed it, the shredded is too clumpy.  Otherwise great recipe!  Thanks

I have had good luck with using sour cream in cold pasta salads before.  So I used sour cream mixed with a dry ranch dressing package which worked nice.  I also added some finely chopped red pepper.

I also made some changes.  We don't like olives so I left those out.  We use precooked bacon instead of the bacon bits.  Also next time we are going to add frozen peas and carrots( I didn't have any this time)  Thats whats nice about this recipe, you can mix and match!!  Great recipe, my family loved it!!!!!!

This made a ton and almost all of it went in the garbage.  Even my daughter who loves ranch couldn't stand it.  The green olives with pimentos gave it a strange taste and way too much cheese and I am a cheese fanatic.  Normally I don't review stuff but this one rates "A don't waste your time and effort".

This recipe was AMAZING!! I have made it twice and my boyfriend loves it too! I decided to add a few things though on the second go-around: hot sauce to the ranch dressing, brocolli, canned sliced mushrooms, diced red onion and garlic powder--UNBELIEVABLE!!!

It was a little bland for my taste. The next day was worse.  Found Shredded Cheddar with chipotle pepper and used Peppercorn ranch dressing.  Much better.

This is pretty good.  I didn't relize I used fat free dressing until it was to late. I did add some ff.  But it was still good. I used one pkg colby/cheddar cheese crubles and real bacon bits.  I will probably cut down on the olives next time and maybe add something else, but overrall very good.

Really good, I didn't have any green olives, and after adding one package of shredded cheese, decided not to ask the second. I used the fancy thin shredded cheese and it kind of got clumpy. I also used an entire package of real bacon packages. Family loved.

This was really good, and so simple to throw together.  I used low-fat ranch dressing and one package of cheddar/jack cheese instead of two.  I also used one whole jar of bacon bits.  Will make this one again.

Really good salad.  My husband bought fat free Ranch dressing so it probably would have been better with regular Ranch dressing.  I also just used the one package of cheddar/jack cheese instead of two and it was plenty.  Will definately make again.

I made this for my daughter's park picnic b-day party and it was a big hit!  I also added some grape tomatoes and used real bacon bits.  It was wonderful and everyone raved about it.  I will definitely make this again.
