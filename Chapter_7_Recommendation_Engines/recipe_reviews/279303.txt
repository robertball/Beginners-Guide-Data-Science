5.2.20 Made this in my Instant Pot® using the Slow Cook feature.  The recipe doesn’t tell you whether or not to drain the beans, so I didn’t. Really, the only liquid ingredient in the recipe is the ketchup, and it’s only a cup, so I knew it needed some more liquid. But I ended up with w-a-a-a-y too much liquid, the pot looked like soup.  Before I even added the ketchup, I ladled off a lot of the excess liquid from the five cans of beans.  I’d recommend that when you’re adding the beans, drain them, set aside the liquid, and then add it until you reach your desired consistency.  This is very similar to many recipes I’ve made for Calico Beans, but they’re typically baked.  I didn’t add the liquid smoke because we don’t care for it, I did add some salt and pepper, but this was just too sweet for us.  If I make this again, I’d cut the brown sugar in half, but that just could be personal taste.  This was pretty tasty, and I do like that it’s one of those meals you can make early afternoon and not have to fuss with it when it’s time for dinner.  Angela, thanks for sharing your recipe.
