Fabulous vinaigrette! Easy to make, yet tastes better than anything you'd get in a bottle. I love it when a few simple ingredients you have around the house come together to create something so good. I used rice wine vinegar vs. white vinegar because it's milder and sweeter. I also used low sugar seedless raspberry jam and upped that a bit 'til I got the consistency and taste I wanted. Poppyseeds would be a great addition, but this was fine as is and was perfect over mixed salad greens with thin sliced red onion, Granny Smith apple, toasted walnuts, dried cranberries and a bit of feta cheese sprinkled over top - YUM!

I cut this recipe in half to try it.  I used seedless/sugar free raspberry preserves and no salt.  This had the right amount of tangy-ness.  Went great with my grilled chicken salad.  Now I'm making another batch for lunch tomorrow.  It does start to separate so really mix well before serving.

I reduced the amount of ingredients to make a 1/4 cup of the dressing. Made as is, I would rate this recipe with 1-star, as I felt the  vinaigrette had too much vinegar and oil in it, plus I thought it needed a bit sugar, salt and pepper, and a tad bit more of jam. With the modifications I made, I would rate this vinaigrette dressing with 5 stars.

Excellent vinaigrette recipe! I did change it a bit by using white balsamic vinegar and adding 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard to emulsify the dressing. I used it for a pear, gorgonzola, cranberry and candied walnut salad. The combo was delicious. Brought it to my daughter's kindergarten graduation pot luck and it was gone quickly. Very easy to make, which is the best part.

Ow...way to tart for my tastes as written.  I should have used half the amount of vinegar.  I didn't taste until it was all mixed so I doubled the jam and added a teaspoon of sugar, too.  I will be using it tomorrow so will see what happens to the flavor as it stands.  

Fortunately, the ingredients and mixture is incredibly easy so if I doctored it too much, I can always make more!

8.13.16 ~ Made this delicious salad dressing as part of a salad bar for a birthday dinner with friends. Of course, when I asked the other couples what their favorite dressing was, all four of them had a different 'favorite'. No problem, I just made everyone's favorite. This raspberry dressing was very easy to make with 4 simple ingredients. I put the jam, vinegar and olive oil in my Magic BulletÂ® and let it whip together this dressing. I stirred in the salt and pepper to taste.  It has a slightly tart taste and a thickness to the dressing. Our friend who requested this type of dressing and my husband really enjoyed it

It is probably not fair to rate this recipe because I did not make it as is. The recipe provided a baseline (which is all I was really looking for) to create my own dressing with ingredients that I had.  So, I used raspberry (pancake) syrup, I used half white vinegar and half balsamic and the olive oil. I added a big pinch of crushed oregano, a teaspoon of German mustard and finally, about a teaspoon and a half of honey. It was  very delicious.

Good basic formula, doesn't go wrong.  I prefer the stronger flavor of apple-cider vinegar instead of basic white, although it's more expensive.

I use more raspberry (preserves) than this recipe calls for -- about three times as much.  I'm looking for real raspberry flavor, and less doesn't seem to do it.

I liked this recipe as it was very easy. I did add 1 tsp. Dijon mustard because it was a bit sweet, and without a distinct taste.

Yes. I made changes and will make it again and again indefinitely. I changed it a lot because it needs a lot of help. But I give five stars because I rave how simple and inexpensive it is to make. Firstly, I found that it needs much more raspberry jam than the meager amount the recipe calls for, and also it needs typical vinaigrette spices, as I put in ground mustard and a bit of jarred chopped garlic and a bit of dried thyme. The mustard is integral to the flavor that's fantastic! It's better than Ken's Raspberry Walnut! And much healthier for you! I'm a triple the ingredients up to fill up the whole Ken's plastic jar, that I emptied the contents of to have a bottle I can shake it in.

A very simple salad dressing to make.  If you already make raspberry jam it's even easier!  It is not sweet like you would think, but a tad bit tart, which is fine with me.  If you like tart and you like raspberry it's a good dressing to try.
