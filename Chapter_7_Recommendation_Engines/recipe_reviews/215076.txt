Absolutely delicious!  I substituted a number of things:  shrimp for the chicken because I needed to use it up, broccoli for the zucchini, added 1 more tomato because they were on the small side, and mozzarella for the feta.  I also didn't use the second 2 tablespoons of olive oil.   And I used 2 garlic cloves minced.  It only took me 45 minutes to get it on the table after receiving this recipe in my e-mail wondering what to cook for dinner.  It was a lifesaver.  My husband said it was as good as going out for a nice dinner.  A very versatile recipe.

Great taste! The feta melts slightly and blends in with the veggies. Don't add too much extra salt, I added just a bit and was surprised by how much extra flavor the feta gives the dish. I also cut down on the amount of chicken; the quinoa gives protein, so it is a very filling dish.

This was a good dish. The only changes I made were to reduce the cooking times (I like my veggies underdone and I cut my chicken pretty small), used cloves of garlic (all I had) and cooked the quinoa in water instead of broth (personal taste preference). I also threw in some cut up broccoli just because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. I felt that it was a great addition to this dish and will probably add it when I cook it again.

Really, really good! As a Gluten Free family, finding new recipies that I don't have to convert is difficult.  This one fits the bill! The flavors are amazing and prep is easy. Next time I make it, I think I'll add more veggies and no meat. With the quinoa, meat just isn't needed.

Very tasty - I added zero salt, the feta and chicken broth add plenty of flavor. I used boneless pork loin instead of chicken because I needed to use it, and it works very well.

WE COULDN'T FIND QUINOA, SO WE USED BROWN RICE, USED FRESH GARLIC, ADDED MUSHROOMS AND CUT THE CHICKEN INTO BITE SIZED PEICES. AMAZING DISH. THE SMELL IN MY KITCHEN MADE MY MOUTH WATER. I THINK BASIL AND FETA WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written except the garlic scapes. They were not available in my area, so I used scallions and garlic instead. My husband loved this dish. Thanks for a "keeper!"

I was a bit worried that it would be dry as there didn't seem to be any "saucy" ingredients, and since I was going to have to use canned diced tomato's, I didn't drain all of the juice off. This was delicious and I'm excited to try it with fresh tomato! Cooked again and again, the fresh lime juice and feta are essential! Any combo of veggies would work and I added some Oregano and smoked Paprika when cooking the chicken.

This was wonderful!  It was my first time trying quinoa, and it's much better than couscous, which I thought it looked like.  I couldn't find scapes, so I substituted chopped garlic, and it got good reviews from the family.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more vegetables!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Loved it! But I did make a couple of changes.   I added no salt, because it doesn't need it.   I like to saut√© the quinoa a bit before I cook it like the recipe.  It gives the quinoa a toasty nutty flavor that is wonderful.

This wasn't the worst dish, but definitely bland and just plain odd compared to other quinoa recipes.  I felt like the flavors didn't mesh well, especially the lime juice with the zuccini and feta.  My taste buds were confused. I'm going back to my usual go-to quinoa recipe and trying that with chicken.

Amazing!  Instead of zucchini, I added mushrooms, pine nuts, and spinach, and it even tasted great reheated.

My first time making quinoa... this was delish! I don't care for zucchini though so I used broccoli instead. I kept everything exactly the same. My bf doesn't like feta but he ate this up and had seconds! It is really yummy. Just wing it on the cooking times... nothing worse than overcooked veggies. I think next time I will use less oil, 4T is alot.

Wow! So amazingly delicious! I did do a bunch of things different, but I basically stuck to the recipe. I didn't have Garlic Scapes, just replaced with Minced Garlic, I added mushrooms, red and green peppers, and two freshly grated carrots. I didn't have any zucchini*I don't care for it anyways*.. I did season the chicken with Pepper, Garlic Powder and Onion Powder. Also I added pepper to the vegetables. Again, didn't stray too far, just extra seasoningsand colorful vegetables! Super super recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was a hit at dinnertime! I had to sub a few items. I didn't have fresh basil or lime juice. I used a pesto sauce to cook the chicken breasts (used thin sliced) in a saute pan. I used lemon juice at the end. Sliced veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms) lengthwise and not in chunks for easier cooking and eye appeal. 
I did not have garlic scapes, but used chopped garlic in with the pesto. (basil and olive oil). This was a great hit at my house, even my 4 year old gobbled it up and it was a great 1st quinoa recipe for us. Definitely making again!

We thought this was delicious...can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I usually try to follow a recipe pretty closely the first time I try something but I did make a few changes.  Firstly, I always toast my quinoa slightly and then rinse before cooking.  I had no idea what garlic scapes were so just used some minced garlic.  I used only about a quarter of onion and no tomatoes due to family preference and increased the zucchini and basil.  I also used a rotisserie chicken because I was so short on time and then tossed in some toasted pine nuts.  This is a great base recipe and could be modified in so many ways to suit your tastes.

Really flavorful and easy.  This is a good recipe for using up what you have in the refrig. I would say that the essential ingredients are the basil, feta and quinoa.  You can add what ever vegetables you like; sun dried tomatoes would be good if you don't have fresh.  I added some wine from my glass when the veg and chicken mixture seemed a bit dry.  Used one can of broth to cook the quinoa and it was perfect at 12 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

I have never reviewed a recipe before, though there have been many standouts over the years from this and other sites. But I just had to create an account and comment on this one -- it ROCKED! The whole family has been licking their plates clean. 

I made some changes, but the basic flavor comes from the feta, acid (I used lemon) and basil -- all added at the end. I doubled the zucchini, used chicken thighs instead of breasts (probably used five thighs), used three tomatoes, threw in two ears of corn cut off the cob, and used 8 oz feta, and a bunch of basil. The lemon and feta at the end made the whole dish sing. I put it over whole wheat couscous because that's what I had in the house. 

We can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow. This is a keeper!

Great recipe! Total cook time is much less than stated if you work efficiently: heat the skillet/olive oil for chicken. Start the quinoa & chick broth. Put the chicken on for cooking. Cut the veggies in parallel. Pull out the chicken & start the veggies. Chop the chicken & add to veggies.

Tip: sprinkle the feta on the dish once you've served it to prevent it from melting.

Total cook time: 30-35 mins. Much faster than stated.

I made this using shrimp instead of chicken, but simply because I wanted to add seafood to our weekly menu.  I made very little changes to this recipe.  I added yellow summer squash along with the zucchini.  Next time I may add mushrooms or even broccoli too.  I used green onions instead of garlic scapes and added 2 T. minced garlic.  While zucchini and yellow squash were cooking, I added fresh ground pepper and a pinch of sea salt.  Squeezed a half of lime for its juice towards the end as I added fresh basil and tossed with Feta cheese.  This recipe was fresh tasting and filing.... plus ultra healthy.  I generally use all organic ingredients, but that is a personal choice.  Will make this again soon!

I really enjoyed this recipe; it was a nice combination of flavors that I love, combined in a way I'd never thought of. It's a good replacement for a pasta-based dish. Even my 4 & 10 yo enjoyed it! Next time I will double the recipe.

Yum. Made as directed with the exception of garlic scapes, which no one in my area markets ever hear of. Used garlic instead. Quick, easy, affordable and absolutely delicious. Will serve to company.

My first experience cooking quinoa and a big success.  I am on a restricted diet, so I took a cue from some of the other reviews and changed up the veggies.  I used carrot, mushroom, red bell pepper and broccoli and omitted the tomato, onion and garlic.  It was still delicious!  As with some other reviewers, I will greatly increase the proportion of vegetables in the next batch.  I'm also looking forward to making it with shrimp. Thanks for this very versatile recipe.

This was excellent!  I used minced garlic and added red peppers with the onion mixture.  I also added more garlic, mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes with the zucchini.  I didn't have fresh basil or lime jc so I used dried basil and no jc and it was still excellent.  Next time I would add some salt and pepper while sauteing the veggies.  We get our quinoa in a big bag at Cosco and have been looking for recipes to use it in.  Thank you!  This one is a keeper that I will be making frequently.

I always try to stick with the original recipe first time but I really wanted to make this and didn't have zucchini and had to look up what garlic scape was...not in season.  So, I read a few other reviews and went with 2 garlic cloves and broccoli.  I promise I'll try it in future as is but it turned out fantastic nonetheless.  I would also agree with other reviewers that it comes together in 40 minutes or less if you don't want soggy vegetables.  I'm going to make this recipe many times to add new variations to the vegetables like asparagus, snow peas, leeks, regular peas, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, spinach and maybe a variety of fresh herbs out of my garden.  Thanks Kmo for the basis to endless possibilities for a quick and healthy weeknight meal.

I tried this with Gorgonzola the first time and it was good. A little rich, though.  The second time I used feta as directed, and saut√©ed mushrooms with onion and garlic. It was great! My hubby loves this one!

I really loved this dish! This was my first time eating quinoa, and although it will take some getting used to, it is very good! I am rating 4 stars based on recipe as made. But for future times I make this, I think I'll add some bell peppers and more more more feta and lime! Absolutely delicious and filling!!

I couldn't find garlic scapes so I used minced garlic and instead of zucchini, tomato I used a stir fry blend along with rest of the ingredients and it tasted great. I have saved this recipe for future use. Thank you!

I rarely give any recipe 5 stars but this one really deserves it.   It was so full of flavor and really tasty.  I make it exactly like the recipe said except I didn't have a fresh tomato so used about 1/3 cup drained diced canned tomatoes.   Thank you for sharing it with us.

This recipe was the first time I tried quinoa or cooking with feta cheese. I didn't have garlic scapes so I just used a couple cloves of minced garlic. Very tasty! I didn't like the texture of the quinoa but the taste was good. The chicken and veggie mixture also tastes amazing with mashed potatoes. I imagine rice or pasta would also make great sides. I will definitely make this again.

Garlic scapes are not locally available.  Used crushed garlic instead.  Very tasty dish, but not very appealing visually.  Definitely will try again, using larger crumbles of feta.

I rarely find a quinoa dish that I don't like - this was no exception!!  It was bursting with flavour...I did skip adding in the chicken, only because we were already having our chicken on the side (it was already seasoned and ready when I found this recipe).  This would absolutely be a fantastic one dish meal!  The basil and feta really give this amazing flavour - cannot wait to have leftovers!!!

SUPER YUMMY!!!  I never had Quinoa before and I love the nuttiness!  I always just utilize whatever veggies I have in the refridge.  This is pretty much the only dish with LOADS of veggies that my 2 and 3 yr old boys devour!!

Decent basic recipe, but it really needed more seasoning. Garlic scapes are really mild and frankly, I would prefer more basil. I recommend that you make the quinoa more like a pilaf by adding some chopped veggies. Then I would zip up the chicken with some minced garlic and perhaps use a stronger cheese: gorgonzola, for instance.

Really tasty! This is a great quinoa recipe.  My husband doesn't like feta cheese and he even liked it.  I made a few modifications to the recipe:
- I used 2 minced garlic cloves instead of garlic scapes
- I added a chopped red bell pepper along with the tomatoes and zucchini
- I didn't add any salt.  The recipe was fine without it.

I swapped out the veggies for broccoli and zucchini and omitted the tomatoes, but added in a small amount of tomato sauce. This had a very Mediterranean flavor. I liked it.

Quick and Tasty!  The entire meal can be made in about 30 minutes.  I use sun dried tomatoes when I make it; I love the extra flavor it adds.  My other tip is to add the feta when you plate up to keep it from melting too much.

This was yummy and an easy meal.  We added eggplant to ours.  I might use canned tomatoes next time or more as they were not very prevalent in my dish.  I will make again, my husband and 2 year old both ate it up!

I just thought this recipe was ok.  The only sub. I made was broccoli for the zucchini.  I liked the quinoa though, and must try it again with other protein.  Just using chicken broth vs plain water makes so much difference.

This was delicous. Great flavor, and different than our usual chicken stir fries. We did add one red bell pepper. Also, instead of a normal tomato, we used a handful of grape tomatoes cut in half. For the feta, we used reduced fat. Excellent recipe.

Yummy! I left out the onion (b/c my husband doesn't like them), I didn't have fresh basil so I used a ton of dried and I just used a rotisserie chicken since I didn't want it mixed in. It was SO good! Even my 2 1/2 yr old liked it... but she likes almost anything. :)

This is the best chicken/quinoa combination I've made so far.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried, but can't wait to try it with the fresh stuff.  The lime gave a nice kick and the feta tasted great with this.  Definitely a recipe I'd make again.  I used homemade chicken broth for the quinoa, which made it taste even more special!

Tons of flavour! Only changes I made; used cloves of garlic instaed of scapes, and mushrooms & grated carrots instead of zuchinni.  Turned out great! Will make again, and try some different veggies, I'm sure anything would work.

Amazing, just amazing.  My first try at quinoa and even my boys (5,3,1 & hubby) loved it.  I thought for sure I would have to bribe them, but they just loved it (and me!).  I am making it again tonight, but will make a few changes.  First of all, I added chopped baby bella mushrooms and I can't imagine this dish without those.  Incredible.  But this time I am adding asparagus & yellow pepper to the mix.  Instead of a traditional tomato, I halved some cherry tomatoes.  So much flavor! I doubled the quinoa for my crew and will again.  I also use more than 4 oz of the feta cheese--almost 8 oz for all the extra veggies I add.  Instead of cooking the chicken with the veggies, I cooked it ahead of time by just putting a bit of evoo on it and then some garlic salt.  Turned out fantastic.  But this time I am going to use a rotisserie chicken and just add the meat in with the veggies like last time.  I need to cut out time from this recipe wherever i can because it does take a while with lots of chopping.  But it's so worth it!  Not sure the lime made a huge difference, but will add it anyway just 'cuz I have it.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Made this for dinner on Tuesday night for my family, and everyone enjoyed it, including my 2-year old.  I made it exactly as described, and we thought it was tasty, simple, and refreshing.  Quinoa tastes very good cooked in chicken broth, but the liquid created from cooking the tomatoes and melting the feta really adds something special to the dish.  The veggie prep does task some time, so for a weeknight, I'd try to prep the veggies the night before to save time, but I will definitely be making it again.  

As far as variations go, I'd like to try it with a light fish next time around.

Love this recipe! I only used water for the quinoa in the rice cooker and it still came out fantastic. Thanks for the recipe. I am hooked :)

This was an extremely easy dish to prepare.  I thought it lacked just a tad in flavor.  I added more garlic and onion.  Overall it was tasty and easy to prepare while being kind to the pocketbook.  Thanks for sharing.

Was a simple dish to make, but as I was cooking this, I was thinking that there were not really many spices in it.  Sure enough, my entire family thought this was a very bland dish.  The zucchini was  very tasty though.  I could not find quinoa at my store so I used brown rice.  Not sure if that would have made it better or not.  I did however seasoned the zucchini and tomatoes with garlic powder and pepper while they cooked.  I didn't want to change the recipe too much as I wanted to taste the original recipe.  But my family wouldn't want me to make it again.  Nice to try something new for dinner, but we didn't like this one much.

This recipe is delicious and has become a staple in our household. I actually buy the 90 second microwaveable quinoa and that works great. I add more veggies just so we have enough leftovers. I usually do 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash and about 4 tomatoes.  This dish is healthy and so fresh tasting. Highly recommend!!!

This was so delish!  If you're looking for a healthy dinner and need to use up some chicken (or shrimp) and veggies, look no further.  This is also a great make-ahead meal.  I boxed up the leftovers for later in the week, and they tasted as good as day 1.  Based on the ingredients I had on hand, I made the following substitutions:  red onion for the regular onion,  lemon juice for the lime juice, dried basil for fresh, and grape tomatoes for the regular tomato.  I used the fat free, lower sodium broth, but the feta made up for the lower salt, so this had fantastic flavor.  For veggies, I used the zucchini, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, red pepper, and snap peas.  The combination of veggies made it pretty interesting, not to mention healthy.  This one's a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I too did a lot of substitutions. I used baby spinach (about half bag) in place of the scapes. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Omitted the onion, doubled the zucchini, and used around 1/2 t dried basil instead of fresh.

This was the first time I've made quinoa and I LOVE it.  The chicken and veggies were also super easy to make.  I don't think it took me the 55 minutes as the recipe stated.  Well be making this again and eating more quinoa!

I made this dish last night exactly as directed except I added a couple more leaves of basil and I used garlic instead of garlic scapes.  Delicious!  This is a definite keeper in our meal plans.

I didn't have basil, feta, or lime, so I used thyme, oregano,  and a little lemon. It turned out great! I followed the recipe for everything else.  It was a great base recipe and easy to change!

Made this last night, pretty much as written. The combination of flavors was a winner. When I prepare it the next time, I will consider keeping the tomatoes out until I put the chicken back in so they don't cook down as much. I agree that this is a great base to experiment from with different veggies and other meat combinations. The quinoa can easily be switched out for rice or noodles.

This is quite good!  I added a can of diced tomato because there just isn't enough tomato if you only use 1.  This also made more of a "sauce".  I diced my chicken as well, and used 2 cloves of minced garlic.  You if you use the diced tomato, you can probably use more basil as well.  Very nice, healthy recipe!

I've made this multiple times now and it just keeps getting better.  I've used zucchini, radishes, artichoke hearts, asparagus, carrots, cabbage, spinach, swiss chard, you name it and everything works.  You can really put your own twist on it.

I browned the Quinoa in butter prior to adding chicken stock.  I used two zucchini and two tomatoes and this turned out FANTASTIC.  Will definitely cook it again.

A new favorite! The veggies, coated lightly with cheese and just a zip of lime made this an instant hit with even my suspicious teens. Easy tips: buy chicken strips, use any garlic you have on hand, know that quinoa never cooks in 12 minutes- more like 25 and water works if you don't have broth. Thanks for great recipe!

While visiting my mom, I decided to introduce her to quinoa. The day after I bought it, this recipe showed up in my inbox. We had almost everything needed.

Changes I made: added one large chopped portabella mushroom just before cooking the chicken, replaced the garlic scapes with chopped garlic, only had blue cheese on hand, and added a tiny bit of salt, pepper, and powdered chicken bullion to the mix to give a little more flavor.

I've cooked plenty of times for my mom who is a tough critic. I'm not sure she's ever complimented me on anything as much as she did w this dish! Def a new favorite!

HOLY COW, was this delicious!  I've never written a review here before, but I just had to for this recipe.  I think my boyfriend and I commented two or three times each about how surprisingly delicious this was!  I thought it would need more seasoning, but the vegetables and basil (I used an entire plant) really do provide enough flavor.  I cooked it as written, except I added eggplant (delicious!) and tripled the recipe. I also added the feta to the individual servings rather than cooking it in the pan, as other reviewers suggested; that was a good decision.  All around, this was a really delicious recipe that I'll be putting into heavy rotation!

Love this recipe. I added mushrooms as well, and we used goat cheese instead of feta. It was a fantastic change! We sprinkled it on top a few minutes before serving so it was just a hint melted. Delicious.

This dish is surprisingly delicious.  As I was preparing it I didn't expect much.  But once it was finished it was awesome.  I pretty much followed the recipe as shown but next time will add more veggies.  The Quinoa is perfect with this.  Much better tasting than brown rice.

I didn't have feta so used fresh Parma reggiano. Used yellow squash instead of zucchini. Really good but I should have deseeded the tomatoes. Also I only had a lemon but would have preferred lime.
Didn't need a side dish for this. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch!

Very simple and tasty!  The only substitution I made was I used whole wheat couscous instead of quinoa because that's what I had in the house.  Also my cooking times were much less but it's probably because I diced small and made small strips of chicken.  Very good, will make again.

I am really new to the world of Quinoa, and am pretty sold on it.  It is great to have a tasty and health conscious protein option that haven't used before.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The one difference I did was to use less low-sodium chicken broth (1 1/2 cup) and cooker longer at a lower temperature.  It seems to give the Quinoa some additional texture.  I also may try coconut oil next time as an alternative to olive oil.   Enjoy guilt-free.

My family LOVED this...even the little ones!  I followed the recipe exactly except used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta (I am just not a huge fan of feta).  It was delicious!  You can easily substitute other meats, tofu, and any combination of vegetables, and it will still be wonderful!

Great Flavor! At first I was a little bothered by the combination of flavors, but after tasting it I knew this one would become one of our family favorites. I substitute one garlic clove for each scape, grape tomatoes, halved, for the whole one, shrimp for the chicken, and dried basil for the fresh. One day we'll be able to make the recipe as written, and see what it can REALLY be!

This was my first time trying quinoa. I thought the dish was on the plain side, but good. My husband said that it tasted too much like Italian dressing. I don't think I'll make this again.

This was really delicious. I modified a bit according to what I had. I precooked pork meat and it it's buillon coocked quinoa. I used two zuccinis, red and green bell pepper and 3 tomatoes. I basically put everything together and when pepper was ready added the quinoa and a bit of feta cheese. I think lemon juice is very very important and seems to make all the difference. My husband loved it as well. I am sure it will be  even better with chicken. Thank you for this recipe.

Made this for company last night and it was perfect.  You can do all the prep before they arrive, let it simmer and then serve it.  Even my picky eight year old daughter loved it.

Second Time: Increased stars to 5. This time we made it with brocolli instead of squash and feta cheese and it was incredible!

First Time: Delicious! I realized I didn't have onions or zuchinni so I used mushrooms, squash, and green tomatoes from the garden instead. I also used parmesean cheese and red pepper flakes. The lime juice and mushrooms were amazing!

This is very good and a quick supper. I used the base recipe and added more veggies, including sweet potatoes, frozen peas, red pepper & edamane. It turned out very good and was easy to make. Reheats well. Frozen diced chicken works well if you don't have fresh.

Great! Easy and fun to play with. I added way more veg, basil, and feta, and I added some white wine, artichoke tapenade oh, and a couple of capers. I also used organic red quinoa. Very tasty.

This dish was absolutely wonderful! I am new to quinoa and both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. We eat a lot of chicken and I'm always looking for varied ways of preparing it. Will definitely do this again, and again.

I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  My family didn't like the combination of flavors.  However,  I thought it was great!  They felt the cheese flavor was a little overpowering.  If I make it again, I will use less cheese for them.  I thought it was good.

I liked the flavors in this dish; however my hb found it to be a little strange.   I did find the directions a little ambiguous, which is why it's getting 3 stars. I wasn't sure how finely to chop the chicken or vegetables. As a result I chopped the chicken into small pieces and they ended up overcooked.

This is a GREAT meal to make on sundays and have for the entire week.  I added red peppers and sun dried tomatoes and next time i will add broccoli as well.  I may try to omit the chicken broth and use water instead to try and save unnecessary calories.  The feta cheese adds enough flavor.  I will definately be making this again and experimenting with different veggies!

I don't usually give 5 stars, but this recipe is sooooo easy, fast, and versatile.  This is something we make over and over again and it is always different (depending on what we have on hand), but it is always very tasty.  For a busy family like mine this is definitely a keeper.

This is really good!  I wasn't sure about the feta when I read the recipe, but it really went well with the dish.  I didn't use zucchini - I added green beans instead and also some red pepper.  I have never heard of garlic scrapes, so I just used 2 cloves minced garlic.  I will make this again.

wonderful! you can substitute veggie (I used aubergine instead of zucchini), and quinoa with the cereal you prefer. The feta cheese is the "secret ingredient" that gives a rich and very interesting taste! I will make it again, my father was soo surprising!

Very tasty and easy.  Used fresh Zucch and basil from the garden, added oregano just for personal preference and used chives and minced garlic.  The feta really adds a wonderful depth to the flavor.  I also rinse the quinoa first and toast a bit.  I tossed in a little orzo too just because. :)

I used basil from a tube and garlic, not garlic scapes. Not as fresh but that's what I had available.

This is very good.  There is way more quinoa that I find to be necessary though.  Next time, I will cut that in half and stir it in instead of trying to use it as a base.
I made this a 2nd time, adding eggplant and cutting the amount of quinoa in half.  It was much better.

My husband really likes this meal, but we both add some Cajun (spicy) seasoning at the end to give it a bit more flavor. It‚Äôs a tasty, filling and healthy meal though.

This was a very great tasting, family-friendly meal. I used 4 pieces of chicken instead of two. I also added broccoli and left out the feta cheese. I seasoned it slightly with garlic salt. Very flavorful, and my whole family loved it!

I was surprised this turned out as much flavor as it did! The only change I made was not to cook the mixture for the additional 10 minutes at the end. My chicken had already fully cooked and was still warm, so there was no need. The chicken also turned out really tender. I'll definitely make this again!

I didn't have lime or feta cheese on hand, so I used mozzarella cheese. And I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  Everyone gave it rave reviews!

My whole family (including my 4+6 year old) loved this dish!  I made it because the description said it was flexible and I definitely needed it to be.  I made it with what I had on hand - no garlic scapes (didn't even know what that was until this recipe!) I swapped it for scallions.  Used veggies zucchini, tomatoes, and artichoke.  Didn't have feta cheese so I used parmesan.  Also, would be just as good without the chicken and with veggie broth for a vegetarian meal!  Love how flexible this recipe is for a great meal.

I never would have thought to put lime juice with feta and basil, but it worked! I added broccoli, which was nice. Instead of serving this over quinoa, I mixed the cooked quinoa right in with everything else at the end, and it soaked up all the extra sauce. I also appreciated how healthy it was. It will feed a crowd if you add extra veggies!

My family loved it. I sauteed the onion and garlic together till they were almost translucent. then I added cubed yellow squash. When the squash was almost done I added cut up rotisserie chicken until it was warm. Then at the last I added the tomato and lime juice. I continued cooking on low until tomato was warm then served it over the quinoa. I added the feta cheese to my bowl while the rest of the family added Parmesan cheese to theirs.

This recipe is a keeper!!! I made it according to the recipe, except that I had chicken thighs in the freezer I wanted to use. I also threw in some baby spinach leaves that I wanted to use up. The beauty of this recipe is that you can throw in whatever you need to use up! Hubby went back for seconds. We are already planning to serve this when we have an overnight guest next week. Thank you for this one!!

I threw in about a table spoon and a half of sundries tomatoes and it was delicious! The tomatoes alone were a little bland so I saw the need to add the sundrieds, small change but worth noting! Cook your veggies just how you like them. When you take the chicken out and set them aside, they continue to cook a little because of the heat they've retained. So throw them in after you've got your veggies just how you like them and then for the last 5-7 minutes or so, add chicken. It's already mostly cooked. (I sliced my chicken thin so it would cook faster)

Great dish! I added half red pepper, some celery and 2 garlic cloves. The rest was the same as this was our meal. It's the lime , fresh basil and feta that makes this delightful. It will be a regular in our house now! 
I believe we could skip the chicken and chicken broth and use veggie broth instead to make it an alternative dish. Lots of protein in Quinoa.

Great dish me and my family loved it!!  I did make a few changes. I added okra and leeks with an allspice mixed in instead of tomatoes and zucchini . All other flavors were great. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious.  Great combo of flavors.  I'm sure it would be great with any veggies.  I added a little more tomato (used plum).  Next time, I'll cut the zucchini in a little larger chunks; they were good, but lost in the ingredients.  Only used olive oil to cook the onion (and I used 2 cloves of garlic, chopped) - didn't need to add more when cooking the chicken (which I cut in bite-sized pieces for easy eating).  I made the recipe for 4 servings, but used one chicken breast, which made 3 good-sized servings with the quinoa.  Will definitely make again!

I'm still experimenting with Quinoa. It was a decent dish. It's all about the flavors. I didn't use zucchini (I didn't have it nor do I really like it) - I saw a review that states they used water instead of chicken broth. I personally enjoyed the chicken broth and couldn't imagine how it's taste with water alone. I seasoned my chicken pre hand. I didn't use lime juice either. I used extra onion and two cloves of garlic. The only part that I could've done without is the cheese. I didn't have feta cheese but I saw a review that said they used mozarella. I had fresh mozz. so I used it and place it on top of my saut√©ed chicken. It melted but I could've done without it as it didn't ADD anything to the recipe. Plus fresh mozz produces this juice that slightly filled my pan. Perhaps feta gives a better outcome. I enjoyed my meal. Yay for healthier eating! Thanks for this recipe!

I made this with ground chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, chopped asparagus and red pepper. This is what I had on hand. I was a bit hesitant to add the feta and lime juice, as it was quite tasty without, but it was also really great with it in. We didn't add any additional salt.

My only complaint was that there was no sauce to serve with the quinoa. It might be better to mix the quinoa into the rest of the ingredients instead of serving it over top.

The only change I made was to use dried basil, all I had in the house.   I thought it had a great flavor and made dull chicken fun...

Great tasting and healthy. Easy to make also. I love some good Italian favors so I kicked up the garlic a bit.

Three chicken breasts to serve 3 people and used 1 large garlic clove instead of the scapes due to being out of season. Very good and interesting favors - my 15 year said it was incredible!

Swapped fresh tomato for can of Muir Glen'd Diced Tomatoes with Garlic and Basil.  No garlic scapes - just used diced garlic.  Turned out great - very flavorful.

We really liked this.  It was easy and quick.  Works for me.  I used 2 garlic cloves, but otherwise made according to the recipe.  I like the idea of adding or substituting other vegetables.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for posting.

Pretty surprised at how well this turned out. I didn't remove the chicken before adding the veggies because I'm lazy. I made 4X the recipe so I could eat throughout the week. Still delicious after thawing from the freezer.

I made this per directions, except used a rice cooker instead of a pan, and mozzerella instead of feta because I can't stand feta.  These were my only changes.    Healthy and tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was ... good. It tasted a little bitter to me, but my wife didn't think so. Overall, it didn't meet my expectations. I'll modify the recipe if I make it again. It needs something.

Super yummy!! My 8 year old daughter even ate it and she is a picky one. I used minced garlic instead of scapes because I had it on hand. Didn't alter the flavor in my opinion.

Loved this dish. It's very easily manipulated to fit your fridge contents. I substituted broccoli for zucchini and added spinach at the end. It turned out scrumptious!

This recipe was delicious. I used red quinoa and didn't add the feta cheese (simply because I'm not eating cheese right now) but I'm sure it would be great. So glad I have some left for tomorrow!! Yummy.

This was really good - used regular garlic and it still tasted great.  Next time I might cut down on the feta to save some calories.

Made this last night mainly because i have lots of fresh basil right now.  It was really good, though i did use spinach instead of zucchini and light cream cheese for feta.  My husband is not a veggie eater, and the tomatoes and spinach cook down nicely. I have lime flavored olive oil, so that worked just great, didn't need to go buy a lime!

Definitely cook the quinoa in chicken broth. I added a can of diced tomatoes to it which really added some flavor. Would give this a five star with the addition. I omitted the chicken since it already has the protein from the grain so this is a great recipe for someone who is vegetarian. Just substitute the chicken broth for vegetable. I also omitted the lime juice

It seemed like it may be bland so we added black pepper, but otherwise followed exactly and what a treat! The cheese, basil, and lime at the end really added to the flavor profile. Even our skeptical daughter who is home for the summer loved it!

I have made this several times now, and it's become one of my favorite weeknight dishes.  I don't tend to measure anything but the quinoa/chicken broth ratio, and it always turns out well.  Most recently, I threw in some red pepper and a diced jalapeno in addition to the base recipe.  Even my husband, who doesn't "believe" in healthy recipes, loves this one!  A definite keeper!

This was a really great recipe. We were looking to eat seafood so I took the advice of another member and used shrimp and added mushrooms. I also turned this into a "bowl" by putting some baby spinach leaves into the bottom of each individual wide soup bowl then layering it with the quinoa and then the shrimp and veggies for serving. Delicious AND nutritious.

This is a great dish. The lime, feta, basil, onions, garlic (no scapes and don't know what that is, lol), zucchini , tomatoes, and tender chicken blend together so wonderfully and taste great on the quinoa.  This was DH's first quinoa experience, and even Mr. Steak and Potatoes liked it.  Thank you!

I do not like quinoa, I knew its one the newest food fads but I would prefer brown rice or maybe barley instead. And feta cheese isn't one of my husband's favorites, so I would use some the Italian cheese mix with the basil and veggies.

This is very good and healthy. The only thing I did differently is I used more zucchini about 4 small zucchini. I image broccoli would be good too. I will definitely make this again.

Really enjoyed this. Was my first time cooking with quinoa and found the meal delicious and filling.
I'm vege so substituted the chicken for soya. I also used coconut oil and only 2 spoons in total. Also added an extra tomato and lots of black pepper!

Absolutely delicious.  However, I added along with the fresh zucchini and fresh tomatoes, about 4 tablespoons of oven dried Roma tomatoes in olive oil, plus added oregano.  Loved it!!!

I made the recipe but did not have feta cheese or lime juice. I instead used queso fresco (kroger brand) and instead of the lime juice, I added Trader Joes Island Soyaki. It is very delicious! Thanks!

Mmmmm, loved this recipe! I especially loved the taste of quinoa cooked in chicken broth! I didn't use zucchini so it cut about 8 minutes off of my cook time. Instead of olive oil, I used coconut oil which makes the veggies and chicken just melt in your mouth. I didn't use any garlic either. I used red paper for some kick and chili powder, a pinch of Mrs. dash seasoning (no salt at all) onion, mushrooms, tomatoes, basil and cilantro....saut√©ed it for about five minutes, added the chicken, saut√©ed for another 5-10 minutes until chicken was done and then topped it off with a little goat cheese instead of feta and this dish had amazing flavor and it is better for you than the original dish! Delicious!

This is so good! My husband keeps asking me when I'm going to make it again. I added a lot more vegetables just to get a variety of vitamins. I added carrots, squash, broccoli, and cauliflower. It was delicious!

Made this last night and it was delicious! This was an effort to get my hamburger-and-french fry-loving fiance to eat something healthy and he really liked it! I added more vegetables but used the same amount of feta and lime juice. I will be making this again!

Not a bad start, but I had to add extra seasonings since it was bland as written.  I did use low sodium, low fat broth which may have contributed.  Salt and pepper added to chicken while cooking, then added Tastefully Simple seasoned salt to taste.   Added a little broth with vegetable when cooking.

This was an awesome recipe! I switched up the veggies using asparagus instead of zucchini and I used about a dozen cherry tomatoes. I also threw in celery which added a nice crunchy texture. I cut down on the amount of feta and basil I used. I used the juice of half a lime which was a bit more than 1 tablespoon the recipe called for. Overall I think this recipe was great and seems to be very flexible with ingredients.

I had a day-old rotisserie chicken in the fridge and was looking for a healthy side dish. I used what I had on hand for some substitutions and it turned out to be a great entr√©e! My other modifications: kale instead of zucchini, roma tomato (I'm not a huge tomato fan so the small one was perfect), and garlic cloves. I forgot to add the basil and it was still tasty! I added in the kale and chicken at the same time I put the tomato in. Pretty simple, healthy choice for dinner. I'll definitely be making it again.

This recipe was delicious. I'm just starting to like quinoa and the chicken broth gave it a great flavor. I was afraid the dish would not have a lot of flavor but once the tomatoes cooked down and the feta melted, it was delish.

Wonderful recipe! Simple ingredients and easy to prepare, but great complexity of flavor! The small changes I made were to use lemon instead of lime because that's what I had and it seemed to fit better, take out zucchini because we don't like it, use about a tsp. of dried basil instead of fresh, and not add oil a second time (just 2 Tbsp. total).

Substituted Romano- Parmesan for feta & a tsp of balsamic vinegar for "acid" versus lime juice b/ c the veggie combo of zucchini, onions & garlic "called for "  a more Italian palate of spice for me ( think Ratatouile). I added the yellow bell peppers I had on hsnd, which upped the eye appeal and fiber - veggie goodness.  Found a Near East quinoa- brown rice medley that had rosemary- garlic  seasoning , and this just amped up the flavors nicely.

I LOVED THIS!!!!! I made it in a cast iron skillet so the veggies became a bit caramelized and were full of flavor. I substituted potatoes for the quinoa because I had baked some earlier in the day. This is definitely going to be a staple in our menu.

Good recipe, Easy to do for week night supper.
Detail, I should make bigger chuck for Zucchini and Tomatoes. Tomatoes almost disapeared from the mixture.

Really delicious! I use whatever squash is in season and replace the feta with goat cheese. I don't add chicken typically and it is still great. My one year old loves it and sings a chorus of "umm"s every time I make this recipe.

It's great!  I added a bell pepper to the veggies, this was my first experience with Quinoa and I kinda like it.  It taste a lot like rice but is supposed to be a lot better for you.  For a healthly meal you cant beat this one!!

I tried this before adding the lime juice and will definitely leave that out next time, better without in our opinion.  Gave it a weird tang. I just mixed quinoa in at the end and liked this all in one bowl meal. Can also cut back on meat and up veggies to make healthier. May look at other reviews for ideas on different seasonings.

What a delicious recipe! Whenever we eat this, the only thing that can be heard at our dinner table is mmmmm.....! The only thing that I tweaked was that I added a tomato and substituted 2tsp minced garlic in place of the garlic scapes. My new favorite dish!

Loved it!! Used 6 chicken thighs instead of breast. And increased the tomatoes to 2 large ones so it was a little more saucy. Amazing how the feta melted down with the tomatoes to make a creamy sauce...lovely dish..

Good recipe, but the flavor mix was different for us personally.  I added some cumin to the leftovers and it was a nice addition to the lime flavor.  I may try again and just omit the lime juice, add a bit more veggies, and some added fresh basil after cooking.  Also liked rice over quinoa.

Never tried quinoa before and oh man this is really great! I love it so much. I cooked quinoa with the rice cooker and because I dont like zucchini and I dont have fetta cheese, I just made that with diced tomatoes and it really turned out delicious. 
Next time I'm gonna add mushroom or another veggies like pakchoy or brocolli. Thanks for the recipe anyway. It's really yummy.

Loved it!! I did change it though.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts & I also left out the feta.  I added sundried tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes & I also added artichoke hearts.  For the quinoa, i used a pouch of the brown rice & quinoa from Costco. I mixed it all together & it was delicious!!

My family absolutely loved this recipe! I can see myself making this again and again. I used Organic Red Quinoa because that's what I had. I followed the recipe to the T. But, I also added Vegeta, Dry Basil, and ground Marjoram to the chicken breasts. What I did not use was the lime juice. And, that's only because I forgot to buy it. Ironically, my husband mentioned it as we were eating. "You know what would go good with this dish?" Lime juice. I chuckled!

Love this!! I changed it up a bit; I used 1/2 onion and 1 leek, shrimp and less chicken (ran out of chicken),  and I had no basil or lime. You can't really go wrong with quinoa and tasty veggies.

Really good.  This is the first time I made quinoa and I liked it.  But I don't think I would eat unless it was mixed with a bunch of other stuff like this.  I add mushrooms and I diced everything pretty small.  My family liked it too.

Very good and healthy; I'm learning how to incorporated quinoa into my meals and tried this one out on family. Hubby didn't like the quinoa but did like the veges and chicken; so this is one I will make again...just rice for him and quinoa for me.

This was very good and I felt really healthy after eating it. I do not make my quinoa with chicken or vegetable broth - so I omitted that. Also, I forgot the lime juice.... and really have no idea if that would've helped or hindered this recipe. It was good as is. I also didn't have 4 oz. of feta, but I love feta so I would add more next time. I also omitted the tomatoes (don't care for them) and steamed up some broccoli and cauliflower instead, then sauteed them with the zucchini. I loved this recipe! Also, I added salt & pepper to my chicken while frying that. Please give this recipe a try! It is good!

This was very flavorful, and the chicken was super juicy, even when making some changes with what I had on hand.  Substitutions: brown rice for quinoa,  whole frozen spinach for zucchini,  small can diced tomatoes,  whole garlic cloves,  1 tsp. dry basil,  1/2 tsp. sea salt. This is definitely a keeper.

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this was! My boyfriend ate two full helpings- unheard of! I found this recipe while searching for healthier weeknight alternatives to our usual meals which tend to be starchy and saucy. For such a simple recipe, it has incredible flavor! This recipe lends itself to improvisation. I added one small squash, half a red bell pepper, and a handful of fresh torn spinach. I can't wait to get creative with this recipe and add other goodies next time!

Very good, did not have enough Feta, so added Blue Cheese to the feta and it made it  rich but not to much. You could add any vegetable. Had extra spinach and it was great. Will do this again.

Really loved this recipe.  Stuck mostly to the script but added 2 tablespoons of butter to the quinoa once it was cooked.  Swapped out the garlic scapes for cloves since that's all I had.  Swapped the zucchini for 16 oz. of sliced mushrooms.  Hubby loved it and says this goes into the rotation, which is a coveted spot in my kitchen :-)

Very flavorful! My boyfriend loved it. I used garlic and herb feta instead. I only added a dash of salt but it came out perfect. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken so used that instead of breast chicken, made it quicker but next time I'll try raw chicken.

I didn't have garlic scapes or lime juice, so I substituted fresh minced garlic and lemon juice, and I added about 1 cup of thin green beans. I also added some chicken seasoning from a grinder I had. I had never had zucchini before, and was pleasantly surprised.  All the flavors seemed to compliment each other, and it was visually appealing as well.  My wife loved it.  Will be making again, possibly with stir fry vegetables added in.

Made this for my boyfriend and me last night ... It was his first time eating quinoa and he was a little hesitant. He ended up loving it and said he would eat it every night ! Going to try it with shrimp next time. I added some spices of my own ... didn't have fresh basil on hand so used some italian spices and added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. Will be making it again !

We loved this recipe!  I made it just after the holidays and couldn't get fresh basil.  So I substituted dried oregano and lemon juice.  Wow it was great with the feta!  I plan to add capers next time instead of added salt.

Awesome way to get veggies in my meals and super easy. I, too, changed a few things: I used a can of organic diced tomatoes, spinach (fresh) trimmed and placed on top of the quinoa before adding the chicken mix, and I had no lime, so I used lemon. I omitted the zucchini and the feta, but fresh mozzarella would have been good.

This was very good and easy!! Only thing I would do different is add the feta at the very end. And I cheated a little by using a box of quinoa/rice mix but threw out the spice packet (it was just the right amount and cheaper)

I loved this.  I didn't have garlic scrapes (actually I didn't even know what they were) so I just used some chopped garlic.  I'm sure this would be good with shrimp and just about any vegetable.

Update 6.23.16:
I have now made this many times. My family loves it. I have tried it with asparagus and shrimp and both are great. This is a recipes that lends itself to all kinds of variations.

Very good recipe.  I tripled the zucchini and added extra garlic powder and crushed red pepper while it cooked.  Next time I might try adding in some other vegetables, whatever is on hand.  Easy preparation...easy clean-up, no leftovers...just the way I like it!  This recipe would work great with shrimp. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night. I doubled the recipe so I could make sure I had left overs.  As with all good plans, my family loved this and I didn't 
have any left overs!  This was the first time making this recipe. The only thing I differently was using a can of seasoned diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes and I also used fresh chopped garlic.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe! I used chicken, red bell pepper, mushrooms, 2 garlic cloves and half of a large yellow onion. The basil leaves and feta cheese gave it some good flavor but I added curry powder when I was cooking the chicken for an extra kick and it was fantastic!

I cooked exactly as stated in the recipe, and it was pretty good. Oh, I did do one thing different, I used 3 tsp. dried basil because it all I had. It was very basil-y, and not as savory as I thought it would be. But it was good enough to make again. Next time I will add salt, pepper, and/or Tony Chachere's. My favorite thing was that it was healthy.

My Husband (eats everything) and picky Mother-In-Law, and I, loved this.   Perfect seasonings for us - Feta cheese gave it just the right saltiness!!!
I wanted to make sure it was juicy enough so I used four canned plum tomatoes (I doubled the recipe by the way) and 2 zucchinis, cubed.  Fresh basil.  2 limes.  Yummy!   And quick!!!  There was less than one portion left!

This is our favorite chicken and quinoa dish.  I like it just the way it is but I've also added other vegetables - whatever I had handy.  I've even removed the chicken to make it a side dish.  Yum!

Tasty recipe. I used minced garlic instead of garlic scapes, red bell pepper instead of zucchini (because that's what I had in my fridge), and lemon juice instead of lime juice (because my half lemon needed to be used). I also added salt and pepper to the chicken.

Cooked this last night, my 22 year old son took one look at it and said he wasn't going to eat it. From the moment he took the first mouthful till the last he was loving it, he even had seconds! The whole family loved it and I will definitely be making it again. Oh my son also has been telling friend to get the recipe from me because it's so yum!

Great recipe! We made it exactly according to recipe. This was way better than we expected just looking at the recipe. The feta and lime makes an excellent light sauce. This recipe is super easy, it only took a few minutes to throw it together. We loved it and will be adding this to the weekly rotation!

Easy to make and SO delicious. I didn't add the tomato with the veggies. I added homemade sun dried tomato on top with the feta. Came out wonderfully. I used half the oil and just a sprinking of feta. YUM!

This is soooo yummy and easy! I don't always add tomatoes it just depends if I have them or not. I through other veggies in too and it is always good! Thanks for a delightful recipe. I also use a Mediterranean blend of feta usually for extra flavor.

Yum!  I had to use garlic cloves because I didn't have any garlic scapes, and I used three  Roma tomatoes and put the zucchini in the food processor to finely chop it so that the kids would eat it.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly, and the whole family, including the kids, loved this dish.  This is a definite make again.

This turned out really excellent. I decided to go ahead and buy fresh basil instead of using the dried as I read some reviewers did and I'm glad I did! The fresh basil made all the difference in this dish. I used lemon instead of lime and added the feta when served (to accommodate the dairy allergies in my household) and it turned out really good. I think this dish would also be delicious as a vegetarian meal or with shrimp instead of chicken. Will definitely be using this as a "base" recipe to build on for upcoming meals!

This was my first time cooking with quinoa and this recipe was absolutely delicious!! My husband and I loved it. The mixture of lime, feta and basil give it a great contrasting flavor. I also added a little bit of fresh spinach. I will definitely be making this more often!!

Not bad! I made the following changes: Only used 2 Tbsp of olive oil instead of four, used reduced fat feta cheese to make it a little healthier, and I couldn't find garlic scapes so I went with a few cloves of minced garlic. Do not add ANY salt, the broth and the feta give it more than enough salt. I have been looking for a high protein meal for lunch and I will definitely be adding this recipe into my rotation.

I thought this was an absolutely tasty and healthful dish. My husband seemed to enjoy it too. it was very filling and we had leftovers. I did use an extra zucchini and a little less oil. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because my kids wouldn't eat it. But then again, they are kids and on a different day it might be their favorite food.

This was a very tasty introduction to Quinoa for me. I thought I had chicken broth o at least bullion but unfortunately had neither so I cooked the quinoa with just water. Next time I make this I will make sure to have the chicken broth to see how much more flavor it adds.

One of my favorite recipies - it has become a staple in our home. To be honest...  I don't measure everything and sometimes use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones.  But, it always turns out great!

I have been looking for other sources of protein, so I decided to try my hand at quinoa.  I really enjoyed this dish.  I used just a small amount of chicken and used up my yellow squash.  I did not add any salt, and used the low salt chicken broth.  The flavor was excellent and I think the feta made it extra delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This has become a favorite staple in our household! It's wonderfully yummy without needing to change a thing. The feta and basil really gives it a lovely flavor ~ I was hesitant at first but now chicken/feta has become my favorite combination! 

We take this dish to all get-togethers ~ and the ingredients can be prepared ahead of time and simply thrown together before running out the door.

The feta definitely added a special touch to this dish. Don't be tempted to add salt to this dish. The feta is more than enough to add great flavour to it. Very easy to prepare and such a treat. Thank you for the recipe.

AWESOME!!  I only made a few changes...I omited the second 2T olive oil, no need for it.  Instead of zucchini (I don't care for it cooked), I substituted a 12oz pkg baby bellas.  My pkg of feta was 6oz and I just used it all.  At the end, I mixed in the quinoa and a little while later, it soaked up all of the liquid.  Yummy!!

We really enjoyed this, the flavors were great! I never would have guessed that lime, feta and basil would go so well together! I am not even the biggest fan of feta, and I still loved this dish. It has everything: low cost, easy, delicious and healthy! The only modifications I used was a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh and thigh meat instead of breast meat.

Overall very good, but found it very salty. Next time I will try 1/2 broth 1/2 water to cut down on the saltiness - or maybe just all water.

Delicious!!  I only used just over 1 tablespoon olive oil total (you definitely do not need 4 tablespoons) and fat free feta.  It was fabulous - I can't wait to try it again with different vegetables.

Oh my gosh this is an amazing recipe!!!! I did make a few changes though. I didn't use basil just because it was expensive and I didn't know how I would use the rest of the leaves up because a bunch came in a package. I used Chef's Seasoning that I bought at Cub Foods. I added mushrooms too, and 1 Chicken Brat-Sun-Dried Tomato flavor, which I buy at Target. And instead of plain Feta cheese I used an Herb flavored one. Man, this is amazing!!! I will either eat it over quinoa or brown rice.

Very healthy recipe, substituted tomatoes with red peppers so it had a crispier texture.

This was the first recipe we tried with quinoa & it came out great!   My children ate it and really liked it (they even asked for seconds)!  My hubby who isn't too fond of trying new "health" foods enjoyed it too!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  The only modification I made was to trade out the zucchini for red and green bell peppers.  Thanks again!

Made this for diner tonight, it was delicious! Didn't know what garlic scapes were so just chopped up some garlic cloves.  Also didn't have any lime juice, so omitted that. Used some dried basil leaves, crushed up and added fresh pepper to the chicken as it cooked then more fresh ground pepper to the zucchini and tomatoes as they cooked. Overall, this was a fantastic recipe that I and my boyfriend enjoyed thoroughly. Will definitelt be making again and again, Thanks!

came out really good. The kids loved it. I did not have Garlic scapes, so I used minced garlic instead. Next time I would add an extra tomato.

I have yet to make this with chicken but I can imagine it would make this already awesome meal even better.  I added more veggies along with zuccini, I added squash, celery, onions.  More feta the better!

This was a very good meal for the healthy eater. I made mine on the grill in an iron skillet. A bit too much onion, but otherwise very tasty dish.

Love this!  I had never heard of quinoa or garlic scapes, but found the quinoa at the HEB market. I couldn't find garlic scapes and subsituted crushed garlic instead. My family loved it too.  Great tasting healthy meal.  Thanks

This is a tasty, easy dish, especially if you're a gardener and can find several of these ingredients in your backyard.  I am amused at the addition of garlic "scapes" - after a "what the hell are they?" moment I substituted a garlic clove and moved on.  The cheese melts to nothing, so I think I'd either add it later, or omit it completely if I was watching calories.  Had a lime on hand so I added the juice, but don't think I would have missed it.  As for the quinoa, it was my first time making it, tasty enough but for $5.99 many things, rice, brown rice, even mashed potatoes could have been substituted, I won't hurry to buy another box.  A nice, healthy dinner that won't break the bank.

This was delicious!  My entire family loved it. I've been wanting to try quinoa, but didn't quite know what to do with it.   I made the recipe as directed, but substituted sundried tomatoes for fresh tomato, because it was what I had on hand.   I loved the lime/basil/feta combo! The leftovers the next day were fantastic, too!

A great combination of flavors. As everyone does, we modified the recipe slightly but didn't stray far. The finishing touches of feta, basil and lime are really what make it great!

Very yummy!  This came at a perfect time...I had zucchini and tomatoes from our CSA this week and was wondering what to do with them. Followed the recipe with the exception of the garlic scapes - couldn't find them, so I substituted 3 cloves of garlic, sliced.  Very easy to make and didn't take much time at all.  Even my husband and son who "don't like vegetables" were clean platers! Thanks for a great and healthy recipe!

I thought it was full of flavor and very delicious.  I used a palmful of baby basil leaves, so it was probably more than the recipe called.  I had never heard of garlic scapes, so I just used thinly sliced garlic.  The hint of lime was a nice touch.

This dish was easy to make and was so delicious.  Definately will make again.  I added more tomatoes and zucchini for my taste.  Don't think the nutritional info. is correct on fat content.  Seems way to high for the ingredients.
