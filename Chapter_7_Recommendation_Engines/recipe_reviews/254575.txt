This was so good!   The mint jelly was fabulous.  Husband doesn't like mint....I left it out of his portion....and he loved it without the mint.  

Keeper and one I will share!

Loved the fresh mint sauce instead of store-bought.  The marinade for the lamb is also spot on.  I made pork chops in the same marinade for my husband and he loved it.

The marinade gave the lamb a wonderful fresh flavor.  I cold smoked the lamb for an hour then a quick hot sear.  The orange mint sauce is absolutely perfect and the best 'mint' sauce I've every tasted.  Well Done!
