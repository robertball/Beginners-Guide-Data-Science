I altered this recipe a little. For an even quicker preparation time, I used the already made pie crust (10in). But I had to put 18 servings into it! Instead of using cherries due to a picky husband, I used strawberry pie filling for the top! Turned out amazing!

This is such a good, classic dessert! One of the first desserts I made for my husband as newlyweds.    I have been making this for years and years, and yes, have substituted blueberry topping with equally good results, particularly good for 4th of July, made one with cherry, and one with blueberry!  All gone, no leftovers, ever!! It's a keeper!

Grew up with this dessert at family get togethers, it is so decadently delicious. The only thing different is I make it with chopped pecans mixed into the graham cracker crust.

I made this for a special occasion and was dissapointed.  The crust was soggy and fell apart.  This ruined it for me.

This desert brings back great memories-my mom would make this for her card club, and us kids would look forward to when the ladies left, so we could have some. When I make this I double the ingredients and put in a 9x!3 pan, and put half cherry and half blueberry pie fillings. So good.

We have made this as long as I can remember. We never used powdered sugar in the crust but instead brown sugar. And we have always changed up the topping...strawberry, blueberry, cherry, even chocolate. This is a great dessert and so easy! My grandparents ask for it everytime we see them. :)

I grew up with this dessert and it was always a hit. I have learned to adjust the butter in the gram cracker crust. If you don't like it and want it more like the already made crust just add more butter. Iam so glad you shared this with everyone. Great dessert.

Quick, simple, impromptu dessert that delivers satisfying results for little effort and a minimum of ingredients.  Trying to clear the fridge before we leave town and this was great to use up some odds and ends.  I scaled this way back, making just enough to layer into two small parfait glasses. Used real whipped cream and added a little vanilla.  Really good!  Very pretty too!

My card group loved this and all asked for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was using ginger snaps instead of graham crackers.  It's great for a change of tastes.

Wonderful recipe as is and easy to make changes to reduce calories if you want!  I use reduced fat cream cheese and no-fat whipped topping.  I have doubled the recipe for a 9 inch pie.  And you can use a prepared crust if you double the filling too!  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This is a classic recipe.  I made fresh whipped topping instead of using store bought;  and folded it into the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar.  It turned out wonderful.

We made this tonight for dessert.  I gave it four stars because of the artifitial Cool Whip taste.  I will use real whipped cream next time.  I think is will be a 5 star then.  Very quick and simple.

FOOLPROOF and EASY! Cherry Delight is a dessert my husband had been requesting and after failing to get his childhood recipe I came across this one.  We were both very pleased and now make it quite frequently.

In our area this recipe is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. There are a few slightly different versions of this wonderful treat, but all end up tasting the same.  My children have traveled the world and still think this is one of the best desserts they have eaten.  We try to have it at least once a year; usually at Christmas. Thanks for sharing with others.

Very simple. I left out the sugar from the crust, since the sweetness from the pie filling is enough!

Lovely! Used real cream which I whipped and folded in to the cream cheese mixture.
