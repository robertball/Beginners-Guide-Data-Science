This was like eating beets and yogurt!  The amounts of mustard and cumin should be greater.  It tasted good!

We eat this as a side dish regularly. I usually use ground cumin seed and pepper instead of the seeds.

Have to admit I opted out on the mustard and cumin seeds and doubled the amount of beets...there was more than enough sauce.  The cilantro really brightened up the flavor and it was delicious as is.  Great idea!!!

Used fresh beets and cooked them with olive oil.  Omitted the mustard seeds as I didn't have any and only used cumin, and a little salt and pepper.

Remarkably and surprisingly good, and so easy. Never had beets that weren't sweet & sour before so it was very different for me. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this exactly as written and did not like it because it had too much yogurt and not enough spice. I would recommend less yogurt--maybe start with one cup and mix in more if you want more, and increase the mustard and cumin if you want to actually taste them. As a fan of cilantro I was disappointed by how it made this taste. I don't see myself making this again.

This recipe is delicious, HOWEVER, the amounts of ingredients is  seriously off.
This recipe should have called for half of the yogurt.  Had that been the case, it would have been perfect, but to save this recipe, I had to add another can of beets and increase everything else.  In effect double the entire thing.
I liked it, but next time,  I will DEFINITEY  remember to cut the amount of yogurt by half, thus saving myself the trouble of having to go back and add all of the other ingredients called for in this recipe.
